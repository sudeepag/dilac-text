CHAPTER I. SPECULATION. IN the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty --- , at the hour of one, post meridian; the season November; the air chilled with the first stinging breath of winter; in the place where merchants then did congregate, commonly called "Change," two gentlemen confronted one another in the thickest of the crowd; the elder, a man fast verging towards his three-score years and ten, with scarce a trace of age except in his silvered hair; his form erect as in youth, with a step firm  and somewhat stately. The signet of sorrow, present sorrow, was on his brow, mingled with the indignation and wounded pride which flashed from his dark eyes, and spoke in his compressed lips, as he shook hands gloomily with his friend A few silver threads mingled with the dark locks of the younger man, but they were only here and there, among the brown curls t hat had, retained" : - their brightness, although their owner had seen, the snows of more than fifty winters.    -    -:    6       Hawtvhorndean. His bearing was soldierly, and the insignia on his shoulders marked him as a colonel in the United States' service. His countenance was by nature sunny, as one might see in the merry twin- kle of his gray eyes, but now sadness and sympathy gained the ascendency, as drawing the arm of his friend within his, they crossed the thoroughfare, making their way rapidly out of the busy mart. "I have come from the bank," he said as soon as they had left the crowd: " we have done the best we can for him. Benton will be allowed to go with- out further proceedings, though there are two strong voices against it; Commodore Greenwood, who has lost a pretty large sum, and has not a spark of generosity in him, and would be specially opposed to any act of mercy I might propose; and my cousin, Tom Sfapleton, who has no ties, and has spent twenty years of his life doing nothing, and has a plenty left, we need not waste our sym- pathy on him. - The-bank will not be able to pay fifty cents on the dollar. The old Commodore shook his fist in my face and vowed revenge; however, let it turn as it will, Philip Benton shall not come into the clutches of the law. He shall go to South America, Australia, or some far-off place first." "He has branded his family with infamy," inter- rupted the elder gentleman, striking the pavement with his heavy cane. "I trust he will go where I shall never see him." "Are you going up to the house?" inquired the other, as if unwilling to enter on the merits of the case. "Come and dine with us; will you?"   Speculation.        7 The questions followed each other without a pause for a reply. It came, however, after a moment. "Yes, I shall see Lucy again, and urge her to come home with me; a divorce can be obtained without much publicity. Thank you, I shall leave town before dinner. Good morning." "Divorce!" said the officer, under his breath, after his companion had left him. ".Never! it would be the destruction of both of-them." The elderly gentleman did not slacken his hurried pace till he paused in a part of the city distant from business, before an elegant mansion in --  Square. The blinds were down all ovper the house, and there was an appearance of desola- tion and neglect about the steps and sidewalks, contrasting with the well washed pavements of the adjoining dwellings. He waited but a moment, drew a long breath, and ascending the steps, he entered where he was no stranger. The stillness of death reigned in the halls and drawing-rooms, and his foot on the oaken staircase brought the first sound of life to his ear. "Dear, dear grandpapa," was the sound, and a curly head nestled in his arms, and he felt the little creature sob as he pressed, him to his bosom, and heard the whisper, "Papa has gone away off, and mamma, is so grieved, and sisters cry all the time, and Harold stamps his foot." "Sad times, my darling," said- the grandfather, taking. the boy to the nursery, where he found . the, elder sister resting her head on her arms inriSi;'  weary sadness, while Harold was striding across" the floor with the step of a grown man, pouring   Hawthorndean. brth his boyish thoughts, and chafing like a caged ion. "Where is your mother?" said the grandfather, lis voice fairly broken with the emotion caused  j by the sight of his grandchildren. "She is in her own room with sister Rosa," replied the girl, coming forward and putting up her lips for dear grandpapa's kiss. "My poor Marion," he said, pressing her to his heart, " you must help your mother bear this; it will kill her--" "It is worse than death," interrupted the boy; but the grandfather left the room before he could finish the- sentence. "Yes, Marion," he added, as the door closed after him, "disgrace is a great deal worse than death. Disgrace!" he cried, pressing his hand to his brow lest the tears should start; "I hear it everywhere, I see it in every face; all the boys have it. I wish we could all die, or take mamma to some desert island, and-" Marion came near and drew her brother into the recess window, to be out of hearing of little Willie, who was gazing with astonished eyes into Harold's excited face. "Harold," whispered the girl, "did you know we are very poor, very poor indeed? I heard the man who came about the furniture say we were not worth a cent. Everything must be sold, and we are to go somewhere, a great way off. Mamma told Rosa and me this morning; she had a line from papa to-day, and he wants her to leave one -of use with Colonel Hartland, to be his daughter;   Speculation.       g9 you know he has been papa's best friend, and but for him something more dreadful might have happened." "But you wouldn't leave mamma-in disgrace, too! O, Marion, how could you or Rosine think of such a thing?" "Of course I should not wish to leave mamma," replied the sister, coloring slightly, " but you know if papa wishes it, it must be done, and it would be less care for papa, we shall be so poor." "I don't care for poverty, Marion," said the boy, blushing crimson; "poverty isn't disgrace. I must give up college, and all that, of course, but I'm thankful we ,are going off. I don't care how far, if we could only get away from it; to have it flung at me that papa is -- . Q, Maribn!" and he threw himself in a paroxysm of shame on the couch which occupied the window. "Go away, Willie," said the sister, in a sharp voice, as the curly head peeped through the cur- tains, "we don't want you here." "Let him come," said his brother, drawing the ,child towards him. "Such a big boy cry!" said Willie, carefully wiping Harold's eyes. At this moment sister Rosine appeared with a summons from their mother. It'will be necessary here to bring forward what has perhaps been anticipated by the reader-the cause of the sudden sorrow that had overwhelmed in one moment a household that had dwelt for years in peace and quiet, enjoying all the comfortfs and luxuries of life. Philip Benton, the father, had   IO  -Hawlthordean. stood for a long term of years in a position of eminence as president of a large banking estab- lishment. He had ever borne a spotless reputa- tion. "He is too proud to be other than honest," was said by friend and foe. In an evil hour, when gambling in stocks was rife, Philip Benton made haste to be-rich, borrowed money of the institution for speculation secretly, but with no doubt the sincere purpose of refunding. A sudden revul- sion in the money market not only ruined him pecuniarily, but held him before the world-that world who had deemed him so honest-as a swin- dier, a man who had wilfully defrauded widows and orphans. The world is never pleased to be mistaken in the opinion she forms of any man, and the' tongue of reproach, in this case, was sharper -than a two-edged sword. The voices loudest against Benton were those who had been guilty of the same ,crime, but had the good fortune to refund the money borrowed secretly, before the panic. The discovery of his fraud had come upon Philip Benton like a shock of mental par- alysis, and but for his intimate and dear friend, Colonel Hartland, the .military gentleman whom we have already introduced to our readers, he would have remained, with stolid indifference, where justice would have claimedo him for the penitentiary. By the exertions of his friend, early and late,.the law was evaded, the matter com- promised with the creditors, and Benton sent to the then far West; his wife and five children were left behind, to follow or to leave him to his fate, as :they and their friends should determine.   Speculation.       I  The visit of the grandfather, Mr. Hawthorne, to his daughter, was to urge upon her a plan of his own. He had come from his beautiful country-seat, among the breezy hills of Connec- ticut, as soon as he had heard the distressing news, determined to take his daughter and the children to his own home. "Dear Hawthorndean, the early home of my Lucy,"he had said to himself, "what place on- earth can be like it to her, and here she can hide her sorrows from the world." Twice before he had endeavored to open the subject to her, but was checked by the utter pros- tration that followed this stunning blow. This day he found his daughter calm, but wearing the lines of unutterable sorrow in her wan face, and hands- that clutched each other continually.      : "Lucy, my child, listen to me," said her father, taking her clasped hands in his. "Let me talk to you of this; the time has come when I must speak." "Yes, father," she replied, looking up into his face with her tearless eyes, "to-day I can bear any thing. Philip, thank God, is safe from the hands of the law." "Rosine," she added, turning to her second daughter, who had scarcely left her mother since the first hour of her grief, "you may go to the nursery, and when I send for you, come with all the children. My precious comforter!" she added, as the door closed after her; "my dear ones!" "It is of them I wish to speak, Lucy," said her 'father, encouraged' by this first effort to 'talk of her family; ' I wish to renew and urge upon you   12   .   ]Hawthorndean. the acceptance of mylhome. Come, my daughter, you are welcome to all that I have. She who takes your mother's place in my household assures you- of an earnest, whole-souled welcome. I have none but you.; your children shall be my children; educated, trained as you please. I will this day settle a sum upon you and your children, sufficient for your support, if you will come to me. Haw- thorndean, your- early home, with all its tender associations, shall be yours, if you will leave your husband, give up one who has proved so unworthy of you-" "Please don't, father," said Mrs. Benton, with a shudder; "do not tempt me to be unfaithful to the vows made before God and man. You were the first to teach me my duty; you would not entice me from the path where you taught me to walk?" "But,. my child, consider your duties to your little- ones." "I have, I have," she replied, earnestly. "A path will be opened for them in the wilderness. It cannot be right for me, for the sake of their future in this life, to forsake one to whom I have promised to keep till death' 'they and their mother must follow the fortunes of their father. Let me tell you," she added, seeing him about to urge the matter upon her, "I have had a line from Philip to-day. Colonel Hartland, our noble friend, has offered him a home on a farm of his in Illinois, and we are to meet Philip as soon as arrangements can be made., The Colonel' has often begged of him one of his daughters; and now it is myy husband's   Speculation, ..       3- wish that I leave either Marion or Rosine with him." Mrs. Benton forced herself to communicate this intelligence to her father, but toward the close of the sentence, her voice became unsteady, and though no tears followed, she was seized with a violent attack of trembling, and some moments passed before she could 'recover herself. "My poor Lucy!" exclaimed her father, enclos- ing her in his arms, "tis is itoo much!" "Yes, I own,.I rebel against this requirement of my husband more than any he ever made." "And yet, Lucy, you are'my all; but you leave me in my declining years, taking away all-my precious grandchildren  except one, whom  you place with comparative strangers." Mrs. Benton looked imploringly into the face of her parent. "What can I do, and do   right? I know, dear father," she exclaimed, a bright flush kindling her pallid cheek for a moment, and pass- ing away like a shadow, "you shall have dear little Willie, your namesake, for a while at least. I will take the responsibility of leaving him with you, only asking," she said, pressing- his hand,ner- vously, "that, as far as you can prevent, while -he, is with you, no word or deed shall prejudice him against his father, or against the faith of his mother. Brighter days may restore us all to you, dear father," she added. "I will pray that it may be so, if it be the will of God, but I must follow my  husband." Mr. Hawthorne, finding his persuasions useless, thankled his daughter for this promised visit fronm  2                 ?  i   "     VHawthorndean. Willie, assuring her that during the period of separation the child should hold in reverence the faith of his mother, and the memory of his father; and then he sought to soothe his suffering child, but his irritation against the offending husband betrayed itself in every sentence. Mr. Hawthorne was himself an honest, upright man; probably a temptation to swerve from strict integrity had never crossed his path; he could not sympathize with one-who had been tempted and fallen. He had no pity, was out of patience, incensed with Mr. Benton, and though glad to rescue him from imprisonment, he was not willing to leave him the only ties that could save him from utter ruin. He left his daughter tremblingly alive to the disgrace of one who was dearer to her than life, and won- dering if she could be wrong in yearning to miti- gate the sufferings of that proud spirit, It was well for her that she had for many years, known' the only source of rest for the weary-hearted. It was a happy thing that in this time of her more than widowhood, she could look back to her youth, passed in the Ursuline Convent, Charles- todwn,where she had been placed for education, and where she had found what was far better than any learning-the priceless gift of faith. Her prin- ciples had been fixed and confirmed, in that fearful night when a Boston mob disturbed the peaceful inmates .of, that' shelter, and her only sister, a young/and delicate girl, had been obliged to flee, like the others of that community, to a place of refuge, the .fright and exposure bringing on the disease which caused her death. Nothing could   Speculation.'       15 afterward drive Lucy Hawthorne- from her position as a Catholic; she could only look upon dear Edith as a martyr, and the gentle reproaches- of her parents, and the scoffs of her early friends, were met alike by fixed determination. She had loved Philip Benton in the days of her childhood, and though he was of no faith, she would not go back from'her promise. He had respected the religion of his wife, and all his children had been reared in the Church of their -mother. A long deep reverie after her father had left her, bringing quietness and peace to her soul, was :broken' by a gentle tap at the door, followed'by, "May I come?" Mrs. Benton arose, and a slight agitation was visible as the door slowly opened, but a look'of relief, almost of joy followed, as :she embraced the new-comer. "Sister Agnes, I am so grateful to you for coming to me!" whispered Mrs. Benton, as the little woman in, the- black dress and cornet -of the Sisters of Charity, seated herself by Mrs. -Benton and took both her hands in hers. "Yes, I ventured to come toyou. I knew tfhat your own sorrows would not so overwhelm you that you would forget our dear House, and the orphans, that miss you so much." And- the shmall woman went on in a-voice like the lown murmilur of a distant ;stream, giving Mrs. Benton'the -sweet comforts of their mutual faith, and 'the last iitelli- gence from the House of-the Infant Jesus, of which she was Sister Superior, winning her 'thoughts for a time from her own grief, and bringing a gleam   16      lawethorndean. ,of, light fokr her for the future, in the memory of -how much She had been enabled to do for the poor unfortunates who crowded the streets of the city. "Our House is to have another wing, and this - week we have had a legacy which will help us to many things for our dear orphans," proceeded the -sister, as she -found the attention of her friend gained; "we had a'strong call this morning-six little orphans of one family, the eldest only fit for the nursery; some of: our good ladies sent me clothes for them at once, and-" "My means are cut off. I have nothing left that I can call my own," said Mrs. Benton, with a deep sigh. '4 O yes, dear, you have prayers; ah, if it wasn't ;for prayer, our alms would do but little good; besides, you have always been my Lady Bountiful; ,it is but fair others should take their turn. You must not have that pleasure all the time," said the sister, playfully patting. the hand she held, and looking through the tears in those happy brown eyes, like the sun peeping through an April cloud. "I wanted to see you to-day," said Mrs. Benton, changing the subject. "There is a( matter upon whichh I can ask advice of no one but you-not even Fat-her Roberts; he is sympathetic and kind, -but it seems to me he could not understand a -mother's; heart as you can. I want to ask which of my daughters I must leave behind when I go?" "Then you will go to your husband? I am -so glad," replied the sister. "ii knew you would; you will have God's blessing for it, and you wish   -Speculation.      ' 17 to leave one of the girls to comfort their grand- fatler?" "No, sister, I shall leave Willie with his grand- father for a while. I feel that he will be well cared for there; but my husband requires me to leave one of my elder daughters with Colonel Hartland; lie has no daughter, and has often seriously begged one from us, and now we are under such vast obli- gations to him,"--she paused, and the bright flush passed again over her face, and her voice almost failed her as she added, bowing her head in agony, "he has proved himself a true friend in our sorest need, and this is all we have to give him in return." "This comes upon you severely, Lucy; I will try to help you in your decision, if this must be." "It must," replied Mrs. Benton. "I must give up one of my girls, at an age when most they need a mother's care, to one almost a stranger, who will claim her as a mother, and worse than all, to people of another faith. This comes upon me (am I not sinful to say it?) more cheerlessly than my first grief." "It is your mother's heart, burdened at a time when you were not able to bear any addition, with a new weight, a terrible weight indeed; and the choosing between the two is no easy task; but we will talk over the matter. Marion is the more robust, and would better bear a western climate." "Yes, but Rosine's very delicacy seems to me a reason why I should keep her with me; then I remember that Rosine, though the younger, has the more established principles of action, is more firm in her faith, and better prepared to meet the 2*   138      Hf Iawthorndean. changes and chances of life. Marion is ambitious, and she might forsake the faith, at least she would feel it to be a great drawhack to her advancement in worldly -society; the world would fill her heart and head to the exclusion of better things, were she to be left to herself; therefore Rosine, with her sweet comforting ways, must be mine no longer." "Lucy, this' parting may not be for always; the time 'may come, and it seems to me will come, when some change will restore your child-oto your arms. Meanwhile all that I can do for her while I am left here, shall be done most gladly." "That will be a happy thoughts for me, dear sister; let her come to you often, you will warn her of danger, reprove her faults, and keep undimmed the memory of her early home, and above all, her mother's faith; it is too hard for me to break the intelligence of our separation to the dear child, and I trust it to you--you will find all the children in the nursery.?' , *                  ,^^    CHAPTER II. SISTER AGNES. MUST speak of dear Sister Agnes, over whose life, lovely and beautiful, the grave has but lately closed-Requiescat n .pace. At the tender age .of twelve, Agnes Shaw was left an orphan with a large fortune, to be wholly at her disposal when she had reached her majority. She' was educated in the family of her guardian, in all the pomp and parade of fashionable -life; every circumstance seemed to conspire to make her thoroughly worldly and selfish; but the good Spirit brooded over her heart, and with a naturally devout turn of mind, she soon came to eschew as vanity the aimless. round of fashionable living. To a strong, powerful will, she added a temper of unsurpassed sweetness; persevering, energetic, sometimes almost obstinate, she was necessarily somewhat eccentric in her efforts to live for a pur- pose; sometimes breaking away from all the con- ventionalities of society, and rushing headlong into her own plans of benevolence, which were often dangerous, and wholly impracticable from her posi- tion in society as a woman. But for her large I9   20      1hawthorndean. means and extraordinary good sense, she would have been deemed a candidate for the insane asylum by her companions, who could not com- prehend how one of their set could really love, a round of visits to the .dirtiest alleys of the city, to hear the tales of the poor, or to relieve some scene of wretchedness. They wearied themselves teasing her, and ceased their ridicule when they found themselves powerless to prevent her stopping the most miserable objects she met in her walks, and listening with unwearied ear to the unvarying tale of woe. They contented themselves with dubbing her, far and wide, as the "Protestant Sister of Charity." She pursued her way, in spite of remon- strances and entreaties, escaping sometimes from places and scenes of vice in its worst forms, as if by miracle. On one of these occasions she was preserved from insult by the providential appearance of a stranger, a gentleman, himself "on kindly deeds- intent." The acquaintance grew and ripened into a warm friendship for many years, before it cul- minated in that affection which- made the two hearts one. Mr. Pendleton had the qualities she most needed to complete her character, and from him Agnes Shaw first learned that there is a plea- sure in submitting to true and rightful guidance. Seldom does the sunlight visit a more charming abode than Fairview Cottage, just in the suburbs of the city. Devotedly religious himself, and an earnest Catholic, Mr. Pendleton soon taught his bride to love the holy ways, and partake of the spirit of the Church of which he was a devout ,t   ..       '  .'i*   Sister 4g'nes.      2 21 member. Together they made and executed large plans of benevolence; together they sought the sick, the desolate, the fallen, and brought them life and hope. Ten years of bliss, such as seldom falls to the lot of humanity, was the portion of these good people, when in, as it were, a single day, by a peculiar visitation, Agnes Pendleton was left alone; her noble-hearted husband, and two pre- cious children, were snatched from her arms by the ruthless stroke. The suddenness of the blast, the short space of one month, opening upon her in joy and peace, and shutting down in the end in a night of deep darkness, without moon or star; the very suddenness crushed her spirit, her energies gave way; her indomitable will, that had first learned submission through love, succumbed; she became absorbed in speechless grief. How mercifully our good Lord brings out of the direst evils good to individuals and communities! Mrs. Pendleton was first- aroused from the abstraction of her grief by one of those sudden and awful visitations that thrill a community to its very centre, and desolate so many homes in a single moment of time. Her soul was awakened by tile crash to its li-fe-object, and with a weary, aching heart, she gave all her energies to the sufferers. Fromn this beginning of action, her faith in the good God' revived, and at length she gave her property and her life to the Lord, as a -Sister of Charity. Not many years passed before her sweet, self-denying life, with -her energy and devotion, placed her at the head of the House of the Infant Jesus. "Sister Agnes," she was called,!wherever   22      .Hawthorndean. her-sweet voice and quiet determination were known. Destitution and suffering were the pass- ports to her favor. Mrs. Benton, the friend of her youth, had been her co-worker as a lay sister in the world for many years, and now, when the dark mantle of sorrow shrouded her friend, Sister Agnes was her earthly consoler.    - -            CHAPTER III. THE NEW  HOMES. THE drive of Mrs. Benton, with Rosine, to the new home of the latter, in Colonel Hartland's family, was nearly a silent one, each clasping the other's hand, each striving to hide from the other'how utterly miser- able this decree had made them for the time being. Many interviews had passed between the ladies of each family, in which Mrs. Benton'always made it plain that the sacrifice on her part was made as an act of obedience to her husband's wishes, and she did not conceal the hope that the separation was only temporary. She requested that her child should be kept untrammelled in the exercise of her religious duties, and that as special friends, she might often see Sister Agnes and her own pastor. Mrs. Benton felt, from her first conference with Mrs. Hartland, that there would be but little con- geniality between the worldly-minded and some- what stately person who was to take the place of mother, and her timid, shrinking child. Some- times she questioned whether the confidence and self-satisfaction of Marion would not have mingled better with the spirit and wishes of the Colonel's lady. She could not see that Mrs. Hartland was , 23   24      Hlawthorndean. rejoicing internally that the mother's choice had fixed upon the younger of the two girls, for she was but a school-girl of fifteen, while Marion was seventeen, and her two sons were yet bachelors, and at home, and she had a great dread of any woman coming between them and herself. She might bring a young Miss to a realizing sense of this fact, while a well-grown young lady might be too attractive before she could put out an anchor. She had received Rosine after much argument and discussion between herself and husband, simply because he wished it; she had an inherent dislike to girls. For his part, the Colonel was at first disappointed that the tall pretty Marion was not to be his daughter. He had never known Rosine except as a blushing child; Marion was more like his friend, Philip Benton, in his boyhood. He wanted a companion-daughter that he could pet, for his two sons were grown into full manhood, and had business and pursuits of their own seeking. Edward, the elder, was an established physician, utterly declining to follow the example of his father and brother and seek the United States' service, or be the tool of anybody, as he expressed it. He was full thirty years of age, of middling height, and being stout built, with broad shoulders and erect carriage, he had a more soldierly bearing than his brother Alexander, who was contented to serve his country as Lieutenant in the Navy. Alexander was the taller of the two, but neither as stout nor as straight as his brother. The doctor's prominent Roman. nose, and broad chin, with his keen gray eye, and thick dark hair and beard, contrasted with   The New Homes.       25 his brother's handsome features, Grecian in their outline, thoughtful hazel eye and profusion of light brown locks. They were the companions and pride of their fond parents, and had never made for themselves any other-permanent home than their father's house. Lieutenant Hartland was now on a furlough, waiting orders from the department, while his father served as commissary, and had resided for many years in the city. But we must leave Rosine, with the last words and tender caresses of those she loved best, in her new home, and follow her mother in the rough path she had chosen. Mrs. Benton, Marion, and Harold, with the little Jeannie, an infant of two years, took their depar- ture under the escort of Colonel Hartland, in the dreary days of November, for what was then the far West. At Chicago, (then the little one that has since become a thousand,) they were to meet the husband'and father, who had so clouded the happi- ness of his family. It may well be believed that Lucy Benton's heart grew sick in the prospect of this meeting, as they rounded the one pier that there invited thesteamer Madison to unlade her burdens. From -the window of the room where he had remained, Philip Benton saw the vessel glide down the lake- and anchor at the wharf; he knew the precious freight she bore for him, he felt the sacrifice his Lucy was making, but he had a mor- bid dread of his children. How could they, with their young honest hearts, look upon him with any thing but dislike? Once he resolved to brave the danger of meeting those that might recognize him; 3   26      Hawthorndean. and rush out to receive his family; but a sense of burning shame held him back,'and he sunk down :into a seat in the agony of remorse. He was not conscious how long his soul lay prostrate in this deep distress; suddenly two arms -were about his neck, and a kiss on his cheek, tears and sobs were about him, and a sweet voice came to his ear which said, "I have come, Philip; I am here, will you not -speak to me? we will be separate no more." He did 'not look into that face, where the sight of his stony grief had brought the first blessed tears; he could-only say, turning away his head, and writhing in- distress--"Cruel, miserable man that. I am, better that I were dead, than to bring you to, jhis!" ' "God has spared us to each other, Philip," said the wife; " we will go together and make ourselves a new home, and prepare for the rest which re- maineth for His children." "The child of God!" he said,- despairingly. "Call me rather, the child of the devil." "No, Philip dear, we will go back to our good Father in Heaven. He does not turn away from us even when we sin. He longs after us; He seeks us; we will find Him together. We have trusted too much in man, let us lean upon our dear Lord." "O Lucy," he replied, looking up for the first time, and- with a glance from his dark eyes that made her tremble, "but for you, I should have -been in the grave of the suicide. There were mo- mnents when I thought you would never come to me; that you could no longer cling- to one who had branded your name and your children's with   The New Homes.       27 disgrace. It was in one of those moments!that I nerved myself to take my own life; every thing was ready, when your letter came, saving my soul from this added crime." ' Blessed be His name!" said the wife, with deep earnestness. Hours passed before Mrs. Benton could arouse -her husband to the duty of seeing Col. Hartland and his children, but pleading love conquered. Marion rushed to her father's arms, eager for the first kiss ; but Harold held back. Mr. Benton saw at a glance how deeply the arrow of shame had struck into the boy's heart, but pride in the pres- ence of his child came to his assistance; pride, that grief and shame conquer last, and he quelled his son's slightly defiant look, by the glance of authority from which he dared not rebel. Chicago was, even at that day, the centre of trade and travel between the great East and the greater West, and was no place for the stricken family who sought seclusion. After two days' delay, they were ready for their further journey. Here they took leave of Col. Hartland, who, as a last act of friend- ship, placed in Mr. Benton's hand the deed of the farm to which they were going, recorded in Mrs. Benton's name. It was a galling, bitter thing, to the not fully bumbled heart of Philip Benton, to receive this new token of the Colonel's friendship; but his friend checked all the ebullitions -of this same pride, by declaring that all he could do would not pay for the dear little girl, whom he now called his own. A teamster, with his wagon and four stout'   28       Hawthorndean. horses, had been engaged to transport the family to their prairie home. He had come to the great mart, to exchange his wheat for his winter supply of groceries and other necessaries, and was glad of a load for his return to his log cabin, which was only a few miles from the farm to which the Ben- tons were bound. He was a true "sucker"; imported in his early youth from "York State," he was now identified with the soil on which he had grown to -the height of -six feet three, and broad in proportion. His wagon, the fashionable carriage of the times and place, deserves a description. It was as safe and secure, without the style and spring of a Fifth. 'Avenue turnout. It consisted of a rough wooden box, about ten feet in length by three in breadth, set down firmly upon the stout axles, on which turned the very cumbrous wheels. The top was a rag carpet, drawn over hoops of domestic manu- facture. There were no seats in the vehicle, except the front box for the driver, the usual method of being seated was in chairs arranged under the cover; but-Colonel Hartland, in view of the tender nature of the travellers, had procured a mattress and bed, which were' placed in the back of the wagon, to the great comfort of the party. Mr. Benton was expected to -ride on the box with the driver, but much to the joy of Harold, -he took his seat:with his wife and daughters, leaving his son to occupy that place. The owner of the establish- ment, Captain Rice, or "Old Cap," as he was called, made many vehement endeavors to enter into conversation with Mr. Benton, but finding his   The New Homes.       29 queries answered in the driest of monosyllables, or 'altogether unnoticed, he turned at length to the young boy by his side for companionship, and was soon filling the ears of the child with stories of the great crops, great snakes, and great people he would meet on the grand prairie. The commence- ment of their route lay through settled farms adja- cent to the city. The farms were laid out in sections, without any reference- to highways, or economy 'of time or travel, the roads leading around the two sides of every mile square. For the first time since the thunderbolt of disgrace had fallen upon Harold, the boy felt again the joyous freedom of youth, and aroused himself from the morbid dwelling in, the past, so unnatural to a lad of fourteen. Now he was away from men, and he did not read shame in all his surroundings. The broad prairie was before him, peopled with deer scarcely startled from their grazing by the noise of the cumbrous vehicle, and flocks of prairie- chickens, so tame that he could touch them with the long lash of the whip, of which he had relieved Mr. Rice. The road became more thinly settled as they advanced through long flat prairies miles in extent, uninterrupted by tree or rock. The course of every brook was marked by strips of timber on either side, varying in breadth accord-- ing to the volume of the stream they bordered. The timber was generally the chosen home of the Dutch and German, the Norwegian and the Irish, while the Yankee almost invariably pitched his tent on the broad prairie. The Fox river was forded the second day, to P   30       H-awzlorndean. the great terror of Mrs. Benton and her daughters, and the indignation of Harold, who inquired impa- tiently why these people did not bridge their streams, as they did at the east. Old Cap-grinned with his broad mouth, from each side of which a stream of tobacco juice ran down his rough chin. "I reckon," he said, spitting right and left, " it would take a right smart of{ men, and a power sof chink to bridge these criks (creeks) and slues (sloughs). I'd give a heap to see the chap that would start it, say on this Illinois crik." They were approaching the ford of the Illinois river, below the (then) village of Ottawa; the current was rapid, the water almost reaching the bottom of the wagon. "Them bottoms," continued Rice, giving each of -the leaders a smart cut; "was clean covered last corn plantin, them cabins all' under water." Toward the close of the third day Rice pointed out to the weary travellers the grand prairie, where was to be their dwelling. "Yonder it is, the perary," he said, tightening his coat, which we have forgotten to say was, like his nether garments, -of coarse linsey woolsey,. colored the invariable butternut dye of the country, and fastened with hooks and eyes. "I reckon you is a heap too far from folks to suit me; though there's old Buck off yonder," he added, flourishing his whip in another direction, "who owns thirty-two eighty acre lots, and swears he wouldn't. give his best friend an acre, to make a nigh settlement, 'twould spile his range, you see." "How much further is it?" inquired Marion, with'   The New Homes.       31 a heavy sigh, as she peered across the unbroken surface, blackened with the autumn fires, and unin- terrupted by tree, shrub, or fence. "A smart piece of three mile yet," replied the man. "I tell you Miss, you wont be plagued with sparks there." Mr. Benton drew Marion to his side, giving the man a look, meant to be annihilat- ing. Old Cap was daunted for a moment by the ferociousness of the look, but soon turned to Harold, and resumed the conversation respecting the bridges, which the boy thought a little eastern ingenuity might find a way to build across the streams and sloughs, not one of which since they left Chicago had been crossed except by fording. "Now youngster, here comes a reglar old he one," said Rice, as they entered a broad uncertain looking morass, covered with long rank grass which had refused to burn when the fire had swept over the adjoining ground. The man rose up, gave his horses several quick cuts with the long whip, at the same time yelling at the top of his voice, "Up Zeb! hi Job! out with it Pete! stir up Fan!" The faithful creatures plunged into the mud, scrambled through'in a manner frightful to behold, and aided by the encouraging screeching of the driver, and the frequent application of the goad, even this difficulty was overcome, and the wagon- with its precious freight was drawn out on the other side. "I reckon they're up to the scratch," said Rice proudly, as the wearied horses stood panting after the fatiguing plunge. "Neighbor Hendig spiled one beast here last wheat harvest, now mine you see is as piert as ever."   3.2 --  - ',rawthorndean., "-:t-js a shame to use them so " said Harold, colorHhg with indignation. "Well, stranger," replied ].ice, coolly spitting a stream of tobacco which shot as directly between the ears of his off forward horse as if it had been, aimed from a pistol, "if you don't like it, next time you may unlight and try your own pegs." It was sunset on a raw November day, when the family reached the small frame house in the middle of the farm, that was now the only spot they could call home. Colonel Hartland had dispatched a message to the tenants, to prepare for the reception of the family, and the coast was clear. The house consisted of four rooms, a kitchen, two bed-rooms, and a-large unfinished attic over all. A barn and stable were on the premises, besides many New England conveniences, which Mr. Rice summed up as "cute traps." The house he considered quite spacious, indeed he said, "it might be taken for a meetin'us, as it was so grand." After he had run through all the buildings with- Harold, he took leave of the family, extending his hand for a parting shake with Mr. Benton, and saying, "Well, neighbor, I shall draw Smith's wheat to Chicarger, and if you want any fixins, I'm your man." Mrs. Benton's more delicate nature appreciated the true kindness of this neighbor under his very rough exterior, and taking the offered hand that Mr. Benton had met by a cold bow, she took leave of her rustic friend, urging him to come and see them again., Indeed, to her he seemed in a way the last link that bound them to the world they had left, a link which she was reluctant to sunder.   CHAPTER IV. PRAIRIE   LIFE. WE shall pass over the first trials of the strange new home on the prairie; the dreary heart-aching for absent ones, and the oppressive home-sickness. The sea- son of the year was unfavorable to contentment in a region so far removed from society, and from all external privileges, both social and religious. It required all Mrs. Benton's unwearied love and single heartedness, kept alive by her firm faith, to make the trial endurable; but "Come what come may, Time and the hour runs through the roughest day." A streak of light came with the dear home furniture, from which, in the breaking up, Colonel Hartland, with true tact and refinement, had selected such articles as he knew would be most prized, and forwarded them to the prairie home. The precious books, which they had never hoped to see, one or -two of the most beautiful and familiar pictures that had adorned their city home, and strangest of all, the piano. "It was kind of the Colonel, but where were they to put it?" was Mr. Benton's inquiry. Marion gave her first smile as she ran her fingers 33   34-       -awthaorndean. over the keys, and soon found a place for it. But more precious than all, were the long letters from dear home friends. None can give thanks more heartily for the blessing of the mail, than they who are fixed in some far off land, away from all that has hitherto made life's comfort and hope. The new home was in the midst of a vast rolling prairie, known in Illinois as the "Grand Prairie," from its superiority over all others in extent of sur- face. Away to the north-east, at the time of which we speak, the vast wilderness of grass stretched itself for more than a hundred miles without a set- tlement. On the south, at the distance of three miles, was a narrow strip of timber, the tops of the huge trees visible on the horizon from the door of Mr. Benton's. cottage. Three miles to the west was the village of Athlacca, in whose territorial boundaries they were included, and which boasted two stores and eleven houses, besides a long build- ing once used as a warehouse, but which had risen 'to the dignity of a court-house; Athlacca by a change of county lines, having become shiretown of the county of W  . About the village, log cabins were scattered on the prairie, and througl the adjoining timber land, so that in the town proper there were perhaps three hundred inhabi- tants. There was, neither school-house nor house of religious worship of any kind in the region, though the Campbellites, the prevailing sect, held forth occasionally in the court-house. Unused to manual labor, SMr. Benton passed the winter in what was to him hard work, making preparations for the coming spring. He had no assistant but   Prairize- Lzfe.      35 Harold, who worked most unwillingly, for he had a strong distaste to farming; but work he did, early and late, his evenings and an occasional excursion with his gun being his only recreations. Letters came from Rosine regularly at first, and written. with all the affectionate freedom of her nature, but gradually the mother's eye could detect a more formlal wording, less of sentiment and warm out- gushing feeling, and more of fact and circumstance. Father Roberts, the friend and pastor, did not forget his absent children, but sent them many an encour- aging word and expression of Chritian sympathy. Sister Agnes too, with her blithe, appy nature--a nature made more sympathetic by her own sor- rows-cheered many a lonely hour for Mrs. Benton with news from the House of the Infant Jesus, and now and then a bit of intelligence from Rosine or Willie. Mrs. Benton wrote more freely to her than to any other person, but for this vent to her over- charged heart, she must have sunk under the burden of her cares and trials.  Marion was wretched, and wandered about the house while she assisted her mother in their household duties, with an air of sullen discontent. She continually mourned over the contrast between her position and that of her sister Rosine, andwondered what was the use of living, if they must live thus. Har- old, proud and high spirited, hated nothing in his situation but the manual labor- which his -father exacted from him. He did not mind being out of the world; to wander over the prairie with his horse and gun was pleasure enough, but to bend his neck to toil as a farmer, was utterly dis-   36       Hawthorndean. tasteful to-him. Mr. Benton was all tender defer- ence to his wife; there was even an awe and rever- ence in his demeanor towards her, a contrast to his former self-reliant assurance of being obeyed; he was, also gentle and forbearing with Marion, but stern and sometimes harsh with his boy. The memory of his own unrestrained self-will and pride rankled in his bosom, and when he saw the same spirit in his child, he felt that it was in his power, and right that he should crush it. He failed to sympathize with the wound he had himself made in the breast of his son. This misunderstanding between father and child was a constant source of anxiety to the mother, who saw the noble nature of her boy in danger of being turned into gall and bitterness. It was after an outhreak between them, when Harold had declared he would serve in this way no longer, and the father had threatened severe measures, that Mrs. Benton, not daring to go between them, had retired to her bedroom, when the fol- lowing letter from sister Agnes was brought to her. It was like the voice of an angel. "HOUSE OF THE INFANT JESUS, Feb. 18-. "MY DEAR LUCY: "Thank you for writing me freely. No, it cannot be wrong that you should have the sympathy of one who has known and loved you so many years. I am concerned with you about the dear children. What you told me of Marion made me a little indignant; what you wrote of Harold grieved me. Afs you say, a mother should never come between father and son to interfere; but is not Mr. Benton's e   Prairie Life.      37 a mistaken idea of duty? If Harold could be sent away to some business or trade, would it not be to his advantage? and yet he is so young to leave you. Good Father Cote is in St. Louis, and that is not so far from you but he might help you. You remember how grateful he was for the kind !hand you extended to his orphans in cholera times. If I were you I would write to him, or see him, which would be better. I am confident he would rejoice in an opportunity to do you a kind- ness; and if Harold were at St. Louis, under his care, your anxieties would be lessened. A few years will change both father and son, and they will come together again with different feelings. I can understand that the two natures must chafe and irritate each other continually, thrown together -so entirely. With regard to Marion, I find it diffi- cult to speak as I wish, because I am a little angry with her, that at her age she should not better appreciate her mother's trials, and manifest less self-absorption. Dear child! a little sternness on the part of her father would be a real blessing to her. Anything like a cross is so new, but she is young, and will be wiser by and by. It was well you kept her with you, for her nature would hardly bear the'petting that dear Rosine meets, without becoming utterly selfish. Perhaps if you could, for her sake, overcome the repugnance you feel to making the acquaintance of the people about you, she might find something to interest her. Your plan for a Sunday-school for the Catholic children is admirable; it would be such a blessing for them, and a source of comfort to you. Marion would   38       Hiawthorndean. be a help to you there, and be doing herself good by teaching others. You will all be happier when your good Bishop sends you a priest; God grant that time may not be far distant. Rosine I see occasionally; the family of, Colonel Hartland occupy most of her spare moments. I am not afraid of their turning the dear child's head with worldly amusements, for she comes to me with the same sweet loving way she always had toward you, with her little troubles. She is very prudent, but I gather from what she tells me, that Mrs. Hartland overlooks all her letters; this may account "for. the slight reserve and formality you noticed in them. When she mourns for: you, as she does sometimes inordinately, I try to teach her to live in the present hour by the performance of every duty, and to trust for the future in the tender care of the Good Shepherd, commending her earnest wish to be restored to you, to the prayers of our Blessed Mother. "Your father and Willie called here this week for the last news from you. Our dear House is prosperous, the last collection was very large, but a mass of sin and wretchedness lies all about-us unrelieved; only to-day three unfortunate girls were brought to me, the eldest -scarce sixteen; their stories would make your heart ache.  But my household calls to me; tell me all that interests you, for it is all precious to your affectionate sister,               AGNES." As Mrs. Benton folded this letter, her husband entered the room to which she had retired. It   Prazirie Lfe.      39 !II was dusk, she could not see his face, but she knew by his step and manner that he was'in a stateiof excitement. "Where is Harold?" was her first inquiry. "In his room," replied the father. "I have sent him to bed, with the promise of a flogging in the morning. I have tried all other means, this is a last resort. I should have finished the matter to-night, only I did not dare trust myself." Mrs. Benton -approached the door as though she would leave the room. "Don't go to Harold to-night," he said, With something of his old authoritative manner. ;," I wish him left to himself. That boy's pride and wilfulness shall be broken; one of us must be master, and I intend that point shall be settled forever to-morrow." "And will you settle it by brute force, Philip?" she said, gently, "and break the last link that binds you to your boy. Consider, my dear hus- band, Harold is no longer a little child, and if his will is ever subdued, it must be bylthe blessing of Divine help on his own efforts." "And in the meantime, Lucy, you would have ine submit to his insolence?" "Philip," she replied, her voice trembling with emotion, "it is you that are wilful now. You know"-she hesitated-"you know that of late years you have been so absorbed in business, that Harold has been left during the time when whip- ping might have benefited him, and now do you expect, by one chastisement, to subdue what it. takes a lifetime to govern?"   40       Htawthol'zdean. At the mention of his absorption in business, Mr. Benton sunk into a seat, his proud, haughty manner vanished, and 'his head bowed upon his hands. "I meant no -reproach, Philip dear," said the wife, sinking on her knees beside him, "you know I would not be so cruel;- but pity this dear boy, by the memory of the past." "Yes, Lucy," he said, bitterly, "what right have I to punish him, who go free myself by a mere act of friendly compassion? O God! would that I had died in early childhood. I hope Harold and Willie may both go before their manhood. To live, marked with such a stigma as I have brought upon them!  Why did you come to me? Without me, perhaps, in time they might have recovered from the disgrace; with me, it clings to them forever. Good God! what shall I do?" he exclaimed, in a despairing tone. "He saveth to the uttermost, dear Philip," replied Mrs. Benton in a low voice. He did not reply, while she led him in thought to the fountain of all comfort, soothing his spirit with the solace of her own bright faith and trust. At length, when his emotion had somewhat subsided, she ventured to return to the subject. "You will recall your deci- sion that- I should not see Harold to-night, will you?" she said pleadingly. "Yes, Lucy, and my promise to him also-go," he said without looking up. In a  moment Mrs. Benton was by Harold's side in the low garret before mentioned. The boy had thrown  himself on the couch, not having remoied   Prairie Life.       41- his powder-horn from his belt, nor his boots from his feet. His gun lay on his -pillow, and his head rested on it, his face downward, He was not weeping, but hardening his heart against his father, and he did not look up or speak as Mrs. Benton laid her hand on his head. "Harold, my boy," she said gently. "(It's of no use, mother," he replied somewhat petulantly-" no use to talk. I wish I dared," he added, his voice trembling with anger. "'I shall do 'it," he continued, turning around to his mother and raising his hand earnestly, "I shall do it, if father flogs me. I would have done it before, but for you," he added, his voice softening almost to tears. "Done what, Harold, my - darling son?" she inquired, holding his reluctant hand. "Cleared out-runaway-to California-to sea- anywhere, but where father is. I believe he hates me!" he exclaimed with a flash of his dark eyes, which showed too plainly that hatred was seek- ing a home in his breast. "Harold," replied his mother, "you are wicked, rebellious. God is displeased with you, I am dis- pleased with you. You said you would try to do' better; would not answer again, and thwart your father's wishes." "I did try, mother, I did--but to be taken hold of, and talked to as -if I were a dog! Father almost swore at me, and said--" "Hush! my son, I don't wish you to repeat your father's words to me. You know your duty- ,obedience-submission. Ah, Harold you have for- gotten the promises you made to Father Roberts   42       Hawthorndean. the day of your first communion, to be a comfort, and not a care, to your dear mother in her banish- ment from home.' I expected better things of you." She paused a moment, then continued, "Shall it be you, my first born son, my pride, my joy, that shall be the one to break my heart, and lay me in the grave?" The boy started from his pillow, threw his arms about her neck and whispered, "No, mother, I will bear it, I will bear it. Only let me be a comfort to you. Forgive me, I have done very wrong. I will do any thing you wish, only forgive me." The morning after this conversation, Harold'did not appear at the breakfast table.- Mr. Benton looked haggard and worn, as if sleep had forsaken his pillow, but he despatched Marion for her brother. She found him unable to lift his head, his whole frame burning with fever. He had tossed all night on his sleepless couch, unwilling to dis- turb his mother. "He must be brought down stairs," said Mrs. Benton, when she had visited his chamber, " the air in the garret is stifling." Mr. Benton arose without a word, and soon appeared with Harold, whom he carried as gently as a woman, and laid-him upon his own bed. In a few moments, as his mother sat fanning his hot brow, his face suddenly became deadly pale, with a purplish hue about the mouth and eyes, accom- panied with a chilliness which shook his whole frame like an aspen leaf. "It is fever and ague," said his father; "the night air has done its work." "Yes, papa," replied the boy, manfully, his lips   Prairie Life.      43 quivering, "I disobeyed you when you told me not to stay out in the dew. Will you forgive me, and punish me- as you think best?" "You are punished sufficiently, my boy," said the father, turning away to the window. The mother sat by her son many days, as chill and fever succeeded each other; he grew-at length so weak that Mrs. Benton was anxious for medical' advice. As she was consulting with her husband on the possibility of sending ten miles for the nearest physician, they were saluted by a man on horseback, who rode up to the outer door without dismounting, and rapping with the heavy riding whip, shouted, "Stranger!" after the manner of the country. Harold's eye brightened as he recognized the voice, when neighbor Rice was ushered in. "So you're doncy, my fine chap," he said, shak- ing Harold's hot, parched hand; "but come, pluck up, you needn't be any ways scared, it's nothin but the ager shakes. My woman has 'um to kill, but hers is -mstly dumb-chills; wust kind, cause they're all inside on you." "What does she do for them?" inquired Mrs. Benton, anxiously. "Why, she tuk heaps of truck, queenan and marcery, morfine, and yarbs of every natur, till I lit upon the yarb as did the business, the red centery plant. Sure hit, now I tell you; powerful good for them chills. I'll have some along to you. Whar's that mighty pooty young un of yourn, Mrs. Benton?" he said, when he found Marion did not appear. "I allowed she'd be the homesickest gal in these diggins."   " '     Hawthorndean. Mrs. Benton called her daughter, and as she saw the wondering gaze the neighbor cast upon the piano, she proposed Marion should play for the amusement of their guest. Marion went about the task rather unwillingly, while Old Cap laid his head down on the instrument to listen, went down on his knees to look underneath, and peeped won- deringly under the sounding-board. "Waal, now, 'pears like that's a squeaker," he said, as Marion arose from her seat; "that's what you call a piarner, is it? Them fingers go it, I V OW."  From the piano he wandered around to the books and pictures that adorned the one room, that served as dining-room, library, and kitchen. As he closed his survey, he looked at Mrs. Benton with a satisfied air, and said, in a tone meant to be final, "Waal, I reckoned your man was a parson; but bless me, it's nigh dew fallin', and I must get along. Don't go tur sendin for no doc- tor's truck; the less on't, the better. I'll send the yarb along." As he w-as closing-the door, he was reminded of the errand that brought him, so he must come back into Harold's room, leading a dog, which, as he said, he " had brought over to keep the young- ster company." The puppy was a noble fellow, a cross between the greyhound and bloodhound. "The young uns call him Turk," he said, somewhat confused by Harold's overwhelming thanks. "You must keep him straight, youngster. I reckon it is with dogs as with chaps; if they aint licked young, they'll   Pir-airie Life.     45  show their teeth, and won't budge when you tell 'urnm." Harold colored painfully, the color seemed to extend to his father's (heek and brow. Mrs. Benton hastened to change the subject, by speaking of the proposed Sunday-school for the children of the foreigners, thinking his kindness of heart would lead him to assist her in getting them together. She was not mistaken in her venture. He proposed to speak to the -parents himself, adding with true American, not to say Catholic spirit, "We ain't no furriners here, it's all one; Dutch, Irish, Germans, or Yankees, and as to the Catholic part, I reckon it's better'n no religion. They used to have them doins down in York State, and I never heerd tell no harm come on 'um. You may have my six young uns for all me, to get your hand in.'  Mrs. Benton thanked him for the encouraging words, gave him several small books for his chil- dren, and he went away much pleased, reporting to Athlacca newsdom that "them Bentons was grand folks, but drefful good-hearted, all but the old man, who was a reg'lar Injun." L        Q   CHAPTER V. CITY LIFE. WE will now leave our friends on the prairie a while, and return to Rosine Benton, and her life in town. She was, as Sister Agnes had written, a pet in Colonel Hart- land's family, especially with the Colonel himself, who placed her at school in the best institution the city afforded, and gave her every opportunity for intellectual and physical culture. Besides this, she had carte blanche to come to him for money whenever she wanted it. Mrs. Hartland was not the woman to allow any thing in her house not subject to her inspection, and Rosine soon under- stood that it would be more comfortable for her, if she submitted her letters to her perusal. This was a sad trial, but so often did the lady hint and speak about openness and candor as the best of virtues, that Rosine felt a sense of guilt if she folded a letter without first submitting it to Mrs. Hartland. This was a very unhappy and annoying arrange- ment, making her letters to her mother, which should have shown her heart, merely the outside transcript of her feelings and actions, particularly formal and cold when -treating of her inner life. "   City Life.       47 For a long time she could never write or receive a letter without a bitter struggle with the thought that all true interchange of heart between herself and her mother was cut off. Had she summoned courage to hint her wishes to the Colonel, he would at once have put an end to this system of surveil- lance, but she was timid and shrinking, and feared to seem complaining, and so the matter remained. In spite'- of this great obstacle to her comfort, Rosine's light-hearted, active nature, after awhile accepted this' circumstance of her life, and ceased to mourn so bitterly over what- she could not help. Her faith was left untouched; the family having no special creed, did not meddle with hers, and if she found no help, she found no opposition in the practice of her religious duties. Colonel Hartland strove to make her time pass pleasantly, and carried her to places of amusement, of which before she had only heard the name. Tlhey had hurried their late dinner one evening in January, that Colonel Hartland and Rosine might be in season for the opening of the opera. Mrs. Hartland did not care to go into such a crowd, and the Doctor had come in after his professional labors, bound for a quiet evening at home, while the Lieu- tenant had been housed for a few days with a severe cold. "I have never had an- opportunity, Ned," said the Colonel's lady to her elder son, as they ad- journed to the library, " to hear how you like your new sister. You know you promised me your opinion in a month, it is now more than two since she came to us."   48     -]a Hawthorndean. "I have as yet hardly established a friendly footing with the little one," replied Doctor Hart- land, lighting his cigar, and throwing himself into a luxurious arm-chair with his feet on the fender. "I frightened her terribly the first week of our acquaintance, by laughing at the way she has of becoming crimson with blushes at the slightest word; if one only speaks, she is like a startled fawn looking about for her mother. I gave her so severe a lesson on the subject of timidity, that she was dissolved in tears, and my gallant soldier brother would have come to the rescue, but I gave him his quietus." , "You were too hard on the young thing, Ned," said the Lieutenant, looking up from his book. "Please to attend to your own affairs, Aleck. I defy you to teach her any thing with your namby- pamby ways. Miss Rosine and I will be fast friends, you will see; she is the shyest piece of hu tn flesh and blood I ever met. Time and experince will mend this -matter, it is to be hoped, and we shall be able to speak to my timid sister, 'Nor call up all The blood that warms her trembling heart, To fill her cheeks with blushes.' She'll make a charmning pretty woman by and by; one would suppose she had been all her life in a convent." "She has been kept .very -strictly, at home," replied Mrs. Hartland. -"Mrs. Benton is very straight-laced in her notions; but by your account I should think you had succeeded in frightening   City Life.        49 the child pretty thoroughly,  Do you. believe in governing by fear?"   "I believe there is no true,love or friendship without it," said the Doctor, "especially in the com- mencement; that's why you see me A bachelor. I never could love a, woman unless I stood- some- what in awe before her, and I have never seen but one where acquaintance did not wipe off the bloom of love, which is the fear. As to my dear brother -here," he added, pointing to the Lieutenant, "he has such a profound reverence for the whole sex, that he will never have any other feeling. There's Captain Marten's daughter, just ready to eat him,: shoulder-straps and all, but the poor fellow stands in such awe, he doesn't dare venture near his clay idol, to see if it will bear-touching." "Pshaw, Ned! Laura Marten! Aleck has better taste." "Speak for yourself, old fellow," retorted the brother; "I think I saw Miss Marten in your office this afternoon. Perhaps it is immaterial to her which bird she captures." "A bold, impudent girl, boys!" said Mrs. Hart- land. "I hope you will neither of you have any thing to say to her. In your office, Ned? What business i has she, or any other young girl, in your office?"           - "I should say that was a silly question, if my mother hadn't asked it," replied the Doctor. "But we were speaking of Rosine," he added, peremp- torily closing up the subject of Miss Marten; "she has fine intellectual powers; thorough, too, in all she undertakes. I like that, but she's too dread-   50       ]-awthorndean. fully pious. I am willing a woman should be decently religious, but these women, righteous overmuch, are dreadful bores. I don't wish to meddle in that matter, it isn't my province; but I trust when she goes into society, this amazing scrupulousness will wear off. This growing inti- macy with Laura Marten will help the matter; please not to disturb the friendship, mother. They must be counterparts, according to one definition of the word." It Was true, all that Edward Hartland had rerated of his conversation with Rosine. He had fright- ened her so essentially, that for weeks she was like a fluttering bird in his presence, and yet he had mingled so much of apparent interest in her wel- fare with his reprimand, that she reproached herself 'with ill-nature and ingratitude, when her heart rebelled at his severe words. There was that in his counsel which strangely confused her tender conscience. There was a strangeness too about the intimacy between Laura Marten and Rosine, but it was easily accounted for, by the circumstances under which it commenced. Laura was three years older than Rosine, bold and fearless in her man- ners, with noble and generous -impulses, but inor- dinately' fond of admiration, and by no means discreet or prudent. She was one of the elder girls in Madame Le Place's boarding-school, when Rosine entered a stranger. During recess, a few days after her admission into the school, before she had made any acquaintance with her schoolmates, a group of girls, separate from those who had joined in the games which occupied most of the   City Lte. 5I scholars, was gathered near a window where Rosine had seated herself as spectator. They were making their eager comments on the new scholar, as she soon learned, when she heard her -name. whispered among them. !"Miss Benton "-"Romanist "-" her father"- ( defaulter "-" swindler "--" fripon "--"chevalier d'industrie "-" run away." Rosine felt the mantling blush of shame rising to her cheek as the undertone met her ear, and the -tears came into her brown eyes; when suddenly, as if she had dropt from the clouds, Laura Marten's brunette face appeared among the knot of girls, and her authoritative voice was heard. "Bessie Varnum, be quiet. Lizzie Conant, stop your affected French nonsense. I tell you, girls, it wont do to look too strictly after your paternal heads. Your father, Bessie, everybody knows, made his money by cheating the government; and yours, Lizzie, by making wine, well-out of any thing but grapes. I advise you to be mum." She then came to Rosine, and reducing the tone of her voice to a whisper, said, "Don't mind those simpletons, they are not half-witted: come with me to the obser- vatory.' They- mounted the stairs leading to the top of the house together, Laura chatting away upon indifferent subjects' till they reached the cupola. This was a favorite resort for the young ladies on a fair day; the look-out was extensve, commanding a view down the bay and harbor. quite to the open sea. But to-day the snow was gathering fast, covering everything with its white mantle. The wind howled and the dismal clouds   52       Hawthorndean. in-the distance portended a long storm; the thick falling flakes filled the air, so that Rosine could only distinguish the tall masts of the ships at anchor, and no arid then a- glimpse of the angry sea.  ' O, how I wish I were a man!" exclaimed Laura, as she endeavored to make her companion see a vessel in the distance, striving to enter the port; "I'd like to be out there, dashing over those foam- ing waves, instead of being mewed up here all my days, to dig and delve into these abominable hea- then languages, when if I had only had the good fortune to have been a boy, I might have been cruising with my father on the coast of Africa." "Haven't you any brother, or sister?" inquired Rosine. "Not a scion but poor me, and I shall never do -anything to distinguish myself, unless I disguise -and offer myself as a middy." Rosine looked at her, with horror depicted in her countenance.. "Don't be taken aback," continued Laura, laughing at the consternation of her new friend, "I'd go through fire and water if I could enlist; but after all; freedom as I am is better than the slavery of the service, and I dare say I should desert the first chance, but I do want to see the world." "-Where is your mother?" said Rosine, gaining confidence by the free and easy manner of her companion. "My3 mother's last hour came with my life," replied Laura, her countenance becoming grave. "Ah, if she had lived, I should have been more   it        Cicy Lzfe.       53 like other girls, but 'twas to be, as tny old Aunt used to say," she added, with something between a sigh and a laugh. "You are very lonely," said Rosine with real pity, " you must come and see me. Colonel Hart- land wished me to invite any of the girls I liked." "So you like me, do you ?" replied Laura, giving her a quick, hearty caress, "thanks; you shan't repent it." At that moment the gong resounded through the halls, summoning them to recitations. "Don't let me hear you ' Miss Marten' me, you little chickadedee," said Laura, as they went into the hall together, "unless it be 'High Betty Marten,' after the manner of Dr. Hartland." Thus the intimacy commenced; there was a counterpart to Rosine's timidity in Laura's fearless- ness, and the younger girl clung to her friend in any emergency. Laura-was the last companion Mrs. Benton would have chosen for her daughter, for she had no training, or sense of responsibility, except to her own all-powerful will; but the friend- ship ripened, and at Christmas came, addressed to Rosine from her "best friend and schoolmate," an elegant transparent clock of small size, which Captain Marten had brought for his daughter from abroad, and which Rosine had often admired. It was beautiful in itself, though perhaps ill-judged as a gift- to a young girl. The face of the clock was a garnet-colored glass, the figures of golden hue.  It was sustained by the right-hand of a female figure, carved from Egyptian marble, repre- senting Diana, her crescent on her forehead her  54     - - EHawthorndean. bow across her shoulder, her quiver in her left hand filled with arrows, while a hound of exquisite proportions rested at her feet. The pedestal was wrought in arabesque. Behind the face of the clock was a socket for a taper, which, when lighted, showed the hour through the night. Doctor Hart,- land amused himself much over the gift, wondered ;" if Rosine was expected to lie awake and look at it;" thought "Laura had made a mistake;" meant to ask her "if she did not intend it for him-very nice for a doctor's office." Rosine was annoyed by his sarcasm, but delighted with the genuine affec- tion which she felt prompted the gift. She placed the clock directly opposite her bed, bought a quantity of perfumed taperS, and illuminated it nightly. Before February, all the leisure of the two girls was spent in each other's society. They walked together daily, Miss Marten to indulge her penchant-for shopping, and Rosine for her health and the pleasure of Laura's society. Rosine had been carefully guarded by her mother from a "street education," and all these wanderings about town were quite new to her, and no questions being asked as to their walks, she became at length much interested in seeing the clerks and shop-boys tumble over their goods for an exact shade of cloth or riband, which Laura seldom found. They had met one afternoon for their usual round, and were carelessly sauntering along the broad street, when Laura spied a new bright sign on the corner of  Square. "Madame Dorere, Fortune-'lther and Healing ,a       . otUn   City Life.        55  Medium," read Laura as she paused before the door, "just from Paris, will tell the fortune of any person, in the trance state. Madame Dorere also heals diseases by the touch! Come and see for yourselves!" "I do- believe, Rosa," exclaimed Laura as she ended the reading, "this is that wonderful woman Ned Hartland spoke of last night; you know how marvellous he thought her performances. I want to see some one in the trance state. Come, let us go up." "O no," said Rosine, drawing back," don't, please don't."    "Pshaw! why not? You are not afraid, I hope. Why shouldn't we investigate, as well as Rev. Dr. X   or Judge G----?" "But it don't seem right!" pleaded Rosine. "Not right!" replied Laura; "what possible harm can come to us? You need not open your lips while you are there, only go with me, there's a dear," she added coaxingly, "nobody need -be the wiser for our going." I-  Rosine still held back, though Laura had already I  led her to the stairs.  "You might oblige me," said her friend in an injured tone, "by just going up with me. 'I don't ask anything more; if not, I must say 'good by,' for see her I must." Rosine yielded to the superior-will, and was led to an apartment where applicants by dozens were waiting-their turn. She drew down her veil and kept her eyes on the floor, ashamed of her company. Consulting a   56       Hawthorndean,  a fortune-teller! what would her mother think of such- a step-? and how would Sister Agnes and Father Roberts regard it? At length, after long waiting, they were ushered into the room of the oracle. Madame, in long white robes, reclined on a sofa, while over her stood a tall dark man with sharp black eyes filled with cunning. After much ceremony and hocus-pocus mummery, Laura was seafed in front of the sallow, indifferent looking woman, who lay like one dead, while Laura held her limp lifeless hand. Rosine trembled under the eye of the man, who seemed to look her through, as if determined to know her again. Before many minutes, with a struggle and a gasp, the woman spoke in a little whining, whimpering voice, "I see two gentlemen; one of them has very broad shoulders, and carries his head very erect; the other is taller and thinner; he wears a moustache, also a soldier's coat. The first is bold; the last will be, when his time comes. I see an oldish woman; she stares and frowns at a young girl who is looking in the glass opposite. This girl is dark, very brown, with rosy cheeks, and such eyes! She has pluck and plan, and will defeat-yes, she'll outwit the old woman. The girl-is going through the sea-a terrible sea. She is watching a ship--reaching out her arms to it- a man-of-war ship; she has a bright ring on her left hand--but she sinks. O, dreadful!" cried the woman, " she is under the waters; now she rises. O0 there is a monster-a shark! He will have her! don't let-him!" and she screamed convulsively. At, this instant the wretched looking man drew Wi   I City Life.       57 lhis hand rapidly over her face, and quiet returned after a short struggle. Rosine could with diffi- culty restrain her emotions of terror, and even Laura was daunted. She hurriedly slipped a dollar into the man's hand, and was making for the door, when he passed between her and it, saying, "The little Miss will have her's new."- Rosine shuddered, and begged Laura to go. "Don't be chicken-hearted," he said; "those great eyes of yours are not for hothing; they'll break somebody's heart one of these days." i "O, she's only a' child," exclaimed Laura, who    began to be essentially frightened by his familiar manner. "Her turn will- come by and by," he replied, with a coarse smile; "but it is against our rules 'to admit even such as spectators." Laura hastily handed him another dollar, and rushed down stairs, pulling Rosine after her. "We have had enough of fortrun-telling," she said, when they reached the street.' "I do declare that woman 'ade me shiver; and that horrid man! But come, don't look so dolorous; I can't take you home till you look a little more like life," she continued, as she saw Rosine's pale cheek, and felt her trembling arm. They walked many a square before the color came back to her companion's face, or the violent throbbing of her heart, which impeded her progress, was quieted. On their way home they passed Doctor Hartland's office, and Laura insisted upon calling. Rosine drew back, but before she could express her reluctance in words, Laura tapped at the door, and familiarly    58      Hawthorn-dean. opened it, without waiting for a summons. The Doctor received her rather stiffly, rallied Rosine on her very pale face, and advised her to get home as quickly as possible. Even Laura was nonplussed by his behavior. He usually. welcomed her with some joke, and was often urgent for a longer call; she therefore cut short their stay quite unceremo- niously, telling him they would seek more agree- able society. That evening, as Rosine was seated in the library, poring over her German lesson for the next day, visions of the dark-browed saucy man and the frightful woman mingling with the crooked letters, two large hands from behind were laid on her cheeks, and her head drawn gently backward. She gave a slight scream, and a shudder. "You timid little goose," said Doctor Hartland, gazing into her colorless face, "you look as if you had seen a spirit! Has Laura Marten filled your head with ghost stories? Rosa, look out for that girl, be careful where she leads you; don't let her bring you to my office again, it isn't the place for you." The color came back to her cheeks pain- fully as he fixed his eye upon her as if he would read her thoughts. "If you want my advice, you see I give it without asking; if you ask it, I shall give it more freely."' Rosine longed to tell himsher afternoon's experi- ence, but she had not courage. He was evidently waiting for her to speak, as if he knew something and wanted to know more; but at last by way help- ing her, he said, "What do you and Laura find to doevery afternoon?"   City Lzfe.       59 s"! go shopping with her nearly every day, when we take our walks," was the reply. , I "Poor, profitless business, Rosa, for young girls!  Pity Laura Marten had not somebody to keep her at home, if indeed she had any home out of a board- ing-house; but she must not spoil you by gadding. I thought she might do you good by wearing off your blushes, but for boldness like hers, you have neither the air nor the manner. So don't stroll about with her among the clerks and shop-boys; it cannot be improving, and is not half as much for your health as a good brisk walk straight along without stopping." His counsel would have been even more peremp- tory and decided, had he known that in their walks' Laura often met gentlemen, strangers to Rosine, who would turn and walk with them, thus intro- ducing the sister, for whom he began to feel a brother's affection, into questionable society. 't'-  '  '   '           .   CHAPTER VI. CONSCIENCE VS. FRIENDSHP. fi'-cS the days went on, Rosine became dis- I  satisfied with herself, and very uncom- fortable within. She found herself unable to resist Laura's affectionate bewitching  ways, her conscience was ill at ease, the burden of wrong-doing deepened on her heart daily; had her mother been near, she would have gone to her  with her burden. She would perhaps have con-   i fided in Sister Agnes, but she had been called from , town by business for the institution with which she : was connected.   -               : It is at such times that the care and guidance  God has given us in His church should be espe-   cially sought. Rosine knew this, she knew that  : the very dread she had of meeting kind Father . Roberts betokened something wrong. Each new    X step out of the right way would send her to her  i room with a blinding headache, and she began to grow nervous, and tears would come without   l cause.  As she was leaving the church on Ash-Wednes- day, the remembrance of the ashes and their signifi- cation increasing the uneasiness of her conscience, t the sacristan came to her with a request from   i 60 '                  " j   consczence vs. rzensds/ip.    6 Father Roberts that she would come to the sacristy. Trifling as this incident was, it made" her heart beat rapidly, for she knew if her pastor discovered any thing amiss in her, he would not leave the matter till it was searched out to the very end. He had sent for her in answer to a question in a letter received that morning from her mother. Father Roberts was quick and keen-sighted, with the experience of a long life in the study of the heart, and he soon saw that all was not right, when after reading to her the mother's letter, which hoped-all that was good for her dear absent daughter, he inquired after her daily life. Step by step, slowly, but surely, he led Rosine along, till all that trou- bled her in the past was as clearly before him as if he had seen it with his own eyes. He looked very grave and sad. "I thought you were ill, my daughter," he said, "when I saw your pale cheek; but I find the heart is ill at ease, and now I will tell you what you must do," he added, after a pause, "what you must do to set yourself right again. You must give up Laura Marten as an intimate. I am much concerned that this friendship has been permitted to ripen thus far. It will require a struggle, my child, but one which I hope, with the ashes on your brow, and the spirit of the Church's Lent in your heart, you will be ready to make. With your affectionate yielding nature, you will find it difficult to avoid being led where you ought not to go. Miss Marten is wholly unfitted to be your bosom friend." "I love her very much," Rosine struggled to    62      . Hawihorndean. reply; " she is very kind to me,.always doing some- thing for me, has stood by me from the firsti"' she, added, her young heart kindling at the thought'of her early days at school, and this her first girlish friendship. Mr. Roberts shook his head. "I know it is hard," he said, "but it will not do; I see food for sorrow and regret, perhaps life-long, in the con- tinuance of this intimacy. You need not be rude, but the daily hourly communion with her must be withdrawn, if you would have a heart and con- science at peace. By your own acknowledgment, she leads you continually wrong." "It is not her fault that I go," said Rosine, her sense of justice rising to the defence of Laura. "No, certainly," replied the clergyman, "no one is to blame for our sins but we ourselves, but we are very grievously at fault, if we do not forsake places and companions that lead us to doing wrong. All our confessions are invalid, if we do not deter- mine to shun the occasions of sin." Rosine remembered how often Laura had said that her friendship was all she had, and her heart clung closer to her than ever. "Will you not tell me, Rosa," continued her pastor, after a pause, "that you will, for the sake of all that is good and lovely, give up this unfortunate friendship? Believe me, my daughter, it is a pain to me to ask it, but duty tells me I must. Will e you say that it shall be as I wish?" There was a long silence. Mr. Roberts looked- at his watch. "Come, my child, I must claim that promise, or if you will not give it me"--he hesitated ;   Conscience vs. Friendshit.    63 !                         63 --"I cannot give you my blessing, and I shall have a sad -letter to write to your dear mother." "O, please don't write to mother about it," she pleaded, looking up into his face with the tears on her cheek; " if she were here I would tell her all--but so far off, it would distress her unneces- sarily." "Not unnecessarily,- Rosa, if you will not take this step without her. I should be unworthy of her confidence if I left her ignorant of a danger threatening her beloved daughter. She commits you to my care in all her letters, and are you- not committed to my care otherwise? If I could see your young friend, I would explain to her my ideas about the matter very shortly, so that she would exonerate you from any ingratitude; but as that cannot be, you can tell her all 1 have said, and let the blame of giving her up as an intimate rest with me. Will you, my   child?" "I will try," said Rosine, in a voice so low as scarcely to be audible. "That is not enough," he replied gently. "'I will' is the word needed in this case. "ll try/ leaves room for going back." She did not speak.  He looked again at his watch, a rap at the door, which had been repeated for the third time, was heard; he turned away with a grieved countenance and went out. Rosine was more miserable than ever; to go away without her pastor's blessing, there was something dreadful in that thought. He   had often told her duties never clashed, but she was still unwilling to allow that the battle in her soul was a struggle between   654      Hawthorndean., duty and inclination. She resolved upon this-she would tell Laura at once that their afternoon walks must be curtailed, it was Lent, and she must go to some of the Lenten instructions, she would begin that very evening, her afternoons must be taken for study. Laura was not disturbed by this arrange- ment, but offered to come and study with her, and attend service in the evening. During the dinner hour she contrived to arouse the curiosity of Colonel Hartland to go and hear a sensational preacher, in whose wake it was fashionable to follow. He seldom asked Rosine to leave her church, but to-night he was quite urgent that she should go with him to hear the famous Mr. St. John. Rosine's looks told her disappointment, but the Colonel's "only this once to please me," pre- vailed. The Doctor was quite severe in his remarks upon running after preachers, but Laura was not to be moved. She had the Lieutenant all to her- self for the walk, and this was her object. They returned highly disgusted with the whole thing, the Doctor rejoicing over their discomfiture, and renewing his lecture on running after "travelling ministers." "There isn't much danger in your case of being injured by preaching," retorted Laura. "I think I never heard of you at church more than half a day of a Sunday."  "And probably never will, Miss Laura," he replied. "I Ihold religious dissipation to be as bad as any other dissipation; and now I'm speaking of gadding," he added, turning quickly around and *   Conscienee vs. Friendshzip.   65 giving her a look which brought a blush even to her cheek, "I don't approve of it in any way, or in any body, neither in the streets, nor in shops, nor in meeting-houses. Vera pro gratis," he added, bowing to Laura. For some time Dr. Hartland, with his penetra- ting insight into character, had seen that something was troubling Rosine. The Colonel's warm love, that was daily twining itself more and more about his newly found daughter, felt there was a change, less freedom and joyousness of spirits. He con- sulted with Mrs. Hartland as to the cause of this apparent depression, who was sure it was the effect of an imprudent letter from Mrs. Benton, telling Rosine that her little sister Jeannie was growing more feeble under the influence of the western climate, and ending withl the never-ceasing regret she felt for her darling Rosa. Sister Agnes at length returned to hei charge; she had had inquiries from her friend, Mrs. Benton, for her daughter, and one of her first thoughts on reaching the city was for her young friend.' It was necessary to consult the Doctor upon some sani- tary measure with respect to the House, and she would take this opportunity to see Rosine. Their meeting brought back the old spring to the child's heart, it reminded her of her mother, and those best. loved; it brought Father Roberts and his counsel to her mind, and she could not hide her tears as the sister kissed her cheek.. This demon- stration disturbed sister Agnes, and she extracted a promise -from Rosine for a whole day at the House of the Infant Jesus, to talk about her mother.   "       Hawthorndean. - "What is the matter with Rosa?" exclaimed tehf Doctor, when he returned from seeing the good sister into the street, and found Rosine had retired to her own room. "Is she ill?" "I'm sure, Ned, 'I don't know," replied his mother; "I think it is hohmesickness, but your father scouts that idea." "No, mother, it is nonsense to talk of home- sickness at this late day. Why, she has been here four months, and until a few weeks past, months of apparent enjoyment, and' that she should begin to be homesick now is absurd. It may be she is not-well. I have sometimes thought that brilliant color, and very fair skin, might betoken delicacy of constitution. Do question her as to her health. She has too many studies, and too much excite- ment; oratorios, concerts, and, if it were not for Lent, operas and theatres. What benefactors to society, good young lady society especially, were the Fathers who instituted Lent! The Colonel would have killed Rosine with amusements before spring, but for this blessed institution. Do ques- tion her, but don't frighten the child; perhaps I had better speak to her myself." "It is more properly -my place, Ned," replied his mother, "even if she were less frightened by you than me, which I much doubt." "Well, I suppose if it comes to her being really sick, I shall be consulted, so I leave the prelimina- ries with you, only don't delay." Mrs. Hartland, feeling a little uneasiness herself, since the Doctor had suggested that Rosine's health might be at. fault, went immediately to her   Conscience vs. Friendship.   6 room after this conversation, where she found Rosine endeavoring to calm herself after a flood of tears. "My child," said Mrs. 'Hartland, seating herself by her, and speaking as tenderly as her nature would permit, "I am anxious about your health; if you are ill, will you tell me?" "Thank you," replied Rosine, in a timid, tearful voice, "I am not ill, only foolish. I have a head- ache, which will pass off with sleep." But you seem sad," continued Mrs. Hartland; "the Doctor and I are anxious about your health; the Colonel fears you are not happy. I would be glad to do anything to make you contented," she looked at the bright flush that tinged her cheek, and paused. "Pray, Mrs. Hartland," said the young girl, as soon as she could speak, "do not think I am pining for home. I am sure the Colonel and all of you are so kind, I could not be discontented." "Then you must be ill," persisted Mrs. Hartland; now tell me all about it, and if you need medical advice, Ned is here, and you can consult him through me." "No, I  am not ill," reiterated Rosine; "I beg you will not speak to Doctor Hartland of my health. I really am perfectly well," she added, as the lady looked at her doubtingly. "Then what is the difficulty?" said Mrs. Hart- land, relapsing into her usual cold, calm manner. "If you are neither homesick nor unwell, I cannot see the cause of so many tears." The tone and manner threw Rosine back within   68      ]Jawthorndeah. herself. Mrs. Hartland -would not have under- stood her trouble had she opened her grief, indeed she' hardly knew how to name it herself. "It is very strange," said Mrs. Hartland, rising to leave the room, with vexation apparent in her manner, "strange that you are not willing to tell me if there is any serious difficulty; I shall be obliged to make the Doctor his own messenger." Had she seen Rosine's pleading look, she might realized that even such a child might have a sorrow of which she could not speak. The following week came her visit to Sister Agnes. She was carried all over the house to see the new dormitories and pretty rows of children, and the new wing which had been completed during Sister Agnes' absence; finally the good sister took her to the little parlor and talked to her of her mother. She had always, in the absence of her mother, carried her troubles to this friend, and her gentle persuasive tone soon gained the confidence of Rosine, and her perplexities were all made known, even the conversation with Mr. Roberts was related. "And you hesitated to promise, my dear child, and lost good Father Robe/rts' blessing, how could you?" -said the sister.

UNDER THE SEAL OF SECRECY. IN her return home, after the day spent with Sister Agnes, Rosine found the family, except the Colonel, assembled in the library; Mrs. Hartland near her work-table, which stood in the recess of a bay- window, busily employed as usual, her. back half- turned toward the company, but nothing escaping her observation. The Doctor lounged on the couch, book in hand, but was not reading. At the table in the. centre of the room sat Laura Marten, with paper and pencil, before her; the shaded droplight cast its beams upon her face, bringing out the brilliancy of her brunette complexion and the raven blackness of her hair, and kindling bright glances in her lustrous eyes. At her elbow Aleck Hartland was seated, his left hand resting on her chair, while he familiarly looked over her shoulder. The reserved soldier was fast losing his reserve with' Miss Marten. "I wish Rosine were here," said Laura, as the outer door opened to receive her. "O, here she is, the darling!" she exclaimed, springing from her chair, using Lieutenant Hartland's shoulder to assist her in rising,-and rushing to the hall, as she 70   Uinder the Seal of Secrecy.  recognized Rosine's voice, nearly smothering her with kisses.            enh "There, leave kissing her now," said the Doctor, with a yawn, "and let her come and sit here by n1e, while you go  on with the delightful task you hlave undertaken.', Rosine came at his bidding; she, too, was fast losing her timidity with Dr. Hartland. "They are getting up a fair" he said, drawing her towards him, and pointing to Laura and his moether , "and they mean to put you in some- where."             You in some, "O, I hope not," replied Rosine; I never had any part in one in all my life, and should not know whlat to- do." "Never had anything to do with a fair! Poor ignorant heathen! Where have you been all these sixteen years?" said the Doctor, assuming a look of pity. "I thought they were the staple com- modity of you pious people. N  ot acquainted with t!his religious way of picking our pockets? Why, Rosine, you are deficient in first principles!" "M1any Catholcs, as well as Protestants dis- approve of fairs," replied Mrs. Hartland, not look- ing  u p from her work. 'I remem her Father Roberts and Sister Agnes both set their faces cgainst a fair for the 'House of the Infant Jesus,' ery unwisely, certainly, for there is no more suc- essful way of raisin g oney  ."    s- "Father R oberts is a bit of an old fogy, beggin our pardon, Rosa," ch  imed in L aura, "an ag e hind the t  imnes.

Precious scarce Christians must be, by that standard! Fairs he considers very worldly machinery." "They are certainly not religious machinery; said the Doctor, gruffly. "Pious acts of self-denial! Bless me! there is no more piety in them than in tableaux, theatricals, or any other exhibition of pretty things and pretty women!" "Don't, for pity's sake, waste our time discussing their merits secular, or religious," replied Laura; "we are bound to have one, and Mrs. Hartland is to be Major-General, and I am-" "Under orders," whispered Aleck in her ear, bringing the first blush to her cheek that had yet been seen there. '"You are bound to be on her staff," said the Doctor, elevating his eyebrows, as he observed the whisper and the blush. Laura felt the thrust he intended, but did not gratify him by any show of resentment; she commenced an animated discus- sion with Mrs. Hartland about the Hall for the fair, ?the arrangement and distribution of the tables, pass- ing the pencil to the Lieutenant, who according to her statements was making a sketch of the Hall. "The flower table," said Mrs. Hartland, " should be the. rmost prominent object. It ought to be raised above the other tables, and made the most attractive spot. I think, Laura, you would be a nice hand there, because you are not afraid of any- body."   Ulder the Seal of Secrecy.    73 "Flattering!" whispered Laura to the Lieuten- ant. "Thank you, Mrs. Hartland," she said aloud; "I think my black face would be too obvious in so conspicuous a place, unless you will let me have Rosa's fairness by way of contrast as my assistant." "A very pretty idea!" exclaimed Mrs. Hartland, "put it down at once." "Don't parcel off Rosine without her consent," cried the Doctor from the sofa, where he and the young girl still retained their seats. "I doubt if the Colonel would be pleased to see his daughter 'the observed of all observers,' beside Laura Marten too, in so public a position." The Lieutenant turned quickly about, and shot an angry look toward his brother, but Laura good naturedly took no notice of the intended imperti- nence. "How foolish, Ned, for you to put such notions into Rosine's head," replied Mrs.,Hartland. "She will be only one of scores of girls of far greater pretensions than she. It will give her ease and self- possession; why, when I was sixteen, I presided at the dinner-table-for a large company of gentlemen. I heard the Colonel, only yesterday declare his pleasure that her shyness was wearing off." Rosine blushed painfully at these personal obser- vations, and Ned remarked that blushes were very becoming, if she would only confine herself to blushing in the right time and place.  Laura kept up her chatting with Mrs. Hartland, and her tender glances and speeches to the Lieu- tenant, till the rain, which had been threatening all the evening, poured in torrents, and she was obliged l    - flawthtornaean.  74 to remain for the night. Fascinating ancrexciting, p even to plain, stiff Mrs. Hartland, were her brusque ' manners, and piquant talk, in spite of the occa- i sional sense of being shocked by something not - quite lady-like.- As soon as the door closed upon i the young girls, when they were retired for the night, Laura threw her arms about Rosine, using towards -her the most endearing epithets. "Come , sit here," she said, drawing her friend toward  i an ancient arm-chair, large enough for a modern family; "I'm nearly bursting with a secret I have to tell' you-a great secret. I have perfect con- j fidence in your honor and friendship. I am engaged-to marry Lieutenant Hartland." Rosine was perfectly confounded by this an- nouncement-made, too, under the bond of secrecy. "Why must this be a secret?" she said, when she had a little recovered from her first astonish- ment. "Isn't any one to know it but me?" "Not at present," Laura replied. "My father is abroad, and I should like his consent before we make it public." "But the Colonel, and Mrs. Hartland?" suggested Rosine. "Aleck is to be ordered to the South Seas; he wants to marry at once, but that is out of the question; and on the whole, why should we selfishy disturb the old lady (begging her pardon,) till he comes back. We can enjoy ourselves without harmingr any one, and Mrs. Hartland decidedly objects to her'boys' falling in love with anybody but -herself."  "Strange!" said Rosine, overwhelmed by her   Under the Seal o Secrecy.   75* volubility. "I'm sorry you have told me--not that I shall tell; but if they should ask, I should surely betray myself. I could not help showing that I knew something,* even if I did not speak. I'm so sorry you told me such a dreadful secret." "' Why, you foolish child," said her companion, laughing at her innocence, "there is no danger that they will ask you; they do not suspect any- thing, unless, perhaps Ned may, but he considers me too rattle-brained to be serious about the most important matters." She then related to Rosine her new experience, told her plans with apparent truthfulness, and with all the confidence of girlish friendship. It is not strange that the young girl was flattered by this mark of her love, even while the secret burned in her bosom. Laura had pro- posed for the furtherance of her plans, to spend the short time that remained before the Lieutenant sailed, at the house of her -Aunt, a widow, who owned a fine estate, a day's ride from the city. It was natural that the first bit of romance in her d life should interest Rosine, and to be made the sole confidante of a pair of young lovers, was very flattering, and Laura assured her it was Aleck's wish that she should know of the engagement. Rosine retired to her own apartment with con- tending emotions struggling within her heart.- She felt that she was more than ever intimately con- nected with her, friend in spite of her resolutions; the- remembrance of her promise to 'try,' which had not satisfied Father Roberts, marred the plea- sure- she would otherwise have had in her friend's happiness; and then the dreadful secret-! It made   76       Hawthorndean. sad inroads into her hours of sleep. In a few days Laura came with what purported to be a summons from her Aunt. Mrs. Hartland remon- strated because of the fair; the Doctor rejoiced because of Rosine. She lent herself to the decep- tion only by her silence, but she could not resist the feeling that she was party to some wrong- doing, connected as Laura s departure was with the secret imposed upon her friend. The knowledge of the clandestine engagement was a continual thorn to Rosine, bringing the stinging blush to her cheek whenever, during Laura's absence, she felt the Lieutenant's gaze fixed upon her. That gentle- man was, however, little at home during these days, pleading business at the Navy Yard, in preparation for his departure, as a reason for his absence. In about two weeks Laura returned. The X--, the man-of-war of which Aleck Hartland was First Lieutenant, was to sail in three days. The young lovers met .often during these days, and Laura, to avoid suspicion, was induced to spend one evening at Colonel Hartland's. It was at the close of this evening, wherein, emboldened by the absence of his mother and the Colonel, and the apparent occupation of the Doctor with Rosine over a diffi- cult translation, Aleck had manifested more lover like attentions than usual toward Laura, that Dr. Hartland took his brother seriously to task. "Aleck," he said; after Laura had gone away and Rosine had retired for the night, "do you mean to marry Laura Marten at some future day? Your attentions are certainly most devoted." "No, I do not mean to marry Laura Marten at   Under the Seal of Secrecy.    " some future day," replied the Lieutenant, repeating the tone and words of his brother. "Then you are acting the part of a scoundrel. Don't you see the girl is up to her eyes in love with you? and you encourage her fondness." At the word "scoundrel," the quick blood mounted into the fair forehead of the Lieutenant, and he started from his seat; but in a moment a smile passed over his face, and he was again seated,  quietly replying, "It is not for a long time, Ned. I'm going off soon, and Laura's heart wont break with a week's courting." "That's true," replied the Doctor more calmly,- as if sorry for his harshness; "in most cases, I would not see this going on a day longer, but there isn't much danger of Laura; this fashionable flirtation, which she understands to perfection, is most abomi- nable in man or woman, hardening the heart like lying or stealing, or any of the mortal sins. I know it is tough, Aleck, when a woman woos as hard as Laura does you-but, if you are all right, I don't know as '1 concern myself about her." "O. K.," replied the brother, with the same smile. The partings were said, and the ship had weighed her anchor. Laura again sought Rosine as the repository of her griefs and joys. The plain gold ring on her finger she pointed out as the pledge of their betrothal, and as days went by she recovered her spirits, growing more and more silent about the departed. Presently she was wholly absorbed in the approaching fair, to which so many had given their whole time for the winter, and Mrs. Hartland and Laura were in consultation continually. 7*   ; CHAPTER VIII. WESTWARD, HO! WE left our; friend, Mrs. Benton, full of anxiety for her sick boy, without any one of her own sex to sympathize or help, except her daughter; indeed, it was eight weeks after her arrival on the prairie before she met a woman, neighbor Rice being the only one who called, except on farming business. The people of the region, especially the Yankee portion of the inhabitants, had taken a fancy that Mr. Ben- ton was proud and rich--two of the poorest recom- mendations in a new country-and Mrs. Benton was supposed to partake of the same qualities. Kind-hearted women there were, but they kept aloof, lest Mrs. Benton should not: welcome their advances. This state of things was broken into by Rice, after his visit to Harold. There was an assembled crowd of three men and seven boys in the Athlacca post-office, when Rice declared that, "That Missus Benton was just the slickest kind of a woman; such a down-hearted thing too; not a bit crank or set up. To be left on that big prairp with that sick boy, and a puny two-year-old that looked as if she would drop to pieces, and nobody 78   XWestward, Ho       79 but that pootty gal that didn't know how to do nothin, to lift a finger; it was hard, he reckoned." Horatio Leighton, the youngest of the listen- ing men, reported the testimony of Mr. Rice to his mother, a kind, large-hearted' New England woman, and forthwith mother and son rode over to the prairie farm, to proffer assistance and neigh- borly sympathy.  Mrs. Leighton was the lady of the village, and her example was soon followed by Athlacca society generally. Mrs. Benton thus had an opportunity to propose the Sunday-school for those for whom it was "intended. Much to the surprise of Mrs. Benton, Mr. Leighton kindly offered to provide a roomt for the meetings of the children, and to assist in bringing them together, so that matters were started quite prosperously, and it did them all good; particularly did the exertion arouse Marion from the morbid state of dissatisfaction into which she was settling. Mr. Benton could never be- persuaded to leave his home, or cross a neighbor's threshold. He said he was like Cain, branded with an ineffaceable stain, and his wife ceased to urge him, when she saw every new effort only aroused the bitterness of remorse that still rankled in his bosom; but Mrs. Benton responded to the offered friendship of her neighbors, as well as she could with her poor aching heart, for the sake of her children. She found the Leighton family quite companionable. Mrs. Leighton was one to be loved and respected; the possessor of vast energy and physical strength, - she had left the east six years- before, a widow with five children dependent upon her labors in the   80 awthorndean. main for their support. She could have struggled on in hopeless poverty and dependence at the east, but this was contrary to her nature. opened a vast field of progress t o her daugh- boys; she only hesitated on account of her daugh- ter, who had been crippled by one of the unor-  tunate accidents of infancy. Horatio was a well- grown lad at the death of his father, and h rged the removal promising always to care for his sister. He inherited his mother's progressive qualities, and was eager for broader field than his native city opened tohim. Their ti-oice had fallen upon Athlacca,    throu a friendly neighbor who owned large unfenced tr acts i t hat region, and who prophesied great things of the glory and renown of the county town that was to be. Young Leighton had prospered, as anu trius, ambitious, capable, healthy young men must prosper in a new countryhe cd rt his place as attorney in the a   courts, lawyer of the village, besides owning and cultivating a large tract of land; his name; too, had been pro- posedasreprentative to the state legislature; in short, he     a  popular.

The proposition of the   Westward, Ho       81 8 . Sunday-school, although he was of no creed, and called himself a Protestant, coming as it did from Mrs. Benton, he Seconded with all his energy. Churches and schools he knew attracted the better. class of emigrants, therefore he lent to the proposal the weight of his influence, and sometimes his presence. Spring had come, welcome spring! How wel- come to the heart of Mrs. Benton after the dreary blackness and desolation of the winter! The grass began to shoot up all over the blackened surface of the prairie, and bright flowers appeared, but she listened in vain for the chirping of the robin; the scene was too desolate for his social, humanity loving nature. Harold's neck still galled under the yoke of incessant farm labor, and although Mr. Benton was more lenient and forbearing with his son, occasionally there would come a. frown or a threat, that cut like a dagger4thrust The m-other comforted her boy by promise of exertion on his behalf as soon as the way could be made clear. 'Her thoughts often turned to sister Agnes' sugges- tion respecting good Father Cote, who was in'St. Louis; she would have ventured to address himi but her husband would not consent that she should beg a situation for Harold. If she could go to St. Louis and see the priest, he would have no objec- tions to placing Harold in his care in any honor- able employment where he might earn his bread.* There seemed little prospect of this, but Mrs. Ben- ton hoped and prayed on. i  Marion had made the acquaintance of Mrs. Leighton's invalid daughter, a girl about her own-   8o2      Hawthordeasn. age, but in a measure helpless. The intimacy on Marion's part was violent and absorbing, no home , ,duties must prevent her almost daily ride to poor Alice. Mrs. Benton was glad to see her daughter's interest drawn' out of herself, but she was not altogether pleased to have her so absorbed with a stranger, to the neglect of her home cares, and especially the love and care of her little sister. When reasoned with upon the matter, Marion behaved like a martyr who had been thwarted by some superior force in the performance of religious duty. Her visits to Alice Leighton she put down- among her meritorious works of self-denial, whereas the ride on horseback across the unbroken lawn, the exhilarating breezes of spring-time, the motherly embrace ofMrs. Leighton, and the glad smile of the invalid, were of themselves pleasures, to be sought moderately, but not to the neglect of first claims. Mrs. Benton dreaded the moping ways of the early winter, and she hoped time, experience, and conscience might teach her the right, without too much interference on her part. Her father ques- tioned in his own mind the propriety of Marion's course, but he had never thwarted her, and he felt it too late to begin. She returned one night with a message from Mr. Leighton to her mother; he was to start in two days on a business expedition to St. Louis. He had heard Mrs. Benton often express a wish to go to that city, and he would be happy to escort herself and Miss Marion thither. After some scruples on the part of Mr. Benton, he gave his consent for the journey, except that Harold should go in the place 'of his sister.   -WestwaZrd, Hio!     83 This was a terrible trial to Marion; she had antici- pated so much pleasure in the jaunt, and unused to being denied anything, she betrayed by her pouting and dissatisfied countenance the inward workings of her rebellious spirit.- She did not fully appre- ciate her father's objections, but she knew that her feeble little sister was not in a condition to be left wholly  to the care of her father and brother. Her mother observed the vexation, but made no comments upon. her ill-humor, only reiterating her charges about Jeannie. The journey was very delightful to Mrs. Ben- ton; it would have been almost unalloyed pleasure, but for anxiety for the little one left to the care of her reluctant sister. The relief to the eye and to the heart, from the unbroken surface of the prairie to the sheltering arms of the broad oaks and walnuts, the sharp bluffs and rich bottom lands through which their route lay, can only be appre- ciated by those who have dwelt: for months where no tree rears its green head, nor hill nor dale diver- sifies the monotonous scene. Young Leighton was an agreeable and entertaining companion, but though occupied with other thoughts, Mrs. Benton could not but observe how often the young man's conversation was connected with "Miss Marion," and a new cause of solicitude was given to her meditations. Our party reached St. Louis the third day, just as the sun was setting; the weather was mild and the season advancing in all the luxuriance of a western spring. At the time of which we yrite the Catholic Church was almost unknown nthe tl ant ,  -   84       Hawzthorndea:n.      ! United States out 'of our large cities. St. Louis, ^however, from its early settlement has ever been a paradise for Catholics, abounding in churches, Religious Houses, and all those precious accom- paniinents which the Church, our Holy Mother, brings-in her wake. Mrs. Benton readily found good Father Cote, and was received with all that outgushing hospitality and warmtl for which he was ever famous. "Did he remember her?"When did- he forget any one, especially one who had aided him with his orphan charge in those dreary cholera times, when help was most needed. With delight he showed her the result of his years of labor, in a splendid church, and a spacious and well arranged Orpllan Asylum under the care of Reli- geuse. Mrs. Benton playfully asked him if he had yet found the gold mine. "Long ago," he replied; "I have worked that many years; it lies in pious, prayerful hearts." Mrs. Benton opened her whole mind to the worthy priest, it was a welcome relief to her weary soul; his counsel cheered her, made ller brave and strong again, and his hearty sym- pathy in the case-of Harold gave -her new faith to pray. He bade heri leave the boy with him, or send him on in a few weeks, he could find some- tlhing'for him to do in that large city. He was delighted with her son, and when he laid his hand on' his head and gave him his blessing, Mrs. Benton felt that her fervent prayer had been answered, the good God had given her boy a friend. Her heart was lightened of a heavy load as she turned homeward. When she reached her humble   West/ward, Ho!      85 dwelling, she was grieved, we cannot say she, was entirely surprised, to find her dear little Jeannie quite ill from excessive weeping, and her husband incensed with Marion because she had no power to soothe her suffering sister. Marion, trembling under her father's displeasure, and really anxious for her sister, was rejoiced to see her mother's welcome face. "Why couldn't I quiet Jeannie?" she inquired, when the sick child had at length been hushed to sleep by the mother, the first sound sleep since her departure. "' I'm sure I tried every way to still her, but father took her away from me, and had to walk the room with her most of the nights; indeed, she screamed whenever I .came. near her." "I can tell you, my. daughter," replied Mrs. Benton, with a grieved countenance, "if you wish to know why this is so; you have never sought to win the child to you; you have gone away from your sister to seek strangers, or your own selfish retirement, and Jeannie is afraid of you." "But papa accused me of cruelty to her, and bade me not. to come near her till your return. I think it was ill-tempered in Jeannie to refuse all my  efforts to comfort her, and very unkind in ppaa-." The look on her mother's face caused her. to leave the sentence unfinished. "My daughter, how long is it since you learned to call in question your father's conduct? Had you done simply-your duty by Jeannie these months past, you might have won her love, and would not have found her 'ill-tempered,' but a nervous, sensitive, sick child. Harold- has often done ser- a '   vices for her which were the province of a sister.: I am. disappointed in you, Marion. I had a right to expect help, not hinderance, not simply the cold services of the hand,- but the warm sympathies of the heart, in- my trials." At .this moment Mr. Benton entered the room. Marion;shrunk --into a corner, but her -mother con- tinued: "'Indeed, my child, selfishness increases upon -pyou, (and you often forget that there are any claims superior to your own present gratifica- tion. Jeannie's love is not hard to win." "Lucy,'" said Mr. Benton, looking at Marion  almost fiercely, " Jeannie is terrified at the sight of; her sister. I cannot account for it, except by per- sonal ill treatment." Marion burst into tears at her father's accusa-   tion. - "O, Philip, dear," exclaimed Mrs. Benton, "not so bad as that!" -"She would not be guilty of positive unkind- ness, it is sitmply neglect, sometimes almost total. Jeanriie's exceedingly sensitive nature shrinks from strangers, and Marion is almost a stranger to her." The- frown grew  even darker on Mr. Benton's brow, as he said in a stern voice, turning to his daughter: "Until you can learn your duties at home, you are not fitted to be trusted abroad. I shall sell your pony at once," ty-Wait a-little, my dear husband," said the medi- ating-voice of the-wife; "try Marion again; she would be the last to forgive herself, if Jeannie were to! :be- taken from her, so estranged."  -"Q'0, dea mamma," exclaimed Marion, falling ofn 'O -deaf, mani   n  ft#    Westlward, Ho!       87 her 'knees by her mother, "don't talk of that, I could not bear it."  But we must all look at it as among -the proba. bilities. Her tender constitution cannot long en- dure this climate,.we have only to make her few, days as happy as we can; perhaps I have been wrong," added Mrs. Benton, "in not leaving the child. more to Marion; it has been a pleasure to keep her near myself, knowing how soon I must resign her.' The delinquent daughter could bear it no longer, her pride succumbed, she confessed her selfish- ness, ::only begging that her father would not :think she had been cruel. "When you win her love, Marion," he said, a little of his usual tenderness toward her creeping into his tone, s"Ishall believe you; tillfthen/you need some power to curb your inordinate self seeking.  I will take care of the, pony; the--rides to the village must be curtailed till I see some amendment"        . Marion retired to her room, feeling the weight of her father's Severity, but she could .not but acknowledge to herself that there was justicein it "It is all my  fault," said Mr. Benton, as hi s daughter went out; "my own  youthful  folles 'eproduced-pride and selfishness.

"You 'are. doing, Philip,' said the 'sweet, con- soling voice of his wife, softened by unshed tears, "youl are daily doing all that you can for them.

O,' she added, placing her hand upon his head, which rested on the table where he had bowed it almost in- despair, "I was never; in all:the last years of our life in town, so happy as now;- you are restored to me, free from those terrible business cares, and the entanglements of trade-" ' "But to bring, you here," he said, interrupting her; "you, who have never- before known any thing but-plenty and friends, to this poverty and solitude!"  "Poverty .and solitude are better with you, dearest, than wealth and friends without." The -sincerity of Philip Benton's repentance -was manifeted, in his daily struggles with pride, and his .natural :aversion to manual labor; and the Christian example of his wife, in her terrible trials, had, begun its work upon his heart; and-when the day of Harold's departure came, a marked change of feelinghad taken place, and they parted with rial sorrow.   Westward, Ho!       89 Little Jeannie grew daily more feeble. The wasting disease that had found a hiding-place in her delicate frame developed itself, and Marion saw in the distance the plain fulfilment of her mother's words. She would have been cruel indeed, if the sight of this gradual decay had not led: her to exert herself for the little sufferer. For many weeks the averted face and faint moan, when she came near, gave her a most distressing heartache, but when at last the child was persuaded, in the absence of her .mother, to nestle in Marion's lap, and lay her head on her bosom, the look ,she received from  her father brought a sensation of relief, such as she had not felt for a long time. A The  busy wheat harvest approached with its scorching sun and troops of laborers. Mr. Benton already worked each day beyond his strength. His sheep, of which he had collected a -fine flock from   different farms within a range of twenty miles, troubled him :by straying back to-their old homes, and journey after journey was taken for the sheep in the wilderness, sometimes to find they had been the prey of wolves that infested that region. One morning they were all missing, and he mounted his horse, and with Turk, who had become   his inseparable companion and pet since Harold's departure, went forth to search for them. It was a  very hot morning in July, and as he came near his home he missed the dog.  He gave itnm- self no uneasiness, thinking he would, rdurnat his leisure, but poor Turk never came -bhk; -the scarcity of water in those vast unwatered- fields was his death; the hungry wolves fed on his careass.   -.'o      iYawthorndean. Mrs. Benton was almost -overwhelmed by the increase of cares consequent on the influx of farm- help- during wheat harvest, not only the absolute labor troubled her, but the contempt with which they looked upon her:eastern cookery was an annoyance. They would as soon eat young kittens as, veal, and as to sheep-meat, that must not come into their bill of fare. They compared the light white delicate, compound she called bread, with their own carbonated biscuit, and felt only scorn for her performances. Here Mrs. Leighton came in with -her motherly ways and experience, and not only initiated Mrs. Benton into the secrets of western "good living," -but-found an assistant for her, a luxury almost unknown at that time on the prairies of Illinois. The "help" made her appear- ance under the escort of young Leighton; she leaped from the wagon and ran around the corner of the. house when Mrs. Benton appeared at the door. Horatio Leighton captured her, and brought her before her new mistress. She was a girl of thir- teen-perhaps, her black hair was cropped all over her head, and stood erect, innocent of brush or comb; her face and arms were swarthy as lan Indian's; she stood with her finger in her mouth, and-hung her head when addressed, but there was a glance from the corner of her hawk's eye, as if she meditated an escape the first opportunity. "What is your name?" inquired Mrs. Benton. "Sqbriety Top, mum," was the reply. ",Have :yu parents?" asked- the mistress. "Dono what 'em is," said the girl, in a sharp quick- voice;   Weszwarrd, Ho!     9/ "Have you a father and mother?" continued Mrs. Benton. "Pap and mam's dead," replied the girl, with perfect indifference. Mrs. Benton was shocked with this reply, which young Leighton perceiving, he left Marion, with whom he had been chatting, to relate to her mother the past history of the child. He explained that she had never known her parents, had been raised in Indiana, and brought to Athlacca by her uncle. She had been made to work in the fields, and treated in so severe a manner that the neighbors had interfered, and the town authorities had taken her under their care; "she is very near a heathen, I fear," said Mr. Leighton, in' closing, "but if you can make anything of her, it will surely be mis- sionary'work; she is right strong and healthy, and those who know her' say she is not vicious." At the commencement of his narrative, Sobriety had escaped to the " outside," as she called it, and as he rose to go, Marion accidentally looked out of the window, near which he had been standing, and Ithere, squatted on the ground with her swarthy face turned upward, was the girl, listening with interest to her biography. After some hesitancy Mrs. Benton determined to make a trial 'of her, and a letter written about this time will tell us how she prospered in this as well as in other matters. "PRAIRIE HoIS, Julg, 184 l-. "MY BELOVED SISTER AGNES:I "It is long since I have written you freely; my time has been so filled with household cares, and   92      Htawthorndean. the tending of little Jeannie, that I have only been able to keep Rosine and Willie informed of our welfare. We have all worked very hard for the last few weeks, giving up every thing for the waiting on farm-help. My husband exerts himself daily-beyond his strength. We all work to disad- vantage, from our ignorance of farm labor. For myself, I have just now a little more leisure; Jean- nie's disease having assumed a quiet form, she sleeps much, and is spared, that dreadful nervous- ness that has hitherto been her greatest suffering. We were obliged to seek 'help.' I wish I could show you 'Sobriety Top,' our assistant. No case of ignorance I ever have met can compare with her utter want of any idea of God, having never heard-his name, except in oaths. I can realize a little what I never did before, the labor our blessed Apostles to the Indies must have had in reaching the heathen mind. She is bright and intelligent, and now that IL have bleached the outside by a kew weeks' in-door labor, she is not bad-looking, She has been reared to follow the laborers in the held,: and of her manners and morals you can judge. Had Harold or Willie been at home, I should have declined taking her. Mr. Benton has a perfect antipathy to her; you know how sensitive he is to anything unwomanly in the sex; but-:I feel encouraged to hope, now she begins to understand kindness, that this mind may be snatched from worse .than Pagan darkness. Marion has undertaken to' teachbher to read, the discipline which such an effort will require will .be good for the teacher. Marion is doing better, I am most z -* I    Westward, -o-       93 happy to say; one or two severe reprimands from her father having had the effect to arouse her to a sense of her duties. Harold is doing well; I may write you what Father Cote says of him, 'He is a noble boy, and does credit to his home-training.' He is to learn civil engineering, to which he strongly inclines. My heart yearns for my absent ones; dear Willie sends me messages of love in his grandfather's letters. His eyes are very trouble- some.- I fear the disease may be permanent. I may say to you what I can say to no other-iny dear husband is more fully all I could wish, day by day. His self-abnegation and deep penitence prove, I am sure, that however his fellow-man may regard him, his Father in Heaven will forgive him. "We have as yet no priest, -though I heard a rumor that we were soon to have that blessing. We shall all be more peaceful and contented when we can go to our religious duties. The Sunday- school flourishes under the care of a young physi- cian, lately come to this village, though I have been wholly unable to attend to it of late. Marion con- tinues her interest, and has managed to interest some who are not of our faith in its prosperity. But dear sister, such a longing for the Blessed Sacrifice comes over me at times, that I fear my own comfort, more than the glory of God, moves me. But I hear dear Jeannie's feeble wail, and I must close my letter; thanks that you do not always wait for a reply to your comforting mes- sages of love. Write often, and never forget to pray for your friend and sister,  LUCY."   CHAPTER IX. THE PRAIRIE IN A FOG. IT was in the month of August that the first experience of a fog on the grand prairie was given to Mr. Benton and his family. A scorching sun, and a sweep- ing simoom wind heated like the breath of a furnace, had wilted every living thing, and the dense fog that followed was a relief to man and beast. It was so dense that one could penetrate its depths only for a few feet. Marion, equipped for a ride, with pony saddled and bridled, appeared at the door; the injunction had ,been removed.  "Across the prairie to-day, my daughter?" said the father, who had just then come from the sheep- fold; "there is danger in these fogs, people have been lost--no plain track, nothing but cattle trails from here :to the village to guide you-I would rather you should not go." The tone and manner were too decided for Marion to think of resistance, although her coun- tenance fell, and she went into the house. Horatio Leighton had fixed this day for her to meet his mother and sister, who had offered to assist her in making clothes' for the poorer Sunday-school "   The Prazie in a Fog. 9, scholars, and now she' must give it up, just for a foolish fear of her father's. He heard the sullen discontented murmur as she closed.'the :door, and saw the unamiable manner in which she threw her ridiing-hat from her. Marion looked up and beheld in the mirror before her the mischievous sparkle of Miss Sobriety's coal-black eyes, which were taking note of what passed. -Marion impatiently ordered her to come to -her lessons. "It's right hard, Miss," said Sobriety, as they' disappeared in the inner room; "the old -man', so sot. Rashe Leighton will be worked up I reckon; he's powerful bent-on your comin;yoiur pap's a mean un." "Hush!" .said her teacher, mortified that-she had! brought this upon herself by her cross looks. "It is very wicked for. you to speak so about my papa. and very improper for you to call Mr. Leighton by his- Christian - name." "Waal," replied the girl, drawling out her words one by one, "I ain't a bit like you. I lets out what you keeps in." "Attend 'to your book," said Marion sharply, coloring with vexation. Sobriety mhade some characteristic reply, till her teacher, becoming vexed beyond measure at the impertinence of the girl, and annoyed by her insight into character, threw aways the book, and left her to herself. Ill at ease, disturbed by her disappointment, and annoyed by her own conscience, she was wholly u unfitteds to meet little Jeannie, .who turned away her head and moaned when she approached. Mr. On  .   96     a  tawthorndean. Benton rebuked her- sharply for her ungracious manner, which excited her anger to such a degree that,she left the room with impertinent haste and noise. "Lucy," said her father as she went out, "it is but lately I have begun to know my children. I thought Marion an uncommonly well behaved girl; this unwillingness to be crossed in the most trivial thing, seems .like a. new trait sprung up like a serpent in: my path, as a direct inheritance from me. Business men make a grievous, mistake in never knowing anything of their children, except that they are always well fed and clothed, go to school regularly, and behave with propriety the very few. minutes they, are suffered to be in their presence. I pity Marion, I know she is solitary; and perhaps it would have been better for me to have given her this day's pleasure at a little risk." "Do you think there would be real danger in an attempt to reach the village?" inquired his wife; - or was there. some other motive that led you to forbid the ride?" "Did you suspect me of any other motive, Lucy?" "Not suspect," she replied, "but I thought you might have reasons of which you did not wish to speak." "Do -you- refer-.to young. Leighton?" inquired Mr. Benton. "I really had not him in my thoughts when I ordered Marion's pony back to the stable, but If would rather there were a little less intercourse. Marion is young, and as you see, incapable of self-control, and two young people  ,   Th -ie Prairee in a' Fog.   97 thrown together so constantly, without other con- genial companions, often become entangled before they know it. Young Leighton is well enough for his- position--but-what right have I to speak?" he added, his countenance flushing crimson, the flush succeeded by a deadly paleness. "He is at least honest." Mrs. Benton suppressed the wish to say'some- thing soothing to her husband; preferring to con- tinue the subject of her daughter, she replied: "Marion has never been in gentlemen's society; I think she has very little thought on the subject." "Yet she is nearly as old as you were, Lucy, when our engagement was made. I should regret the encouragement of anything of this kind; before seeing more of the world than she is like to see here." "I do not fear for her in the case of Mr. Leigh- ton," replied the wife. "She is very ambitious; I fear her affections will never lead in such a matter. The Leightons seem to be the only family with whom   she can enjoy social intercourse, and it would be hard to debar her from their acquaint- ance from :mere suspicion of such a result as we have contemplated. Her desire to go to the village to-day arose, I am  sure, from a good motive, her interest in the Sunday-school; but as you say, this reluctance to be thwarted, her unwil- lingness to be guided, is a most unchristian trait, and one which I have. battled against in her since she was a child." "And which she takes direct from me, Lucy. God sends us our sharpest cross in obliging us to 9     ... 98    :. aawtazorndean. , puish in-our children faults which we cannot but see are a-plain inheritance from ourselves. I must , humble my proud heart to tell Marion the origin of these miserable blots on her character, and the dreadful curse they have been to me," "'I think the fog is breaking up," said Mrs. Benton, going to the window, desiring to prevent a morbid recurrence to the past; "it looks brighter. - Don't you think Marion might ride to the village min, the morning?" "Possibly," replied her husband, "if she is in better mood to-morrow.- Albus will carry her safely to Athlacca; he is sure-footed, and is cer- tainly accustomed to the way." Marion's- solitary day benefited her, for she was ashamed, -and afraid to appear with the family. Her conscience had opportunity to work, and was very busy; heY pride, too, had been sorely wounded by :thie thought that she had not been able to govern herself, and needed the discipline, of a child. To have made such a display of temper before Sobriety, whom she was continually lecturing on 'good behavior, as -to have caused her father to rebuke -her sternly, was galling to her nature. A little, book, given her by Father Roberts the morning of her Confirmation, lay on her dressing- table iahd she opened it at this marked passage- marked, as -she thought to herself, when it was easy to 'e good-"Art thou very sure thou knowest what' it is indeed, and in truth to :bear My Cross? r tor-ere are -many on earth who call themselves Mty disciples, and profess to carry it within their aqrms; but. the token which they wear, although c. ,.'2." ...;. ....., -0    The Prairie in a Fbg.  it hath the shape and. form ofa 'cross, is butt a mockery of the stern reality. It gives no pain- nor weariness, it hath no goading sharpness, tarocsing them: to labor as I labored; it hath no piercing power to cut into their very souls, and drag:their pride and self-will from their concealed depths before theirweeping eyes, nor crushing weight to lay them in the dust of penitence." - Where was the cross, she asked herself, Wthich she had taken up joyfully-even willingly? She had chafed and rebelled, and trampled on the cross which she should have borne gladly for the sake of her dear Lord.            : - The fog was perhaps a shade less dense' the following morning, and Mr. Benton's heart -was moved  by the deep blush which suffused his daughter's face, as she said to him, "Papa, I am sorry; will you kiss me?" He knew something of the- effort those words must -have cost, and kissing her affectionately, he whispered a word in her ear, that made  the blush deepen and spread, and brought tears into her eyes. "Do you think you may venture, my child?" he said aloud, bringing her towards the outer'door. "The fog is still impenetrable, but Albus knows the way; only keep a, tight rein." "Perhaps I had better not,"' -she said, resting her head on his shoulder and now really weeping; "I can't be trusted."'    ;' "You can't trust yourself?" he replied quickly, and sitting down with her under the stoop he6 had erected before the door, he said most aiffectonatiely but gravely, "I have a great deal to sayt to you,   tioo   .  'Hawthorndean.

Pride, ambi- tion, unwillingness to be thwarted, have ruined my life; let not my child follow in these false steps of her father, but time wears away, I will bring the- pony if you wish it." : Marion went to prepare herself; she had no fear of the fog, but she felt that her father's wish, which she saw, though he did not express it, ought to goveern"her; but then there was poor Alice Leigh- ton whom she had not seen for nearly a week. 'Dear -reature, so little variety as she has in life, and so confined, I think I really should go"-she said to herself. "He gave me his permission too. How thankful I am for my strength, and health," she :added aloud as she shook down the folds of her riding-dress, and arranged the long feather in het hat'- Sobriety stood at her elbow as she ttirnned. The tiresome girl! How much had she Hleard' ::f the soliloquy? , ' How pooty we am .!" said the intruder, grinning frotiear to"ea to ear, and snapping her coal-black eyes mischievousy.- I S he really said you might! ,Wail,:I reckon you'll come home piert enough."   The Prairie in a Fog.    I0 I Marion condescended no reply, but went to kiss her mother before her departure. "You are willing, mamma?" she questioned. "Certainly, if your father thinks there is no danger; return in good season, my child." Mr. Benton held the bridle of the pony while Marion mounted. "Come home before night," he said, looking at-his watch; "make a start by five.; -certainly, that will bring you home an hour before sunset, don't disappoint us." "I will remember," she replied, slowly taking up the reins. She had half a mind to give up the pleasure, when she saw in her father's anxious face a prognostication of evil, but her self-will and pride of opinion again conquered, and the pony left the door on a brisk trot. She reached Mrs. Leighton's hospitable roof in the timber in safety, both Alice and her mother welcoming her with a surprised embrace. "How did she dare cross the prairie in such a fog? People were lost sometimes, and wan- dered about for days. Horatio himself had been out only the last summer with a party of hunters, and they were lost for three days, had to be put on short allowance, and found themselves the third day within a quarter of a mile of their starting point they having travelled in a circle." These reminiscences were not specially comfort- ing to Marion, and they would intrude even upon the pleasures of the day. Young  Leighton was engaged in a trial then pending at the court-house, and did not make his appearance at the cottage. Alice was rejoicing in a wheel-chair, the gift of her; brother, ordered from the east without her know/ 9*  -  *    1-02      fawthorndean. ledge. She was constantly drawing Marion's atten- tion to -this kind thought of her brother, as she wheeled herself -about in it from room to room. "You will be better- now, dear Alice," said her friend; "'if this fog would but lift, I could wheel :you about among the trees." "' am a heap better," said the delicate invalid, shading her blue eyes as if the sun shone out, "already better; I think now I can get about, I shall be right smart.. Horatio says it is your sweet company that has made me better; and last night, O! I wish you could have heard his powerful lec- ture on manners; it was worthy of, a judge. He told me I had learned to talk like a 'sucker;' to say :a heap better,' ' piert,' 'doncy,' and many western phrases; he did not believe I would ever find you using them. I reckon I will, after you've lived with :hoosiers' and 'suckers' as long as I have." "Your mother and your brother never speak in this way," replied Marion, blushing at the reported compliment; "they-seem like eastern people alto- gether." "But I was a weeny child when we came here," continued Alice, "and brother a grown man; besides, if he lived among Indians, he would not learn anything he didn't choose to. He's such a dear, kind, trusty strong one," she added, the tears coming into her eyes as she spoke; "-he has labored night and day to raise us all, just shutting himself out of pleasure, and tugging at hard work for the sake of mother and-us children. He has put the other boys in school at Peoria, and all with his own hard earnings."   Thee Prairie in a ig.   '103 "He is noble, indeed," replied Marion;-"-0one cannot help admiring him." "Yes, and loving him, too," continued the:sister. "He took money he was in right need of, to buy this chair; he don't care a picayune for himself. I'm so sorry this case came on to-day; he'll be worked up when he finds you've been here all day and he' not at home. Ah, he knew your father would not let you cross the prairie to-day.' I'll have a right laugh at him when he comes. You'll stay all night, of course?" "O0 no, Alice; I believe it is time I should go now. Yes, papa told me five, and it only wants fifteen minutes." Mrs. Leighton added her persuasions to those of Alice, on the ground of the danger, but Marion assured them she had no fear. She left, after many charges not to try to guide the pony, as he would probably go directly home" himself. There was nothing exhilarating in the ride, though Albus started off briskly. The fog continued as ever, and Marion, laying the reins on the neck of:the pony, suffered him to take his own gait, while she wandered' into a reverie, from which there was nothing to divert her attention. At length she bethought herself that by this time she' should have come -into a patch of hazel bushes that served as a landmark, when she was startled by the splashing of the horse's feet in a clear stream of water. Now she was quite sure- she was not in the right track; no -such stream lay between the village and her home, "Thick coming fancies" crowded about her, but she put them away by an   104 .      awthorndean. act of will, and reflected soberly. Brooks, she knew, marked the timber land, and there were no woods. in.- her proper route. Under the same circumstances, alone; in that vast, unifthabited region, without the slightest guide to the haven where :she ewould be, her sister Rosine\would have probably succumbed, and perhaps fainted on the spot, but Marion was made- of -sterner stuff. It is true, a thrill of horror ran through her frame as she realized that a moonless night was rapidly approaching, and that she had no hope of even a star to guide her, but after deliberate consideration, she turned the horse's head, sure that her road was not across that brook. Albus very reluct- antly obeyed the bit, started on a new tack, and for another half hour she rode "along, thinking of the surprise Mrs. Leighton had expressed when she saw her in the morning, and wondering if her father could have realized the danger when he so reluctantly parted from her. It was past sunset when the pony came to a stand, on the- borders of the same brook he had before striven to cross. For a moment the per- fect loneness of her position, and the uselessness of all her efforts, came upon Marion. in their full force, and dropping the reins on the neck of the animal and dismounting, she clasped her hands with dreadful earnestness. She could see nothing through the fog and darkness but the faint glim- mer of -the water. For an instant, she threw herself on the ground in terror, thinking of the doomed man, whose cell grew daily narrower, till it crushed him in its dire embrace; another   iThe P'airie in a Fog.   105 moment and she aroused herself to action; taking off her hat, she bathed her forehead and hands in the water that crept lazily along the bed of the brook.. The sharp bark of the prairie wolves made her heart beat more violently, though she. knew , there was no real danger from them. The pony whinnied and pawed impatiently, he certainly seemed to have-a purpose in" the way in which he planted his feet on the brink of the water; she had tried guiding him, she would now give up, and let him go his own way, anything was better than standing still. It was now dark, few can realize how dark In' that dreadful hour it may be supposed memory was active, and the past brought vividly before her mind, more especially the injustice which she had done- her father when he thwarted her wishes the previous day; this, with the reproof of the morning, and the reluctant farewell, were painted in glowing colors all over that Cimmerian atmosphere. She, leaned over'the neck of her pony in as despairing a condition as one of her nature could well be; she mounted again but did not offer to take the reins, and the animal went on his way seemingly rejoicing in his freedom. It seemed to her a whole night that she had rode over the long tangled grass, her bodily strength was becoming exhausted, her dress was saturated with the condensing moisture, and -her whole frame chilled by the night air. At length Albus came to a sudden halt, and she sunk from her saddle completely prostrated." Here I may die," was her last conscious thought.  As the twilight came on and his daughter did   Hawthorndean.  not appear, Mr. Benton grew anxious. "It is time Marion was here," he said at length, after he had walked out. in the direction of the village many times, and held his breath to listen for the sound of the pony's feet. Mrs. Benton observed a slight trembling in his voice, as he spoke and came near to her.  "Do you think there is real danger?" she inquired. "I hope not," he replied hastily. "I have-felt all day, that I was foolish to let my tenderness for my child get the better of my judgment, I hoped she would yield the point herself." Mrs. Benton said nothing, but turned away to watch her slumbering infant, and to pray for her loved one, "set in the midst of so many and great dangers." It was the first time Philip Benton had put foot in a neighbor's house, when he crossed the thresh- old of Mrs. Leighton's cottage to inquire for Marion. Horror-stricken were Mrs. Leighton and Alice ,by the inquiry; she had been gone from there.two. hours. "Then- she is lost!" exclaimed Mr. Benton, in a tone of dismay. Horatio Leighton entered at a side door, as this conversation passed at the front entrance. The young man comprehended the whole matter at once, though. he had not till then heard that Marion had been at the cottage. He waited for nothing, but going tQ the stable he saddled a fresh horse and appeared at the door, before Mrs. Leighton and Alice had finished their inquiries of Mr. Benton.   The. Prazirie in a Fog.   10o7   "We had best ride after Miss Benton," he said, at once; " if you please sir, I will ride over for Rice and rouse up a few of the neighbors to our assist- ance." Mrs. Leighton came out with a lantern, and:saw by its light the deadly paleness of her son's face. "Do you think you will be able to find her-is there danger, Horatio ?" she whispered. "Danger of fright," he replied under his breath, "soothe Alice, this will make her ill. I trust we shall be back before long," he added' aloud, fasten- ing the lantern into his broad hunting-belt. Mr. Benton shut himself up instantly when alone with the young man, consenting to the mustering a few of the neighbors, begging they might be as few as possible. Old Cap came out to meet them as they approached his cabin, with his mouth open, spitting here and there unceremoniously, and utter- ing a "by golly" by way of filling up the pauses, as Leighton told his errand; looking keenly at the young man's hand that. trembled as he adjusted the lantern. "Why lad," he said, gazing into his face, "'pears like you've been lost yourself some of these ere days! Wbat 'ill you gin me now to find the pooty gal for ye?" Mr. Benton drew himself up on his horse and bit his lip in silence. "No joking, Cap," replied Leighton; "this is a serious business, and we want your help; shall we get out Ingle and Hendig? It's dark as Egypt, you see, and Miss Marion will be frightened to death." ' Now, don't take it so nigh to heart, my young chap," replied Rice, hallooing in the next breath   lo8      Hawthorndean.  to his boys to bring round the sheltie. "I know  : the prairie all over," he continued; "why, I've been X lost, let me see-oncet, twicet, three timest-and  } I found the trail back. But tell us the beast the ? gal rode?" he said, addressing Mr. Benton. "The white pony," replied the father, laconi- cally. "Raised at McGarity's, up to Panther Crik, he?" "Yes," replied Mr. Benton as before. "The gal's over there by this time," he said, taking out his tobacco-box, and passing it first to Mr. Benton, and then to young Layton, saying, "Have some? it's powerful good for the grips." The gentlemen refused, Mr. Benton quite un- graciously. "Waal," said Rice, replacing the box, and mounting his .horse, "the bacca is as good, if not., better'n your eastern truck. Come on, Zeb," he added, as if addressing the animal, "there's no need in routin the neighbors, it's plain enough whar the gal's gone; the beast would naturally go whar it's raised if it got the chance. I don't blame the little cob for cutting with such a gal on his back," he added, giving a wink to Leighton. Mr. Benton gave his own horse a smart cut, evi- dently intending the blow for his loquacious neigh- bor, while Leighton uttered an exclamation of impatient anger. "Come here, Bob-o'link," said Rice, whistling to a large wolfish looking dog, " may be you'll be of use; any way I want you on my side, for there 1b two of the party 'pears like will bite."'   The Prairie 'in a Fog.    109 "How do you expect to find McGarity's?" inquired Mr. Benton, when they were fairly started. "Old Zeb'll bring us thar in no time," he replied. "Why, he was foaled thar, and we naturally like whar we's raised-'^brung up,' you calls it at the cast. I've took track after old Zeb, why nigh a dozen times, clean over to Panther Crik, a right smart piece of twenty mile."   CHAPTER X. THE ANGEL COMES, AND THE FOG LIFTS. i"f^^ EING left with the care of her sick child; and with the thoughts of the unknown XI1 ^yperils to which her husband and daughter might be exposed, to Mrs. Benton the hours "crept with weary foot." "The dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience," filled up each moment as it passed. Jeannie had been unusually drowsy all day; about an hour after 'Mr. Benton's departure she partially aroused herself. "Denny tired," she whispered, as her mother attempted to waken her to take nourishment; "too tired," she added, as she sank back on the pillow. Her breath seemed tocome shorter and more feebly, and Mrs. Benton touched the feet of the child; they were icy cold. Eagerly she snatched the slumberer from the couch, as if in her mother's arms she would be safe, but the chilled brow and lips touched hers, as she pressed the dear one to her heart. She tried to call Sobriety, but the sound sleep of the healthy child was not easily disturbed. "Must I meet this alone?" whispered the mother, in the agony of her heart. I10   T/ze Fog Lits.       III Tears fell like rain, but they stirred not the slumberer so near the spirit land. No human eye save the mother's, witnessed the last heaving of that little breast. Death, the consoler, laying his hand upon that heart, healed it forever. An ear never heavy to the cry of His stricken ones, heeded that mother's sobs as she laid her dead back on the couch, and sunk on her knees beside it. After a time of grief, into which "a stranger intermeddleth not," she arose, calmed and quieted; the Angel had   left his impress on her brow. She parted those yellow curls over the fair fore- head, closed those parted lips, arranged those life- less limbs in the garments of the grave, and seated herself, one little hand in hers, to watch the coming day. Nearer than ever came to her the great mystery of death, in those lone hours of watching.; sweeter to her seemed the grave and its peaceful rest. Before morn, she could-from her heart thank the dear Shepherd that he had safely folded one of her lambs where no sin nor suffering could reach  her. Courage came back to her heart, courage still to labor, courage to meet and to comfort the worn, sad heart of her husband; courage to hope, courage to do. If any doubt the power of the Christian faith, let him place himself where Mrs. Benton was, and tell us what but the hope it brings, could give peace to her overcharged heart. A  severe thunder shower came on towards morning, and as she listened to the pealing roar, she could only quiet the  nervous restlessness which she felt, by resolving not to think of the dear absent ones, but only of the happy spirit so   II2     - Hawthorndean. lately born into Paradise. Sobriety appeared with the first dawn of day, and Mrs. Benton led her to the couch where lay the little sleeper. "O!" she screamed, darting back with terror; then settling in a moment into her usual mood, she said, looking earnestly at the pallid face,- "'Pears like she's nat'ral. I reckon he'll take on; he sot a heap by her; she is nice," and she stooped over the child, to hide the first tear that she had shed for many months. "Miss Marion read me about something," she continued, snatch- ing away her hand, which Mrs. Benton had taken, preparatory to an endeavor to impress a serious thought upon her darkened soul, and rushing out of the room, she returned in a few moments, her cheeks stained with tears, and in' her hand a tea- rose, with a white carnation, which she had plucked from Marion's few choice house-plants. "I don't care," she soliloquized, with a sobbing utterance, "if she is cross! I reckon she'd give these snips of posies for this;" and without hindrance from Mrs. Benton, she -clasped little Jeannie's cold fingers over the fresh flowers: the first touch of sentiment that had shown itself in her character, arguing well for the influence of her few weeks sojourn at the Prairie Home.  , The ride in search of Marion was nearly a silent one. Leighton having tired of Rice's talk, did not reply to his questions; but Old Cap stuffed his mouth with tobacco, and vowed "he could be as mum as any on 'em." When they came to the creek where Marion  had paused, gone back, and came again, the dog   Tze Fog Lifts.      II3 uttered a low growl. "She's been here, that's sartin," said Mr. Rice, dismounting and carrying the lantern along the brink of the brook; "this ere is Crow Crik." Presently he found small fresh-foot-prints of a horse. While he was looking for the tracks, Leigll- ton dismounted, attracted by the movements of Bob-o'link, and discovered in his mouth the black feather which was so familiar to him. "This must have dropt from Miss Marion's riding-hat," he said, and, without observing Mr. Benton's hand held out for it, he fastened the token in the button- hole of his own coat. Anxious and troubled as the father already was, this movement caused him a sharp feeling, of regret. , The speed of the party was quickened by the assurance that they were on the track; and about midnight old Zeb started into a brisk canter, pricked up his ears, and uttered a low neigh, which was immediately answered in the distance, while the animal Mr. Benton rode gave the same sign of recognition. "We're nigh McGarity's," said Rice; "hear the beasts, they don't forget old cronies." In a few moments the horses stopped under the low porch that sheltered the log cabin. There was neither light nor sound about the premises. "Can she be here?" exclaimed young Leighton, in a tone of disappointment.          a "We'll soon know that," replied Rice, striking I emphatically on the door with his heavy riding- whip, and calling out in a stunning voice,-"Stranger!" A growl from within was the only reply. "They're 10*           .    I4 '     ilawthorndean. mighty -still about it," said Rice, repeating the blow and--the call, which brought a succession of fierce barks, and a heavy movement. Presently the door was opened, and a man appeared, evidently having been disturbed in his first nap, being clothled from head to foot in red flannel. "What's the row?" he -inquired, gruffly. Mr. Benton's heart sunk at these words; he knew by that query that all hopes of finding Marion here were at an end; and he turned away, slowly driving from the house, to avoid hearing the characteristic recapitulation of the events of the night from his rough neighbor. He guided his horse around the corner of the cabin to avoid the south wind, which was beginning to blow a gale. The agony of that moment it is difficult to describe; he had- been buoyed up by the certain hope of finding his daugh- ter here, and now his hands, and" feet, and will were powerless in the-search. His wife alone with her sick child, and utterly ignorant of his own or of Marion's whereabouts; the approaching storm threatening to deluge the land, and his child with- out shelter-and where--? He had difficulty in restraining the animal upon which he rode, who continually pulled at the bit, *and reached out her head, as if in search of some- thing; presently a peculiarly affectionate and gentle neigh was heard just before him, which he recog- nized at 'once.. In an instant he was on his feet, and the next moment, Albus was rubbing his nose against him- in token of recognition. He put his hand upon the saddle, it was empty; and the fearful thought that his daughter had fainted- with   The Fog Lits.       15 fright, and fallen from her horse in that wilderness of grass, struck a blow upon his heart that caused him to stagger and groan. The, attention of Leighton and the rest of the company, men, women and children, who had left their slumbers, and assembled about the cabin door to listen, was attracted by the groan. Lights flickered about, and the white pony was soon discovered with his head resting lovingly on Meg's neck. The young McGaritys came around him with not the most flattering remarks about "dad" for selling the little pet. In the meantime the dog Bob-o'link was restlessly running about his master's heels, and pulling at his coat tail. "This feller knows more nor we do," Rice whispered to Leighton, "let's foiler." The saga- cious animal led the way to the leeward of a group of haystacks, and there in a snug nook between two of the largest of the stacks, lay Marion, as if the pony knew the very place where she would be most sheltered, he had here first halted. Rice held the lantern to her face, while Leighton raised her head; she was still insensible. Her hat had fallen from her head, and with it her comb, leaving her long hair streaming over her face. "Be she dead?" inquired the elder of two little ones who had followed the lantern. "No," said Rice, gruffly; "scatter every -chick of yer, and tell yer mum to strike up so'thin hot for the, gal." The good news travelled quickly, and Mr. Ben- ton hurried toward the stack, in time to meet- Leighton carrying Marion to the house. Th e   T16:j     )VL'.Hawhtorndean. father's strength was prostrated by the sudden revulsion of feeling, and he followed Leighton without a word. His presence of mind returned when he reached the miserable apology for a bed, which had been disturbed of its occupants to re- ceive the young lady, and with a wave of the hand to the rest of the company, he requested that they would allow himself and the good Mrs. McGarity to wait on Miss Benton. Leighton immediately retired to the further corner of the room, taking the young ones with him. Mr. Benton was a sorry nurse, and Mrs. McGarity was not much better; she bustled -about hither and thither, wondering if the girl wanted any truck; made a great noise, scolded the children, and did nothing. Rice stood 'before the immense fire-place in which he had kindled a fire, his hands folded behind him, his cheeks stuffed with tobacco, and his eyes riveted on the girl, as she lay in that helpless state. Driven away as he had been by Mr. Benton, he proffered no advice, but the expression on his face was a singular mixture of anxiety and mirthfulness. He could restrain himself no longer, when the old woman took a box from the shelf, saying, "she reckoned this would do Miss a heap o' good," and Rice reached out his long arm -and snatched the box from her hand. "I vow!" he exclaimed, ?'if the old critter wasn't a gpin' to give her queenine-queenine for a faint!" she don't- know- nothin but queenine and marcary! Give the gal a sling,/ mum," he said, bringing his hand down on the shelf, -to the manifest. risk of sundry vials and packages of doctor's stuff thereon deposited,   The Fog Lijts.      x17 "Give the gal a stiff sling, I say, marm; untack her stays, and give her breathin room; put so'thin hlot to her feet, and give her a sling." No sooner was the suggestion made than carried out. Mr. Benton had been so bewildered he had not thought to loosen her clothes, but had busied himself chafing her benumbed hands. The powerful whisky sling was made ready from the steaming kettle, which Rice, with his customary forethought, had hung over the fire. Innocent Mrs. McGarity, as soon as whisky was mentioned, seemed to come to her senses, and con- tinued to administer it externally and internally. The storm had now commenced in real earnest, the wind roared and howled across the- prairie, and shook the cabin to its foundation. The lightning played in fantastic streaks about the premises, and the thunder roared and roared again, with a strange underground reverberation. The hot sling assisted the powers of nature in restoring Marion's con- sciousness; she opened her eyes and looked about' bewildered, a slight color came back to her cheeks and lips, but utter weariness, together with the sling, induced drowsiness before she could so far recover herself as to speak, and she sunk into a heavy slumber, from which she had not aroused when the gray of morning appeared in the east, showing a clear sky, a pure silver crescent just fading before the new day, and the green earth rejoicing in her freedom from the spectral fog, that had- so long shrouded her beauty. "Waal, I  reckon I'll go," said Rice, at the first streak of dawn, "there aint no use for me here."   - rI8    .  .awthorndzean. : "Not- till you've had grub," replied the notable Mrs. McGarity, swallowing the glass of whisky of which Marion had received the first half. In a moment all was bustle and business in preparation for a meal. One child was dispatched for fuel to replenish'the fire, a second was delegated to pound the coffee which was tied in a bag and bruised between two stones for want of a mill. The ham was cut in large thick slices and put to frizzling over the fire, around which children and chickens huddled together, the latter coming -and going at pleasure between the stones that composed the chimney. Mr. Benton grew impatient when he saw preparations for eating, and going to Leighton, who, from the window, moodily watched the ap- proaching day, he spoke with less of pride -and more of manly confidence: "Will you help me to -get out of this place with my daughter, as soon as possible?" "It will never do," replied Leighton, drawing away from the listening children, "to refuse their hospitality, they would in return refuse to assist us; we must stay, and try to eat. I will go and make arrangements for leaving immediately after, if you wish." Mr. Benton -thanked him, and the young man went out gladly from the stifling air of the cabin, and made everything ready for their departure. When he returned, the breakfast was spread on a :long -table which filled the best part of the common room; it was spread with a variety, to say the least: there was apple-butter and pumpkin-butter; piles of bread cut in chunks and potato pies; these with   The Fog Lifts,      II19 the ham and the coffee, which in spite of the primi- tive method of preparation was really delicious, served to make what is called in western phrase a steadfast meal. "We have nothijn but corn-meal and common doins," said the hostess, while she pointed Mr. Leighton to a seat. "I reckon you're used to wheat meal and chicken fixens," she added, nodding to Mr. Benton. This gentleman, in obedience to the beseeching look on the young man's face, took a place at the table and tried to eat. Rice entered heart and soul into corndodgers and apple-butter, while Leighton's experience of cabin life made him find good even in Mrs. McGarity's "common doins," and he praised the viands inordinately, to cover Mr. Benton's want of appetite. As they rose from the table, the wagon Leighton had prepared was driven to the door, arranged with buffalo robes on a bedding of straw. The large horses of the host were in the harness, while the three horses on which they had come were saddled and bridled, Meg mounted by one of the McGaritys, leading the pony. Mr. Benton humbled himself to shake hands with the hostess in parting, and desired to leave a- substantial token of his gratitude in the shape of a gold piece, but Mrs. McGarity could be as proud as he, in her way, and she would not touch the money; therefore the only thing to be done was to express the hope that he should see her and her husband at his house. Marion, who had come to herself sufficiently to know what was going on about her, was lifted by   120   -    zawlthoqrdean. her father into the wagon, he talking his seat beside her, with her head resting on his lap. Leighton drove -the horses attached to the vehicle, while Rice, with the boy who was to bring back the wagon, came behind, leading the two riderless horses, and the cavalcade went forth amid the cheers and shouts of the young McGaritys, and the shrill voice of their mother scolding them for their noise. When within a mile of their own door, Mr. Benton was startled by an exclamation from Leighton: "Really, if I can trust my eyes, here comes Sobriety'!" Across the unfenced lawn bounded the young girl with the step of a deer, her hair, which had attained some -length under Mrs. Benton's fostering care, streamed in the wind, and her arms were raised wildly; she was bonnetless and barefooted. "She's all dead!" were the only words she could find breath to utter, when the horses were reined in to meet her. Mr. Benton aroused himself with a start, and I Marion, who had recovered sufficiently to sit up, ! made a vain effort to rise. The father sprung from the wagon, mounted Meg instantly, and was gone before Sobriety could find words to explain. "'Pears we better not stop," said Rice to the boy, after Marion had been lifted from the wagon; "there's death here, and they don't want strangers," and slipping a silver piece'into the boy's hand, he turned the horses' heads toward Panther Creek, and mounting his own beast, made the best of his ,way -home. Her mother did not come at once to Marion'^   The Fog Lifts.      I 2 1 ,assistance; she was soothing the bleeding heart of her poor husband, who had centred his paternal. love in this frail flower, and refused to be com- forted for his darling Jeannie. Leighton waited to offer further services, -arranging the pillows where Marion rested, for she was unable to stand, and sympathizing with her in her stinging sorrow. At length Mrs. Benton came from the inner room, worn and wan with the intense anxieties -of the night, but still gentle and thoughtful for others; she quieted her daughter's hysterical sobbing, and begged her to be calm for her own sake. i I want to help you, Mrs. Benton," said Leigh- ton, coming from the window; "will you tell me what I can do?" "If you would," she said, warmly, "spare my dear husband the agony of preparing the last rest- ing-place for his child." "Where shall it be?" inquired the young man. "In  the grove of locusts, that Mr. Benton planted this spring,-in the opening toward the house, where I may-see it from my window." Mr. Leighton selected the spot in the enclosure where the first rays of the sun would find 'the narrow home of the clay so precious as the germ of immortality, and there he dug the tiny grave. A few days after, at sunset, Philip Benton with his family and the friendly Leightons stood  gazing into that lone burial-place. Silently they kneeled around that quiet grave, with prayers whispered in their hearts to Him whose pitying eye regardeth the sorrows of his children. A   long month of suffering consequent on Mar- i1   1 22      Hawthorndean. ion's fright and exposure restrained Mrs. Benton in the expression of her grief for her little comforter, and as her daughter grew better, trials came in a more dreaded shape. As the season advanced the whole region of Athlacca, with many other town- ships, was visited with numerous and sudden deaths from congestive fever. The village post- master, a Campbellite preacher, and the quack- doctor who had just hung his sign in Athlacca, were carried off by the scourge in a few days. Mr. Benton felt secure by his separation from the haunts of men; but excessive toil and exposure to night-dews predisposed him to a disease origi- nating in miasma. Mrs. Benton had gone with her husband to the newly made grave, and assisted him in placing a wooden 'cross he had himself carved, as a headstone. Their conversation was of the past, but more of that "Happy harbor of God's saints, That sweet and pleasant soil Wherein no sorrow can be found, No grief, no care, no toil." The naturally proud tone of the husband was subdued to the gentleness of a child, as he for the first time made known his determination to follow his dear conmpanion in the way of the cross, to confess his sins and amend his life. They lingered long near the charmed spot till their garments were saturated with the night-dew. Marion was aroused from her first slumber that nirllt, by Sobriety standing by her bedside, lantern in hIand.   'Thke Fog Lifts.     I23 "I'm goin for the Doctor, Miss; your pap's sick, you better stir, and help your mum." Marion sprung from the couch. "Are you crazy, child!" she said, looking at the girl; "the Doctor lives four miles from here, and there's no moon." "I knows the stars," she replied. "Let me go with you,"' exclaimed Marion, eagerly. "Let's saddle Meg and go together." "And have another dead one belike," replied Sobriety scornfully; "your face is as white as taller! No, stay with your mum, you'll do a heap more good that way." The girl flew off without another word, and Marion hurried to her father's room. She found him in a burning fever, delirious, and calling for Jeannie. "Marion," said her mother, trembling from head to foot, "we ought to have a physician at once. I am afraid this is that: dreadful fever; could you watch him closely while I try to go for somebody?" 'You, dear mamma !" exclaimed Marion; "why Sobriety has been gone for the Doctor some time." "Sobriety! that child!" said Mrs. Benton; "can she find the way, the night is dark? O, my daugh- ter, there is help only in God. May he send a good Angel to guide that child-and we  must wait." Mr. Benton's delirium at length fixed itself in memories of those dreadful last days, of their sojourn east, and it was like going over those harrowing scenes again to hear his self-accusing words. There was only one way in which he could be at all quieted through that fearful night. " Mrs. Benton held his hand in hers and repeated again and again the fourth penitential Psalm; he   1 24      ]Tawthorndean. would follow word for word; but the moment ste paused or varied in her repeating, the delirium would return, he would snatch his hot hand from hers where it had rested quietly, and toss his arms about wildly. In less than three hours Sobriety returned, bringing Leighton with her, having dis- patched Mr. Rice for the Doctor. Mr. Leighton watched and waited through that severe illness, when a precious life hung on a thread, wondering at the 'wife's endurance of a fatigue that told on his stout frame. The Doctor, with whom  our story becomes familiar as we advance, was an intelligent m:an, with six years' experience in the west. He had moved to Athlacca from the distant town where he had lived, attracted by the solicitation of the head of the newly established see of Chicago. The Rt. Reverend gentleman was a personal friend of Dr. Nelson's; he recommended Athlacca as the place where the Church would soon be planted. The physician watched Mr. Benton with assiduous care, and by the blessing of God on his skill, the lamp of life, which at one time sunk in its socket and almost went out, was revived. The Doctor gave his opinion that excessive toil in a western climate would be disastrous to his patient, and recommended a change of occupation with returning health. !            '    CHAPTER XI. HOW OUR FAIR FRIENDS FARED AT THE FAIR. tr,  rHE   long advertised day for the great , Glai fair for the establishment of a home for disabled seamen found the extensive hall chosen for the exhibition beautifully pre- pared for the occasion. Fluttering banners with strange and brilliant devices, mingled their gor- geous colors with graceful evergreen wreaths that fair fingers had arranged. Fine old paintings and choice groups of statuary from the private resi- dences of the patrons adorned the radiant scene. Articles from every quarter of the- globe beautified the tables, while bevies of lovely girls and scores of attractive women gave brilliancy and beauty to the assemblage; but the centre of attraction in' this captivating picture to all eyes, was the flower- tables,  which formed a perfect green retreat, a bower of freshness and perfume, elevated from sur- rounding attractions upon a broad platform car- peted with fresh green moss. In the midst of the elevation, in the basin of a fountain curiously wrought in Italian marble, sat Neptune, in a chariot of bronze drawn by sea-horses, holding in his right hand his trident, from which, as well as from the shell trumpet which his son Triton, who stopd I25   I 26     htawthorndean. beside him, held to his mouth, issued fine streams of water, that falling back into the fountain, sprinkled with spray a world of aquatic plants in full flower, that bordered the jet d'eau. The ever- greens mingled their subdued color and balmy fragrance with the gorgeous hues and exquisite perfumes of neighboring flowers. Etruscan vases of magnificent proportionswere graced with choice camelias, while numerous vases of less pretensions were abundantly filled with- the most rare and deli- cate blossoms, and masses of cut flowers awaited the selection of the purchaser, and the delicate fingers of the attendants to be arranged into bou- quets to suit differing tastes. Mrs. Hartland, as prime mover and first manager of the fair, had carried out her plan in spite of obstacles arising from Dr. Hartland's objections, and persuaded the Colonel to request Rosine to accede to her wish that she should stand at the flower-table, with Laura Marten as leader. He was in his heart delighted with the prominence thus given to his favorite, and thought she was too young and simple-minded to be hurt by it, while Ned declared he would not go to see Rosine quiz- zed by all the idle young men who would naturally follow in the wake of Laura Marten. Rosine, when the plan was proposed, desired to decline the position, feeling that it would be a public declaration of her intimacy with Laura, and she had begun heartily to wish herself free, not- only as the advice of her best friends, but to quiet the reproaches of her own heart.  But moral courage was at first lacking, and when she did find   C7- H The Fair.       1-27 confidence to say to Mrs. Hartland that she would rather some one would take her place, that lady only replied with astonishment, that it was too late to make' any alterations in their plans, it would be a virtual breach of promise to resign a situation unless it was absolutely called for by inability; besides, the Colonel would be so disappointed. After this conversation Rosine accepted the posi- tion, as her destiny, and began to look forward to the day even with pleasure. She was startled by the abrupt farewell of the Doctor, as he handed his mother and herself into the carriage, in which Laura was already seated. "I suppose you call this renouncing the pomps and vanities of the world!" he said curtly, as he closed the door. "That's for me," replied Laura, laughing, "you see I am in mourning." She was arrayed in a black dress of gauzy material, which with the red coral ornaments on her neck and arms, set off the bril- liancy of her complexion, while among her raven curls flashed a wreath of carnations and green leaves, composed of garnets and emeralds. Rosine was dressed in white muslin, without ornament of any kind, save a wreath of green and white flowers in her golden locks. Mrs. Hartland bustled about in a stiff black moire antique, the matron of affairs, and at length settled herself among a rich display of' East India goods. -We shall not attempt a description of a fair, as a matter of business; they have become, with all their accompaniments, an institution in church and state, and are as familiar as the daily newspaper descrip-   128      Hawthorndean. tion of them (under the various names of festivals, tea-parties, fairs, and so forth, for the amelioration of the condition of the human race) can- make them. We shall only endeavor to interest our readers in -e employments and enjoyments of Laura and Rosine. For the first- half-day Rosine was as unnoticed apparently, as her best friends could wish; she merely assisted Laura in selecting and arranging bouquets as they were called for; but towards evening crowds of gentlemen thronged the flower- table, attracted by the continued fire of good- natured joke and repartee, with the familiar, confi- dential manner which Laura maintained toward those she desired to retain near her; a manner that much as the male sex may affect to despise it, is so pleasing, so flattering to their vanity, and coming from a pretty woman, in most cases it proves per-, fectly irresistible. An instinctive desire to witness Rosine's debut into the world, as Dr. Hartland had chosen to call her position at the fair, seized him after the car- riage drove away, but he stoutly resisted, deter- mined not to show any interest in the matter. But the wisha returned toward evening when his last patient was visited, and he was obliged to. pass the hall on his way home. A wonderfully good opinion had Edward Hartland of his powers of self-control, nevertheless he found his way through the throng about the door and into the gallery, where he could witness the performances without being himself observed. It was the bewitching .-time between daylight and   The Fair.       129 dark; many of the afternoon crowd had dispersed, and the evening multitude had not yet gathered, when Laura Marten listened to the oft-repeated request of one of her numerous band of admirers, and consented to promenade through the hall. Rosine blushed painfully as she heard this assent given to a stylish looking gentleman, who had devoted himself to Laura most of the day; she begged her friend not to leave her with the whole care of the table, but she pleaded fatigue, pointed to the few persons remaining in the hall, promised to return very soon, and finally took the gentle- man's arm and went off among a bevy of admirers, who followed her even here. Rosine's diffidence would not have been so great, had she realized how entirely alone she would be left after Laura's departure; not a person inquired for flowers for many minutes, or looked at her with the slightest interest. Left so entirely to herself she at last took a seat, being much fatigued, and soon became absorbed in watching Laura as she walked and chatted, first with one, then with another; quickly loosing her arm from  the first gentleman at a request to arrange a flower in the button hole of a coat, casting her bewitching, fascinating, intoxicat- ing glances right and left, coquetting with one, talking seriously with another, still clinging fondly to the arm of her first companion, till Rosine began to wonder if the secret she had confided to her could be true--could she be engaged to Lieu- tenant Hartland? "A  penny for your thoughts," spoken in a saucy tone, first aroused her from the reverie into   1 30 -    Hawumaorndan. which she had fallen, and she became conscious of the presence of two sophomoric youths standing near the table. They had evidently enjoyed her abstraction and were amusing themselves at her expense. She felt the crimson that dyed her neck and cheek as she came forward to receive their wishes. "By Jove! what a blush!" said one of the youngsters, stepping back and surveying her from head to foot through his eye-glass. "Verdant as these flowers," responded the other in an undertone, which was distinctly audible to Rosine. "The maid in a mist is a beautiful flower, and very apropos," drawled the other, tumbling over the roses, cape jasmines, and cut flowers generally, as if looking for the flower he had named. "Love in a mist you mean," said his companion, continuing his survey of Rosine through his eye- glass. "Do you understand the language of flowers?" inquired the elder of the two, leaning over the table familiarly. "Please give me--let's see-the white rose bud-too young to love--that's appropriate, Will," he said, winking at his chum. At that instant, as if he came from beneath the floor, a tall gentleman in the fatigue dress of a naval officer came between the young men, and laying a hand on the shoulder of each, in a per- fectly calm, self-possessed and resolute voice, he said, "You are annoying this young lady, and I call upon you to desist." "By what authority;,pray?" questioned the elder YX    The Fain.       I3I of the two, endeavoring to shake off the hand that rested on him, and looking impertinently into the face of the stranger.          , "By the authority of a gentleman, and if, you do not understand that character, I will call the police," he replied coolly. The youngsters sneaked off, leaving the odor of a few profane words behind them, while the officer selecting a bouquet of heliotrope and pansies, departed before Rosine could summon words to thank him for his interference. Not long after, Laura returned to her work, and Rosine eagerly "related her adventure, hoping thereby to learn to whom she was indebted; but her description; "tall, dark hair and eyes, good figure, in the fatigue dress of a naval officer," was so indefinite, that Laura declared there had been twenty men in the hall answering to that description, and laughing heartily, she called the Colonel, who had just come to the table, to tell him the romantic story, and put him to guessing who the stranger could be. The gentleman, however, had left the hall and was seen no more there. He had come into the assemblage without any special aim, and having sauntered to the book table, he made a purchase' from the valuable selection. Weary of elbowing his way through the crowd, he passed into a green nook near the flower-table, secure from observation; and to while away the time till the -throng had dispersed, he seated himself on the platform and opened his book, then the talk and wonder of the day. He had become deeply interested in this work of an unknown, author, when Rosine's voice   I132      Hawthorndean. begging Laura not to leave her, reached him; after that the volume was forgotten, as he watched the trembling of her fingers as she arranged the nose- gays for the very few purchasers who remtained, and wondering in his own mind, how long this bashfulness and timidity would continue; especially under Laura Marten's influence, whom he well knew. He felt sympathy for Rosine when he was satisfied that her diffidence was real; he caught himself listening to her modest replies to the few questioners, and accusing himself of ungentlemanly conduct, he resorted again to the book, and was deeply absorbed in the boarding-school experience of Jane Eyre, when the words "a penny for your thoughts," spoken with an air and tone of insolent effrontery, reached his ear; he closed his book and became again a listener, but only for a moment,- all the impulses of a gentleman calling him to become the protector of the young girl so insulted. This- episode in the performances had entirely escaped the notice of Dr. Hartland, though he had come there to watch Rosine. His soul was stirred within him as he marked the intense flirtation between Laura and Le Compte, and he was. men- tally congratulating his brother Aleck on his escape. He came down from the gallery just as the Colonel took his position by Rosine, offering to assist her. "Come, Rosa," said the Doctor, approaching the table without deigning to see Laura, who had now returned to- her work, "come, it is high time you had a little recreation. Come, walk with me,." "Thank you, Ned," she replied, "the Colonel    The Fair.      133 was asking me to promenade with' him, but I am too tired." "Then come out of this place," he said, looking daggers at a party who just then ordered bouquets of particularly difficult selection; " go with me for refreshments, you look as if you needed, some- thing." Rosine shook her head -as her tiny fingers knot- ted the flowers together, and again took her seat wearily. "Then I shall come in and help you," said the Doctor. "I can put up posies as well as pills; but what have you here?" he added, as in passing round the table he laid his hand on a volume that had been concealed by a heavy branch of hemlock, and a bouquet that had fallen from one of the vases. "Jane Eyre! indeed, Rosa, do you find time for this?" She rose from her seat to: examine the book, found the page doubled down as a mark, and looked at the Doctor as if for an explanation. "' Indeed," she said, blushing under his earnest gaze, s I know nothing of it. O!" she exclaimed, after an instant, the blush deepening to a crimson, "it must belong to that gentleman. I remember now he had a book in his hand, and laid it down while -he fastened the flowers he purchased to. his vest button; he must have left it!"       . "' That gentleman,' is a very indefinite personage," replied? the Doctor, "will you show him., to me?' Laura laughed heartily, and without noticing Dr. Hartland's cold manner toward herself, s5he exclaimed,: "O Ned, you have not heard what a 12   134      Hawthorndean. heroine Rosa has become?" and she related the adventure: wihh th te college boys in her piquant coloring everything with her own fancy in spite of Rosine's repeated assurance that she was incorrect : in her statements, till she had made "quite-: a' phantasy of the simple incidents; the Colonel joining heartily with her in the laugh at the expense of Rosine, when she came to tell that noo:trace of this naval knight-errant could he found, i':and advising her by all means to keep the book, asi it; might lead to his discovery. The Doctor frowned savagely on Laura and quietly put the Ivolume :into his pocket. "':Father," said Edward Hartland that evening after the ladies had retired, "do you wish to see Rosa down- sick-at the end of these two weeks :of folly? If not, it is you that must break up this arrangement. Don't you see she makes a religious duty of- the -matter? she don't play with her work as :Laura-Marten and most of the girls do." Colonel Hartland looked quite grave as he said, 'Areti you joking, Ned? or do you really think this will be a serious tax upon Rosa? She certainly I6bked pale. and languid to-night, but then the woirk is so new to her; she will get used to it in a few days, and understand taking it more easily." :"Itm; n-otjoking, sir. She will be in my hands by the':end of a month; she don't understand 6quetting-with business like the other table- tennderit and getting amusement out of it." it only:a fancy of your mother's," replied his father; "though I did'- hear several gentlemen say, the'efiirorastl Kat the flower-table between the glow-   Fe Fair.      '135 ing brilliancy of Laura and the delicate. loveliness of Rosa, was one of the prettiest tableaux of, the evening; but I will talk with her in the morning; she can, of course, do as she pleases in the matter." The next morning during the breakfast hour Laura was announced, ready to proceed to' her day's work. The Colonel detained Rosine as they rose from the table, to speak to her of the matter on his mind, while Doctor Hartland went directly -to the library. Miss Marten was standing with her back toward the door, gazing at a portrait of him- self and Aleck taken in their boyhood. He came suddenly upon her, and with a hand on either shoulder, turned her about instantly. ["Laura," he said in a stern voice, "do you know that Le Compte with whom you conducted such an intense flirtation last evening?" * Don't be so rude," she replied in a vexed tone, endeavoring to shake herself free of him; "you are as rough as a bear, Ned!" "No, you don't get away till you've answered my question. Do you know this Dr. Le Compte?" "No," replied Laura, coloring slightly as she met the Doctor's piercing gray eye, " now let me go.,' "Then let me tell you," said Dr. Hartland, loos- ing his hold and speaking a shade more mildly, "Iet' me tell you once for all, if you burn your fingers with him, it is not without warning. He: is one of the most notorious characters engendered- in the foulest atmosphere of London, Paris or New York. If I had a sister or a wife, 1 would rather see her'-yes, I'd rather see her dead before my eyesp , than' to see her' as.

You can,'t:-come off from a flirtation with him as you might from one with Aleck or me." : -He smiled faintly as he uttered the last words, but there was no answering smile on her face, and she turned away- to the window as Colonel Hartland enteredi with Rosine. The young girl saw-that the Colonel in his heart would really be disappointed if she gave up her position at the table, and she could not: plead weariness, for she was quite rested after her nights sdeep; her conscience continued to" fret her a- little, but she had no time to listen, and the"-false jplea, that she was performing an act of   The Fair.       137 self-denial quieted her for awhile. She was much disturbed by Laura's proceedings, and wofidered if she-had entirely forgotten Aleck; Laura- herself mwas annoyed by the warning of Edward Hartland; it sounded in her ears continually, and Aleck's ring was on her finger, while her promise had been given to Le Compte for a ride the next Sunday. She wondered if what Ned said of him could be true. or if he were jealous; she remembered that Aleck had told her in one of their confidential moments that the Doctor himself was not insensible to her charms, and her woman's'vanity put the Doctor's caution down to the charge of self-interest. "That's it, he's piqued," she said to herself, and tried to forget his admonition. Each day of the fair went by much as the first.. Laura was for a day or two more guarded, but before the week was over she was persuaded that Ned Hartland must be mistaken; she knew enough of the male sex, she thought, to find out something of the villany of such a man as the Doctor had, represented Le Compte, in a whole week's acquaint- ance. Rosine ventured to ask her the only mo- ment they were alone, "If she thought Aleck would be pleased to see her 'so fond of her new admirer." "Fond! nonsense!" she replied, "it is only for a little amusement. It would be absurd in Aleck to wish me to mope around alone during his long absence, or shut myself up like a forlorn widowr! He has too much good sense to ask it." Doctor Hartland proffered no advice, but when he saw how matters were -going on, he sternly 12*   hIawthorndean. commanded her on no account to introduce'her new lover, as he called Le Compte, to Rosine, on. penalty of having her removed at once from the table. As Doctor Hartland had predicted, the excitement and fatigue of the fair told on Rosine's delicate nature; but the true cause of her restless nights and unquiet days was to be found in a letter from her mother, which came through Sister Agnes, to avoid the inspection of Mrs. Hartland. It was written with a full knowledge of her wants and wanderings, and she felt that her delinquencies, her want of Christian courage, had added a new\ weight to the already very heavy burden that rested on fier beloved parent. The excitement and stimulation of the day, and the reproachful whispers of the night, soon brought loss of appetite as well as loss of sleep, but she did not complain, although she felt the strain upon her nervous system in great weakness. Lessons were resumed after the fair was closed, the money counted, the excitement over, but she found herself wholly unable to fix her attention, and she was surprised by her French: teacher inquiring in the midst of her reading if she were asleep. 4The next morning while endeavoring to elude the watchful eyes of Dr. Hartland, by appearing to; partake of her breakfast, she becamer'so faint as to be obliged to leave the table.  "There, Rosa," said the Doctor, rising and going- to her assistance, "I have been looking for this; you'll have to give in; I have watched you dragging yourself about, but have waited till you were read, for my advice." The faintness increased as: he.   The Fair.   r39   spoke. "Here, mother," he added, "'just loosen this child's dress; I think we can prevent an entire swoon. Simple exhaustion! Perfect rest and quiet- ness is all she needs," he said to his father, who stooped over her with distressed face; "she must just lie down and rest body and mind." Laura Marten came in the afternoon while Rosine was vainly trying for a nap on the library sofa. Her friend was excited as she knelt before her and kissed her cheek. "I'm sorry dear," she said, "this fair business has used you up so con- pletely. I am as weak as a chicken. I've just, heard the Pocahontas is in the harbor, she will bring letters from Aleck, mine will ,come enclosed' in yours. You will be careful dearest," she con- tinued, seizing her hand, "I don't know but Ned would nearly kill me if he knew, but you will be careful." "It is not right," said Rosine, her heart beating violently with the thought of being accessory to a clandestine correspondence, "this is not right, and it is a sin for you to go on so with Le Compte. I wish you would not. I asked Ned about him last night, and he was almost angry with me for speaking his name, and said it was a marked dis- grace for any'girl to have made his' acquaintance. Do be persuaded." "Ah, you little goosey," replied Laura, putting back the bright golden locks that had fallen over Rosine's flushed face, "you don't ,know much. Le Compte means nothing, neither do I; he knows this, so do I; what possible harm can there be in getting a little amusement out, of the man? I    "o0 -    tIlawthorndean.- have never seen anything of the monster Ned makes him; indeed, in manners of a gentleman, he bears comparison even with Dr. Edward Hartland. I tell you, Ned -views the subject with jaundiced eyes, and 'bends his brows upon me in a most terrific manner; but I like the game, if it is only to make the Doctor snarl; hut my engagement with Aleck must not come to his ear, if it did, he would pounce upon me with authority, and perhaps shut me up in' an insane asylum. So my precious and only friend, don't open your letter in his majesty's presence, lest he should spy the enclosure." ; "But don't you fear," exclaimed Rosine rising in lier excitement, "that he may write to Aleck about the matter; it would be' most natural to speak of you min his letters? O, Laura, do you, can you love' Aleck?" added she, covering her face with her hands and sinking back to her pillow, " it seems to me almost as bad as if a married woman should flirt." Laura started from her kneeling posture and walked away to the window without a word. "I did not mean to hurt your feelings, dear," said Rosine, again attempting to rise, "only to tell you how it seems to me." Dr. Hartland entered before Laura had recovered herself sufficiently to reply. He bowed stiffly to her,' and took his seat by the couch, noticing at once the flushed face and traces of tears upon his patient, and bit his lip in silence while he counted her pulse., "Miss Marten," he said with knit brows, "this young lady'must dispense with your company for:   T7he- Fair.      141 'the present, you have talked her intf a fever." Laura bowed haughtily-and left the room. "This visit has done you essential harm, Rosa," he said, modulating his voice to gentleness as the door closed, "it has put you back' at least two days. What could have been the subject of con- versation to bring you into the state you are at this moment?" he continued, laying his hand against her hot cheek. "I wish you had a worthier friend."   - "Laura doesn't mean as badly as you think, Ned," she replied timidly. "Don't -let her wheedle you into that notion. No woman can do as she has done ever since she was a woman without'meaning harm. But you must not talk," he added, seeing the color fade suddenly from her cheek, "you would be more quiet up stairs, I will have your room prepared."' He gave orders accordingly, and in a few moments a servant appeared, saying "Mrs. Hartland was waiting for Miss Rosine." "Here, sister," said the Doctor, stooping over her, "just puit your right arm about my neck." "O, Ned, thank you, but I can walk perfectly well," she replied. "Two flights of stairs in your weak state might hurt'you seriously," he said, still retaining his posi- tion; "if the Colonel were here he would carry- you; as it is, you must accept of my services." Rosine saw there was nothing to be gained by resistance, and she yielded. "There, mother," said the, Doctor as- he landed her in her own apartment, "just assist this httle   - 1a42 - - SHawftho Zdean. woman to, undress, she. must literally go to bed for at leasttwo days; in the meantime, shall I say," -he added, whispering to Rosine, "don't let any one be admitted?" {:"No: please Ned," she said beseechingly, "do lt"- Laura- come just once to-morrow." "I will see how you are in themorning; take this," he repliedi giving her a powder and don't trou- ble yourself about anything or anbody, but just stop thinking and go to sleep, and you'll be about aga in a few days;, but if you are not careful you will bsing on a nervous fever, which is one of the most uncomfortable and uncontrollable of diffi- culties--so I caution you. Good-night." During breakfast the penny-post brought the mail. "Ah," said Dr. Hartland, running over the \ letters, "two -from Aleck; -the Pocahontas is in the harbor. One for you," he added, passing a letter to his mother, "and one for i tosine-another for: Rosine from the West, I will take them to her." He found his patient with flushed cheeks, her eyes unnaturally bright and set in a dark circle, indicating loss of sleep. "I am stronger this morning," she answered as he -greeted her kindly, "though I did not sleep many hours. Have you any letters for me?" she inquired eagerly. The Doctor waited a. little as he counted her pulse, looked doubtfully at her crimson cheek, but at length produced the two: letters. "I don't think you ought to, read this voluminous epistle this morning," he said as he held the thick package   7The Fair.       3 from his brother in his hand, "as it is: fromAleck, perhaps you nlay let me read it for you?" "No! Ned, give it to me!' she- cried, trying to take it from himn.  "Be quiet, Rosa," he said soothingly, attributing ller lhaste to nervousness, " you know I would not read it without your permission." She still held out her hand impatiently for it, and with a quick eager movement put that letter under her pillow, and broke the seal of the letter from the prairie home. Nothing escaped Dr. Hartland's eye; for a moment it flashed across his mind that Aleck and Rosine might be especially interested in each other; but all their conduct denied this suspicion; he must look elsewhere for an explana- tion of this strange movement.. He leaned-. his head thoughtfully on his hand, while Rosine, her hands still trembling with excitement, slowly read her letter from Marion." He was startled from his reflections by the words, "You will let Laura-come.: to me, dear Ned, just once? I must see her a moment, and I am so much better." ' Better!" exclaimed the Doctor, raising his eye- brows. "I don't find you as well as I left you; there is more fever, and Rosa," he added, sadly," I do dread- Laura Marten's coming." She had never seen so much depth of -feeling in his expression, and-she imagined he thought her very ill. - ' Indeed, Ned," she urged, "-I am stronger, and I will not ask her to stay; I would'rather she woiild not, buft I -must say a few words to Jherto-day."' "( Secrets with Laura Marten will only bring you into trouble," he replied, looking fixedly at her face,   "4      Hawthorndean. as the conscious red -was- succeeded by a deaidly paleness,  He questioned her no further, but giving per- mission- to his mother for a short interview with- Miss Marten, he turned away from the grateful ex- pression and the pressure of his hand as she heard his consent, and the first shadow of doubt of his newly: found sister crossed his mind. After his departure Rosine endeavored to com- pose herself to sleep, but the letter under her pillow seemed to burn into her brain. Mrs. Hart- land bustled about the room, and it appeared an;- hour before the good lady took her departure, shutting out every ray of light. Fortunately a window was near, and Rosine soon found light -enough to assure herself there was an enclosure in hers from! Aleck. She ran over the few lines addressed toL herself, and then placing Laura's in; a safe place, tried to quiet her throbbing pulse, but the dreadful secret would not suffer her to rest.  The -next call of Dr. Hartlaind, in the evening,: found his patient more quiet, but far weaker than. in the morning; Laura's visit had been accom- plished and the letter delivered. Rosine gave Dr. Hartland his brother's letter at once, in answer. to inquiries for news from Aleck.' He made no remark as he returned the note to the half-filled envelope,: but there was a shade of severity on his brow as he divined immediately that there must have been an enclosure, and for Laura, and that it was intended to be secret, and worst of all, Rosine in :the secret. He did not offer to read to her, as he had done; :he spoke no. pleasant word, but went   The Fa ir.       45 away with only the directions of a physician. Rosine saw that he suspected her of sonlething underhanded, and it made her most miserable, filling her pillow with thorns, as she tossed about -wearily. Edward Hartland's suspicions once aroused, were not easily quelled. He was sure Laura had in- veigled Rosine into some plot of her own; he was vexed with Rosine for allowing herself any share in a mystery; he was sensibly annoyed by the remembrance that he was the one who had pro- moted the first intimacy between the girls; and puzzled as to what this evident secret could be, he determined, with the resolute will of a man seldom turned from his purpose; to ferret it out in some way. Rosine's illness was not of long duration; youth and a naturally good constitution were in her favor, and she was about -again in a few weeks, not in full health, for she was still languid and pale. The Colonel watched and tended upon her with the devotion of a lover, but Ned withdrew himself from all but necessary intercourse, omitted his kind brotherly ways, and  she felt that the dreadful secret which had brought her only misery was at the bottom  of this change. Laura's visits to the house grew less frequent: she dreaded the sharp eyes of the- Doctor as well as his blunt questions, and Rosine's eager request, whenever they met, that she would release her fron the bond of secrecy. But her rides and walks with Le Compte were not lessened; she-was seen With him everywhere, and it was rumored, by those 13   1:46      HawEhoriindean. who did, not ':know-- the man thoroughly, that he did at ,last mean to' marry,-and that Laura Marten was his choice. ' But she knew better; with her it was simply inordinate love of admiration and adu- lation which led her on, and his powerful influence which carried her forward even after she felt her danger; with him the plot was deep, the design dark, as we shall; see.    . /            .                  .   CHAPTER XII. CAPTAIN MARTEN COMES HOME, AND WHAT FOLLOWED. THANK heaven! Captain Marten's -ship is in the harbor," exclaimed Edward Hartland, as he came into dinner, ad-. dressing his father, who had just re- turned from his first drive with Rosine since her illness; "the honest old sailor will put an end to the goings on of Laura with Le Compte; she is positively the town's talk." "Silly moth," replied the Colonel, "-she will burn her wings this time; wont she?" "I hope so!" said the:Doctor impatiently, look- ing at Rosine. "She has given so many heart- aches, it is a pity she should not know how good it feels, if indeed she has any heart to ache." - "It appears to me, Ned, you excite yourself very unnecessarily about- Laura Marten," remarked Mrs. Hartland. "What do you care about her flirta- tions?" "Because I have a mother," he replied gravely, "and a sister," he added, bowing coldly to Rosine. : I cannot bear that any of their sex, especially one who has, as we may say, been one of our circle, should be found guilty of such disgraceful conduct." *'But would she marry this Le Compte," inquired "7   "8      Hawthorndean. the Colonel, "even supposing marriage to be his object?" "Marry the devil!" exclaimed his son, testily; "a pleasing prospect of repose must a woman have as the wife of such a man, with his amours and liaisons all over the country. No, he'll never marry wil- lingly. :Captain Marten is a downright honest man, and hates philandering. I should not wonder if Miss Laura were put under bonds to keep the peace." -"I haven't seen Laura for more than a week," said Rosine, as they arose from the table, making an effort toward a conversation with Dr. Hartland, which she had never been able to bring about since her illness. "It wouldhave been better if you had never seen her," replied he, in a sharp angry tone, turning away to the window.    - "Ned," said the Colonel, in a voice of authority; Awhy do you speak so to Rosa?  See, you have brought the tears to her eyes. I have noticed your ill-natured way of speaking to her of late. I'll not' have it.' "Rosine knows the reason very well," replied the. Doctor, taking no notice of his father's anger by- word, but leaving the room immediately. "Don't mind him, darling," said the Colonel, caressingly; "he is a crabbed fellow-a terrible early disappointment made him so."  The tears dropped- upon- the work which she had taken up. "He shall not bring his moroseness to trouble you," he. added, rising, "and I'll tell him so." "O, please don't speak to him about it," said   Captain Marten's Return.    I49. Rosine, drawing Colonel Hartland down by her side., "It is something in connection with Laura that makes him angry with me." ' He has no right to be angry with you on any account. I'll not have such ungentlemanly con- duct in my house!" "Please don't speak to him about it, father," she pleaded, using the paternal title as a sure pass- port to his heart, "it will pass over soon, and he will be as kind as ever." Only a few days went by before Laura came to pour out her heart to Rosine, and to say farewell. Somebody had been to her father with the tale of her misdoings, she was sure it was Ned. At any rate, Captain Marten had insisted upon her quitting Le Compte's society at once; this she found almost impossible, as he met her everywhere. Only the day before, her father while threatening to shut her in solitary confinement, saw Le Compte pass the window, bowing and kissing his hand to her, which so exasperated the old sailor that he bade her pack and be ready for her aunt's at once, where she should stay till she could behave herself and mind her father. She had tried, again and again, she said, and wept while she said it, to be rid of the man; she did not care for him; Rosine knew she was faithful to Aleck! The young girl looked up doubt- ingly at this assertion. "Truly I am," she reite- rated., "Le Compte knows of our engagement, and seems so perfectly to understand our position, that I really think it very old fogyish in my father to make such an ado about, nothing." She laid her head in her friend's .lap, and;wept heartily, 13*  '   150       awthorndeaen. wished she had never seen Le Compte, was afraid of him, and yet drawn towards him. "What should she do?" was her inquiry. Rosine begged renewedly that 'the secret might be-e made known at once to her father. "What, without Aleck to help her bear the consequences? No, never. Captain Marten would," she knew, "be more -indignant than ever."  Rosine summoned her {noral courage for a desperate venture; her timid nature would hardly have brought her to the step, but for the counsel and blessing of Father Roberts, which she had sought during her indispo- sition. Weary with the long contention between her will and conscience, she had at length sub- mitted to rightful guidance, and given the required promise that the intimate friendship should be given; up;-/and now when she was ready to yield, though Laura was as dear to her as ever, Provi- dence opened the way that made the effort she had dreaded for so many weeks comparatively easy. Once bring the rebellious will into a state of sub- mission to known duty, and myriads of obstacles that before seemed insurmountable, take flight directly. She told Laura decidedly that she could no longer be bound by the secret; she had sinned by her share in it, lost the Doctor's friendship, and was suspected of double-dealing, and She avowed her intention, if an. opportunity offered, of telling what she knew; she-thought it-would be better for- Laura as well as herself. Her friend was very angry, accused her of treachery and meanness, said it was - like all --Catholic priests, interfering' between friends. h-Rosine; in . her turn, incensed by'   Captain Martends Return.    151 the reflection on Father Roberts, re'criminated, charging Laura with using her as an instrument to her own ends, and in a moment of time the chain of friendship was ruptured between the two. The after-reflections of Rosine were not pleasant; they were a mingling of relief that a duty was done, and sore grief at the way in which it was accomplished. The consciousness of the wrong she had done both herself and Laura, in being the repository of her secret, deepened when she felt herself relieved of the obligation, and she determined no long time should elapse before she would unburden her mind to Dr. Hartland or the Colonel. She sat in the drawing-room alone the evening after Laura's departure. Colonel Hartland and his lady were out, and the Doctor, who since her convalescence had never sought her society, had gone to the library. The impression came upon her that now was her time, and coming where Dr. Hartland was smoking, his head thrown back, his feet in a chair, and his eyes shut, she said in her sweetest tones, a little tremulous, "Brother Ned, " may I speak with you?" =::" He raised himself and turned upon her one of his penetrating glances. "I have waited for you many days, Rosa," was his reply. "But you did not give me an opportunity," she said, seating herself on a footstool -by his side. "You have been offended with me, and never told me why." "Rosine,': he replied sharply, turning away from her as he'spoke, "you know very well the cause-   - I;532  M Hawzthorndean. of my displeasure-I should say my disappoint- ment. I thought when I met you, there was one of your sex who would not and could not deceive; but -when you lent yourself a tool to Laura Mar- ten's machinations, my confidence in you was shaken." "Edward," she said, hiding her face in her hands, - "I have done very wrong, but you are unjust to me. If I was a tool for Laura, it was an unwilling one, and I have- thrown off the yoke. I hope-it may be a lesson to me."          * - The Doctor laid by his cigar, and turning about again, he asked, ,' Rosa, do Laura Marten and Aleck correspond through you'?" "Yes. I knew I ought not to make a secret of it; his letters came enclosed in mine, but they arranged it without my consent, or even know- ledge. But that is not all," she continued, muster- ing courage from his more kindly manner, "there i is a greater secret which I obtained and kept very unwillingly; it has burnt in my heart ever since it rested there; they are engaged to be married." "Good heavens!" exclaimed'the brother, starting to his feet, almost overturning Rosine in his- ex- citement. "Engaged! Laura Marten engaged to Aleck! Her heart is blacker than I thought. But on the whole, it was fortunate perhaps that it was not a public engagement; after her course with Le Comrpte all other promises must be at an end, unnless a man's a fool! But now I think of it, Rosa, Aleck assured me only a day or two before he sailed that he' had ,no intention of marrying this woman.,   Captain Marten's Return.     5 3 "She wears a betrothal ring with their initials, and the motto,' Omnia vincit amor. " "Fools!" cried he impatiently. "Aleck will be charmed with my last epistle, in which I described the campaign of his affiancee with this scape-grace Le Compte. It will be a bitter pill if he cares for the worthless girl; but I'll risk their hearts," he added, lighting a fresh cigar, "such hearts as Laura's might love on continually,' the object still changing, the sympathy one,' to end of the chapter, without fear of cracking, much less of breaking. Do you call. that love, Rosa?" "It don't seem like it to me," she replied timidly., "I hope it never will, but at your age you can hardly be expected to know much about it. But never have a secret of this kind;" he added, laying his hand on her head; "young as you are, you are old enough to know that if this engage- ment had been made public in the beginning, Laura could not have gone1 on as she has; and I believe it was her plan to keep it secret, that she might flirt to her heart's content during Aleck's absence., Don't you see, my little one, that she was acting a lie?" "I do, I did see it," she replied earnestly, "it made me wretched, and I expostulated with her; indeed, I have hardly had a light heart since I have known it; her conduct seemed so wicked, it troubled me constantly to know that I was a party, in a way, to her untruthfulness." "'This trouble helped to make you ill, .and re- tarded your recovery. Rosa, you will be better, now you have told it. Never bear such another burden   154      Hawthorndean. while I am in'the land of the living. I shall tell Captain Marten of this, -that he may keep a strict, watch over his dutiful daughter, unless she finishes the plot by running off with Le Compte." Captain Marten was exasperated beyond measure  hi when Dr. Hartland made known to him   the    I secret off Laura's engagement. He cursed and swore roundly in true sailor fashion; said, "if - she hadn't more sense than to quit a nice young naval officer for this upstart adventurer, she de- served to be shut in a convent for the rest of her natural life:" and laid his commands with more force than ever upon the sister under whose care he had placed his daughter, not to suffer the girl to go out without herself for company. In this home of her aunt's Laura had only a few months before been swooed by Lieutenant Hart- land, and the associations of the present with the past made her reflections anything but agreeable. She was completely caught in her own net--she said repeatedly to herself that -she did not care for Le Compte, and she said truly, and yet she could not rid herself of him. She had never believed him more serious in the flirtation than herself; .he knew her engagement and correspondence, but he stHl pursued her with his attentions in a way that seemed to take it for granted that she was ready for his :company, and the first feeling of vexation with his presumption, scattered by his honeyed flattery, she found herself powerless. to resist. his will. She -remembered how Dr. Hartland had spoken of this will, which she found so powerful, so irresistable -and she was rather relieved when a   Captain Martens Return.    i55 third, in the person of her father, ordered her away from her enchanter. Mrs. Norris, the mistress of the fine estate to which Laura was banished, was a weak-minded person, unfitted to control and scarcely able to influence one with Laura's strong points of char- acter. She had been delighted with the little epi- sode in her usually monotonous life, which had brought her niece and the Lieutenant to her house, and though she scolded her for her imprudence, when the Captain entered into the details of her conduct with Le Compte, her eager questioning about the affair, when Laura was alone with her, manifested the truth that she, after all, did not see wherein her niece was so very much to blame. Captain Marten was called away by the duties of his ship, but he reiterated again and again his charges both to his sister and daughter. It was not long before Laura, with her attractive exterior, drew about her the young people of the neighbor- hood, and before many weeks she was engaged in a round of picnics, fishing parties, and moonlight rides, which drove Le Compte quite out of her mind. A set of tableaux were to come off, in which she was much interested, expecting to take part in these living pictures; but a sudden and severe cold, for which she was obliged to lay by for a week, prevented her assisting, except as a spectator;- even that was imprudent, as the physi- cian had forbidden her leaving the house. Many young people from town were to assist in the exhibition, and she did not resist the temptation to be present.            4   I56   .   ZIawthorndean. "Ah,:dear," said Mrs. Norris, in the second rising of the curtain for the striking piece, the Sultan and Sultana, " if-you were only in the place of that fair- haired, petite girl!" "But,- Aunt," Laura replied, "we will imagine hereto have been a Circassian slave; they are small and white,"               ' As she spoke, the next scene was announced, "The Game of Life.' Laura turned a look towards the stage and uttered a faint, cry, for in the per- ,son of the arch-adversary represented therein she recognized Le Compte. She pleaded faintness to her aunt, and almost unobserved she left the company and stepped to the veranda.   Fear, dread, attraction, interest, and repulsion, mingled in Laura's mind as she wandered down the pine walk to the broad river, which lay in the clear moonlight like a thing of life. She forgot her indisposition, her position, everything but the dreaded presence. At the last terrace, before reaching the stream, she paused; her quick ear caught the sound of a step behind her, her frame became agitated, the powerful unseen influence was near, she could not stir. But-in that moment she did resolve-,yes, her unpraying heart uttered one petition for help, and summoning all that remained of her naturally strong res0oution, she turned sud- denly upon Le Compte. "You should not have come here," she said, eagerly; "there has been enough of this; we must- part."  "You speak, ma chore, as if it were an easy thing to part," was the reply, in a low, melodious but   CUaplabfSln arten's Return . n o57 decided tone;. forever, too-it may be for you, but for me, after what has passed, impossible." Laura sunk into a garden-chair, while he-poured out his tale of love in no measured words, assuring her in terms that scorched her very soul, that he was in earnest, that a union as his wife, had from the first been his intention; this he asserted on his honor. "It can never be, Le Compte," replied, Laura; "you know it can never be. There are reasons--. Her voice seemed to come from a sepulchre, and she had not power to close the sentence. "Love conquers all obstacles," he said gently, yet firmly. "But it cannot obliterate former vows and promises," sobbed Laura, almost incoherently. "It does on my part, it may on yours; only say the word, and you are mine-mine forever." "Never! I will not!" cried she, resolutely, with- drawing her hand from his, and rising from her seat, she whispered in his ear. The words must have been of dreadful import, and they cut deep, for they caused him to -stamp his foot wrathfully, and brought a terrible oath to his lips; but the excitement was but momentary; his smooth, clear, polished voice was heard again, fearfully distinct in the ears of his trembling victim, as he said, "This need be no barrier to our happi- ness; you must fly with me; there is no time like the present; dancitng has commenced at the house, many hours must elapse. before we are missed, the silver moon smiles on our project, I will arrange the way." 15   158   -  . ]awthorndean. ?i: :.li e t:t closed ears. - ' Led captive at hi    d bi-fvisr  to^ Ladra's'mind as she re a!zed:.tiPe/ nature: :of his- proposals, backed as --she knew by a will which she had learned to dread. Nature gave way, and she fell senseless at his feet, as suddenly as if she had been smitten by his hand. Le Compte, for the first time in his life of intrigue, was baffled. Elopement had been his design ultimately, but his arrangements were not fully completed; with Laura yielding to his will, as ihew hadb anticipated after a brief struggle, he could" easily niake a way on the spur of the moment, but -with Laura itn a fainting fit, it was quite a difficult matter., He carried her to the water and tried all ithe means in his power to-restore her, unsuccess- fully, :He saw at length with the eye of a physician that, the trouble was more than a mere faintness, so bending: over her as she lay ghastly in the white moonlight, he muttered a fierce curse if she thwarted him, and returning to the house, the rumor was soon: spread through the hall by the servants, that Miss :Marten had stepped out for air, and fainted in th pine walk. The house was aroused, and Laura was conveyed to her aunt's, still unconscious, where she wandered for weeks amid the mazes of a brain fever. ;js oa/)  vb  t   r    CHAPTER XIII. OLD OCEAN VISITED, AND NEW FRIENDS FOUND. JHE  month of August had come, and Rosine, never fully recovered from -the spring campaign, was drooping. 'Dr. Hartland advised his father, who was overworked, to try sea-bathing for himself and -his daughter. Accordingly a small quiet farm-house was rented, adjoining one of the finest beaches ift the country, and a place of great resort for those seeking health or pleasure. Mrs. Hartland re- mained in town to keep house for the Doctor, wh6 could not leave his station during the most- un- healthy season. This retirement and freedom from care gave the Colonel an opportunity for nearer and more intimate acquaintance with the daughter who was growing daily into his heart. We have said retirement, and they were retired, although in the town a little more than a mile above them, multitudes sought not a place of rest and repose, but the occasion of displaying themselves and their appointments. The snug farm-house, ill- contrived and small, was selected by our friends for its freedom from company and its proximity to the beach, only a few barren acres-separating them 159   r6       Hawthorndean.  frc:ssthe-fcutL^ca e -Here, with only: a maid-servant, RSioride and heitdde:o onlfel' were 'fairly: domiciled'; hede  ladies he. would be bored to death with his company, she asserting that she wanted no other society To Rosine the sea in all its sublimity and beauty was a newly-opened volume, and she never tired of its study, gazing at the brilliant pictures, and perusing the unwritten pages with an ever new delight. Colonel Hartland gave her daily lessons in swimming, and in an incredibly short time the timid venturer, 'who scarcely felt secure when sup- ported-by a castout arm, would leap into the surf alone and- venture further than even her teacher thought- quite prudent. She soon learned the hours; when she could have a quiet stroll, meeting only--an occasional straggler, who, like herself, sought solitude.   Fromthe windows she loved to watch the fasshionables;who6 at set times came to the beach and donned their hideous dresses for, bathing, as well as the same fashionables when they came with their splendid turnouts for driving. The fine -horses were objects of admiration to both Rosine and:her companion, and though they did not bet on -the winners- in the race, they would always, in triue ; yankee fashion, give a "guess" as to the fojrtuniate one., - :; They ha&dbeen in- their -new quarters nearly two. weeklsw:hen;' they were surprised one evening by the;'"entrafice:-o f Dr. Hartland and his mother.  , i'?e have toemed' for the whole of to-morrow," said th'iDictorj , as Rosine -rushed to -the door to meet them, "and' perhaps longer," he added. "i'   Old Ocean Visited.     i-6i am driven to death, and as for mother, she can't live another day without a sight of the Colonel. I can go up town for lodgings, if yotf can't accom- modate me." "Of course we can," replied Rosine, "and I will see about dinner." "Dinner!" he exclaimed; "we attended to that vain affair in the mundane sphere from which we have just emerged; but hurry, Rosita, for I want you to show me the sea before the sun dips." She ran for her hat with delight "You really look better already, both you and father," said he, drawing her arm within his; "not a word have I heard, only business letters from father. I expected you to keep a journal for me, and tell me if you were disappointed in old ocean." . "Disappointed, Ned? Impossible! I can't say this beach reaches my expectations, but the sea- boundless, fathomless, sublime-all language seenims spiritless when speaking of its tmajesty." "Yes, Rosa, there is everything in it to excite wonder, awe, and admiration, but do you love it?" "Not exactly," she replied; "not as I do the dear brook at grandfather's, or the lovely Quine- boag that we see from Hawthorndean. I love it as I might the Empress Eugenie, or some great, far-off personage, not as I do the Colonel and my home, friends. Fear never leaves me when I look far off into its depths. I don't think I would like to live near it, but it makes me feel'how very little and weak I am; and I think,"--she added, reverentially, "it gives me grander thoughts of the Creator."                , "'   62     v .athlpormndean.- "Yes,-said--her companion, thoughtfully, "it must-inspire every thinking mind with the vastness off thiu-nfathoomable nature that could create such an. image of infinity; but I don't love it, I am free to,-say: it, has no charm for me; it is too changing and inconstant; it has shattered too many human hospes, and Iswept .so many dear ones into its unknown depths. -It is infinity without mercy.

It is antagonistic; not without cause, perhaps," he added, dropping his voice, and put- ting his hapd to his brow, as if to suppress some' painful emotion, "'for it covers in its depths the: dearest earthly -friend I shall ever know." . Rosine. let her hand slip into his with a gentle pressure, and said, "Tell me about it;" but he shook off the sudden sadness as instantly as it had came upon him, and continued the conversation in. his usual tone, as if nothing had occurred to dis- turb- him. '"Come, tell me, sister mine, are you happy here-? What do you find to do? Do you dive every day, and, has -the Colonel taught you to swim?", .." So. many questions!" replied she, in-a gay tone,. assistjng his effort to diSuise his emotion. "I will:  b:einvtwith-,the last; yes, we swim, and father and:, I take a dive every -morning before the gentry 7           ' *i   Old Ocean '-isited. -    i63 quit their beds," she added, disengaging her arm from his, and running forward to meet -the li'irii breaker, and scampering back agaii to:: escape a wetting. "Behave yourself, Rosa," cried the Doctor, lautgh- ing, as she barely escaped a ducking by giving a. great leap, "here are strangers coming. I wish- they'd staid away."  ;"O, nbo, replied she, eagerly, "these are rnot strangers. I meant to have told you of them; they are. Miss Greenwood-and her grandfather." The Doctor looked sharply- at her, turned instantly: upon his heel, and walked rapidly in another direc,-W tion. Accustomed, however, as Rosine was to -his sudden and hasty movements, this did not surprise her, and she continued, "They come out always for a walk'at this hour, the old gentleman 'is im- becile, has. almost entirely lost his mind, and she: devotes herself to him so assiduously--she is very: lovely.'  "Another sudden friendship!" said' the Doctor, pulling his cap over his brows, "and you -meant to' tell me of it- go on."  "I met her every day for several days, she with her grandfather, I with the Colonel, before we spoke; but 'one morning I wandered from him, and came upon her alone, her grandfather'waS sit- ting in a cleft of the rocks they call the Devil's Armchair;- she had been gathering sea-weeds and mosses, but never :where she b'ulId not"see him.

That's the way you scramble about, risking your neck for strangers," said the Doctor. "I shall advise the Colonel to keep with you here- after." "No -great risk, Ned, the tide was out; besides Miss Greenwood is so dignified and tall, I don't think she ever climbed a rock in her life. From that, time, which is four days since, we have met every day, twice a day." "Systematic, regular, and conscientious, I dare say, like everything Miss Greenwood does," replied he, in a tone slightly sarcastic. ",Do you know her, Ned?" exclaimed his com- panion, stopping in her hasty walk, and looking at him with surprise. , "I knew her once, Rosa," he said, in a tone changed to regret. "Yes," he added, making a . vain -effort to speak gayly, with something very like a smothered sigh, "I've known her all my life. Indeed, she was an old flame of mine in those days wheny                     ' f,(iWith sanguine cheer, and streamers gay  We cut our cable, launch into the world, And fondly deem each wind and star our friend.)

"A Catholic!" said Rosine with a start of surprise. "I'm so glad! Is she really? How came6 it about?" "That's a change since I knew her, but you may believe it was not from worldly motives, for by it she alienated many of her dearest Protestant Ifriends, exasperated the Commodore, more particularly I think because her brother Harry followed her'lead." "Why, is she Commn'odorerG-1een woo0d's daugh- ter!" again exclaimed Rosine. "I remember-," she paused, for her only memory of him was in connec- tioin with her father's disgrace. She blushed pain- fully, but the Doctor taking no notice apparently of her confusion replied, "Yes, Commodore Green- wood's only daughter, and a greater scamp than he was never suffered to live. I tell you, Dora Green- wood did not choose a path of roses, when she went against his will, and from what she at least thought was pure conviction, joined herself as her father said in his cruel bitter taunts, with the offscouring of all creation; (showed his stupid ignorance there.) After all, the old wretch is to be pitied, to be so disappointed in his children. Dora as good as dead, as he says; meaning thereby that she will never marry, and Harry in the navy, and hat- ing the service with such dislike, that he is only kept in it by obedience to his father's wishes. Ah, Rosa," he added sadly, pointing"far out to theI purple 'waves white crested, "the deep treach-e erous sea covers his' first-born, my :dearest friend- had he but lived; 'the saddest of words, it might have been.'"    :1466     Hawtlhorndean i Nothing was heard for a few moments but the \booming of the waters as they dashed against the ,rocks; at last Rosine ventured to speak, but veiry timidly. "'Why have I never heard of him?" Beca use I must not be sympathized with," lie ,said, turning about a little snappishy: "O, I forgot these," he added more mildly, diving down into his pockets- and bringing up two letters. She took them without a word; one was in the handwriting of Lieutenant Hartland, and she immediately broke the seal and gave the enclosure to his brother, simply saying, "-for Laura."' !'Poor Laura!'.' he ejaculated, "she has her death-blow, I fear." "O Ned," cried his companion, turning eagerly towards him," what do you-mean? Is she really so ill? We parted in anger; O, if I could but see her! Can I?" she-said, pleadingly. "There could be no satisfaction in an interview,'! he replied, "she is entirely oblivious to everything, raves continually of Aleck-it is fearful to hear her self-reproaches, and her pleadings for forgiveness, I was, called in consultation -and declined at first, but :could not resist the old Captain's entreaties. But I am wicked to tell you all this," he added, feeling her arm trembling violently, "let us sit here." They had come to a cleft in the huge roc'k, form- ing a seat shutting out everything but sky and sea. T,.his is the- Devil's Armchair," he -said, making Rosine sit down; '," I am glad his! majesty had it made- large .:enough for two," he added, seating- himself by her side.   Old Orean Viszted.     167 "Tell me just how she is, will you, Ned?" sobbed Rosine. "Don't distress yourself," he replied, "you shall know all I know. She has brain fiever of a most dangerous type; the physician in attendance has given her up; but I think she has a small chance yet, she has such a vigorous constitution, and a strong hold on life; but her'ravings;are horrible. To tell you the whole truth, this visit to Lau/ra nearly unmanned me, and was the chief cause of my leaving town; I was worked to death before, but this was the last ounce. If I had not left every- thing, I believe I should have been down myself." "Poor Laura! to die so!" murmured Rosine, her tears still flowing. "God reigns," replied the Doctor gravely, "and He has determined that as we sow we shall reap: it is a comfort that 'He is more merciful in His judg- ments than we are. But I am counteracting my own orders, and keeping you out after nightfall"; come," he added, wrapping .her shawl carefully about her, "don't fret' so about Laura, or I 'shall wish I had not come to tell you; cheer up and I will go to-morrow and fulfil, with you and mother for company, a duty too long neglected, and call on your new friend, now we can do so without fear of meeting the Commodore. I am glad for your sake you have made this friendship, it %will do you both good." Rosine's heart was too full for words/ Miss Greenwood and all were forgotten, in -he" ine thought of her early friend, her first fri'end,- lying- at death's door and she powerless to' help her by   l68     ,. Hawthorndean, word or deed. The other letter, which she still held unopened, claimed her attention when she reached the house. "What does grandpapa say?" said the Doctor, standing over her, a little anxious about the effect of his communication. .She had seated herself near the light, her hat still shading her eyes lest the Colonel should see traces of tears; but they came again as she read aloud in reply to Ned's question: "Willie is feeble, his general health is delicate and his eye-sight much affected; we wish Dr. Hartland could see him, but he is happy and cheerful as a lark." There was more; a little message'from himself, telling dear Rosa that he was much interested in learning his cate- chism, and preparing for his first communion, which she' did not read. "O, how 1 wish I could have him here!" she exclaimed, turning to Colonel Hartland, and then shrinking back as she observed Mrs. Hartland's eyes fixed upon, her with penetrating gaze, so like X Ned's, and yet so unlike; "I thought perhaps the sea-air might do him good," she added timidly. "The sea-air gets a-great deal more credit than it deserves, replied Mrs. Hartland, coldly. "Let her have him here," said the Colonel, look- ing towards his son. "The care of a feeble child I should think," continued Mrs. Hartland, "would not tend to benefit Rosine's health, and I always heard a sea- beach was the worst possible place for difficulties of the .eye; it might bring on blindnes3.at once." "I'li- tell you whaf we will do," said- the Doctor, after a few moments' thought; "when you and the ) .' '-*   Old Ocean  Visited.    1-T69 -Colonel get tired of each other, you and I will run up to Hawthorndean, and I will leave you there for a few days." ' "Thank you, Ned, that will be very pleasant," she said, almost with a sigh. Laura and her dear Willie mingled in her dreams that night, and the next morning found her looking, pale and dispirited. The Colonel reproached his son for keeping her out late at night, but Ned reproached himself for the true cause of her bad looks, and wished he had held his peace about Laura. He exerted himself to carry out hs- plan for a call on Miss Greenwood;, thinking that the making a new friend was the best way to help Rosine to forget the old one. His father wondered what could have brought his son so suddenly to a point for which he had been striving for years, and Mrs. Hartland assented to the proposition coldly and stiffly, the lady was never a favorite of hers. Miss Greenwood received her guests for- mally, as if it was quite- an unexpected event, hardly a pleasure, and took her seat by Rosine. Dr. Hartland- stood, after the first cold greeting, with his hands behind -him, gazing at the pictures which ornamented the walls of this private parlor of the Seagirt House, hazarding a word only now and then, till his eye caught a volume turned down upon the table, as if to be taken up and finished when they had gone; the title attracted him as he leaned over the table to get a nearer view of a wonderful copy of La Notte, by'Carl Maratti. He remembered to have seen it in his early days in Miss Greenwood's own home, and fearing to trust 15   1 70    i HaWthorndean. himself to gaze longer on what was so' full of memories, he took up the book and exclaimed, "Jane Eyre! I meet it everywhere."  That is an odd volume,' said Miss Greenwood, coloring slightly, as she addressed him, and their eyes met. "Harry purchased the-book when he was at home last, and he mislaid the other volume. I took this up while grandfather was sleeping, having heard it so often spoken of; but I have little time for such reading," she added, turning :away from the Doctor's fixed gaze. In parting, she begged the Colonel, between whom and herself the ice had rapidly thawed, to allow :her as much of Rosine's company as he could spare.', -"What a pity," said the Colonel, as they entered the carriage; "how I did long to kiss her and call her Dora, as I did in old times." No one replied to this remark, the truth was -slowly dawning upon Rosine that there had some time been something quite serious between the Doctor and Miss Greenwood, and she was afraid to speak, lest she might say something that would hurt his feelings. "I have found out' your secret, Rosa, during this call," said the Doctor, when he found conver- sation flagged, and wishing to turn the thoughts of the company in another direction. "It is very funny how things will come about. I could swear, if I ever did such a wicked thing, that that volume of Jane Eyre on Miss Greenwood's table is fellow to the one left on the flower-table, and that Harry Greenwood is Rosa's 'gentleman;"'   Old Ocean Visited.     17I "You don't really know?" inquired Rosine, her interest excited. "I should be glad if he were Miss Greenwood's brother. Is he like her?" "Yes, not unlike Dor--his sister; the same woq- derful eyes-and--Harry's a fine fellow and a gen- tleman, a little stiff like his sister about matters of propriety." There was slight sarcasm creep- ing into his tone, and the Colonel took it up at once by saying, "Dora's a pattern woman! Look at her devotion to her grandfather, it is something beautiful, and so in contrast with the manners- of the present age, when old folks and children are left to the care of servants. I have certainly never- seen any one like her." "She - intends becoming a Sister of Charity after his death, I hear," said Mrs. Hartland. The Doctor fidgeted, the Colonel did not reply, and the remainder of the ride was a silent -one. Mrs. Hartland expressed her doubts that evening to her son, as to how the Commodore would regard a friendship between his daughter and Rosine. "You know, Ned," she said, "-Mr. Benton was the cause of his pecuniary losses." "Even the cantankerous old rascal could not find fault with the girls for loving each, other," replied the Doctor, "arbitrary and domineering as he is." The call brought Rosine and her new friend nearer; and after the Colonel: and she were again alone, each day brought the girls together, and the grandfather becoming accustomed to Rosine's pre- sence in their walks -their intercourse was often prolonged through many hours. Miss Greenwood   172      Hlawthorndean. would seat her parent comfortably in the camp- chair, where he could see the sun shining on the waves, and feel the sea-breeze playing with his long white locks, and above all, watch the girls as they walked up and down the beach, never out of sight or out of reach of his call. The fair had one day been brought incidentally into their conversation, and Rosine had related her adventure at the flower table, with the Doctor's surmise that she was indebted to Miss Greenwood's brother as her protector. "We can soon tell if Harry were the fortunate man," said her companion, pausing in her walk; and taking a double locket from her bosom, she touched a secret spring and placed the trinket in the young girl's hand. "Is it like that gentleman?" she said, smiling. "I should know it anywhere!" exclaimed Rosine. "I am so glad." "So am I," said her friend, drawing her arm within her own as they continued their walk; "you must know Harry when he comes home; he's a noble fellow.' "Where is he now?" inquired Rosine. "He is on a cruise to the Mediterranean. There is talk in the Department of a recall of the squadron with which he sailed, to join the forces the govern- ment propose to send against Mexico. I think if it comes to this, it will decide my brother at once to leave the service for which he already has no fondness. Such an unjustifiable war! I pray Jesus and our Holy Mother to save him from shedding blood in such a cause."   Old Ocean  Visited.    I73 Rosine made no answer, her eyes were riveted on the locket, when, as if by magic, the reverse side of the trinket sprung open. "O, how beau- -tiful! how lovely!" she exclaimed, pausing. sud- denly in her walk and looking to her friend for an explanation. The picture was of a youth apparently about twenty, glowing in the first flush of manly beauty, and with an expression that won the heart at once. Miss Greenwood took the locket in her own hand and murmured, "Yes, dear, lovely, beautiful beyond comparison; and taken so young, so suddenly, and so-," her voice died away in a sob. She walked away from her friend, her eyes cast down, her step rapid. Rosine remained where she had left her, wondering in her own mind if this could be the 'first-born' of' whom -Ned had once spoken-then came the wonder, why this intimacy between the two families, which must have been very strong, had never been known to her. She tried to recall any allusion to them, but could only remember- hearing Aleck once wish Harry Greenwood were at home, and the Colonel had spoken sometimes quite severely of the Commodore, but of Miss Greenwood and the lost brother, she had never heard till she had herself made her acquaintance. Rosine was awakened from her reverie by the return of her friend, all traces of the- late deep emotion effaced, and her-countenance wearing the calm, placid, somewhat pensive look, that usually rested there.' She informed her young companion that she had met the Colonel on the beach looking for her. Rosine made- haste to meet him, he 15*   x'74      iHiawthorndean. coming towards her holding a letter high- above his head, exclaiming "From the west!"Imme- diately, as she 'aw her father's handwriting, her heart sunk within her. "I know there is bad news," she said, out of breath with her run, and looking pitifully into his face.' "Shall I read it for you?" he inquired affection- ately, and placing the camp-stool for her and bid- ding her lean against him, he read aloud, not -without -some hesitancy and choking on his part, the sad story of little Jeannie's release and Mar- ion's wanderings and consequent illness. It was written-in the terse, laconic style of a man of busi- ness; but in the end he said, "I thank God, my child, that you are exempt from the hard discipline we are enduring in this to Uis foreign land, and are sheltered in the home and heart of one worthy of the love of such a daughter." "But I ought to be with my mother," she said, looking up at Colonel Hartland; "she needs me -now more than ever." "But, my darling child," replied he, "in your present delicate state, lately recovered from a ner- vous fevelr, you could be but little assistance." "I could comfort her," she said sadly. "0, here is something from your mother," he exclaimed, as he turned the last page. "Do not be impatient or unreconciled, my be- loved Rosa. The dear Lord will watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another, and bring us together again. I miss you hourly, my sweet comforter, now more than ever; but I would not have, you pine for me; you have with me,   Old Ocean Visited.     I75 the sweet, company of the saints, and they will bring you comfort with their prayers; we have now a new advocate in Heaven, and dear Jeannie will never forget to pray for us. The little picture of St. Rose is near me, and I never look at it with- out a petition for my sweet Rosita."  The intelligence contained in this letter weighed on Rosine's health and spirits; she solaced herself somewhat by a full outpouring of her heart to her mother, which she could now do without oversight; confessing to an ever-present yearning for her dear embrace. She did not pine or complain, but as- sured' her parents that she had learned to love Colonel Hartland's family very sincerely, she would be always happy but for the great distance from those best loved. Dr. Hartland exclaimed, on his next visit to the seaside, upon Rosine's ill looks. '-'She had gone back," he said, "to where shg was before she left town, and if this was the effect of the sea-air, he should order her at once into the interior." "How is Laura?" was her first- question. "Very bad," replied he. "I saw her physician' yesterday. He says the disease is gone, and the delirium, but her mind seems to be in a state of collapse." He- would not say more of Laura, but turned with interest to the collection of mosses, shells, and other sea treasures she had gathered during her sojourn by the beach, and which Miss Greenwood had. promisedto come the next day and arrange for her in their rightful places, before they were carried to' the city. The, next day passed without the appearance:   17 6      HaWmthornmdean, of Miss Greenwood either at the house or on the beach; but'the Doctor only shrugged his shoulders when Rosine wondered at this non-fulfilment of her promise. The day after his departure Miss Green- wood made her first appearance at the farm-house. She found her young friend quite alone, the Colonel having gone to town on business prepara- tory to their going away, which was to take place the next, week. 7 With busy pliant fingers she soon made order in the confused mass of marine curiosities which Rosine -had collected, telling her as she laid each one in its place, how much she should miss her cheerful face in her daily walks, and how she had come to love her very dearly. She blushed deeply when Rosine ventured to hope they might meet ,in the city. "My dear child,' she said at length, "this little green spot in my life will never be forgotten. I live, very quietly, but perhaps you will sometimes come to the Navy Yard to see me. Mind, I shall, mark that day with a white stone that brings you; but you will have younger and gayer companions." '"I haven't any- gay companions now," replied Rosine, smiling sadly. "I don't think I want any." : "That is hardly a natural wish for one so young and hopeful as yourself, and with so many looking to you for comfort." "Looking to me for comfort!" replied Rosine, opening her eye's in astonishment. "Yes; all looking to you for comfort," repeated her friend. "From the gleanings I have gathered from you in our happy hours, and from my own   Old Oceaun Visited.     1" heart being so drawn to you, I know that many hearts are trusting to you for comfort. Y our own 'dear mother first, whom you have made me love; your sister, your brothers, but more particularly' just now, Colonel Hartland's family. The Colonel's heart is evidently set upon his newly found daugh- ter. Good, noble man! He only wants one thing, to make him nearly perfect; but that is the greatest want. You- know what I mean-a religious spirit, To you, dear Rosa, this blessing has been given in large measure. O, if you could impart of it to others! Then, there is the absent Lieutenant, his letters manifest his dependence, his deference for you. Then Laura, poor foolish child, some time you may be able to do something for her:" she paused a moment. "Have you forgotten Ned?"' said Rosa, smiling, willing to change the subject from Laura. "That is hardly possible in a review of the family. If you can persuade Edward Hartland to care for his soul,"-she paused,--"unbaptized even!" she exclaimed, with-something like a groan. "O, Rosa, it is dreadful to see our friends living in the neglect of this first duty, without which-" "The Doctor is a great deal older and wiser than I," said Rosine, timidly, "and influences me, but I don't think I can influence him."' "Influence is mutual necessarily. -Dr. Hartland has nearly lost his faith in woman, and faith in God is very apt to follow. A sister, a younger sister, trusting, conlfiding, actuated by firm religious faith and right principles, must help him mightily; but I am foolish to allow myself to talk thus," she added,   I78:     zHawtzhorndean. rising .to go. .

' Don't call me Miss Greenwood, my sweet one; call me Dora, or Miss Dora, if you like it'better. I wish you were my sister," she said, returning the affectionate caress. In a few days Colonel Hartland and Rosine were on their way to the city, and the following week Dr. Hartland fulfilled his promise, and she found herself quietly settled at Hawthorndean, the home of her grandfather; enjoying the fresh breezes from the -hillsides, drinking in life and health, both for soul and body. Dr. -Hartland could leave his post but for one day, but he would return for her by and by, and for the fishing excursion he had promised himself.   CHAPTER XIV. CONVALESCENCE. $i1^ ' HYSICALLY, Laura Marten was slowly &I iPJ recovering, but her mind appeared to be still overshadowed with a heavy cloud. From the first dawn of returning intellect she had missed from her finger the ring of her betrothal; the loss was like a continual fire eating into her heart, for she had instinctively divined into whose possession it had fallen. She spoke of the loss to no one; within, the thought dwelt con- tinually, and her friends sought, without success, to cheer her spirits; she did not rally, she showed no interest in any thing, but seemed constantly search- ing for something which she could not find. The first thing that aroused her in the least, was the letter from Lieutenant Hartland, which the Doctor had forwarded as soon asRosine had given it to him.  It was held back by her father at first, lest it might excite her too much, but when day after day went by and there was no change, it was resolved to try what effect the letter would have in arousing her from her apathy. Accordingly, one September morning, as she was seated in the invalid's chair, drawn toward the eastern window that she might have the influence of the early sunlight, and the 179   I8o     ?lawthorndean. prospect' f the lovely scene that nature spread before "her, Captain Marten entered with the Lieu- tenant's letter in his hand. She did not turn her head to greet her father, but continued to gaze down the long avenue of pines, that brought such fearful memories. An intense melancholy pervaded every feature; twice her name was called ere she gave a look of recognition. The rough old sailor was softened by trouble, and his voice wavered as e said in a tone meant to be jolly, "Laura, ducky, are you ready for a line from the Commodore that is to be, I mean .Aleck 'Hartland?"There was no change in the stony expression of her face, and not a spoken word as she held out her hand for the letter. The Captain was at a loss to know if he should leave her alone with her treasure, but she settled that matter by a wave of the hand that indicated her wish.- As soon as the door closed she kissed the precious missive overand over again, pressed it to her heart, laid it in her lap and wept over it, till after many minutes with trem- bling fingers she ventured to break the seal and read-- ON BOARD THE X---, OFF CADIZ, July -. "MY PRECIOUS ONE: "1A letter from Ned last night exasperated me; and I was so like a madman that I only escaped reprimand from the Captain by pleading illness. Your letter came after it, like healing balm to my spirit. I could not doubt your love; in spite of Ned's malicious hints, I have perfect confidence in you. It would be dastardly in me to' wish tc   Convalescencec.     I8r deprive you of gentlemen's society during' my; absence; I leave my honor in your hands with unwavering trust'." At these words Laura uttered a shrill, piercing cry, that soon brought her father, her aunt, and most of the servants to'her room; she struggled for composure, but a fearful paroxysm of hysterics was not to be avoided. She grasped the letter. convulsively, and it could not be taken from her without tearing it into fragments. Hours passed before the physician could calm her agitation, and weeks b'efore she could-again sit at the window and gaze down the pine. walk. Who can doubt that He that miarketh the sparrow's fall, guideth the steps of his dear ones? Sister Agnes. was called at this time on an errand of mercy to- a charity child, in the very house where Laura was ill. It was a balmy sunny day, such as the closing hours of September often bring to charm us with a remem- brance of the past, when Laura heard the gentle tones of Sister Agnes' voice, as she interrogated Mrs. Norris with regard to the orphan. 'Bring her here"' said Laura to the servant'in attendance; "I must see her, I cannot wait, ,she' will help me, bring her here now-I can't wait."' Her manner was hasty and imperious. After a short consultation below, the good sister was con- ducted to the room of the invalid, followed by Cap- tain Marten and Mrs. Norris. "All of you go," said -Laura; "I wish to see Sister Agnes alone, and I don't wish to be inter- rupted:" They obeyed reluctantly' her father whispering   '82     - hzawthorndean. to:the'sister as he went out, "The poor thing is not 'quite like herself." "Please lock the door, and sit here/' said Laura, pointing to a chair beside her own. Sister Agnes did as she was requested, and took Laura's hand- affectionately. "I'm sure you don't know how wicked I :am, or you would not have come near me"' whispered the sick girl. "Our dear Lord did not spurn the chief of sinners, and He will not turn away from us," replied she, pressing the hand she held. "I've been thinking of that," continued Laura, her eyes brightening a little. "He let that poor woman'wash. His feet, that's what I'd like to do." "My child, if that is your wish, He welcomes you to His arms." : "But I can never repair what I have done," she said, relapsing into the dull, care-worn look. "I can -never restore lost confidence." "We must leave results with the same Blessed One who -loves us and cares for us more than any human .being can possibly do." "O, but you don't know all," sighed Laura, and hastily putting out her hand, as if afraid of a tempta- tion to draw back, she took a jewel-box from a drawer near by, and searching in it with trembling fingers, beneath a heavybracelet, she brought out a slip:of paper, and placed it unopened in the hand of her friend. "Tell me,"' she said, in a hollow voice, ";what you: think of one who after that, could throuigh: vanity and love of admiration, be so un- faithful as to have offered to her the insulting alter- native: of elopement-withl anothei?"For a moment   Convalescence.     I83 her eyes flashed wildly, and her face flushed crim- son. "Love of admiration! ,vanity! she solilo- quized, taking a hand-glass from the table and looking at herself, "there's nothing tolcall them forth now." She was indeed changed; the heavy braids of ler long raven hair were gone, her head shaven and covered -with a close cap; her bright, healthful color replaced by sallow paleness; her eyes, once so lustrous and fascinating, were dull and heavy with disease, the plump, finely rounded figure emaciated and the quick, brisk manner changed for an inar bility to move without assistance. Sister Agnes carefully read the paper, while the. sick girl made these comments upon herself. There was a look first of surprise andwonder, then of sadness and distress, as she closed the paper, giving it again to- Laura without comment, "You agree with me," said the invalid, after waiting for her companion to speak, "one can hardly hope, after such misconduct." "Out dear Father is more merciful than man," replied Sister Agnes, slowly. "He forgives and restores us to His favor, but He does not assure us of the. pardon of our fellow-men, or that we shall escape the temporal disgrace and suffering we may have brought upon ourselves. -A full Confession :of our faults to those we have injured is necessary to our peace."        - "Will you help me, guide me; and -keep me?" exclaimed Laura, pitifully, clasping - her hands. "All that is not for human power alone, dear," she replied, "but I Will do all I can: for you.: -ear   Ji84   -  Hawfhodrdean.

There was but one thought living in ;her':soul,: one; feeling that overcame and trampled outi everyy other emotion-how she should take the next' step.' The'-lonely hours brought. her no peace, ahnd her aunfts conversation became odious to her. At:i length, with a desperate struggle, she took the 'first step 'in the right direction; she wrote a long letter to Lieutenant Hartland,' confessing every   Convalescence.      185 thing but the last interview with Le Compte, and the loss of the betrothal ring. With all her strug' gles she could not bring herself to tell of this, it was such a mortifying incident) She was sincere and truthful as far as she went, but she kept back that which was doomed to bring her. severest- punishment, and which, truly confessed, would have been forgiven with the rest  The effort she made, although  it was not a thorough one, benefited her mentally and physi- cally; but a, dreadful fear of Le Compte, which had come   upon her so forcibly-in her illness, continued in all its force. His presence seemed to haunt her, and not without reason, for she had learned from  months of almost daily inter- course, that he did not readily give up the pursuit of any object. No sooner was she able to appear below stairs,: and her father well out of the -way, than a little: messenger appeared each day with boulquets of. flowers for "Miss Marten," from   an unknown source; soon words of love were found among the leaves, betraying at once, if before there had: been any doubt, from whence they came, Mrs.: Norris spoke of the "delicate attention," and : kind thoughtfulness " of the donor, professing to wonder who he could be; but to Laura these tokens brought added pangs of head and -heart, till one day, summoning resolution, she-met the: carrier of the flowers, and ordered him to return them:to' the one who sent them. Mrs. Norris was :indig-- nant:. with this step.          :   - "Aunt," said Laura, after that lady -had ex- I16   8 6      fawthlorndean, pressed her feelings, "you ought to be the last to tempt me further in the ways of sin. Flirting and coquetting have brought me sorrow enough. I wish' to :be done with them." : She did not dare leave the house even for a stotl in tle:garden, an invisible influence told -her the enemy was not far away, and September went out with its last golden sunshine, leaving her still a close-:prisoner within doors. Her father came up for a few days, and she begged most piteously that she niight return to the city witl+ him, but the physician had advised her remaining in the country as long as possible; she. did not open her heart to her father, or he would have better understood .her pleadings. She sat gazing from the windows of the, draw- ing-room to the blue hills in the distance, the day afterr his departure, wishing she had: the wings of a dove and could flee away and be at rest, wonder- ing ;ifshe had any one who really cared for her; remembering Rosine and her sweet. love that had brought her so much pleasure, with a sting of sorrow in the end, as she recalled her own harsh unjust words, when a quick ring at the hall door startled" her to her feet. "It :is a stranger," said her aunt, bustling in; "a very courtly looking gentleman. I saw him drive up the avenued." Laura flew, instantly to her own room, and bolt- ing the entrance, threw herself on the, floor. "It is he,'! she whispered; , I know it, I feel it! Detest- ing him as I do, there is an influence that almost- forces me- intod his'presence."   Coinvalescence.-      87 She was not mistaken, it was Le Compte, who inquired very respectfully for Mrs. Norris, not being willing to take the word of the servant as to Miss Marten's health. The lady received him rather stiffly, but skilful flattery. soon won her; she was sure there could not be any thing very bad in a young man so respectful to his elders. He, expressed no hope of seeing Laura then, but he would call again. Mrs. .Norris sought her niece after this interview, and found her almost wild with excitement. Her face became livid as-she listened to her aunt's eulogiums upon the manners5 of the gentleman, and his delicate inquiries for her health; but when she came to his promise to call again, Laura spoke in a terrible voice: "Aunti shall never leave this room till my father comes to take me away. Do you know that viper?" she exclaimed vehemently, striding across the floor; "that wretch was the whole cause of my  illness; his insulting proposals nearly shattered my brain, and he keeps me   as truly imprisoned here,'as if a band of soldiers surrounded the house with that design. I will not change my purpose," she added, as her aunt begged her to be calm  and recon- sider, "I will not see him, I will not communicate with him, and if he comes, tell him what I, say." Mrs. Norris, frightened by her excited and positive manner, dared not expostulate further, lest she should bring on the delirium of her illness; but her fear left her before the next call of- the tormentor, and she excused Laura on the plea of health not- sufficiently restored to meet any o ne out of her family.   8og8     H tawthorndean. in his.biandeatl/manner, giving into her hand a dainty note.

INGLEWOOD. URING Rosine's visit to Hawthorndean, which we have mentioned in a previous chapter, a letter was received by Colonel Hartland from Mrs. Benton, a letter writ- ten during her husband's severe illness; it asked advice in view of the physician's expressed opinion that Mr. Benton's constitution could never endure the labor of farmn life in that climate. To whom could she so readily turn for counsel as to him who so sacrificed himself for them in -their ex- tremity. "Bad news?" inquired Mrs. Hartland, as she heard the exclamation when the Colonel read the letter, and saw the flush that passed over his face. "I must go west," he said decidedly; "Philip Benton will kill himself and all his family." "What has he done now?" asked his wife. "He has congestive fever, and is nearly dead. I must start to-morrow." "But why should you take the whole Benton family upon your shoulders, husband; you surely have already done more than could be expected." 189   190      Hawthortzdeam. He who presumes to friendship's namo Reckons himself and friend the same," replied the Colonel, smiling "'No; but' really, Alexander, you have done a great deal," she said somewhat urgently. "And hope to do a great deal more. Poor Benton! Can you get me ready by to-morrow," he added, "to be gone-well, two weeks? My leave will not expire till two weeks from Saturday, which will give me time to go and come." Mrs. Hartland knew that further remonstrance from her--would be useless, and she desisted from further argument. "But, father, you will not go without a sight of Rosine, or a message from her to her own people; it will break her heart when she hears of it," said :Dr. Hartland, running over the letter which his father had put into his hand. "Id rather she did not know, how badly off they are there," replied the Colonel, "and she might want to go with me." "That, of course, is out of the question," said the Docthr, " for she would never care to come back, and we can't any of us spare her now. She will 'not- ask to go unless you propose it; and you can soften the matter as to Mr. Benton's illness, and make the government an excuse for the journey. I know you can find something to do for the Depart- ment on your way."' "Thank you, Ned, for the suggestion. I'll go," he said, rubbing his hands with delight at the thought of meeting Rosine; he was pining for her, although only separated for a few days.    ' mngleood. -dt Thus it came that: he journeyed .many miles out of' his way before turning his, face westward, and carried many messages of love from Rosine to her dear ones, without leaving on her mind :any of the- / anxiety he was feeling lest he should', not find his friend Benton among the living. Colonel Hartland reached kthlacca readily, and found Horatio Leighton in the post-office as he inquired the way to Mr. Benton's farm.   The young man piloted the stranger to the Prairie Home, and was a witness to the delightful reunion of tried friends. All Philip Benton's reserve Vanished with the Colonel, and he was once more a boy, he -opened his whole heart, and was the better for it. Marion accompanied her father's friend to St. Louis, whither he was bound, and sought out Harold, whom they found diligently pursuing his studies, determined to be first in his profession, with the avowed object at some future day of making a home for his parents, where they could live without labor; this was the. golden vision for which he worked day and night. The Colonel was delighted with him, and expressed his admiration to Father Cote, upon whom he called with Marion. "He isa splendid fellow.' I shouldn't wonder if he were President of the -United States yet." "O, i  hope not," replied the 'venerable priest; his soul would be risked at the, White House. He  is terribly ambitious, now for' a good object; but I  often have to remind him, with the good Kempis, that 'man propbses, but Godly disposes.' He has a noble object, and I get really enthusiastic   x I92     Haawthorndeoan. myself when he talks of his blessed mother, and wliat hle will do for her." "God spare him' to fulfil his purpose," replied the Colonel. "Amen!" was the hearty response. Before leaving Athlacca, Colonel Hartland had made. arrangements for securing the office of post- master .for his friend, and had bought a pretty cabin in the timber adjoining the growing town, only a short distance from Mrs. Leighton. Here he desired his friend to locate himself. Horatio Leighton made a ready sale of the.- prairie farm at a pric' farh beyond its original cost, owing to the increasing' tide of emigration brought to Athlacca by the prospect of a railroad through its boundary' and the discovery of an extensive coal-bed within its borders. The interest of this sum, with the annual stipend from Mr. Hawthorn to his daughter, enabled them to live in that land of plenty with comfort.  The night before the Colonel was to return to the east the conversation between- him and his friend was prolonged far into ----the small hours, although Mrs, Benton from the inner room assured her husband he would make himself ill again; the, two friends seemed like lovers loath to part. "I cannot but hope, Philip," said the Colonel, as he rose for the third time to say "good-night;" "'that the time may come when you and your -family may live in the east again; it is too bad to throw them away here." "f East'!" replied the other with almost a groan; "for them I wish they might, but -for me, never.   I'ng/ewood.       193 I hoped it would please the good Lord to take me to himself in this illness. O, Aleck, it is a dreadful thing for a man to come to feel that his family would be better off without him." "Don't name it, Phil," said the Colonel, seating himself again; "think of Lucy, how desolate. she would be without you. Better off! Why I tell you she would not survive you long. What ax woman she is!" "You may well say that, but you don't know- half she has been to me; but, my noble, my., generous frieAd, when that time comes, as I hope it will, then may she look to you as I have, Aleck?" Colonel Hartland did not trust himself to reply, but he gave his hand to his friend in token of hearty assent. He wished to stay to see them out of that "lonesome, windy, grassy place," into the snug haven in the woods, but not being his own man his time was limited; he- kissed Marion in parting, and told her that he should have her to pass a winter with her sister before long, and went away leaving light and good cheer in the Prairie Home. Rice came over to assist in packing and remov- ing, which was to be done immediately. He had been constant in his kindness to the family during the illness of Mr. Benton, and had at length won his respect for his sterling worth, so that now, when they met there was a kindly recognition of obligation on the part of the once proud Philip Benton, for the services of his rough-hewn-neigh- bor. Mr. Benton was still too feeble to make any 17   : ,94      -zawlthaorndean. arrangements for leaving the one place, and occu- pying the other; and Colonel Hartland, who had taken a special fancy to young Leighton, had en- gaged him to attend to everything, particularly the broad-ploughing around the farm, which was neces- saryin those days to save it from the devastations of the usual autumn fires. The men employed had finished the work only the day before they were to move, the last thing was packed, and Marion was playing a tune preparatory to boxing ,the piano; Horatio Leighton standing on one side, Mr. Rice with hammer and nails and eager listen- ing ear on the other, when Sobriety rushed into the house, her eyes fairly snapping with light; "Uncle Sam's farm's afire!" she exclaimed. There was a general rush to the door, to witness that grand and awful sight so wonderfully set forth to the life, by our own able countryman in his des- cription of prairie scenes.  "Pears it's like that day Miss Marion read me about in the book," soliloquized Sobriety. "How very fortunate," said Marion, turning to her father, "that the ploughing was finished around the fence." "Providential, my dear," replied he gravely, "but for it, we should have been beggared; to say the least.", "It come near makin' a mess on yer," exclaimed Rice, who had gone out, and now came running round the corner of the house. "Here, you young- ster,"- he added, addressing Leighton, there's work for us."- The young man did not answer the call at once, and it was repeated. "I say, youngster,   - Infgfaood.      ig95 stir your stumps or you may burn up, pretty goal and all, don't you see the fencin is took." Leigh- ton rushed to 'the door at this ann'0uncemeint, "Here," added Rice, "get up behind and give us a lift at fitin fire." But Sobriety was-before .h im and had jumped upon the horse behind Rice, and away the two went, careering over the fields to where the fence was beginning to burn. pneed there was need of haste; the clouds of flame and smoke were coming down upon them like an army with banners, leaping over the furrows, and with their forked tongues catching here and there the spires of long rank grass between the sods that had been ploughed, curling about the dry fencing, and bounding through it to reach the stubble within. The dull lurid light spread over earth and sky, giving to the faces that gazed on this wonderful sight its own terrible hue. In a moment Leighton was mounted and going in another direction where the danger was equally threatening., The three worked rapidly, pulling down the fence and cover- ing the already ignited rails with- fresh ploughed earth, beating and literally fighting fire till the flames swayed in a different direction, when they returned, much wearied and blackened by their exertions. "But for your timely help, my kind friends," said Mr. Benton, giving a  hand to each of the men, "everything must have gone before this 'destruc- tion that wasteth at noonday.'" In a  few days the family were settled at Ingle- wood, the name which Marion had given to- their new home. Mrs. Benton's heart leaped with thank-   fulness as she strolled under the protecting arms of the broad centennial oaks and familiar maples, and in their friendly shelter she rejoiced continually. Marion,, too, was happy, gladdened by her prox- imity, to Alice Leighton. They were near neigh- bors, and that day must be indeed dark and stormy that, did not bring a meeting between some mem- bers of each family. The remove brought them near the physician who had so skilfully carried Mr., Benton through his dangerous illness, and whose- advice had brought them  to their pre- sent home. A promising, cultivated gentleman, brought to Athlacca by his attachment to the Cath- olic Church, could not fail to be an object of interest to both Mr. and Mrs. Benton, and with him had arrived the faithful- pioneer missionary, whowas earnestly spending-himself for that object to, which he had consecrated his life. A church had,'sprung up as if by magic, and Mrs. Benton no longer mourned the absence of the Holy Sacri- fice. , Between Dr. Nelson and Mr. Benton had grown a wonderful intimacy, commencing with the con- fidential intercourse of the sick-room. The sensi- tive shrinking from strangers which had marked Mr. Benton since his sojourn in the west, had given way' before the modest worth of Dr. Nelson. It was a study, a most pleasant study, for the wife to, note the progress of this friendship between her once 'proud, cold, haughty husband, and such a manly, Christian heart. The physician was one of those' rare spirits who have no rough corners, or rather whose rough corners have been rounded   ngooa  .       !97 by the discipline of a hard life. With great natural reserve and a quiet, unobtrusive nature, he had a soul: that was always prompt to do right-sensitive and sympathetic as a woman, without any touch of weakness. His inner life flowed on like a noiseless stream hidden from view, and betraying its exist- ence only by the fresher verdure springing up in its course. Though a young man, for he had not reached thirty, his experience gave him the wisdom  of added years; born to wealth and worldly hopes, his life had, since his orphanage at the age of fourteen, been one continued struggle with adverse circumstances; his father's riches faded before the wind of a terrible financial crisis, and he died leav- ing his wife and two children with a  very small pittance for their support. The wife had soon fol- lowed her husband, and now Dr. Nelson stood in the world without the claim of kindred with any person save his sister, Philomena, whom, out of his own earnings, he supported at the Convent of the Ladies of the Sacred Heart. Mrs. Benton felt a  motherly care for, tle young man, and longed to help him when he made light of the serious inconveniences of a  life among a rude people, like the population of Atlhlacca. He had built his small cabin not far from Inglewood, and the grateful heart of Mrs. Benton could not resist the temptation of bringing man y little com - forts to his bachelor's  hall, which only a  woman knows how to provide. After the removal, all his leisure was spent with his friend, Mr. Benton, who never seemed to tire of his     young  companion.  1:98     ]Hawthorndean. His extensive. knowledge of men and things, aided the young man in his profession; while Dr. Nel- son's guileless devotion to his faith, and his cheer- ful, contented waiting on God, afforded to Mr. Ben- ton the example he most needed, that of a manly Christian.         .  Marion was fast becoming identified with Athlacca society, she was the leading mind, and she at once took her position as the first young lady in the growing town. In Sunday-school, in works of charity, in decorations of the new church and the altar, she was conspicuous everywhere. She had great success in removing prejudice against the Catholic Church, and she was equally successful in impressing upon her friends her importance in more worldly matters. Good Father Sheridan, the faithful pioneer priest, called her his right-hand man. Emigrants of the better class came flocking into the town, and houses began to dot the prairie in all directions. A new brick court-house to mark the county town, sprung up near the church, the law and the gospel working side by side. Alice Leighton appeared to be regaining her health' sl6wly but steadily, perhaps from the skill of Dr. Nelson, who had been consulted by her mother, perhaps through the constant motherly advice of Mrs. Benton, perhaps from a new-interest which 1 seemed-to-have sprung up in her heart for-the tem- poralities of the new parish of St. Monica, in which she -saw, her young friend so interested; whichever it might be, something had brought out the before^ undeveloped resources of her character, in a way to astonish her friends. The long winter, the dread'   Ingtlewood.       19 1I99 heretofore of Marion and Alice, came laden with joys congenial to the mind. The families made a point of meeting when evening " drew her crimson curtains round" for social enjoyment. Mrs. Benton proposed historical research, and as Father Sheri- dan had a good library, and Mr. Benton's books were choice, they had great success in that direc- tion, the gentlemen reading aloud, while the ladies plied the busy shaft of industry. It is an interesting study to note in such a group as our friends formed, gathered around the cheer- ful hearth, the different impressions received from the same volumes. Mr. Benton with his strong powerful will, deep thought and experience of life; Dr.- Nelson with his calm, quiet aspirations after right and truth; Horatio Leighton with his yearn- ing for position and advancement, and his honest avowal of the same. Mrs. Benton with her loving heart, and clear head; Marion with her father's powerful will unsubdued, and with the unconquered stirrings of her ambitious nature, astute mind and desire to be always first; Alice Leighton, with humble, quiet ways of seeking information from all; and dear, motherly Mrs. Leighton, with her large blue sock which she was always knitting, and her kindly interest in all. It was a pleasant group, now and then enlivened by the happy face of good Father Sheridan; who by his solid good sense would often give the castles in the air built by the young people a very sensible shaking in a kindly way. It was proposed by Dr. Nelson, at one of these gatherings, that each should bring, on a, cer- tain evening, without consultation with each other,   200-       zeawthorndean. the male and female character in modern history which most interested them individually. Each was to give in his or her ballot with the names fairly written. Mr. Benton's selection was St. Francis de Sales and Helena, mother of Constantine; Mrs. Benton's was St. Francis- Xavier and St. Monica. Marion selected Napoleon Buonaparte and Joan d'Arc; Dr. Nelson, St, Francis de Sales and Katharine of Arragon; Mrs. Leighton brought Sir Thomas More and -Madame Guion; Horatio Leighton, Charlemagne and Mary Queen of Scots, while Alice Leighton selected Washington and Soeur Rosalie, the tale of whose wonderful life Dr. Nel- son had just given her to read. Marion laughed at this choice, and in her heart really thought it very silly; she was quite confounded when Father Sheridan, who came in during the balloting, said Alice had made his choice among the female char- acters, and Mrs. Benton among the males. Out of these differing tastes came discussions, which added many items to the general stock of informa- tion. Mrs. Benton acknowledged to herself that during the whole of their married life she had never before so enioyed the society- and com- panionship of her husband. His old proud ways were seldom noticeable, he seemed like a new creature, and restored to the society of men, he found his sweetest joys in his dear and intimate union of soul, with the partner of his joys and sorrows. His health was still feeble, the manly robustness of form, and quick haughty step for which he had been distinguished, were changed   Ingle Cod.       201 for a premature stoop and a slow measured tread. But Mrs. Benton would not allow herself to look forward to the probabilities,-but dwelt in the happy present with her husband, planning for their chil- dren's good. Through the flame of love ever burning in the breast of the mother, a correspondence was estab- lished between Harold and his father, at first formal and stiff, but gradually it had become a medium for the affectionate counsels of the father, and the respectful affection of the son. ^     * t e\   CHAPTER XVI. FIIRTATIONS HGH AND LOW. Y the removal to Inglewood, Sobriety Top jg ^ had not fared so well as the others of the family. She found more companionsof her own stamp; who were not improving either to her morals or manners. A cousin of hers, stimulated by hearing of her good fortune in fall- ing into a 'big ' rich' family, had emigrated to the region of Athlacca, and their meetings and writings, for Sobriety had acquired a certain use of the pen, gave Mrs. Benton concern for the girl which she had not felt in the isolation of the Prairie Farm. In going through the house she had chanced upon a crumpled half sheet of paper, which she was about committing to the flames, when the chiro- graphy attracted her attention. Her first thought was of a lesson Sobriety had attempted to copy, as Kevery line began With a capital letter; but after some-pains she deciphered the following, which we give literally, with the exception of the form of the letters, which would require types never yet in use. "Deer dan i reckun i dont car A pic for wat riles u bout me Not settin down to grub with 202   FlirttAtions.     203 Mis, bentun- i dont wanter Cos i lik tu be round and se Mis maren thro her pooty i's Upter the doctur, which she duz I tel yur wen her pap ant lukin Now i tel yer if tha jine wont Rashe latun mak a fus the Docturs so pourful gud he hant No lif rashe latuns rite smart And mis maren aint no fule She noes beter than to tak a Fellar wat haint a pic- Rashe was cut up i tel yer Wen she went to rid with the Doctur she sade to se the old farm. Ill mete u nex mundy Ni du fallin yer own tru luv  S t" Somehow this illy written- and worse spelled epistle gave Mrs. Benton trouble in two ways. She feared Sobriety herself was going to the bad, and it brought to her mind thoughts that had come to her on several occasions, and which she had endeavored to repress as vain, foolish and un- necessarily suspicious. For the .first time she regretted the intimacy of Dr. Nelson with the family wholly on his own account. She knew Marion's love of power, and she feared she might be some- what unscrupulous in her ways of winning it. She had tried to quell these thoughts in the past, now she would confide them to her husband. "This would indeed be a perplexing state of affairs, Lucy," was his reply to her first hint on the   :204     Hawthorndean. subject. "The thought is an entirely new one to me; I have seen young Leighton's fancy, but can hardly think Dr. Nelson implicated; I am a poor gossip, but will have ana eye to these matters. Don't trouble yourself, my dear," he added, seeing a look of anxiety on her face. "I -am only afraid," she replied very gently, "that Marion's love of power may lead her to indiscretion." "If I see any thing like trifling," he said gravely, and in his old decided manner, "I shall interfere at once. Has Marion said any thing to lead you to suppos, er own feelings were interested?" "Never by word; and I have not ventured on the subject lest I might suggest thoughts to her mind which as yet are strangers, but she is not confiding like dear Rosa." "No, Lucy, she, has to learn through pride subdued and ambition quelled, as her father has, what a friend she may find in you. I pray God she may not have to suffer as I have done." Once placed in a post of observation, there were few persons more penetrating in their gaze into the motives of action than Philip Benton, and but few days sufficed to show him that Dr. Nelson was attracted towards Marion; but he was weeks in coming to the conclusion that his, daughter was deliberately and determinately giving both the young men sufficient encouragement to keep alive the flame kindling in their hearts. It distressed him, it shocked him, sometimes it angered him, but he waited, hoping he was mistaken, forbearing to tell his fears to his wife, knowing how deeply   Flirtations.      205 she would, with her delicacy, take such conduct to heart. He saw Marion time and again devote herself exclusively to Dr. Nelson when Leighton was present, seemingly absorbed in his society, scarcely noticing the other; replying to Mr. Leigh- ton's observations in the shortest monosyllables, and taking leave of him with a cool bow; reversing her line of conduct at the next meeting, perhaps treating the Doctor with marked neglect, chatting and laughing with young Leighton, permitting various little amenities which the other did not dare to offer, till Dr. Nelson would hastily retire to his office without staying for his chat with Mr. Benton, and wishing in his heart that he had never seen the bewitching girl who had already fascinated him -to a degree he would hardly acknowledge to himself. The father satisfied himself as to his daughter's designs, mortifying as the conclusion was; he did not hear, to add to his mortification, the sly jokes of Sobriety which Marion permitted, nor the foolish things said in the neighborhood, which she allowed Sobriety to repeat to her. By the proposition of her father, she had been reviewing her knowledge of Latin with Dr. Nelson at stated times, when his calls were not urgent; latterly there had been great negligence here; a call from Horatio Leighton would entirely Interrupt the lesson, or she would induce Dr. Nelson to talk on irrevelant subjects till the time was passed, leaving hinm with a sense of short-coming in what he had undertaken. Mr. Benton had seen all this and made his resolution, nerving himself to the task 18   206      I Hawtkorndean. of reproving his daughter with difficulty, his failing health leading him to dread any excitement. The fitting opportunity came sooner than he expected; young Leighton had come in the Inidst of a Latin lesson for her company for a ride, horses saddled and at the door. "Ah!" she said, shutting her book, "how can I resist such a treat, Dr. Nelson, this beautiful spring morning? you must excuse- me." He gently pleaded her father's wishes that they i should be punctual in their lessons, but she, promis- ing for another time, was off in a moment. Mr. Benton heard the voices in discussion, and his first impulse when he saw his daughter mount- ing for her ride was to recall her to her duties; but on second thoughts he saw that, now in her womanhood, other motives than simple obedience to his commands must be brought to bear upon l er.  She returned from a long exhilarating ride, glowing with health and spirits. -The Leightons came over for the evening, but Dr. Nelson did not appear till a late hour, when Marion met him with her sweetest smile, assuring him they had missed him so much, and planting herself by his side, apologized prettily for the morning delinquency, devoting herself so entirely to him to the neglect of the other guests as to be almost rude. She was recalled to herself by her father's voice (whose every tone she knew) inquiring if she did not hear Mr. Leighton asking her to sing. She went with evident reluctance to comply with this request, calling Dr. Nelson to turn the music for   Flirtations.      207 her, returned to her chatting with the Doctor as soon as she could with propriety, and was appar- ently absorbed in the conversation the remainder of the evening, scarcely noticing young Leighton as he rose to go, with the delightful memories of the morning ride embittered by the experience of the evening. Mr. Benton detained Marion when she came for the "good-night kiss," he looked at her steadily for a moment till her eyelids drooped under his pene- trating gaze, and taking the candle from her hand he said, "My daughter, I have a word to say to you." She took her seat with an instinctive dread of a reprimand for her morning negligence, she did not realize that her father's gaze saw further than this neglect of duty. "Marion," he said, after they had sat in silence some moments, and with a voice in which sternness and love were striving for the mastery, though he laid his hand affectionately -on her arm, "your natural love ofpower, my child, is leading you to trifle with the holiest affection one creature can bestow upon another." The tell-tale blush suffused Marion's cheek, but she did not look up. He con- tinued, "I hoped for a long time that I was mis- taken, and that your behavior was the result of ignorance, but I can think so no longer. . I trusted your conscience would check you by a sense of the sinfulness of your course, or proper womanly feelings would have restrained you from such un- maidenly, I had almost said unchaste conduct." "O papa!" she exclaimed, weeping, "you are so severe!"   208      Hawthorndean. "Truth often seems severe," he replied, "but could a truly pure, correct woman, coquet as you are doing?" "But what am I to do?" she inquired, summoning resolution to excuse herself. "You are to return to your duties," he replied sternly. "Do you realize," he added more mildly, "that you are doing that which will eventually break up our pleasant circle, and make enemies "Where all were before friends, by your fitful conduct towards both Dr. Nelson and Mr. Leighton?" "But, papa," she said almost in a whisper, "I have no reason to suppose either of these gentle- men desires to be any thing more than a friend: I thought no lady had a right to think so, till the gentleman had spoken." "That is a miserable subterfuge, my child; as if there were no way of speaking except with the lips. No man in his senses will offer his hand and heart to a woman, unless she has given him reason to believe she looks upon him with favor; and(there are exceptions, but they only prove the rule), ,la refused lover, as a general thing, ought to cause a woman shame and sorrow that she has, through ignorance 'or indiscretion, led to the confession of a love that -cannot be reciprocated.'  "But suppose, dear papa," said Marion, "one only wishes to regard all as friends?"This was said with a pretty downcast look, quite charming; but for what he had himself seen, ker father would have felt that she was uttering the true sentiments of her heart. He looked at her a moment as if doubtful what to say; at length, trying to repress the   Flira-tions.      209 inclination to mistrust her truthfulness, he said, "If one has no choice in heart, one should avoid giv- ing decided preference to either, as I have seen you do many times, my daughter, a marked preference; that is coquetry, systematic, deliberate coquetry, and gives rise, O my child, to the most hellish feelings in the breast of man that can be cherished. Yes, this has made men liars--murderers-adul- terers!"His tone was slow, solemn and earnest, as he uttered these words; and Marion trembled at the depth of their meaning. "I will try to do right, papa," she said softly. "God help you," he replied, kissing her affection- ately; "I expect you to do right, and if you have doubts as to matters of propriety, I can recommend your mother as a safe confidant." There was a shade of reproach as he said this, that went direct to the fountains of her heart, already somewhat 'moved. "Dear papa," she exclaimed; throwing her arms about his neck, "I have nothing to confide." "Marion," he said, removing her arms and hold- ing both her hands in his while he gazed into her face, which she in-vain endeavored to hide, "you have not yet learned to be true with yourself." From that day Marion was continually conscious of her father's watchful eye, her pride had received a powerful check, and she was more circumspect in his presence; but there were many nameless tiny delicate ways, in which her love of power and desire of admiration were displayed, which were not un- observed by another eye, equally vigilant and more jealous than Mr. Benton's. , 18 *   .   2Io     . Hawthorndean. Alice Leighton saw with penetrating scrutiny how evenly her friend held the balance of her ad- miration between her brother and the Doctor. Shie knew- nothing of the ways of the world, but her own guileless heart told her there was a wrong in Marion's course, and gradually the warm friendship which she had given' her was transferred in all its confidence to Mrs. Benton. She, with her gentle, firm nature, took the young invalid readily to her heart, and became the repository of all her, hopes and fears. She understood her nature better than her more common-place mother, and in the end helped her in her efforts after that which was of, more value to her than even 'health. Marion was still the 'reigning queen in Athlacca society, not only by superiority of education and accomplishment, but by her native energy and will. Envious ones called her a "pushing girl," and though exceedingly popular, she failed thoroughly to please,her parents. Dr. Nelson, busied though he was by an ever increasing practice, saw that the image of Marion Benton came between him -and every other earthly object. He began to look at other things through the medium of his growing love for her, and it gave brightness to his many solitary hours, when he could bring himself to hope that ultimately she might share them. He was not much given to building air-castles, his chastened and subdued nature had taught him better; but Marion had attracted and fascinated him, and it must be a hard wrench that could liberate a constant nature like his from such a thraldom. His knowledge of the A.   Flirtations.      2" character of woman and her motives of action was exceedingly limited, and he often blamed himself for Marion's capricious ways, fancying, when she looked coldly on him, that he had in his ignorance- neglected some point of propriety, and offended her delicate perceptions. "The great lack in Dr. Nelson's character was a just appreciation of him- self; with that, he would have advanced more rapidly in the world, and been more successful in love. ^ *    G:'    .   CHAPTER: XVII. RAMBLES ABOUT HAWTHORNDEAN. - t 'b 1 HE estate of her grandfather, to which Rosine Benton had gone from the sea-side, V &OU  was situated among the range of hills that traverse the eastern part of Connecticut, within which certain townships afford a soil rich and fertile as the river bottoms, the land culti- vated to the very hill-tops. The air of this region is bracing and invigorating as mountain breezes. Exquisite pictures constantly meet the eye of the traveller, gems of quiet, placid beauty, looking out where least expected. The sweep of the hills, gracefully undulating, affords a .,peculiar charm to the landscape, unknown among mountains, or in a -more level country,  - The fat of three hundred 2acres in this fertile region had made Mr. Hawth-orne, not a rich man, as we count riches in the city; but who is really richer than the owner of an iunencumbered farm like his, free from debt, with the gatherings of his years of health laid by for old age? His farming united the independence of the farmer with the:' taste and refinement of the gentleman. It is needless to say, that Rosine was here free and 2 I 2   Rambles about Hawt/horndean.   213 happy as a mountain stream, living over again the days of her childhood with her dear brother Willie. Her health became reestablished and her spirits buoyant, after she heard of the pleasant change in her parents' home. Dr. Hartland came according to promise, as soon as he could leave town, with fishing lines and rods, fictitious flies, and make-believe worms, for a trout- ing excursion. "You don't want me, of course," said Rosine, as she saw him preparing for the day's pleasure; " so Willie and I'll go a nutting." "Want-you!" he exclaimed, stopping her as she -was running from the room, "of course I do- who's to show me over the hills and far awa'?" "The girl you left behind you," she said, archly. "But, Ned," she added seriously, "you will have no sport with Willie and me chatting about you; trout, I have heard, are very shy.' "Never mind; it is late for trout, and as some famous angler has said, 'The gentleman angler who goeth to the river for his pleasure, he may come home lightly laden at his: leisure.' You see I don't expect much in the way of piscatorial luck, so you must go. I shall not leave you at home." And thus it came to pass, that with the old family gray, the safest and gentlest of the -horses for such an excursion, they took their departure for one of the clear pebbly brooks that run among the hills, with banks fringed with a heavy growth of alders mingled with, willows and graceful elms. The Doctor-suggested several stopping places, as they crossed the w nding stream, but Rosine would   214      - awthornden. not listen to any propositions of the kind, assuring hiihm that she knew the very best spot, and- that he should not stop short of that. ",There, you must: let down these bars," she said, as they came to another crossing, where the brook suddenly turned from an opposing hill and shot across the road through an open field; " we must ride through this 'lot,' as the people call it, over to that alder copse and the wood you see beyond." The Doctor obeyed very submissively, guiding the tractable beast over a gorgeous array of whor- tleberry bushes and sumacs, clothed in the first brilliant livery of autumn. "Now We must leave the wagon," she said, as they- came upon a huge Virginia fence; "we can ride no further, and we must carry our luggage to the sweetest spot." "Your most obedient," -cried Dr. Hartland, springing from the vehicle, and lifting her and Willie to the ground, he made a low obeisance, 'saying, "Any further orders, madam?" ' "Yes," she replied; "we shall want your help with this heavy basket, and you must come -back for your fishing tackle, unless you will trust Willie." "Do you mean to camp out to-night?" he in- quired, in a mock-serious tone, as he lifted the hamper; "we are victualled for a long time, judg- ing by the weight of this basket. I shall not be able to sing with Walton, 'While I fish I fast.' I wonder if he never took lunch in his knapsack?" They-found the pretty nook Rosine had desig- nated as their stopping place, after crossing the fence and brushing through a group of swamp   I --Rambles about Hawlhorndean.         2 5 maples gleaming with bright colors. Heavy hem- locks bordered the stream on either side; and far away down the valley the banks grew steeper, and the evergreens climbed-one above another till their tall tops seemed "close against the sky," and their broad branches met and mingled across the rivulet, shutting out the sunlight. In a bend of the runnel there was a space cleared on the south and west, and closed in on the -north and east. An ample grape-vine, now bending with its rich purple clus- ters, swung its fruitful branches over the limbs of two tall weeping elms, which seemed to stand sentinels in the open space. Under the shadow of this vine our friends rested with their burdens. From this one sunny spot, amid so much shade, might be seen to the south, range after range of green hills, resting themselves as it were against each other, sloping gradually to the verdant-valley of the Quinneboag, dotted on their sides and very tops with pretty villages and neat farms, now in the shadow, now in the sun, as the glancing clouds flecked the autumn sky. Near by the clematis hung its white feathers all over the hazel bushes, while the brilliant golden-rod and asters of various shades of rich purple mingled their'colors with the hues of the kindling leaf, and the squirrels sported and chattered among the falling nuts. The eastern view from this enchanting spot looked far down among the dense growth of hemlock, like gazing  into a grotto, through whose leafy walls a  glimmering stream glided with only a low mur- mur said "'Sunny Nook,' Willie and I call this," said   2 I 6     Hawthorndea. Rosine, as she saw the unfeigned look of delight upon the Doctor'sIface, "and the village people call that Paradise," she added, pointing down into the leafy. cavern-like obscurity.    . "A funny notion they must have of Paradise," said her companion, throwing himself at full length on the bed of leaves that had drifted into this sheltered spot; "quite inappropriate! I shall call it Purgatory." "' Your idea of Purgatory, then," she said, laughing, "is a good place for catching trout." '"Rosine!" he exclaimed, trying to look grave and raising himself on one arm to look at her, "what is the matter with you? You are getting as keen as a brier. O, Iv recollect; you. have reached seventeen--taking the liberties of age, ha?" "No, Ned," she replied seriously, "I don't know why it is, but I always feel gayer and happier here than in any other place; Willie and I have such nice times. Don't we, darling?" she said, closing the little boy in her arms. "No restraints of form and ceremony," replied the Doctor; " yes, there is something delightful in that; we were born for the country, I know; it was a great mistake putting us into the city. But you remember, last evening you had something to tell me-something particular." "Aren't you in a hurry for your fishing?" she inquired as she drew a letter from her pocket, and -letting her little brother slide from her lap and run for the flowers, whose bright coloring he had suffi- cient vision to discern. in the sunshine. '; Time enough," cried the Doctor; " never be in a Ti' eeno'ugh     O      in a.

"You may play off there, Willie dear," she ,said to the child, giving him fruit from the basket; "'don't go where it is dark or where you hear the water. Precious child!" she added as he leaped and scampered away into the sunshine with his, constant little terrier, his unwearied companion, "do you think, Ned, there is any hope for his sight?"  Dr. Hartland looked after the boy. and shook his head. "I may as well tell you, I think not; it the disease is what I fear, there is no hope." Rosine looked down in thought, and neither spoke for some moments. ' I'm waiting for the news," he said at length, "cheer up an"k give it to me." Rosine raised her eyes and with a half sigh said, "You can't guess where Laura isi?" "No," he replied, as a frown dark as the shadows of the trees came over his hitherto sunny brow; "no, don't bring that woman into this pure blessed I -   sunshine, I don't want to know where she is." "Very well;" she said, again folding the letter and rising to go to Willie. "No, stay," he cried, seizing her hand, "ifyou knew what is and has been said about Laura Marten, you would hardly speak her name. That rascal Le Compte boasted at a dinner not long ago, that but for her inopportune, illness they should have eloped, and wears a ring which he swears is her ,gift.

"Your friend Laura is with me, her father brought her here, by her own request, to remain whenever she chooses during his :absence. She appears much grieved for her a st folly, and desirous of making all the reparation in' her power. Her health is still delicate, and she shuns all society. She mourns the day she enticed yotu to be a partner to her secret engagement with Lieutenant Hartland. I look to you, dear Rosa, to dro something toward making her peace with Colonel -Hartland and his family," -"'Who'is it?" interrupted the Doctor, starting to his feet, as-if he would not listen to another word. "Sister Agnes," replied Rosine, very quietly. "'I was about to curse her up and down," he said,/somewhat savagely, "for hinting at peace with the family, and friendship with you. The Orphan's Homie is a gid' place for the girl. I hope good Agnes will keep her safely, but if you value the ho-nor of our family, you'll have no hand in making pea ce: for iher.

A cry from Willie at this moment reached} their- ears, he had fallen down an embankment to,the very brink of the water, not much hurt, but thoroughly frightened. Rosine reproached  herself for leaving him, brought him back into the sunshine, soothed and petted him, and, as soon as the April shower was dry, rambled off with him among, the scattered nuts, unheeding the Doctor's repeated calls to her to- return. The fishing prospered when he found his com- panion was determined; she only returned a few moments for lunch, and was away again; leaving the Doctor under-the dense shade, weaving the links of the past with bright visions of the future, till her ringing voice was heard, assuring him that she was homeward bound, for the sun was almost down. Rosine's vacation was too soon over, though it included many bright and joyous days, in a few of which Dr. Hartland's company added to her enjoy- ment, but Laura's name was not again spoken, and it was a long while after her return to the city before any mention was made of her in the family. Rosine wondered within herself if she ought to call even upon Sister Agnes while Laura was with her, since she -knew Ned's indignation at' themen- tion of her name, and saw plainly that neither the Colonel nor his lady cared to know where she   220      RHawihorndean. m  ,-h;ia   d a yearning of the heart for he. -old',e:(idt-y et Shfe k'ew' she ouglt- to make no' advances for a renewal of the friendship, and when she considered 'her position, there was a slight feeling of vexation that Sister Agnes should expect' any thing of her in the way of peace- making, after the oft-repeated warnings she had received against' the companionship.

THE. first breach of the silence with respect to Miss Marten took place one evening just after the family had comfortably arranged themselves, each intent upon their own business; the Doctor, with pipe and last Medical Journal, seated near Rosine, who would occasionally apply to him for the solution of some difficult problem; the Colonel with his daily paper, and Mrs. Hartland with the last number of Harper, and her knitting, without which she would have felt that she was idle, when a servant came in with a note for Colonel Hartland, containing a request from  Sister Agnes, that he would call at the House of the Infant Jesus as soon as convenient "I wonder what's the matter there!" he ex- claimed, reading the note aloud. "Don't go, sir,' replied his son. "Laura Mar- ten is there, and, you may depend this is somez. of her management; don't go." "A   very gentlemanly response to the -gopd; Sister's polite request!" he said, turning upon his. son. "What on earth could Laura Marten want 221   222      ]hawth/orndean. of, me;? Id^i't believe;in this: senseless talk of an engagemnent between -herand Aleck, though Rosa hdre:.tries to convirnce ne." Rosine, who had sat with both hands pressed against her ears pouring over a proposition she was to learn by heart, looked around at the sound of her- name, which came to her dimly. "What is it,?" she inquired, the conversation having been lost on her. "Here it is," replied the Colonel, giving her the note. - O, do go, " she said, rising and coming towards 'him as she took in the contents of the note. "You will go?" He drew her down upon h1b knee and replied, "Yes, my blessed little daughter. Did you ever know me to refuse the request of a lady? I leave that for Ned." 'I really wish you would go, husband," said Mrs. Hartland, energetically, and with a sharp glance :at -Rosine; "I wish this matter settled, and LaUra iMarten made -to understand that we do not, and:will not acknowledge the engagement." I f you- would delegate me, sir, in your stead," spoke the- Doctor, -rising in his excitement, "I'd sooan'nail 'Laura Marten's pretefsions to the mast. The unprincipled, impertinent-' -?-Stop, -Ned,"' said the father, bringing his hand forcibly ,down upon the table; "Laura ought to have .an- opportunity to Speak- for herself; I'll$go at bnce: itf may prevent you, my boy,: from saying: hmany -things you may wish unsaid." M rsI Hairtland, taking this opportunity to. call on -H .ln taig hs p'   r Revelatiolss, .     223 a 'friend with' whom she would remain till - the Colonel returned, Rosine was left alone with the Doctor. She was gaining in decision of character and force; the timidity of her childhood was beginning to wear off, though she could not yet' control her color. ' Ned," she said, as she took her seat again for her lessons, "you are very revengeful .-toward Laura." "You don't know any thing about it," he replied; "she has done wickedly." "We all -come under that condemnation," she replied, timidly.  "Don't say that, child," he retorted. '"I hate cant. Don't put yourself on a level with Laura Marten." "She has had no mother," continued Rosine, turning about towards him, and speaking earnestly, "no brother to tell her what was wrong. - I have had both," she added, with tears in her eyes.' "If she has erred more than I, it is because I have , been kept by friends and home influences from the' temptations she has met; besides, 'if thy brother. offend against thee seven times, and, seven times turn again, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him,' and Sister Agnes says she is so penitent." This was unanswerable. Dr. Hartland  wanted to say "stuff," but he had too much respect for Rosine's religious principles, so he puffed away without a  -reply, -while- she-- turned- again- to -her books,i and was- soon- absorbed in her studies. . "Rosita, Sister Rosita,"'-he commenced, after -a- half hour's silence, " come, leaver those dull books;   ;22A4     Hawthorndean. I wish to speak to you. Wouldn't it be more profit- able to be looking after Dota Greenwood than seeking Laura Marten?" "O, dear Miss Dora!" she exclaimed, without turning from her books, "I long to see her; but how can I? She has never called here." "'And probably never will," he interrupted, with a shrqg of his shoulders. "The Colonel might put you in the way of seeing her, if it wasn't for the Commodore." "Are not they friends?" exclaimed Rosine. "I always thought the Colonel was friendly with every one." "It is. an old story," replied. the Doctor, " and is not worth the ashes," he added, knocking the ashes from his meerschaum. "The old story! Ill blood between: the army and the navy. Mrs. Army looks down on Mrs. Navy, and Mrs. Navy snaps her fingers in the face of Mrs. Army. Besides, he ,suspects the Commodore of --preventing Aleck's promotion, and the Commodore hates the Colonel for telling him plainly he was a fool to force Harry i nto the naval service against his inclination; so they go. I'm glad I am not'in the mess." Colonel Hartland found Sister Agnes alone in the little parlor of the Orphan's'. Home. "I have sent for you," she said, after the first kindly salu- tation, "to see Miss Marten; she has something of importance: to communicate. You and I both knp9w that her conduct has been very indiscreet-, nay, I must speak the truth, very wicked;; but .iffit. ts anyg satisfaction to you, I can truly say she gives evidence of her deep, earnest penitence for her    Redvelations.               22V folly, she is entirely willing to leave the matter with you; she would have-seen you before this, but that her delicate health required that she should be kept free from excitement." - The Colonel bowed, thanked sister Agnes for her communication, and followed her to another, room. She left him at the door, where he rapped and entered as Laura rising from her seat, neither putting out her hand nor advancing, till he stepped forward and greeted her with his usual courtesy. Traces of weeping were on her cheeks, and there were lines of sorrow in her young face'; her short hair clung in tight curls to her head, giving her an exceedingly youthful look, but the brilliant bloom of former days was wanting. Laura had planned how  she should meet this interview, and what she should say, for many weary sleepless nights, but the words choked her, or fled from  her memory when she attempted to utter them. "I don't deserve any thing," she said at length, in a low husky voice, her eyes cast down and her hands clasped-" any thing from you or your family, but contempt." She had begun where she intended'to end her speech. "But," she con- tinued; "I will endure any punishment, even sepa- ration from all of you, but I must tell you-"She paused and trembled, and her face became deadly pale; the Colonel sprang forward. "No, I shall not faint," she said, recovering herself and stepping back, she gave into his hand a paper she held, the same she had shown sister Agnes in her sickl room; it was worn and, blistered with tears. - -Shte turned away from the Colonel as he opened it, and hidl'-er   ,26      Ha-wthvodean.  face in the folds of the curtain. The Colonel pu i up his eye-glass and read: ,'This certifies that Lieut. Alexander Hartland and Laur Marten were united by me in the bonds of marriage in - Church, P--- April 20, 18-, according to the laws of th State oft-- ABIEL STEPHENS, Rector. MARY A. STEPHENS Witesses HELEN STEPHENS, ) The Colonel dropped his eye-glass and lookc fixedly at Laura. "Married!" he exclaimed.. and Aleck married!" He glanced again at/tl paper, took Pa memorandum book from his pock and copied it. ",Laura, does your father know of this?" he sa at length.  "Yes, sir, I told him this morning.- "Where are his lodgings? I will see him once.  , He found the stout old Captain wholly unpt pared to compromise or hush up matters, but bole -declared his intention to publish the marriage the morning papers. The Colonel wished to investigate, to be st there was no mistake, to hear from Aleck beft the thing was. made public. "Laura had behax very improperly, and- there could be no harm waiting: awhile longer;" but the Captain sw( roundly that "Laura had done no more than fo respectable -married women he could name; : promised well-for the future, and indeed he belies in letting bygones be bygones; as'to-mista   there was the marriage certificate, which could be easily proved valid, if that was what the Colonel wanted." They parted much excited, Colonel Hart- land hurrying home, forgetting'his wife; but she, wearied with waiting, had taken a carriage- and reached home before him, Unlike his usual light hearted cheerful comings, he went to his own private parlor instead of joining the family circle, or even looking in upon them. "Father's in trouble! waterlogged!" said the Doctor, shaking his -head as he heard the door close after him; " something goes against the grain. You never find father going into such close quar- ters without a denouement.  As a youngster, I always trembled when the Colonel took to his\ private room, for I expected something serious after it. I was sure he had heard of my-youthful delinquencies, and was prepared to give me what I deserved." As he spoke, a servant entered with a summons from the Colonel to his son. Rosine smiled, and the Doctor putting on a distressed- look, went out of the room humming, "O. would I were a boy again." "It is worse than I thought, Edward," ,die never called him Edward except upon very serious occa-- sions,) 'it is worse than I thought," said" the Colonel before the Doctor could fairly close the door after him, "they are married!" Dr. Hartland's face became intensely pale for a moment, and he stopped short in his advance,-as if he had been struck. "Where-when-by Wvlom?   228      Hfwtfworndean. - demand proof!" he said as soon as he could speak. "She has the marriage certificate--here is a  copy-examine it." Dr. Hartland took the slip of paper into his hands. "Last April," he soliloquized, "while she was with her aunt. Well, sir," he said giving back the paper, "all I can say (if this be genuine,) is that Aleck deserves dishonor for such a contempti- ble piece- of trickery. But even if it be true, it must not be made public till he returns." "We can't help ourselves," said the Colonel, tilhe Captain vows he will have the marriage in the morning papers; the question now seems to be, shall we make Laura one of the family, as will be expected by the world." "Excuse me, sir!" exclaimed the Doctor, impa- tiently, " but who cares for the world, or what the world expects?" "Everybody of sense, Ned; nobody more than yourself, only your world is narrower than that of most people. Yes, the opinion of the honorable, right-minded portion of the world is worth regard- ing. If Laura is Aleck's lawful wedded wife, she is my daughter and your sister, and as such, has a claim upon us for protection. If the matter had only been done honorably, all this tomfoolery with Le Compte would have been omitted, as I should have put a stop to the proceedings. The question now is, what are we to do, as things are? If Aleck is recalled forthese Mexican troubles, he may be home sooner;than if the Department left him where he is; that is--," his voice trembled, "if the poor   Revelations.      229 boy comes out of4it alive. By the way, Ned, I heard down town to-day that Harry Greenwood had thrown up his commission rather than fight the Mexicans." "Good-!" replied the Doctor, "I expected it when I heard his ship was ordered home to pre- pare for the Gulf of Mexico. What will the old Commodore do now?" "They say he is almost frantic, fretting and fum- ing, and swears he will disown him, forbids Dora to speak his name." "Infatuated girl!" said the Doctor, with a half sigh; "a life of constant slavery, when she might have had love and freedom." "'Yes," replied the Colonel; "how strange;- so different from our anticipations. Here is Dora, whom we once longed to take to our hearts, would not come; while Laura, whom we regret to accept, is ours without asking." "'Don't mention Dora Greenwood and Laura Marten in the same breath," exclaimed his son sharply; " if it is your fixed resolve to receive this woman-as one of your family, it is perhaps not my place to remonstrate, but I will only beg, for Rosine's sake, that you will consider the influence of so equivocal a character on her young mind." "Look here, Ned, one would think Laura was your own wife, by the way you bristle up when she is mentioned. I only wish to do right," he added, "and your mother must be consulted." It was with reluctance that Colonel Hartland revealed  the discovered secret to his wife; he dreaded her just indignation with the deceitful 20   230      Hlawthorndean. course of the young couple, -as well as the real misery it would cause her to be so thwarted in her one earnest wish to keep her sons' affections all for herself. The Doctor had often troubled her, once seriously, in these matters, but Aleck had never caused her a moment's uneasiness; she was as sure of him as she was of the Colonel. Her husband, with all his knowledge of her, was hardly prepared  for the blank look of distress, and the gush of tears with which she who prided herself on her perfect self-control met this intelligence; but with the pru- dence of a woman of the world,she restrained her tongue, and only requested the Doctor to desist from the vituperation which he heaped upon Laura. "The world," she said, "always pronounces the woman entirely to blame in a clandestine marriage, and family quarrels, Ned, are decidedly vulgar; so as the matter is, and we can't help it, it will be best. to be quite formally polite to Miss -- to Laura, and I will call upon her in due time with you, my son." "Excuse me, mother," replied her son, with the customary shrug of his shoulders. "I have no formal politeness to waste upon Laura. I should certainly make a balk of it, if I called. I beg your pardon, but you must find some other companion." Rosine was perhaps more shocked by the news of the marriage than any of the family. She re- ceived it the morning after the Colonel's interview with Laura; she was surprised by two hands thrust before her face, holding a newspaper wet from the press, one finger marking the paragraph: "In ---, April 20, by Rev. A. Stephens, Lieutenant Alexan-   Revelations.       231 der Hartland, U. S. N., to Miss Laura, daughter of Captain John Marten, U. S. N." A flash of indignation covered her face and neck, but not a word was spoken by herself or Dr. Hart- land, as he folded the paper and went; out. All her feelings of pity for Laura were scattered to the four winds, and she began to feel ashamed of her plead- ing with Ned to spare her; the desire to see the friend of last winter, which had been growing upon her since her return to the city, vanished like a breath. She remembered Father Roberts' counsel with regard to the intimacy, and a sense of shame at the near association that had been between them came upon her; her pride was wounded, and she forgot in a moment all the arguments for brotherly charity which she had urged only the previous evening. She was inclined to resent Mrs. Hartland's re- quest that she would accompany her in her first call on Laura, but that lady spoke in a tone from which Rosine had not courage to appeal, and the call was accomplished in Mrs. Hartland's stiffest silk and stateliest manner, while Rosine looked as if her last friend had forsaken her. There was no place amid so much formality, for even a look sacred to early friendship, and Laura's heart, which had trusted much to Rosine's warm, loving nature, died within her, as she said her- cold farewell. s                .9 " ' '   CHAPTER XIX.          l REMNISCENCES. DURING the Christmas holidays, when Rosine had nearly, given up hope that she might renew her acquaintance with Miss Greenwood, there came a note, won- dering if Rosine had entirely forgotten her, accom- panied with a pretty souvenir in the shape of a benitier, beautifully carved in jParian marble, repre- senting an angel holding the font, on one side of which a grape-vine trailed its fruits and leaves; while on the other, beards of wheat were carved in delicate tracery. The note urged in warm tones Rosine's promise that she would make an effort to come to the Commodore's house for the sake of her friend. Dr. Hartland pressed upon his father the pro- priety of making the first call with Rosine, which was forthwith accomplished, and matters were put on such a friendly footing, that the omnibus which passed the Navy Yard stopped quite often, to drop or take up our young friend, on her visits to Miss Greenwood. The Colonel, who was somewhat old-fashioned in his notions, questioned once or twice the pro- priety of so young a miss taking so long a drive 232       .   Reminiscences.      233 alone in an omnibus; but the Doctor reminded him that times and customs had changed since he was young, and women were considered quite compe- tent to traverse the round globe without- other protection than their own innocence, and it was well for Rosa to take her first lesson of " the rough and tumble" in a route of six miles or so, in an omnibus by broad daylight. -These meetings were a source of much pleasure, as well as profit, to Rosine. She found herself always welcomed, pressed to stay, urged to come again, but her visits were never returned. She saw no one in her calls but her friend, the grandfather having been taken to his rest, and the Commodore never appearing. Miss Dora's parlor, to which she soon found her way without a servant, overlooked on one side the Navy Yard with its groups of tasteful buildings, the parade ground, and the busy life of the ship- builders. The sunny side of the room hung as it were over the ocean; and the neighboring city, with the constantly passing and repassing white-sailed ships and majestic steam vessels, was in full view. The interior was suggestive of comfort, but not of luxury; though taste and refinement were visible everywhere, they were displayed at small expense. A deep alcove, well stored with books, occupied the side of the room between two doors leading to other apartments, which Rosine had never en- tered. The windows were filled with choice exotics, and the sunlight streamed in during the whole of the winter's day. This, with the well filled and well ignited grate, gave the apartment a cosy, homelike look, which won Rosine's admiration always. An 20*   234      Hawihorndean. unexpected holiday occurring in midwinter, she remembered her promise to her friend for a whole day, and eager for the pleasure, she forgot to con- sult the time, till she was safely deposited by the faithful 'bus at the gate of the Navy Yard. A sight of the large church clock not far off, made her pause and ask herself if it would be an intrusion to have come so early, but it was too late for that' consideration, and she made her way, as usuall to the pleasant parlor. Rosine entered after her light tap, but found no one within; though the door to one of the inner rooms was ajar, and she was startled by the sound of sobs and bitter weeping coming from within; at a loss what to do, her instinctive delicacy led her to take a position at the farthest window and gaze intently across the waters. The sounds continued many minutes, mingled with faint ejaculations, as if of prayer; presently all was quiet, and after a moment, Dora came forth, evidently not expecting to meet any one, the tears still on her cheek. A faint flush overspread her features as her young J friend came forward to greet her, and as she clasped her in her arms, Rosine could feel the' quick throbbing of her heart. ' My sweet child," she said, "I am glad of your happy face to-day. I have been at my prayers; it is the golden hour, as the Italians call it, but I see I have lengthened it," she added, looking at her watch. Rosine:apologized for her early appearance, with a glance toward the half-open door through which Miss Greenwood had come. "Ah,?my sweet confidant, I will show you what   Reminiscences.      235: is very sacred to me," said Dora, and taking her hand, she led the way towards the oratory. The tiny room was oval in form, lighted by a dome of diamond panes colored with dark rich shades; in the very apex of the dome was a -dove- with spread wings pictured in the glass. The floor was inlaid with wood of different colors and shape, forming figures and anagrams; at the end of the room opposite the door was a large marble crucifix,. on a broad pedestal of the same material. - Against the wall above the cross,. hung a Madonna and child, a very ancient painting; evidently by the hand of a master. The stations of the cross were represented around the-deep blue walls in fourteen cameo-like pictures. Rosine knelt with her friend as she entered this place made sacred by prayers and tears; no word was spoken as they paused before each representation. When they returned to the parlor a heavy sigh escaped the young girl's lips. "I have made you sigh," said her friend, kissing her, and drawing her towards a couch opposite the windows looking down the bay. "It is but right I should tell you why you find me so sad. To-day is my lost bro- ther's birthday, and I cannot forget him, especially there," she added, pointing to the oratory. "I mean to talk with you of him, if it will not pain you." "O, thank you," said Rosine, slipping her hand- into her friend's; "I should love to. hear more of him; the Doctor, once spoke of him in the most affectionate terms, but I never dared to ask any more than he chose to tell." "Ah, yes," replied Dora, "Edward Hartland.   236      Hawthorndean. could speak of' him from the heart as I can, for he loved himn well." She paused a moment to recover herself from the agitation some memory had pro- duced. "You have found me, Rosa," she resumed, ' when the old grief is aggravated by a new; this must be my apology for my want of self-control. My brother Harry's ship is in the offing; we expect him soon, perhaps to-day. You have heard of his resignation; my father is incensed against him, and against me also, because I cannot think he has done otherwise than nobly, to renounce all worldly advancement for the right. You do not know what it is to have known duty clash with parental com- mands; God, in mercy, spare you that trial. Harry returns, true, noble-hearted boy, to a home where he is unwelcome, and to companions who will throw cowardice in his teeth, because he will have nothing to do with this unjustifiable movement towards Mexico. If his resignation is accepted, he stands at the age of twenty-three without a profession and almost without means, except what firm health-and a stout heart give him. But he will only grieve to have brought. upon himself the continual frown of his father; upbraiding will be dreadful to one of his affectionate home-loving nature. I don't know why it is," she continued, turning her'face to Rosine, "but somehow, though you are many years younger than I, it is good to speak to you of what I mention to no one else; and I can even talk to you of Ear- nest and my early days. Since our first meeting at the beach, before I knew who you were, I had this same wonderful heart-drawing towards you, like an elder sister's confiding lobe."   Remuziscences.      237 Rosine pressed the hand she held in hers, she could not speak, but she looked with her tearful eyes into the face of her friend, with a look that told at once how fully she reciprocated her warm affection. "Dear Rosita, I wish you to know that I did not always live as I do now. My childhood's home, for which I sometimes have such a longing as I cannot describe, was in a lovely country town, among the birds and bees, and I was gay and happy as they. My father's pay as Lieutenant was small, and his long absences left my mother to manage the affairs of the family as she chose. Colonel Hartland's- sons were at school in the town where we lived for some years, and boarded with us; I may say we grew up together. It was then and there the friendship, the like of which I have never seen, was formed between my brother Earnest and Edward Hartland. 'They were per- fectly inseparable, and shared each other's every feeling. In their case is the only proof I have ever seen, that the love that we are told existed between David and Jonathan is still possible. At the age of sixteen my father insisted, as he had many times before threatened, that Earnest should join the navy; but my brother was determined on college-life with Edward- Hartland; they both abhorred the service in either army or navy. He was a resolute, daring boy; I wonder at his daring, as he stood before his father, perfectly respectful, but determined ; no threats of punishment could induce him to swerve from his purpose, and my father turned him adrift into the world; but his friend and   238      HaaWtkorndean. he clung together, and shared every thing. Colonel Hartland was very generous to his son, and, by great economy and self-denial they ma le what was meant for one provide for two. I have known them both go out and teach school for three months, "to assist Earnest in getting on in his classes. "About this time my poor mother was taken from us, and I was left, at the age of' eighteen, with the care of Harry and the house, my father being no more at home than formerly; you will, guess that all I could spare went to aid Earnest in his studies. Matters went on in this way, till Harry was placed at the naval school sorely against his will; he was as resolute as Earnest, but he had an instinctive, I think I may say a religious, dread of braving a parent's displeasure. It was my father's secret hope that before Earnest could complete his college course he would be obliged to come to him for help; here he was disappointed. Angry with the whole Hartland family, he had a special aversion to Edward. He returned from the Pacific seas after an absence of more than two years; it ' was the autumn of the graduation of Dr. Hartland and my brother. He found the affairs of the family in such a state-." Miss Greenwood here faltered in her recital, grew extremely pale, and Rosine per- ceived her trembling. "Ah, that was a dreadful time," she said at length; " the memory of it is like a withering blast; it was as if the hot breath of a furnace should pass over these japonicas and roses, pointing to the window, "and change them in a single moment of time to dry and withered sticks. Our beautiful country home- was broken up, my   Reminiscences.      239 brother was ordered to choose between his own kindred and his friend; he made his choice, and was forever separate from his family. I had the same choice to make, Rosa," she said, tightly clasp- ing the hand she held, "and my conscience would not let me give up my father, and-yes, the good God has shown me I was right, for through grief and sorrow I learned the way of the Cross, which I had never been taught; but I am wearying you with these memories," she added, as Rosine laid her head upon her shoulder and hid her face. "Go on, please," she replied in a voice almost inaudible from emotion, "you must let me weep with you." "Thank you, darling," continued Dora, "I am afraid I am selfish, but it is a sweet solace to speak to you of these things, and the knowledge of themn will lead you to know Dr. Hartland better; but the saddest, saddest tale is yet to tell. The young men finished their professions with high honors. Earnest did not appear to mourn continually for his friends, as I did, but when we met, (as we did occasionally by stealth,) he could speak but little, only pressing me to his heart, and begging me to do as he had done, pleading for others as well as him- self. Colonel Hartland proposed to the young men a voyage to Europe, to recruit his son's health, which was impaired, and a sojourn in Paris for a while as a help to their profession. My father would neither take leave of Earnest, nor suffer me to have one parting word, and O! it was -the last time; we had never been wholly separate till I felt the awful sea between us. I cannot tell you of that voyage,"   240      ,Htawthorndean. shte continued, checking the sobs that would have entirely overcome one of less resolute nature, "the papers were full of it at the time-the brave, the good, the great, the abandoned, and the dissolute, went down into one common grave, and three only of the hundreds that crowded that ill-fated steamer, remained to tell what they had seen. Edward Hartland was one of the three, and from him no one has been able to learni the most minute par- ticular. It was long before he reached home, and longer yet before he took his place again among men. My grief at that time, Rosa, was that my poor longing eyes would never look again upon my beloved' brother; but now there is a deeper grief, I mourn for his soul--so uncared for, unwashed, uncleansed. Can it be, that God will forever banish from His presence one so untaught in truth? O, my child, it is for this I weep and pray, if perchance there may be hope even now.' Rosine's heart was aching sorely for her friend, but she was at a loss what consolation to offer; she dropped on her knees by her side and laying lier head gently on her lap she whispered, "Our dear Lord is merciful, and Father Roberts says one act of perfect-contrition, one earnest desire for the sacra- ment of baptism, where it cannot be had, may save the soul in the hour ,of death." "That is my only hope, dear," replied Dora, looking up; then pausing awhile, she added, as she felt the hot tears of her friend drop slowly on her hland, "I have talked to you too much in this strain, you will pass but a sad day with me." "I like to hear of him," said Rosine, wiping her         Reminiscences.      24I eyes, "I knew there- must be something very sor- rowful about this friendship of Ned and your bro- ther, for when I asked the Doctor why he had never told me of his friend, he answered in his gruff way, 'because I must not be sympathized with,' and his step and manner when he' said it, showed he was suffering most keenly." "Good, noble Ned," replied Dora, "I dare say he longs for your sympathy, but less unselfish than I am, he would dread making you unhappy. Try to comfort him if you can, Rosa, for his young life was sadly blighted. But I wish you to know Harry," she added, changing the subject for fear of returning emotion, and opening the locket she had shown her friend in a former interview. "He is not like Earnest, but a brave, fine fellow, with a-con- science like the purest crystal. I expect him here before long, you may be sure he will be in haste, for never was there a heart that beat more fondly for his own home and friends. Hark! that sounds like -a salute," she continued as the noise of a heavy cannon reverberated across the water; " he will come here at once, and he must not find me in tears," she said, going to the mirror to arrange thet dark braids of her hair. Rosine gave a little brush to her own locks, as she sat looking far out into the sea, wondering if she should really know 'that gentleman,' and. if he would recognize her. In all Zer visits -to her friend she had not once met the Commodore, and her dread of meeting him was much increased by the recital of'the morning, but to-day she was doomed to encounter his dreaded presence. Before the echo of the guns announcing O1   24      Hawthorndezan. the anchorage of the man-of-war had died away, he entered. She had imagined a bold, piratical looking gentleman, and her astonishment was great when she saw a short- square built figure in an undress, his nether garments tucked into his long, boots, and his close cap pressed down over his heavy brow. His thick mass of gray hair, together with an immense grizzly beard, and moustache, gave his face a somewhat savage look. A broad, self-assured chin, and long Roman nose, told of a powerful will; in his eyes alone, which were very dark and lustrous, Rosine saw a resemblance to his daughter., She was gazing down the bay with the telescope when he entered. "Well, Dora," he said, coming towards her and clapping her, on the shoulder, "do you see him? That's his ship just anchored-wants heavy repairs. I hope we may bring the boy to reason yet before she's ready for service. But who have you here?" he added as she laid down the glass and brought Rosine forward to introduce hier. - At the first sight of the young girl' the Commodore's face lighted up, and he prepared as bland a smile as could be painted on so rough a visage, but at the name "Miss Benton," there was a change, the frown returned, and he drew back, bowing- very slightly, freezing Rosine in an mstant. He turned away from her at once, and continued his conversation with his daughter. "I have business in town imme- diately, and shan't be here when he comes up to the house; but you'll see him, and if you wont back up your old father in this matter, just hold your tongue and say nothing." ,    Reminiscences.      243 With this he went to the door, Dora following; in the hall there were more words, a loud voice, oaths, and angry tones. It was some moments before Miss Greenwood came back, and when she entered, it was from the oratory, her face-very pale, and her lips quivering. She did not renew the subject of her brother's return, but brought autt cabinets filled with the treasures of land and sea, precious things with strange devices from-foreign lands, which she explained to her young friend, entering into the subject with deep interest, and never pausing till she thought her companion's mind was turned from the unfortunate interview with her father. Rosine little suspected that she had been the cause of all the loud talking in the hall; the Commodore having  guessed she was Philip Benton's daughter, cursed every branch of the family, as belonging to the man who had de- frauded him of his hard earnings; he swore his- children were ungrateful brutes, they chose their friends from those who had wronged him every way; taunted Dora, with her early predilection for his enemies, vowed he would marry again and cut off his children with a young family. The quiet dignity of his child as she met this tirade, awed the old man in the midst of his wrath, little did he know or care for her after struggles in the oratory, with a heart that rebelled against a life filled with these grating elements. The ladies had just finished their lunch, which was ordered in the sunny parlor, when the sister's quick ear caught the sound of a footfall on the pavement, and a springing step on the stairs, and x    244      Hawthorndean. in au few moments she was clasped in her brother's arms. "Thank God! I amn with you," he exclaimed; "and a free man," he cried, embracing her a second time. "Harry, my own dear brother, God be praised," she replied, bringing him forward to Rosine, and introducing her as "'her dear young friend."' "Excuse me, sister," he said, after the first formal greeting; "I have met this young lady before; her face is not readily forgotten." Rosine blushed crimson as he held out his hand again; saying, "Let's shake hands for old acquaintance sake; I could not but remember the fair-the flower table. By the way, Dora," he continued, observing the -i Confusion into which his remark had thrown- Rosine, '"what's this I hear of Aleck Hartland? Clandes- tinely married to Captain Marten's daughter! Cap- tain Jones told me as I came up. Is it true?" "There is no doubt of it, I believe," replied Dora, "and it has caused a great deal of very unnecessary talk." "People will talk when men do such astonish- ingly silly things. What on earth had they to pre- vent the marriage being made public? I -am sorry for Aleck. His ship has been ordered direct to the Gulf of Mexico, and will not come home first, as we have done." Dora changed the subject to the fair and the flower table, and the three laughed merrily over the odd volume of Jane Eyre. Rosine related how carefully Ned had secured the other, and Lieuten- ant Greenwood declared with true gallantry that   Reminiscences.   -   245 he "should never part with the mate." Alone for a few moments with his sister, he made further inquiries of Aleck Hartland's marriage. "She seems to be quite alone," said Dora, "witlh , no protector, her father being ordered away again. There is, as you have heard, a great deal of scandal about her; but she has lately of her own free-will gone to stay with Sister Agnes, which looks well, certainly. Colonel Hartland's family have quite cut her; it seems a pity, such a young, motherless girl." "I will call upon her there with you, for Aleck's sake," replied her brother. "I am certainly bound to believe nothing bad of his wife till he believes it; however, all my memory of Laura Marten is of an abominable flirt. Why, she had the air of a coquette when I was only a middy! I rather won- der at Aleck, and yet no, I don't; such quiet unsus- picious men are sometimes the first to get taken in; and I have heard that Laura was very fascinating." The sun, that had shone so brightly when Rosine left home, had become gradually obscured, and snow began to fall quite fast before she was ready to return. Lieutenant Greenwood insisted upon seeing her to the Colonel's door, although she repeatedly assured him she could find her way per- fectly, it was not nearly dark, and she was so accus- tomed to the route. "But this short winter's day will come to a close, Miss Benton, before you reach home, and it will be quite dark; the coaches too run very full at this hour, uncomfortably so for a lone lady; besides, at least while I wear these," he laughingly added, pointing to his shoulder-straps, "I could not suffer you to run any risk of being 21*   240o      tlawthorndean. benighted, without danger to niy reputation as a soldier." Rdsine was truly thankful when she entered the crowded 'bus, that she had a protector, for men and boys had taken most of the seats, leaving a woman with a babe in her arms standing, and an old man leaning on his crutch. Harry Greenwood soon shamed two stout fellows into vacating their seats, for these, but all his logic was unsuccessful in securing a place for Rosine; so she stood by his side, his arms supporting her in the rough jolting, till they were safely landed at Colonel Hartland's house. The. Colonel rubbed his hands with delight when the young couple appeared, and laughed heartily, as he said, "To think how Ned would snarl, he having just started in his chaise for Rosine. I told him," said the Colonel, "to wait patiently, for with such a body of loyal soldiers as you have at the Navy Yard, one could be found as an escort for a lady, but I own I didn't expect to see you as knight-errant, my fine fellow. What about the commission?  Don't you know, Harry, if you give up that, you lose a great chance with the ladies? They say these-are a great attraction;" he added, laying a hand on each of the young'man's shoul- ders. The Lieutenant returned the joke by saying, "If shoulder-straps were the magnet, they were wel- come   to his any day, but for himself-why that was another question-he must own he was as yet free." The Dogtor came hurrying  home   about five minutes after the Lieutenant had taken leave. "So , I    Reminiscences.-     247: you gave me the slip -completely," he cried to Rosine, as he brushed the snow from his coat over the Turkey carpet, and shook his wet hat over the polished grate; "you have given me a long, cold, disagreeable ride for nothing, and run away with ' that gentleman' into the bargain. I shall charge you for this." "Don't be so very cruel, Ned," she said, coming towards him and taking his outer garments. "It vexes me to find him gone, too," he added. "I saw his Captain to-day. He says the Navy can't afford to lose such as he, and begged me to use my influence to recall his resignation-ball!-if I influ- ence him, it will be on the other tack. The Com- modore can't hate me much worse than he does already."              ' "Did you see Dora?" inquired Rosine, without a thought what she was saying. Dr. Hartland looked at her intently and then replied, "Only for a moment--we were exceedingly gracious to each other; she regretted 1 should have had so much trouble-and so forth--but, Rosa, you were singing something very sweet when I came in, what was it? Try it again for me." "A little German song Dora gave me," she replied, going to the piano. "I think it is nice, only somehow I like to sing it best when I am alone." "Imagine me a cabbage then," he-said, " and let's have it." "The long, long weary day, Is passed in tears away, And still at evening I am wleping.- When from -my window-pane.   21        NacWihordean. I gaze on night agair, I still am weeping, My lone watch keeping. "When I, his truth to prove, Would trifle with my love, 'For me thou shalt be weeping; When at some future day, I shall be far away, -Thou shalt be weeping Thy lone watch keeping.", "Dont sing that sentimental 'English nonsense," cried the Doctor, interrupting her; "give us the original, it will awaken memories of 'fader land,' for I heard it first in Germany." "I can't trust myself to sing German yet," she replied;' ,i will learn, on purpose to sing this to you, but I must finish it in English:" she sung, "But, ah, my -love is dead, To Heaven his life has fled  He was with heart and soul mine only I ne'er shall see him more, My grief will nee'r be o'er; I must weep only, Be ever lonely." It was sung to a plaintive air, and when she had finished she found the Doctor resting his head gainst the mantel and looking forlornly into the "Did Dora ever speak of me to you?" he said turning abruptly to Rosine as she came and stood She was confused for'a moment by the sudden-   Reminiscences.    ; 249 ness of the query, but said with some hesitancy, "Yes, Ned, she has spoken of you to-day, and told me such a sweet, sad story about- her dear lost brother; it is his birth-day, and I found her, weep- ing, and wept with her." ," Well, you may, weep with her, and with nme too, -he replied bitterly, "for never a friend lost a dearer. Why, Rosa, upon my return to life after that terrible voyage, when I knew that he was sleeping down among the coral reefs, I begged them day and night to cast me where he was; he was dearer to me than all heaven and earth: and poor Dora weeps and prays, I'll be bound, for his precious soul!" he added with a. half sneer. "Yes," said Rosine, timidly, "but-is not that better than not to care for one's soul or the soul of one's friend?" "Did you mean that for me?" he replied, look- ing up into her face. "If you did, you may ease your mind on that point; I believe, but it is in a God of infinite love, yearning for our return, ready always to help us, not watching for our halting, as some good pious ones misrepresent Hinj.  I do not believe in a God who could condemn such a soul as Earnest Greenwood to eternal damnation, simply because he was not baptized, or had not 'experienced religion,' as you good people tell of. He did nothing but experience religion all his life, if love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, meek- ness, temperance, go for any thing, and they are called the graces of the Spirit. He had them all; and he had trials in his bitter cup which few men knew, and yet he never .let go his trust-his trust -in   -250     HEawthiorndean. God or man, and you and Dora condemn this noble soul-'" "Never, Ned, never," she -replied earnestly, "else why should Dora pray for him? No; the Catholic Church holds that one strong earnest desire for baptism where it cannot be had, one perfect act of contrition for sin, one perfect act of love for God, saves the soul for whom Christ has died, in the hour of death-is, in fact, the gift of faith; and we don't know how often this may come to poor souls in their dying hour; at any rate, we do know and believe; that God is infinite in His mercy, and will not cast out any who came to Him; but we do feel that it is dangerous to defer our duties to that hour." "Ah, Rosine," he said, "there was a time when I nearly lost all confidence in every thing human or divine, but it is coming back to me," he added gently, "and you have helped me wonderfully." "O how I wish I could help you, comfort you," she added in a whisper. "Tell me how." "Be always true, Rosita," he replied; "always transparent, free from cant and trickery, and non- sense, as you now are, and keep your faith bright, 'you can do wonders." /   CHAPTER XX. HARD TO FORGIVE. ljrISS GREENWOOD and her brother, on their way to accomplish a-call upon Mrs. Laura Hartland, suddenly came upon Rosine, who was persuaded after some little urging, to join them. Neither Dora nor the Lieutenant had more than a passing acquaintance with- Laura, and they would not have sought an interview with her, except from the benevolence of their hearts, and as the wife -of their friend. Sister Agnes, to whom they were no strangers, had hinted that it would be a kindness, and she received them now with her always cordial welcome, while to Rosine she extended a little reproachful pat, re- minding her how she bad neglected her mother's friend. Laura met the visitors with a smile, but Rosine, who knew her so well, saw the shadow that came after it, the care-worn, anxious look, which had once been a stranger to her countenance. The bloom was returning to her cheek, and the flash- ing of her- eye reminded Rosine of the past, but the subdued and thoughtful expression that had gathered on her face, gave her more of beauty but 2 XI   152   -   Hawthorindean. less of light than formerly. In parting, Laura drew Rosine: to her bosom and imprinted a kiss upon her forehead; wliispering,-". Don't' hate me." Sister Agnes begged of her a visit of a whole day during the following week, that she might show her the children of the House in whom she used to be so much interested, and Rosine, though she dreaded the visit, could not well refuse. The sight of Laura had disturbed her; she felt that Dr. Hartland's influence over her here had not been good, but more than all, she realized the positive hatred that -had been growing in her heart, as the kiss still burned upon her brow; the kiss that had roused in her only feelings of repugnance. She had once reproached Ned with injustice and hardness, now she-had a vision of her own unholy, unforgiving spirit. She listened to the faint ticking of the clock (Laura's present), as:she communed with her heart in her own chamber, upon this change in 'her inner feelings; there was a change even in this memento of love, the figures were not visible, the tapers were lying unlighted beside it. She almost hoped something might happen to prevent lher visit, but instead, there came a letter from her imother, inquiring if it was inability that kept lher so entirely from her mother's friend. The day came, bright and clear, and there was no excuse, so she took her way to the House of the Infant Jesus, with only feelings of distaste. She found Laura gone-for a walk, by the urgent advice of the Sister Superior; she had seldom   ventured out alone, though she had been an inmate of the Home more than' two months, There -was no reproach to   H1ttard to 'Forgive.    253 Rosine in Sister Agnes' warm greeting and kindly manner, as she took her young friends over the large establishment, showing her the new nursery, where fifty infants of less than two years were tenderly cared for. "You don't know what a help I find in Mrs. artland," she said; "all -these quilts are of her knitting," she added, pointing to the pure white - coverings of the tiny beds; "she is bound to finish them all alike, and so neat and pretty;'then there is no end to the little garments she invents; she is never a moment idle, for an idle moment brings only anguish to the poor girl's heart. Tell me, Rosa dear, do they ever speak of her at Colonel Hartland's?"                 "'Very seldom," replied Rosine with some hesi- tancy, and thinking she saw a slight-shade of 'reproach on the Sister's face, she added, "I don't think any thing I -could 'sag would make it any better." "Perhaps not," sighed the Sister, "though I did hope the Colonel, when he knew her real penitence, "would allow her -to take a position in his family, for' her own and husband's sake; for us, we should' miss her sadly here." "Is she cheerful?" inquired Rosine. "Sometimes," replied the Sister; "yes, even gay when she is frolicking with the 'children,'but every daya\ brings its sad hours. Perhaps the .Colonel thinks a longer season-of probation necessary, but it seems to me as if every day would make a recon- ciliation more difficult. O, my dear. child, how hard we frail mortals are upon our fellows, when 22   :s54      Hawtzorndeazn. perhaps the great God, in 'His infinite 'purity, sees on;, our character. blots as deep as theirs!" Rosine struggled' with^ contending feelings. "!Sister:,Agnes," she said at length, "the Colonel 'is. waiting to hear from Aleck before he takes any step; but for myself, I must tell you I have had dreadfully bitter thoughts toward Laura, they seem like: love turned almost to hate; her past conduct appears to'me so unworthy of a pure woman, since -I knew 'she was really married all the while. I have disliked to come in contact with her, I may as well, confess it, there is something within repels Ime from her, when I used to love her so dearly."  'Ah, Rosa," said the Sister, taking her hand caressingly, "we should be in a sad state if our dear Lord cherished such feelings toward us- and yet I suppose they are natural feelings; but our Gospel has taught us better things, and we may .abhor the sin without hating the sinner. Laura's sins are such as the world winks at in those who have friends, wealth and position, but in her comparatively friendless condition, they grow into crimes even in the eyes of those who are ,indulging the same folly and love of admiration. Do not think," she added, noticing an expression of surprise on the young girl's face, "that I would 'have you look lightly or without abhorrence upon Laura s course; -unfaithfulness tg the marriage vow evenn ithought, has God's special curse upon it,; I want -you only to hate the sin and pity the sinner; especially when humbled as Mrs. Hartland is*. perhaps by a gentle softening word here and there, you may open the Colonel's heart to his   )aard to Forgive.     1-55 son's wire; she has a perfect yearning for recon- ciliation, and with her affectionate generous nature, kindness can do great- things. Mind, Rosine, I do not mean to recommend a violent intimacy between you and Laura, a strong girl friendship;; but now she is in trouble you mayhelp her, and by your better. training and knowledge of right, win her to goodness by interceding for hler in the family?' Before Rosine could reply, the street: door opened and closed with a sudden crash. Laura stood alone in the hall, aghast with Iterror; she could not speak as Sister Agnes led her to the visitor's parlor. "What is it; dear?" she inquired, soothingly, as Laura bowed her head on her hands, and' trembled all over with agitation. "It is lhe!" she exclaimed, wildly rocking herself. to and fro; " he will never leave me--he followed me-he is at the door-even -here I am not safe!" The Sister assured her that no one could be admitted there without her permission, but it was a long time before she was at all calmed, or traces of color came back to her cheeks and lips. Rosine's gentle heart began to melt before such evident suffering and sorrow; she came to her, as she was wringing her hands with distress, and whispered, "Laura, I have wronged you, can you forgive me?" "O, Rosa," she replied, "if you knew-what H have suffered, am suffering, and must suffer ::you could 'not hate me; you would at least pity mue'  "We will be .friends again," said Rosine through her tears, her warm, impulsive nature making her forget, every thing,          '   -e5 . iHawhzorndean., ',. Sister Agnes was called away by the imperative duties of her vocation, and the young people were left together. Laura poured out her whole soul to her' youing friend; reproached herself, and no one elisefor all that had befallen her; recited the long story of her illness, the many times she had longed to: die, if only she could assure Aleck of her sorrow for the' past,/and of her unchanging love for him -thlougli all. She convinced Rosine that she had :no earthly'y wiish but to-be at peace-with her hus- ,band:', aiid 'rid "of that terrible Le Compte, whom she :-sometimes thought must be the arch-fiend himsdelf.' Rosine's heart, so cold and bitter toward Laura in the morning, was warm and glowing with love and .pity when she' returned at night. . The trust- i'ng,/ coonfiding, unsuspicious spirit of uncorrupted youth! is it not a treasure we may carry to old ,age With: us, if we would cherish the spirit of our dear Lord, in forgiving to the ",seventy times seven"? Rosine found the family dispersed in various directions; Mrs. Hartland gone to a meet- ing of a charitable society, of which she was presi- dent; ithe Colonel not returned since a call to business in the morning; Dr. Hartland still at his office.'-She threw herself in the large arm-chair near the library fire without even uncloaking, and gave .,her mind up 'to 'reflection, as: to what she could offer Laura. The story of Le Compte and his dreaded- influence made her untutored soul tremble, and she could not prevent a shivering sen- sation: of fear, when she recalled Laura's descrip- tion of his appearance at her Aunt's, and- the fear-   - -ard to Forgive.     257 ful proposition he had made. It was grievous that so young and fresh a mind should be tortured with the knowledge that such things are. Rosine trem- bled and wept alternately, starting at the least sound;. now wishing somebody would come, and anon hoping they would not, till she had recovered her usual calmness. In the midst of her bewilder- ing reverie came the Colonel, the room was indif- ferently lighted with one drop-light, the gas par- tially turned off and he did not see Rosine till he came close upon her. She arose immediately to give him the comfortable chair.  "Where are you going, daughter?" he inquired, "or have you just came in?" "No, father," she replied, "I have been home some time. I was only thinking." Her tone was strangely sad, and the Colonel drew her down upon his knee, and tried to look into her face. "What troubles you, my   dear?" he inquired, anxiously. "Aren't you well?" "Perfectly well,"' she replied, then hesitated. "Out with it, my child," he said, affectionately. "I have been to see poor Laura, and I was thinking of her,", she answered, quite simply. "Pshaw! Rosa, he replied hastily, "don't give her a  thought; she'll take care of herself, she's used to it.", ", please don't say so; she is dreadfully perse- cuted, tormented, and so troubled and sorry every way." She then related, unfortunately perhaps, the fright Laura .had experienced', in the morning, from the near approach of her tormentor.  ," This, is all moonshine, my chilid" he replie 2exB   -2558 -  Hawtholzndeann.- with all, the assurance of cautious age; "she im- poses upon you. I can't let you go where she is, if she entertains you with such stuff as this." "But, father," she said, entreatingly, "I saw her fright; it could not be feigned; and she is so penitent. I do wish-,"/' she hesitated, then paused. "Wish. what, my darling?" he inquired, caress- ingly. -  "I don't like to say it,'.for fear you will be angry with me,; but I do wish you would be her protector." ' "My dear little innocent girl, has'she -deluded you with the 'idea that she wants a protector?" f "O, I do wish Aleck would come home!" she exclaimed, finding she was making no progress in convincing the Colonel. {' I know he would forgive her, if nobody else will." "Indeed, Rosa," he replied, gravely, A'he has the- most to forgive. If Laura had behaved respect-- ably, she would not be as she now is; she must suffer; such conduct brings its own punishmnent, even if she were ever so penitent. I could have received her here into my family, though I abhor her course, but I find her conduct has been more scandalous than I thought; no woman is talked- abouJ; as she has been, without reason." "Yes," replied Rosine; slowly, a little abashed; ".buttthen Laura hates her past conduct,and wants' to do right now, and ought we not to forgive her if:: she is-really truly sorry, and- resolved to do so -no more.'         .  : ::Well, ,my-dear, we may forgive her if we will   Ha;rd to Forie.      259: but-it does not follow that we must give her the same confidence we did before. But you are very  young to know any thing about these matters, it was an unlucky day when Laura Marten chose you. for her intimate friend. One thing at least she is  old enough to know, that when a man's honor has, been wounded in the person of his wife, you touch; him, and through him all his family, in the tenderest point. You must trust me to do right in this mat- ter, little one," he added, stroking her bright curls, and speaking very tenderly, ":and not worry your. over sensitive conscience about one'who is not worthy of your anxiety. I shall be guided entirely by Aleck's reply to several letters written him from home on this subject; till then matters must go on as they are."  Rosine was not at all relieved by this conversa- tion; she feared she had not taken the best way of speaking about Laura, and yet she had the assur- ance that her motives were right in the effort she, had made. She could not reconcile the opinions of good Sister Agnes and her dear Colonel, so she went about her daily- life as usual, sorrowful for her friend, but never speaking her name; hoping each day that something would come from Lieutenant Hartland that would bring about a change in Laura's position. Sister Agnes had impressed upon Laura: the duty of returning, Mrs. Hartland's call, which she did after some delay, but findingithe family out -and a strange servant at the- door,-/she was reluctant to leave her card as "Mrs. Hartland,.' and the family were left in ignorance of the call, Since her last- meeting with Le Compte, she had   26o      tHawthorndean. not. ventured into the street alone; but when accompanied by one of the Sisters, she drew down her thick veil, scarcely daring to look either to the right or to the left. Thus she who had once been remarked for her bold, venturesome, daring spirit and manner, was completely cowed. It is not always that by coquetry and deceit, even a married woman brings such immediate suffering upon her- self as: Laura had done, but it comes in time, and they invariably leave a sting that pierces the heart sooner or later-it may come in the life of a beloved daughter or son, for the sins of the mothers are visited upon their 'children. Le Compte met Dr. Hartland occasionally in the way of their profession, and he would sometimes apiuse himself with hints of, his intimacy with his brother's wife, hoping thereby to widen the family breach, or lead the other to some retort which would bring on a quarrel; but he did not under- stand the:spirit with which he had to deal. High tempered and easily excited, Dr. Hartland looked down now so thoroughly upon both Laura and Le Compte, that -all he said passed by him as beneath his notice. After much anxious waiting, a letter,. only one, came from Lieutenant Hartland, and that written to his father.- ON BOARD THE X---, OFF CADIZ, JAN. 18-. "MY DEAR FATHER: "I am in the receipt of various epistles from home, filled with sundry inquiries and criticisms on my private affairs. I will answer them all through you.   Hatrd to bForgive.     261 "Laura Marten was made my lawful wife on the 20oth'of April last; she has the certificate of our marriage. I am sorry this step does not please you, and my mother; of Ned's caustic severity upon the same, I shall take no notice; written by any other man, I would call him out. With regard to the scandal abroad, if it were -not dishonorable in me to throw up my commission on the eve of war, I would do it, for the satisfaction of chastising those who have made themselves busy with what is none of their business. I have been on the sick list for the last month, or you would have heard frotm me before; I am now just able to crawl about, and bound for the Gulf of Mexico; God knows when, if ever, I shall-see home again. You will do as you please about noticing Laura, but it strikes me all this scandal might have been nipped in the bud, if when the marriage was made public, you had made her like one of the family. I have received a long letter from--my wife; written since her fearful-illness, explaining every thing; and I have also Rosine's last letter, which I keep by me as a comfort in much weakness, and a sedative in those dreadful nervous attacks to which of late I have been subjected. "Believe me, my honored- father, this, step you deem so unpardonable, though 'taken hastily per- haps, under the excitement of the moment, was not done with any intended disrespect to either your- self or my mother. In haste, Your affectionate son, ALEX. HARTLAND."' . ..   :262      f Hawthorndean. d. The manly tone of -this epistle had great effect 1upon the family; it brought home to their hearth- stone the truth, that the pet of the household, the youngest .born, was on his way to the seat of war, perhaps to waste away with disease in an unhealthy climate, perhaps to sacrifice his life on the field of battle. The letter served to quiet the Doctor, and prevent his oft-recurring reference to the" new member of the family." Mrs. Hartland was visibly softened by it, and called upon Laura with the Colonel, leaving behind a-cool ceremonious invitation for Laura to tea the next day. She begged Sister Agnes to say it was not her duty to accept this overture, buts the good Sister could see only a positive duty in acceding 'to this first way that had been opened toward peace and harmony with her husband's relations. When she came, Rosine exerted herself to make the time pass pleasantly, the Colonel and his lady were politely-cool, while Ned spent the evening at his office. There was no nearer approach to intimacy than this chilling civility, during the winter, though Laura, in obedience to a request from her husband, removed her quarters to a fashionable boarding-house. 'Here the terrible dread of Le Compte, which still continued, so af- fected her nervous system, that every card brought to her room gave her a paroxysm of fear; and there wasg also a -sharp misgiving in her mind whenever a letter came to-her from her husband, for although their tone was affectionate and confid- ing,.t hey wholly ignored Le Compte and the past, and with something of the Doctor's peremptory   HaVrd to Forgive.     263 tone, requested that Le- Compte's name might never be -mentioned between them. Lau-ra would have felt more secure, had he sometimes reproached her a little for her unfaithfulness. For some reason her tormentor seemed for awhile to have ceased to follow his victim with persecution, perhaps -the publishment of the marriage may have led him to defer his plans-perhaps to renounce them, perhaps to change them-we shall see.- \  e    , . .  CHAPTER XXI. HARRY GREENWOOD .IN SEARCH OF A PROFESSION. WHEN the Athenian, the man-of-war to which Lieutenant Greenwood belonged, was ordered to the Gulf of Mexico, and the chief officer proposed a ball on" ship- board to inaugurate her departure, the Lieutenant had not heard of the acceptance of his resignation. Commodore Greenwood insisted that both Harry -and Dora should accept their invitations. "It would look well," he said, " for the first Lieutenant and all the Commodore's 'family to refuse Captain Jones' civility." The stern mandate of parental authority prevailed over his children's dislike of the whole thing, under the circumstances. It was to be almost exclusively a naval-and military ball. Col- onel Hartland and family were among the invited, and to him was sent under cover a card to Mrs. Alexander Hartland. This was the signal for a warm discussion as to what should be done; the Colonel declaring he should send a carriage for Aleck's wife-it-would be best for all, if she went under his protection; the Doctor stoutly insisting that he would not appear with her, and so risk Rosine's good name as to have her ushered in withl such a-he was about to say something vcy l J264   ,   Harriy Greelznwood.     265 wicked, but his father's one stern look, - 'which'he kept for great occasions, andJ Rosine's affectionate "Don't, .Ned," silenced him. The card was sent, with the Colonel's expressed wish, that she Would be ready at eight on the night of the ball, when he would call for her. Laura unhesitatingly took the note and card at once to her mentor, Sister Agnes, her only counsellor, one might almost-say her only - -friend. She was quite secure as to her advice, she could not tell her she ought to go. She 'became pale with astonishment when the good Sister said, "You will go, of course." "O," she replied, with almost a scream of terror, "don't tell me that I must!" - "Not if it were your duty, my dear?" she in- quired. "I can conceive of a case in which it might be one's duty to enter into such an arrangement, and this looks very like a painful self-denying duty," she added, as Laura's face suffused with crimson and the tears fell upon 'her burning cheek. "Don't, Sister, please don't tell me it is my duty," she said, pleadingly. "Not if it is the truth?" replied Sister Agnes. "You see by this note the Colonel and his lady wish to introduce you as their daughter; should you refuse? How would your husband wish you to act under the circumstances? These are the questions you must answer fobr yourself. I own it is rather anomalous to hear a religeuse advocate ball-going," she said playfully, "but in this case I can see no excuse you can give for -not complying with Colonel Hartland's request; your conscience would not keep you away, only your own: will,your 23   266      Hawthorndean: own dislike; to meet those with whom your husband has been associated; you must break away from this feen g some time, and why not now?"While she was persuading Laura, Lieutenant Greenwood and sister were announced; they had called in :behalf of a large family of orphans lately brought under their notice. Tile card of invitation was in -!,aura's hand, and the Lieutenant laughingly re- marked that she had the same "bitter-pill" with thetmselves. ,Yes,' said the Sister, playfully, "and I, a nun, am advising her to take the potion pressed upon her by Colonel Hartland."        :, 'Ah," said Dora, "then do go; you will find plenty, of disaffected ones; I will keep you com- pany in hating the whole thing most heartily; we only go because our father wills it." Laura's courage revived, she saw through her reluctance, and resolved to conquer it; the note of acceptance was dispatched without further hesi- tancy., Doctor Hartland at first set his face like- a flint against this ball of brass buttons; he did not care' 'to be one of a half-dozen civilians among a com- pany of autocrats. More particularly did he sneer and scoff at the invitation to Laura.% But he changed -his mind, and engaged a carriage for himself and Rosine, when he found the Colonel determined, and jhis mother making preparations for hfier. o wn and Rosa's costume. He went out and purchased a set of exquisite pearl ornaments for arms, neck, and hair, ordered the most perfect bouquet he could procure, and began to feel quidt   Harry Greenwood.      267 proud, being sure, he said, of the youngest and handsomest lady on-the ship.  The largen man-of-war was made ready 'from stem to -stern with much labor of time and taste, and with great expense, for the grand fete. All Obstructions were cleared from the' main -and quarter-decks, and the ship's sides lined with the flags of all nations, the stars and stripes -every where prominent. Nothing was wanting that wealth could pro- cure to make a gorgeous display.- Lights of brilliant and varied colors, with highly polished reflectors, illuminated the festive scene, and an elegant tapestry of blue and gold, looped up here and there with knots of flowers and green wreaths, formed an awning over the dancing floor. It was indeed a radiant scene, and Rosine almost believed herself transported to fairy land. In the-midst of the first dance Colonel Hartland appeared- with Laura and his wife on either arm. Amber'beads glittered in Laura's short black curls, amber orna- ments graced her neck and arms, and an amber- colored grenadine floated about her like a 'sunset cloud; there were no remains of the bold, bright glance that -had so nearly been her ruin; -her tnanner was subdued, and a downcast expression had imprinted itself upon her face. Miss Green- wood and her brother came forward and greeted her upon her entrance, but Ned, who stood near by with Rosine, bowed coldly, with a countenance stern and rigid, holding Rosine back/'bylhis in- fluence, when she would have rushed- foirward to her friend. She felt a sense of meanness in being"   268      Hafzawlhorndeanl held :back; but too timid to carry out her pur- pose, she was obliged to content herself with giving Laura one of her sweet, friendly smiles. Itwas not long-before Mrs. Lieutenant Hartland, ushered, in as she had been, and looking so beauti- fully sav was besieged by gentlemen friends of her husband, with pressing invitations to join in the dance, .al:l of which she steadfastly declined; she was trembling inwardly lest she should lift her eyes and behold her enemy.   Miss Greenwood watched her from a recess made by some of the ship's appointments, where she was half hidden, and pitying her most profoundly, dispatched her brother to bring her to her side. i 'I thank you most heartily," said Laura, as. she took the Lieutenant's offered arm to go to his sister. , From this retired nook the two ladies could survey the whole dancing-floor, unobserved them- selves, for green wreaths hung in festoons over them, and green branches sheltered them from observation. Miss Greenwood had been drawn to Laura by Sister Agnes, who had said, "Dora, make her your friend; you, will find material wast-. ing there for the want of some one to direct." She well.-knew how to make advances, and with her knowledge of Aleck's boyhood  she soon found. matter for;conversation, but through much suffer- ing to herself, for every memory of the  early days^Qf^::pe brother was mingled with the remem- brance, ofanother, and brought back thoughts that she .had striven. for years to crush; nevertheless, she did her part well, and Laura did not once   Harry Greenwood.      269 guess over what burning coals her companion was stepping, while she entertained her with little anec- dotes of her husband. Lieutenant Greenwood had passed- over, to Rosine, who was watching ther company through the intricate frolic of a Virginia reel, which had been called for in honor of the Captain, who was from Virginia, and moreover, -had expressed his old-fashioned notions about the round-dances, declaring "he had never been able to understand. how these young heads stood so much whirling." "I need not ask if you dance, Miss Benton?'" said young Greenwood, as he observed her un- affected, eager interest in the diversion. "O, yes, I love it dearly," she replied, blushing under his earnest gaze, "but I could not'possibly dance here."          o "And why not?" he inquired, -smiling. "O, there are too many people looking on, and somehow I don't fancy dancing with strangers. But you have not danced?" she said, inquiringly, "No; I seldom dance except as a lay figure to make up a set. My brain must be very obtuse, for I could never see the ins and outs of the figures; and when my friends get me on the floor, they are generally glad to let me slip quietly away again. It seems a strange, sad way," he added, after a pause, "to celebrate the departure of this brave ship's company to -the field of carnage." "It does, indeed," she replied, her face gathering gravity from- the reflection of his; "one would think they would rather go to church in a body, and pray for protection -inbattle."' 23*   270Q      hawthorndean. ,Yes," he said, slowly, "if one has a right to pray for protection in such an unjustifiable, aggres- sive warfare as this with Mexico, provoked by our own government, as some of the best men of our country do not hesitate to say. But do look at Ned in the corner there, he has been gazing. at that statue of Psyche for a half hour; she does not seem, to inspire him with any mild sentiments, Let's go to him." Rosine took his arm, and they moved to where Dr. Hartland stood, with his back to the assembly, and his eyes still riveted on the statue. "Ned," said Greenwood, "I am afraid you 'wan- der through the , festive scene with soul but ill at ease.'" "Pshaw i" replied the Doctor, impatiently, "I'm thinking what a pack of fools they are; cha- meleons fed on air; kicking up their heels over the guns that shall soon bring them a rich harvest of blood. I'm thankful you are like to be out of it, Harry; I respect you for it; but what are you to do for a living; you must have bread and butter, you know?" "I can get on without the butter, Ned, if it is necessary, but I am coming to your office as soon as I get my discharge, for your advice." "Humph! Advice!" said the Doctor, shrugging his shoulders; "that. is what everybody wants,. what everybody gives, what everybody asks, but which nobody follows." "You are in a sad temper to-night, Ned, what is it? The brass buttons? If that's it, you may have your chance even now; the news has just   Hatrry Greelnwood.     -  7 I come, that Surgeon Welsh of Aleck's ship, the X   , is dead. Don't you want - the- appoint- ment?" "No," replied Ned, almost savagely, "but I can recommend one-Le Compte!" "Shame!" replied Greenwood, under-his breath. "Come," he- added, turning toward Rosine, "let us leave this crotchety man to his own pleasant tem." per, and Psyche for company." "No, Rosa," said the Doctor, laying his hand on her arm, "I want you to dance with me when the waltz commences." "O, don't ask me, there are so many people!" "They shan't hurt you!" he replied, drawing her arm within his. "Excuse me, Ned, but I would a great deal rather not," she said entreatingly; "please don't urge me." He dropped her hand abruptly, and turned again toward the statue.  While this conversation was going on, Miss Greenwood and Laura were fast learning to know each other. Impulsive and affectionate, Laura by- a few words had convinced her companion, that whatever there might have been in the past, there was now no infidelity to her husband, in a heart that listened so, eagerly and with- such simple, pleased attention to stories of his youth.- The company increased, but they continued their chat unobserved. In a group directly before them stood Captain Jones and two other officers of the. ship, evidently much absorbed by the subject of their. conversation. A rush among the dancers   272      Zawttorndean. caused them- to step back, and Miss Greenwood and her companion heard the words, "Surgeon Welsh of the X--, is dead." At the naming of Aleck's :ship, Laura involuntarily caught Dora's arm.,- "There-are several names spoken of for the appointment," said another officer, "but I'm told that scamp, Le Compte, has the best chance." Laura- pressed her hand over her mouth to check the impulse to scream, at the sound of the name that brought so much terror to her heart. "If he stood any chance of being shot," replied Captain Jones, "it would b the best thing that' ceould :be done with him.'Lae finished his sen- tence in an aside, in which Laura onlyheard her: husband's name. He then continued aloud, "How- ever, he's a fine surgeon, has powerful friends, and wants the position." Determination and strength of will alone kept Laura from fainting, as she leaned on Dora's arm till ;the first- paroxysm' was over, not answering her attempts' at consolation, bearing her agony in silence; not till she reached her own room did she'give herself leave to think of the probable consequences of the event proposed. Le Compte, surgeon in the same  ship with Aleck,. was the thought that ran backward and forward through her excitable brain like liquid fire; and the missing r-ing, it glittered before her wherever she turned, and the pierciig' eyes of her'enemy glared at her through the tiny- circle. Would Aleck believe 3he was true to hti, should the knowledge of this oss ever comew:?fto- him through Le- Compte?  ,        s9.   Harry Greenwood.      273 Why had she foolishy concealed this loss in the letter to her husband, wherein she told him she had opened her whole heart. O, the false shame that had led her to hide the truth'! it was bringing its own- punishment in fearful torment of mind. The letter from the Secretary of -the Navy, accepting the resignation of Lieutenant- Green" wood, was at length received, and a stormy time they had at the Commodore's. He had from the first hoped something would occur to prevent the acceptance, and now that the matter was finally accomplished, and his son no longer an officer in the navy, and a candidate for naval honors, his taunts and reproaches were most exasperating, and renewed daily; it was with difficulty that the son, a man of honor and bravery, could restrain himself -under the charge of cowardice; but for Rora's imploring look out of her large earnest eyes, and the finger on her lip, he must have answered in such a way-as.,would have broken- the last remaining link between father and son. Day by day he went through the same denuncia-- tions, arraigned and impeached before the tribunal of his father's wrath, but each day brought him renewed strength from above and beyond himself. The hour of meals was-- the usual choice o0 his father as the time when he should open the vials of his vituperation. Once only did Harry so far disrespect his parent as to leave the table in the, midst of the reproaches. Rosine had been brought home by Miss- Greenwood in one of her journeys into the city, and the absence of her father,: as she' supposed for the day, gave them promise of quiet,   :274       awthorndean. but during the dining hour he returned. The presence of Rosine no ,doubt exasperated him, for -he-entered at once into a tirade, in which he vilified-his' son as "a poltroon, that would have been cashiered in the first fight." This, under the circumstances, was more than Harry could bear; he left the house immediately, without a word; it was three days before he came back, and Dora feared lest the harshness had driven him finally from his home; but he returned calm and - placid, with no trace of the passion that had been kindled in his dark eyes. He had sought those helps and consolations which are given so abundantly in times of trial and temptation, and sin, to the Catholic heart in the sacrament of penance; and by a short retreat in the House of the Christian Brothers, dwelling continually in the presence of his dear Lord in the Blessed Sacra- ment, he had prepared his spiritual armor for future warfare. In another week he called, according to promise, at Doctor Hartland's office for advice as to his future course. "Harry, you are a brave fellow!" was the first greeting, as they clasped hands. "I wrung it out of Rosa; she doesn't gossip, but I made her tell me; and really I don't see why you subject yourself to such insults, such abuse. Why not leave, and let your father curse you roundly, once for all?" "No, Ned," replied the young man, gravely, "a parent's curse is, next to the curse of' God, most to be dreaded; but if -in the course of ProvidenceI - must bear even' that, God helping me, it shall snot   Harry Greenwood.       2TS be brought down by a ny thing may do or say to defend myself I think nature would have mas- tered me that day,-if I had not left. Miss Rosine's presence gave a deeper sting to the name of coward, and to the remembranice of the boyish follies brought up against me."  Is it your religion, Harry, that gives you such command of yourself?" said the Doctor, laying his hand on the young man's shoulder. "Ican admire it at a distance, but I know if my father had spoken to me in that way, I should have seared my tongue with words that could never be wiped out. I was snappish to you the night of the dance," he added, giving his hand to his friend, while an emotion of admiration extended over his noble forehead. "Never mind, Ned," replied Greenwood, co- dially squeezing the offered hand; "you and I don't keep old scores against each other, if for no other reason, for Earnest's sake." Dr. Hartland turned quickly away, and stirred hastily the few live coals in the grate. There was a pause of some moments, when with another sudden movement he turned again, passing his cigar-stand to his visitor. Greenwood shook his lhead--another pause. 'Well, tell me about the profession, while I puff, said the Doctor, lighting his cigar.- "Hold on a minute!" he added, as a sudden thought darted into his brain, and rising, he went to a beaufet near by, taking out decanters and glasses. "Help your- self, Harry," he said, pushing them toward his companion; ' the best of old Sherry and Madeira. ," No, I thank- you, Ned," replied Greenwood,   2 76      Hawtorndean. not looking up from the paper which he had seized as soon as he seated himself, and upon which he had already sketched the lines of a cottage with many gables, "What! been in the navy these ten years or thereabouts, and neither smoke, drink, nor indulge otherwise? Why, Harry, you'll do for any thing; but tell me, what's your fancy now by way of a profession?' "I'm looking for my vocation," was the reply, while the drawing progressed rapidly. X Suppose you turn monk. that's thy vocation, Hal," said the Doctor, quizzically. "Indeed, no!" replied the other quickly, raising his eyes from the cottage, his fine face all aglow with smniles. "I intend to take warning by your example, and marry the first opportunity." "And not let fancy, but vocation lead in that matter?" inquired the Doctor, jestingly. F'Fancy may speak, but not guide," replied Greenwood, resuming his drawing. "You are a  choice chap, Harry! I'd welcome you to the faculty; how would you like medicine?" I Thanks, friend," was the reply, while the pencil moved briskly, "but I have not nerve enough, and no taste for it."  "Well, you haven't the dernier resort of the min- istry in your church, and you are too hohnest and haven't talk enough for a  lawyer. Why! you'll make an artist,"- he added, rising and looking over his friend at the sketch, which now exhibited a very pretty fancy, well executed. "No, not an artist,'" he replied, as he pencilled   Harry Greenwood.      2" the delicate lines of a willow to shadow his cottage ; "but perhaps an architect, I think I have a talent for that. I'll tell you," he added throwing down his pencil, "my intellectual taste and talents would prefer architecture on a grand scale. I would like to design cathedrals, churches, religious houses, gentlemen's country residences, public edifices, hospitals, asylums; while my fancy and love of quiet would lead me to seek a country life, and the pursuit of horticulture." "Time enough for the last, when you shall have made a name," replied the Doctor; " then you can take that wife you mean to marry so soon, and with a little farm well tilled, and a little wife well willed, pass the downhill of life in the occupation of your great-grandsire, Adam, but take architec- ture thoroughly first, make the tour of Europe, and get up your name by getting at the soul of old Grecian and Roman architecture. In the mean- time, I am matter of fact, where are your funds? of course, your father wont open his wallet." "I have a small stipend from my mother, which has slowly increased since I came of age. I have never disturbed it, meaning to leave it for a rainy day; that will be'sufficient for immediate necessity, and Dora-" "You'll do," interrupted the Doctor; "only if you ever come to a corner, and want help to turn it, don't go to your father. I'm an old bachelor with an ample income, and your sister will need all her own; so for your own sake, as well as for those we will not, name, never doubt I am glad to share mine with you." 24   278      hTawthorndean. "You are a noble friend, indeed!" exclaimed Greenwood," and I shall--"A rap at the door interrupted the conversation, and after the double knock, entered Captain Jones. "I'm sorry to tell you, Doctor Hartland," said that officer, after helping himself to wine and light- ing a cigar, " that Le Compte has the appointment, through the influence of those high in office, and in spite of our exertions." "Then either he or Aleck, or both, are dead men before the end of this campaign," replied the Doctor, turning pale. "What plot has this double dyed rascal in his head, that leads him to seek this position just now?" "He has trouble at home, I reckon," said Cap- tain- Jones; "there are rumors afloat of disgraceful conduct in the family of one of his patients, and the lady's friends are seeking to hush matters by getting him out of the way." "What villains go unhung!" soliloquized Dr. Hartland. The appointment was confirmed in the papers next day, and it would be difficult to say which was the greater sufferer, the wife or the brother, and each suffered silently and alone. In a few weeks, Harry Greenwood's arrange- ments were made fora voyage to Europe, to pur- sue his studies in architecture, which in the rudi- ments was by no means to him a new acqutire- ment, as almost all his leisure on ship-board had been spent in drawing outlines, ground-plans, pro- jections, elevations, till his portfolio was a text- book, but altogether in the civil branch of the science; not a model, naval or military, appeared on   arry Greenwzzood.      279 its-pages, showing, as Dr. Hartland had long ago said, "his heart was not in the service." His library toot, manifested the same preference for research in this branch of the world's knowledge. To three persons the leave-taking was very sad; to his sister' came memories of another brave heart who had left her mourning and desolate, never to return, but she hid her fears, and gave the parting kiss with great heroism; but many hours went by before she arose from her prostrate position before the crucifix in the oratory, and days of severe struggle with human will, and the strong yearning love of the sister which rebelled against this step, though in the calm interior of her soul, undisturbed by outward storms, she could say, "Thy will be done." Her trials at home were increased, for the Com- modore took the occasion of Harry's departure to reproach her for the loss of both -his boys; but'she did not sit down"and supinely livei over her miseries; she sought those whose sufferings were greater than her own and ministered to their griefs. She succeeded in winning Laura by her gentle, dignified tenderness, to the right way, and assisted- her in her untrained efforts after peace of mind. To Dr. Hartland the parting from Harry Greenwood was a trial, and withal a satisfaction; he did not pause to ask himself why a satisfaction; had he done so, his conscience would have told him it was- not altogether because the young man was thereby advancing himself. He had looked with solicitude on the increasing intimacy at his father's house. "Harry is very nice,'" he said to fahrshue    285 '   .  Hawthourndean. himself; "yes, very nice, but not in a condition to think of Rosine, certainly not yet:" and the last parting convinced him of what before he had only surmised, that the young man was fast getting into deep waters. Innocent, unsuspecting, and unimpressed as yet, Rosine had not restrained her tears when' Harry come to say farewell; she was sorry to have him go, yet quite as much for Dora's sake aso for her own. So as Rosa did not pine after the departed, but went back to her old school-life and the Doctor for help and company at home, Ned was satisfied.   CHAPTER XXII. HORATIO LEIGHTON TAKES A STEP FORWARD. "---]UR western friends have been neglected; we shall forget that, they have been, unless we bring them before us anew. Inglewood had put on the charms of home; the forest was being, cleared, and cultured fields were growing rich with beauty, and culti- vated people were slowly finding out the county- seat. The/growth of the town was like that of many western cities, quite marvellous. Horatio Leighton, in this rising town, was a rising man; he had already been chosen to the State Legislature from the district where he lived, and his name spoken of for the office of State Attorney, and finally he was selected and duly placed in that office. This was the signal for which he had waited.; with this position came bravery.  Pangs, of jealousy had- sometimes made him des- perate, and the long absences from Athlacca which must necessarily follow his advancement, could not be borne till matters were settled with his well- beloved, Still in his inmost soul he knew Marion so well, that he was assured he had nothing to fear from Doctor Nelson. He knew that the unknown 24*            288 I   *U AJZlaWtAtorndea n life of a country doctor could have no attractions for one whose ambition. was continually nerving him on, and who had often extolled his venturesome forth-putting nature, as the ground-work of success. He had reached a great height already for a man of his years, and what would he not aim at, if only he could in the end lay all his honors at her feet! The day after the news had spread of his election to the post of honor, the young man, flushed with success, canme to Inglewood for a drive with Marion, determined to make a venture of his long contem- plated proposition. He was somewhat irritated 'by what seemed to him of late, the constant presence of Doctor Nelson; it vexed him to think his rival was ofthe same faith as Marion, and then he asked after his own faith, and there came back from his soul only an unsatisfying negative. Church decora- tions, altar trimmings, Sunday-schools, were con- stantly bringing the two together, and though he occasionally bore a part, it was only as an outsider; this annoyed him, he would end the matter to-, day. Ah! my, dear young, man it will take more than your solitary will to complete that bargain. He   found Doctor Nelson with Marion, arrang- ng banners and pictures for the Feast of the oacred Heart. She looked up languidly from ier work, as he spoke of a drive, anl expressed l reluctance to go at 'all, but if she went her )reference was for a ride. Forthwith horses were addled and at the door, although it was with diffi- ulty Leighton could hide his disappointment at !e change. Marion was still exacting, wondering iat he co-uld have ordered that ugly pony for her.   A, Step Forward.     283 "But Primus stumbles," persisted Leighton, "and your father has ridden away on Meg," he added, holding the bridle of the pony, and giving her his hand to mount. "What matter if he does stumble," she said; ,' over these -horrid flat roads there is no danger." "But we will go through the timber, and over the bluff if you like, and get -away from these flat roads." Marion pouted and held back. "I would do any thing to please you,'; he said in a whisper; "any thing but put you in danger." As he spoke, Dr. Nelson appeared, leading the censured horse, for at the first intimation of the young girl's wishes he had left the company for this purpose. "Thank you, Dr. Nelson, you are very kind," she said, beaming upon him with one of her sweet- est smiles; "wont you help me to mount?" She kissed her hand to him in parting, and the" two drove down the road, one quite crest-fallen. The physician watched the path with eager interest long after they were out of sight, till recalled by Sobriety, who came flashing by the veranda where he stood. "Thar a good piece away, nigh out of sight I reckon," she remarked He went into the house in some confusion. "Poor Doctor," solilo- quized the girl, " now he's powerful took with Miss Marion, but- there aint no kinder use, she'd wear the life out on him, I reckon." The object of her solicitude did not entirely agree with her, but came suddenly to the conclu- sion that he would confide this matter to his friend, Mr. Benton. It could do no harm, and he was too honorable and too conscientious to take one- step   204      cathzorndean. toward the daughter, without the sanction of the father. It was a grief to Mr. Benton to hear this manly, straightforward, humble confession of love, from the lips -of a man whom he felt was worthy to be the husband of any woman; and when the Doctor regretted that he could offer nothing but an honest heart, and a desire to work at his profession with ,all his might, till he could make Marion a home, the father at once assured him that neither he nor Mrs. Benton would seek wealth or position for the child, and that he had their unqualified respect and esteem, but they could not urge her to accept any man as a husband, without the first requisite-affection. Of that he could not speak with certainty, as matters were, he thought a few quiet days of waiting would, in the end, spare Dr. Nelson's feelings; and with this the young man was obliged to be satisfied.         / The silence with which Marion and Leig ton commenced their ride, so unlike their usual gay chattering, seemed to the young man's heart oli- nous of evil. It was a delightful June morning, the tender verdure of the forest, the soft hazy clouds floating across the serene sky, were suggestive only of peace: but the perfection of inward peace rested not on Marion's brow, she looked and felt exceed- ingly unamiable. The horse on which she rode had, according to Leighton's prophecy, twice trip- ped, but she held the bridle rein very tight, and assured herself there was no danger. "You are offended with me, Miss Marion?" ven- tured young Leighton, wearied  with the short answers and unconcerned tone of his companion. I       )    '    '  "   A Step Eorwar;d.      285 "No," she replied, carelessly; "nothing so serious as that; but you ought to know by this time that I don't- like to berossed in little matters." "Perhaps I am tolish, careful," he said, as if to excuse himself, at e same time reining his horse to keep near her side; "but you know I would not cross you, except there were danger, and you must let me lead your horse down this steep bluff." As he said this, he dismounted and took Primus by the bridle. "Indeed, Mr. Leighton," she exclaimed, "I am quite' competent to drive over this bluff, and must is a word I bear from nobody but my father; it is quite provoking to be treated like a child." She drew herself up haughtily, while he dropped the rein at once and returned to his seat in the saddle. The road grew rough and somewhat precipitous; ,deep indentures marked the whole length of its course, where the careful-drivers of,heavy teams had chained their wheels in descending. From the brow of the hill, far away at the base of the bluff, stretched the rich fruitful miasmatic bottom lands of the river, now covered with the vivid green of the young crops, and the r6ugh cabins of the inhabitants, scattered without regularity ovei this fertile region, poisoned by its excess of vitality, The beautiful Illinois, with its clear limestone bed and its sparkling waters, now subsiding after the spring rains, rolled through these teeming plains, separated from the prairie land and oak openings where our friends resided, by-the steep' bluff which ,our travellers were slowly descending. About half   28-6-     HeawtAorndean.- way down the bluff Marion discovered, among the young green of a maple, a young honeysuckle, wreathing its golden colored flowers around the trunk and among the branches. It attracted her attention; for she wanted the flower a little, but she wanted likewise to restore a more amicable state of feeling; she was somewhat: sorry for her proud speech, it would be difficult to say which motive influenced her the more, but she exclaimed, as if to herself, in a-tone of disappointment, pointing to the branch, "O, how beautiful! I saw one like it last summer, and this is out of reach, as that was." Without a reply, quick as thought Leighton was under the tree, it was still out of reach; but he stood upon his saddle at the imminent risk of his neck, and brought away a long wreath of the sunny flowers with his riding-whip. The cloud was broken up by this act of gallantry, and Marion smiled sweetly, hanging the festoon gracefully overher hat. "Scentless, like all the prairie flowers I have seen, but quite brilliant," she said, forgetting the tight rein while arranging the wreath. Down went Primus, ploughing with his -knees and neck quite a furrow in the descent, throwing Marion entirely over his head.  Her foot was loosened from the stirrup, but her dress caught by the pommel of the saddle, preventing  her escape. -In a moment Leighton was -on the neck of the horse, pressing his weight upon the fallen -animal, while he extri- cated her dress, and with his help she soon limped to a moss-covered log by the roadside. "I am not hurt," she said, in answer to his pleading look and anxious queries, "but essentially frightened.   A Step Forward.      287 Aren't you sorry I did not break my neck?" she added, looking up archly through the tears that had started into her eyes after the first fright; -"but you don't look a bit triumphant," she con- tinued, laying her hand on his arm. Leighton clasped the delicate fingers within his, and bending over her, whispered words that caused her to look away, and suffused with a conscious blush the cheek which a moment before had been blanched with fear. He sat at her feet on the soft turf and urged his suit, telling her with all the vehemence of his nature what he. would do for her sake. It was the first tale of love to which Marion had listened, but even then she was measuring his capabilities.- "He would win a name," he said, "a name that should be honored-in the whole country, and she must help him." Her drooping eyes and softened tone betrayed the fact that- her heart was not untouched, but she held. back from giving the assurance of her love with her lips. '"Horatio," she said, after a pause of terrible length to him, "I do not think you ought to talk of/ marriage, your mother, sister and brothers dependent upon your exertions." "Trust me, dearest," he replied, quickly; "in a few years I will show you what I can do, and my brothers will be old enough very soon to care for themselves." "I think we had better wait," said Marion, quite decidedly; "I hate long engagements." "But I should lose all stimulus for exertion if I could not have your smile and voice to urge me   , - *o ;    -.Iv cnvt foraardf on; I cannot go forward unless I can sometimnes come to you as my own, and rest my weary soul in your love and confidence. I should never try for a name for my mother or sister, they would hardly care whether I gained. position or no; but for you as my ow n I could move/heaven and earth to win distinction." Marion listened with a pleased ear; it was charming to think that the one she really loved in her heart of hearts was ready to strive for that W)ich to her was all, and that he would seek honor, and wealth, and fame, only because of her. She would be his tower of strength before all; and her father had often prophesied that Leighton would be a great statesman; already he was high in office, no long time would elapse before he would be   in Congress, and then! Her first desire was to be somebody, and to her repub- lican tastes, what could be a more enviable posi- tion than the lady of one of the Cabinet at Wash- ington; perhaps-,but we will not tell all the beam- ing visions that darted through her aspiring mind. Her lover plead nobly, and after many arguments and- questions on her part, that would be quite disgusting to a simple, romantic girl, who was so old-fashioned as to think that love, after all, was tee great desideratum in such an affair, Marion was induced to give her consent that her father should be consultd,'and the matter left with him. Many of-the bright hours' of that sunny dasped before either 'of -thef remembered that they would be expected at home.  The horses had tuick y gone to' grazing, and were found with but   A Step Forward.      289 little delay; Leighton insisting on a change of steeds for the return, to- which Marion made no objection. A few words of love, and a more tender care-taking than usual beguiled the way, to these ' hearts that might have been so thoroughly happy, but for the worm of ambition, that fed secretly upon their choicest flowers. Mr. Benton was not surprised by Leighton's declaration; he had marked. the progress of events, and was quite correct in his impression as to the position of both hearts; this was why he had, with almost a woman's tender- ness, bidden Dr. Nelson quietly wait. Marion had an undefined sensation of fear and reluctance, when her father called her the next morning, and said, in a very grave tone, "My daughter, Mr. Leighton came to me to-day, by your permission." Mrs. Benton arose to leave the room. "Lucy, my dear," he said, turning to his wife, "I have nothing to say to Marion that yout may not hear." But the mother excused herself; she was distrust- ful of her daughter's motives, and she was not a little distressed by her evidently ignoring all differ- ences of faith in one she was to take for life, but here her own example had been faulty. Mr.' Ben- ton -'continued: "You wish my sanction of your -engagement; is it so, my child?" Marion blushed and hesitated. "Not exactly, papa," she said at length;' "I thought perhaps you would think it best not to'have any positive engagement 'at  present. " A shade of doubt, mingled withl-a little severity, crossed the brow of the father at these words, but 25   ,3:o ,9    /-awthorndean. he idid--notib immediately speak. "Let there be :t^u'it'- here,"- ;he said at last; "truth to yourself, -nd:rtoone who who wishes to be your nearest friend. -There:-must ,be no trifling-; you have known - Mr. :};t'gh!tn- intimately for many months; you can have-i:time'^ a definite time-a week, a month- longert if you wish,-but after that your connection w'ith?-^ Mr.^-Leighton must be either -an acknow- !e dged-,?engagement, or he must be to you simply a-di;atant:;iacquaintance." i: IMarion; was silent; here was a view of the case she was -hardly prepared to receive, though in her hieartshe intended, -if every thing prospered as she hoped :it-would, to marry Horatio eventually.

But. will this bread satisfy?" :: His daughter did not reply, a glow of -satisfae- tion filled her heart'at this confirmation' of her opinion of what must be;- she knew her father ato be a man of superior judgment, clear-headed, iand well posted in the ways of the world-, and; his words helped her to a decision, for she sa&w'that. there must be a decisive reply to the great ques- tion now pending. The difference in faith did -not weigh with her, she crushed all-- misgivings odn this point by the thought that mixed marriages are not forbidden by the Catholic Church, though she well knew that She refuses- to sanction- them by the nuptial benediction, which She gives: her more faithful children. In less than two-weeks the engagement was known through the region of Athlacca, bringing from "Old Cap" ' the remark that "he allowed these things would- foller that night on the prairie; a young chap's hands don't shake like Leighton's did for nothin." Doctor Nelson bore his disappointment like a- man, although he withdrew. himself at: once from, his intimacy at Inglewood, to the grief of Mr. Benton and his wife, for they had- become, warmly attached to the young man.; nevertheless the friend- ship remained unbroken, and the Doctor's lonely log-cabin was often brightened-by visits from-these, his two: best friends; he called nowhere' ,himself, except in the way of his profession, and- at the study of: his pastor. -      - 25*   2"      Hr lathznomdean. eT-hT pobr cchild ofb suffering, Alice Leighlton, during ithe a'utumn followning Marion's engagement, without, Van-y apparent cause, from; what appeared to be almost an entire restoration to health under Dolttor!Nelson's tteatment, sunk into the old seden- tary wayss- and made no effort to arouse herselr from,; the lethargy which crept over her. Her mother in vain sought the cause of this change; the DoctorI too was at -fault; even Mrs. Benton won- dered, as she saw her from day to day grow more reservedi to herself, whom she had chosen for her confidant, s' She had for a long time been studying the ground -of her faithl, and was approaching that point where the whole cry of the soul is, "Lord,  give me light." Doctor Nelson having been well- founded 'in, his- faith from childhood, afforded her mich help -but all at once she left consulting any person either physically or spiritually, and shut herself up--as it were to her own thoughts. Mrs. Benton and the physician had many times consulted together with regard to this change, and were making various efforts to bring back the pleasant smile and the warm interest in matters about her,: when suddenly Mrs. Benton was sum- moned' to:, her bedside. The. physician was there before her, and with he'r mother had succeeded in bringipng her out of a protracted ---attack of fainting. :She opened her' blue eyes, and put: 'out her hand eagerly to Mrs.- Benton, as if- sh'e would be once moret'taken to her: heart; 'then, with a motion. of her right hand, expressed a wish to be alone with her friend. "I m-ust:tell you," she whispered, as Mrs.: Benton'   A,- :Step Forward.     29gS stooped to'her'pillow, after all had retired, "I must: tell you, I am going- to die.

As she spoke, the tears came slowly dropping from her closed eyelids,. It was because I could not help it, indeed I could not.: I may say it to you, my more than mother," she added, press- ing to her lips the dear-hand that now held hers; "he was so kind to me, taught me so sweetly,'-led me along. so gently-indeed I could not help loving: him-and it will do no harm now."     ' "My poor, dear child!" said Mrs. Benton, kissing her fondly, and parting'her disordered locks. By. the instinct which: God has given the tender-hearted,. she read the tale of unrequited love through these- broken sentences; read the fact that Dr, Nelson:' had unwittingly won the young girl's affections, and her fond heart'ached for the sufferer. The: countenance of the 'girl brightened as she:felt that her secret was known to her companionm. "You see; my own, friend"' she :added,; "'thoughts of lifeahnd love must 'not press in and mingle with my'dying hour; your presence alone will be, necessary :lin' I take the' vows -of a Christian. I feel that -I can   g6      Hawthorndean         I !ve but afew days, and O, let me do what I have to do, :quickly ahd peacefully." Her look was sadly imploring.  -"tt shall be as you wish, Alice," replied Mrs. Benton,;; :"calm- your spirit by trust in your dear Lordt who never faileth those who cast their care upo'n-Him.- I will send for Father Sheridan at pnceiand foir the rest, you shall not be disturbed." " And you will tell him when I am gone," urged the invalid, the faint pink tinge passing over her cheel;- "he might otherwise feel hurt, that I refused his presence-at such a time, when he has been so interested in-bringing me to this sacrament." - "All shall be as you wish, dear," replied her friend, kissing the pallid brow.  Mrs. Benton's errand was in part a difficult one, to open first to the mother, the resolve of her child (perhaps not unexpected, and yet in all cases sudden at the last) to leave-:the religion of her parents, and'to bear the blame of undue influence; but these were the tightest' part of-her task.: To keep Dr. Nelson from  Alice's room, where he had a right as her physician, was more difficult. Her husband had often said, that under that mild and gentle exterior she possessed a degree of promptitude and energy mingled with delicacy, for the most trying occa- sions. After dispatchinga messenger for the priest, she wentat once- tothe- office of Dr. Nelson, where she fouhnd- him pale- and. dejected. : "That poor 'child is going fast, she cannot live a wneek;'? he said, as Mrs. Benton closed the door; "O, if I could-help her to a decision!"- -"You have helped her, Doctor; you have done   A Step Forwarid.      29g more for her than minister to her bodily ills$;:you have led her to ask for baptism, and I: have-dis- patched a messenger for the priest.", . "Thank God, thank God!" exclaimed -the young man, " this is what I have prayed.-for most-,ear- nestly: O, it will be to me a most welcome sight:!" "But she has specially requested that, no-one may be present but her mother-and myself she is afraid of the intrusion of .worldly thoughts and distractions at. such a time, and has- not even asked for my daughter's presence." -Dr. Nelson looked surprised, and a little disappointed.- - : "I can understand her wishes," continued Mrs. Benton, looking out of the window as she spoke, "and you will know by and by perhaps, why she wishes to be so secluded. I am persuaded it is from no fear of man, but only as I have said, fear of distractions. But I see my messenger returning; yes, and here is Father Sheridan following -close in his wake. I must go over and prepare for the ceremony; in the meantime you know-very, well what is the best thing you can do -for us." "You are always right, always judicious, my dear counsellor," he replied; then rising and going to an inner room, he brought out a smaillsilver crucifix. "Give this to Alice for me, and tell- her I am praying for her."  Mrs. Benton sought- no ,opportunity to give either the message ori the gift till the, solemn s$cene was over., Alice lived but two days after, the reception of the sacraments, but the crucifix was never out of her hand; she seldom spoke,: and clamly and peacefully fell asleep in her baptismal   -2 98      awfhzewtkorndean.

"It can do me no harm now," he said sadly, repeating Mrs. Benton's words--" but I could have sympathized with her-yes, I think I could have loved her very dearly, but it would have been only the remnants, not the dear first love she gave me. Ah! she is far better with that love which is eternal and unchangeable-to go direct from her bapism, to the embrace of her dear Lord, what could, we ask for her!" The, mourning mother brooded over her dead daughter's journal of the past year, and a voice of gentlek:wailing, like a dirge, ran through every page. It: was; an unfathomable .mystery to her even, when she came to a withered bunch of violets among its !eaves,with the initials,'J.

B'* ARION   and her lover had -settled adown, after the first flush of their betrothal, "a heap like old folks," Sobriety said, as in absence came the regular letter, and when present- the regular visit, and always the- regular newspaper,which Marion studied with great dili- gence., Rosine had heard of the engagement in her city home, and talked it' over with Colonel Hartland, who pronounced Leighton as promising a young man as he had met for years. But the business- like courtship was not to be continued unbroken; late in the autumn came a pressing letter from Colonel Hartland, urging his friend to allow Marion to pass the winter at the east. He was coming to St. Louis on government business, and would bring her back with,.him. :It was only right, he said, that she -should, have a few glimpses of life before taking her-pila'ce,.amo ng the matrons. Mr. Benton and his wife looked at each other wist- fully, as if waiting for a question, when they had read the letter. " What do you think of it, -Lucy?" he said, lean- 299   3 300 ..    Haithorndean, i ... . .. . ingw ars:er, and clasping her hand in his;" it is Fair, t-oeast your only :emaining: daughter." "[:isInot that alone malies me hesitate, Philip; while I have you I can never be lonely. I am think- ing separation and contact with the world might be the best test of her love for Mr. Leighton." "Better now than after marriage,"'! quickly replied Mr. Benton, "I have often doubted the depth and and endurance of her love for-him, but never of his." "Perhaps it would be well to leave the decision entirely with Marion," said the wife; "such a visit might benefit her in many ways, and-'be a comfort to Rosine." ' "Yes," replied the father, in a tone of relief; "a winter together would be wholesome   for both the girls. It is really a pity that Hartland has no daughter of his own; his son's marriage does not promise much comfort; I trust the Doctor,: if he ever marries, will do better." Mrs. :Benton answered only with a  half-sup- pressed sigh, changed to a smile as Marion entered, ruddy and glowing, from  a sharp canter with her lover across -the prairie. '"O. beautiful! glorious!" she exclaimed, as her quick thought took in the contents of the letter her mother had put into her hand, saying, "We shall leave the answer to you, my daughter." ' "But can I  go?" she inquired, eagerly, and then blushing crimson, as she met the earnest Iodk of her father.        . "Your mother and I think it best to'leave the decision with you,".said her father. ,    -The Sisters;      301 "Then H shall surely go," she cried, clapping her hands and running to the door to meet Mr. Leighton. "Think of it, Horatio l: a winter in Isn't it enough to make me giddy?" "And me giddier?" he said, in his outspoken honest way, as she stood before him. "Why will you torture me; you know you will not go!" "But indeed I will," she replied; "look at this;" and she gave him the letter of invitation. All that evening he plead and reasoned to no purpose with the refractory, determined spirit of Marion; she was not to be shaken; she even ques- tioned his love for her, that was so selfish as to wish to keep her immured in Athlacca, when she had such an opportunity for improvement as well as enjoyment. She played the injured one, till the lover almost persuaded himself he had wronged. his beloved, in wishing to keep her from what was so much for her good. "Old Cap" soon heard the news, and  came "pegging it over," as lhe said, to search out the truth of the matter.      9 "This beats all my first wife's relations!" he exclaimed, as he approached the door in which Marion and Horatio were seated,' he teaching her to tie a sailor's knot. "Takin' track for the east! he, Miss! Well, I must say it's nigh time, since you've bejuggled half the young men in these diggins; put the Doctor into a fever that none of his truck'll cure, I'll be bound, and madp -an old man of this chap before his day; it's time you started. You foller, I s'pgse?" he, added ,to Leighton.      - 26   362      H-awthborndean. 'i What am I to do? She will not take me with her," replied Leighton, with an attempt to smile, while he- extended one hand to Rice, and in the other held the strands of the yet untied knot. "Cant - you tie a knot as can't untie?" said Rice, looking quizzically at Marion. "You know thar's-many a slip." The young couple blushed crimson, and the words sank deep into Leighton's heart. It was evident to himself that he did not fully trust Marion; perhaps the fervor and strength of his own affection made him more doubtful of hers. Harold was at home for a few weeks at this time, a fine-grown youngman, nearly as tall as his father, with his mother's brown eyes, and Rosine's golden hair. He was filled with high hopes and great expectations, having chosen his profession as civil engineer, and was determined, with the strength of a powerful will, to be among the first therein. He had made warm friends in St. Louis, and he scorned Marion's desire to go east; he never cared to see any thing east but Rosine and Willie; the great growing west was his Eldorado. He turned and annoyed Marion by asking her if, when she was Mrs. Governor of Illinois, she would use her influence to give him the laying out of the railroads through the State. A little depression came over Marion a few days before she left home, and her mother was relieved by even this symptom of heart; for it had been a surprise to her how, with the' Chosen object to be left behind, there should be such readiness for- a separation. Horatio and Harold accompanied her on her way as far   The Sisters.      303 as Chicago, where they were to meet Colonel Hartland, who by some change of plan was to go to that city instead of St. Louis, as at first proposed, and therefore could not come to Athlacca. It was with- a heavy heart Leighton returned to his now lonely life, when the last wave of the white signal disappeared with the retreating steamer. His energetic and untiring nature could only be satisfied by constant unwavering efforts for the position he was determined to occupy. Marion was welcomed by Colonel Hartland's family, not as a stranger, but for Rosine's sake, like one belonging to themselves; and but few days passed, when with her pushing nature she had im- pressed even Mrs. Hartland with a sense of her energy and power: to her sister she made known the state of things at Inglewood, gave her a des- cription of Leighton, caricatured Dr. Nelson, and talked so much about herself, as to leave such an impression of her importance upon Rosine's mind, as to lead her to wonder how she could very well be spared from Athlacca. "Rosa," she said, a little reproachfully, after noting for one week in silence, the pet ways and fond expressions of Doctor Hartland toward her sister, "I told you, without reserve all about Horatio, our engagements and plans, and you have never even hinted to me that Dr. Hartland, or Ned, as he bids me call him, is a lover of yours, and that you are as good as engaged."       . "What possibly put that into yo-dr head?" re- plied Rosine, with eyes dilated with surprise, and with a start and almost a scream. "He is old   304      Hawthorndean. enough to be-not quite my father, as he once said, but he is fifteen years older than I, and never had a thought or dream of me except as a younger sister." "Nor you of him?" inquired Marion, with a slight touch of sarcasm in her tone. "No," replied Rosine, hurt by the tone and the implied suspicion; " never, I love him to be sure; how could I help it? he is so kind to me, but not inm that way.  Why, Marion it -is absurd!" she added eagerly. "By no means absurd," said the sister, laughing at her earnestness and evident confusion; ,"he is a -splendid fellow: I don't mean handsome, though he isn't ugly; but he's so genial, funny, and sensi- ble; and then of course he's rich, all these years in his profession, here, and high up in it too; I wonder he has not married before; if I were you-" "O don't,- sister!" exclaimed Rosine, fearfully, putting both hands over her sister's mouth; "don't say any more. I don't like to have such thoughts about him, they would mar the freedom of our intercourse, and I am afraid now, I shall think of them when we meet." "What a funny child you are," said Marion, putting her arm affectionately about her waist; "but I reckon if papa were to see you together, you might have one of his severe lectures on coquetry and flirting, such as he gave me." "Coquetry! flirting!" exclaimed Rosine, with- drawing a  little from the 'snug embrace; "I think they are both wicked: and I  am sure this is no such -thing."   The Stlers. -      305  Tell me about this Miss Greenwood and her brother," said Marion, seeing how deeply she had wounded her sister, and desirous of changing the subject. "I heard the Doctor joking you about him, when the note came to you to-day from. her." Rosine was glad of any change in the conversa- tion, and though her feelings were smarting under the imputation of a flirt, she was still desirous to conciliate her sister, therefore she drew from her pocket the paper, questioning if she really had a right to read Dora's note to Marion. The sister observed the hesitation with which she moved, and said petulantly, "I wish I had staid at Inglewood; you are afraid to confide in me; new friends have taken the place of old." O' O, Marion I my dear, my only sister, don't say thlat. I was only thinking if it were right for me to talk, even to you, of other people's affairs." "How supremely silly!" replied Marion. "You worry yourself about trifles with an intensity A worthy of Dr. Nelson. He was scrupulous to a degree; tormenting himself about little atoms of conduct, and would hardly trust himself to look at me, or speak to me, after my engagement; ceased  his visits almost entirely, and made himself ob- served by every- one; underwent all kinds of self- imposed penance, to punish himself for falling in love with me." "Mamma  writes as if papa were very fond of him," said Rosine. "Mercy! yes," replied Marion; "I never saw him take to any one as he did to him.

Rosine did not reply, her mind was wandering back through the two years of separation, and the reflection, "How changed!" seemed to strike her dumb; she feared they could never come together again as when they were children. In Marion's breast was something of the same thought, "How changed!" but they were both mistaken; time had not changed, but only developed their natural traits of character. They were preparing to retire for the night, and as Rosine did not begin the reading of the note, Marion took the pins from her luxu- riant mass of chestnut hair, and commenced her toilet, saying very indifferently, "EYou may do as you please about reading me the note, or telling me any thing of your new friends." Rosine' was willing to do any thing -but do wrovng to soothe her sister, and she commenced slowly, without looking up: -NAVY YARD, December, 18-. MY SWEET YOUNG FRIEND:  -"I must congratulate you on your reunion with your sister, of which I heard to-day from   Tkhe Sisters.      307; Sist:er Agnes. I hope I may yet have a little-place in your thoughts. Come and see, me with your sister, you know you are always welcome. Mrs. Laura Hartland was with me yesterday, she misses you constantly, but your friends are right,: your young fresh heart should not be made the recipient' of sorrows like hers. I wish I could comfort her, but naturally she is very anxious about the Lieu- tenant just now,"-she hesitated. "Go on," said Marion eagerly, "I have been wishing to ask an explanation of some expressions I heard the Doctor use yesterday; it seems that she had desired to go to her husband, and the Colonel prevented it." "I knew nothing of it!" replied Rosine with surprise. "Well, I picked it up from the end of a con- versation; but go on," she added impatiently. "*There is nothing more of Laura here," said Rosine, and continued her reading-"We hear from Harry almost every steamer; he is getting on finely, is at present at Strasburg, working hard at his profession." "Profession!" cried Marion, looking around from the glass, "I thought he was in the Navy!" "He was in the service," replied Rosine, "but resigned on account of the war with Mexico, which he could not justify to his conscience." "Very foolish of him!" said the sister, in a tone slightly contemptuous. "What had he to do with the right or wrong of the matter? If he obeyed orders, the responsibility rested with the govern- ment."    3p8.      fHawthormdeoan. O :    u"Youreasog like the Commodore," said Rosine, laughing, ",tHe was mortally angry with his son." "I don't wonder," replied the sister; "it is a great hinderance to the rise of a- man to change his profession after being established. Does he -live on his' father in the- meantime?" Rosine's face flushed with indignation as she replied, "You don't know-Harry Greenwood. He is above all meanness." "He has a warm advocate in- you, at least," said Marion, looking keenly at Rosine, who blushed painfully; "but. go on, let's hear what his sister says of him." : More reluctantly than ever, Rosine continued her reading, still loath to offend her sister by seem- ing to want confidence-"He thinks to stay in Europe two or three years. Father is a shade more reconciled, at least he does not speak of my brother with the severity that so distressed me. Come to me soon, my dear one, and I will tell you more of -his daily life. You will find a loving welcome from your attached, DORA GREENWOOD." It was true, as Marion had surmised from what she had overheard, that Laura had desired to go to her husband. Since Le Cpompte's departure, her anxieties for Aleck had redoubled, and she had eiven gone so far as to secure a passage in a steamer bound for the Gulf of Mexico. Sister Agnes could not persuade her to the contrary; with all the energy of her former days, she was determined; there was' but one thing to be " .    Thee Sisters.   - - 309 done, -Colonel Hartland must be informed of her intentions. The good Sister performed the painful task as a matter of plain duty. No sooner was he aware of her plan, than he called upon her, and used every argument to dissuade her from her purpose, begged her to consider that Aleck was in the midst of preparations for carnage and blood. Finding that he made no impression, he changed his tactics, and told her plainly that under the circumstances the world would say, and not with- out .reason, that she followed Le Compte. This was "the unkindest cut of all," but it kept her where she was. A,   CHAPTER XXIV. BEFORE THE CASTLE OF VERA CRUZ. WE must carry our readers to the Gulf of Mexico, where, before the Castle of Vera Cruz, the X-- was anchored, preparing for'the siege that was to make so many bleeding hearts. The spirit of conquest of people and territory was the spirit of the Mexican war; not to: subdue enemies, or to defend one's own, but to attack a harmless population. Of course there could be but little true patriotism in such a war; there was but small heart in it, as many of the officers themselves acknowledged. We can compare it to nothing but a fight. between a bull- dog and a small terrier; but with the moral or politi- cal aspects of the war our narrative has but little to do. ' Lieutenant Alexander Hartland was at Vera Cruz, foremost in that terrible siege of five days, and bore his part so well that he was. pro- moted to the "Captaincy," with the addition of a ball in his thigh, which threatened to lame him for life. Either care, or the sickly climate, or some nameless wear of the soul, had told on his lithe and vigorous frame, and he was illy prepared to bear his wound.  It was at this juncture that the 310   Before the, Castle of Myera Cruz.  3jI1 new surgeon arrived. From, that time Captain Hartland grew almost dumb, and the, lines -about bhis mouth and chin deepened daily; he became stern with his men, and reticent with his brother officers, treating Le Compte With chilling coldness, cutting off every effort of the surgeon to draw him into conversation, repelling all inquiries as to the condition of his wound, and savagely hoping Le Compte might become amenable, by some infringe- ment of rule, to a court-martial. But the surgeon was too wise for him; through all his icy coldness lhe was as courteous to the Captain as possible, always saluting him in a deferential and kindly way, returning his gruffness with forbearance, and a certain kind of humility which said, -"I know I have injured you, and I will do all I can to repair it in your person." There were times when the Captain was almost frantic, so exasperating were his thoughts, and nothing but the strict discipline of a man-of-war could have prevented a violent outhreak. It was specially galling to Aieck to feel- that he was coming more and more within the power of the man he had come to hate; his wound was growing day by day- more troublesome for the want of proper treatment, and the fever of the climate had made its appearance on ship-board-either might bring him into the Doctor's hands any day. And they came at last, both together; the wound broke out afresh, and delirium and fever came upon him; his heart had been taxed too far. After he was transferred to the ship's hospital the fever ran higher, the bounding pulse became sharper each   3 Air2     H awthondean. iday, till two of his brother officers twice stood over him, watching for the last breath. But Le Conmpte, who had tended him faithfully, assured them that thie worst was yet to come--when the raging fever had burned :cut, and he should come to himself; -and his words proved true. That night was the tturning point; three} times the nurse said he was -gone, but Lie Compte plied him with stimulants, and to his unwearied efforts he owed his life. The first glimpse of returning reason was shown in the averted face; when the surgeon stooped over him with the necessary draught. The Doctor saw this, and' withdrew at once, leaving the close care with the nurse, and only--appearing- when the Captain was sleeping, and withdrawing altogether as soon -as he was able to speak. The first word was " let- ters," but when the package was given him,.he -could only hopelessly touch them. The- alcove where his cot was placed was in a dim and dark- -ened corner, and he held the letters near him many ldays, till he was able to ask for more light. As his brain began to act, a restlessness which retarded llis recovery manifested itself, and the surgeon :gave permission for more light. A mirror hung opposite, and the reflection of his unshorn, emaci- ated face amazed him; -he hardly knew himself. To recall his identity he raised his hand to stroke his unclipped beard, when he started as if a ser- ;.pent had stung him, though the curtains were down, and no human eye was on him, for there, aon the fourth finger of -his- left hand, above the seal nng whilch he always wore, was a plain gold ring; there could be no mistake, for in spite of the i   Before itte Castle of Vcra Cruz . 33 tremor which seized him, he drew it from his finger, and read, ' Vincet omnia, vincit am :" He ground his teeth with rage, not against Le Compte, but against the false, degraded, worthless woman who could part with that ring; it;was burn- ing, searing proof of her infidelity. Her whom he had trusted through all, had restored to his shaken confidence when all but he frowned upon her; he needed no further proof, his decision was made. The disclosure carried him into a relapse, and for many days he lay speechless, taking no notice of any one. Captain Jones came to him 'again, when Le Compte had by assiduity brought Hart- land where he could think and speak. With a wayward, wayworn heart, he felt no gratitude for his recovery, he wished he had been carried out with the dead. "Read these for me," he said to Captain Jones, pointing to a package of home letters, "and put these into an envelope, and return them unopened to Mrs. Laura Hartland," heWadded sternly;, theyr had come from his wife during his illness. The letters from his father's hand, full of paternal love and solicitude, were evidently written with a perfect knowledge of the most minute circumstances of his son's position. "Thank that friend," (he wrote more than once) "whoever he is, who writes so partic- ularly to relieve our anxiety." "Le Compte," said Aleck very decidedly, when Captain Jones looked up from the sheet, as if he would inquire who was this friend. "Impossible!" replied the Captain, equally decided in his tone.   34 - ;-   awthomdean.

"The- proof is unquestionable, not a word has passed between us, but he-say no more," he added, feeling he was taxing himself tob far, ' henceforth, :am ia ifree man." II His deCision was irrevocable, his tone so -frigid, 'so' sev'ere;: that his friend did not argue. From -:that -day the relation between the Surgeon and his Captain Was an amicable one.

Colonel Hartland's family was not as gay as it would have been, but for the anxiety that brooded over the society-inwhich -they mixed; anxiety for sons, husbands, fathers, and bro- thers, preparing for battle; war might. commence at any moment where Aleck was, although: as .yet all was quiet. Mrs. Colonel Hartland prepared togive a small but brilliant party, especially; as: she: said, for bringing out Rosine, there were toblEbutnfew invitatons and those veiry select; she thait  was due to Rosine and. to society that she should make this exertion now, as circumstances, might hereafter prevent her  doing it at all, i i her secret heart she desired that Marion and Rosa shou!d make the acquaintance of some other mnarrageable gentleman'besides her son.

"'She wont come, even for her love for Rosa. She might, without any fear of ne," he added, with a slight curl of the lip. Mrs. Hartland sighed as much as she ever per- mitted herself to sigh. "I wish Lieutenant Green. wood were here," she said, after a pause. "Mr. Greenwood, if you please, mother; there is no Lieutenant Greenwood now." ' "Don't you think he was quite charmed with Rosine?" inquiredf Mrs. Hartland, dipping'her pen into the ink for the twentieth time. The Doctor turned sharply around, and -azed at his mother a little fiercely for a moment, then suf- fering, his countenance to relax into a smile, he said, '"Women are forever making or breaking matches for themselves or other people, let Rosa alone in that way, I beg of you.

Dr. Hartland moved onye side, but did not greet them as usual; his bad humor did, not leave him till he saw Rosine pulling away at her gloves. "Here, let me help you," he said, somewhlat gruff, taking her small hands in his; " these things hhve nearly grown to your fingers -'. "She -.has been holding the ribands," said the Colonel; "I offered her my furs, but she declined." -Ned held her hands, chafing and squeezing them alternately, -till all at once .the thought Marion had suggested to Rosine the previous night rushed into her, head, causing her to cast down her eyes, blush painfully, and attempt to disengage her handS A flash like an electric battery shot across the Doctors- mind, and his-first impulse: was -to loose the hands he held, the next to retain them- ;and "if possible,' fathom the meaning of that blush Her. feeble: resistance was in vainand she was almost ready'to drop tears of vexation with herself, not unmingled with anger against Marion, for the suggestions. - ;'W-e-came across Cousin Tom in the Park," said the Colonel, who was gradually thawing out; "he had: the -most splendid turnout in the crowd, and insisedrupon my sparing one of my ladies.' ' 'You didn't 'do it?': exclaimed Dr. Hartland, 'his countenance changing, and turning quickly to his fat-her without releasing Rosine.   Cousin Tom.       3i19 "O, yes, I did," said the Colonel, in a soothing tone. "It was Tonm's first appearance on- the street; he was driving down here, and was -all right; Marion being nearest, he assisted her into the' sleigh with his usual gallantry. He luts -a dash with his Indian- driver and' footman in livery; and you had a charming ride I know, didn't you?"' he added, turning to Marion.   : She began at. once to expatiate on the splendid equipage, the attention they attracted on the street, and to say that the gentleman' would call to-mor- row, it being now too near the dining hour.' "I'm glad it wasn't you," whispered the Doctor to Rosine; which simple speech renewed  the blushes that-had faded from her cheek, and' she- wished Marion back in Illinois most heartily-; snatching her hands away, before tie Doctor was aware of her intention, she was out-'of the room, and up stairs, weeping bitterly, and thoroughly homesick for her mother's heart to rest upon. It-is easy to plant a -thought in the heart -of another that -will mar their happiness for life, and which. all their efforts cannot root out; but through the course of self-discipline Rosine had been taught by the Church, she had learned that evil thoughts, though they may "assault," they cannot hurt the soul that has learned the true secret of daily life, the constant offering of even the small- trials and temptations, to be- united with those- of our: dear Lord. . With an earnest desire to- do right--above' even the wish to be happy, Rosine set herself deliberately to -think out the way to rid' herself of the impression Marion had left on her mind by her   A3:o      Haewthorndeah, iUjudgsed/:comments. , "Between me and Doctor Hartland," she said to herself, "there would alw ays,:be, .Dora, my dear Dora, and his uncon- fessed,.butcertain love for her, which I have often seeatlin unguarded moments;"She knew he had Mis .Green;wood's miniature, for once in a moment of confidence he had taken it from his bosom, to show her- how much Dora. was in her youth like Harry., TIis was enough; as to her own heart she felt she was free. One half-hour's quiet medi- tation, and with a short petition to her guardian. angel:-for, help, she returned to the library, went immediately forward with her old sisterly way to Ned, and asked him to go with her after dinner to the Orphans' Home, of which she had just heard the destruction. The Doctor looked at her a little sharply, then quizzicaly, but was only too happy to obey her 'behest. iThe Colonel had given each of the girls a note that morning, to procure material for a new dressasfor the proposed party, and as Rosine held tight ,to, Doctor Hartland's arm, hurrying over the slippery side-walks, she said, "Ned, I want to: ask you. something."  ; "I'm Salways ready for anything you may have to say,'- he replied. "Do you wish to know why I was .glad you did not ride with cousin Tom?" -ThaRtwas. not my question," she said, "but I shold' like: to;kno. Isn't-he nice?

Faher sayshe hasn't bad .heart, but I don't know how a man can make a fool of himself:   'Cousin Tom.       321 with drink, and not have a bad heart, but they: say he has reformed!" "And if he is reformed?" said Rosine, geintly. "'You know I believe inprobation; and'as not many years since he was ofttimes in the gutters of this Sodom, I prefer to wait awhile before-:trust- ing pure girls in his society. He's worth a million at least, and father's his only relative, so I suppose I must endure him and you must meet him. I only wished to caution you." "Thank you, Ned; he isn't married, of course?" "No, Heaven forbid," said the Doctor, "he'is a confirmed old 'bachelor, :almost as old as the, Col- onel. Butyou had something to tell me, and we are almost at the Home. Rosa, did Sister Agnes ever ask you to join the sisterhood?" "No, indeed, never," replied she, in a tone of wonderment; " what could put that into your mind? It is not my vocation; I have too many friends, and love them too well." "Yes, it is a very unnatural state," said -he, shaking his head, "contrary to nature." "Now, Ned, there is no use in you and me con- troverting about this matter. I believe it to be a state higher than -nature, to which not many are called. You do not believe me?"- she added -in- quiringly, as he did not reply; "you have been reading those miserable books of escaped -nuns." "No, Rosa, I leave that for the divines; I credited the nonsense slightly, till I was called to one of those same escaped nuns in the way of m y pro- fession. But here-weare at the very:corner, and I have. not yet heard your question."   ,:3.2      HrczawltZornl zdean. O; ' 0Id-eadful t', exclaimed Rosine, as they came upon the, mass of blackened and' still smoking rui ts ,", "What a wonderful escape! no life lost, and all; those ,childrento get out!? I -wanted to ask you if the Colonel would much mind my not having a new:dress for the party; I want to give this note to Sister Agnes-, nobody will look at- me?" - "I shall, for one,"- he replied, as they stood at the scorched entrance of the only wing that re- mained:of that once noble structure; "nevertheless I will deny myself with you this time, and lose -the- sight of you in a new dress." R-osine; found herself amid a scene of suffering when she-entered the large second floor, where she had once seen all those tiny beds with their dainty coverings, several of the Sisters being disabled, Sister Agnes most of all. A relay of nuns from another religious house were already on the spot, tending- and nursing with their, gentle care; and Miss Greenwood was there, making herself gen- erally useful. Dr. Hartland knew this when he assented to the walk; he had met her in the morn- ing, but he-was not prepared to find Laura in close counsel with Dora. His face. assumed'at once a cold, proud look, as he bowed and passed on to the beds of the stricken ones, leaving Rosine to greet her friends as she pleased. The Doctor found SisterAgnes in a bad way; she had exerted herself since the morning for the others, till the wounds, that- might with quiet have healed rapidly, had already produced a marked fever. The phy- sicianm ordered at once a separate apartment, for her; but she resisted, saying she-required no more    Cosint T3om n    313 than the other Sisters, and must be wherehe could look to her flock. The Doctor refused'*to argue the matter, but calling in the 'eounsel of Father Roberts, who had come to-:gitve the last sacraments-to one of the nuns whose long expected death had -been hastened by the fright of the previous night, together they carried the day, without argument, and the Sister Superior was removed to a room by herself. Rosine left her gift in the hand of her pastor, and Dr.,Hartland added a note of equal value. -' I wish we could give up the party," she said as they hurried home again; " it does seem dread- ful to think we may be so gay, when perhaps Aleck is at the same moment, under fire from the Castle; and then the money could be spent for the poor orphans." "I see," replied the Doctor, laughing, "they mean to have you among them yet;- all, your thoughts are there. But tell me, did that woman give you. any news from 'Vera Cruz"?' -Hs tone grew bitter as he spoke. "Yes, Ned," she said, without appearing to notice his manner, " she has had letters to-day, and Aleck bade her not to be anxious if she did not hear again for weeks, as the siege might-'commence any day." "The false 'Woman did not tell you that Le Compte was there, wearing her poor husband, - whom she so cruelly wronged, into the grave-by his presence.' There was no reply. Rosine was both angry and grieved, almost frightened, at the thought of Lieutenant Hartland in constant contact   324      tZawthorndean, with Le Compte; but she had less and less heart for the party, and was quite relieved when the Colonel said that \evening, that he was sorry for the girls, but he thought they must give, the matter up altogether. Marion was quite annoyed at this result, but the constant attentions of Staple.- ton partially satisfied her; she was always ready for a ride or a walk, or a game of chess, in which she was such a proficient that Mr. Stapleton was led to declare in tke presence of the family, that he could not have believed a woman could have played so sharp a game. "You, are old enough," replied the Doctor, catch- ing at his-words, "to know that they play at any game better than we, good or bad. Did you ever see a man who could flirt like a woman, or lie like a woman, or cheat like a woman, if she chooses to try her hand at these things?" Stapleton was cowed for a moment, he was afraid of his Cousin Ned; but Marion's face burnt with crimson, and she retorted, "You are dread- fully cynical, Ned. I should think your acquaint- ance among the ladies had not been of the best." "I have seen some pretty poor specimens," he replied slowly, looking at her intently from under his raised eyebrows, and with that penetrating glance from which she. shrunk. Matters went on thus through the winter; con- certs, a  few ,private dinner parties, with an occa- sional. dance, served the young girls for recreation. Cousin Tom made himself useful in many ways, With: his- good-natured, indolent habits, and his   Cousin Tom.       325 'heaps of money, and he had contrived to find it "not altogether dull," as he told his outside friends. Rosine did not divulge to her sister the failings of his past life, which the Doctor had made known to her, but she shrunk from him, and was always reserved, even when it came to be an almost every day occurrence that he dropped in after dinner and staid till late in the evening. The sisters never talked over Mr. Stapleton, though Rosine had at times been reminded of what Doctor Hartland had told her, by a freedom of manner on his part which- she felt that her sister should resent, and she was questioning in her mind if it were not her- duty to speak, when a remark of the Colonel's decided her. "Marion," he had said laughingly, " if you were in the market, Tom is not too old to try his hand; you know men are never too old to hope." "Ah," she replied, with a mock serious tone, "but twenty and fifty! the difference is too great; besides, I shan't think of such'a thing without Mr. Leighton's permission." This jest had brought the blood to Rosine's cheek, and fixed the firm resolve in her heart. The time came when they were alone, -preparatory to retiring for the night; she hesitated, but Marion was before her. "I declare," she exclaimed, throwing herselfinto the large arm-chair, where Rosine and Laura; had often sat together, "if I were in the market, I would set my cap for Mr. Stapleton; I rather like him, and I know-." She hesitated, while Rosine put her hands over her face and burst into tears. 28   , zv     l-a2Itfomdean. "You 'silly child, what is the matter?" said Marion, leaning over her sister, and speaking coax- ingly.  "Marion, it is perfectly frightful?" she sobbed as soon as tears would let her speak. "What is frightful?" asked Marion. "Why, to hear you talk in this way. Are you not solemnly engaged to Mr. Leighton?" "To be sure I am. Have I denied it?" "Then how can you speak, or even think of another in that way?" "One cannot help one's thoughts," replied Marion, sulkily. - "Cannot help one's thoughts P" exclaimed Rosine Why, sister dear, are not wicked thoughts in- dulged, the very root and fountain of wicked actions?' "Well, suppose they are, I haven't said I want the man, or that I would break my engagement; I was only imagining what might have been. You preach morality to me, my little saint, but don't you think I can see how that small heart of yours flut- ters between the attractions of the architect, when the letters come from abroad, and the more tangible attentions of the physician, who is close at hand?" "I will not hear this!" said Rosine, rising in great anger, her lips quivering with emotion. "I came to warn you of danger, but all I can say will be of no use. 1 am only repaid by insult!" and taking her candle, she left the room without another word. Marion would not recall her impudent words, although she was a little .pained by their result;   Cousin Tomn.      327 they burned .down deep into her sister's heart, and for the first time they closed their eyes to sleep alienated from each other. After Rosine had gone away, her sister took out a letter she had that day received from Mr. Leighton, and reread it. It ran thus: -ATHLACCA, January, 18-. "MY DEAR LOVE: "Your long absence and infrequent letters dis- hearten me. I do not go about business with the courage I would if you were by my side. Don't think I would deprive you of a moment's happi- ness where you are, I only wish to share it. Who is this 'Cousin Tom,' of whom you write so freely? Is he a young man?  You see already I am anxious on that point, not but I -trust you, but dear Marion, how can I help envying the man who can sit by your side and chat with you, while I, who have the best right, am exiled? You ask for news. I have just chme to Athlacca from S  , and have only heard: that Sobriety had been detected in efforts for a clandestine marriage with her Cousin Dan; the girl is not yet fifteen, and your father thought it should be stopped; but she is shrewd enough to elude us all. As a magistrate, I gave my opinion. Fifteen is quite an old bride in these parts. "Dr. Nelson is aspious. as ever. Father Sheri- dan told him in my hearing that he should have been a priest-'I think so too. He -has- no tie in the world but his little sister Philomena, who is visiting your mother, for whom the young thing has con- e   328       . awthorndean. ceived a strong affection. Who could help it? Were it not for your mother, my separation from you would be unendurable, but she always gives me strength and hope. 'Old Cap' casts his 'pity' at me every time we meet, says I look 'cut up,' which is the truth. When- may I come for you, my Marion? My circumstances warrant our marriage whenever you will name the day. Tell me when it shall be, dearest. Your faithful, HORATIO LEIGHTON.'- As she closed this letter, two tear-drops started to Marion's eyes, but she dried them instantly, and as hastily thrust the letter-into a drawer, and went about her toilet for the night. She was not in an enviable state of mind, although she knew from her womanly instinct, as well as from words to which she had that day listened, that she could, if she chose, be mistress of the golden store pertain- ing to Thomas Stapleton, Gent. No direct offer had been made, how could he so insult her, when he knew of her engagement? She tried, as she slowly brushed away her long hair, deliberately to consider her case in all its bearings upon that which was her goal-worldly advance- ment. Here was an opportunity that the west in those days could not afford her, an establishment in any city of the Union, an establishment with an inexhaustible fortune, and nobody with any claim to it but herself! Ah, what wonderful things she could do with it!-and she fell asleep. dreaming of convents and churches in the distance, which she was straining -her eyes to look at, but could 'not   Cousin Tom.       329 see for the dark pall that hung between them and her weary gaze. The sisters met as usual in the morning, but Rosine, although she tried to forgive, still carried the sting of those unjust words. She could not hide the disturbance from Dr. Hartland's observant eye. He came to her immediately after breakfast, where she'stood leaning against the window frame after the family had left the room. He put his arm across her shoulders, and said kindly but jocosely, "Quarrelled, Rosa?"She did not reply, but he saw her burning cheek, and the tear just ready to start, and he added, more seriously, "Can I help you, dear sister?" "Thank you, Ned, I am foolish. Marion hurt my feelings sadly last night, when I meant it for her good." "Preaching to your elders, eh?" he replied, turn- ing her about, and sitting down by her side in the recess of the window. "No, not preaching, Ned; I feel a little about Marion, as I did about Laura in the early part of Aleck's absence, and-and--." "It is the same game over again," he said, sternly. "I hate it, so do you; all right-you spoke to her about it? Noble sister! 1 should have done it, only she is our guest, and I should certainly get very angry if I undertook it, and say something she would never forgive. Have you ever told her of Tom's former habits?" "I have told her nothing, Ned; only remon- strated."  "And she was very angry?" 28*   330u xawithorndea. ' Yes; buit I should not so much have cared for that, if she had not accused me of the same thing." Rosine looked frightened the moment the words were out of her mouth, and heartily wished them recalled. "Accused you, Rosa--accused you of flirting? With whom, pray? Me, of course. Ha, ha, ha!" he added, laughing heartily; " that is too funny! I suppose she can't imagine any bond but that of lovers between you and me; she can't think of any other love than that; but we understand it per- fectly, don't we, Rosa?" he said, leaning over her. Yes, Ned, perfectly; I think." "Then we need not trouble ourselves about others. But perhaps she thinks I keep you from lovers. I hope I may, from such as Tom Sta- pleton." "But she accuses me of carrying on a flirtation between you and Harry Greenwood." "What does she know about Harry?" he exclaimed, turning and gazing at her with 'his piercing glance. "Nothing," replied Rosine, casting down her eyes under his gaze; "only she knows that I am glad when you get letters from him, and read them :o me." "A great, foundation upon which to accuse you if a flirtation. Upon my word, she is very impu- lent, and I shall tell her so, if she tries to make a ledge between you and me." "She cannot do it," said Rosine, bravely; "no ne can." "Thank you for that," he replied, taking -both   Cousin Tom.       331 her hands in his; "thank you, Rosa, you: have not said such a sweet word for this long time. I thought once, only for one- little minute, that such a hedge was growing. It was the day the Asylum was burnt, when you snatched your hands from me in such an unsisterly manner. Was that hedge some of this young lady's planting? I thought so," he added, as Rosine made no answer; "and now, once for all, whoever says a word to mar or destroy the perfect brotherly and sisterly feeling between us, is our enemy. Isn't it so? I can't allow any man to marry you," he continued, laugh- ing, "without a clear understanding in this matter." Rosine smiled through the lingering tear-drop that hung on her eye-lid, and determined that nothing should ever mar the comfort of her sisterly intercourse with dear brother Ned. ;'A   CHAPTER XXVI. - UNHEEDED   WARNINGS. AT length came to the household of Colonel Hartland the-news of the terrible siege of Vera Cruz, with the list of killed and wounded,- and what is of more import- ance to our story, the tale of Lieutenant Hartland's promotion to "Captaincy," and his troublesome wound. During these weeks of suspense no more was said, of Marion's flirtation with Stapleton, so ab- sorbed were the family in thoughts of the suffering member. Marion rode with her new lover, walked and talked with him almost unobserved, until one evening Dr. Hartland met him in the hall, and knew by his manner and the tone of his voice that his old habits were reviving. He found Marion alone in the library, from whence the gentleman had but just emerged; closing the door and speak- ing very sternly, he said, "Marion, did you know that fellow was half-drunk? I am surprised that you: allow him the liberty of a private interview in his present. condition." . Marion colored with anger, and rose haughtily. 332   Unheeded Warnxings.    333 "I think you are mistaken, or that you misrepresent your cousin; I saw no traces of that of which you accuse him." "There are none so blind as those who will not see," he replied sarcastically. "The fellow is here altogether too much for your good. If you wish to jilt an honest man and marry this spark, who- has been and is like to be again a common drunk- ard, why, you can take your choice; but you shall know what he is before you leap; and if you doubt my word, as you seem inclined to do, ask the Colonel or my mother. It is all humbuggery about reform; I've seen him muddled several Atimes this winter; but he was badly off to-night, he had to catch by the railing; I hope the police will have him in- safe keeping before morning." Marion stalked haughtily from the room, she was intensely angry, and felt herself highly in- sulted. "What fools girls are!" soliloquized Dr. Hart- land. "What can there'be in this ancient jacka- napes that is attractive to a bright, pretty young creature! Certainly she is a candidate for Bedlam, if she means really to give up that likely western chap and marry this ass. I protest, a man can't be too thankful, who hasn't daughters to look after!" "The sons give us trouble sometimes," said the cheery voice of the Colonel, who had entered the door Marion had left ajar in her hurried exit, unobserved, and had overheard the last sentence of the soliloquy. "Are you scolding yourself, my son?" he added, approaching the Doctor.   334      mawwornaean. :"Not exactly: I am angry that this girl Marion should be making such a miserable wretch of herself, by jilting a likely man and taking up with our poor drunken cousin Tom, who has been closeted with her here, half seas over." "This is only suspicion, Ned," said the Colonel, looking at his son with astonishment; "you don't really think there is any thing of this sort going on?" "It is suspicion founded on constant observation, sir; by watching the weather-vane you can soon- tell which way the wind sits." "Philip Benton's child ought not to be brought into such a position in my house," said the Colonel, thoughtfully; "but if there is any thing in it, it may not be too late to break it up. I shall forbid him to come here at allif he comes disguised as you say." But the matter was taken up too late, the mis- 'chief was done; that very day he had made a -formal offer of his hand, heart, and fortune; the foolish girl had not accepted, neither had she refused, she had only deliberated. The Colonel -had a sharp talk with Mr. Stapleton the next day -about- his habits, but Tom good-naturedly assured him that Ned was altogether mistaken, he was suf- fering from an attack of vertigo when he met him; but like a sly old --fox, from that day, for many :weeks, he timed his visits to avoid both father and son. Immediately upon this came-what each had anxiously feared-the account of Aleck's fearful illness, .with the daily bulletin from some secret   Uniheeded IVarnings.    33:5 friend, informing the Colonel with great minute- ness of every day's change for better or worse. There was no signature except "A Friend," to all these missives; gradually they grew brghter, more hopeful; and then to Laura-when the suspense which she had shared with the family through the daily letter which was carefully forwarded to her, when this dark night had begun to give way before the dawnings of hope-in that hour came to the stricken wife her own letters returned; those love manuals which she had filled with the penitent overflowings of her heart, had all come back to her unopened. What can be told of her agony in that moment! and she felt that it was for all her life. She was no longer a forgiven, hoping wife, but a wife hated by her husband, dismissed without a word. To Colonel Hartland came, in the post- script of the first letter written by Captain Hart- land's own hand, this sentence, "You will not be surprised that, having become convinced of the infidelity of my wife, I have repudiated her by returning her letters unread, and I wish never to hear her name again. I would also add for your satisfaction, my honored father, that there has never been a word between the Surgeon and my- self in any way relating to Mrs. Hartland." Laura, who had sowed the wind, was reaping the whirlwind; she unbosomed herself to Miss Green- wood, who had proved a judicious and truthful counsellor. She knew that pecuniarily her hus- band would not let her want, but how could she live, and act, and smile, in a world that knew, or would soon know, that she was finally cast off.   She felt that-no, mercy was to be expected from the Colonel's family; already she saw that her con- stant intercourse with Miss Greenwood had led to the withdrawal of Rosine almost entirely from her loved visits to the Navy Yard. Both ladies under- stood the powerful influence of the Doctor, and rightfully laid Rosine's absence at his door; the influence had been exerted, quietly, covertly, per- severingly, and successfully, and though notes of friendship passed between Dora and her young fi-end, they seldom met. At the coming of this stunning blow  to ILaura, she would have gone back at once to her position as a boarder at the House of the Infant Jesus, but neither Sister Agnes nor Miss Greenwood encouraged the step. "No," Dora had said, trying to calm the terrible waves of remorse that swept over Laura, " no; let your hus- band, when he returns, find you where he desired you to be; do every thing as you know he would have you if all were well between you, and I can- not but hope that he will in some way be brought to see his error; if even this should never be, dear Laura; you can take the step you contemplate when you find you can hope no longer." And so the discarded, repudiated wife remained where she was, but she could not conceal from the vorld her aching heart, which left its impress on er whole life. Rosine's was the only dissenting oice when Aleck's decision was made known to le family, she said but very little, she remembered er former failures in this matter, but not a day issed that she did not offer a little prayer, that ,me time the right might be known.   Unheeded Warnings.      337 Between the sisters there had not been quite the freedom of former days, since the quarrel, though Rosine said no more to Marion about Mr. Stapleton, but she thought and wondered and tried not to see, but let every thing pass without observation, not even referring to "cousin Tom" in her letters to her mother; she was glad spring was close at hand, when Marion was to return to Inglewood after a visit to Hawthorndean, and she sometimes wished tine away that the hour might be hastened, and then she accused herself of unsisterly feelings in her desire to be rid of Marion; and on the whole, the winter anticipated with so -much joy, was a time of trial and anxiety to Rosine. But the  crisis was approaching; there came a letter from Mr. Leighton, requiring a reason for her cold. infrequent epistles, and she took the opportunity of the answer to inform him that her feelings had - changed, more knowledge of the world had altered her wishes with respect to life, and she thought the engagement must be considered null. The same declaration, couched in different terms, caused a commotion at Inglewood. It will remembered that thus far they did not there, associate the breach of faith with any second lover. "I ought to send for her home," said Mr. Benton, a little sternly, as he folded the letter. "It is better as it is," replied the wife; "if she have no real love for Horatio, separation is the best thing for both; to send for her would be too strong an effort to bring them together again; you don't suspect any other fancy?"   - "There is no reference to -any in her letter; it is 29   338      lHaWt orndean. to be' hoped She has more heart than such a fact would indicate," replied'the father thoughtfully leaning his head on his hand; "I will write to the Colonel confidentially to-night, and tell him to -act for' her as he would for Rosa." The letter was written and dispatched at once; it crossed a letter from' Colonel Hartland to his friend on the same subject, which we give: "MY DEAR PHILIP:    "    Mareh, 18-. "This is the first time in my life that I am at a -loss for words to write to you, but the truth is, I am -anxious about Marion, and though I know nothing for certainty, Ned thinks there is serious cause why you should know how matters are with your daughter. My cousin, Tom Stapleton, (you will remember him,) returned from the East Indies this autumn, and has been a constant visitor here of course, mine being the only family with whom hle can claim any kindred. He professes to have reformed his early habits, and I did not frown on his visits, for I thought the girls entirely safe, both from extreme difference of age, and Marion by a previous engagement; but the Doctor is of opinion that he is becoming interested in Marion in a way you and I would both seriously regret, and although I cannot think so poorly of her judgment as to believe she would for a moment think of him in comparison with Mr. Leighton; still I thought it right to advise with you respecting this matter We have been of late absorbed in anxiety for Aleck; he is very feeble after his long and terrible     Unheeded Warnings.      339 illness, and will obtain leave of absence as soon as he is able to travel; the poor fellow has more than his share of trouble, and is now smarting under what he says 'damning proofs' of his wife's infi- delity; of course all is at an end between them. The girls are well and happy. The last news from Hawthorndean brought the intelligence of the -very feeble state of Mrs. Hawthorne; the old gentleman has the gloomy prospect of being again left alone; with Willie blind, and himself infirm, this is rather. a dark picture. i"Forgive me, my friend, if I have been incau- tious in allowing Tom here, but really, under the circumstances, I could fear nothing. "As ever, yours faithfully, ALEX.- HARTLAND." ( ,.;, 5/   CHAPTER XXVII. MARRIED   IN HASTE.    ] R. BENTON was seated under the stoop I [! r of the cottage at Inglewood, in the early W &  spring twilight, when he read this letter; - he groaned aloud as he finished it, start- ing Sobriety out of a nap she was comfortably taking in her chair by the kitchen fire. The girl ran to the inner room, where her mistress was quietly penning a letter to her dear absent Harold. "Mr. groaned a heap like a fit!" she said, coldly. "I think you better stir." The wife was by his side instantly, inquiring, "Are you ill, Philip?" placing her hand on his forehead, which bore marks of deep distress. The look from his dark piercing eyes, almost terrified her as he pointed to the letter, placing at the same time his hands over his face, he burst into ant agony of tearless grief, exclaiming, "O, my child, my child! my lost Marion, why did I suffer you to leave me!!" "Is it too late to hope?" inquired :Mrs. Benton after reading the epistle through without pause/ or exclamation; "this tells nothing decidedi.^only 340    Married in Haste.      341 gives reason to fear; it is not too late to warn, cer- tainly." "It is all plain to me, Lucy," he replied, in a voice scarcely audible from strong emotion, which he was in vain endeavoring to control. (Philip Benton was- not as proud and self-contained as of erst.) "Perfidious girl! this accounts for the last: letter from her; how bitter- is to be her punish- ment!" "But is it too late?" again inquired the mother. "God knows," he said; "if Marion with her powerful will has become entangled with this man, she would hardly be influenced by the judgment or advice of a parent. I can use authority-I can separate them-but you, know  well what that means. ' Never before had he referred to their own very early and somewhat imprudent marriage, against the approval of parents, and with at last only a reluctant consent. "The sins of the parents! O, dreadful penance, to see outr dear ones visited in this way." Mrs. Benton was silent; all the long years of their marriage were obliterated, and she remembered only the pleadings of her father as he said, "Lucy, I tremble for your happiness with this proud, haughty man." He had used his authority to prevent the union, till he found time and separation did not change their determination, and then his consent was given under protest. "And yet," said Mrs. Benton to herself, "it was from no real evil that, he knew of Philip, only an unac- countable dislike he had taken to the man." She wondered within herself, as she stood with her hand 29.   34A2    sHawthorndean. resting on her husband's head, that he should have spoken of these things in this connection. He seemed to read her thoughts, and recovering him- self, he drew her down by his side and said affec- tionately, '"Don't for a moment think, Lucy, that I mean to compare our courtship and marriage with Marion's proceedings, if I guess the truth concerning her. , Ours was the first pure generous affection of youth; I only spoke as I did, to show how little parental authority effects in such matters, even -in the most obedient; if Marion intends to put off young Leighton for that scape-grace Staple- ton, it is because of aigilded bait; she is making haste to be rich, like her father, and like him she will blast her whole life." "Do you know him?" inquired the wife; "the Colonel speaks of reformed habits.," "I knew him-well, fifteen years since, as a good- natured fellow about town, fast in many ways; he then spent the income of a large fortune, in drink- ing and carousing. His respectable friends tried to keep him up, and he was never excluded from society, though he was often unfit to appear among ladies.- He lost a part of his fortune by me," he continued, struggling with the memory of those days; "but the Colonel thought -it would be a good thing for him to lose it, and persuaded him to enter into this East India scheme, in which he has been wonderfully successful, and reformed in his habits also; it is time for that; he must be nearly 'las- old as Colonel Hartland. He is fine- loo'kingi -and can be a perfect gentleman, but ahl -he: golden :-hook which. he. holds out. to catch   )Married in Haste.     343 my child! What shall I say to Marion? I have yet to answer her letter announcing a change in her toward Horatio." "I think I should write as if it were impossible she should think of any one else; I tremble for the effect upon Horatio." "Yes, Lucy, he will stagger under it, but I hope he will not fall; we must do what we can for him; many a girl has the ruin of a man, soul and bodv, on her conscience. Leighton will bear it better than some men would-Dr. Nelson, for instance. I think it will harden Horatio, lead him to look on ambition as his bride, and make him thoroughly worldly; you can do much for him, my dear." It was indeed a difficult task to speak to the wounded heart of the young man, when he came to Mrs. Benton with the lines from Marion in his hand, declaring their engagement at an end, and with a restless and unquietable movement, walked the room, begging Mrs. Benton to tell him what to do. She gave him such comfort as she could, would not allow that all hope for him was lost, and the distressed lover returned to his home, spent the night writing letter after letter to his beloved, and ended by tearing all into a thousand pieces. Seizing his portmanteau, into which he had hastily thrust a few articles of clothing, he surprised Mrs. Benton at the first dawn of day, by appearing at Ingle- wood, with the intelligence that he was, en route for the east without delay. Night and day-sleepless nights and wearisome days in those times of slow transportation; but at the end of a week he- found, MA * v   344      Hlawthorndean. himself in a large hotel in the city that contained to him the greatest treasure. He did not once reflect on his appearance-hlls haggard look, his disordered garments-he did not even wait for, fashionable hours, but took his way at once to Colonel Hartland's mansion, with the look of an anxious speculator on his face. He inquired at the door for "Miss Benton;" the servant looked doubt- ful, and then replied that Miss Marion was out, but Miss- Rosine was in-would he send up his name? He had forgotten the existence of such a little thing as a card, but fortunately for his wits, at that moment the Colonel crossed the hall. "Bless my heart!" he exclaimed, coming for- ward and giving his hand cordially to the young man. ",Come in, I am glad to see you; come in here," he added, and remembering all that must necessarily follow this visit, he- opened the door into his own private parlor. It was a very awk- ward position, and no one could feel the awkward- ness more sensibly than the Colonel, and as usual -he made a rush in imedias res at once. "I suppose you came, principally to look after- Marion,?' he said after a pause that was terrible to both. "I hope you may be in time to make matters all straight again; she has gone to ride just now with-my cousin, Tom Stapleton; these constant attentions troubled me, but you know I felt she was safe." The hot blood mounted to the temples of the young man as he heard this, there was more to'be feared than he had thought; he had not believed that Marion could already put another in his place.   3I/arried in Haste.     345 At that moment he heard her ringing voice in the lall, and the tones of her attendant as he followed closely upo" her     said the Colonel, "or s Willyou see her here   said  Colonel, o will you go to the library." will you go        be he said very "I will meet them together," he said ver  y angrily: "I will-know in his presence the result of my  coming." The Colonel stepped across the hall and ushered him into the room unannounced   . Here was a rencontre indeed. Stapleton, the thorough, good- natured man of the world, with his nonchalant air, his courteous manners, and (I must say it, shocking as it is, it is the truth,) his rechercha dress, perfect even to the very tips of his boots, had a decided advantage over the plain, straightforward, some- what diffident manner of our western hero. Mar- ion gave a little scream of suprise as he entered, but she was not abashed, for she had neither the stern eye of her father, nor the cold, cynical sneer of the Doctor to meet; she expressed her wonder very naturally, and eagerly inquired if there was any trouble at Inglewood, that was the cause of his unexpected presence. Let not my readers suppose that Marion was entirely heartless, she was only weak and vain. It w\ould have been impossible for her then to have loved any man Simply for himself; over her soul, capable of great things but for this shadow, had grown the upas of ambition tobe rich, to have posi- tion: the roots were imbedded in her very nature, and they had grownt with her growth, in spite of the -careful weeding of a mother's hand; nothing but careful W^   346      /Hwthornidean. the spade of affliction, sorrow, mortification, digging down deep into her soul, could tear out and root up this deadly plant that fed on the "right choice food" of her affections. As Leighton plead with her that night, opening before her the rich trea- sures of his love, and telling her what he would do for her, and- of his high hopes for her sake; of political advancement, Congress, the Cabinet, even the White House, passed in review before her, but these were only possibilities: while Mr. Stapleton, as he had told her often, was ready to make her at once mistress of as fine an establishment as the city could furnish, with every thing money could buy, and a- voyage to Europe as a wedding tour; these were tangible certainties. Let us hope it was the tour of Europe, and not the filthy lucre decided her.' Leighton was seen no more at Colonel Hart- land's, and' in less than two weeks she allowed her new lover to inform the Colonel that they only waited the consent of her father to their betrothal. The consent -was not given, neither was it withheld. Mr. Benton warned his daughter of the possible consequences of her folly, in words that made her tremble and weep over the beautiful set of dia- monds her lover had that day brought her. He did not order her to come home, he laid no com- mands upon her as she feared, but he did not give her his blessing, or wish her happiness; he simply said, "My daughter, if you have deliberately chosen this lot--God help you!" Marion's energy and determination came ttiher assistance, she did not give way to grief, she rode rough-shod over her own better nature, to the ru                  to Ahe.   /arried in Haste.      347 accomplishm ent of her ambition. Mr. Stapleton was impatient; why should a man of fifty years defe r is marriage? M atters were perhaps has- tened by areport which Dr. Hartland mischievously brought home, that a former flame of cousin TomIs had just arrived in town, in the person of a rich and charming widow. It may be said to Marion's credit perhaps, that although her external manner was bright and gay as ever, she could not go through the' preparation the Catholic Church re- quires even of her neligent children for the recep- tion of the sacrament'of marriage, without much interior suffering and many misgivings. She did not care to meet Fatherh Roberts, but a stranger, might be found to perform  the marriage cere- It  was the losing eve of the month of lMay, the day before the wedding; a tender letter from her mother was in wher hand, couched in those 'terms which only a mother can use. Marion had asked to be allowed to- return -home with her husband before their foreign tour, and it had been Mrs. Benton's hard task to say, that for thepresent she must spare them, the wound was too recent. It would be small satisfaction to either herself or her parents to come to them now; and then in the close there were so many affectionate heart- yearnings for her wandering child, that even Marion wavered, asking herself almost with anguish, if it were best thus to grieve and wound those who loved her so dearly. It was dusk of a moonlight eve, the lamps were not lighted, and there wasgreat quiet in the room,   43.48     L awthorndean.  a silence almost ominous; no one observed the terrible anguish that crossed her brow as she sat gazing into the street, wholly unconscious of what was passing without, until she saw her lover alight from' his, carriage, and run up the steps. The splendid span of mottled bay horses pranced and champed the bit with impatience; he had come for a last drive, together before leaving the country. Just for one instant she wished the horses, car- riage, servant, footman: in livery, and the master" of the establishment with Pharaoh's lost chariots; the next she was arraying herself for the drive, scattering all her better- thoughts to the wind. The marriage was very quiet; the ceremony at the church, the leave-taking, and the drive to the steamer which was to carry them to the, Old ,World. Rosine could not restrain her-sobs as the last roll of the carriage resounded through the hall; she rushed to her own room, and threw her- self upon a couch, exclaiming in the bitterness of her grief, "O, if I could but wake and find this only a horrid dream! But my poor father and mother! I ought, yes, I really ought to go to them at once." She dried her eyes, and with something of Marion's energy and determination went to the library. Dr. Hartland was alone, look- ing very savage. "Ned," she said, entreatingly, "do0 help me.- I ought to go to my parents; think of their grief and loneliness,-five children, and. not one left.: to them. O, do -help me, dear brother, to do what is right; will you- ask the Colonel?" "Ask him to please to send you off?" inquired   iMarrized zn Haste.     349 the Doctor. "Well, I suppose I can live without you  , Rosa; I have done it, but the Colonel and mother, I don't know--." "But, Ned," she pleaded, "this will kill my dear parents; such a grief will wear them into the grave. I must go, I must go!" and she fairly broke down again. "Either you shall be resLored to them, or they shall come to you, my dear child,"' he said, sooth-  ingly ;" it is but right you should be restored to them, desolate as your going would leave this house. It has been one of the best blessings to us all that you came," he added, risingand rushing to the window, as if something unusual was pass- ing in the street--"something shall be done," he continued, " only let me see you smile as you used to do. This affair of Marion's has aged you as well as herself; positively, she looked twenty-five when she left the house." "Yes, it has weighed me to the earth, replied Rosine; "but O, if I could only believe that she is not already wretched! to think too, that she could have gone so far without even one word to such friends as Father Roberts and Sister Agnes." "By-the-way, Rosine," replied the Doctor, "I saw Father Roberts in the street yesterday, he has received a late letter from Harry; it seems the young man has fine offers to remain where he is, and like a dutiful Catholic, probably wished his good confessor's opinion; 1 gave mine pretty strongly off-hand. The priest agreed with me, that we have not so many such souls in this country, that we can afford to lose one." 30   -350     . aawltomrndean. "TPerhaps Marion, may meet himn abroad," said Ros^ie, looking up'quite like'herself. -r "araly^ replied the Doctor; "butterflies and bIeest rarely mingle." They were interrupted-in their conversation by Colonel Hartland, who came hurrying in, agitation visible in every motion, with a letter in his hand. Good news for us all!" he cried. "Aleck will be home before many days, he sailed the middle of :-M yi." ' -    ,  - Eageriy they noted each day as it went by, and -:whe' at- last anxiety had begun to take the place of hope, he did :come, but so changed! Nothing remained Of the former cheerful, happy, almost boyish fiace of Aleck; nothing but the tender blue -eye and its drooping lid; a fixed sternness had settled about the mouth, and deep wrinkles were 'imbedded in the thin sallow cheeks; the' bright" brown locks were shorn of their lustre, and silver tfreards -were scattered about the temples. 'He looked older than his brother. Here was a mis- sion for Rosine, a sister's mission, to bring back to the s-carred heart of the brother, trust and faith. Diligently she worked at this task through that long s'iiummer, waiting for her own restoration to her parents quietly and hopefully, and in the mean time- working constantly at that work which the good God had placed directly in her pathway. IThe re was no word of Laura from the lips of her hisband through all that long time, not even in hfie[ abt6andonment of a visit to her grandfather, hc lCn: osi-ne made 'in company 'with Captain iartland, the "'Doctor hoping that, the mountain   arried z  Haste. .35i air of that region might restore his exhausted powers. Twice since his return, Laura hatd es- sayed to go to him, but had fainted in the prepara- tion; she had also written two notes, which. had been returned to her unopened. Dora could not help her, for the Commodore had been stricken by disease, and was more exacting than ever, not suffering his daughter out of his sight. At length Laura ventured her last effort, she wrote to the Colonel an imploring note, begging him to; use his influence to gain for her only one interview; it was an humble, beseeching letter, and Colonel Hartland's heart was softened; he called Aleck to his private room, and gave him the note. The young man only glanced at the first sentence and :threw it from  him. "Base woman!" he ex- claimed, "if she torments me thus, I will take legal measures to be rid of her; if she would lepve me alone, I would be content to remain as I am, to save her from shame. Why should I care for her shame?"' he added, grinding his teeth. ,' She gave little heed to it when she gave herself to dishonor-to infamy." "Then you have no doubt of her criminality?" inquired Colonel Hartland. "There, sir, is our wedding-ring," he replied, with unmitigated scorn in his voice, drawing the bright -circle from his finger--" our wedding ring! given over to the villain to whom she' had given herself!- Infamous! Do you think I wIsh to bandy words with her?" he said, striding across the floor in his wrath. Colonel Hartland' said no more. *     'G11    -       o " "-T' - CHAPTER XXVIII. "'- .- '? r":'EASTWARD, HO! ;. "H;UGH he had not forgotten his pro- E .i;?milse, Dr. Hartland had not confided to fsine his plans for her, lest-there should -: ;. .,.be some failure. Her grandfather, by the loss of his second wife, was left with only the com- panionship an comfort of the little blind boy who had been, committed to him as a precious loan; aod the, Doctor designed, if it were possible, to bring back Mrs. Benton and her exiled husband to the, home of her youth, for the sake of Rosine, who,  could then spend a part of each year in her two homes; as to permitting her to join them in Inglewood, he had- not for a moment harbored the idea. This removal was a pet plan and proposal of Ned'sand he had even gone so far as to sound Mr. Hawthorne himself as to the feasibility of the plan, w hen he had gone- to Hawthorndean with Rosine to attend the funeral of the wife. It was a mere suggestion- on his part; the old gentleman had receiYed it at first as an impossibility; neither fhe I ;rr' Philip Benton could endure a meeting, fioh ieseachs-other's hconstant presence; but Dr.- Harland saw that the thought was fixed, and the 352   Eastward,-Ho!       353 delight of the grandfather over Rosine's presence, gave him great hope. After his return to-the city he made known the proposition to his father, with strict injunctions of secrecy, lest false hopes might be raised in his daughter's mind. The Colonel was,: of course, highly delighted; he had been suffering since his son had told him that Rosine was yearn- ing for her parents, and any suggestion that pre- vented a separation from her he hailed- with- joy, and proposed at once to write to his friend Benton, well knowing that coming from him it would have more influence than from any other source, The letter was written after an interview with Mrs. Benton's father, in which the Colonel des- canted at large on the great change there was in his friend Philip, the entire disappearance of the hauteur and pride that had marked his early days. Mr. Hawthorne was moved by the Colonel's argu- ments; the prospect of his dear daughter's presence by his lonely hearthstone enabled him, after a little struggle, to say to the Colonel that he would receive them both with a hearty welcome. Equipped with this invitation, Colonel Hartland felt as if he was invincible, and forthwith the fol- lowing letter was dispatched from Hawthorndean, addressed to Mrs. Benton. I IAWTHORNDEAN, October, 18-. 4 MY DEAR LUCY':. "I am in your old home, and I write to you'at- this time, instead of Philip, for I am reminded more forcibly of you than of him in this fine old country mansion. Ned gave me so 4bad an account of 'your' 30*   354      ]Hawthorndean. father's loneliness, that I ran up to see what I could do for, him., I found him much prostrated with grief and very lonely, and I am authorized from -him to; give to you and Philip a hearty welcome back to your old home; he will receive you both withopen arms and a father's blessing. Tell Philip for me, that I know all he will say, but nothing ought toprevent the restoration of his wife to her father, and the sooner it is accomplished the better; it would also give you back Willie, and bring you near our beloved Rosine, who has won all our hearts, and grows more lovely each day. "Let Philip consider it well. I know there will be trials in this step; will there not be also coun- ter-balancing pleasures?'not the least of which I flatter myself is the occasional glimpse you will get of your old tried' friend, ALEX. HARTLAND." It is perhaps unnecessary to say, that Mrs. Ben- ton's heart throbbed violently when she read this letter, awaking once more to a hope that had well nigh died out of her patient soul. Her husband noticed the superscription, and said, with a quiet smile of satisfaction, "Ahi, Lucy, the Colonel finds me but a   poor correspondent, and turns to you." Often in the solitude of her own room she had shed many tears for her dear parent, left in his advanced age without child or companion; now there were no tears, but the letter frightened her by the excess of joy that leapt up from her heart, as shethought of going back to the dear old home. She did not give the letter to Mr. Benton- until she   East ward, Ho!      3 5- saw an anxious look gathering on his face; he had observed by the variations of her countenance-that it contained intelligence of importance, and as she looked at him without speaking, still-holding the letter, he put out his hand, and took, it. She watched the shadows gather on his brow-as he read, and settle into a decided frown as he folded - the letter, and went out of her presence without a word. She felt that her hope- must give way to disappointment--that what she wished could never be-and with one struggle she gave up the wish, determined that her life should still be one con- tinual sacrifice. Weeks passed, and 'the subject was not named between them; indeed, her hus- band seemed to withdraw himself from her, as if she had been in some way a party to his dishonor. At length, when the time grew long, and the letter remained unanswered; when she had made up her mind to say to the Colonel that, pleasant and dear as the proposition was to her heart, it was impos- sible-that day he came to her in the quiet autumn twilight. She knew from whence he came when she saw him ride into the yard; it was the eve of All-Saints, and he had been to the new grave of his little Jeannie in consecrated ground, and to the 'study of his pastor. "Lucy," he said, as he entered the little inner-room which was her sanc- tum, "I have come to tell you-we will go." The voice, the manner, every- thing, was so strange that Mrs. Benton arose hastily, and went- to him. "Yes, I am ready to go," he added, allowing her to lead him to a seat; "the agony of bringing my proud heart to be willing is over, and-r."   356--     fawithorndeazn. "But, Phii pmy dear husband, why should you wput sch fore upon yourself?" her voice trembled with he- effort to speak without emotion. "We are: not- obliged to go; we have a pleasant, happy home .herev you and H,"  She hesitated she could not advance with truth; her heart did long [her father and children.  '"Yesi Lucy, we are very happy here," he replied; "more of earthly happiness than I ought ever to have thought could last. I will say that it has been ahnost like a death-struggle to-think of giving it" up, but I have done it. Father Sheridan has helped me," he added; " without him I do not think Hcould ever have brought myself to the step, even- for your sake, but lie says it is plainly God's wi. I have laid the whole matter before him from the beginning, like a map, and he has not decided ithoutdeep thought and earnest prayer O, Lucy, can earthl afford any comfort like the help probed the matter to :the very foundation, and thise i   s hPs decision."        -hi "And   this all for me, Philip?" said the wife overcone with the thought of the terrible sacrifice he was making.        t   - "Not altogether, dear," he replied; " let us hope it is:to be the final blow to my terrible pride, hich -we can never be sure is conquered, ti l itcanWbear t hmeet thos e whom I have wronged.{ i ", Phiip, " she exclaimed clasping. hiseand "n hers, it would be so blessed to die among  Which -we can n, ever - be - surd is co   EZaslward, Ho!      357 own!", He did not reply; he could not meet the matter as yet, with any desire,/it was a too fearful rending of the veil that hid him from the world. With the energy and determination of his char- acter, he saw that the longer the matter was deferred the harder would be the end, and like a true man he went to work at once on the neces- sary preparations for their removal before -the winter. There were trials in parting, -even to Mrs.-Benton; the home which they had made in the-wilderness had many dear and precious associations, but par- ticularly her regard for Dr. Nelson and the Leigh- ton family, with more than all, her affection for Father Sheridan, who had been such a heaven-sent friend, made her leaving Inglewood, even with the prospect of a home at Hawthorndean, a great trial; but Dr. Nelson had been led to aspirations for the priesthood, and was soon to make his pre- parations for the holy work at a Seminary of the Sulpicians; she had helped him in finding his vocation, and their friendship was cemented by the most enduring tie. She had been obliged to consent very reluct- antly to Sobriety's marriage; finding her deter- mined, she had promised her an outfit if she would wait till after the Christmas holidays, wlhen she would be sixteen; all this, however, could be arranged with Mrs. Leighton, who would take a motherly care of the girl for the sake of her friend, for Marion's faithless course had made no enmity between the two families. Horatio Leighton never cared to see Athlacca again, and in the spring   was to remove h.-is mother's residence to thie capital of the state, which for the future was to be his :home; Dr. Nelson's sister, Philomena, had been his little housekeeper for some months, though scarcely in her teens, and Mrs. Benton's proposi- tion to take her east for her education was most gladly accepted by the: brother. As the day ap- proached When Mr. and Mrs. Benton were to take leave of Inglewood, the faithful "Old Cap" seemed all at once to become ubiquitous. Through the days of their preparation, Mrs. Benton met him everywhere, always with his mouth filled with tobacco, and his hand ready to help. "W 'aal, I vow," he exclaimed, as he saw the row of boxes packed and marked, "this beats the Dutch; taking track for the east--heaps of truck to haul, let's see--one, two, three, four. I can't count a hundred, but I've got a brother as can; deary me," he said, looking at Mrs. Benton, "what mischief these gals make! I'll be bound this movin has to do with that right pretty gal." Mrs. Benton assured him that Miss Marion had nothing whatever to do with their departure. He shook his head doubtingly. "Waal, she's clearin )ut .'Athlacca any way-here's Leighton. can't dtand 'it;, and mothers natrally foller thar sons; hen she's spilte the Doctor for all useful doins; nd so they'll smake a priest on him; and finally ter-poor pap and mam  must pull up stakes and ller; waal, women do make a tarnal site of bother. low:here's my Lindy Ann's been down  to Crow ik to hear -this seventh-day feller; her auntsent rAher to cuem and get religion; she staid ni a i     '         '  ' i   Eastward, Ho!      359 week, -and came homes crank and piert enough I tell yer-said she'd got religion, but I don't-see it; talks like a spinnon-wheel about the Pope and Nanteclarist, sent all the Papists to the bad place you know. Then, I put in, and tel'd her she'd full better tuk the chance of sum of them Papists than of Jim McKinsey, or any other seventh dayer. They-used to have them fellers in York state; they kept my woman and all her sisters in a tarnal brile all the time. I thought we'd got clear of the whole scrape on um when we came here; deary me, if that's what they call the march of civilizashun, the less on't the better." The poor man having relieved himself, stuffed a new quid into his mouth and went to work. Mrs. Benton talked to him of the expected tenant at Inglewood, but Rice declared he never wished to know him, for the truth was, he no sooner made friends with one new-comer -before he was gone, and another took his place. Rosine was almost wild with delight when she heard of the removal of her parents; her joy seemed like the overflowing of waters long pent in by restraint; apparently she forgot Marion and her misdemeanor; took but little interest, Ned declared, in any letters from abroad, and was absorbed in the one thought that she was again to be near her mother, laying plans without number with Aleck and the Doctor, all associated with dear Hawthorn- dean. As to Aleck, Rosine's plans were the only matters into which he entered with any interest; his health was utterly broken down, his wound refused to heal,.and mental anxiety was sapping   the very foundations of his life; through his lawyer he had settled- an annuity upon his wife, which could be withdrawn at his pleasure, but his heart was evidently ill at ease. Laura had again found refuge-with Sister Agnes in the new House, that, Phoenix like, had risen on the ashes of the older establishment. The Captain heard of her removal frommhis mother, but he made no sign;'the time was coming, he plainly foresaw, when he should be obliged' to resign on half-pay; perhaps something might be given him by government, in considera- tion of his wound received in fighting his country's battles. In his father's house he had always a home, but his life, ere he had reached thirty years, -was growing, w"some to him. He clung to Rosine for comfort, as did every member of the fanily, and he was delegated to accompany her to Hawthorndean, to greet her parents on their arrival there. It had been a matter of a little con tention in the Colonel's household, which of the three representatives of the male sex should have his honor, but a patient on the borders of the grave settled-the question with Dr. Hartlald, and government business pressed upon the Colonel; bus, much to the discomfort of the two left behind, the Captain was the escort. It was beautiful to behold the tenderness that had sprung up between these two; a-deferential, respectful, gentle affection on his part, and a thoughtful care-taking love with her. She was the only one upon whom he ever smiled with one of those sunny, bright smiles, out of his clear blue eye, that had given him such attrac- tion- his early youth; now those heart-glimpses   lEastwara, 1O!      30 1 were very rare, and given in return for her loving assiduityt for his comfort. "Perchance he saw and felt the sympathy She had for him, whose soul had such a scar." They reached Hawthorndean to find the grand- father prostrate with the infirmities of age, and as Rosine soon discovered, borne down with anxiety about the coming meeting. With womanly tact, and the soft lady-like ways of her mother, she did much to smooth the path for the reception of her father. The hour came at length when Philip Benton and his wife had left the railroad station, and wer- on their way across the bleak and bare November hills of her native town. Ah, those dear old stone walls, those precious home enclosures, strangers in the land where she had dwelt, they came to her like long lost treasures, and filled her with un- spoken joy. Her husband could not sympathize with her here; she knew-that to him this hour was one of untold sorrow, and she hid her joy, as the shade grew deeper on his brow at every familiar object. He nearly br6ke down as they came sud- denly upon the entrance to a. quiet, grassy lane, ending in a dense wood, where many years ago he had breathed into her ear words of love. She did not trust herself to speak, to calm his agita- tion, but quietly let her hand slip into his, re- assuring him and strengthening him by her touch. Never till that evening had Rosine felt her father's tears on her cheek, never had he so clasped her to his heart, and looked down into her eyes 31   - vr ' t' 'w-rAS, with such -inexpressible emotion. Mr. Hawthorne was unable to rise even to meet his beloved daugh- ter, and Philip Benton, who had nerved himself for this moment, waited only to embrace his chil- dren, when he sunk on his knees by the couch of the old man, exclaiming, "I have wronged you sir, deeply wonged you, by the past; can you forgive me for Lucy's sake?" "Rise, my son," replied the trembling voice of the father; "I judged you harshy--come back to me, come as a favor, and establish yourself as the head of my house. Lucy and-you are all I hlave; my days can be but few, let me spend them with my children., Mrs. Benton listened, and tears of gratitude bedewed her cheeks, for this dreaded scene ending in unity and peace.    a     e Mrs. Benton was soon as thoroughly domesti- cated as if she had never left her hoine, and her husband, without intruding in any way, gradually came to be the acknowledged master of the estab- lishment; while Rosine and Aleck lingered among those beloved hills long after their tops were covered with white snow-wreaths. The blind Wil- he had taken a sudden fancy to Captain Hartland, and was his companion night and day. He had procured for him an alphabet and books for the blind, and assiduously set himself to teach the child to read; he also roamed over the fields with him, told him tales of war, and life in various countries; in short, made himself so necessary to the boy, that eword about returning to the city grieved him to the heart. Letter after letter had come from the    tasward, Ho!.      - 363  Colonel and the Doctor, urging their return, and threatening on the Doctor's part an immediate raid upon the premises if Rosine was not forthcoming. It was a hard wrench upon the maternal love of Mrs. Benton to part with her daughter again; she had hoped that immediate arrangements would be made for Rosine's final restoration to her own family; but here she found her husband invincible. His word had passed to Colonel Hartland, and he could not and would not recall what was given when in the depths of adversity, now that what the world would call more prosperous days were in store for them. There had been very little said of Marion during Rosine's sojourn at Hawthorndean, except in the quiet of her mother's chamber; there they had mingled their griefs for the daughter and sister so loved, and it seemed so lost. The Doctor was as good as his word; when many weeks went by, and still Rosine and Aleck did not arrive, he suddenly started in pursuit of the wanderers. Mr. Benton was a little startled by the warm greeting of Rosine and the Doctor, and the tight hold he kept of his prize all the evening, and his persistent determination to see Sunny Nook with Rosine in winter dress; but his wife reassured him, for into her loving ear the confiding daughter had poured all -her griefs, not the least of which was the dis- tress Marion's suggestions with respect to Dr. Hartland had caused her. Edward Hartland looked anxious and careworn, he seemed to forget, after: the first moment, his: light-hearted converse, and to have become reti- cent to every one but Rosine. In: the morning   364-      tawthorndean. came the ramble through Paradise, which- he had promised himself. There was but little depth of snow on the ground, and in Sunny Nook the warm sunlight had melted the little that had fallen; the clematis and grape-vine were stripped and bare, the tall elms leafless, but among the dense growth of pine and hemlock the blue-jay and snow-bird found a warm covert, and- a retreat even in the severest storms. When they found themselves alone in the shelter, the Doctor drew the thick wrapper closer around Rosine, and said, "There, Rosita, I have you alone at last; I could not tell you what I have to tell, in any place but this. I have missed you so much-I have done a miserable foolish thing since you left town-but I must tell you." "What is it-?" she inquired, struck by the dis- tress in his voice, which he in vain tried to make playful. "The Commodore is dead, and I have been to see Dora." Rosine did: not speak; she knew the spirit with which she had to deal too well to trust any words; she felt that all was over forever between him and Dora, that he had:again sought her love and been refused. "Dear Ned,"- was all she could say, sorrow: and tenderness mingling in her tones. "Yes, Rosine, she called me that, and more; she assured me that she loved me better than any earthly thing, ^but that there was a barrier between us-you -know-what it is, Rosa. I do not blame her, she has shown me her whole heart, she has hid- nothing from me of all those long years,   Eastward, Ho!       365 her scorching, scathing trials. Rosine, she has been a martyr all her days, and now when I would shelter her in these arms, she will not take the happiness offered to her; she seeks entire martyr- dom in the religious life, as a Sister of Charity; she begged me not to think of her except as one dead to the world, but I vowed on my knees, that till she had taken her last vows, I should still hope. She begged and plead with me to forget her, as if that were possible. I left her almost crazed, in her distress with my vehemence, and I shall never see her again. I am alone in the world, a poor shattered bark; mine has stranded on higher rocks than Aleck's, but I doubt if his is a more complete wreck." He rested his head on her shoulder, and she felt his strong frame shiver and shake under the struggle. Rosine wanted to speak, to tell him how wounded her own heart was for him, but tears told that better than words. It was not in Dr. Hartland's nature to display his utter hopelessness even to Rosine, and before many minutes he recovered his usual self-possession. "Shall I never see Dora again?" inquired his companion. "Not as Miss Greenwood; she leaves this week for Emmetsburg. She gave me this," he added, drawing from his bosom the locket Rosine remem- bered so well, "entreating me to remember her brothers, and forget her." For some moments the two looked at these beloved faces in silence, till he spoke in a husky voice: "Dear Earnest, you were made of 'that precious 21-    porcelain of human clay that breaks with the first fall, but .-through' years the inner weight must bear.' I suppose there was nothing, indeed she told me there- was nothing, so hard to part with as tki, but she is going where ' the world forgetting by the world forgot, she is to have nothing of her own, to be a servant, a slave!" He spoke bitterly. Don t be bitter against her, Ned," pleaded Rosine, laying her hand on his'arm; "she is cer- tainly suffering, perhaps even more than you, but she is called, she thinks, to a higher life; a life that, if you put yourself out of the question, you can certainly look at with comfort. Think of the good she will do, of the prayers she will offer for you; think of Sister Agnes; her self-denying life, the care and protection she is giving to so many. Ah, Ned, is it right to wish our friends to belong to us, instead of God?" lThe Doctor did not reply; his heart was too sore to argue, and he loved Rosine too well to wish, if he could, to shake the slightest outpost of her faith.           CHAPTER XXIX. REPENTANCE AT. LEISURE. EDWARD HARTLAND remained only two days at Hawthorndean. Rosine no longer hesitated to return with him; she felt that his old grief, so newly revived, needed the comfort of her presence, he had told her so. Dr. Hartland added his advice to the urgent persuasion of Mrs. Benton, and the plead- ings of Willie, that Captain Hartland should remain in the country; Rosine too, hoped he could make himself contented at Hawthorndean for awhile, for Ned had told her that it would never do for him to go back to his aimless life in the city; there- fore she helped Willie's pleas and her parents' argu- ments, though she would miss Aleck so much. On getting back to the city, they found three letters waiting, one for Dr. Hartland from Harry Green- wood, and one from Marion for Rosine, by the same steamer, besides a package, and farewell note from Dora. The Doctor insisted upon reading his aloud, before she broke the seal of hers.  "There was never any thing in Harry's letters," he'said, "which she might notl hear," but before he had finished the second page, he stammered and paused, 367 -^   368 -      awthorndean. and was at length obliged to say: "Well, Rosine, I am mistaken this time,. must not read you all of his;" he had -blundered upon something quite serious with regard to Marion and her husband, and which Harry particularly requested him not to speak of. They had met abroad, " the bee and the butterfly," in the French metropolis. Marion had soon made herself known to Mr. Greenwood, they were at the same hotel. A few weeks had passed in very pleasant social intercourse, the young man being delighted to meet one who had come so lately from those best loved. Business occupied all his days, but- his evenings were mostly given to his new friends and their gay circle. He had already made the discovery that life for the bride so young, so beautiful, so sprightly, and fond of pleasure, could be a prospect of nothing but wretchedness. She seemed light hearted and happy with the world, but he had twice brought her husband to her, after an absence of three days, in a state which required weeks of constant nursing to make him presentable; and he knew there must be a sad heart-ache under that veil of cheer- fulness; "there was a feeling of indignation against such a sacrifice," he added, "through the circle in which they moved." Young Greenwood wrote with the ardor and enthusiasm of a soldier, about his wish to protect this lovely young creature from such a brute. Dr. Hartland stamped his foot and bent his brow as he read this, and straightway took himself to the library to answer the letter without delay, not waiting to see what Marion would say for   Repentance at Leisure.    369 herself, in her letter to her sister. She told of her delightful life in Paris, of her meeting, with Mr. Greenwood, and of her talks with him about home friends, and the flattering remarks he was pleased to make of one of her near relatives; of his kindness and attention to herself, which she attributed solely to his regard for her sister; she did not once mention her husband, and the , quick- sighted reader discovered a vein of effort through the letter, a concealed something, that increased Rosine's forebodings of ill; this troubled her so much, that 'she forgot for a long while Dora's note; this calmed her, gaveher a look beyond and above this life to that haven of rest, for which even te 'youngest and happiest,: if thoughtful withal, are not without longings.  "NAVY YARD, January, 18-. " It is' better that we do not meet a at thiS time, my dear Rosa; I know you willnot doubt my love in leaving thus without a last kiss, Mychild, it is of iron, and now I wish to shun all that can remind me of the past; you will forgive me--weshall meet again. I go to offer to my dear Lord 'the remnant of my days. Of- those I leave, there are two that H specially commend . to, your prayers and to your love; I need not tell-you who they are. I send you my much-loved crucifix; ,it is the last earthly treasurefron which it is hard to part. Commending you, my, beloved, to the prayers of our Blessed MOther, I am ever yours in the dear fth    .  DORA GREENWOOD. fal-th         "   370      H]awthorndean. Dr. Hartland's reply to the letter of Mr. Green- wood was sharp and caustic. Dora had said to him, in that last dreadful interview, "' You will love Harry still, and counsel him;" and now he thought only of this request. For Marion he had no pity; he misjudged her in his bitterness, and he warned his friend of, her arts, related to him the story of her marriage, her faithlessness to early vows; berated Stapleton to his heart's content, but still blamed the wife through all; cautioning Harry to be on his guard; not to consider himself fire-proof, but to remember that older and wiser heads than his had succubed to a pretty woman; assured him that there was no more dangerous confidant for a young, enthusiastic fellow like himself, than an interesting woman who lived unhappily with her husband. Mr. Greenwood was very indignant when he read this letter, he felt the injustice toward Mrs. Stapleton, was very angry with Ned for accusing her of art; indeed, but for the good common sense and fidelity to truth, which were strong points of his character, the letter of the Doctor would have had an opposite effect to that which he intended. He threw it from him in great displeasure, but the closing sentence drew his heart back to his right honest friend, when he said, "I counsel you, as a man older and more experienced than yourself, but I counsel you for love, Harry, the love I bear the dead as well as the living, to whom I   havepromised, under all circumstances, to be your friend." A  Second reading of the letter calmed him, he tried to look at the matter from Ned's stand-point; the third reading, which he   Repenltance at Leisure.    371 resolutely made, brought him to his right mind, and caused him to own to the monitor who kept constant watch over the citadel of his heart, that the warning was not without its purpose. Only the previous evening Marion had sought his pro- tection from the face of her husband, who was raving under the influence of the fatal cup, and he had helped her, pitied her; and shielded her, and in return she had overwhelmed him with thanks, and confided to him a portion of her terrible trial; and the censorious world of Paris, though he knew it not-especially the American portion of it- were already making their comments. It seemed unmanly, almost ungenerous, to leave a woman in this unprotected position, so abruptly, too; but' fortunately for his purpose, he received a second and urgent call to Rouen, which he had once refused, why, he could not well say; he would reconsider, he would at any rate do right. His determination was strengthened when Mrs. Staple- ton sent for him again that evening, her husband still brutalized and violent. During that interview he told her of the necessity of his departure on account of his business, which would call him home in a few months, and he had already lin- gered in the capital longer than he at first intended. She clung to him with tearful eyes and throbbing heart, and in utter dismay begged him to tell her what to do. Dr. Hartland was in -error about her using her arts to fascinate Mr. Greenwood; what- ever her faults, she had not sunk to that. She had a conscience which, though it had not hindered her from wronging her lover, was quite too active   372      .Hawtiorndean. 6 yet to admit a' thouglt unworthy of her as a -wife. The atmosphere of the life she was leading, the society in which she now mingled, might in time- break down even these barriers; but she was too freshy from her mother's hand to look upon posi- tive vice with any thing but horror. She desired a protector, she was afraid of her husband, and left to the mercy of hirelings in a foreign land, it was most natural she should look for help to one who had known and loved her friends at home; but the very call for protection made the position of protector a dangerous one, and the warning was not in vain. When she inquired of him so earnestly what she should do without his help, Mr. Greenwood suggested that she should take the first sober, reasonable moment of her hus- band to urge a  return to her own country; there she would be among friends, and he might be restrained by their presence. It was in the midst of the festive scenes of the gayest of cities that a kind Providence brought to Marion's heart the truth that she had left her father's house, where there was plenty, and filled hlerself with husks. She- found her slight hold upon the man with whom she had vowed to jour- ney through life already loosening.  Her youth and fresh loveliness, her vivacity and ready wit, had charmed him for awhile, but his nature was too entirely sensual to be held long by any tie and she awoke from her short dream of wealth and ambition, to find that the apples of Sodom are bitter. She saw her influence waning with her,   Repentance at Leisure.    373 'husband even in his sober hours; he was always then a gentleman, but she could see that her wishes were not all that they had been to him in the early days of their marriage. Their tour was not half completed, and she had often declared her willingness to live abroad; but now, after the advice of Mr. Greenwood, she set herself to persuade Mr. Stapleton to an immediate return to their native  land. She had never before suffered; the long, lonely nights of watching were new to her; the fearful scenes of that chamber of drunkenness were a terrible opening of the bottomless pit to her terri- fied soul: and she stood alone, yes, alone in the world:; upon her own indomitable will rested the responsibility of her position; she had, as Ned had twice told her, " made her own bed, and on it she must lie!"Hardihood and firmness were natural to her, but now she was filled with quaking fear, whefn she heard the shuddering screams of her husband resisting the devils that haunted him. Such were her days and nights, while she watched and waited, feeding him, by the advice of the phy- sician, with the fire that was consuming his life- blood; still fostering hope that if she could but bring him back to friends, all this would be changed; but when the paroxysm wore off, and she ventured her proposition, he received it with good-natured indifference, and patting her on the cheek, said he had not shown her half of Europe; he couldn't think of bringing her home yet. Poor, lone heart! she had gained the object of her ambi- tion, riches without stint, the capacity to make a 32   ^- ,  ,  * -* ^' mwrnaeait, Show to any extent, every thing that money could :buy, foliowers, but no friends. That was a winter f unmitigated disappointn and mortification; her own quiet home at Inglewood and the earnest love :oft eigliton were already objects. of bitter regre!t; and yet she wore the hollow smile when her;husband was in a condition to enter society with her, and was courted and admired in a way that once would have flattered her. There were horrible moments, when she almost resolved to cast from-her the fear of God and man,-and take the intoxicating pleasures held out to her as the best the world, had left, and sink into a vortex of dissipation, drowning thought, and conscience and hope in the whirlpool around her; but the prayers she had learned at her mother's knee she :had not forgotten, and her guardian angel still bent over her in love; and in time the good God sent her hope from another source, and tile fountain of true womanhood was opened in her heart. The last bell had rung, and the appointed man was preparing to remove the plank from the side of the Great Western, which lay at the- wharf at Liverpool, when a young man came running down the quay, giving a leap from the wharf to the ship's side. "You[ came plaguy nigh being left, my young chap, said a-man in coarse cloth, with his hands deep bured ;in his nether garments, and his lank, co0rse hair hanging over his shoulders;"that's a poor lookout for a smart piece like- you:; itill              .:   Repentance at Leisure.    375 do for'us steerage folcs, but the like o'you ought to have plenty of time." 'Yes, it was a risk," replied the young man, diligently brushing his hat, which had fallen on to the deck in his successful jump. "I ought not to have waited, but I never can see a big boy beating a little boy without interfering, and I stopped to separate them." "The big boy would call you a fool for your pains," replied the man, smiling. "It won't do to stop the fight always; I tried it not long ago be- tween a man and his wife, and got the worst of it." The young man said no more, but picking up his portmanteau, passed on. The passengers were in the usual confusion, children running hither and thither, and nurses-in eager pursuit; women- push- ing and crowding to get the most comfortable seats, and men with wives and baskets, and some- times babies in their arms, wandering about to find their own state-rooms. The steamer glided swiftly through the channel, and-the young stranger stood almost alone in the stern of the boat taking a last look-at Albion's chalky cliffs as they receded from his sight. His reverie had quite as-much to do ith the land to which he was going -as to the one he was leaving behind; a touch startled him out of his musings, and he felt a soft, hand laid on his shoul- der. "Why, Mr. Greenwood!  how fortunate that we should meet here," exclaimed a familiar voice. "Mrs. Stapleton!" he 'said; with astonishment, taking the offered hand; " so you are going home at 'last?" "Yes," she replied, sadly, casting down her eyes.   $:7:6     *:HawEthorndean. *"2"iahftedito'go long since; I have urged it again ahdi'"a'ih; -it'would not be now, but circumstances render it'bsolutely ntecessary."

"Do you know who he is?" she asked.  "Only that he is a priest, H have not' heard his name;; b';bW'tv we'rCatholics cariC have our mass if we wish." She did not reply; tears were in her eyes; and' th'e essel at that moment beginning. to roll, she thought it more prudent to retire.   Repentance at Leisure,    3" "Here we are, together again," exclaimed Harry Greenwood, as he threw himself into his berth that night, "and for nearly two weeks probably;- Well, it was not of my seeking this time; I accept it as clearly providential; even Ned can't get-over that. -Lovely young creature! so changed in this -short time!

To think of 'this blithe, pretty creature tied for life to this sot; if men are brutes, certainly girls are fools;" and with this comforting reflection he composed himself to sleep. For a day or two Mrs. Stapleton was too ill to appear at meals or in the saloon; during this time Mr. Greenwood made the acquaintance of the priest, and found ito his astonishment one who knew Marion well; it was good Father Sheridan, who had -been to his native land to bid adieu to his aged mother, and was now returning to his field of labor; he was evidently glad to, hear of Marion that she was homeward bound. Mr. Greenwood expressed the hope that the presence of her former friend and pastor would prove a comfort to her and do her good. "Ah! she will hardly .seek her old padre," he replied. "Who- would have thought my pet Marion," he said, as if speaking to himself, "would have done as she has?" "She has repented long ago, in dust and ashes," said Greenwood. "Repented! What do you know of her repent- ance?"Father, Sheridan looled' sharply at his: 32*   838    i-  iaize I -tolvdea young friend' as he' spoke. The criInson blood suffused his face as he hesitatingly answered, in a ,low tone, '"I have already been called to protect )er from ,her husband's violence."

".Yes, Father, but I was the only person near with whom she- had sufficient acquaintance to ask help in, such -an emergency." Father Sheridan made ,no reply, and Harry felt that he had more to say, but deferred it for the- present; In time Marion appeared at the table, pale, dis- pirited and anxious; seeing from symptoms which she had learned to know and feel keenly, that her husband's daily potations were getting deeper and deeper; what should she do if there were to come ,'i crisis here? : The intimacies of steamboat life in a voyage of any length are proverbial, and Mr. Stapleton had no difficulty in finding several of the hail-fellow fraternity, who diank and gambled with him from morning till night. He had wit and good breeding enough to keep these Companions from  his, wife, but he left her to go her own way. She evidently avoided Father Sheridan, taking a place at table far removed from his vicinity, neither did he appa-. rently seek her. In, the cold days, when the warmth was necessary for his work, Mr. Greenwood would take shis -po rtfolio- into the public saloon, Marion would bring her work or a book and sit beside him; these were all the interviews the young people sought with each other, certainly innocent and:               .       .   Reupentance at Leisure.   37 public enough to satisfy the most exact ; but- Father Sheridan was not satisfied. On Sunday Mass was said on the forward deck, for the steerage passen- cgers, who were mostly Irish and Germans. Mr. Greenwood urged upon Marion the duty of going forward with him; but she declined, and he went alone.' After the Holy Sacrifice, the priest sent for Mr, Greenwood to hi-: state-room. :." Are you very busy'?" he said. "-My .son, I have a good deed for you to do, if you have the disposition." Harry assured him he was ready for any good work. "Come here, then, -to-morrow, bring your tools; they tell me you are a famous architect; why didn't you tell me yourself? I want you to give me a plan of my poor little church of the Good Shepherd, which I mean to have built as soon as I reach Athlacca, in place of the log house where we now worship; you must come here to sketch it, that I may tell you -what I want." Thus the daily meetings in the saloon were- broken up, and Marion -was left to herself The second day Greenwood worked away at his plan, while Father Sheridan said his office; when the. priest had laid by his breviary, he came and looked over the work, laying his hand affectionately on the shoulder of the young man. "I have heard, your name coupled with Mrs. Stapleton's," he said, speaking very low, "bandied about in the drink- ing saloon over their cups; and it must not be: I trust you entirely; you are both innocent in' this matter, but Marion's name, for her mother's as well as her own sake, must not be spoken lightly. - Do you understand me, my son?" , , +y   "3810 ....tHlawtho/ndean. - "Perfectly," replied the young man; "I will do Your -bidding. -Give me your blessing, father." The priest blessed him fervently, and the work went on witthout/another word of Marion or her affairs whleie hgood father was happy, and even jolly over ..the projected church. Mr.. Stapleton had again succumbed to the in- fluence of his pet vice, and was a terror to all who came near him; and Harry Greenwood, with the approbation of Father Sheridan, watched with him night after night, his wife having been forbidden by the ship's surgeon to come near him. It was in the midst of one of his most fearful nights, when the sick man raved with delirium, that the cry of "icebergs" came from the lookout, and was rever- berated through the ship. They were approaching the coast of Newfoundland, the weather had grown 7 intensely cold, and the captain had prophesied the vicinity of these dangerous neighbors; only a moment -passed after the cry when the vessel struck, and -rebounded like a cork. The night -was' fearfully thick and dark, and pitiless hail was spreading its chilly covering over every rope and shroud. The first blow had brought the passengers out 'of their berths;, the second brought all who were able to 'the deck. The madman over whom Mr. Greenwood watched had been wild with terror; two stout- men besides himself were required to nold -him;,:but -they fled at the first crash, Harry sthi keeping guard. In the midst of this dreadful consternation above and below, Marion rushed into the state-room where her husband, exhausted by his own violence, was at-length prostrate. She.   Repentance at Leisure.    38i was but half-dressed; her hair hanging wildly about, while a cloak had been hastily thrown ove- her shoulders. '  O, Mr. Greenwood," she cried in terror, "we are lost; the steamer will be crushed, she will go to pieces here, in this wild sea, and Hwhere shall I go?" -She sunk on the floor in utter despair. "You will seek Father Sheridan," he replied, endeavoring to control his own emotion, " or shall I bring him here?" "He will not come to me; he knows how I have avoided him. O, will he?" she exclaimed, raising her eyes imploringly.  Mr. Greenwood waited only to assure himself that the opiates he had been all night administer- ing to the brutalized husband had taken effect, before he went out to seek comfort and help for the wife, who seemed almost frantic with mental an- guish. He found the priest in the least frequented corner of the forward deck, vested in his priestly stole, calmly listening to. the confessions 6f the terror-stricken emigrants, who crowded about him as their protector. Till now Harry had not realized the extent of their danger; but before him, around him, and above him, were mountains of ice, whose frowning towers and battlements ranged far above the ship on every side. The large steamer, with its ribs of iron, was like an egg-shell in the grasp of a giant; only one tight clasp of-those terrific fingers was necessary to crush her to atoms. Pray- ers and oaths, cries and groans were all about him, but he was calm with an unnatural calmness; he thought of his brother Earnest, and the sea where   Lt'g Act   .fiawthotndean. his bones lay hidden, and then his own past life stood but before him act by act, in letters of fire. Father Sheridan beckoned to him, and he knelt to his: confesSor; never before had life seemed to him worth half so much, when a few moments were so precious in his preparation for eternity. When lie rose from his knees, he whispered his message to the priest. "'I will go, my son; I have done what I can for these poor children; stay with them and comfort them,. at the same time putting the beads which he held into his hand. Harry understood  his mission, and as he ded the devotions of those simple, earnest souls, they certainly did not doubt that the dear Jesus whose holy name was so often on their lips was near to help them, and that the Blessed Mother, in her love and pity, was praying :for them. In the course of an hour Father Sheri- dan came again among his poor people, supporting Marion, who was deeply veiled; there he instructed his little flock with thoughts that came home to their needy souls, and, manifested their effect in the growing calmness and quiet which prevailed amongst. them. Wearisome were the night hours, the more' wearisome that there was nothing to do; no-earthly power could help them, no effort of their own could make or mar their fate. Boats were useless, so completely were they enveloped iln the ice, but every boat belonging to the steamer was, unshackled. and ready for use. The gray of morning came at last; the first light displayed the rugged -peaks of bare blue ice jutting high in the air; the wheels, of the steamer were immovable,   Repentance tat Letisure.   383 and the only motion was to toss about':andt float along with these terrific companions; any moment they might turn over by their own -weight, and engulf all the human loves and hopes with which that proud vessel was freighted. The, sun rose bright and clear, defining imaginary castles, para- pets and forts- among the glistening: peaks:- at that hour Father Sheridan offered the Holy Sacri- fice for himself and-his faithful company, and Mar- ion for the first time since her unprincipled mar-  riage, received the Bread of Life. The continued sight of danger which at first view thrills the soul with horror, by familiarity becomes less and less fearful, till hope, the last thing to die from the human heart, revives, takes courage and drives out despair. All day those floating glaciers held them as with grappling hooks; the men sauntered down to the cabin where the women and children had been driven by the extreme cold; another night of dread suspense and little rest, but toward the dawning of the next daysthe fearful suspense gave way to sudden relief; the paddle wheels began to move slowly, and with the first glimmer of light came the passengers to the deck; there was no ice to be seen except on the borders of the horizon; God had sent His angel and delivered them. How many of the vows made in those hours of panic were remembered and paid, when the sun of life again shone brightly and the waves ran smoothly? The vessel had been somewhat damaged, but not so as to impede her progress, and the remaining days went by without adven- ture. The remembrance of that horrible night   384    H- awtzorndean. had swo wrought upon Marion, that she was not able again to assemble with the ship's company, but she was not neglected. Father Sheridan, with his inexhaustible fund of kindness and good sense, cheered her lonely hours; rousing her by his counsel, to look at her future calmly, patiently, and with hope.    CHAPTER XXX. TH E QUEEN OF HEARTS. S R. STAPLETON   had given, his agent warning of his return, and a fine house elegantly furnished, in the most eligible part of the city, had been made ready for the reception of himself and wife. To Father Sheridan and Mr. Greenwood he urged the accept- ance of his invitation to make his house their head- quarters, but both the gentlemen had made other arrangements. Mr. Greenwood was bound first of all to his sister; death had broken up his home, and Dora had been for two years in a religious house, butG he had determined to see her at once. He chided himself that between this determination came. a desire not to leave the city without going to Colonel Hartland's. His correspondence with the Doctor had been quite regular, but he had not answered his last letter or announced his probable arrival; an opportunity to be the architect of one of the finest Cathedral Churches in the country, coming to him  through Father Roberts, had brought him home six months sooner than he expected; his three years wanted that time to -their expiration, but he was glad to return-we a33 -385   3.86      Ilawthorndean. cannot say that the splendid opening for his busi- ness:;alone attracted' him. 'The soil of travel removed, lie made his way-at once to Colonel Hartland's. The servant looked blank as he inquired at the door for the ladies, and replied very gravely, that "Miss Benton was within." --He was startled when a slight figure ,appeared in' the drawing-room, dressed in deep black, and for a moment he was unable to speak; What might have happened to his dear friends even in the short time he had not heard from them! A   -few words, however, served to relieve his suspense, for Rosine seeing hisembarrassment, explained that Mrs. Hartland had passed away very suddenly, leaving the 'household without a head. Two years had not changed Rosine mate- rially, and young Greenwood found his early pre- -dilections returning in full force; he had seen nothing like her in his absence, and he knew now, what-he never before acknowledged even to him- self, that here was the pole-star that had guided him in his wanderings, and made him so unim- pressible by all the style and beauty he had met abroad. They  had many subjects of mutual interest--Dora and her chosen path, and Marion and-her choice. Rosine's feelings were a mingling of shame, sorrow, and somewhat of a sister's ten- derness, when she learned that Mrs. Stapleton had really returned; so many times -had she sent them word she-was coming, without fulfilling her promise, that they had learned to think she would :never revisit her native land. The conversation did not once flag' during that long afternoon;   The Queen of Hearts.    387  Harry seemed to have forgotten -that there was any other world than that contained between those four walls. He had proposed to himself to, take the evening train to Philadelphia, and from thence south, to the city where he hoped to find his sister; but the spell was on him, and the evening shades gathered as Rosine listened while he told his- adventures, his trials and pleasures, with the many thoughts of fatherland, that sweetened his some- times arduous labors. She seemed to-have- for- gotten her position as housekeeper, forgotten the -last look at the dining-table before the coming of the Colonel and Ned, and had given no orders about the dessert. Dr. Hartland's step in the hall aroused them, and Mr. Greenwood arose to, go, while Rosine urged his remaining to dinner; thus they stood when Ned entered. Having seen the arrival in the paper, he had hastened home, eager to be the first to bring the' news to Rosine. "So you've forestalled me again, Harry," he exclaimed; "and finished all the matters, and told the whole story," he added, taking the young man cordially by the hand. "Rosine, that gentleman, I see, is bound to get the better of me. Going? no, not yet; don't talk of such a thing. Philadel- phia!" he continued, pointing to the clock, "-there is no other train, and we have you for the night. So you came over with Tom Stapleton and his wife. Why did you put yourself in such a mess?' "The company was not particularly of my iseek- ing," replied the young man; "I had not-seen them for several months until I met thee on board the steamer very unexpectedly."   388      Hawthorndean, "And so you've come home," continued the Doctor, "to take the responsibility of the splendid church , that is to be on -- Street. I saw Father Roberts. yesterday; -he- told me of this piece of your good luck, and Hasked him of another piece of news I heard in my travels, but one might as well soundfthe ocean. I heard Laura was thinking of taking -the veil; it is a pity she hadn't taken it long ago." "'There can, be no truth in that story," replied Rosine, in a very dignified manner. "You see how she shuts me up, Harry. Well, here's the Colonel, and now we'll go to dinner." Colonel Hartland received Mr. Greenwood in his ol, 'cordial, kindly manner, but the more than two years had-not passed as lightly over him as the others; his hair and beard were silvered, he was graver and: more quiet, just as tender and fatherly towards: Rosine, but not -so full of life and vivacity, The:conversation turned on Captain Hartland. "Ah, you'll hardly know Aleck;" said. the father, shaking his head sadly; "he lives between here and Hawthorndean, restless; unsettled, unhappy; there are only two people who give him any com- fort;-Rosa" and her mother." "It all comes of marriage," said the Doctor, savagely; "cursed marriage-don't you have any thing to do with it, Harry." "Indeed, Ned, I don't agree with-you," replied Gr:eediWood; "I don't call that a true marriage." r'"True marriage-fudge!"' retorted the Doctor, pet- tishy. Show me- one thoroughly happy couple; now I pin you down to it ,show me this rara avis."   T -he Queen of Hearts.    389 Harry looked round in thought among their mutual friends, and was shocked to own, even to -himself, that he could not find one of which he was quite sure. "You don't succeed, ha!" said Dr. Hartland, after waiting, as he thought, a reasonable time for reply; "I knew you would not Well, let me tell you, what you call a true marriage is like the philosopher's stone-nowhere." Rosine looked up, surprised and indignant "Ah, my -little Miss,' continued .the Doctor, "you- on't believe me either, I see. Incredulous youth{!"' "No, Ned, I don't believe you; I can't believe you." She spoke very earnestly, with tears in her eyes. "I know one at -least"Knowing that she referred directly to her father and mother, the Doctor did not reply; he saw that the reproach indirectly cast on her womanhood by his severe and sweeping remark had wounded her feelings. Mr. Greenwood saw this also, and took up the cudgels rather out of gallantry and compassion for her, than because he knew the best thing to say. "I'm not posted in these matters, Ned," he replied, kindly; "still I know that if your assertion even be true, matrimony is no less a sacrament, and designed for the happiness of us fallen mortals; perhaps the'fault is in the people we know, and not in the thing itself. After all, I am of the opinion of a modern writer, who says that life (and I suppose it may apply to matrimonial life) with all its trials would be less hard, if at the beginning we faced the fact, that it was to be medicine and not wine." 33*   39o      Hzawthorndean.  "Capital!a splendid get-off, Hal!" cried the Doctor; throwing down his knife and fork, and laughing heartily. "Bravo! you'll start fair, any way! Now I take my physic solus!" "Hairry is right," interrupted the Colonel, who had not- before joined :in the conversation. "You, Ned, were- always looking for some Utopian state, where. men will. cease to bet men, and women women. If people&.begun life with more- sober yiews of what life really is, we should see fewer mistakes. But tell us, Harry, about your tour abroad, and leave matrimony till your time comes." -. Mr. Greenwood gladly changed the subject by narrating many of his adventures, in a manner so charmingly'simple and truthful, that he held the attention of his listeners till midnight. "-The Coinmodore ought to have been proud of such- :a- boy," Was Colonel- Hartland's comment to his son the next day. "He'd be a' great man, if he wasn't so good," was the reply of'Doctor Hartland. - Rosine did not' fly to seek her sister upon her return; she- dreaded the interview, and waited till the-:Colonel offered to accompany her. Dr. Hart- land had -used his eloquence to persuade her it was n-ot hers duty, but her conscience was better instructed. After the first embrace, the first real :look: at, Marion, the first near knowledge of her c: ondition!-and, prospects, the great gulf that- had gaped between them was bridged by a tiny foot- bridge, over which Rosine's heart leaped fearlessly. Here Nvas another object for- her love and care; she had won Aleck Hartland from dire despair, and   The, Qzeen of Hearts.    391 had passed- him over in a measure to her mother; now -she would work for her disheartened sister,. wearing a life-chain that fretted into her very heart. She persuaded Marion to do what she had promised Father Sheridan should be done, to go to Hawthorndean and seek the forgiveness of her parents for her undutiful conduct. This was not a difficult task, for Marion, with the new tie developing in her nature, was longing for her mother, and the visit was accomplished without Mr. Stapleton. Father Sheridan had been before her, and prepared her way to the hearts of her grieved parents. No accusing word was spoken, no reproach uttered, though three years had gone -by in which she had not once had her father's blessing; now he looked at his child with a sad, grave, yet affectionate look, which said more to her heart than any words;' his prophecy had been fulfilled so soon, so entirely, and with such dreadful bitterness; wedded to one whom she could neither love nor respect, every friendly face seemed to bring before her the criminal nature of her fault. During her short stay at Hawthorndean the "Athlacca News," the weekly paper of that famous town, came accidentally into her hands, and this paragraph met her eye: "It will be a matter of rejoicing, to the friends of Hon. Horatio Leighton, late of this town, to learn that his seat in Congress is secured, his .well-known honor and patriotism insure him -permanent- success as a public man. Marion sunk down into a seat: as she read these words, and- hid her face in her hands; allther  young love revived, it poured over her in a whelm-   392     ,  lawttiorndean. ing wave, leaving her a stranded wreck. Her mother found'her thus, and with heaven-directed hand essayed to comfort, and bind up those gaping self-m ade wounds. "'Yes; dear daughter," she said, in reply to the outpourfi-her sorrow,as she bemoaned happi- ness so wantonly wasted--"yes, I would gladly see you happy'; but O, so much more rejoiced am I to see yoit penitent, and resolved to do right You imust once and forever put away all these thoughts from your mind; if indulged, they will partake of the nature of sin; the past can be nothing to you now but a subject of contrition; in the present, the good God has given you the best gift He could grant, be satisfied with it, and bend all your ener- xies and thoughts to the one desire, that your child nay be all that it ought, to be." Marion went back to her husband with new im- ulses and new hopes; and well she needed them or'in her absence the demon of love of strong [rink had, seized him, and she found him in the nidst of an attack of delirium. Rosine came to er assistance, resisting the stoutest efforts of Dr. lartland to prevent her, attendance on such a :ene. In that chamber of devils she was taught a entirely new phase of life, returning to her home tdder and wiser. Ned did not scold her' in those ays or -bend his eyes upon her, they stood more than equality, rather he leaned upon her; she nused his solitary hours, cheered his moments of :pression, read and studied with him; entered into e' wants of his poor patients with a motherly art, and became to him in truth, entirely a sister.   he Queen of Hearts.    393 Now and then it occurred to him that it was a, somewhat lonely life Rosine led, almost without companions of her own age, but she was happy, quiet, and contented. A ride to Hawthorndean for a few days sojourn, a return of Alex now and then to his father's roof, to consult his dear Rosa about the country home he was planning; an empty home, but for the dear helpful care of his second mother, Mrs. Benton; these, with calls from Harry Greenwood, unlike 'sangels visits," being neither "few nor far between," these varied the monotony of Rosine's life. After Christmas came Marion's baby, a lovely, delicate girl, one'of those far-seeing infants like pictures of thLd Holy Innocents, or Raphael's St. John gazing into the face of the Infant Jesus; her look had in it something from a life beyond and above, as if her tiny thoughts were whispered to her dear guardian angel, ever at her side. Well has an author said, "A babe is a well- spring of joy in a house;" to Mrs. Stapleton it was like cold water to the parched and thirsty soul; she looked upon her treasure with a reverence she had never felt for any thing earthly. - Even Ned, baby hater as he professed to be, could not but acknow- ledge that the little LIily was singularly beautiful; he was sure she could not live, she was so good, and essentially frightened the young mother by telling her his forebodings. For awhile after the birth of his daughter the graceless father returned to his manhood, under the influence of those baby smiles; the wife's heart beat with hope; but as saith -the Scripture in the proverb, he went back to his debasing vices- after   394      eawfthorndean., the novelty wore away, and Marion sank to the old sharme and sorrow. Two years glided thus over our friends, without great change; Mr. Greenwood rising. to' stand among the first in his profession, and to be honor- ably spoken of by masters in the art both at home and abroad; but in the-affairs of his heart he still seemed to linger, to take no decided step forward. Tlhat he loved Rosine Benton with all the strength of a true earnest nature, he had not a shadow of doubt, and that the love was no passing fancy, but the deep growth of years of patient waiting; but a doubt of others had entered his mind, and had hindered his outwardD progress. Since his return from Europe he had seen, as never before, the devotion of Dr. Hartland to- Rosine, and the fond affection with which she met all his wants; he' knew that his sister Dora, the first choice of his friend, was forever shut out from him, and what more natural than that his love should be transferred to Rosine? - The young man perplexed himself day by day with these, thoughts, and he sometimes worried himself into a state of scrupulousness as to his :right:-to continue his intimate visits at Colo- nel Hartland's under these circumstances' Fort a. long time -he had revolved the pros and cons of this question in his mind, the probabilities and improbabilities, putting the question fairly and squarely before his faithful conscience. -Our Harry, v  ,ith .altl his moral bravery, was modest in love, diffident of -.his success;, and instead of assisting him in his dilemma, the Doctor, who saw it plainly, was constantly saying or doing something- from   The- Queen of  Hearts.  :395 his propensity to teaze, that added to 'the young man's perplexities; he was at least in no haste to give Rosine into any other keeping than his own. At length came an imperative call to,-Mr. Green- wood to be the architect of a Cathedral, and re- ligious houses attached, in one of our growing western cities; if he accepted the position, it would require frequent and protracted separation from the object of his dearest affections. He could not, and would not go away and work at a subject which required all his energies, leaving the destiny of his love undecided. He had already given his promise for a family gathering at Hawthorndean, to which place he was a stranger; he determined that that occasion should fix his plans for the future. This visit was to be a surprise party, to inaugurate the introduction of the little Lily to her grandfather. Mr Benton never left his home, and the ceaseless demands of her husband upon her time and strength had kept Marion a prisoner. The Colonel and the Doctor, with Rosine, Marion and the babe, were to form the party, and Dr. Hartland had urged Harry's presence, as all that was wanting to make the visit complete. 'We will not analyze Rosine's feelings, she certainly-was in high glee at the thought of introducing her friend to dear Hawthorndean, the dearest :spot on earth to her heart. A joyous welcome was given to our travellers it the hospitable: mansion, and the Doctor immedi ateiy inquired if the old gray were still on his legs he wished to,engage him at once for Paradise "Ah, Rosa,-dear," he said, going on to the veranda where' she was already pointing out to,-Mr. Green   396      Hawthorndean. wood the charming scenery bathed in the mellow light of the setting sun, "ah, if we can but bring back the thoughts and feelings of that first day in Paradise-vve were young then," he added. "Love's young dream, eh, Rosine?" "A dream that knows no waking," she replied, mischievously. Harry was annoyed, he was working himself out of his usually placid state of mind in spite of his preparation; after a moment he drew from' his pocket a small drawing-book and pencil, and went on with a plan for a rustic summer-house, for which Aleck had -asked, Dr. Hartland remembered this never-failing resort of his friend when disquieted, and seeing the disturbance, continued to teaze him with sweet- words and tender amenities toward Rosine, till the young man suddenly threw down his pencil and went off across the lawn. "There, I've roused the evil one in your saint, Rosa," said the Doctor, as he disappeared. "Have you displeased Harry?" inquired Rosine, innocently., "I thought he left rather abruptly." "Yes, I'm displeasing him all the time; I won- der if I must believe that you do not see it." "See what?" replied Rosine, looking into his face inquiringly. "Yes, I must believe it," said the Doctor; "there is at least ignorance in that look." "I'm much obliged to you, Ned; I dare say I look very silly;. but please tell me what you mean: by displeasing Harry. Have you quarrelled? I thoulght you were always the best of friends." "Ah, yes," said Ned, "the very best; but it is   The Queen of- Hearts.    397 not in the nature of saintship in the flesh, nowa- days at least, to bear every thing, and I really think I stand very much in the way of this young man." "Do explain yourself, Ned. How can you pos- sibly interfere in any way with Harry? You talk in mysteries." "It is only your lonely life that makes it a mystery, and prevents your understanding what I mean; I warrant Marion will explain all before you've been together twenty-four hours." "You talk in enigmas, Dr. Hartland," said Rosine, blushing crimson; "I don't think -you understand yourself." "Ah, you have it now," he replied, laughing; "I can read your blush. The thought came with the suggestion of Marion, very- naturally." Rosine arose to leave him. "Stay, sister," he said, taking her hand, "I will talk plainly, if you wish it." "You have said all that I can -hear," she replied, with dignity, "unless you change the subject." - "I'm sorry, Rosa," he said, coaxingly. ",Don't be offended; I was only comparing you in my mind with other women; I don't know of but one that approaches you." "That will do, Ned," replied Rosine, chasing away the slight frown from her face by a sunny smile; " others don't agree with you in your kind opinion." "I take a good deal of pride, you think," he said, gayly, "in my own training." "Go, find Harry," was her gentle reply. 34   -398   H- -awthorndean. Dr. Hartland obeyed unhesitatingly, and came upon the young man in the furthest corner of the lawn, among a clump of old arbor-vitaes which Aleck had trained into many fantastic shapes. He -had thrown- himself full length upon a mossy seat -that had ,been planted in the midst of this principal group. The Doctor came upon him quite unex- pectedly, and he sprang to his feet at once, as if he had been interrupted in some important matter. "Don't hurry away again, Harry," said the Doctor, standing before him, and looking at him keenly; "I have come for you." "Why should you trouble yourself about me?" was the cold reply, in a constrained voice. "At her bidding," said the Doctor. "Don't make a fool of yourself, Harry, but go back to the piazza like a man, and finish up this business, which, unlike your usual prompt way of doing, has been left hanging by the eyelids too long." "Ned," replied the young man, with a touch of sadness in his voice, "don't joke me there again. I cannot bear it. I ought not to have come here. I shall leave in the morning, for-I must go to work again." "You talk like a crazy fellow, Hal! I really believe you are in love, and like all genuine lovers, take to talking nonsense! My advice to you is to make a clean breast of it." "Don't talk so, Ned; you exasperate me," replied young Greenwood, in an excited tone. "I am in love, I'm not afraid orashamed to own it; but do you think for a moment I would compete with you, or ask for what you are yourself seeking?"   tf , *                  - * IThe Queenr of Hearls.    399 "Now, by mry troth, Hal, you are a jewel, and carry your principles of right further than most lovers; but I can assure you, on my honor, that you need give yourself no uneasiness about me. I am much obliged to you for your consideration; believe me, there is no ground for your suspicion," he added, looking into his eyes; "there, shake hands; now begone." Greenwood needed no further stimulus. After an hour's wandering by the last rays of sunset and the light of the rising moon, Dr. Hartland returned to the house and found the family assem- bled, but Rosine and Mr. Greenwood were not come in. The evening had grown cool and damp, and various hopes and fears were expressed as to the sufficiency of Rosine's clothing for this late hour,; the Colonel was restive, and was on the point of instituting a search with waterproofs: and shawls on his arm, when the delinquent couple entered the hall, Rosine running immediately to her room on the plea -of wet feet. Harry was flushed, bright and eager in his look, and the Doctor argued success. Rosine did not appear again during the evening, the little Lily was rest- -less, and she excused herself, to watch with the mother. When the family were about to separate for the night, Mr. Greenwood waited in the hall. Ned whispered in his ear, "I see, hearts are trumps, and you have the ace." "Ace and queen," retorted Harry, "and I am after the king," he added, turning again into the parlor, where the two old friends, Mr. Benton and Colonel Hartland, were still lingering.-   CHAPTER XXXI. AFTER STORM COMES SUNSHNE. HE must find Laura, whom we left with a weight of sorrow and remorse crushing her heart, and wearing like a fetter into her young life. With the impulsiveness of her nature, when the last hope of reconciliation with her husband had died out, she -had desired the seclusion of the cloister, but this, with her husband still living, was impossible. She had buried the bitterness of her remorse, and found ,solace where the penitent one is never refused, and contented herself with a life nearly as secluded 'from society as if she had taken the vows of a religieuse, submitting her will, which had so nearly been a rock of shipwreck to her soul, to the guidance of good Father Roberts, dwelling under the same roof with the orphans, spending herself and her means in the service of Christ's poor. She too was an orphan, her father having been brought to her from the battle-field in his coffin, and buried with military display, and thus the grave had shult down over her last hope from this world; the deep black she had worn after this heavy stroke she had never removed, she wore it 400   After Storm comes Sunshine.   4c still for her deeper grief, her more than widowhoo Letters from Miss Greenwood during her novitiat and the society of Sister Agnes, were her chim worldly solace; now and then a glimpse of Rosir rewarded her patient waiting, although her friend -lips were closed on the subject of deepest interes both from a sense of delicacy and Captain Har land's expressed wish. There came a time when these visits were mot frequent-after Rosine returned from Hawthorn dean the betrothed of Harry Greenwood. He ha from many interviews with his sister, imbibed he firm  faith in Laura's innocence of the crime o '.which her husband held her guilty, and natural12 he imparted this faith to his well-beloved, wh( accepted it gladly as the echo of her own heart, s( without comment or question from  the still faith less Ned, interviews between Rosine and Laur were multiplied. Years of such suffering as Mrs Hartland's could not fail to tell on her whole nature spiritually it had brought her to a life of constant ,penance, leading her by the way of the Cross tc the sure refuge of the disconsolate; physically, she had lost her bounding pulse and hearty laugh, her bold, fearless manner and self-assured step, and a shanime-faced pensive shadow was fixed upon her countenance. A call was made at this time upon the religious houses of the north for the hospitals of one of the -southern cities, where fever was, raging. Miss 'Greenwood, had just taken her final vows, and from henceforth we  know her only as Sister Angela. She had been sent at once with a band of co- '3 *,            *  ' ' ':   4002      Hawthorndean. workers to New Orleans, and Laura wished to accompany the two sisters going from the House of the Infant Jesus to the same destination; sle wished to help, to be of some service, if she could not be one of them. Sister Agnes placed no obsta- cle in the way; perhaps a change might benefit her young friend, and Laura entered on her new posi- tion with something of her former energy, and the help and comfort of Sister Angela were like sweet flowers in the bleak desert of her life. Months of such work as she had never before known invigor- ated her mind and body, she saw others more abandoned than herself, and- helped to soothe the misery of many a poor soul whose life was darker than her- own. In time the yellow-fever increased to a pesti- 'lence, the panic-stricken inhabitants fleeing in :many instances, and leaving the dying and dead uncared for. It was the mission of the Sisters to seek out these forsaken ones, as often in the houses of the wealthy as in the hovels of the poor; all alike shared their succor. The hospitals were crowded, enclosures were- improvised, where hun- dreds in every stage of this dire disease were brought for the tender offices of the religieuse. -The enemy spared neither age, sex, rank, nor pro- fession; physicians were stricken down in their efforts for others, and were- carried to the charnel house in a few hours  Requiem  masses were chanted for priests and Sisters who had-fallen in 'the midst 'of their arduous labors. Laura looked with envy upon these' shrouded martyrs, and worlked with ;new'vigor; onerous- duties had sepa-   After Slorm  comes Sunshine. 340 rated her from Sister Angela, who was called by her Superior to the care of some of the worst cases in the temporary hospital. A gentleman, evidently a man of wealth and position, had been found at dead of night in one of the large hotels, locked into his room in an advanced stage of this fearful fever, his friends and- destiny unknown. Sister Angela had received him; though every bed was filled, she found place- for another amid the groans of the dying and the rattling of the death-cart. His appearanc- was melancholy in the extreme; his skin cold and clammy, presented the direful hue of the advanced patient, changing already fromn the bright orange to the dull brown; the pulse-was feeble and inter- mittent, and the breathing irregular and labored. He was in the vigor of manhood, with a foreign air, and evidently had been a man of mark; now his words were few and incoherent, and his wan- dering eye singled out Sister Angela, and never left watching her as she ,smoothed his pillow, bathed his head and hands, and busied herself con- stantly in a subdued and quiet way for his comfort. The physician, as he looked at him, showed no hope in his face, and soon after whispered to his attendant, "He cannot last long; if he has any thing to say to his friends, it should be said at once," and passed on to the next patient. Sister Angela bent over him to see if reason held her seat, that she might help, if possible, the soul in its death-struggle. Words came at length, anrid unexpectedly he spoke in English. "Dying, did he say?" he inquired with a gasp.   :-o4     Hawthorndean. "Very low," replied the voice at his Side. "Have you any words you would say?" "But I must not die!" he cried, grinding his teeth. "I'm young yet, and shall weather it." "God calls whom he pleases," was the reply, "and we have only to prepare to meet Him." "Mon Dieu!" he exclaimed, with a sneer; "I did not believe in Him. Ah, yes, I threw all that away long ago; but I can't die," he groaned, writhing and twisting in his cot. The Sister prayed for the poor wretch; it was all there was left to do. "Message for friends," he continued. "Message! did he say? I have none, all lost,-perdu!" He turned to the wall for a moment and was quiet. Sister Angela thought he might sleep, and attempted to go to the next cot, when she heard a low stifled groan, and the sick man rose wildly, tearing away the curtains and sinking back. "Don't you leave me!" he cried frantically, clutching the Sister's dress as she returned. "He says I must speak; yes, I have something to say--pencil- paper." The articles were at hand. "You don't know me?" the Sister shook her head. "I know- you," he muttered, fixing upon her his piercing black eyes, over which the film of death had not yet gathered. "Yes, there is one wrong I must right ; it may help me there, if there be any here- after." He grew feeble, faltered, and sank under the exertion. Stimulants were applied, and Sister Angela waited-with her patient, prayerful spirit- till he should again speak. "Write," he said at length, "his name," he added,-trying to raise him- self 'on his elbow.   J After Storm comes Sunshine.  40o "Yes," replied his attendant quietly, "what is it?' "Captain Hart-," he articulated very feebly, hi; voice dying away in a struggle. "Captain Hartland?" interrogated the Sister, a; a light seemed to break upon her mind, like ; flash from an unseen cloud; her own voice slight! trembling. "Is it Captain Hartland?" "Aleck is what she called him," he said wan deringly. "Yes. tell me what I shall write for Captaii Alexander Hartland," inquired the Sister, realizing the need of haste. The- man slowly raised his hand to his forehead as if to collect his scattered senses, and bringing it down upon the paper with all the force of whic] he was capable, he said with a terrible oath, "Tel him I deceived him; she was never mine:" an( again his mind wandered. Sister Angela hesitated but a moment; enougl had been said already to lift the dark cloud fron Laura's heart; she felt. this, as she looked at the miserable man before her, striving with the fev gasps of his flickering life to undo his own wicker labor for years. She knew only pity for him, an( she prayed to the good God, if peradventure ther, were yet hope for this soul,:about to appear befor, his judge. It was some moments before he agail opened his eyes, or rallied from the state of uncon sciousness into which he had relapsed. The Siste had written on the paper, "I protest in my dyinl hour, that Laura Hartland is innocent of that o which her husband accuses her."  Once more hi 'opened his eyes, still clear with the light of reason   406      Eawthzo rndean. and with evident anxiety turned towards her, while she, stooping over him, read the paper distinctly. "More," he said eagerly; "I seized the ring, their wedding-ring, when she lay helpless in a swoon." This was added, and with the last energies of a strong nature, by a powerful effort of will he snatched the pencil and signed his name, "Etienne Le Compte," almost as legibly as in his palmiest days. -This done,;he sunk rapidly; all efforts to turn his mind to any thing beyond this life were useless; all that night be breathed still, but did not speak, and his pulse was imperceptible. Pray- ers' constant and fervrent were said for this soul which seemed to have abandoned God; but he sunk away and made no sign; having lived as the fool liveth, he died as the fool dieth. Sister Angela had no time, directly to make use of the intelli- gence she had gained; the pestilence raged more and more, and lest she should be stricken down in the. midst of her labors, she imparted the precious secret to her Father Confessor, with the under- standing that if she were taken away, he was to reveal it to those most interested. But at length the ,early frosts of autumn checked the raging scourge, and her first care was for Captain Hart- land. The difficult task of bringing back, her thoughts to the living was accomplished, and this letter was dispatched. 'NTEW ORLEANS, September, 18-. "CAPTAIN A, HARTLAND: "'My Dear Sir--It is my pleasing duty to inform you, that the cloud which has hung like a pall over   After Storm cosmes Sunshi:e.   407 your life, has been- lifted by the hand of death. I enclose the evidence of your wife's innocence, which I have long felt was unquestionable. I will only add, that this paper was -written by me at the request of the signer, and the name was subscribed by him almost in the agonies of death. Praying our dear Lord that this may relieve your heart of- a heavy burden, I am, Very truly, yours,   ANGELA." The letter reached the residence of Colonel Hartland in due time, and came into the hands of the Doctor, who eyed it suspiciously, and not without some curiosity; recognizing as he did the hand-writing at once, there could be no other like it to him, even now, and this was the first time he ever felt an impulse to open a letter not addressed to himself. He turned it over and over again-no, there it was, fairly written in Dora's clear, bold hand, "Captain Alexander Hartland, U. S. N.' "Ah, how shut, out she must be from us all," he said to himself, "not to know that Aleck has resigned." His brother was at Hawthorndean, that dear paradise for souls wearied with contending against the ills of life, and the letter was at once'forwarded to him in his retreat. Here he had built himself a tiny cottage below the lawn, where he could look up to the mansion of his friends, and be alone when he chose. He was in the rustic arbor which Harry had planned, now covered with vines of his own planting; he was going over the dark days of the past, thinking, O, how relentlessly, of the   - 4o8      -aw thorndean. knowledge that this day years ago had brought to' him; the anniversary had never been forgotten, the ring still rested on his finger, and a ghastly bitter smile spread over his sunken pallid cheek as he gazed at it. ' Never, never!" he said, in a cold, stern voice, as if replying to some inward pleading. "No, never!" A sound of a footstep met his ear, and he arose hastily; it was only the blind boy, his chief com- panion, bringing him a letter, which he held most carefully in both 'his hands, as if it we're made of some brittle substance. The Captain, took it carelessly, looked at the post-mark, then turned to the dear boy, whom he had learned to love with almost paternal affection. He thought the missive was from some of his old navy friends, and he had hardly curiosity to read it, so he slowly broke the seal, turning to Willie, and holding one arm about him as he read. "Good God!" he exclaimed, when he saw the purport of the letter, the blood rushing to his heart. Willie turned anxiously to his friend, and stroked his beard with his small hand. "Uncle Aleck, does it tell you bad news?" inquired the child. "Who knows?" replied the Captain, abstractedly, his voice trembling as he spoke. "Let's go to mamma," said the boy, affection- -ately, "she will know." They went together, hand in hand, Willie really the stronger of the two, in that silent, rapid walk. Aleck Hartland gave the: letter and its enclosure to -Mrs. Benton, and hurried away into the library, as -if afraid even of her presence; overwhelmed .   A4ter Storm comes Sunshine.   409 with 'mingled emotions, all of them more or less tinged with the doubts and distrust of the long years of darkness; distance, time were annihilated, and the hours of those dreadful days in a far off land were alone remembered. Presently, there came a low tap at: the door, and a gentle voice, speaking his name; he arose to meet Mrs. Ben- ton, but staggered to a seat, unable even to offer her a chair. "This is so wonderful, such a heaven-sent bless- ing," she said, coming towards him, her face shin- ing with delight, and putting her hand on his bowed head. "Such blessed news! Indeed I am so grateful to the good God for you; you will seek out your wife at once." "But I have wronged her bitterly," he said, his head still bowed on his arm--"wronged her con- stantly in thought and deed, all these years of suffering." "Yes, Aleck," she replied; "years of terrible suffering for you both, let us hope it mayincrease your reward, I know it will; and O, what a weight this will take from many hearts; dear Rosa always had faith in Laura's innocence." "Rosine is a saint," he said, looking up for the first time; "think what she was to me in those first- horrible months. God bless her for it-but I must not wait," he added rising. Eagerness hope, strength, had returned with human sympa- thy; before night he was in the city, with an invi- tation to bring Laura immediately to Hawthorn- dean. He did not pause at his father's residence, he made no delay till he stood at the entrance of 35   -410      hawthorndean. the ,House of the Infant Jesus. The little child who opened the door shook her small head when hle inquired for Mrs. Hartland; and after several ineffectual efforts to explain himself, he asked for the Sister Superior, and was forthwith ushered into her presence. The calm, subdued, chastened spirit of Sister Agnes was melted by, the intelligence, and tears glistened in her eyes, as Captain Hartland imparted to her the news which had so changed everything for him; but Laura was in New Or- leans, to leave, soon-it was uncertain how soon, but probably before he could reach there, and she advised his waiting a few days. ,He wait! he sit still! while she whom he had so deeply and ten- derly loved was repudiated! Never. He rushed to his father's house, meeting Rosa at the door just going for a drive with Harry, who had lately returned from a long sojourn in the far west. Cap- tain Hartland pulled them both back into the house, with an earnestness that made them fear for his senses, and taking from his memorandum book the letter of Sister Angela, he thrust it into Rosine's hand. Harry Greenwood stood by her side while she gave one glance through the lines, penetrating at once- to their meaning, and'turning to Aleck, who stood as-if waiting to be gone, she clasped her arms about his neck, utterinig no words but tears. "Thank God," said Harry, as .he closed the letter, " right must prevail; and what a joy to my dear sister Dora to be the instrument. -Aleck, let me congratulate you; we will have a double wed- ding ne t month, Rosa, if Aleck can wait so lon,."- *    After Stormz comes 'Sunshine.   4-I 1 "Wait, Harry," replied the Captain, soberly;"I am off for New Orleans to-night." "O, do see Ned first, dear Aleck," said Rosine, coaxingly; "it will be' such a triumph for me. I do not care to tell him; we have fought this battle o'er and o'er' again, and the dear"Colonel-'O, here he comes, I must tell him;" and breaking away from Harry, she ran to the hall with the story for the Colonel. He was at first stunned by the sud- denness of the news, and then joined heartily in the general rejoicing, saying, "I- hope Ned will not be sorry; he is rancorous in this matter." "He ought to sorrow with me," replied Captain Hartland, "that his fierce injustice added fuel to the fire in my bones; you may tell him--but I am off by the quickest route," and taking his hat he hurried out before the Colonel could summon his thoughts to say, "Welcome her here," which was in his heart. He- reached New Orleans, wearied but   not exhausted, to find the band of Sisters had left only the day before for the north, Laura-travelling with them. One night's attempt-at rest, and he started again, overtaking them in Baltimore. Sister An- gela came at his bidding; she had never hinted. to Laura what might be in store for her, lest there should be some slip. "At last, Dora!" said Cap- tain Hartland, taking the Sister's hand. "Thank you with all my heart, may God reward you for all you have done for me and mine. Where is my wife? does she know of this change?" "I have told her nothing," was the reply, know- ing that it was more fitting the pleasing intelligence           ,   a.-2    lHawthorndean. shouldscome through you. She is in the house; I wiill'sernd' her to you." Into that interview we must not gaze; it must suffice us that Laura, the discarded, forsaken wife, was restored to the inmost heart of her husband- 'to all the love of early days, made tenderer, truer, and more enduring by the fires of adversity.   CHAPTER XXXII. FINALE. HE sun rose brightly on the second day of October, the Feast of the Holy Guar- dian Angels, shining through the purple haze of autumn, and tinting with rosy fingers the scattering clouds of vapor that lingered near the horizon. The high Altar in the Church of Our Lady of Angels was decorated with rare and beautiful flowers. The usual hour of the morning Sacrifice had been a little delayed for the administering of another Sacrament. Harry Green- wood and his bride knelt in devotion before that altar, offering to God the vows they were there to make; while Captain Hartland and his restored wife bent the knee with the bridal party, and as the priest, receiving the ring firom the bridegroom, placed it upon the proper finger of the bride, Aleck Hartland, unseen, slipped the bright circle he had so long worn with a heavy heart, upon the finger of his wife, now nearer and dearer to him than ever. Mass for a newly-married pair was celebrated, Harry and Rosine still worshipping at that altar, where they- together received the Living Bread, while at the conclusion of the services, 35*            4 4   "4       tavewthorndean. Father Roberts pronounced the solemn nuptial benediction. It was a peaceful, holy scene, where the purest joys of earth-mingled with the treasured hopes of heaven, not a jarring thought, not a passing shadow even on those young hearts, here pledged to each other, and together to their dear present Lord, for all time and eternity. 'Marion had contrived to steal from her princely home with the little Lily, to witness a ceremony that recalled to her only weary, heart-saddening memories. Mr. 'Benton could not be persuaded to come to town for even this occasion; but the mother was with her beloved daughter. Colonel Hartland gave away the bride, the little Philomena, now a fine grown girl, standing as bride's-maid, while Harold had come all the way from St. Louis, as he asserted again and again, solely to do his duty as "best :man." That was a charming bridal party as they took the cars for dear Hawthorndean, not one missing, and only one with the old heart-ache clinging to her-the drooping Marion; the light-hearted, out- spoken joy, contrasted with her own desolate well- remembered bridal, followed by no nuptial bene- diction. Harold brought news, which he told privately to his mother, of the reported engagement of Horatio Leighton with some grand lady in Wash- ington. " O, Marion! what did she want with that old fool?" he inquired contemptuously, as he ended his communication. "Hush, my boy," said his mother, laying her hand reprovingly on his lips; "he is your brother."           *  '.*   Fizale.        415 Dr. HaIrtland and his father had had quite a little friendly quarrel about giving the bride away, Ned declaring that it was his right, but here the'Colonel was positive, so the-son was obliged to-submit. "I haven't given you away, Rosa," he said, as the wearied party reached the lovely home at Haw- thorndean, "and to-morrow I want you for Paradise, Sunny Nook and Purgatory. Shall I have to ask his permission?" he added, 'looking quizzically at the bridegroom. "Never," said Harry, smiling; "she is just as truly yours, only I may sometimes break in on your tete a tete." "You mean to keep that right, ha! Well, we'll circumvent him, wont we, Rosa? What does he know of the lovely places about Hawthorndean?" It was suggested by the Doctor next day in that ramble, which perhaps it is unnecessary to say was not made without Harry, that- Rosa could not possibly be spared to set up a separate establish- ment; what were two lone men like his father and himself to do? At first the husband's resolution was quite fixed, that it was only right and proper that they should make a home for themselves; :but his persistence was shaken by the earnestness and ' warmth of the Doctor and Rosa?"It would be so nice, Harry, to have the dear Colonel and Ned at our table.;" and at last he gave his consent to the pleading look of those brown eyes, and the touch of that little hand as it lay in his, to leave things as they were at present; to give up the rooms he had proposed to take till they could get a house, and suffer Rosine still to be the head of the Colo-   "6'  H-awthorndean. nel's family. Colonel Hartland had' provided very generously for his beloved daughter, but to keep her in his house!-how he longed for it, but his delicacy had forbidden him to make the request. When he heard of the decision made under the sweet skies of Sunny Nook, he was like a boy again, thanking Harry with so much emotion and simpli- city, that the young man almost blamed his own heart for the wish to have her all to himself. Dr. Hartland could not as yet be quite cordial in his manner to Laura, there was for some time a restraint between them; cold, -fnrmal politeness on his part; but at length, the quiet, shrinking course which she maintained, wore its way even into his obdurate heart. As for the restored wife, she knew no -pleasure now but Aleck's wishes, and the tiny cottage, below the lawn was a home of sweet- con- tent, made sweeter by grateful loving hearts, that had both drank deeply of the bitter cup of sorrow. The young growing parish at Hawthorndean, with its increasing numbers, afforded a field for Laura's energies, so freely employed at the Home of the Orphans, and the poor and the sick, the destitute and forsaken, found in her a friend and helper,-and she had the pleasure in time of mark- ing a growing interest in these things in her hus- band's heart. Willie, the dear blind boy, was at first a little grieved and sensitive about Mrs. Hartland coming as she did between him and the dearest love and- fondest care of the Captain, but Laura's affec- tionate nature soon won the boy to herself, and in the end: he came back to his own little room in the cottage, and was quite ash much at home there as at   Fizale.        417 his grandfather's. Philomena Nelson, or "Mina.' as she was called, had been his playmate, but she was now gone back to her brother; much to the' regret of Laura, who, though older, (now her heart was at rest,) was no graver than the sedate little girl, and they had become the fondest of friends. Dear, patient reader, you who have kindly tra- velled through so many years with me, shall I impair the romance of this story, founded on un- questionable fact, by bringing down my living heroes and heroines to this gracious year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five? or shall I leave the remainder of their -lives to your fertile imagination?? Preferring the latter, you can here close the book, leaving these few last pages for the prosaic eyes of your- Uncles and Aunts. Dear Hawthorndean! lovely, unsurpassed as ever, with, thy verdant hill-tops crowned with the rich and varied hues of autumn tide! Time, the great innovator, has wonderfully spared the -beauties of this lovely region. The village has not developed into a country town, the same undisturbed quiet lanes open their stores of beauty to the eye and to the heart of the seeker. The mighty steam-power has not dared to invade these hills, but ah, in the distant valley, ay, in the very shadow of "Paradise," and "Pur- gatory," the fire-horse darts through the embow- ered beauties of "Sunny Nook;" friendly hands sought to save -from desecration this well-beloved spot, but railrbad corporations have no souls.   "      I Hawthorndean,. Hawthorndean boasts now no hotel, all the busi- ness of the region crowding toward the valleys, -consequently the mul titudes of summer strangers from the cities, who import into our plain country homes their artificial town customs, and laugh at our rural -habits, are but just beginning to find out our snug quarters. But our early friends from the city, linked by ties of blood and friendship with the Hawthorne estate, have never forsaken lovely Haw- thorndean. In the old mansion, Philip Benton and his wife, in "gentle life's descent," wait hand in hand their summons; full of peace and calm joy, their last days their happiest. Our kind-hearted Colonel, on the retired list of his country's servants, passes his time between his two homes, equally at head-quarters in town or country. In the year of our Lord above named, on such a morning in "yellow clad autumn," our Rosine stood where she stood one well-remembered June day .long ago, when she pointed out to Mr. Greeni  wood, for the' first time, the beauties of that loved spot. Harry is by her side; they are many years older, but the fresh, kindly look that never grows old, shines from both their faces; his bearing expresses always that same deferential admiration of his wife, which says so plainly, "The heart of-her husband trusteth in her." They are prolonging the vacation from their busy town life for their Children's sake; they are now watching a party on the lawn, earnestly engaged in a game of croquet. I speak advisedly when I say "earnestly," for per- sons never in earnest elsewhere are aroused to energy here. 13eyond-the band of players, two   Finale.        419 ladies of mature age are also watching intently the nearly completed game. Down go the mallets at length, the winning party running to the veranda. A blooming young girl was the first to reach the destination, and bring the news. "There, mamma," exclaims the little Hebe, addressing Rosine, "Uncle Ned and I beat Uncle Aleck and Cousin Lily." "Yes, Isa, we did it handsomely. Come, sit on my knee;' chairs seem to be a scarce article in these quarters." At once we are carried back to the voice and manner' of our old friend, Dr. Hartland, now con- siderably past middle age, but as erect in his car- riage, and curt in his speech as erst. "I wont come if you call me Is-sy," replied the pouting young damsel, drawling out the name. "Well, Dora then; Isadora, my beloved, will you condescend to rest yourself in these arms?" Then began a tustle, and the bird was at length captured by the all-conquering Doctor; evidently very glad was the Miss -of her seat on his knee. "Has anybody told you the news, Harry?" he said, when the little lady had fixed. herself to her mind; -turning to the father and mother who watched'with delight the fond friendship ripening each day between dear old Ned and their first-born darling. "I saw by the Tiz'mes last week (I don't -suppose you read newspapers in this hermitage) that Leighton's brigade, which includes Harold's regiment, were all ordered to report in New York to be mustered out; a very sensible arrangement in the Department, as most of the soldiers belong west of the Mississippi. Father is -as pleased with   420      Hawtlorndea . the uncommon praise they shower on this brigade as if his own son were the commanding officer." "Yes," replied Mr. Greenwood, "no brigade has seen more constant, active, honorable service than this, and the Heads of the Department make special mention of General Leighton and Colonel Benton. I suppose Harold will be ready to marry now." "Yes, Dora dear," interrupted the Doctor, "you will have a real live fighting Colonel all to your- self for awhile, who will play croquet with you all day long." "O, that will be much nicer than 'old Uncle Ned!"'" cried the child, giving his hair a smart pull as he pinched her blooming cheek. "But he's going to be married," he retorted, "and will care no more for you." "Dora knows better than that," said the mother. "Uncle Harold's heart is a large one; but did you know, Ned, the marriage may be here? Father Nelson has been ordered by his physicians, as well as his superiors, to try a change of climate, and he is to bring his sister with him. His health is much broken, and papa hopes to persuade him to rest here this winter,-and we all think perhaps you may be able to help him." Doctor Hartland shook his head. "No hope for a Catholic priest," he said, "if he once begins to run down, for they will not stop work. I have had several on my hands--never succeeded in saving one." There was a grave pause for a moment, iwhen Mr. Greenwood remarked: "Then we may really have a wedding in our midst before we think of it.   Finale.       '-421 I'm sure the young couple have waited patiently for this 'cruel war' to be over." "A double wedding, possibly!" said the Doctor, shrugging his shoulders, and elevating his eye- brows as of old, when the lady in black approached the veranda with her companion. "What, are you going to be married, Uncle?" inquired the playful, teazing child, who still held her position on his knee. "No, darling," he replied; "I'm waiting for you, so make haste and grow up.'" "Indeed!" she said pertly, drawing herself up; "I guess it isn't right to marry uncles. I heard Father Roberts say cousins mustn't marry." "Little pitchers!" whispered the Doctor, in quite too serious a tone; for the small miss jumped from her seat with a great frown on her face, and ran to meet her Aunt Marion. There was a very sweet, subdued face under that widow's cap; ten years of heavy cross-bearing had- graven their lines on her cheek; she was still the elegant, grace- ful Mrs. Stapleton, with money and servants at command, but in the early stamping out of her earthly ambition by the heel of shame and sorrow, like those plants that give out sweetest odors when crushed, her better nature had revived, and she had learned through much tribulation, that there[ are nobler ends in life than the applause or envy of the world; in training her little Lily came many a lesson to her own aching heart, and in teaching her infant lips to pray, she had learned the use of 1 lis, the human soul's most powerful weapon. Past buffering was written on her brow, but more plainly a03   422      H.]awtlhorndean. ;was it written in her warm sympathy for suffering in others. She had made many dear friends, but like all true souls, the earliest were the best loved. A week at Hawthorndean with her daughter, who in spite of Dr. Hartland's prophecy of early death, had grown .into a quiet, lovely young woman, brought to Marion more of happiness than years of style and splendor in the city. Mr. Stapleton had died after a lingering illness, leaving in his will a development of hllis meanness which he had never displayed during his -life. The widow, who had so faithfully tended his days and nights of terror, and wasted her bloom in efforts to chase away the phantoms that surrounded him, was left the recipient of all his wealth with this restriction, she was -always to remain his' widow; failing this, his riches were placed in trust for his child. Such things are; but if any man wishes his name branded with odium, let him go and do likewise. Marion had now been a widow five years, and though the sadness of disappointed hope was indel- ible on her countenance, she moved with a freer air, and was more like her 'former self in cheer- fulness, than Rosine had thought was possible. Aleck Hartland did not come to the piazza with the others of the croquet party, but ;lingered among the wickets, talking with a small boy who was evidently demanding something for the letter which he held. 'At length the conference ended and Captain Hartland came forward, with the missive between his fingers,- held aloft above his head. "A telegram!" he cried "Harold will be here to- night with his friend."   Finale.       4233 "Who can he be?" innocently inquired Rosine, turning to her husband. A glance between the Doctor and Harry just then struck her as peculiar, and Aleck looked at her keenly, with -his finger on his lip. "What can they nmean?" she thought. Her question seemed for a moment to damp the whole company, save Laura and Marion; they mused away together, in soft, drony voices, appar- ently uninterested, or unnoticing-the thought that had sealed the mouths of the rest of the company. At length Mrs. Stapleton seemed to awaken to a new impression. "Did you say Harold comes to-night, and Philo- mena and Father Nelson next week? Then I sup- pose comes the wedding. I wish I might stay, but it is timne Lily was at her books again." "Marion, my child!" spoke the clear, full voice of Philip Benton, who had joined the group, "You keep Lily too closely to her studies; a month longer out of school will be a blessing to her; you know her cough is not gone-you must be careful of our delicate casket." The fair young creature rested her head on his breast, and whispered, "Dear Grandpapa." "Besides," added Mrs. Benton, mildly, yet de- cidedly, "you know, Marion, that Mina has the promise of Lily and Isadora for bridesmaids." Harold did not come that night; weary eyes kept vigil till near dawn, but there was no arrival. About sunrise the next morning, two gentlemen on foot came brushing through the woods that skirted the Hawthorne estate; the family had sunk into that heavy slumber which succeeds watching,   424.       -awzthzorndean. save Marion; her years of restless life had made her-a light sleeper, and she had gone forth for the early morning air. She was in the garden, gather- ing the few lilies and asters which the frost had spared for her mother's oratory; she was stooping over a Neapolitan violet, to find the hidden prize which betrayed itself by its precious perfume, when a soldier knelt by her side, his arms about her neck. "Why, Harold, how you frightened me! Did you drop from the skies, or come up from a lower sphere?" she exclaimed, raising herself and adjust- ing the curls which had been loosened from their hiding-place by- his embrace. "Well, I came from New York last, and they say that isn't far from the lower sphere; but here is my friend, I came near forgetting him-General Leighton." He dadrted off, as he pronounced the name, leaving Marion transfixed with astonishment; some spell rooted her to the ground, she neither raised her eyes, nor spoke, but let the flowers she had gathered drop from her fingers. "Allow me," said the General, in a low, well re- membered tone, stooping for her fallen treasures, and seeing her utter want of self-possession; so different from the old self-assured way. It would not have been possible for Marion to have reached the house at that moment; all fortitude had for- saken her, all the prowess and heroism that had -dared for so many years phantoms and apparitions, quailed before this presence, that had burst upon her like a thunderbolt. Most heartily ashamed of :herself for this exhibition of cowardice, she would ,gladly have hidden where no eye could look upon   -izale.        425 her shame. But the true heart near her, saw through all; he had borne the most bitter wrong from her, and never transferred the love he had given, to any other. Once in years long passed, he had been sorely tempted; not one would have blamed him had he yielded, but he put aside the thought and remained faithful to his early spoken vows. Honor he had won; both civil and' military, honors had been heaped upon him; reputation, but not wealth. He had often heard through others of Marion's bitter life-draught; and on the eve of his first battle he heard from a brother officer of her release fromn the dreadful slavery of an unloving, unloved wife; then he had made his own resolve, that if the end of the warfare found him living, his first thought should be for her. It was in that morning ren- contre, among the thick falling leaves and desolate remnants of the flower garden, that Marion learned the depth of the wrong she had done Horatio Leighton; and it was there she gave up wealth and all that-riches can. purchase, for one loving heart. Thus came the fulfilment of Edward Hartland's prophecy; for at the Festival of All Saints, Father Nelson, /with the permission of the parish priest, administered the sacrament of marriage to four of his "dear children," as he called them.- This was his last official act; his untiring- efforts for the flock over which the Good Shepherd had placed him, with his life of penance and fasting, had worn out a frame not the most robust. He had not strength to return to die at his post, as he had intended, after caring for his sister. On Christmas morn- 36*    , ** 426  Hazdthorndeai. ing, as the children in the far west, whom he had  gathered into the Association of the Holy Child- hood, were chanting the carols he had taught them, he fell asleep in Jesus; resting in the arms of his long-tried constant friend, Philip Benton.
