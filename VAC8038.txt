"Sing on! sing on! my mountain home, The, paths where erst I used to roam, The thundering torrent lost in foam, The snow-hill side all bathed in light, -- All,all are bursting on my sight .   - TOWARDS night, on the twelfth of March, 1775, a richly. equipped double sleigh, filled with a goodly company of well. dressed persons of the different sexes, was' seen descending from the eastern side of the Green Mountains, along what may now be considered the principal thoroughfare leading from the upper navigable portions of the Hudson to those of the Connecticut River. The progress of the travellers was not only slow, but extremely toilsome, as was plainly evinced by the appearance of the reeking and jaded horses, as they labored and floundered along the sloppy and slumping snow paths of the winter road, which was obviously now fast resolving itself into the element of which it was composed. Up to the previous evening, thebdreary reign of winter had continued wholly uninterrupted by the ad- vent of his more gentle successor in the changing rounds of the seasons; and the snowy waste which enveloped tle, earth would, that morning, have apparently withstood the rains and suns of * I   2           -THE RANGERS, months before yielding entirely to their infl ences. But during the night there had occurred one of those great and sudden transitions from cold to heat, which can only be experienced in northern climes, and which can be accountec for only on the sup- , position, that the earth, at stated intervals, rapidly gives out large quantities of its internal tfeats, or that the air becomes suddenly rarefied by some essentia- change or modification in the state of the electric fluid. The morning had been cloudless; and the rising sun, with rays no longer dimly straggling through the dense, obstructing medium of the dark months gone by, but, with the restored beams of his natural brightness, fell upon the smok- ing earth with the genial warmth of summer. A new atmosphere, indeed, seemed to have been suddenly created, so warm and bland was the whole air; while, occasionally, a breeze came over the face of tie traveller, which seemed like the breath -of a heated oven. As the day advanced, the sky gradually became overcast - a strong south wind sprung up, before whose warm puffs the drifted snow-banks seemed litera-ly to be cut down, like grass before the scythe of the mower; and, at length, from the thickening mass of cloud above, the rain began to descend in torrents to the mutely recipient earth. All this, for a while, however, produced no very visible effects on the general face of nature; for the melting snow was many hours in becoming saturated with its own and water from above. Nor had our travellers, for the greater part of the day, been much incom- moded by,the rain, or the thaw, that was in silent, but rapid progress around and beneath them; as their vehicle was a cov- ered one, and as the hard-trodden paths of the road were the last to be affected. But, during the last hour, a great change in the face of the lardscape had become apparent; and the evidence of what had been going on unseen, through the day, was now growing every moment more and more palpable. The snow along the bottom of every valley was mared by a long, dark streak, indicating the presence of the fast-collecting waters be- neath. The stifled sounds of rushing streams were heard issuing from the hidden beds of every natural rills; while the larger brooks were beginning to burst through their wintry coverings, and throw up and push on before them the rending ice and snow that obstructed their courses to the rivers below, to which they were, hurrying with increasing speed, and with seemingly growing impatience at every obstacle they met in their iWay., The road had also become so soft, that the horses sunk nearly to the flank at almost every step, and the plunging sleigh drove heavily   OR THE TORYS DAUGHTER.       3 along the plashy path. The whole mass of the now saturated and dissolving snow, indeed, though lying, that morning, more than three feet deep on a level, seemed to quiver and- move, as if on the point of flowing away in a body to the nearest channels. The company we have introduced consisted of four gentlemen and two ladies, all belonging, very evidently, to the most wealthy, and, up to that time, the most honored and influential class of society. But though all seemed to be of the same caste, yet their natural characters, as any physiognomist, at a glance, would have discovered, were, for so small a party, unusually diversified. Of the two men occdpying the front seat, both under the age of thirty, the one sitting on the right and acting as driver was tall, showily dressed, and of a haughty, aristocratic air; while his sharp features, which set out in the shape of a half-moon, the convex outline being preserved by a retreating forehead, an aquiline nose, and a chin sloping inward, combined to give him a cold, repulsive countenance, fraught with expres- sions denoting selfishness and insincerity. The other occupant of the same seat was, on the contrary, a young man of an unas- suming demeanor, shapely features, and a mild, pleasing couth tenance. The remaining two gentlemen of the party were much older, but scarcely less dissimilar in their appearance than the two just described. One of them was a gaunt, harsh-featured man, of the middle age, with an air of corresponding arrogance and assumption. The other, who was still more elderly, was a thick-set and rather portly personage, of that quiet, reserved, and somewhat haughty demeanor, which usually belongs to men of ' much self-esteem, and of an unyielding, opinionated disposition. The ladies were both young, and in" the full- bloom of maidenly beauty. Butt their native characters, like those of their male companions, seemed to be very strongly contrasted. The one seated on the left was fair, extremely fair, indeed; and her  golden locks, clustering in rich profusion around her snowy neck and temples, gave peculiar effect to the picture like' beauty of her face. But her beauty consisted of pretty features, and her coun- tenance spoke rather of the affections than of the mind, being of ' that tender, pleading cast, which is better calculated to call forth sympathy than command respect, and which showed heir to be one of those confiding, dependent persons, whose destinies are in the hands of those whom they consider their friehds, rather than in their own keeping. - Te other maiden, with an equally fine form and no less beautiful features, was still of an entirely differ- ent appearance. She, indeed, was, to the one first described,   4           THE RANGERS, what the rose, with its hardy stem, is to the lily leaning on the surrounding-herbage for its support; and though less delicately fair in mere complexion, she was yet more commandingly beautiful; for there was an expression in the bright, discrimi- nating glances of her deep hazel eyes, and 'n the commingling smile that played over the whole of her serene and benignant countenance, that told of intellects that could act independently, as well as of a heart that glowed with the kindly affections. "Father," said the last described female, addressing the eldest gentleman, for the purpose, apparently, of giving a new turn to the conversation, which had now, for some time, been lagging,- i" father, I think you promised us, on starting from Bennington this morning, not only a fair day, but a safe arrival at Westmin- ster Court-House, by sunset, did you not?" 4"Why, yes, perhaps I did," replied the person addressed; " for I know I calculated that we should get throug! by daylight." "Well, my weatherwise father, to say nothing about this storm, instead of the promised sunshine, does -he progress, made and now making, augur very brightly for the other part of the result?"  "I fear me not, Sabrey," answered the old gentleman, "though, with the road as good as when we started, we should have easily accomplished it. But who would have dreamed of a thaw sudden and powerful as this? Why, the very road before us ooks like a running river! Indeed, I think we shall do well to reach Westminster at all to-night. What say you, Mr. Peters, - will -the horses hold out to do it?" he added, addressing the young man of the repulsive look, who had charge of the team, as before mentioned. 4' They must do it, at all events, Squire Haviland," replied Peters. "Sheriff Patterson, here," he continued, glancing at the hard-featured man before described, " has particular reasons for being on the ground to-night. I must also be there, and like- wise friend Jones, if we can persuade him to forego his intended stop at Brattleborough; for, being of a military turn, we will give him the command of the forces, if he will go on immediately with us." "Thank you, Mrq Peters," replied Jones, smiling. "I do not covet the honor of g command, though I should be ready to go on and assist, if I really believed that military forces would be needed."                         , ' Military forces needed for what?" asked Haviland, in some surprise. "Why, have you not heard, Squire Haviland," said the sheriff,   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.        5 "s that threats have been thrown out, that our coming court would not be suffered to sit?" "4 Yes, something of the kind, perhaps," replied Haviland, con- temptuously; "' but I looked upon them only as the silly 'yaporings of a few disaffected creatures, who, having heard of the rebellious movements in the Bay State, have- thrown out these idle threats- with the hope of intimidating our authorities, and so prevent-the holding of a court, which they fear might bring too many of them to justice." ". So I viewed the case for a while," rejoined Patterson; " but a few days ago, I received secret information, on which I could rely, that these disorganizing rascals were actually combining, in considerable numbers, with the intention of attempting to drive us from the Court-House." "Impossible! impossible! Patterson," said the squire;-'" they, will never be so audacious as to attempt to assail the king's court." "They are making a movement for that purpose, nevertheless," returned the former; "for, in addition to the information I have named, I received a letter from Judge Chandler, just as I was, leaving my house in Brattleborough, yesterday morning, in which the judge stated, that about forty men, from Rockingham, came to him in a body, at his house in Chester, and warned him against holding the court; and had the boldness to tell him, that blood would be shed, if it was attempted, especially if the sheriff appeared with an armed posse." ', Indeed! why, I am astonished at their insolence!" exclaimed the squire. "But what did the judge tell them?" "Why the judge, you know, has an oily way of getting along with ugly customers," replied the sheriff, with a significant wink; "so he thanked them all kindly for calling on him, and gravely told them he agreed with them, that no court should be holden at this time. But, as there was one case of murder to be tried, he supposed the court must come together to dispose of that;, after which they would immediately adjourn. And promising them that lie would give the sheriff directions not to appear with any armed assistants, he dismissed them, and sat down and-wrote me an account of the affair, winding off with giving me the direc- tions he had promised, but adding in a postscript, that I was such a contrary fellow, that he doubted whether I should obey his directions; and he should not be surprised to see me there with a hundred men, each with a gun or pistol under his great-coat,t  Ha I ha I The judge is a sly one."   6           THE IRANGERS1 "One word about that case of murder, to which you have al- luded, Mr. Patterson," interposed Jones, after the jeerinfg laugh, with which the sheriff's account was received by Haviland and Peters, had subsided. '"I have heard several mysterious hints thrown out by our opponents aboutit, which seemed to imply that the prosecution of the prisoner was got up for private pure poses; and I think I have heard the name of Secretary Brush coupled with the affair. Now, who is the alleged murderer? and where and when was the crime committed?" "The fellow passes by the name of Herriot, though it is sus- pected that this is not his true name," responded the sheriff. "' The crime was committed at Albany, several years ago, when he killed, or mortally wounded, an intimate friend of Mr. Brush." "Under what circumstances?" uWhy, from what I have gathered, I should think the story might be something like this: that, some time previous to the murder, this Herriot had come to Albany, got into company above his true place, -dashed away a while in high life, gam- bled deeply, and, losing all his own money, and running up a large debt to this, and other friends of Brush, gave them his obli- gations and absconded. But coming there again, for some pur. pose, a year or two after, with a large sum of money, it was thought, which had been left or given him by a rich Spaniard, whose life he had saved, or something of the kind, those whom he owed beset him - to pay them, or play again. But he refused to" play, pretending to have become pious, and also held back about paying up his old debts. Their debts, however, they deter. mined to have, and went to him for that purpose; when an affray arose, and one of them was killed by Herriot, who escaped, and fled, it seems, to this section of the country, where he kept him- self secluded in some hut in the mountains, occasionally appear- ing abroad to preach religion and rebellion to the people, by which means he was discovered, arrested, and imprisoned in Westminster jail, where he awaits his trial at the coming terim of the court. And I presume he will be convicted and hung, unless he makes friends with Brush to intercede for a pardon, which he probably might do, if the fellow would disgorge enough of his hidden treasures to pay his debts, and cease disaffecting the people, which is treason and a hanging matter of itselfifor :which he, and fifty others in this quarter, ought, in justice, to- be dealt. with without beniefit of the clergy..--Whhat say you, 'Squie Haviland w"?  "I agree with you fully," replied the squire. But to ro-   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       1t turn to Judge, Chandler's c:mmunication: what steps-have you taken, if any, in order to sustain the court in the threatened emergency "  4"Why, just the steps that Chandler knew I should take -sent off one messenger to Brush, there on the ground at Westminster; another to Rogers, of Kent, and yet another to a trusty friend in Guilford, requesting each to be on, with a small band of reso. lute fellows; while I whipped over to Newfane myself, fixed matters there, and came round to Bennington 'to enlist David Red- ding, and a friend or two more; as I did, after I arrived, last night, though I was compelle 1 lto leave them my sleigh and horses to bring them over, which accounts for my basgging a passage with you. So, you see, that if t is beggarly rabble offer to make any disturbance, I shall be prepared to teach them the cost of attempt- ing to put down the king's court." ! "Things are getting to a strange pass among these deluded, people, that is certain. I cannot, however, yet believe them so infatuated as to take this step. But if they should, decided meas- ures should be taken- such, indeed, as-shall silence this alarmr. ing spirit at once and forever." "I hope," observed Miss Haviland, who had been a silent but attentive listener to the dialogue, "I hope no violence is really intended, either on the part of the authorities or their opponents. But what do these people complain of? There must be some cause, by which they, at least, think themselves justified in the move/ment, surely. Do they consider themselves aggrieved by any past decisions of the court?" "O there are grumblers enough, doubtless, in that respect," answered the sheriff. "-And among other things, they complain that their property is taken and sold to pay their honest debts, when money is so scarce, ttey say, that they cannot' pay their creditors in currency--just as if the court could make money for the idle knaves! But tlmat is mere pretence. They have other motives, and those, too, of a more dangerous character to the public peace."                 1 "And what may those motives be, if it be proper for me to inquire, sir?" resumed the fair questioner.  "': Why, in the first place;' replied the sheriff, 4 they have an old and inveterate grudge against New York, whose jurisdictioa they are; much predisposcd to :resist. But to this they might hae continued to demur and submit, as they halve done this side of, the lMountain, had New York adopted the rbsolves of the CIf ti nental Congress of last Dcembrf and come into the AM1Sic   8&   .     v  THE RANGERS, Association, as it is called, which has no less for its object, in reality, than the entire overthrow of all royal authority in, this country. But as our colony has nobly refused to do this, they' are now intent on committing a double treason - that of making war on New York and the king too." "Well, I should have little suspected," remarked Haviland, "that the people of this section, who have shown themselves commendably conservative, for the most part, had any intention of yielding to the mob-laws of Ethan Allen, Warner, and others, who place the laws of New York at defiance on the other side of the mountains; and much less that they would heed the re- solves of that self-constituted body of knaves, ignoramuses, and rebels, calling themselves the Continental Congress." "Are you not too severe on that body of men, father?" said Miss Haviland, lifting her expressive eye reprovingly to the face of the speaker. "I have recently read over a list of the mem- bers of the Congress; when I noticed among them the names of men, who, but a short time since, stood very high, both for learn- ing and worth, as I have often heard you say yourself. Now, what has changed the characters of these men so suddenly?" i"Why is it, Sabrey," said the old gentleman, with an air of petulance, and without deigning any direct answer to the trouble- some question,-- " why is it that you cannot take the opinion of your friends, who know so much more than you ,do about these matters, instead of raising, as I have noticed you have lately seemed inclined to do, questions which seem to imply doubts of the correctness of the measures of our gracious sovereign and his wise ministers?" "Why, father," Replied the other, with an ingenuous, but some- what abashed look, " if I have raised such questions, in relation to the quarrel between .the colonies and the mother country, I have gone on the ground that the party which has the most right on its side would, of course, have the best reasons for its measures; and as I have not always been able to perceive good reasons for all'the king's measures, I had supposed you would be proud to give them." The old gentleman, though evidently disturbed and angry at this reply, did not seem inclined to push the debate any further with his daughter. The other gentlemen, also, looked rather glum; and for many moments not a word was spoken; when the other young lady, who had not yet spoken, after glancing round on- the gentlemen in seeming expectation that those: better reasons would be given, at length ventured to remark,--   OR THE 'TORY'S DAUGHTER.        91 ', Well, for my part, it is enough for me that my friends all belong to the loyal party; and whatever might be said, I know I should always feel that they were in the right, and their opposers in the wrong." "And in that, Jane, I think you are wise," responded Jones, wih an approving smile. "The corpplaints of these disaffected people are based on mistaken notions. They are too ill informed, I fear, to appreciate the justice and necessity of the measures of out ministers, or to understand very clearly what they are quar- relling about."                  ' "Ah, that is it " warmly responded Haviland. "That is what I have always said of them. They don't understand their own rights, or what is for their own good, and should be treated ac- coIdingly. And I think some of our leading men miss it in trying  to reason-with them. Reason with them! Ridiculous! As if the co mon people could understand an argument!" I' You are perfectly right, squire," responded Peters, with eager promptness. "My own experience among the lower classes fully confirms your opinion. My business, for several years past, has brought me often in contact with them, in a certain quarter; and, I have found them not only ignorant of what properly belongs to their own rights and privileges, but jealous and obstinate to a degree that is excessively annoying." "Friend Peters probably alludes to his experience in the great republic of Guilford," said Jones, archly. "There and elsewhere," rejoined the former; " though I have seen quite enough of republicanism there, for my purpose. One year, the party outvoting their opponents, and coming into power, upsets every thing done by their predecessors. The next year the upsetters themselves get upset; and all the measures they had established are reversed for others no better; and so they go on from year to year, forever quarrelling and forever changing."- "And yet, Peters," resumed Jones, banteringly, 1 I doubt whether you have been much the loser by their quarrels." "How so, Mr. Jones'?" asked Haviland, who noticed that Peters had answered only by a significant smile. "Why, you know, Squire Haviland," replied Jones, " that I have been on to attend several of the last sessions of your court, as the agent of Secretary Fanning,* to see to his landed interests in * Edward Fanning, secretary to Governor Tryon, New York, before the revolution, obtained, by an act of favoritism from his master, a grant of 'the township of Stratton, which, in 1780, Fanning having been appoint- ed a colonel of a regiment of tories, was confiscated, and re-granted, -by   T THE RANGERS,  this quarter. Well, friend Peters, here, who has gone consider. ably into land speculations east of the mountains, you know, had brought, it seems, several suits for the possession of lands, mostly in this same Guilford; and among the rest, one for a right of land in possession of a sturdy young log-roller, whom they called Harry Woodburn, who appeared in court in his striped woollen frock, and insisted on defending his own case, as he proceeded to do with a great deal of confidence. But when he came to produce his deed for the land he contended was his'own, it was found, to his utter astonishment, to bear a later date than the one pro. duced by Peters. This seemed to settle the case against him. But he appeared to have no notion of giving up so ; and, b favor of court, the further hearing of the case was deferred a day or two, to enable him to procure, the town records, which, he con- tended, would show the priority of his deed. So he posted. back to Guilford for the purpose; but, on arriving there, found, to his dismay, that the records were nowhere to be found. One of the belligerent parties of that town, it seems, had broken into the clerk's office, stolen the records, and buried them somewhere in the ground. The fellow, therefore, had to return, and submit to a judgment against him.  Still, however, he clung to his case, and obtained a review of it, ir. expectation that the records would be found before the next court. But the poor fellow seemed doomed to disappointment. At the next court, no records were forth- coming; and though he defended his case with great zeal, he was thrown in his suit again; when he concluded, I suppose, to yield to his fate without further ado." l"Not by any means," said Peters, in a tone of raillery. "He has petitioned foi a new trial; and the question is to come on at this court." "Indeed i" exclaimed Jones, laughing. , , Well, I must con- fess I have never seen so much dogged determination exhibited in so hopeless a case. And I really could not help admiring the fellow's spirit and uncultured force of mind, as much nisapplied as, of course, I suppose it to have been. Your lawyer, Stevens, really appeared, once or twice, to be quite annoyed at his home thrusts; while lawyer Knights, or Rough-.hewn Sam, as they call him, who, either from a sly wish to see his friend Stevens both. ered, or from a real wish to help .Harry, volunteered to whisper a the legislature of Vermont, to William Williams and others. Keent, asf- terwards Londonderry, which had been granted to JamesRllogers, who has been introduced, and who became a tory officer, was also. in like manner, confisoated and re-granted, ,    '                   ' @i   OR THETORY'S DAUGHTER.      1 few suggestions inhis ear occasionally, sat by, and laughed out of his eyes, till they ran over with tears, to see a court lawyer so hard pushed bv a country bumpkin." "Pooh! you make too much of the fellow," said Peters, with assumed contempt. "Why, he is a mere obstinate boor, whose self-will and vanity led him to set up and persevere in a defence in which he knows there is neither law nor justice." "And yet, Mr. Peters," observed Miss Haviland, inquiringly, "the young man must have known that he was making great ex- pense for himself, in obtaining delays and new trials, in the hope that the lost records would be found. If he was not very confi- dent those records would have established his right, why should he have done this?" "O, that was a mere pretence about the records altering the case, doubtless," replied Peters, with the air of one wishing to  hear no more on the subject. "It may have been so," rejoined the former, doubtfully; " but I should have hardly inferred it -from Mr. Jones's description of the man and his conduct." "Nor I," interposed the other lady, playfully, but with consid- erable spirit. ' Mr. Jones has really excited my curiosity by his account of this young plough jogger. I should like to get a sight of him -shouldn't you, Sabrey?" But the latter, though evidently musing on the subject, and mentally discussing some unpleasant doubts and inferences which it seemed to present to her active mind, yet evaded the question, and turned the conversation, by directing the attention of her companion and the rest of the company to a distant object in the wild landscape, which here opened to their view. This was the tall, rugged mountain, which, rising from the eastern shore of the Connecticut, was here, through an opening in the trees, seen looming and lifting its snowy crest to the clouds, and greeting the gladdened eyes of the way-worn travellers with the silent but welcome announcement that they were now within a few miles of the great river, and in the still more immediate vicinity of their intended halting place-.the thriving little village which was then just starting into life, under the auspices of the man from whom its name was derived-- the enterprising Colonel Brattle, of Mas, sachusetts. Having now the advantage of a road, which, as it received the many concentrating paths of a thicker settlement, here began to be comparatively firm, the travellers passed rapidly. over the -de- scending grounds, and, in a short time, entered the village. As s -1f2         THE RANGERS, they were dashing along towards the village inn, at a full trot, a man, with a vehicle drawn by one horse, approaching in an intersecting road from the south, struck into the same street a short distance before them. His whole equipment was very obviously of the most simple character, - a rough board box, resting on four upright wooden pins inserted into a couple of saplings, which were bent up in front for runners -the whole making what, in New England phrase, is termed a jumper, con. stituted his sleigh. And this vehicle was drawn by a long switch. tailed young pony, whose unsteady gait, as he briskly ambled along the street, pricking up his ears and veering about at every new object by the way-side, showed him to be but imperfectly; broken. The owner of this rude contrivance for locomotion was evidently some young farmer from the neighboring country. But although his dress and mode of travelling seemed thus to characterize him, yet there was that in his personal appearance, as plain as was his homespun garb, which was calculated to com- mand at once both attention and respect. And as he now rose and stood firmly planted in his sleigh, occasionally looking back to watch the motions of the team behind him, with his long, toga- like woollen frock drawn snugly over his finely-sloping shoulders and well-expanded bust, and closely girt about at the waist by a neatly-knotted Indian belt,-while the flowing folds below streamed gracefully aside in the wind, he displayed one of those compact, shapely figures, which the old Grecian sculptors so delighted to delineate. And in addition to these advantages of figure, he possessed an extremely fine set of features, which were shown off effectively by the profusion of short, jetty locks, that curled naturally around his white temples and his bold, high forehead. "Miss McRea -Jane," said Jones, turning round to the amia- ble girl, and tapping her on the shoulder, with the confiding smile and tender playfulness of the accepted lover, as he was,- "Jane, you said, I think, that you should like to get a sight of that spunky opponent of Mr. Peters, whom we were talking of a little while since - did you not?" "O, yes, yes, to be sure I did," replied the other briskly;-" but why that question, just at this time?" "Because, if I do not greatly mistake, that man who is push- ing on before us, in yon crazy-looking establishment, is the Pelf- same young fellow. Is it not so, Peters?" "I have not noticed him particularly, nor do I care whether it is he or not," answered Peters, with an affected indifference, with which his uneasy and frowning glnces, as he kept his eye keenly fixed on the person in question, but illy comported.   OR THE TOy'JS DAUiTGHTER.       S a Well, that is the fellow - that is Harry Wodthurnt,  yoi tiay rely on it, ladies," rejoined Jones, gayly, as he faced about inii his seat.  Both young ladies now threw intent and curious glacCes for- warid on the man thus pointed out to them, till they caught, as they did the next moment, a full and fair view of his personal appearance; when they turned and looked at each other with expressions of surprise, which plainly indicated that the object of their thoughts was quite a different person from what they had been led to expect. " His dress, to be sure, is rather coarse," observed Miss Have. "and to her companion, in a low tone; " but he is no boor; nor can every one boast of-- "Here she threw a furtive glance at Peters, when she appeared to read somethiig in his countenance which caused her to suspend the involuntary comparison which was evidently passing in her mind, and to keep her eye fixed on his motions.  The arrogant persohage last named, wholly unconscious of this scrutiny, now began to incite his horses afresh, frequently applying the lash with unwonted severity, and then suddenly curbing them in, till the spirited animals became so frantic that they could scarcely be restrained from dashing off at a run. The young farmer, in the mean while, finding himself closely pressed by those behind him, without any apparent disposition on thieir part to turnr out and pass by him, now veered partly out of the road, to give the others, with the same change in their course to the opposite side, an opportunity, if they chose, of going by, as might easily have been done with safety to all concerned. s"Mr. Peters!" suddenly exclaimed Miss Haviland, in a tonhe of energetic remonstrance, at the same time catching at his arm, as if tV restrain him from some intended movement, which her watch- ful eye had detected. This appeal, however, which was rather acted than spokeni was unheeded, or came too late; for, at that instant, the chafing and maddened horses dashed furiously forward, directly oveor the exposed corner of the young man's vehicle, which, under the iron- bound feet of the fiercely-treading animals, and the heavy sleigli runners that followed, came down with a crash to the ground, leav- ing him barely time to clear himself from the wreck, by leaping forward into the snow. Startled by the noise behind him, the fright'- Fened pony made a sudden but vain effort to spring forward with the6 still connected remains of the jumper, which were, at th6e:inistahft,  confined down by the passing runners of the large sleigh; -whn, 2Li    "         THE RANGERS, snorting and wild with desperation, he reared himself upright on 'his hinder legs, and. fell over backwards, striking, with nearly the whole weight of his body, upon his doubled neck, which all saw at a glance was broken by the fall. With eyes flashing with indignation, young Woodburn bounded forward to the head of the aggressing team, boldly seized the nearest horse by his nostrils and bridle curb, and, in spite of his desperate rearing and plunging, under the rapidly applied whip of the enraged driver, soon succeeded, by daring and powerful efforts, in bringing him and his mate to a stand. "Let go there, fellow, on your peril!" shouted Peters, chok- ing with rage at his defeat in attempting to ride over and escape  his bold antagonist. 1"Not till I know what all this means, sir!" retorted Woodburn, with unflinching spirit. "Detain us if you dare, you young ruffian!" exclaimed the sheriff, protruding his harsh visage frotn one side of the sleigh. "Begone!,or I will arrest you in the king's name, sir!" "You will show your warrant for it first, Mr. Sheriff," replied the former, turning to Patterson with cool disdain. "I have nothing to do with you, sir; but I hold this horse till the outrage I have just received is atoned for, or, at least explained." "My good friend," interposed Jones, in a respectful manner, "you must not suppose we have designedly caused your disaster. Our horses, which. are high-mettled, as you see, took a sudden start, and the mischief was done before they could be turned or checked." "Now, let go that horse, will you, scoundrel?" agkin ex- claimed Peters, still chafing withi anger, but evidently disturbed and uneasy under the cold, searching looks of the other. "' Hear me first, John Peters!" replied Woodburn, with the same determined manner as before. "I care not for your abusive epithets, and have only to say of them, that they are worthy of the source from which they proceed. But you have knowingly and wickedly defrauded me of my farm; unless I obtain redress, as I little expect, from a court which seems so easily to see merits in a rich man's claim. Yes, you have defrauded me, sir, out of my hard-earned farm; and there," he continued, pointing to his gasping horse,-" there lies nearly half of all my remaining property- dead and gone! ay, and by your act, which, from signs I had previously noticed, and from the tones of that young lady's exclamation at the instant, (and God bless her for a heart which could be kind in such company,) I shall always believe   OR THE TQRY'S DAUGHTER.       15 I  was wilfully committee. And if I ean make good my suspicions, and a court of law wil not give me justice, I will have it else- where! There, sir, go," he added, relinquishing his holdlon the horse, and stepping aside, - " go! but remember I claim a future reckoning at, your hancs!"  The sleigh now passed on to the yard of the inn, where the company alighted, and soon disappeared within its doors, leaving the young man standing alone in the road, gazing after them with that moody and disqu'eted kind of countenance which usually settles on the face on tie subsidence of a strong gust of passion. ' Poor pony!" he at length muttered, sadly, as, rousing him- self, he now turned towards his petted beast, that lay dead in his rude harness, -" poor pony! - But there is no help for you now, nor for me either, I fear, as illy as I can afford to lose you. But it is not so much the loss, as the manner- the manner!" he re- peated, bitterly, as he proceeded to undo the fastenings of the tackle, with the view of removing the carcass and the broken sleigh from the road. While he was thus engaged, a number of men, most of them his townsmen, who beir g,- like himself, on their way to court, had stopped at the inn, or store, near by, where the noise of the fray had aroused them, now came hastening to the spot.  "What is all this, Harry " exclaimed the foremost, as he came up and threw a g ance of surprise and concern on the ruins before him. "Y6u can see for yourselves," was his moody reply, as others now arrived, and, with inquiring looks, gathered around him. "Yes, yes; but t ow was it done?" " "John Peters, who just drove up to the tavern, yonder, with a load of court gentry, run over me -that's all," he answered, with an air that showed his feelings to be still too much irritated to be communicative.  But the company, among whom he seemed to be a favorite, were not to be repulsed by a humor for which they appeared to  understand how to make allowance, but continued to press him with inquiries and soothing words, till their manifestations of sym-. pathy and offers of assistance had gradually won him into a more cheerful mood; when, throwing off his reserve, he thanked- themI kindly, and frankly related what he knew of the affair, the par-. ticulars of which obviously produced a deep sensation among the  listeners. All present, after hearing the recital of the facts, and  on coupling them with the well-known disposition of Peters, and his previous injuries to Woodburn, at once declared their belief         'i   Ao          Tp1E RANEBRS? that ihe aggression was intentional, and warmly espoused the cause of their outraged friend and townsman. A sort of council of war was then holden; the affair was discussed and set down as another item in the catalogue of injuries and oppressions of which the court party had been guilty. Individuals were despatched into all the nearest houses, and elsewhere, for the purpose of dis- covering what evidence might be obtained towards sustaining a prosecution. It was soon ascertained, however, that no one had seen the fracas, except the parties in interest,--all Peters's com- pany being so accounted,--and that, consequently, no hope re- mained of any legal redress. On this, some proposed measures of club-law retaliation, some recommended reprisals on the same principle, and others to force Peters, as soon as he should appear in the street, to make restitution for the loss he had occasioned. /And so great was the excitement, that had the latter then made his appearance,- which, it seemed, he was careful not to do, - it is difficult to say what might have been his reception. But contrary to the expectations of all, Woodburn, who had been thoughtfully pacing up and down the road, a little aloof from the rest, during the discussion, now came forward, and, in a firm and manly man, ner, opposed all the propositions which had been made in his behalf. "No," said he, in conclusion, " such measures will not bear thinking of. I threatened him myself with something of the kind you have proposed. But a little reflection has convinced me I was wrong; for should I take this method of obtaining redress, however richly he might deserve it at my hands, I should but be doing just what I condemn in him, and thus place myself on a level with him in his despicable conduct. No, we will let him alone, and give him all the rope he will take; and if he don't hang for his misdeeds, he will doubtless, by his conduct, aid in hastening on the time, which, from signs not to be mistaken, cannot, I think, be far distant, when a general outhreak will place him, and all like him, who have been riding over us here rough-shod for years, in a spot where he and they will need as much of our pity as they now have of our hatred and fear." "Ay, ay,"' responded several, with significant nods and looks; "that time will come, and sooner than they dream of." "And then," said one,'" it will not be with us as it was with me last fall; when, just as winter was coming on, and milk wai half our dependence for the children, our only cow was knocked Off by a winking sheriff, for eleven and threepence, to this same Peters."   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       17  4 Nor as it was with me," said another -poorly-clad man of, the crowd, " when for a debt, which, before it was sued, was only the price of a bushel of wheat I bought to keep wife and little ones from starving, mry pair of two-year-olds and seven sheep were all seized and sold under the hammer, for just enough to pay the debt and costs, to Squire Gale, the clerk of the court, who is another of those conniving big bugs, who are seen going round with the sheriff, at such times, with their pockets full of money to buy up the poor man's property for a song, though never a dollar will they lend him to redeem it with." "No, my friends," said a tall, stout, broad-chested man, with a clear, frank, and fearless countenance, who, having arrived at the spot as Woodburn began to speak, had been standing outside of the crowd, silently listening to the remrarks of the different speakers, --" no, my friends; when the time just predicted arrives, it will no longer be as it has been with any of us. We shall then, I trust, all be allowed to exercise the right which, according to my notions, we have from God --that of choosing our own rulers, who, then, would be men from among ourselves, knowing something about the wants and wishes of the people, and willing to provide for their distresses ih times like these. I have little to say about indi. vidual men, or their acts of oppression; for such men and such acts we may expect to see, so long as this accursed system of foreign rule is suffered to remain. We had better, therefore, not waste much of our ammunition on this or that tool of royalty, but save it for higher purposes. And, for .this reason, I highly ap- prove of the course that my young neighbor, Woodburn, has just taken, in his case; although, from what I have heard, I suspect it was an outrageous one." "Thank you, thank you, Colonel Carpenter," said Woodburn, coming forward and cordially offering the other his hand; "4 the approbation of a man like you more than reconciles me to the course which, I confess, cost me a hard struggle to adopt." "Ay, you were right, Harry," rejoined the former, " though a hard mratter to bear; and though I am willing this, and all such out- rages, should go in to swell the cup of our grievances, that it may the sooner overflow, yet you were right; and it was spoken, too, like a man. But let me suggest, whether you, and all present, had not better now disperse. The powers that be will soon have their dyes upon us, and I would rather not excite their jealousy, at this time, on account of certain measures we have in contem-' plation, which I will explain to you hereafter." "Your advice is good," returned Woodburn, "and I will see 2 *  that it is followed, as soon as I can find some one to dispose of ihe body of my luckless pony; for then I propose to throw the harness into some sleigh, and join such of the company here as are on foot on their way to court." "Put your harness aboard my double sleigh standing in the tavern yard yonder, Harry. And I am sorry I have too much of a load to ask you to ride yourself. But where shall I leave the harness?" '4At Greenleaf's store, at the river, if you will; for I conclude you are bound to Westminster, as well as the rest of us." "I am, and shall soon be along after you, as I wish to go through to-night, if possible, being suspicious of a flood, that may prevent me from getting there with a team, by to-morrow. Neither the rain nor thaw is over yet, if I can read prognostics. How strong and hot this south wind blows! And just cast your eye over on to West River mountain, yonder-hbow rapidly those long, ragged masses of fog are creeping up its' sides towards the summit! That sign is never failing." Woodburn's brief arrangements were soon completed; when he and his newly-encountered foot companions, each provided with a pair of rackets, or snow-shoes, - articles with which foot- travellers, when the snow was deep, often, in those times, went furnished,--took up their line of march down the road leading to the Connecticut, leaving Peters and his company, as well as all others who had teams, refresing themselves or their horses at the village inn. But, before we close this chapter, in order that the reader not versed in the antiquarian lore of those times may more clearly understand some of the allusions of the preceding pages, and also that he may not question the probability that such a com- pany as we have introduced should be thus brought together, and be thus on their way to a court so far into the interior of a new settlement, it may not be amiss here to observe, that the sale and purchase of lands in Vermont at this period constituted one of the principal matters of speculation among men of property, not only those residing here, but those residing in the neighboring colonies, and especially in that of New York ; and that the frequent con- troversies, arising out of disputed titles, made up the chief business of the court, which, on the erection of a new county by the legis, lature of New York, embracing all the south-eastern part of the Grants, and known by the name of Cumberland, had' here, sev- eral years before, been established. And it was business of this kind, And the personal, in addition to the political, interest they   OR THE TORYS DAUGHTER.        19 had in sustaining a court, the judges of which were' themselves said to be engaged in these speculations, and therefore expected to favor, as far as might be decent, their brother speculators, that led fto the journey of the present company of loyalists, consisting, as before seen, of Haviland, a large landholder of Bennington; Peters, an unconscientious speculator in the same kind of proper- ty, belonging to a noted family of tories of that name, residing in Pownal, and an adjoining town in New York; and Jones, the agent of Fanning, from the vicinity of Fort Edward; the fated Miss McRea, of sad historical memory, from the same place, having been induced to come on with her lover, at the previous solicitation of her friend, Miss Haviland, to join her, her father, and Peters, to whom she was affianced, in their proposed excur- s ion over the mountains to court.  i f                      '   20           THE RANGERS, CEAPTER    II. "Nw forced aloft, Fright bounding through the air, Moves the blear ice, and sheds a dazzling glare; The torn foundations on the surface ride, And wrecks of wir ter load the downward tide." AFTER travelling a short distance in the road, Woodburn and is companions halted, put on tl eir snow-shoes, and, turning out to the left into the woods, commenced, with the long, loping step pecu liar to the racket-shod woodsman, their march over the surface of the untrodden snow. The road just named, which formed the usual route from the village -hey had quitted to their place of des"i- nation, led first directly to the Connecticut, in an easterly direce tion, and then, turning to the north, passed up the iriver near its western banks, thus describing in its course a right angle, at the point of which, resting on -he river, stood the store of Stephen Greenleaf, the first, and, for a while, the only merchant in Ver- mont; whose buildings, with those perhaps of one or two depend- ants, constituted the then unpromising nucleus around which has since grown up the wealthy and populous village of East Brattle- borough. Such being the course of the travelled iroute, it will readily be seen, that the lain object of our foot company, in 'leaving it, was the saving of distance, to be effected by striking across this angle to some eligible point on the northern road. And they accordingly pitched their course so as to enter the roaod near its intersection with the Wantastiquet, or West River,-one of the larger tributaries of the Connecticut, - which here comes rolling down from the eastet side of the Green Mountains, and pours its rock-lashed and rapid waters into the comparatively quiet bosom of the ingulfing stream below. After a walk of about half an hour, through alternating fields and forest, they arrived, as they had calculated, at the banks of the tributary above named, where it was crossed on the ice by the winter road, which, owirg to the failure of the rude bridge near the mouth of the streamr, and the difficulty of descending the bank in its, immediate vicinity, had been broken out through the adjoining meadow and over the river at this point, which was conse0 quently a considerable distance above the ordinary place of crossing.   .  .   OR TH9 TRY'T$ RAUGHTER.        ii    On reaching this spot, it was found hat the flod, which, on the  high grounds, where we have last been taking the reader, was but little observable, had made, and was evidently still making, a most rapid progress. The rising waters had already forced them- X selves through the small but constantly widening outlets of their stong, imprisoning barriers, and were beginning to hurry along, in two dark, turbid streams, over the surface of the ice, beneath  the opposite banks, where it was still too strongly confined to the A roots and frozen earth to permit of its rising; while the uplifting mass, in the middle of the river, ,ad nearly attained the level of the surrounding meadows. And, although the main body still remained unbroken, yet the deep, dull reports that rose in quick suceessi0n to the ear from the cracking mass in every direction around, and the sharp, hissing, gurgling, sounds of the water, which wam gushing violently upwards through the fast multiplying fissures, together with the visible, tremor-like agitation that per- vaded the whole, plainly evinced that it could not long withstand the tremendous pressure of the laboring column of waters be- neath. The travellers, who were not -,o be turned back by a foot or two of water in their path over the ice, so long as the foundation remained firm, drew up a long spruce pole from a neighboring fence, and, shooting it forward through the first stream of water, passed over upon it to the uncovered ice; and then, drawing their spar-bridge to the water next the other bank, went through theosame process, till they had all reached the opposite shore un- we4 and in safety. Here they again paused to note the appearance of the disturbed eleinents; for, in addition to the threatening aspect which the river was here fast assuming, a sliga-t trembling of the ground began occasionally to be perceptible; while unusual sounds seemed to comre mingling from a distance, with the roaring of the wind and thei noise of rushing waters, as if earth, air, and water were all joining their disturbed forces for some general commotion. The water and ice are strangely agitated, it appears to me," obs rved Woodburn to his companions, as they stood looking on the scene before them. "See how like a pot the; water boils up threugh that crevice yonder! Then hear that swift, lumbering rush of the s tream beneath! The whole river, indeed, seems fail ly to groan, like some huge animal confined down by an in- suportable birden, from which it is laboring to free itself. I have noticed such appearances, I think, when the ice was on the point of breaking up; but that can hardly be the case here,at present, can it?"    ' On the point of breaking up, now?" said one of the company, in reply. "No, indeed! Why, the ice is more than three feet thick, and as sound and solid as a rock. Should it rain from this time till to-morrow noon, it won't start."         't "Well, now, I don't know about that," remarked an observant old settler, who had ,been silently regarding the different portents A 'to which we have alluded. I don't know about the ice stayving  here twenty hours, or-even one. This has been no common thaw, that we have had for the last six or eight hours, let me tell you." "And still," observed Woodburn, " 1I should not think the water high enough as yet to cause a breaking up, should you?"  "With a slow rise, and in a still time, perhaps not, Harry. But when the water is rising rapidly; as now, and especially if there is a strong wind, like this, to increase the motion, as it does either by outward pressure, or by forcing the air through the chinks in under the ice, I have always noticed that the stream acts on the ice at a much less height, and much more powerfully, than when the rise is slow and the weather calm." "Then you look upon the appearances I named as indications that such an event is soon to take place here, do you?" "I do, Harry, much sooner than you are expecting; for the signs you name  are not the only ones which 'tell- that story, as I will soon convince you all, if you will be still and listen a moment." This remark caused the company to pause and place them. selves in a listening attitude. "There," resumed the speaker, pointing up to the bold, shaggy steeps of the mountain, which we have before alluded to, and which, from the opposite side of the Connecticut, and within a ew furlongs from the spot where they now stood, rose, half con 'ealed in its " misty shroud," like some huge battlement, to the leavens - " there! do you hear that dull roar, with occasionally I Lcrashing sound, away up there among those clouds of fog near he top peaks of the mountain?" "Ay, ay, quite distinctly." ] "Well, that is an echo, which, strangely enough, we can hear then we can't the original sound, and which is made by the  I triking up there of the roar of the river above us; that of course lust be open, having already broken up and got the ice in mo-  on somewhere. But hark again! Now, don't you hear that   / lmbling noise?  Can't ydu, now, both hear and feel those quickI regular, deep, jarring sounds?" Yes, plainly- very: plainly, now--you are right. Sure   I iough, the ice in the river above us is on the move!" responded 1, with excited looks.    OR THE TORY'$ DAUGHTER.        23 "To be sure it is; and from the noise it makes, it must be comrn- g own upon us with the speed of a race-horse! Let us all to e kills, boys, where we can get a fair view of the spectacle." Tle pompany, accordingly, now all ran to gain the top of a nig iboring swell, which commanded a view of West River for a ngj distance up the stream, as vell as one of a considerable acd of the more distant Connecticut, both of which views were Istr jced, at the spot they had just left, by a point of woods and rn nthe river in the former instance, and by intervening hills th; ltter.  Ai iong the many wild and imposing exhibitions of nature, pe- lia to the mountainous regions of our northern clime, there is Ooe, perhaps, of more fearful magnificence, than that which so ne:imes presented in the breaking up of one of our large 7er by a winter flood; when the ice, in its full strength, enor- 3u thickness, and rock-like solidity, is rent asunder, with loud, sng explosions, and hurled up into ragged mountains, and grn' oward before the raging to rent with inconceivable force d igitful velocity, spredding devastation along the banks in cCurse, and sweeping away the strongest fabrics of human weE which stand opposed to its progress, like the feeble weeds it cisappear from the path of a tornado. Such a spectacle, as they reached their proposed stand, now rston the view of the astonished travellers. As far as the eye lid reach upwards along the windings of the stream, the whole aniel was filled with the mighty mass of ice, driving down maIs ;hem with fearful rapidity, and tumbling, crashing, grind. , ad forcing its way, as it came, with collisions that shook the ro ind'ng forest, and with the din and tumult of an army of Iri ts rushing together in battle. Here, tall trees on the bank re eaten down and overwhelmed, or, wrenched off at the roots I tl rown upwards, were whirled lalong on the top of the rush- v lume, like feathers on the tossing wave. There, the chang-I mss was seen swelling up into mountain-like elevations, to o  ward a while, and, then gradually sinking away, be sue. deI by another in another form; while, with resistless front, hole immense moving body drove steadily on, ploughing rind'ng its way into the unbroken sheet of ice before it, ich burst, divided, and was borne down beneath the boiling Id, r hurled upwards into the air, with a noise sometimes em ling the sounds of exploding muskets, and sometimes the sh f falling towers. iuthe noise of another and similar commotion, in an opposite   24          - THE RANGERS, directioni, now attracted their attention. They turned, and their eyes wur6e greeted with a scene, Which, though less startling from its distance, yet even surpassed, in picturesque grandeur, the one they had just been witnessing. Through the whole visible reach of the Connecticut, at long, white, glittering column of ice, with its ridgy and bristling top towering high above the adjacent banks, was sweeping by and onward, like the serried lines of an army advanciiring to; the chlarge; while the broad valley around, even badk to the summits of the far-off hills, was resounding with the deafening din that rose from the extended line of the booming avalanche, with thie deep rumblings of an earthquake mingled with the tumultuous loar of an approaching tempest. The attention of thie company, however, was now drawn from this magnificent display of the power of the elements, by an object of more immjediate interest to their feelings. This was an open double sleigh, approaching, on the opposite side of the river, towairds the pltco at which they had just crossed over, in the manner we have described;  The mountain mass of ice that, was still forcing its way down the river before them, with increas- ing impetus, was now within three hundred yards of the passt to which those in the sleigh 'were hastening, with the evident design of crossing. And though the latter, owing to a point of woods that intervened at a bend in the stream a short distance above, could not see the coming ice, yet they seemed aware of its dangerous proximity ; for, as they now drove down to the edge of the water, they paused, and a large man, who appeared to have control of the team, rose to his feet, and with words that could not be distinguished in the 'oaring of the wind and the noise from the scene above, "made an appealing gesture, which was readily understood by our foot travellers as an inquiry whether-the team would have time to cross before the ice reached the spot. "' It is Colonel Carpenter and his cobrrnpany," said Woodburn. "He will have no time to spare, but enough, I think, if he in- stantly improves it, to get safely overi. He has smart horsesi and is anxious to be on this side of the river. Let him come." Accordingly, they returned him encouraging gestures, which being seen and understood by him, he instantly whipped up his horses, and, forcing :hem on to the ice, soon effiected his passage in safety, and drove rapidly down i the road, leading along thb northern bank of the stream to the Connecticut, the object of his speed being obviously to keep forward of the icy flood, by Which his progress might otherwise be soon obstructed. "Thei e"' resumed Woodburn, breaking the silence with which   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER. he End his companions had been witnessing the rather hazardous pas! gq of their friends,-" there, the colonel is well over; but his Its he last sleigh to cross this year, unless it be drawi by win ed horses." "I1Well, winged, or not winged, there is another, it seems, about to  ake the attempt," said one of the company, pointing across the iver, where a covered double sleigh, with showy equipage, was dashing at full speed down the road towards the stream. ! It is a hostile craft!" "Peters and his gang!"  o We owe them no favors!" "Let the enemy take care of themselves!" were the exclamations which burst from -the recently-incensed group, as all eyes were now turned to the spot. "No- .! no!" exclaimed Woodburn, with looks of the most lively concern. Be they foes or friends, they must not be suf. fered toenteruponthatriver. Why, the breaking ice has already nearly reached the bend, and unless it stops there, that path across the stream, within five minutes, will be as traceless as the oce n! Run down to the balk, and hail them!" he contin. ued, turning to those around him. "I fear they would not listen to me. Will no one go to warn them against an attempt which must prove their destruction?" he added, reproachfully glancing around Lim. "Shall we interfere unasked?" said one, who was smarting under a sense of former injuries; "9 ay, and interfere, too, to save such a man as Peters that he may go on robbing us of our farms?" "And save such a man as Sheriff Patterson, also, that he may hang the innocent and pious Herriot " said another, bitterly. And save them all, hat they may keep up the court which will soon hang or rob the wfole of us " added a third, in the same ' o, wrong--wickedly wrong! and, if no one will go, I must," cried Woodburn, turnin hastily from the spot, and making his mway dwn the hill towards the river with all the speed he was A few seconds sufficed to bring him to the edge of the stream when, in a voice that rose above the roar Of the wind and waters around, he called on Peters, who was already urging his reluctant and snorting horses dow the opposite bank rnto the water, warned im ox me situanon ot teice, and begged him, as he valued the lives of his friends, to d ist from his perilous attempt. "Dco you think to  ghten me " shouted Peters, Who, pe. ceiving the speaker to his despised opponent, became sus ip OP .nents be ame         ..spi!- I               I    26          THE RANGERS  pious, as the latter had feared, that the warning was but a ruse to prevent him from going on that night -' do you think to ighten ine back, liar, when a heavy team has just passed safely over before my eyes?"  And, in defiance of the timely caution he had received, and the warning sounds, of which his senses might have apprised him, had he paused a moment to listen, he furiously applied the whip, and plunged madly through the water towards the middle ice. But as rapidly as he drove, the team hadi not passed over more than one third of the distance across, before he and all with him became fully aware of the fearful peril they had so recklessly incurred; for, at this critical monent, with awful brunt, the mountain wave of icy ruins came rolling round the screening point into full view, and not fifty yards above them. A cry of alarm at once burst from every occupant of the menaced vehi- cle; and Peters, no less frightened than the rest, suddenly checked the horses, with the half formed design of turning and attempting to regain the shore he had just left. .But on glancing roand, he beheld, to his dismay, the ice burst upward from its winter moor- ings along the shore, leaving between them and the bank a dark chasm bf whirling waters, over wlich it were madness :o think of repassing. At that instant, witl a deep and startling report, the'broad sheet of ice confining the agitated river burst asunder, parted, and was afloat in a hundred pieces around them. Another piercing cry of terror and distress issued from the devotee sleigh; and Miss Haviland, with an involntaTy impulse at the fearful shock, leaped out on to the large cfke ifl ice on which the sleigh and horses were resting. She seemed instantly to perceive her error; but before she could regain the sleigh, or even be caught by the extended hands of her friends, the frightened horses made a sudden and desperate lunge forwards and, with a speed that could neither be checked nor controlled, dashed onward over the dissevering mass, leaping from piece to piece of their sinking support, and each in turn falling in, to be drawn out by his mate, till they reached the shore, and rushed furiously up the lank, be- yond the sweep of the dreadful torrent :rom which they had so miraculously escaped. "O God of heaven, have mercy on my daughter!" exclaimed Haviland, in a piteous burst of anguish, as he sprang out of the sleigh among the company, who, with horror-stricken looks, stood on the bank mutely gazing on the fast receding form of -he luck- less maiden, thus left behind, to be borne away, in al human probability, to speedy destruction.   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       27 For a moiment no one stirred or spoke, all standing amazed, and seemingly paralyzed at the thought of her awful situation, having no hope of her rescue, and expecting every instant to see her crushed, or ingulfed among the ice that was wildly heaving and tumbling on every side around her. But fortunately for her, the broad, sd'id block, on which she had alighted, and on which she continued still to retain ler stand, was, by the sub- merged and rising masses beneath, gradually and evenly forced upwards to the top :f the column, with which it was moving swiftly down the current. And there she stood, like a marble statue on its pedesta-, sculptured for some image of woe, her bonnet thrown back ftrom her blanched features, and her loosened hair streaming wildly in the wind; while one hand was extended doubtfully towards tfie shore, and the other lifted imploringly to heaven, as if in supplication for that aid from above, which ; she now scarcely ho'ed to receive from her friends below. "O  Sabrey, Sabrey! must you indeed perish?" at length burst convulsively from Miss McRea, in the most touching accents of distress. "Is there no help? Can no one save her?" added the ago- nized father. "Yes, save her--save her!" exclaimed Peters, now eagerly addressing the men he affected so to despise. "Can't some of you get on to the ice there, and bring her off? Five guineas to the man who will do it; yes, ten! Quick! run, run, or you'll be too late," he added, turning, from one to another, without offering to start himself. Throwing a look of silent scorn on his contemptible foe, Wood- burn, having been anxiously casting about him in thought for some means of rescuing the ill-fated girl from her impending doom, now, with the air of one acting only on his own responsibility, hastily called on his companions to follow him, and led the way, with rapid strides, down along the banks of the stream, as near the main  channel as the water and ice, already bursting over the banks into the road, would permit. But although he could easily keep abreast of the fair object of his anxiety, of whom he occasionally ob- tained such glimpses through the brushwood here lining the banks as to show him that she still retained her footing on the same block of ice, which still continued to be borne on with the sur- rounding mass, yet he could perceive no way of reaching her - no earthly means by which she could be Snatched from the terri- ble doom that seemed so certainly to await her; for along the whole extent of the moving ice, and even/many rods in advance   6388        THE RANGERS, of it, the water, dammed up, and forced from the choked chan- nel, was gushing over the banks, and slveeping dowr. by their sides in a stream that nothing could withstand. And, -o add to the almost utter hopelessness with which he was compelled to view her situation, he now soon began to be admonished that she was immediately threatened by a danger from which she had thus far been so providentially preserved--that of being crushed or swallowed up at once in the broken ice. He could perceive, from the increasing commotion of the ice around her, that her hitherto level and unbroken support was growing every morrent more insecure and uncertain. And as it rose and fell, or was pitched forward and thrown up aslant, in the changing volume, he could plainly hear her piteous shrieks, and see her flying from side to side of the plunging body, to avoid being nurled into th frightful chasms which were continually yawning to receive her. 1"Lost! -lost!" he uttered with a sigh; " no earthly aid can now avail her. But stay! stay!" he continued, as his eye fell on the :two-r, three remaining beams or string-pieces of the old bridge still extended across the river a short; distance below. "If she reaches that place alive, and I can but gain the spot in time, I may yet save her. O Heaven, help me to the speei and the means of rescuing her from this dreadful death!" And calling loudly to his companions, whom he had already outstripped, to come on, he now set forward, with all possible speed, f'or the place which afforded the last chance for the poor girl's rescuei The babnks of the river, at the point which it was now his object to gain, were so much more elevated than those above, that He had little fear of finding the path leading on tothe bridge obstructed by the water. And it had glanced through his mind, as he descried this forgotten spot, and saw the remains of the bridge still standing, that the maiden might here be'assisted to escape on to the bank, or be drawn up by a cord, or some other implement, to the top of the bridge, which, being high above the ordinary level of the water, would not probably be swent away by the ice, at least not till that part of it on which she was situated should have passed under it. There was an occupied log-house standing bu: a short distance from the place, and the owner, as Woodburn drew near, was, luckily, just making his appearance at the door. "A rope, a rope! be ready with -a rope," shouted Woodburn, pointing to -he scene of trouble, as soon as he could make him- self understood by the wondering settler. The man, after a hurried glance from the speaker to the indi-       ,                     .   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.        9 cated scene, and thence to the bridge below, during which he seemed to comprehend the nature of the emergency, instantly disappeared within the door. In another moment Woodburn came up, and burst into the house, where he found the settler and his wife eagerly running out the rope of their bedstead,which had been hastily stripped of the bed and clothing, and the fastenings cut, for the purpose. The instant the rope was dsengaged, it was seized by the young man, who, bidding the other to follow, rushed out of the house, and bounded forward to the bridge, which they both reached just as the unbroken ice was here be- ginning to quake and move from the impulse of the vast body above, which, now scarcely fifty paces distant, was driving down, with deafening crash, towards them. : "Thank Heaven, she yet lives, and is nearing us!" exclaimed Woodburn, as he rall out on to the partially covered beams of the : bridge, where he could obtain a clear view of the channel above. She is there, hedged in, though as yet riding securely in the midst of that hideous jam, but, if not drawn up here, will be the next moment lost omong the spreading mass, as it -is disgorged into the Conn;ecticlut here below." "Shall we throw down an end of the rope for her to catch " said the settler, hastening to Woodburn's side. "I dare not risk her strength to hold on to it; I must go down myself," said Woodburn, hurriedly knotting the two ends of the cord round his body. "Now stan  by me, my friend. Brace yourself back firmly on this string-piece; let me down, and the instant I have secured her in my arms, draw us both up together." I  can let you down; but to draw you both up, replied. the other, hesitating at the thought of the-hazardous attempt OU must try i- " eagerly interrupted the intrepid young man. My friends  will be here in a moment to aid you. There she comes! be ready! Now!"' Accordingly, sliding over the edge of the bridge, Woodburn was gradually let down by the strong and steady hands of the settler till he was swinging in the air, on a level with that part of the approaching mass on which stood the half-senseless object of his perilous adventure :. The foremost of the broken ice was now sweeping swiftly 5y, just beneath his feet.

And now she comes - she is there! She is caught in the eager grasp of the brave youth; and, the next 'nstant, by j the giant effort of the strong man above them, they are together drawn up within a few feet of the bending and tottering bridge. But with all his desperate exertions, he can raise them no higher;  -and there they hang suspended over the dark abyss of whirling  waters that 'ad opened in the disrupturing mass beneath, at the X instant, as if to receive them; while a mountain billow of ice, ! that must overwhelm them with certain destruction, is rolling ! down, with angry roar, within a few rods of th9 spot. A groan ! of despair burst from the exhausted man at te rope; and his 1 grasp was about to give way.             -  ! ( Hold on there, an instant! one instant longer!" cried a loud j voice on the right, where,a tall, muscular form was seen bound-  ing forward to the spot. t"Quick, Colonel Carpenter! quick! O, for God's sake, quick!" exclaimed the settler, throwing an anguished and beseeching glance over his shoulder towards the other.         s The next instant, the powerful frame of the new-comer was bending over the grasped rope; and, in another, both preservers and preserved were on the bridge, from which they had barely  time to escape, before it was swept away, with a loud crash, and borne off on the top of the mighty torrent. They were met on . the bank by the companions of Woodburn, land the friends of the rescued maiden, who, came promiscuously running to the spot;  when loud and long were the gushing acclamations of joy and gratitude that rang wildly up to heaven at the unexpected deliv- ;erance.

THE village of Westminster yields, perhaps, in the tranquil Lnd picturesque beauty of its location, to few'others in New Eng. and. In addition to the advantage of a situation along the banks f that magnificent river, of which our earliest epic poet, Barlow, a his liquid numbers, has sung, "No watery glades through richer valleys shine, Nor drinks the sea a lovelier wave than thine," t stands upon an elevated plain, that could scarcely have been lade more level had it been smoothed and evened, by the instrum renits of art, to --fit it for the arena of some vast amphitheatre, rhich the place, with the aid of a little fancy, may be very easily iought to resemble; for, from the principal street, which is early a mile in extent, broad and beautiful fields sweep away in very direction, till they meet, in the distance, that crescent-like hain of hills, by which, with the river, the place is enclosed.' It was probably this natural beauty of the place, together with  s proximity to the old fort at Walpole, at which a military estib-. shment was once maintained by the government of New Hamp- fire for the protection of its frontier, that led to the early set-  ement and rapid growth of this charming spot, which, having sen entered by the pioneers as far back as 1741, continued so to icrease and prosper, though on the edge of a wilderness un- roken, for many years, for hundreds of miles on the north, that,  t the opening of the American revolution, it was the most popu- us ard best built village in Vermont. This place, at the period chosen for the beginning of our tale, had been, for several years, the seat of justice for all the south.

This was a spacious square edifice, conspicuously located, and of very respectable architecture for  the times. The village, also, contained a meeting-house, school- house, and the usual proportion of stores and taverns. The whole j place, indeed, had now nearly -assed into the second stage of existence, in American villages, when the pioneer log-houses have given place-to the more aiiy and elegant framed buildings; ana, compared with other towns, which, in this new settlement, were then just emerging from the wi derness, it wore quite an ancient appearance. Among the most commodious and handsome of the many respectable dwellings which had here been erected, was that of Crean Brush, Esquire, colonial deputy secretary of New York, and also an active membekr of the legislature of that colony for this part of her claimed territory. This house, at the sessions of the courts, especially, was the fashionable place of resort for what was termed the cour; palrty gentry, and other distinguished persons from abroad. To the interior of this well-furnished and affectedly aristocratic establishment, we will now repair, in order to resume the thread of our narrative. In an upper chamber of the house, at a late hour of the same evening on which occurred the exciting scenes described in the preceding pages, sat the two young ladies, to whom the reader has already been introduced, silently indulging in their different reveries before an open fi -e. They had safely arrived in town, about an hour before, wit all their company, except Jones, who had, been left at Brattlebor ugh; and having been consigned to the family of this mansion, 'ith whom they had formed a previous acquaintance at Albany, Where Brush, the greater part of the year, resided, and where both of the young ladies were educated, they had taken'some refreshment, and retired to the apartment prepared for their reception. The demeanor of these fair com- panions, always widely different, was particularly so at the present moment. Miss Haviland, with her chin gracefully resting on one folded hand, and her calm and beautiful, but now deeply-clouded i brow, shaded by the white,taper fingers of the other, was ab- stractedly gazing into the glowing coals on the hearth before her, whie- the gentle, but less reflective McRea, with a countenance; disturbed only by the passing emotions of sympathy that occasion- ally flitted over it, as- shel glanced' at the- downcast face of :her j friend, sat quietly preparing for bed, by removing her ornaments, A and adjusting those long, golden tresses, with which, in after  tinmes, her memory was destined to become associated, in the '   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.      83 8 minds of tearful thousands, while reading the melancholy history ' her tragic fate. "Come, Sabrey," at 'length said the latter, soothingly, "come, leer up. I,cannot bear to see you so dejected. I would- not rood over that frightful scene any longer, but, feeling grateful id happy at my escape, would dismiss it as soon as possible from y mind." "I am, Jane," responded the other, partially rousing herself om her reverie;"I am both grateful and happy at my provi. intial escape. But you are mistaken in supposing it is that scene hich disquiets me to-night." "Indeed!" replied the former, with a look of mingled surprise d curiosity. "Why, I have been attributing your dejection and sence of mind, this evening, to that cause alone. What elsei n have occurred to disturb your thoughts to-night, let me "Jane, in confidence, I will tell you," replied Miss Haviland, )king the other in the face, and speaking in a low, serious tone. it is the discovery which I have made, or at least think I have, s 'day, made, respecting the true character of one who shouldi mmand, in the relation I stand with him, my entire esteem." "Mr. Peters? Though of course it is he to whom you allude. t what new trait have you discovered in him, to-day, that leads u to distrust his character . "' "What I wish I had not; what I still hope I may be deceived ; but what, nevertheless, forces itself upon my mind, in spite of my endeavors to resist it. You recollect Mr. Jones's account thel lawsuit, in which Mr. Peters succeeded in obtaining the - m of this Mr. Woodburn, whose gallant conduct we have .all 3 afternoon witnessed?" ' Yes, certainly."  ' Well, did you think that story, when rightly viewed, was very  ditable to Mr. Peters?                - ' I am not sure I understood the case sufficiently to judge; did 'Well enough, Jane, with the significant winks that passed ween Peters and the sheriff, to convince me that an unjust   : aiage had been taken.  But perhaps I could have been  ught to believe myself mistaken in this conclusion, had I seen hing else to confirm it, and lower him still more in my What else did you see? An extibition of malice, Jane, which astonished as much as  f   34          THE RANGERS,             i  it pained me. That pretended accident, in running over Wood-  burn, was designed - ay, coolly designed." : "Why, Sabrey Havilahd! how can you talk, how can you  believe, so aoout one whose betrothing ring is now on your fin- ger?" S "It is indeed painful to do so; but truth compels me." "Might you not have been mistaken?" i; No; I saw the whole movement. I'had been watching him  some time, and I noticed how he preparec those fiery horses of his for a sudden spring, and saw the look of malicious exultation accompanying the final act. A nd even now, I shudder to think what guilt he might have inc rred! Even as i; resulted, only in the destruction of property, how can I help being shocked at the dis- covery of a secret disposition which could have prompted such a deed? O, how different has been the conduct of him who has thus been made the victim of his misusage!" ' Different! Why, what has he done? I was not aware " ' True, I am reminded that I have not told you. That loqua- cious landlady, where we stopped to dine, told me, as we were coming away, that there had been a great excitement among the people in the street, about the outrage; and that Peters would certainly have been mobbed, if Woodburn had not interfered and prevented it."  "Indeed! I should have hardly'expected so much magnanimity : in one of his class. It was truly a noble return for the injuries he had received from Peters." "Ay, and by this last] act of saving my life, he has still more nobly revenged himself paon Peters, and upon us all." "Assisted ;o save you, I conclude you n-ean ; for I heard Pe- ters tell your father, that it was the settler w\bo lived in the house near by, and Colonel Carpenter, who finally rescued you." Did he tell my father that story, without mentioning Wood- burn?" asked Miss Haviland, with a look of mingled surprise and displeasure.                       "Yes, as he came ba;k to meet us with the news, while we ! were getting round with the sleigh to the spot." ^     "Well, my father sha I know the truth f the case; and Mr. i Woodburn, though he die not boast of his services, nor even stay K to give me an opportun ty to thank him ibr what he had done, shall also know that we are not insensible to his gallant conduct; for, whatever they may say, Jane, I am indebted to him for my life.

O, why could it not have been, as I have, ten said to myself during our cheerless ride this evening, - why uld it not have been Peters, to perform all that I have this day en in that poor, despised, and persecuted young man?" "Why, Mr. Peters certainly appeared muiuch alarmed, and anx-u is that something should be done to save you," replied Miss :Rea, after a thoughtful pause, produced by the words and fer- I manner of her companion. "I Then why did he leave it to another to save me?" responded s former, severely.                      * t That I do not know, certainly," replied the other; (" but he once bestirred himself, and I heard him offer five guineas, and hink he doubled the price the next moment, to any one who uld go on to the ice and bring you off.'"

O, no, I dare say; nor did he do any thing, as I can learn,; )ugh the whole affair, except attempt to deprive Woodburn ofi credit he had gained. Jane," she continued, with softened e, "what would you have thought, had you been in my situa. i, and your lover had acted such a part?"  'I should have thought--I don't know what I should have ught,' replied the other, with a feeling which showed how  :kly the appeal had taken effect.

"Low, Jane, low" said the former, reprovingly. "Was it low to overlook -so easily the injury and affront e had received from i Peters, and then return good for evil? Andwas itlow torescue  me from the raging flood, by exertions and risk oflifewhich X would have done credit to the first hero in .he land . O, no, not that; I did not mean that; f r hisconduct has been generous an noble indeedo; and from the first, when I heard Mr.  Jones's account of him, I was disposed to think highly of the dman, for one in his situation of life. I only meant that he did : not belong to our party, but was one of the lower classes of society."  "It is true he may not belong to our party, Jane; but how much should that weigh in the argument? Perhaps at this very hour, two thirds of the American people would count it as weight in the other part of the balance. And even I, trained as I have been by and among the highest toned loya'ists, wish I could help e  doubting that our party is the only one that has right and reason on its side And as to the claim of belonging to what is calledi, the first society, I can only saj that I wish many, who are allowed .. that claim among us, were as worthy of the place as I think  Woodburn is. I have always loved Justice for her beautiful self, ; and hated her opposite; and I never could see how those who are guided by her and the kindred virtues, could be accounted low, or how, or why, those who lack these qualities could claim to be called high. Is it any wonder then, ane, that I should feel troubled and distressed at discoveries which, in my mind, reverse the situation that my friends assign to the two individuals of whom we have been speaking?" "O, you are too much of 'a philosopher for me in all that," replied Jane.

' O, I will not, Sabrey," warmly returned the kind-hearted le. "  I did not intend it. Forgive me, do; and we will dismiss subject for something which will give us pleasanter dreams, I then, as you say, go to rest and enjoy them."^ Leaving these fair friends to their slumbers, disquieted or eetened by the various visions which the incidents of the day I been calculated to excite in the bosom of each, we will now ,air to a lower apartment of the house, to note the doings of a ect band of court dignitaries there assembled, for a purpose icerning which a spectator, at the first glance, might, from the )earances, be at a loss to decide whether it was one of revelry secret consultation, so much did it partake of the character o-f h.                     -1 Around a long table, well furnished with winfe and glasses, sat select company of gentlemen, whose dress and deportment loted them to be persons of the first consequence. And such, eed, may be said to have been the fadt, till the present time; the party embraced the -judges and bfficers of the court, and :h of the most stanch and influential of their supporters as ild be convened for a special consultation, which, it was cons-' ered, the portents of the times demanded. Here was the aris-1 ratic and haughty Brush, the host, and leading spirit of the Aty, with his florid face, cracking his jokes and ridiculing " the )rish settlers," in which he was sure to find a ready response the boisterous laugh of Peters and other young supporters of' court and loyal party. Here, too, sat the fiery and profane le, the clerk of the court, with his thin, angular features, and bidding brow, occasionally exploding with his short, bitter, king laugh, as, with many an oath, he dealt out anticipated igeance on all those who should dare cross the path of the iblished authorities. And here also was Chandler, the chief [ge of the court, with his plausible manners, affectedly sincere k, and deferential smile, as he exchanged the iwhisper and aning glance' with his colleague, Judge gabin, a stern, re' ved, and bigoted loyalist, or as he nodded approbation to the 4   g38  ;THE RANGERS, remarks, whatever they might be, of those around him. These,  with Stearns, a tory lawyer of some note, Rogers, a tory land. holder, Haviland, and a few others, all leading and trusty sup- porters of - the court party, constituted the company, or rather the cabinet council, here convened, all of whom, as appeared by the  entire freedom of their remarks, were fully in each other's con- fidence  There was one person in the room, however; who had no  thought or feeling in common with the rest of those present, but  who did not appear to be deemed by them of sufficient conse-  quence to be interrogated in relation to his opinions, or of sufi-  cient capacity to comprehend what was said in his presence, at  least not to any degree which might render it unsafe that he i should hear the discussion so unreservedly going forward. This person, who was acting in the capacity of waiter to the company,  being under a temporary engagement to the master of the house, to serve him in such work as might be wanted about the house ^ and stables, was a youth, of perhaps eighteen, of quite an ordi- nary, and even singular appearance. His figure was low and  slight, and he was made to appear the more diminutive, perhaps,  by his dress, which consisted of short trousers, a long, coarse  jacket, and a flat woollen cap, drawn down to the eyebrow s. His, : hair, hanging, in lank locks, to his shoulders, was light and sandy, and his face was deeply freckled; while a pair of long, falling  eyelashes contributed to add still further to the peculiarity of his g looks, and to give his countenance, with those who did not note : the keen, bright orbs that occasionally peeped from their usually impenetrable coverts, a sleepy and listless appearance. He now i sat on the top of a high wood-box, placed near one corner of the  chimney, with his legs dangling over one end of the box, and his  head drooping sluggishy towards the fire, apparently as uncon- ' scious of what was said and done in the room, as the little black i- dog that lay sleeping on the floor beneath his feet. "Here, Bart," exclaimed Brush, as the company, having dropped the discussion of all weighty matters, were now briskly circulating the bottle, and beginning to give way to noisy merri- ment-" here, Bart, you sleepy devil, come and snuff these can- dies. Our chap here," he continued, winking archly to those around him -" our chap Bart, or Barty Burt, to give the whole of his euphonious name, gentlemen, may be considered an excellent specimen of the rebel party, who talk so wisely about self-gov- ernment, sitting under one's own vine and fig-tree, and all that sort of thing; for, in the first place, he has a great deal of wis-   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       39 rn, handy to be got at, it- a11 lying in his face. -And then he is much for self-government that no one can govern him in iy thing. Then again, as to the idea of sitting under a fig-tree, hink it is one that Bart would most naturally entertain; for had- a tree to sit under, be it fig or bass-wood, and enough to eat, would sit there till he was gray, before he would think of iving."  "Not badly drawn, that similitude," said Stearns, after the rst of laughter, by which these remarks were greeted, had a tle subsided; C but methin s I see a flaw therein, friend Brush-: u said our young republian's wisdom, alias ideas, all lay in face; and then, in the natter of the fig-tree, you go on to imate he has one distinct idea in his head, thereby lessening 3 force and exactness of the comparison, as I think you will "I crave pardon, gentlemen," cried the secretary; "I should ve qualified; for, really, I have several times seriously sus- sted Bart to have ideas, or, at least, one whole idea of his' i rn; and if you think that is too much to allow the individuals the party generally, with whom I have compared him, why, 3n I must knock uider, tha-'s all."    : "You are down! iyou are down, then, Brush!" shouted sev- l, with another uproarious burst of laughter. Bart, the chief butt of this ridicule, in the mean while, was mov- : quietly about the room in performance of his bidden tasks, :hout appearing to notice a word that was uttered; and but for ertain rapid twinkling that might have been seen in his eyes, ich, as he deliberately returned to his seat in the corner, were ,ned to an unusual extent, one would have lsupposed him utterly ensible to all the taunts and jeering laughter of which he had i s publicly been made the victim.   Ah! Patterson, here you are then, at laIt," exclaimed Gales the former, with a disturbed and angry countenance, now ne pushing his way into the midst of t he company. "We. re done nothing but drink and joke s nce you went out, rcely;- at all events, we have concluded ,n nothing, except to it and' learn the result of vour discoveri s: so now for your ort."  . 'Ay, ay, Mr. Sheriff," responded Brush. "But stay, take ath, and a glass of this glorious old Madeira, first, There I! v tell us how the land lies abroad to-night.1" : It lies but little to my liking," growled the sheriff, with an oath.'

It beats Belzebub! --- " "Our witnesses," quickly interposed Judge Chandler, bowing with a significant smile and cautionary wink, while he threw a sidelong glance towards Bart, whom the wary eye of the judge had detected in slightly changing his position, so as to bring his ear more directly towards the speakers--"our witnesses and quarrelling suitors in court you mean, of course?" Why, yes - yes, your honor - if you think that necessary," replied Patterson, following the direction of the other's glance, and then looking inquiringly at Brush, as if to ask whether there was any danger to be apprehended from talking before the servant. "Pooh! -nonsense!" said Brush, readily understanding the mute appeal. "Nonsense! You could not make him compre- hend what we are talking about in six weeks, if you should do your prettiest. Why, the fellow has not two ideas above a jackass! - so talk out." "Well, then," resumed the sheriff, in a lower tone, "I have satisfied myself that the rebels are plotting like so many ,Satans, and are in earnest about carrying their threat into execution. Now, the question is, what shall be done- yield the point and submit to be turned out of the Court House to-morrow, as if we . were a pack of unruly boys, or what?" "Yield!" fiercely exclaimed Gale--" not till my pistol bullets have drank the heart's blood of the d-- d rascals, first." "Ay, Gale," responded Brush, " that would be well enough, buat for one small difficulty, which is, that these demi-savages un- derstand quite as much of that kind of play as we do; and so long as they outnumber us so greatly, the fun of doing what you would propose might be less than talking about it. Let us have Chan- dler's opinion. What course is it best to take, judge?" "' Temporize!" replied the latter, in a low, emphatic tone, and with a look of peculiar significance - " temporize till " '"Till we can help ourselves," said Patterson, taking up the sentence where the other left it, or rather finishing in words what had been expressed by looks. "That's just my notion," remarked Stearns. "Let them see and be assured that we are for peace, and want nothing but what is right; all of which may be said truly. And in this man- ner, if the thing is well managed, their suspicions can be allayed; and we can get possession of the Court House as soon as our friends get on, which will be by to-morrow noon-- -will it not, Pattersoni?"   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       41 "Yes, unless this cussed flood has carried away all the roads, a well as bridges," gruffly replied the sheriff. "Ys, and if t ese mobbing knaves can be kept quiet till then, we shall be in a situation to ask no favors." "And grant none," said Sabin, with cool bitterness. "You don't learn," asked Chandler, with feigned indifference.- youn don't learn that the people have brought any offensive im- plements with them, do you, Patterson? It might be done "vertly, you know. Has this been seen to, by proper measures, * such as examining the straw in the bottoms of their sleighs, and the like? s' Yes, thoroughly," returned the former; " they have brought noarms with them, at any rate. We are undoubtedly indebted to ycur honor's skilful management with them at Chester for that." "Ay, ay," interposed Stearns, " nobody but the judge could ha ve executed that piece of diplomacy with the fellows. And no one but he can carry out the business successfully now. His h nor must be the one to undertake it." ';Certainly."  "The very an." "He must do it." "They wuld listen to none of us." "The thing is settled, and he must g, unanimously responded the company. "I really feel flattered, gentlemen," replied Chandler, bowing and waving his hand towards the company  highly flattered by your opinion of my capacity to negotiate in this delicate affair. Bt you will 'understand, in case I accede to your wishes gen- tlemen," he containued, With a look of peculiar meaning- ".you wi understand that I am to be considered, on all hands, as utterly opposed to coercive me asures-- to all--I am understood, I sup. pose, gentlemen?"  "Yes, yes, judge," r turned the others, with knowing winks and laughter, , we will 11all understand that you are opposed to the whole move." Having thus arranged business for the morrow to their satisfac-. tion, these astute perso nages; who, like their party generally in  America, at that period seemed to have acted on an entirely false estimate of the intelligence and spirit of the common people, now rose and retired to t!eir respective lodgings, inwardly chuck- ling at their sagacity, in being able to concoct wht they believed would prove a  success f scheme of overreaching and  putting  down their  opponents, a ,at the same time, of establishing their own tottering authority oi a basis which might bid defiance to all future attempts to overtu it. 4*  )           X  C! wI \      *              i.   42          'THE RANGERS, CHAPTER   IV. a' But here, at least, are arms unchainec And souls that thraldom never stainedA."   I As'soon as the company, described in the preceding chapter, had all retired from the room, Brush, bidding, Bart to rake up the fire  'and go to bed, proceeded to lock all the outer doors of the house, ; Imat ering to himself as he did so, "It can't be as Chandler fears, I think, about this fellow's going out to blab to-night; but as this will put an end to the possibillity of his doing it, I may as well make all fast, and then there will be no chance for blame for y suffering him to remain in :he room.' So saying, and putting the different keys in his pocket, he at orice disappeared, on his way to his own apartment. When the isound of his etiring fooquteps had ceased to be heard, Bart, who had lingered in the room, suddenly changed his sleepy, abject i aippearance for a prompt, decisive look and an erect attitude  "Two ideas above a jackass!- two ideas above a jackass, keh?" he said, and slowly repeated, as with flashing eyes he tnodded significantly in the direction his master had taken. "You t may yet find out, Squire Brush, that my ears aint sich a disput 'Sight longer than yourn, arter all." With this he blew out the last remaining light, and groped his way to his own humble sleeping-room, in the low attic story of the back kitchen. Here, however, he manifested no disposition  to go to bed, but sitting down upon the side of his miserable pallet, he remained motionless and silent for fifteen or twenty minutes, when he began to soliloquize: "Jackass! -sleepy devil!- not wit enough to see what they are at in six weeks, eh? Balrty Btiurt, you are one of small fishes, it is true; but, for all that, you needn't be walloped about at this rate, and bamboozled, and swallowied entirely up by the big ones of this court-and-kin party.  You know enough to take care of yourself; yes, and at th same  'time, you can be doing something towards paying these gentry for the beautiful compliments you have had from them to-night, ;and at other times. The fact is, Bart, you are a rebel now- honestly one of them - you feel it in you, and you may as well let it out. So here goes for their meeting, if it is to be fond if I am hanged for it." * - .             I,   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       43      Having, in this whimsical manner, made a sort of manifesto of "s principles and intentions, as if to give them, with himself, a, nore fixed and definite character, he now rose, buttoned up his acket, carefully raised the window of his room, let himself down o the roof of a shed beneath it, and from that descended to the rround, with the easy and rapid motions of a squirrel engaged in mt-gathering. Here he cast a furtive glance around him, and maused some moments, in apparent hesitation, respecting the Course to be taken to find those of whom he was in quest. Soon, lowever, appearing to come to a determination, he struck out nto the main street, and, with a quick step, proceeded on, par- laps a furlong, when he suddenly stopped short, and exclaim d, Hold up, Bart. What did that sly judge say about searching n folks' sleighs, for- what was that word now'?--But never  nind, it meant guns. And what did the sheriff say about a dozen lint-and-steel men having come? Put that and that together low, Bart, and see if it don't mean that the only guns brought into own to-night are packed away in the straw, in the bottom of the leighs of the court party understrappers? Let's go and mouse ound their stopping-place a little, Bart. Perhaps you'll get more lews to carry to the rebels," he added, turning round and making owards the tavern at which those in the interests of the loyalists vere known generally to put up.  On reaching the tavern, and finding all theire still and dark, he ,roceeded directly to the barn shed, and commenced a search, vhich was soon rewarded by finding, in the different sleighs bout the place, twelve muskets, carefully concealed in hay or dankets. With a low chuckle of delight at his discovery, Bart ook as many as he could conveniently carry at one load, and, ;oing with them into the barn, thrust them one by one into the iay mow, under the girts and beams, so as effectually to conceal hem. He then returned for others, and continued his employ- nent till the whole were thus disposed of; when he left the place, nd resumed his walk to the northerly end of the village. After mursuing his way through the street, and some distance down the oad beyond the village, he paused against a low, long log-house, tanding endwise to the road. This house was occupied by a aiddle-aged, single mah, known by the name of Tom Dunning, hough often called Ditter Dunning, and sometimes Der Ditter, n account of his frequent use of these terms 'as prefixes to is words and sentences, arising from a natural impediment of speed. He was a hinter :y profession, and passed most of his me in the doods, or round the Connecticut in catching salmon, *     n   "          THE RANGERS, which, at that period, were found in the river in consid rable numbers, as far up as Bellows Falls. Though he mingle d -but little in society, yet he was known to be well informed resp cting all the public movements of the times; and it was also be lieved that he had enrolled himself among the far-famed band of Green Mountain Boys, and often joined them in their operations against the Yorkers, on the other side of the mountains. Very little, however, was known about the man, except that he was a shrewd, resolute fellow, extremely eccentric, and perfectly impenetrable to all but the few in whom he confided. Bart, from some remark he had overheard in the street, in tl e ear- ly part of the evening, had been led to conclude that the company he now sought were assembled at this house. And though he was personally unacquainted with the owner, and knew n othing of his principles, yet he was resolved to enter and trust to luck to make his introduction, if the company were present, nd, if not, to rely on his own wit to discover whether it were safe to unfold his errand. As he was approaching the house, Dunning hastily emerged from the door, and, advancing with a quick step, confronted him in the path with an air which seemed to imply an exlpetation that his business would be at once announced. Bart, wlho was not to be discomposed by any thing of this kind, manifested no hurry to name his errand, and seemed to prefer that the other should be the first to break the silence. "Ditter - seems to me I have seen you somewhere?" at length said Dunning, inquiringly. "Very likely. I have often been there," replied Bart, with the utmost gravity. , "Ditter - devil you have! And what did you -der ditter I -find there, my foxy young friend?"           ? "Nothing that I was looking for."  "Der - what was that?" "The meeting."  "Der - what meeting?"           . "The one Pd like to go to, may be." "You are a bright pup; but - der- don't spit this way; it might be der-- ditter-- dangerous business to me; for yoe must have been eating razors tonight." "No, I haven't; don t love 'em. But you haven't yit told me where the meeting is?" "6 Ditter - look here, my little chap," said Dunning, getti g im- patient and vexed that he could not decide whether the other was   OR TH "TORYS DATUGHTER.      4 t knave, simpleton, or neither-- " ditter- look here;  der- 1: lon't your folks want you? Hadn't you better run alongow "'  : "Reckon I shall, when you tell me where to go and not run against snags."             r     i "Ditter well, der go back the way you come,hbout ditter as ir again as half way; ider then, ditter turn to the ditter right, ien to the ditter left, then der- ditter-- ditter - ditter -go long! you'll get there before I can tell you." "In no sort of hurry;i will wait till you get your mouth off; lay be it will shoot near the mark, arter all." "Ditter, dog, my cat, if I - der - don't begin to believe you are nsiderable of a critter; and I've half a mind to risk you a tece; so come into the house, and, der--let me take a squint at  3ur phiz in the light."  Taking no exceptions to the character of,the invitation, Bart w followed the other into the house, and, sitting down on a ncqh by the fire, began very unconcernedly to whistle, on a w key, the tune of Yankee Doodle, which was then just begin . ng to be considered a patriotic air. Dunning, in the mean time, king a seat in the opposite corner, commenced his proposed rutiny, which he continued, with one eye partly closed, and th a certain dubious expression of countenance, for some moe rnts, when he observed  ' You are a ditter queer chicken, that's a fact. But I der find w  that I know you, as the ditter divil did his pigs, by sight; I ow also the sort of folks you have been living amongst lately 1 der knowing all that, it's reasonable that I should be a snuffig ittle for the ditter smell of brimstone. So now, if you are ai irt party tory, and come here for nlischief, you've got into a ce that will ditter prove too hot for you; but if, as I rather  ak, you are, or der want to be, something better, and can let into the shape and fix of matters and things over there at ditter -quarters, you may be the chap we would like to see. Ditter ai out therefore, likela man, and no more of your ditter izzling."  Ufter a  few more evasive remarks, in which he succeeded in wing out the other more fully, and causing him the more com.  ely to commit himself, Bart threw aside all bantering, and :ceded to relate all his iscoveries relative to the contemplated' ement of the court paty.  Ditter devils and dumpings!" exclaimed the hunter, as, with i  sparkling with excit ment, he sprang to his feet, a 'the r  finished his recital; "This must be made known directly.; P I         -s)   "          THE RANGERS, Come  der follow me, and I'll take you to the comp ny you ditter said you wished to see." So saying, he immediately led the way through a dark' entry to a room in the rear of the house, which the two now entered; when Bart found himself in a company of nearly twenty grave and stern-looking men, deliberating in a regularly organized meeting.  "Ditter here, Captain Wright," eagerly commenced DIunning, as he entered, addressing the chairman, a prompt, fine-looking man, and the leading whig of the village;" here is one," he continued, pointing to Bart, " one who brings ditter news that----" "Esquire Knowlton, of Townsend, has the floor now," said the chairman, interrupting the speaker, and directing his attention to a middle-aged man of a gentlemanly, intelligent appearance, who was standing on one side of- the room, having suspended the remarks he was making at the entrance of Dunning and his com- panion. "As I was remarking, Mr. Chairman," now resumed the gen- tleman who had been thus interrupted in his speech, " the tory party, acting under various disguises, have been, for several months past, secretly using every means within their reach to strengthen their unrighteous rule in this already sadly oppressed section of the country. They aim to bring the people, into a state of bondage and slavery. When no cash is stirring, with which debts can be paid, they purposely multiply suits, seize property, which thev well know -can never be redeemed, and take it into their hands, that they may make the people dependent on them, and subservient to their party purposes. And just so far as they find themselves Strengthened by these and other disguised move- ments, so far they betray their intention to curtail all freedom of opinion, and to overawe us by open acts of oppression. Here, one man has been thrown into prison on the charge of high trea. son; when all they proved against him was the remark, that if the king had signed the Quebec bill, he had broken his corona- tion oath. There, another, a poor harmless recluse, as I have ever supposed him, is dragged from his hut in the mountains, and imprisoned to ;await his trial for an alleged murder, com- mitted long ago, and in another jurisdiction; when his only crime, with his prosecutors, probably, is his bold denunciations of their tyranny, unless, as some suspect, even a baser motive actu. ates them. They even proclaim, that all who dare question the king's right to tax us without our consent, are guilty of high trea- son, and worthy of death! For myself, I seek not the suspension   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       47 of this court at this tin e, on account of the questionable jurisdic- tion of New York merely, but because the court, itself bitterly tory in all its branches, is sustained by a colony which refuses to adopt the resolves of the Continental Congress, and thereby con- tinues to force upon us the royal authority, which our brethren of the other colonies have almost every where put down, and which in our case, Heaven knows, is not the least deserving the fate it has met elsewhere. And the question, then, now comes home to us, Shall we tolerate it any longer? The hearts of the people, though their tongues may often be awed into silence - the hearts of the people are ready to respond their indignant no! And I, for one, am ready to join in the cry, and stepping into the first rank of the opposers of arbitrary power, breast the storm in discharg- ing my duty to my country." "Amen!" was the deep and general response of the com- pany. "Mr. Dunning will now be heard," said the chairman, motion- ing to the former to come forward. "Ditter well, Captain - der - ditter - Mr. Moderator, I mean. I, being on the watch a gainst ditter interlopers, you know, have just picked up an odd coon, here, who ditter seems to have ears in one place and tongue in another; and his story is a ditter loud one. But let him tell it in his own way. So now, Barty Burt," he continued, going up to the other, who stood by the fire, kicking the fore-stick with his usual air of indifference; " come forward, and tell the meeting all you have der seen and heard, in the ditter camp of the P:filistines." Bart, then, mostly^ in the way of answers to a series of rapid questions, put by the chairman, who seemed to know him, and understand the best way of drawing him out, - Bart then related his discoveries to his astonished and indignant auditors, giving such -imitations of the manner of each of the company, whose wordo he was repeating, as not only showed their meaning in its full force, but at once convinced all present of the truth of his story.  No sooner had Ba t closed, than a half dozen of the company sprang to their feet, in their eagerness to express their indigna- tion and abhorrence 1of the bloody plot, which their opponents, under the garb of peace and fair promises, had, it was now evi- dent, been hatching azgainst them. "Order, gentlemen!" cried the chairman: "I don't wonder you all want to denounce the detestable and cowardly conduct of the tyrants. But one only can be heard at a time, and Mr. i,1.  I      *               .   French, I rather think, was fairly up first, and he will therefore j proce.6d."  While all others, on hearing this remark of the chairman, resumed their seats, the person thus named, as privileged to speak first, remained standing. He was a younga man, of about X twety-two, of a ready, animated appearance, while every look and motion of his ardent countenance and restless muscles pro- claimed him to be of the most sanguine temperament and enthu- ? siastic feelings. An almost unnatural excitement was sparkling in his kindling eyes , a sort of wild, fitful, sad, and prophetic S air characterized his whole appearance as he began.  i "-It bhas come at last, then! I knew it was coming. I have felt it for months; waking and sleeping, I have felt it. In my i dreams I have seen bloodin the skies, and heard sounds of battle , xn the air and earth. Dreams of themselves, I know, are gener- ally without,sign or significance ; but when the spirit of a dream remains on the mind through the waking hours, as it has on mine, I know it has a meaning. Something has been hurrying me to be ready for the great event. I could not help coming  here 'to-night. I cannot help being here to-morrow. The event  and the time are at hand! I see it now - resistance, and battle, and blood! Let it come! the victims are ready; and their blood, poured out on the wood on the altar of liberty, will bring down fire from heaven to consume the oppressors!" There was a short silence among the company, who seemed to pause, in surprise and awe, at the strange words and manner of the young man, which evidently made an impression on his hear- ers at the time, and which-were afterwards remembered, and often repeated, at the fireside, in recounting his untimely fate." "Mr. Fletcher," at length observed the chairman, breaking the silence-"Mr. Fletcher, of Newfane, is next entitled to speak, I believe." ' II rose, Mr. Chairman," said the latter, a fine specimen of the hardy, resolute, and intelligent yeoman of the times - "I rose but to ask whether the news jlust received can be relied on ' "can it be, that Judge Chandler, after his pledge to us at Chester, would be guilty of conduct reflecting so deeply on his character as a ] man?" "I am not wholly unprepared to believe the story myself,"  replied the chairman; " our young friend here may have his pe g culiarities ; but I consider him a thousand times more honest and hoIorable, than some of those whose sly hints and treacherous  conduct he has so well described."    :   "Ditter, look here, Mr. Moderator," interposed Dunning. "I as once, ditter travelling, in the Bay State, with a friend, when e came across a meeting-house with eight sides, and my friend :ked me what order of architecture I called it. Ditter well, I as fairly treed, and couldn't tell. But I should be able to tell Jw. I should ditter call it the Chandler order." A desultory but animated debate now arose. Various methods accomplishing what appeared to be the settled determination of I- that of preventing the sitting of the 'court - were suggested. )me proposed to dismantle or tear down the Court House; others ere for arming the people, seizing the building, and bidding en defiance to their opponents. At this stage of the delibera- Ins, Colonel Carpenter, whose character had secured him great fluence, rose, and requested to be heard. . "From the gathering signs of the times," said he, " we have ,od reason to believe that the smouldering fires of liberty will on burst forth into open revolution throughout these oppressed d insulted colonies. Our movements here may lead to the ening scene of the great drama; and we must- give our foes advantages by our imprudence. If we are the first to appear arms, it may weaken our cause, while it strengthens theirs. :t them be the first to do this--let us place them in the wrong, d then, if they have recourse to violence and bloodshed, we "act; and no fear but the people will find means to arm them- ves. Let us, therefore, go into the Court House to-morrow, in body, but without a single offensive implement, and resist acefully, but firmly; and then, if they dare make a martyr, blood will do more for our cause than would now a regiment rifles." Although this prudent and far-sighted proposal was for a while posed, by the more ardent and unthinking part of the company, t it was at length adopted by the whole; and having made ar. igements to carry it into effect, the meeting broke up, and all' ired to their respective lodgings.              J   OiU         J'tl SK2AU;TH NUB,) CHAPTER V. "Thou ever strong upon the strongest side." ALTHOUGH many were the anxious consultations, and deep plot- tings, among the belligerent parties within doors, during the fore part of the memorable 13th of March, yet it was not till the after- noon of that day had considerably advanced, that any indications of the events which followed became observable in the streets of Westminster. About this time, one of the doors of Crean Brush's guest-filled mansion suddenly flew open, and the crouched and cringing form of our humble friend Barty Burt, hotly pursued by his recent employer wi-h uplifted cane, was seen coming down the steps of the entrance, in flying leaps, to the ground. "There, you infernal booby! please consider this caning and kicking as a farewell to Imy house. and employ forever!" ex- claimed the enraged master, standing in the door-way, and look- ing down with ineffable scorn upon the prostrate person of the ejected Bart, as he lay sprawled out upon the spot where he landed, without manifesting any disposition to rise. "I should like to know what I've done' criminal, squire?" responded the latter, looking back over his shoulder at the other, with a doleful grimace. ," What have you done? ' sharply retorted Brush. "Why, you impertinent puppy, you have done every thing wrong, and nothing right, ever since you got your lubberly carcass out of bed, at the fine time of eight o'clock this morning! and now, to crown all, in clearing off the table, you must go, with your load of meats' and half-filled gravy dishes, through the parlor, where you had no business to go, and there, like a blundering jackass, as you are, you must fall down and ruin the best carpet in the house! I've had quite enough of you, sir: so up with you there, and clear out, you vagabond!" "Well, I 'spose I know what you want," muttered Bart, by way of reply to this tirade--" you want to accuse, and drive me away, so you won't have to; pay me the two crowns you owe me for work, and other things."^ ' i   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       51 "I don't owe you half that sum, you lying lout," returned Brush, fiercely. "But to get rid of such a pest, and prevent your going round town with that lie in your mouth, I'll give you all you ask; and there they are!" he continued, pulling out and disdainfullyltossing the coins down at the other's feet. "Your dirty rags, i you have any in the house, shall be thrown out to you; and ten, if you aint off, I'll set the dogs on ye." With this, and an expressive slam of the door behind him, the \X secretary returned into the house; and in a few moments, the k  sash of a garret window was thrown up, and a pair of shoes, a   pair of old summer pantaloons, a spare coarse shirt, and pair of stockings, were successively flung down into the yard, near where I  the owner was still lying, by the hand of a grinning and blushing   servant maid, while her dainty-fingered master stood by, direct- ig the operation. :  "Well, Bart," now soon began to mutter this singular being, in i  his usual manner of addressing himself as a second person, when t  alone --"Well, Bart, your plan of getting driv away has worked I  to a shaving. You've got your pay, too, jest in the way you cal- I  culated would fetch it; yes, all your honest pay, and one crown   more; but you charged that, you know, when you told him two :  crowns, as camage for the kick and cane lick you got. So that's settled. And as to the other accounts against him, and the rest :  of 'em there, you'll be in a way to square all, fore long, guess; for you will be your own rebel, now, Bart, you know." It  While thus communing with himself, he had slowly, -and with i  many winces of affected pain, gathered up his limbs, risen on to i his feet, pocketed his two crowns, and collected and tied up his clothes. Ar-d he was now, with a grieved look, as if sorrowing for the loss of'his home, looking back to the house, where several curious, half-laughing, half-pitying countenances were seen peer- ing through the windows to witness his departure. He then looked hesitatingly abroad, one way and then the Other, with the sad and despairing air of one who feels there is no place in the wide world where he can find a friendly shelter. After this, with a wince and groan at every step, he slowly hobbled off up the street, losing his lameness, and converting his groans into snickers of low, exulting laughter, a soon as he was out of eye- shot of the company he had left behind him. !  "Kinder 'pears to me, Bart," he at Length said, resuming his soliloquy, as he glanced keenly at the tavern, which was the scene of his last night's exploit, and which he was now passing - 'pears to rr e, there's a good many heads rather close together,   53I         AGTH bNGERS, in spots, round that tory nestl over yonder. They act as if they were in a sort of stew about something. I wonder if they lost their guns last night, or any thing, that puts them in such a pucker," he continued, with a chuckle. "But suppose, Bart, as going this way is only a sham, suppose we now haul up here, and edge over there among 'em a little, to learn what they are up to, before you go to join the company at the Court House." On reaching the yard of the tavern, Bart found that the coir- pany, numbering perhaps twenty in all, had broken from the separate groups in which they had been conversing, and had now gathered round one man, who, having just come out of the tavern, appeared to be communicating to the crowd something that obviously produced considerable sensation. This person was a man of the ordinary size, of fair complexion, light eyes, and an unsettled and vacillating countenance, rendered the more strikingly so, perhaps, by the quick, eager, and restless motiors and manner by which his whole appearance was characterized. Bart soon contrived to work lis way into this circle, till he gained a position from which he could hear what was said. "' You may rely on what I -have told you," said the speaker, as Bart came within hearing; "' for I have just had it from the sheriff and lawyer Stearns. The rebels have been in possession of the Court House about an hour, posted sentinels at all the doors, and openly declare, that the judges and officers shall never enter to hold another court. Nobody dreamed of their darirg on such a bold step, or we should have been before them 'n taking possession of the house, even with the force we had on the ground. But, thinking it best to go strong-handed, the judges concluded they would not go in to open the court till enough of friends should arrive to put down all opposition at a blow. The rebels think now, doubtless, that they have got an advantage which they will be able to maintain. But they will find them- selves a little mistaken, I fancy; for Patterson says he has now got them in just the spot he wanted. This act both he and Stearns decide to be overt treason, which will justify him in taking the course he intends, unless they yield and scatter, tn 'the first summons. But as -hey won't do that, and our forces will shortly be here, you can all guess what we shall now soon .see follow," he added, with a significant wink. "Then why not be gett'ng out our guns at once?" asked one of the company. o No," resumed the speaker; "the plan is to leave that till the last thing before we march upon them, lest the rebels   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       53 should take alarm, and go and arm themselves, and we thus thwart our own intention of -aking them by surprise. You, however, can be kinder carelessly looking up clubs for such as may have no arms, and a few axes and crowhars for breaking into the Court House, if that should be necessary. But, as I said, klet the guns remain hid in the sleighs till you pave orders to take them out. For it is not exactly settled yet whether we shall march upon them as soon as our reinforcements arrive, and besiege them in the house, or coax them out, and so get pos. session ourselves. But, at any rate, you will havle work on hand soon; and if we don't see fun before to-morrow morning, my name aint David Redding.  But come, let's all adjourn to the bar-room, and take a drop to warm us up a little. ' Leaving Reddiu, to his despicable task of endeavoring, in compliance with the directions of those whose base tool he was, to iinflame the company le lihad collected, and work up their feelings to such a pitch of enmity and recklessness as should prepare them to imbrue their hands in the blood of their neigh. bors and countrymen, we will now proceed to note the conduct of more important personages in the events of the day. While the scene above described was transpiring, Patterson, Gate, Stearns, and one or two otiler tory leaders, who had been consulting at this tavern, and taaking their- arrangements for active movements, left the house, and, with hasty steps, took their wa  to the mansion of the haughty secretary, which, by his special invitation, at this crisis, was made the permanent quarters of he judges and principal officers of the court, as well as of his nun erous guests. Upon the whole,- perhaps you are right, Stea'ns," said Pat- ters n, as they were about to enmer the house. "' We will start off chandler to the Court House to make one of his smooth spe!ches, and play Sir Plausible with the rebel rascals, as agreed on I st night, and though he should have done it before, yet he may, even now, succeed in flat;ering them to quit the house long enough for us to get possession; if not, we will take the othe course." I a few moments after these worthies had disappeared within the louse, the door was again opened, and Chief Justice Chandler, the man to whose singularly compounded character, made up of timidity, selfishness, vanity, thirst of power, kindness, and duplcity, or rather the conduct that flowed from it, may be mai ly attributed the bloody tragedy that ensued, now made his appearance in the street. He wore a powdered wig, according   54,          THE RANGERS, to the fashion of the times among men of his official station, and his whole toilet had evidently been made with much atten- tion. Carelessly flirting a light cane in his hand, and assuming an air of easy unconcern, he leisurely took his way along the street, towards the Court House, bowing low, and blandly smiling to every one be met, and often even crossing to the opposite side of the street to exchange salutations with the passers-by; to each of whom, whatever his party or station, he was sure to say something complimentary, and aimed with no little sa- gacity to reach the peculiar feelings and interests of the person addressed. "This is Mr. French, I believe," he said, turning out of his course -to speak to the youncr man introduced in the last chapter, who, with the same restless, anxious look lie then wore, was unobservantly hurrying by the other, on his way to the Court House. "Yes, yes, sir," replied French, slightly checking his speed, and looking back, with a half-surprised, half-vacant expression. "Ay, I was sure I knew you," rejoined the judge. "How are the times with you, Mr. French? You will pardon my freedom, sir, but the great interest I take in the success of our enterprising and intelligent young men like yourself -- But no matter now. I see you are in haste. I will not detain you, sir. A very good day to you, Mr. French." "Well, upon my word, now, here is my friend Colonel Car- penter!" he again exclaimed, as, turning from the person he had just saluted with such poor success, his quick and wary eye caught sight of the gentleman thus addressed coming up behind him. "Most happy to fall in with you, colonel," he continued, grasping and warmly shaling the hand of the other. "How are your family, sir?"Shall I confess it, colonel? I have really sometimes greatly envied you." "Why so, sir ;" asked Carpenter, with a little coolness. "Envied you your well-deserved appellation - that of Friend of the People, as they call you," replied the judge. "The people need a friend at this crisis, I think, sir," responded the unbought yeoman, with cold dignity. * If there is one title that I should covet above all others," resumed the judge/,vithout appearing to notice the drift of the other's remark, " it would be the one I have named. What can be a more truly honorable distinction? I have often regretted being so trammelled by my station on the bench, as to prevent me from acting as I would otherwise like to do. But a judge,   OR- THE TO:LtYS DAUGHTER.      55 you Wk0w, conel, in party times, must not act openly on any par ic lar sideg" "He had better do that, however, than act secretly on all sides," reterntd the other, with biting significance.  "O,1 doubtless, doubtless, sir," rejoined the judge, with a fore sdOlaugh, but with the air of one perfectly unsuspicious of any intended personalities. "Yes, indeed. But, ah!" he con- tinu d,j slightly motioning towards the Court House, against which they had now arrived. "What have we here? A public metink??" "Quite possible. At all even:s I think of going in myself," said Garpenter, quietly turning from the other into the Court Hose yard, but soon pausing a little, though without looking rousd, Ito hear the remarks which the other seemed intent on ma ing. "Inceed! Why, I had not heard of it, else I should have been ple ed to have dropped in. I came out, be sure, only for a  littl exercise, but --- " , , H are he parsed, in expectation that the other would speak; but finding himself disappointed, and left alone in the street, he re. sum 3d his walk, while his now unguarded countenance very plainly showed the disquiet he felt at the rebuffs he had received in his attermpt to conciliate Colonel Carpenter, and obtain from him an invitation to go into the meeting, which, in reality, it was his only a obje't in coming out to attend. h wihile digesting his mortification, and occupied in conjecturing I how he could have become an object of suspicion among the oppoerpUts of the court party, as every thing now seemed to indi.  cate his attention was again arrested by the sounds of approach-  ing otsteps; and, looking up, his eyes encountered the sarcastic t counenance of Tom Dunning, wio, coming from an opposite dire ion, was also on his way to join the company at the Court : Ah, Mr. Dunning! '" exclaimed the judge, starting from his reve ie and downcast attitude, while his face instantly brightened into 4imiLes summoned for the ccasion; right glad to meet you, sir. have been thinking I ust engage some such expert and luck) sortsman, as they say you are, to catch and send me up a fresh salmon, occasionally/ I suppose your never-failing spear wi le ,put in requisition again, when the, spring opens; will it ca er- yes, your worship, unless I turn my attention to the catc ng - ditter - eels, or other slippery varments," returned the   ILHE RANGERS,          .  hunter, with a sly, significant twinkling of his eyes, as he brushed by the rebuked cajoler, and pushed on without waiting for a reply.            i The judge did not pursue his walk much farther; but now, soon facing about, began, with a quickened step and a look of increas- ing uneasiness, to retrace his way (to his quarters. While these little incidents were occurring in the streets, about one hundred sturdy and determined men had collected within the walls of the Court House. As the construction of this building was somewhat peculiar, for one designed for such purposes, it may be necessary, for a clear understanding of the descriptions which follow, to say a few words respecting its interior arrange- ments. The court-room was in the upper story, which was all occupied as such, except the east and south corners, that had been partitioned off for sleeping apartments. In the lower story, there was a wide passage running through the middle of the building, with doors at both erds; while the stairs leading up into the court room faced the principal entrance, on the north-east side of the house. After passing-by the stairs, there was a small passage leading from the large one, at right angles, and funning back between prison-roonis, whose doors opened into it. The part of this lower story, on the opposite side of the main passage, con- sisted also of two rooms, with doors opening into it, and an entry, or short passage, lea ing out into the street. One of these rooms was used as a common, or bar-room, and the other as a sort of parlor, being both occupied. by the jailer and his family. Although there had been, for many weeks, a growing disposi- tion among the party here assembled to prevent the session of a court avowedly acting under royal authority, and spurning all the recommendations of Congress, yet there had been no settled inten- tion among them to resort to any other than the peaceful meas- ures of petition and remonstrance, which they believed would be sufficient to effect the desired result. It had been decided, there- fore, that the court should be permitted to come together; when such representations and arguments were to be laid before them, as could not fail, it was supposed, to convince any reasonable men of the wisdom of listening to the voice of the people. But when, on the preceding evening, it was discovered, in the way before related, and from other sources, that the people had been duped by the duplicity of Chandland that it was the secret purpose of the court, in defia eof all pledges to the contrary, to hold a full session, under the protection of an armed force, the hitherto modest and quiet spirit of patriotism was at once aroused among   71 OR THE TORY'S DUGHTER.               57 .thie resolute little band of revolutionists, and they came to the bol -determination, as we have before seen, of seizing the Court Ho se in advance of their opponents, and holding it till their re onstrances should be heard and heeded. his object, so far as respected the possession of the building, bei g now obtained, the company proceeded to organize and ma e arrangements for maintaining their advantage through the nig t. Their possession, however, was not destined to remain lon  undisputed. In a short time after they had begun to act, their new recruit, Barty Burt, who could not forego his desire of remaicing among th tories (where we left him acting the un- suspected spy on their movements) till they should look for their guns, that he might have the pleasure of witnessing their discom- fiture on discovering their loss, now arrived with news, that the latter, as soon as they made the discovery that thee ir arms had been abstracted, were thrown into the greatest commotion; and that under the direction of Patterson an  Gale, both foaming with rage, they had hastily collected all the ffensive implements they could find, with the avowed determination of making an immedi- ate assault on their opponents at the Court House. But notwith- standicg this startling intelligence, no, one manifested the least disposition of quitting his post. And although there was not a weapon of defence, beyond a cane, in the whole company, yet they seemed none the less incliend to maintain their position in conseq ence of the threatening aspect which the affair was be- ginning to assume; but resolving, by acclamation, to keep pos- session of the house till compelled by force of arms to relinquish it, they placed a few strong and resolute men as guards at every door, and quietly awaited the result. i And they were not kept long in suspense. In a short time, Patterson and his posse, armed with several old muskets, swords, pistols, and clubs, made their appearance, and, with many hostile maiifestations, came rushing up wit in a few yarcs of the door. Commanding a halt, the sheriff then, in a loud and arrogant tone summoned the company within to come forth ahd disperse. No oice, however, was heard to respond to the summons. Gale, th  clerk, then proceeded, upon the intimation of the former, to read the king's proclamation to the outward walls of the house, or the supposed listeners within, with great form and solemnity. "Ditter- dickins  exclaimed Tom Dunning, after listening a moment to the reading of the riot act, or proclamation, as it was usually called, as, with several others, he stood just within the   entrance. "Now I wonder if they expect to rout a body of Green Mountain Boys with that sort of- di{ter - ammunition? i . "There!" fiercely cried Patterson, as the reader concluded his task. "'There, you d  d rascals, now disperse, or, by Heaven, I will blow a lane through ye!" "Only - ditter - hear that!" again remaked the hunter, con- temptuously, at the menace and profanity of the haughty officer. "Natural enough, though, mayhap, for a bag of wind to blow, if it does any thing. He is rather smart at der - sweariing, too, I think. But even at that, I guess he would have to haul in his horns a little, if old Ethan Allen was here, as I wish he was, to let off a few blasts of his - ditter- damnations at him." Captain Wright, after a brief constltation with the other leaders, now coming down from the court-room, opened the door/ (Dun- ning and another strong-armed man having hold of it tc guard against a rush,) and addressed the besiegers. "Why is all this, gentlemen?" e said, in a respectul, but firm manner. "Are you come here for war? We are 1iere for no such purpose, ourselves. We came with none othlr than peaceful intentions. And so long as wet can say that, a d say, also, above all, that we have come together with the approbation of the chief judge of your court, who has promised us a fair hearing of our grievances; and sol long as, in direct v olation of that judge's pledge to us, you appear here in arms, to intimi- date us, let me assure you, we sh 11 not disperse under your threats. We, however, will permit you Ito come in, if you will  lay aside your arms; or we will hold a parley with you as you are."  "D--n your parley!" exclaim d Gale, furiously. "6 I)-- n the parley with such d--d rascals as you are! I will hold 'no parley with such d----d rascals, bul by {his!" he added, draw. ing a pistol, and brandishing it towards' his opponents. "Ay! ay!", cried Redding, who, next to the sheriff and clerk, appeared to be the most violent and officious among the assailants: " talk about being here without arms, and for pece, do ye? when you have stolen a dozen of our guns, and hae now got them in there among you. Pretty fellows, to talk abo lt par j ley? We will give you a parley that will send you all to hell before morning!"  Wright here began a denial of the charge made by t e last speaker; when he was interrupted by Dunning, who, joggi g him, said, in an undertone,--  ,. .    E:;   OR THE- TORY S DAUGHTER.       59-  "Let-'em-der-believe it. They are such--ditter -- cowards, that the idea of a dozen guns among us will make 'em, more mannerly than all the preaching you could-- ditter-- do in a  month."  ' Concluding to profit by this suggestion of the sagacious hunter, Wright now retired within doors, followed by the hisses, curses, and all manner of abusive epithets, of the assailants. The besiegers, now finding that the king's proclamation, on whose potency for quelling the risings of the rebellious colonists, the tory authorities, at the commencement of the revolution, seemed to have greatly counted, did not annihilate their oppo- nents, and, not seeing fit to attempt to carry their threats into  execution at present, hey soon drew off a short distance, and apparently held a cons Itation. While they were thus occupied, small deputation was sent out to them from the Court House, with another offer to hold a conference. But their proposals being received with fresh insults and abuse, they returned to the house; while Patterson and ihis forces, evidently fearing to anture an attack, with their present strength, on the other party, homr they suspected to be armed with the lost guns, now moved  to head-quarters, to report progress, and wait for the expected i reenforcement, to hasten whose arrival, expresses had been de-' spatched several hours before.  A short time after the disappearance of Patterson's band, Judge handler unexpectedly came up to the Court House, wholly unat.  nded, and being readily admitted, he at once ascended into the urt-room, and entered the somewhat surprised, but unmoved sembly, bowing low to individuals on the right and left, as he passed on to an unoffered seat, with the gratified air of one, who, after many detentions, has the satisfaction of getting at length  to the company of his friends.  After a rather embarrassing pause, the judge rose, and made  short speech, which left his hearers but little the wiser respect- his real wishes and intentions, though he had much to say aut his solicitude for the welfare of th people, and his anxiety Lt they should do nothing to injure their cause. After he was ;ted, Wright, Carpenter, and Knowlton, each in turn, addressed a, stating, in general terms, the views and wishes of their 'ty, and reminding him of his pledge, that no arms should be ught by the officers of the court, the recent violation of which y hoped he would be able to explain;.  Jpon this, the former rejoined, declaring with great assurance I not a little to the surprise of many in the room, that the    60          THE RANGERS, arms: comp ained of had been brought without his knowledge and against his express wishes; and he concluded by assurin his friends, as he said he was proud to believe he might safel call them, tnat he would go and immediately secure the arms i question; s3 that the company might now retire, ir. full cont dence that their petitions would obtain a: fair hearing, when th court came together the next morning. The speaker then n sumed his seat, and glanced persuasively around him for som tokens of assent or approbation. But the men, whom he ha thus undertaken to wheedle, had been taught by experience 1 heed the cautioO so well recommended by the tuneful Burns, - ' Beware the tongue that's smoothly hung," - and a chilling silence was the only response that greeted him. "You hear his honor's remarks," observed the chairman at length breaking the ominous silence. "Have you any prop, sitions to make before the judge retires.'i Another long interval of deep silence ensued; when Toy Dunning's tall, sinewy form, and sharp, bronzed features, screwe up with an expression of sly mischief, was seen rising from back seat in the room. "Seeing no one else," he said, " see s - ditter -disposed accept your invitation, Mr. Moderator, I don't - ditter - know bt I will make a small proposition on the occasion. Now, as I tal it, we are to remain here to-night; and as we have now learne that the judge and the people here are the - ditter-best of friend I would just move, Mr. Moderator, that his honor be - der - dittE --invited to take up lodgings with up in the Court House to-nigh so that, if tie enemy comes," he added, imitating the manner ( the judge, as described by Bart, "he can assist us to - ditter- ' temporize - temporize - till " Here the hunter bobbed down into his seat, while explosiN bursts of lauighter rose from several parts of the room, and a lot half-smothered titter ran through the whole assembly, at this sly, b cutting allusion to the part last night taken by the double-dealir judge, who now sat before them, looking, for the moment, like 'suddenly detected criminal. He, however, while the chairme was calling to order, recovered his command of countenance, an by the time the tumult had subsided into the less ncisy expre sions of mirth, he was smiling as gayly as the rest, and affectil to consider the remarks of the stammering humorist as merely - 0leasant joke. "There is no cheating our friend Dunning out of his joke,   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       irl perceive," he said, rising and taking up his hat; " and, indeed, I don't know that I can blame a hardy woodsman for laughing at the Xj  idea of one of our in-door and tender professional men, like myself, sleeping on floors and benches. I am afraid we deserve it for our r   effeminacy. Yes, yes, a good joke, truly! and a good laughter. i; i::' moving joke is an excellent thing to go to bed upon, they say," he added, as with a merry, gleeful look, he bowed himself out of the assembly. "'  No further comments were offered by any of the company upon the communications of this official double-dealer, after his departure; for all seemed to think that the single shot of Dun- ning had rendered all further comments on his speech, and his motives in coming there to make it, entirely superfluous. And they therefore proceeded, as if nothing but an ordinary inter- ruption had occurred, to the business on which they were en. gaged when the judge came in--that of passing some fresh resolves expressive of their determination to hold the Court House in defiance of the threats of their opponents, and of their now settled purpose of no longer submitting, on anv conditions, to the continuance of a court which had proved itself so corrupt and treacherous. After this, and making arrangements for the posting and relieving of guards at the doors for the night, a part of the ; company left the house to seek lodgings elsewhere, as the usual hour of rest had now arrived.  ; & When the nonplused and disconcerted Chandler left the Court !  House, he rapidly took his way back to his quarters, from which   he had been started out by Patterson and Gale, to see' if he   might not be able to accomplish by fair words what they had !  failed to effect by foul. Although he had put the best possible face upon the mortifying occurrence he had just been compelled At to meet, and had made, as he believed, a handsome exit from the company, yet he felt keenly conscious that he had not only X  utterly failed in the object of his visit, but that much of his late base conduct was known. He perceived this in the allusions of Dunning, the pith of which he had affected not to understand. He had seen it, he had felt it, in the significant and knowing glances that had been exchanged on every side around him, and especially in the bitter derisive laugh that had assailed his tingling ears I He had also been taught a new lesson in the interview! He had seen, in the firm manner and determined looks of those he had been confrnting- he had seen that which told him of a spirit at work among the people, that the loyal party, with all their boasted strength, might not long be able to quell. He 6   THE RANGERS,               Ci began now, with the instinctive sagacity of the true office-seeker, to perceive the possibility, perhaps probability, that the power of dispensing office and patronage was about to change hands; and he inwardly trembled for his own safety.   He found himself, in short, in one of those straits, to which men of his character are not unfrequently reduced - that of being wholly at a loss to decide which side was most likely to become the strong- est. Could he have foreseen and decided this, his mind would have been comparatively at ease; for he could have then trimmed his sails, so as to steer clear of the political breakers which he knew were somewhere ahead. Some course, however, he must decide unon; and after lamenting his inability to Fierce the future, so far as to know which party was destined to prevail, and thus secure the important advantages that might be derived from shaping his present course accordingly, he at length re- solved to keep aloof, at present, from both parties, believing he had so adroi;ly managed thus far, that whichever side might triumph, he could put in a specious claim of having acted with it, in reality, from the first. And having now made up his mind to this course, he avoided meeting the tory leaders again; and, seeking out a safe mes- senger, and sending him to tell them, that4' he had left the com- pany at the Court House as he found it," and that "a forgotten business engagement had compelled him to be absent from their councils for a few hours," he took his way to a distant part of the village, where he called on an acquaintance of neutral politics. And here becoming much engaged in conversation, and feigning to have forgotten the hour of the night, he was at last prevailed on to accept, as he did with great seeming reluctance, the invi- tation of his host to tarry till morning. After Patterson and his minions retreated from thel Court House; they returned to the tory tavern, and there remained several hours, alternately cursing their opponents for rebellious obstinacy in not yielding to their commands and menaces, and their ex- pected friends for their tardiness in reaching the place. And affairs remaining in this situation till a late hour in the evening, they were on the point of giving up all thoughts of renewing the attack that night, when the long and anxiously looked for re- enforcement, consisting of thirty or forty armed men, came hur- rying on to the ground. The sinking spirits and waning courage of the blustering sheriff and his confederates now instantly re- vived; and, exulting that they now had the power to glut their vengeance, they resolved on making an immediate assault. And,   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.              63 after fortifying their courage with liberal potations of brandy, the whole party, now swelled, not only by the freshly arrived forces, but by Brush, Peters, Stearns, and many others, who had declined joining in the first sally, to nearly one hundred men, eagerly set forward to the scene of action. The other party, in the mean time, though still maintaining a watchful guard at the doors of the Court House, had yet been so long exempted from an attack of their foes, that they were now in but little expectation of being any further molested till the next morning. And some were lying stretched upon the benches in the court-room, asleep; some, with their great-coats under their heads, were reposing on the floors of the different passages of the house; while others were sitting round the fires, engaged in smoking and conversation. Among those taking their turns as sentries, at this juncture, were Woodburn and Bart, who, with each a stout cane or cudgel in his hand, were now stationed at the principal entrance. "They are coming! " cried Bart, who, having gone out into the street to ascertain what might be the noise which they had heard at a distance, now came running up, with an excited air' to his companion; " they are upon us again, with twice as many men as before, and plenty of guns!" " "In with the news! " said Woodburn, as the appearance of the hostile party wheeling up towards the Court House the next instant confirmed the other's statement--" in with the news, and tell them to man the doors, or in two minutes we shall be routed." Instantly springing into the door, which he unfortunately left open, Bart made the announcement to French, who was restlessly moving about in the passage, and who repeated the same in a voice which started all, both above and below to their feet. " 't They are coming for our blood !" he added, in a tone of strange, wild glee. " Ay, there they come! I see them levelling their guns in the yard! Now for the victims! Let us die like  -" The report of two or three muskets, and the whistling of bullets through the passage just over his head, cut short the speaker. A moment of breathless silence ensued; when the harsh, ruffian voice of Patterson was heard from without,- " Damn ye, why don't you fire ?" A general discharge of the fire-arms of the assailants, flashing fiercely on the surrounding darkness, and sending their deadly  "          THE RANGERS, missiles through the passage, windows, and sides of the house, in every direction, instantly followed the ferocious order. And, in the expiring light, the fated FrenCh was seen to leap into the air; and then, spinning giddily round and round an instant, fall, with a low, short screech, prostrate on the floor; while mingled groans, rising from a half dozen others along the passage, told also the fearful effect of the murderous volley. With the discharge of their arms, the assailing force, guide'- by their torch-bearers, made a rush for the Court House. As " they approached the door, Wo dburn, who had kept his post, unhurt, on one side of the steps, sprang forward to dispute their passage, and, after knocking up the swords and bayonets that were aimed at his breast, laid about him so lustily with his cudgel, that the whole party were, fcr some moments, kept at bay. At length, however, Peters, who was near the rear of the hostile column, perceiving it was his hated opponent who was disputing the pass so resolutely, stealthily crept round those in front, and coming up partly behind his intended victim, with a protruded sabre, aimed a deadly lulnne at his body, exultingly exclaiming with the supposed fatal thrust,-- "There! d-- d rebel, take that!" "And you that!" cried ithe other, who, having, from a lucky turn in his body at the instant, received only a flesh-wound on the inner side of his arm, ing v, with an upward sweep of his cudgel, knockedthe sword bf the detestable assassin twenty feet into the air--"and you thait! ay, and that!" he added, as, with a quickly repeated blow over the head, he sent his foe reeling to the earth. But the weapon of the intrepid young man being now caught, and his body fiercely grappled by four or five of his exasperated foes, he was soon disarmed, and, in spite of his desperate strug- gles, borne into -he court-house with the crowd, who now rushed furiously along the passages, whunding with their swords, and beating down w:th their guns and clubs, without distinction or mercy, all whom they met in their way. "Guard the doors instantly!" shouted Patterson, who perceived that numbers of the vanquished party were retreating through the different doors; E' don't let another of the d d rascals escape! And, halfo there, jailer! bring on the keys of the prison-rooms; we will cage the whole lot, dead or alive, and let 'em be enjoying a few of the fruits of their rebellion now, and the blessed anticipa- lions of being hung for high treason hereafter."   OR THE TORY'S -DAUGHTER.       65 The obsequious jailer soon appeared with the required keys; and the doors of both prison-rooms were speedily unlocked and thrown open by the directions of the sheriff. "Now, tumble them in, boys!" resumed the sheriff, with look and tone of savage exultation. Eager to obey, the supple tools of arbitrary power now comrn. menced driving all those of their prisoners who had not been too much disabled by their wounds to stand, together into the prison. rooms. They then seized hold of the wounded, who lay welter- ing in their blood in different parts of the floor of the long pas- sage, and began dragging them along by their limbs to the same destination. "Monster!" exclaimed Woodburn, looking back from   the felon's cell which he was about to enter, and addressing Redding, who stood mimicking, with fiendish glee, the groans and contor- tions of French, as he lay gasping and writhing in- mortal agony on the spot where he fell, just beyond the short passage dividing the prison-rooms-- " monster," he repeated, " would you insult % the dying?" "Yes, d-n you!" savagely interposed Gale, stepping forward; he has got just what he deserved; and I wish there were forty more of you in the same predicament. Drag him along in there with the rest of'em, Redding!"     i . "Ay, ay," responded Patterson, "in with him! And I can tell the rest of them, they had better be saving their pity for them- selves, for they will all be in hell before to-morrow night!" It is needless to say that this brutal order was promptly obeyed. And when the dying and insensible victim, pierced through head and body, andall the wounded, had been drawn in and thrown promiscuously together, on the cold, damp floors of the prison- rooms, the keys ere turned upon them ; and their remorseless butchers, making hot the least provision for the sufferers, by way of medical aid or otherwise, returned, after posting a strong guard at the doors, to the tavern or the house of Brush, to celebrate their victory in a drunken carousal. 6*   I THE RANMERS) CHAPTER   VI. "The b-and is on their brows, A dark and guilty spot; 'Tis r e'er to be erased, 'Tis ne'er to be forgot." WHATEVER may be the result of the present public movement for the abolitionr of capital punishment, and however far future xperiments may go towards establishing tie expediency and fety of such a change in criminal jurisprudence, the history of very nation and people will show, we believe, the remarkable 'fact, that ever since Cain stood before his Maker with his hands reeking with the blood of his murdered brother, and his heart so deeply smitten with the consciousness of having justly forfeited his own life by taking the life of another, that he could not divest himself of the belief that all men would seek to slay him, no one principle has been found to be more deeply implanted in the human breast than the desire to see the wilful shedding of blood atoned for by the blood of the perpetrator. So strong, so active, land so impelling, indeed, seems this principle, -hat no sooner goes forth the dread] tale of homicide, than all community rise up, as one man, instinctively impressed with the du ty of hunting down. the guilty and bringing thdm to justice; while the guilty them- selves seem no-less instinctively impressed with the abiding con- sciousness that tie doom, which heaven and earth has decreed to their crimes, must inevitably overtake them. Deep and fearful was the excitement, in the hitherto quiet and peaceful village of Westminster, as from mouth to mouth, and house to house, spread the startling intelligence, that a meeting of unarmed citizens, assembled at the Court House, had been assailed, and numnbers shot down in cold blood by the minions of British authority'. The whole town was soon in commotion. No loud noise or clamor of voices, it is true, Wvas heard proclaiming the deed on the midnight air; but the rapid footfalls of men hur- rying along the streets, the hastily exchanged inquiry, the eager, suppressed tones of those conversing in small groups at the corners and by-places around the village, the hasty oper-ing and shutting of doors, and the dancing of lights in every direction, gave ominous indication of the feeling that had every where been awakened,   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.        ' and the secret movement which was every where afoot among the people. A small band, who had gathered in the yard of what was called the People's Tavern, were listenirtg, with many a demonstration of horror and indignation, to the account of one who had escaped ( from the Court House after the tories had got possession. "Where are our leaders, Morris?" asked one of the listeners, as the speaker, a fluent, energetic young man, closed his recital of the atrocities he had witnessed. "Did they escape, or are they among the wounded and prisoners?" "Wright and Carpenter had gone off before we were attacked," was the reply; " the rest, not among the wounded I have named, escaped in the confusion, I think, except Dr. Jones, of RocKing- ham, who was driven into the felon's hole with other prisoners; and it may be well that he was, perhaps, as those bloodthirsty brutes would have suffered no surgeon to be sent for to attend those who are not past help." "And Tom Dunning, whose rifle we shall need,--what became of him?" "He got out in the same manner I did. We stood in a dark corner, at the head of the stairs, taking note of the proceedings; below ; when that crafty little chap, that joined us from BrushiY, came wriggling like an eel out from between the legs of the crowding tories, in the passage; and, working himself up stairs unnoticed, in the same-way, beckoned us to follow him, as we did, into the court-room, where, at his suggestion, we stripped off the sheets of a bed, in one'of those corner sleeping cuddies, made a rope, and by it let ourselves down through a window to the ground in the rear of the house; when we separated, Dunning going home, as he said, to arm himself. But here he cdme;" added the speaker, peering out towards the street, from which several forms were dimly seen approaching-" here he comes; and those just behind him I should judge to be Carpenter and Fletcher, by their gait." "Well, Dunning," asked one of the company, as the huntei came striding up to the spot, " what is your response to all this?" "Der--sixty bullets, and a- ditter-- pound of powder '? was the stern and significant reply of the other, as with one hand he struck his rattling bullet-pouch and huge powder;horn, and with the other brought down the breech of his rifle with a heavy blow upon the ground, "That's the man for me!" exclaimed Fletcher, now coming up with Carpenter. A.                     ,,   -68   -   .   THE RANGERS, 4Ay, Dunning is right!!" said'Carpenter, with emphasis; " if we hold our peace now the very stones will cry out for vengeance! But talking is only a small part of what must be done. We must act. And first of all, this tale of murder and outrage must in- stantly be thrown upon the four winds of heaven. and carried into every town in this part of the settlement. Who will volunteer to ride express with the news? - news which, if - know any thing of the spirit of the great mass of our people, will be taken as a call to arms, and responded to accordingly." Several eager voices announced their readiness to start off at once on the proposed mission. "Follow me to the stables, then," resumed the stanch patriot, hastily leading the way to the barn, and throwing open a stable door. "There!" he continued, pointing to a pair of large, active- looking brutes, feeding together in one stall -" there are my two horses--take them. Let one of their riders go north, the other south; and spare no horse-flesh of mine in an emergency like this; but ride and rally, till you have sent the bloody tale to every house and hut this side the mountains. And you, Morris and Dunning, accompany me to Captain Wr'ght's. More mes- sengers must be despatched west and east, i-nto the borders of New Hampshire, and much other business done before morning." A far different scene, in the mean while, was in progress among the inmates of the loyal mansion, which we have before described, and which was destined to give shelter that night to the last con- clave of royal office-holders ever known in the Green Mountains. Although the leaders of the court party had returned from the sanguinary scene they had enacted, in high. exultation at the decisive victory they supposed they had achieved over their despised opponents, yet neither their own vain boastings, nor the deeply-quaffed wines of their host, could long keep up their spirits. Conscience soon began to be busy among them ; and their hearts waxed faint and fearful at the thought of what they had done. They instinctively drew close together, conversed in subdued tones, or sat uneasily listening to the sounds that occasionally reached them from without. And whatever they might have said to keep up their own and each other's courage, it soon be- came apparent that secret misgivings, fears, and forebodings of a coming retribution had taken possession of their guilt-smitten bosoms, And there was another person in that house, to whom the tragical events of the night brought deep disquietude; but it was a disquietude of quite a different character from that which was   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER. -      69 experienced by the troubled wretches we have named: that person was the Tory's Daughter-- the pure, guileless, and noble- minded Sabrey Haviland. Having been apprised of the intention of Patterson and his confederates to make an assault upon their opponents as soon as the expected reenforcements arrived, her anxieties on the subject had prevented her from retiring to rest, as her less concerned come panion did, at the usual hour. And when the startling report'of fire, arms broke upon the stillness of the night, she was not, like many others in the village, at loss to know the cause; and her fears led her to divine but too well the fatal result. And after an interval of painful suspense, which was terminated by the return of the tory leaders to the house, she stole softly out of her chamber to the head of the stairs, and there listened with mingled emotions of horror and disgust to the boastful recital of their sanguinary deeds, as given by the heartless Gale and others, to her father and Judge Sabin, who had remained in the house, but who, she per- ceived with sorrow, were warm approvers of all that had been done; But, as revolting to her gentle nature as was the general descrip- tion of the event, the particulars the exulting narrators soon pro- ceeded to give were much more so. And when she heard them relate the affray between Woodburn and Peters, and heard the latter, while making light of his own hurts, boast that he had first given the other a thrust with his sword through the body, which must finish him before morning, she could listen-no lon/geri but, hastily retiring to her room, she walked the apartment for nearly an hour in the deepest agitation and distress. Among the many excellent traits of Miss Haviland's character, a lively sense of right and wrong, together with a deep and abiding love of truth and justice, unquestionably predominated. So strong and controlling, indeed, was this principle in her bosom, that it exhibited itself in all her conversation, and seemed to be the governing motive of all her actions. And when -she had' once discovered the truth and the right, at which she ap. peared to arrive with intuitive quickness, no wheedling or sophis, try could blind her to their force; and no inducements could be offered sufficient to cause her to waver in their support. And yet this peculiar trait, as deeply seated as' it was, and as firmly as it was ever exercised, was so beautifully tempered by the 'benevolence of her heart, the equanimity of her mind, and the engaging sweetness of her demeanor, that it never seemed to im- part the least tinge of arrogance to her character, or harshness to her manners. On the contrary, she was all gentleness and !   IV   .-      -L nMAlNt wanLZC affection, and ever ready to comply with the wishes of others, when a compliance did not contravene, in her opinion, any of the principles of even-handed justice; and, in case she felt bound to refuse to yield to their requests, her 'refusal was made and maintained with such -mild firmness, that'none could be offended, none feel inclined to charge her with obstinacy or per. verseness. She was at this time the mistress of her father's household, her exemplary and intellectual mother having several years before deceased, and her elder and only sister, the year previous, married one of the leading loyalists of Guilford. And it had been mainly through the influence of this sister and her husband, that she had been induced, the preceding fall, to take ; the step which was destined to cause her years of sorrow and t perplexity-that of engaging herself in marriage to Peters.  a She had found few or no opportunities of studying this man's character, having known him only as a parlor acquaintance, of easy manners and considerable intelligence. And although she ,saw nothing particularly objectionable in him, and although she knew that, in point of wealth and family distinction, he was con- sidered what is termed a desirable match, yet she had entered into the engagement with many misgivings, and in compliance rather with the wishes of her friends above named, seconded by the urgent request of her father, than in accordance with the die- tates of her own judgment and inclination. But whatever her doubts at that time, or during the months immediately following, ? they had not been sufficient to disturb the usual even tenor of her feelings, till she left home on her present excursion, during which, as already intimated, she had seen the character of her affianced in a new light--a light which showed him to be pos. sessed of traits as abhorrent to her feelings, as, to her mind, they were base and reprehensible in themselves. And now, to crown all, he had, by an act of deliberate, private malice, even according to his own account, inflicted a mortal wound on the victim of his former injuries- the man who, butr the day before, had snatched i her, whom the. other professed to hold as the highest object of his earthly solicitude, from a watery grave. It was these painful a reflections that were noW agitating her bosom; for the more she pondered upon the conduct of Peters, the more did her heart i reject and despise him; aird in proportion 'as her feelings rose up against him were her sympathies drawn towards his victim, Woodburn, whose noble act had created so strong a claim upon her gratitude, and whose character and appearance had alike awakonqd her interest and admration,   OR THE; TORY'S DAUGHTER.       71. "Is it indeed' thus," she at length uttered, as" if summing up he thoughts that had been passing through her mind, "'that he vho saved my life, at the risk of his own, must die by the hand )f one who should have been the first to thank and reward him? ly, and die, too, without receiving from me, or mine, one word f acknowledgment, even, of the service he so nobly rendered? "erhaps the thought of our ingratitude is now embittering his lying moments! Can I, should I suffer this so( to remain?" Here she relapsed into silence, and, slowly resuming her walk - ound the room, seemed for a while immersed in anxious thought;  then she suddenly paused I and, after a moment of apparent :resolution, stepped to the wall, and gave two or three pulls at ie wire connected with the servants' bell in the kitchen. In a 3w minutes the summons was answered by the appearance of ie chamber-maid. "Will you go down to the gentlemen's sitting-room," said Miss [aviland, " ask out my father, and tell him I would see him a  : ioment in my own room? 'a  The girl disappeared, and, in a short time, Esquire Haviland, ith a slightly disturbed and anxious air, entered the room, and i rid,-      .- "What's the matter Sabrey? Are you sick to-night, that you  re yet up-and send for me?"  4"O, no," replied the other; " nothing of that kind led me. to 't1 nd for you, but my wish to make a request which I was un-    it illing to delay."                         The squire cast a somewhat surprised and inquiring look at   I s daughter, but remained slent, while the latter resumed:--  "You recollect that this morning, after apprising you of the  -I :tent of our obligations to Mr. Woodburn, about which you     em to have been so misinformed, I suggested that a personal   f knowledgment; with offers of some more substantial token of  ! r gratitude, should be immediately made to him. Has this v   iI en done "'I "No," replied he, with a gathering frown: " having under-  )od the fellow was assorting with the rebels in their treasonable  ots, I did not feel myself bound to seek him in such company.  ?: that all you wish of me?'  , ' It is not, sir," she answered seriously, and with the air of one  termined not to be repulsed. "I have accidentally become     l prised that Mr. Woodburni in the affray bf to-night, has beenil ngerously wounded, and, in this conditioni, thrust into prison. Id, as we have now an op ortunity of testifying our- sense, of:- *'.' . ; '.    72,         THE RANGERS, his services, it is my earnest request that you procure his release from prison, for which your influence here, I know, is sufficient; that he may be brought out to-night and properly attended."' "-Insane girl!" muttered the father, angrily, i" what can have put that absurd project into your head? Had you been abed hours ago, as you ought, instead of being up and prying into the doings of our authorities, with which a woman has no concern, I should have been spared this exhibition of folly. Why, the wretched fellow is but receiving the just deserts of his crimes. He is in prison for high treason; and had I the will, which I have not, I could not procure his release." "I cannot believe these opposers of the court will be held to answer for such a crime. Indeed, it has occurred to me that the authorities themselves may be called to account for firing upon these unarmed men; and therefore I still hope you will use your exertions for Woodburn's release," urged the fair pleader. "You are to be the judge what is treason, then, hey? And you are ready to side with these daring and desperate fellows, and condemn our authorities, are you? What assurance! You will hardly persuade me to favor your mad projects, I think," harshy retorted the bigoted old gentleman. "You can, at least, go to the prison and return him the ac- knowledgments which our character and credit require of us," still persisted the former. "Well, I shall do no such thing," replied the other, with angry impatience; "for I consider the fellow's conduct to-night has wholly absolved me from my obligations to him, if I was ever under any," he added, rising to depart. "I do not view it so, father," returned the unmoved girl, in a mild, expostulating tone, " and I am sorry for vour decision ; for, if those whose place it more properly is to do this, refuse to perform it,- I know not why I should not myself undertake the duty." f"You!" " Yes, father." "What, to-night?"  "Certainly; another day may be too late." ? "l Madness and folly! , Why, who is to attend you, silly girl " "' If no gentleman is to be found with courtesy enough to attend me, I shall not hesitate to go alone, sir." "We will see if you do!" exclaimed the old gentleman, looking back from the entrance at the other, with an expression of scorn. ful defiance--" we will see if you d, madam!" he repeated,   OR THE TORY'S DAUI6HTER.       73 closing the door after him, and turning the key oh liis. da"ugltii. whom he thus left a prisoner in her own rolm. As Miss Haviland listened to the springing bolt and her father's departing steps, a slight flush overspread: her face at the ttlougi of the indignity thus put upon her, and she rose, and, after put- ting her hand to the door to assure herself that she was not mis- taken, proceeded, with a calm, determined air, to a table 6oin odie side of the room, on which stood the materials for writing; and here, taking pen and paper, she seated herself, and addressed -a brief note to Woodburn, delicately expressing her sense of obligation to him, and concluding with the hope that she might soon have it in her power to do something, towards alleviating his present situation. Having signed, sealed, and superscribe6d the billet, she rose and stood some time hesitating and irres- olute. By what means could this note, now it was-, written-, be madie' to reach its destination? Should she again summori the- chamber-maid, she presumed her father had so managed that the call would not be answered; besides, she felt a repugnance to' the thought of resorting to such means. What other method could then be devised? While thus casting about her for some expedient for effecting her" purpose, she thought she heard some one placing a ladder against- the side of the house, beneath a window, opening from the reari end of the passage adjoining her room; and, after listening a moment, she distinctly heard the person cautiously ascending. l ot being of a timid cast, she quickly removed the thick, heavy" curtains of the window in her room next and very near the I one' under which the unknown intruder was mounting the ladder, and4, throwing up the sash, peered out; when, to her surprise, shi' beheld, and at once recognized, the queer-looking figure of Bartfy' Bjrt, standing on the top round of the ladder, scratching his headl, and giving other tokens of embarrassment at being thus unex. pectedly caught in this situation. X "Master Bart," said Miss Haviland, who had becomesome-. what acquainted with the other, while supplying her room with fuel, previous to his ejbetion from the house, to which she was knowing, "' your appearance, at this time, to say the least of itf causes me much surprise." "I returns the compliment, miss," replied Bart; "so thaf makes us even, and no cuestions on ither side, don't it?"A "Perhaps not, sir," returned the former, with seriousness: "at all events, you should be able to give a,good reason for your' 7   appearance here, under such circumstances: please explain your object." ," And if I don't, you will sing out for the squire, you said? Well, I can get down, and off, before he can get here, I reckon," responded Bart, in a tone of roguish defiance. "I did not say I would call Esquire Brush; but, unless you explain----" i"Yes, yes, jest as lieves Was not, and will, if you'll keep shut till I can run up garret and back." "Your purpose there, sir?" "An honest one--only ito get my gun up there, which the squire didn't have put out for me, when he dismissed me with his high-heeled shoes, to-day, and which I darsent name then, fear he'd have that thrown down, like my 'tother duds, and break it-- only that -and if you'll say nothing, and let me whip in, and up to get it, I'll lay it up against you, as a great oblige, to be paid for, by a good turn to you some time, miss." "If that is all, go - and I may wish to speak with you when you come back,"  So saying, she gently let down the sash, and, withdrawing a little from her window, stood awaiting the result; when she soon heard the other, with the light and stealthy movements of a cat, enter the house, and ascend into the garret, through a small side. door, opening from the passage we have named. Scarcely a minute had elapsed before she again heard his footsteps stealing 1 back by her door to the window, through which he had so noise-* lessly entered when, once tmore raising the sash of her own, she found him already standiig on the top of the ladder where she last saw him, he having effected his ingress and egress with such celerity, that but for the light fusil he now held in his hand, she would have believed herself mistaken in supposing he had entered at  all.              -       ; "Well, miss, I am waiting for your say so," he said, in a .ow tone, peering warily around him. "Have you been to the Court House to-night?" hesitatingly asked the other.  "Well, now," replied Bart, hesitating in his turn, " without more token for knowing what you're up to, I'll say, may be so, I and may be no so." "You need not fear me, Bart," replied Sabrey, conjecturing the cause of his hesitation; "I am no enemy of those who  have suffered there to-night. But do you know Mr. Wod.  burn                    *?  s  i   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       75 "Harry, who got you out of that river scrape? Yes; lived in his town last summer."  "He is among the wounded and prisoners in jail, it is said?" "Dreadful true, miss." "Could you get this small letter to him to-night?" she timidly asked. "Yes, through the grate; glad to do it, glad of it, twice over," replied Bart, reaching out and ,grasping the proffered billet. "Why, why do you say that?" asked Sabrey, with an air of mingled doubt and curiosity. '"Cause, in the first place, you'll now keep my secret of being here; and nextly, glad to find there's one among the court folks that feels decent about this bloody business. But I must be off. Yes, I'll get it to him," said Bart, beginning to descend. "Stay, Barty. Is there any hope that Mr. Woodburn will sur- vive his wounds?" "Survive? Live, do you mean? O, yes; though the lunge which that -  But no matter. It was well meant for the heart, and the fellow wan't at all to blame that it didn't reach it, instead of the inner part of the arm." "Indeed!" exclaimed Miss Haviland, in a tone of joyful sur- prise; which the next instant, however, gave way to one of embarrassment. "Why, I heard - have written, indeed, under the belief that -and perhaps -- Barty, I think, on the whole, I will not send that billet now." As Bart heard these last words df the fair speaker, so incon- sistent with all which both her words and manner had just ex- pressed, he looked up with a stare of surprise to her face, now sufficiently revealed, by the glancing light standing near her in'the room, to betray its varying expressions. But, as he ran his keen gray eyes over her hesitating and slightly confused countenance, he soon seemed to read the secret cause of her sudden change of purpose, arising from that curious and beautiful trait in:::- woman's heart, which, by some gush of awakened sympathy, often unfolds all the lurking secrets of the Ibreast, but which,- when the cause of that sympathy is removed, closes up the avenue, and conceals them from view, in the cold reserve of shrinking delicacy -the colder and more impenetrable in propor- tion as the disclosure has been complete. "O0, yes, I will carry it," said Bart, pretending to misunder- stand the other, while he. pocketed the billet and began to glide* down the ladder, o /   76          THE RANGERS, 'e No," commenced Miss Hayiland ; " no, Bart, I said -- " "Yes, yes, I will have it there in a jiffy," interrupted Bart, hastening his descent, and the next instant dodging away it' the dark beneath the foot of the ladder. ,' Well, let it go," said the foiled and somewhat mortified maiden to herself, after the disappea'Mhce of her strange visitor. , Ifi what I expressed, when I thought him dying, was right and proper, it cannot be very wrong now." As soon as she had thus reconciled herself to the unexpected turn which this matter had taken, Miss Haviland now began to reflect more on Bart's motives in coming, at such an hour of the night, for his gun; when it, for the first time, occurred to her mind, that he had been induced to take this step in consequence of some particular call for arms having reference to the events of the evening. Fearing she might have done wrong in suffering him to take away the gun, if it was to be used for hostile purposes, and anxious to know whether her conjectures relative to a rising of the people were well founded, she proceeded to an end win- doyr of her room, which overlooked a range of buildings known to her to be mostly occupied by the opposers of royal authority; and removing the curtains and raising the sash, she leaned out and listened for any unusual sounds which might reach her from Without. And it was not long before she became well convinced that her apprehensions were not groundless. Some extraordinary movement was evidently going on in the village. The low hum of suppressed voices, mingled with various sounds of busy prepa- ration, came up, on the dense night air, from almost every direc- tion around her. Here, was heard the smallhammler, the grating file, with the occasional clicking of the fireloclndergoing repairs by the use of the instruments just named. ie, could be 3is- tinguished the- pecking of flints, the rattling ofrods, .and the regularly repeated rapping of bullet-moulds to'sengage the freshy-cast balls. In other places could be perc e hasty movements of men about the stables, evidently engaged in lead- ing out and saddling horses, and making other preparations for mounting; and then followed the sounds of the quick, short gallop of their steeds, starting off, on express, in various directions, under the sharply applied lashes of excited riders, and distinctly revealing their different routes out of the village, by the streams of fire that flew from their rapidly striking hoofs on the gravelly and! frozen ground. All, indeed, seemed to be in silent commno- tion through the town. Bart's object in coming for his gun, at such an hour of the night, was now Sufficiently explained; for   OR THE TORYkS DAUGHTER.        " the quick and discerning mind of Miss Haviland at once told her that the country was indeed rising in arms to avenge the atrocities just committed by the party among whom were all her relatives and- friends; and she shuddered at the thought of tl. morrow, feeling, as she did, a secret and boding consciousness that their downfall, brought about by their arrogance and crimes, was now at hand. 7' li I   Ma          THE RANGERS, CHAPTER   VII. "A shout as of waters - a long-uttered cry: Hark! hark! how it leaps from the earth to the sky  From the sky to the earth, from the earth to the sea, It is grandly reechoed, We arefree, we arefree!  EVERY thing, the next morning, seemed as quiet and peacef I in the village, as if nothing unusual had occurred there. The coqm o- iton of the preceding night appeared to have wholly subsided. Vith such secrecy and caution, indeed, had the revolutionists managed, that no knowledge of their movements had yet reached the ears of anyof their opponents. And so guarded was their conduct, through the whole morning, that the court party leaders, although their spies had early been out, prowling round the whole village, were yet kept in entire ignorance of all that had transpired arrong the former during the night. Being consequently deceived by the false appearance which every thing within the reach of their observation had been made to wear, and feeling thus relieved of their last night's guilty fears of a popular outhreak, these cruel and dastardly minions of royalty now counted on their triunph as complete; and, soon giving way to noisy exultation, they began openly to boast of the sanguinary measure by which their supposed victory had been achieved. And, about nine o'clock in the forenoon, the judges and officers of court, with a select num- -ber of their most devoted adherents, all in high spirits, and wholly unsuspicious of the storm that was silently gathering around them, formed a procession at the house of Brush, and, attended by a strong armed escort, marched ostentatiously through the street to the Court House, and entered the court- room to commence the session. After the judges had been ushered to their seats, and while they were waiting for the crowd to enter and settle in their places, Chandler, who had kept aloof till the procession had begun to form, was seen to run his wary and watchful eye several times over the assembly, to ascertain whether there were any discover- able indications there pointing to any different state of, things from the one so confidently assumed by his confederates, when he soon appeared to have noted some circumstance which caused him suddenly to exchange the bland smile he had been wearing for a look of thoughtfulness and concern.   OR THe, TORY'S DAUGHTER. 4' Do you notice &ny thing unusual in the crowd this morning, Judge Sabin?" he said to his colleague, in an anxious whisper,  as he closed his scr. tiny.  . "( No, your honor," replied the other, " unless it be the cheer- ing sight of encountering none but friendly faces, instead of the hostile ones, which a man would have been led to expect to meet here, after so much clamor about popular disaffection. "Ay," responded the former, with a dubious shake of the head - " ay, but that is the very circumstance that puzzles me. Had a portion of the assembly been made up of our opponents, quietly mingling with the rest, as I had rather hoped, I should have construed it into a token of submission; or, had a committee been here to present a petition, or a remonstrance or two, I should have been prepared for that, and could have managed, by a little 'encouragement, and a good deal of delay, to give every troublesome thing the go-by, till- the storm had blown over. But this entire abserce of the disaffected looks a little suspicious, don't it?" "Why, no," answered the stiff and stolid Sabin; "I can see nothing suspicious about it. Indeed, it goes to show me that the rebellion is crushed; for, as I presume, the honest but well- meaning part of the rebels are ashamed, and their leaders afraid' to show their faces here to-day, after last night's lesson." "I hope it may be as you suppose ; but I have my doubts in the matter," returned Chandler, with another dissenting shake of the head, as he tirned away to renew his observations on the company before him. On resuming his scrutiny, the uneasy judge soon perceived that the assembly, during his conversation with his colleague, had received an accession of several individuals, whom he recog- nized as belonging to the party whose absence had awakened his suspicions. But the presence of these persons, after he had carefully noted their appearance, instead- of tending to allay, only went to confirm, his apprehensions; -for, as he, closely scanned the bearing and countenance of each, and marked the assured and determined look and covert smile which. spoke of anticipated triumph, attended with an occasional expectant glance through the windows, he there read, with the- instinctive sagacity sometimes seen in men of his cast of characteri enough to. convince him, with what he had previously observedithat-:a movement of a, dangerous magnitude was somewhere: in-progresa and soon to be developed against the court partys And- hae ia, stantly resolved, to;. lose- no time bebfore trimmiag hisi sails..and   80          THE RANGERS, preparing to meet the coming storm.

He then proceeded to remark on the unfortunate occurrences of the previous night, with a show of much feeling and regret, and concluded by expressing his disapprobation of the course taken in the affair by the sheriff and his abettors, in a manner that would have given the highest offence to all implicated, had they not believed that the speech was secretly designed only as a game on their opponents, whom he might think it expedient to quiet and delude a little longer. They, therefore, winked know- ingly to each other, and remained silent; while the speaker sat down with the mental exclamation, - "There, let it come now! That speech will do to be quoted. I can refer them to it as the public expression of my views before I knew what was coming." Having thus placed himself in a position, as he believed, where he could easily turn himself to meet any contingency,- where, in case the apprehended overthrow of the court party took place, he could easily and safely leap the next hour to a favorable, if not a high stand among the new dispensers of place and power, or where, should the present authorities be able to sustain them- selves, he could as easily explain away his objectionable doings, and retain his standing among them. Having done this, he then turned his attention to the official duties of his place, and ordered the crier to give the usual notice, that the court was now open for business. This being formally done, the court docket was called over, and the causes there entered variously disposed of for the time being, by the judges, till they came to that of Wood- burn versus Peters; which was a petition for a new trial for the recovery of the petitioner's alleged farm, that had been decided, at the preceding term, to be the property of Peters, on the ground and in the manner mentioned in a former chapter. "Who answers for this Woodburn?" said Sabin, with a con- temptuous air. Significant glances were exchanged among the tory lawyers and officers about the bar at the question, and a malicious smile stole over the features of Peters, who had found a seat among them. "I move the court," said Stearns, the attorney of Peters, " for a judgment in favor of my client for his costs, and also for a writ of possession of his land, of which he has been so unjustly kept out by this vexatious proceeding. And, as the petitioner has not entered his- appearance according to rule, whereby he tacitly   OR THE TORY? PAOGHTER.  admits that his ,cause cannot be sustained, I will not permit my- seif to doubt that the court will so order, even at this early hour - they certainly have the power to do so." "They have also the power to postpone the hearing, even to the last day of the term, before rendering judgment," bluntly inter- posed Knights, a large, plain-looking practitioner at the bar, who had taken no active part either for or against the court party. "We all know how this young man is debarred from appearing here to-day ; and it seems to me manifestly unjust that any power which deprives a man of the opportunity of appearing at court, should render judgment against him in consequence of his ion- appearance. I would, therefore, suggest a delay in this cause. Perhaps, within a short time, he will employ counsel, or be liber- ated." :"And perhaps be hung for treason," said Stearns, in a sneer- ing under-tone. "'Do you answer for him or not, Mr. Knights?" demanded Sabin, impatiently. "No, your honor; he has not authorized me. I only made a suggestion," answered the former. 4"Then judgment must go for Peters," rejoined Sabin, with ill suppressed warmth. "Traitors and rebels must look some- where else for favor, beside this court, while I hold a seat here." 4 Nobody has yet been convicted of treason, I believe," promptly responded Knights, while an expression of indignant scorn flashed over his manly and intelligent countenance; " and till such is the case, I take it the rights of all have an equal. claim on the court. I should be pleased to hear the opinion of the chief justice in this matter." "Although I may have my doubts on this subject, Mr. Knights," graciously replied Chandler, '" you could hardly expect me to be guilty of so great a discourtesy ito my colleague here, as to inter- fere, after the intimation he had just given." 1 Make the entry, Mr. Clerk," said Sabin, hastily; "judgment for costs, and a writ of possession. I am .not troubled with any doubts in the matter, and will take the responsibility of the de- cision." Scarcely was the cause thus decided before Peters glided up to the clerk, and whispered in his ear; when the latter, nodding assentingly, opened his desk, and taking out -two nicely-folded papers, handed them slyly to the other, who, receiving them in the same manner, immediately left the court-room and proceeded down stairs. As the exulting suitor passed through the crowd   8U     .     THE RANGERS, gathered round the main entrance, he beckoned to a short, thick- set, harsh-featured fellow, who immediately followed him around a corner of the building. "Well, Fitch," said Peters, pausing as soon as they were out of the reach of observation,-" have you done up your business in town, so as to be ready for a start for g'uilford?" "Yes; don't know but I have. But you can't have got your decision, papers made out, and all, so soon as this?" replied the other.                       , "All complete!" returned Peters, triumphantly. "Why, the court has not been in; session an hour!" "True, but I had spoken to Judge Sabin to have my case taken up this morning; and, as nobody was authorized to answer for Woodburn, the case was disposed of in a hurry. And the clerk, with whom I had also arranged matters, had made out the papers before going into court, and got them all signed off and ready, in anticipation; and here they are, ready for your hands, Mr. Con- stable."  "Ay, I see; but what is the necessity of serving them so im. mediately?" "Why, there's no knowing what may happen, Fitch. If the rebels, in revenge for last night's peppering, should send over the mountain for old Ethan Allen and his gang to come here to stir up and lead on the disaffected, all legal proceedings might be stopped. I know most of our folks think, this morning, that the enemy are fairly under foot. But Chandler, who is as keen as a fox for smelling out trouble, acts to me as-if he was frightened; and I think he must have scented mischief brewing, some. where." "Some say he is a very timorsome man." "Yes; but watchful and sagacious, and therefore an index not to be disregarded." "May be so. But what are your orders about these papers?" "With this, the writ of possession, go, in the first place, and turn the old woman, his mother, neck and heels, from the house; and then get some stiff fellow in for a tenant, rent free the first year, if you can do no better, provided he will defend the prem-, ises against Woodburn, if he escapes unhung. And with this paper, an execution for costs, as you will see, seize the fellow's cow and oxen, and all else you can find, and sell them as soon as the law will let you."                   i "Why, you won't leave enough of the fellow fora grease spot!" "-Blast him ; I don't intend to. But now is the time to do it, i        "  !  ',    OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       83 before he can get out of jail and back there to give fight and trouble us. So you fix all these matters about right for me, Fitch, and I'll do the handsome thing by yo4 when I come over, after the roads get sttled, in the spring." "Never fear me, as long as I know what a friend's wishes are," replied the constable, with a significant wink, as he stuffed the docume nts into his hat, and bustled off on the detestable mis- sion of his more detestable employer. While Peters and his official minion was thus engaged, Tom Dunning was seen coming, with hasty strides, along the road from the direction of his cabin, which was situated without the village, abo t a half mile north of the Court House, from which it would haLve been visible but for the pine thicket by which it was partially enclosed. As the hunter was entering the village, he met Morris, hastening up the street, from the opposite part of the town. "Well niet," said Morris; " for I was bound to your quarters with a mess age, which "Which Iam    ditter ready to receive, and give you one, which I stared to carry to your folks, in return. So, first for yours." "Mine is that we are now  drawn up, two hundred strong, in   i the first wo tds south of the village, and are ready to march." "And  tmine, that we are der ditto; besides being a hun. tred better than you, all chafing, like ditter tied-up dogs, to be let on." "I will b ck, then, to my post ith the news; and in less than thalf hour, tell them, they shall hear our signal of entering the I rillage, as a reed, which we will expect you to answer, and then ush on, as  st as you please, to effect a junction, as we wheel to the court-yard. But stay: have the prisoners been apprized hat their de iverance is at hand ?" "Yes; I   Fran up at the time the  court ditter went in, and, i n the bustle got a chance to tell them  through the grate." "All righ ;  but how are the wounded doing  "Ditter  w11el, except French, who is fast going." "Indeed! Poor fellowl! But his blood will now soon be  venged," said Morris, as the'two now separated and hastened ack to their respective posts. After Peters had despatched the constable on his work of legal  under and revenge, he returned to the court-room for the pur. Dse of pres ing to a hearing some other cases which he had emnding agai st political opponents, and which he hoped, through    84-          THE RANGERSl the favor of a-biased and corrupt court, to carry as easily as;the oled wherein he had just so wickedly triumphbed. But he was not permit ted to reap any more of his despicable advantages; for he found that another, actuated by motives no less unworthy than his own, had already gained the attention of the court to a case of which he had been- the prime mover and complainant. This was Secretary Brush ; and the trial he had ibeen urging on, through Stearns, thie acting state's attorney, was that of the alleged murderer, to whose somewhat mysterious, as well as suspicious, arrest and im- prisonment allusion has already been made.       i "As you say the witnesses are in court, Mr. Stearns," observed Chandler, after a moment's consultation with his colleague, " es all the witnesses are here, iwe have concluded to take up the criminal case in question. iYou may therefore direct the sheriff to bring the prisoner into court without delay." The sheriff, accordingly, left the court-room, and, in a short time, reappeared with the prisoner, followed by two armed -men, who closely guarded and conducted him forward to the crimi- nal's box. The prisoner was a man of the apparent age of sixty, of rather slight proportions of body, but with a large head, and coarse fea- tures, that seemed to be kept almost constantly in play by a lively, flashing countenance, in w i h meekness and fire, kindness and austerity, were curiously blended. As he seated himself, he turned round and faced the court with a fearless and even scorn- ful air, but promptly rose, alt the bidding of the chief judge, to listen to the information, 'which the clerk proceeded to read against him at length, closing by addressing to the respondent the usual question as to his guilt or innocence of the charge. I once," calmly respond d the prisoner - I once knocked up a pistol,. pointed at my ibrea t by a robber. It went off and killed one of his fellows, and -- " "Say, guilty or not guilty'?" sternly interrupted the clerk. i "Not guilty, then," answered the other, determined, while going through these prelirrinary forms, that his accusers, the court, and audience, should Eear what, under other circumstances, he would have reserved for -he more appropriate time of making his defence, or left to his counsel. "Ay, not guilty; and that gentleman," he rapidly continued, pointing, to Brush, '-'that gentje- man, who has offered to free me if I would subnmit to be robbed., well knows the truth of what I say. The witnessed, whom he hhas: suborned, also know it, if they know any thing about that luck-- less affray.,"   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       85 I   "Liar!" shouted Brush, springing up, in high excitement, as soon as he could recover from the surprise and confusion into to  which this bold and unexpected charge had thrown him. k " q: The man's insane - evidently insane,. your honors!" cried Stearn, who, in his anxiety to shield his friend Brush, thought I not of the effect of such a remark. "I thank the attorney for the government for that admission, may it please the court," said Knights, rising, with a sarcastic ;i glance at Stearns. "I may wish to make use of it." ct.  "Are you counsel for the prisoner, sir?" sharply demanded !(!,t the other. *:g  c"I am, sir," coolly'replied Knights; "and you may find, be- :i'i fore we get through the trial, that what the prisoner has said, as much out of place as it was, is not the only truth to be devel- oped. But before the case proceeds any further, I ofler a plea to the jurisdiction of this court, and at once submit, whether a man can be tried here for an offence alleged to have been committed i another county, without a special order from the governor for that purpose." !"That order is obtained and on file, sir. So that learned bubble is burst, as will all the rest you can raise in favor of the miserable ,;: 1 wretch you have stooped to defend," said Stevens, exultingly. i "Mr. Clerk, pass up that order to the court." 'i {"Are you satisfied now, Mr. Knights?" asked Sabin, with undignified' feeling, after glancing at the order which had been laid !; before the judges. "Mr. Stearns, proceed with the cause." But that court, on whom the subservient attorney and his cor- rupt and arrogant friend depended to convict an innocent man of an infamous crime, that a pr'vate and nefarious object might :  thL reby be enforced --that court were now destined to be ar- re jted in their career of judicial oppression before they had time to; add another stain to their already blackened characters: for, atilthis moment, a deep and piercing groan, issuing from one of th: prison-rooms beneath, resounded through the building so ferfully distinct, as to cause every individual of the assembly to stt rt, and even to bring the judges and officers of the court to a de d pause in their proceedings. A moment of death-like silence i  ensued; when another and a sharper groan of anguish, bursting evidently from the .same lips, and swelling up to the highest , co npass of the human voice, and ending in a prolonged screech ofi mortal agony, rang through the apartment, sending a thrill of h rror to the very hearts of the appalled multitude! Who? What? For God's sake, what is that?" exclaimed   bt    v      THE RANGERS, a dozen eager and trembling voices at once, as nearly the whole assembly started to their feet, and stood with amazed and per- plexed countenances, inquiringly gazing at each other. "Don't your consciences tell you that?" exclaimed the pris. oner, Herriot, in a loud, fearless voice, running his stern, indignant /eye over the court, its officers, and leading partisans around the bar. "Don't your consciences tell you what it was? Then I will! It was the death-screech of the poor murdered French, whose tortured spirit, now beyond the reach of your power, went out with that fearful cry which has just assailed your guilty ears!" "Mr. Sheriff! Mr. Sheriff!" sputtered Sabin, boiling with wrath, and pointing menacingly to the prisoner. "Silence, there, blabbing miscreant!" thundered Patterson. "Ah I No wonder ye want silence, when that name is mnen. tioned," returned Herriot, unflinchingly. Struck dumb with astonishment at the unexpected audacity of the prisoner in thus throwing out, in open court, such bold and cutting intimations of their guilty conduct, the judges and officers seemed perfectly at a loss how to act, or give vent to their mad- dened feelings, for some moments. Soon, however, the most prompt and reckless among them found the use of their tongues. "Shoot him  down, Patterson!" exclaimed Brush, with an oath. "Treason! I charge him with treason, and demand that he be ironed and gagged on the spot!" shouted Gale, bringing down his clinched fist heavily on the desk before him! "Yes, high treason; let us. re-arrest him, and see if we can hang him on that, should he escape on the other charge," chimed in Stearns. "I have my doubts," began Chandler, who was growing every moment more wavering and uneasy. "No doubts about it," interrupted Sabin, almost choking with rage.  I'll not sit here and see the king's authority insulted, and his court treated with such contempt and treasonable defiance; and I order him instantly in irons-- chains-yes, chains, Mr. Sheriff!" "You can chain the body, but shall not fetter the tongue," responded Herriot, in no way dismayed by the threats of his enraged persecutors, or their preparations to confine and torture his person; L" for I will speak, and you shall hear, ye tyrants! Listen then, ye red-handed assassins! The blood of your mur- dered victim has cried up to God for vengeance. The cry has.   tI   I     -  OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       87  bed heard'! the unseen hanC has already traced your doom oi the wall! and this day, ay, within this hour," he 'continued, gancing through the window to a dark mass of men, who might now be partially discerned drawn up behind the point of woods nr a? a the north--"ay, within this very hour, that doom shall be fifilled! Hark!" he added, ir. startling tones, after a momentary pause -" hark! do ye hear those signal guns, echoing from post to ppst, round your beleaguered Babylon? Do. you hear those s louts? The, avengers of blood are even now at your doors. i ear, and tremble!" ; Al the speaker closed his bold denunciations, he descended from the bench which he had mounted for the purpose, and, ad- v mling to the sheriff and his assistants, now standing mute and d butful with their hastily pfccured fetters in their hands, he p tused, and stood confronting ;hem with an ironical smile, and ith folded arms, in token of his readiness now to submit himself t t eir hands. But a wonderful change had suddenly come :  oert the whole band of these tory dignitaries. The dark and a. gry scowls of meditated revenge, and the more fiery expres- ; si ns of undisguised wrath, which were bent on the dauntless old -   an n- during the first part of his denunciations, had, by the time g  h made his closing announcement, all given way to looks of s rprise and apprehension. No one offered to lay hands on him; 'r, for, as the truth of what he said was every moment more strongly "nfirmed by the increasing timult without, no one had any ;a  thloughts to spare for any but himself. And soon the whole assernbly broke from their places, and, in spite of the loud calls of the officers for silence and order, began to cry out in eager in luiries, and run about the room in the utmost confusion and !Ii aal rm. At this juncture, Davic Redding, who had been thus far th roost reckless and bloodthirsty tory of all, burst into the room, h rriedly exclaiming,-             . r:  "F' The people have risen in arms, and are pouring in upon us, b hundreds, from every direction! In five minutes this house w 1l be surrounded, and we in their power. Let every man look- to his own safety! I shall to mine," he added, rushing back dwn to the, front door, where, instead of attempting to escape  E th ough the back way, as he might then have done, he began to I sh ut, "Hurra for Congress!" and, "Down with the British "rt!" at-the very top of his voice. I resign my commission," cried Chandler, jumping up in  grattrepidation. 6 Let it be distinctly understood," he repeated, raising his voice in his anxiety to be heard -" yes, let it be- dis, :  L!   88       .   THE RANGERS, tinctly understood, that I have resigned my commission as judge of this court." "D----n him! what does he mean by that?" muttered Gale, turning to Patterson. "It means he is going to turn tail, as I always thought he Mwould, -the cursed cowardly traitor!" replied the latter, gnashing his teeth. "But let him, and that pitiful poltroon of a Redding, go where they please. We will see to matters ourselves. I don't believe it is any thing more than a mere mob, who will scatter at the first fire. So follow me, Gale; and all the rest of ye, that aint afraid of your own shadows, follow me, and I'll soon know what can be, done." And, while lawyers and suitors were hastily snatching up their papers, and all were making a general rush for the door, in the universal panic which had seized them, the boastful sheriff, attended by his assistants and the tiger-tempered Gale, pushed his way-down stairs, shaking -his sword over his head, and shout- ,ing with all his might, "To arms![i Every friend to the court and king, to arms! Stand to your guns there below, gaards, and shoot down every rebel that attempts to enter!" But, when he reached the front entrance, the spectacle which there greeted his eyes seemed to have an instant effect in cooling his military ardor. There, to his dismay, he beheld drawn up, within thirty paces of the door, an organized and well-armed body of more than three hundred men; while small detachments, constantly arriving, were falling in on the right and left, and extending the wings round the whole building. And as the dis- comfited loyalist ran his eye along the line of the broad-breasted and fierce-looking fellows before him, and recognized among them the Huntingtons, the Knights, the Stevenses, the Baileys, the Brighams, the Curtises, and other stanch and leading patriots, from nearly every town bordering on the Connecticut, and saw the determined look and the indignant flashing of their counte- nances, he at once read not only the entire overthrow of his party in this section of the country, but the individual peril in which he, and his abettors in the massacre, now stood before an outraged and excited populace. "What ails your men, Squire Sheriff?" cried Barty Burt, now grown to a soldier in the ranks of the assailants, as he pointed tauntingly to the company of tory guards who had been stationed irl the yard, but who now, sharing in the general panic, had thrown down their arms, and stood huddled together near   I   !

We have come here on a business which neither long speecles nor smooth ones will prevent us from executing." rh judge, however, could not afford to take this as a repulse; an, with this doubtful license, he went on to say, that on hearing, in ihe morning, as he did with astonishment and horror, of the unliutiorized proceedings of last night,. he had denounced the to ourage, in an address at, the opening of the court; and not f . fin ing himself supported, he had resigned, and left his seat on the bench. And now," he added in conclusion, " being freed from the tramnmels of my oath of office; which have lately become so pain- ful to me, I feel myself again one of the people, and stand ready to cooperate with them in any measure required by the public welfare." A very faint and scattering shout of applause, in two or three places, mingled with hisses and murmurs in others, was the only response with which this address was received. But even with this equivocal testimony of public feeling towards him, this despi-   cable functionary felt gratified. "I am safe," said he to himself, ij." with a long-drawn breath, as he descended the steps, to watch an opportunity to mingle with the party with whom he was now especially anxious to be seen, and to whom he was ready to say, in the words of the satirist,-  I'm all submission, what you'd have me, make me; The only question is, sirs, will you take me?" At -his moment a sash was thrown up, and the prisoner, Her. riot, appeared at a window of the court-room above. 8   90          THE RANGERS, "I have been brought up here this morning," he said, shaking back his gray locks, and raising his stern, solemn voice to a pitch clearly audible to all in the grounds below-"I have been brought here from my dungeon to answer to the charge of a foul crime ; and both my accusers and triers, fleeing even before any one appeared to pursue, have left their places, having neither tried nor condemned me. But scorning to follow their example, I now* appear, to submit myself for a verdict, to the rightful source of all power-the people." "Neither will we condemn thee," cried Knowlton, pursuing the scriptural thought of the other; " if thy accusers and judges have left thee uncondemned, thou shalt [not be condemned by us; at least not by me, who have long had my opinions of the charac- ter of this prosecution." "As also have I," responded Captain Wright. "I know some- thing of the witnesses, on whom, it is said, they depended to convict father Herriot; and I would notl hang a dog on their testi- mony. I move, therefore, that we hereb pronounce a verdict of acquittal. Who says, ay?" "Ay!" promptly responded a dozen voices; and "Ay!" the next instant rose in one loud, unanimojs shout from the whole multitude. "A thousand thanks to you, my fr'ends, for your generous confidence in my innocence," returned the old man with emotion; "and, thank God, your confidence is not misplaced. I was for- rerly guilty of much, which has cost me many bitter tears of repentance; but there is no blood on Tmy hands, and I will now return to my hermit hut, from which they dragged me, there to pray for the success of the good cause in which you are engaged, leaving to you what lesson shall be taught those Hamans who have filled these dungeons with the dying and wounded, now de- manding your care."  The effect of the old man's closing hint was instantly visible on the multitude, who decided by acclamation to act upon it without delay; and accordingly a score of resolute fellows were detached to proceed to the' prisons, release their friends, and fill their places, for the present, with their murderous oppressors. with t h eir murderous oppressi l1 r. 4     11   OR THE. TOY'S DAUGOHTEB.       9- CHAPTER YIII. "- ---- right represt, Will heave with the deep earthquake's fierce unrest, Then fling, with fiery strength, the mountain from its breast." WHEN the besieged tories, who were now mostly crowded together in the broad space on the lower floor, saw a column of- their assailants entering the front door, and advancing upon them with levelled muskets to sacrifice them, as they supposed, on the'. spot, they where seized with a fresh and uncontrollable panic, and made such a tremendous rush for the back entrance, that the only sentry who happened at that moment to be there, was, in spite of all his threats to fire upon them, instantly borne down, or thrust aside, by the i ving torrent that now burst through the door; and before a force sufficient to stop them could reach the spot, I-  numbers had escaped into the adjoining fields, where, scattering I(  in d(ifferent directions, they commenced their disorderly flight, iwith all the speedi which their guilty terrors could lend them. The next moment, lowever, as the cry that the tories were es- caping was raised, a hundred of their most fleet-footed opponents were seen leaping the fences into the fields, and giving chase to the frightened fugitives. A scene, in which the ludicrous, the novel, the wild, and the fearful, were strangely mingled, now en- sued; for, althoukL a strong guard still retained their places round the Court Hbuse, who, with the detachment that had en- tered as we have described, proceeded to take into custody the remaining tories and[ liberate the imprisoned, yet the main body i   of the revolutionists joined in the work of hunting down the flying enemy; those not dnly who had escaped from the Court House in the manner we have named, but all concerned in the massa- cre that could be found secreted or lurking about the village; while the exulting shouts of the victors as, they overtook, seized, and brought to the ground the vanquished; the' abject cries of the latter for quarter; the ieports of muskets fired by pursuers I over the heads of the pursued, to frighten them to surrender; the beating of drums, and the loud clamor of mingling voices, all combined to swell the uproar and confusion of the exciting scene. "H ow like the ditter deuse these lawyers do scratch grav-   TH 1'1; IIANNERS2 [I " exclaimed Tom Dunning, as he single out and gave chase Stearns and Knights, who together were making their way cross the fields, in the direction of the river, as if life and death ung on their speed. ' Ha! ha!" continued the tickled hunter,  Lughing so immoderately at the novel. spectacle, as greatly to im.  ede his own progress--" ha! ha! ha! h! Why, I der don't e elieve but what they've got consciences, after all! for what else  )uld make their ditter drumsticks fly so?" But although the hunter, in thuis indulging his merriment, suf- ,red himself actually to lose ground in the race, yet he had no )tion of relinquishing the chase, or losing the game; for, con- ious of his own powers, and thinking lightly of those of the gitives, he supposed, that, as soon as he chose to exert himself, l could easily make the race a short one, and as easily capture id lead them back in triumph; and he began to think oyer the kes he would crack at their expense on the way. But the un- en event of the next moment showed him, to his vexation, that s inaction, and confidence in his own powers to remedy the nsequences of it, had cost him all the anticipated pleasures of s expected victory. For scarcely had he commenced the pur- it in earnest, when the fugitive lawyers reached the blank of e river, and at the very place too, as it provokingly happened, here his own log-canoe chanced to be moored, and hastiy leap- g into it, they managed with such dexterity and quickness, in Lndling the oars and cutting the fastenings; as to push off, and t fairly out of the reach of their pursuer, before hcould gain e spot; and his threat to fire at them, if they did not return, i d the execution of that threat the next moment, which sent a llet skipping over the water within a foot of the receding canoe, he'only intended, were all without effect in compelling the turn of the panic-struck attorneys. And the balked pursuer had Dn the mortification to see his crafty brace of intended captives id in safety-on the opposite shore, which he had now no means gaining, and disappear in the dark pine forest then lining the stern bank of the Connecticut at this place. "Outwitted, 3y ditter Judas!" exclaimed the hunter, in his xation. "TI ese lawyers, dog 'em! they have so much of the  d Scratcher in 'em, that they will outdo a fellow at his owr trade. )wever, I've done the new state some ditter service, I reckon, ling I've fairly driven such a precious pair of 'em out of it." * ^IKnights, who, unlike his companion, was no loyalist, appears to . d re become infected with the panic that had seized his loyal associates,   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.         93  With this consolatory reflection, he now turned and retraced  his steps towards the scene of action. While on his way thither, and soon after passing the rear of the building - before described as the head-quarters of the tory leaders, his attention was arrested^ by the lamentable outcries of some -one alternately bawling for help, and begging for mercy ; when, turning to the spot, he there beheld his associate, Barty Burt, astride the haughty owner of the mansion just named, who, with dress sadly soiled and disor- dered, was creeping on his hands and knees on the ground, towards ( his house, which, it appeared, he had nearly gained, when he was overtaken, thrown to the ground, and mounted by his agile and tormenting captor, who was now taking his whimsical revenge,  for former indignities, by compelling the fallen secretary, through the efficacy of a loaded pistol just wrenched from the latter's hand, to carry him on his back, in the manner above described. "What the dogs are you ditter doing there, Bart?" said Dun- ning, with a broad grin, as he came up and recognized the sec- retary in such a strange plight and attitude.  in common with the whole-court party; and, though he had no cause for alarm, fled with those who escaped from the Court House, on this memo-  rable occasion, It is probable, that owing to his supposed interest in the  continuance of the court, and consequent unwillingness to cooperate in  the measures on foot to overthrow it, he was purposely kept in ignorance of the movements of the revolutionists, and therefore taken wholly by surprise when the storm burst. At all events, his speedy return, imme-  diate resumption of his professional duties at Brattleborough, and subse- quent promotion to the bench, abundantly shows that he no less enjoyed the confidence of the American party than his two namesakes, and, we believe, relatives, whom we have named as present among the assailants,  and who were afterwards officers in our revolutionary forces. An aged  and distinguished early settler, to whom the author is indebted for many  of the incidents he has here delineated, thus writes in relation to the par- ticular ohe in question- .  "I have heard Judge Samuel Knights, who, as chief justice, presided in the Supreme Court from 1791 to 1793, describe the trepidation that seized them, when, after the massacre, and on the rising of the surround- ing country, they came to learn the excited state of the populace. He related how he and another member of the bar (Stearns, I think, who was afterwards attorney secretary of Nova Scotia) hurried down to the river, and finding there a boat, (such as was used in those times for carrying seines or nets at the shad and salmon fishing grounds, which were fre-  quent on both sides the river, below the Great Falls,) they paddled them-  selves across, and lay all day under a log in the pine forest opposite the town; and, when night came, went to Parson Fessenden's, at Walpole,j and obtained a horse, 'so that, by riding and tying, they got out of the country till the storm blew over, when Knighta returned to Brattle,1 borough."   "O, nothin very desput; only showing Squire Brush, here, the differ between to-day and yesterday, that's all," replied Bart, kicking and spurring, like a boy on some broken-down horse. ' Get up, here! Gee! whoa, Dobbin! Kinder seems to me," he continued to his groaning prisoner--" kinder seems to me I heard somebody say, 'tother night, that Bart Burt wasn't above a jackass. Worder if I aint above a jackass now? only his ears may need pul ing and stretching a little," he added, suiting the action to the word. "For God's sake, my good man," said Brush, turning im- ploringly to Dunning, " do relieve me from The clutches of this insatiate imp of hell. Let him shoot me, it he will; bat don't leave me to be worried, and trod into the mud and splosk, like'a dog, by the revengeful young savage. It is more than flesh and" blood can bear." Well, now, squire, I wouldn't make such a tearing fuss about this little bit of a walloping, after what's happened, if I was you," said Bart. "There was our differ about who was the jack- ass, and sich lie, that night, you know, which I kinder thought I might as well settle; and then, again, there was your good-by, yesterday; but may be I've done enough to make that square, too. So I don't care if I let you up, now, seeing as how Mr. Dunning has come to take care of your worship," added the speaker, springing nimbly a few paces aside, and facing about with presented pistol, as if to keep the other on good behavior. "What can you want with me, sir?" said the disencumbered secretary to the hunter, after gaining his feet and shaking off the mud from his bedraggled garments. "Ditter considerable," replied the other. "In the first place, the people want to see you back to the Court House, where you may ditter consider yourself invited to go, under my care. They there may have the first claim on you.'" "Well, if I am a prisoner, let us go there, then," said the crestfallen loyalist, relinquishing, with bad grace, his hope of being allowed to escape. "But what do you mean byfirst claim on me?" i' "Well, I ditter mean that I have another, when they get through with you." "Explain yourself, sir." "I will. You ditter know that your governor has offered a reward of fifty pounds for the ditter delivery of Ethan Allen for the gallows, under a law got through the York Assembly, princi- pally by one Squire Brush. Well, I aint a going to ditter fight old ^. / *   p!          OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       95, - it Ethan's battles; for he can der do that himself. But you may 1"  ditter know, also, that Ethan has offered the same reward for the jI  governor and you. Now, as we are ditter expecting Allen over *(  here, in a few days, I was der thinking, I and Bart, here, might as well ditter deliver you up, and claim the money." * i  So saying, the hunter, bidding the prisoner to follow, and Bart I  to bring up the rear, marched off in triumph to the Court House; and, having delivered over his charge to the guard at the prison doors, sallied out into the village in quest of further adventures.   Nor was he long in meeting with them. After gaining the street, ,1 he soon perceived-a gathering and commotion nearly in front of #tuu the mansion whose owner he had just taken from the rear; and, ? :t on reaching the spot, he found a crowd collected round a sleigh,  filled with gentlemen and ladies, which proved to be that of Peters and his company. It appeared that Haviland, who had remained at his quarters that forenoon, and had thus become ap- ,a prised of the rising of the people sooner than the mass of his party, had instantly ordered the team to be harnessed, and every ;: thing prepared for an immediate departure, as soon as Peters   should arrive. And the latter, who was among those who broke away from the Court House after it was invested, having at length reached the house undiscovered, and adopted such disguise in dress as the time would permit, they had all jumped into the sleigh, (which could still be used better than any other vehicle,) and were rapidly driving from the yard, in an attempt to escape from the town, when they were recognized and detained by a party of the revolutionists. Haviland and Peters had already at S been seized and taken from the sleigh, and would have instantly been forced off to prison, but for the entreaties and distress of the females, who refused to be conducted back to the house, or even to be separated from their protectors; Miss Haviland, especially, declaring that if her father must go to prison, she would go with him. This had produced a momentary delay, during which a sharp altercation had arisen, some being for taking the prisoners back to the house, there to be guarded, and others strongly in- /i sisting on dragging them  off, at once, to jail. The latter, at length, appeared to prevail, and were on the point of forcing the I   * Crean Brush, who procured himself to be elected from this county (  to the New York legislature, for several years, was believed to be the main mover of the act of outlawry against Ethan Allen and others. He certainly, as chairman of the committee on the subject, reported, and  recommended the passage of, that notorious measure. [See Slade's State Papers.]   ladies, in spite of all their entreaties, from the sides of their protectors, when a man came pushing his way through the crowd: - "'For shame! shame! my friends," he cried; " you surely would not molest innocent and defenceless females." '"I will tell you what it is, Harry Woodburn," responded one of those who were for proceeding to active measures, " when ladies attempt to stand between murderers and their deserts, they must expect to be molested." The circumstances of the case were then explained to Wood- burn; when the crowd, who had been irritated by the threats and arrogant behavior of the prisoners, at the outset, again began to cry, "Away with them, women and all, if they will have it so- away with them to prison!"  "Men, hear me!" exclaimed Woodburn, planting himself between the ladies and the angry crowd. "You see this!" he continued, holding up his bandaged and blood-stained arm: " the wound was received in defending your cause; and I have but this moment come from the felon's hole, where I passed the night, for the part I took in the affray. Now, have I not earned the right to be heard?" ' c; Ay, ay, certainly, Harry ; gd on!" responded several, while the silence of the rest denoted a ready acquiescence in the request. "This, then, is what I woulI say," resumed the former. "t These ladies, who are doubtless anxious to escape from a scene of strife which may not yet be ended, came from a distance, under the care of this old gentleman, whose imprisonment would not only take from them their protector, but deprive them, proba- bly, of all present means of returning to their home. I propose, therefore, to let him and them depart unmolested." "If the ladies were all - but I don't know about letting this old fellow off so easily," said one, exchanging doubtful glances with those around him. "He is both tory and Yorker to the eyes." "Yes," urged another, " and who knows but he-was among the murderers last night?" 1"I have ascertained that he was not among the actors of last night's outrage," replied Woodburn. "Well," rejoined the former, "I know the other was--that upper-crust tory 'by his side there, who was always too proud to wear an old coat and hat, till he thought they might help him in skulking away out of the reach of punishment." e   iW      OR THE TORAYS DAUGHTER.       97 "I know Peters was there, to my cost; and I had no notion of asking any exemption for him," returned Woodburn, with bitter- ness. "But this old gentleman, whatever may be his feelings, has committed none of those acts of violence, for which, only, I understand, our leaders intend to institute trials. Shall we not, then, let him and his ladies proceed, as I proposed?" Receiving no direct answer to his appeal, the speaker now took two or three of the leading opposers aside, and, after conversing with them a few moments, returned, and announced to Haviland that he was at liberty to depart. ;I   How well and wisely had he read the human heart, who penned !  the scriptural apothegm, "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for, in so doing, thou shalt heap '",^ coals of fire on his head "! Haviland, though by nature an hon-   oraoble man, had yet suffered himself to enter deeply into the per. sonal animosities of Peters towards Woodburn, which, with his :i political and aristocratic prejudices, had caused him to think of the young man only with. feelings of contempt and bitterness. d And when he witnessed the noble conduct of the latter, first in rescuing his daughter from the flood, and now so generously in- terposing in his behalf, it produced that struggle between pride ]I  and conscience, whose operation is so forcibly expressed by the i  sacred writer just quoted. And, although he could bring himself to acknowledge his obligations only by a formal, and constrained bow, yet the conflicting and painful expressions that were seen flitting over his disturbed countenance, as he now returned to the g  sleigh, plainly told how effectually, and with what punished feel. ings, his enmity had been silenced. But not so with his single- minded and quickly and justly appreciating daughter. She had no prejudices to combat, no pride to conquer; and she, therefore, witnessed each new act of her deliverer with as much pleasure as gratitude- feelings which sought expression in no parade of words, it is true, but in the more meaning and eloquent language of the kindly tone and sweetly beaming countenance. And, in her low-murmured, "Thank you - thank you for all,' as Wood- burn handed her to her seat in the vehicle, he felt a thousand fold repaid for all he had ventured for her sake; while the speaking smile, with which she the next moment turned to him, and nodded her adieu, left an impress on his heart destined never to be effaced, While this was transpiring, Peters, who had been standing apart from the rest of his company, sullenly looking on, without uttering a word, except to bid Haviland go on without him, contrived, with. rH [*., s 9   BW I THE RANGERS, oit exciting any suspicion of his design, to work himself by de- grees to the outer edge of the crowd, in the direction in which the team was about to pass. And, as the sleigh, which was now pat in motion, approached him, he made a sudden feint of running the opposite way; when, as the crowd were confusedly springing forward to head him, he quickly tacked about, leaped into the sleigh, and, snatching the reins and whip from Haviland's hands, a plied the lash so furiously, that the frantic horses bounded for- ward with a speed which carried the receding vehicle more than fifty yards on its course, before the balked and confused throng could recover themselves, and fairly comprehend what had hap. pened. But the sharp, bitter shout of execrations, mingled with "ies for immediate pursuit, which now rose from the agitated multitude, proclaimed at once their hatred of the haughty loyalist, their determination not to suffer him to escape from justice. And the next instant, a half cozen swift runners, led on by Dun- ning, shot out from the crowd, in the eager chase, like so many arrows speeding to the mark. And, notwithstand ing the supposed advantages of horses over men in a race, and notwithstanding thy increased speed with which the fugitive team thundered along over the half-bare and uneven ground, the pursued had scarcely reached the end of a furlong, before the fleet and determined hunter, still in advance of his companions, gained the side of the sleigh, leaped up, pounced upon his cringing victim, and brought him headlong to the ground, leaving Haviland to seize the relin- quished reins, check the horses as he best could, and proceed on hid way unmolested. ", There! you citter sneak of a runaway tory. You will now go, I der rather calculate, where there's no diLter petticoats to shelter you," said Dunning, raising the chapfallen Peters by the collar, and drawing him along back, amidst the exulting shouts of the revolutionists, by whom ie and his friend Brush were then forced away, in no very gent e manner, to join their fellow-pris- or ers, in the same dungeon where the victims of their last night's outrage were so unfeelingly and so unwisely imrr ured. A detailed description of tee various scenes which here suc- ceeded, in the winding up of this local revolution, as it may justly be denominated, would occupy too much space for the limits of our tale, without evolving any further incident, having much bearing on the destinies of those of its personages whose fortunes we design to follow. We will now, therefore, sum up, in a few words, the doings of the triumphant party, and, with a comment- or two of our own, dismiss the subject.   OR THE TORYSS DAUGHTER.          99 In the first place, all the supposed actors and abettors of the massacre within reach were seized and secured, excepting Red- ding and one or two others of a like character, who, -by their activity in assisting to apprehend the fugitive comrades whom they had so meanly deserted, and their offers to give evidence against them, had purchased an exemption from punishment,' and excepting also the Janus-faced Chandler, who, by his duplicity, had contributed more than any other man, perhaps, towards this !   ;i catastrophe, but who now contrived to make even his iniquities h!"  ' count in his favor.*  After this was effected, the victors, all but enough to constitute a safe guard, laid aside their arms, and re. !\   solved themselves into a sort of civil convention, to take measures for the trial of the prisoners by some mode, which, in the absence of all proper authorities, should answer for a legal process. And, as the first step in the matter, a jury of inquest, to sit on the dead body of French, was ordered, and a committee appointed to see to the empanelling of impartial men, and collect evidence and conduct the investigations to be had before them. All this being *- As the acts of this notorious personage, whose character we have been at considerable pains to ascertain, and accordingly portray, will have no further connection with our story, we cannot forbear, before dismissing him entirely, giving the reader a short account of his subsequent career, and singular end. Although, by his facility of accommodating his politi- cal principles to those of the majority, and his alacrity of tacking about, and mounting, like a squirrel on a wheel, so as to be found rising to the top in every revolution or counter-revolution of public sentiment, he thus adroitly managed to get appointed to some offices of minor importance, under the new state government, yet, becoming every year better and bet- ter understood, and consequently more and more distrusted, he finally sunk into utter insignificance and contempt; and, falling into pecuniary embarrassments, brought about by a long course of secret fraud in selling wild lands, of which he had no titles, he was confined for debt in the very building in which the massacre occurred; 'where, as if by the retribution of Heaven for the part he once there acted, he soon died, unhonored and unlamented.   And, what is still more remarkable, his remains were strangely destined to be denied even the respect of- a common burial. For some exasperated creditor having attached the body, and the neigh- bors, from a notion that prevailed at that time, supposing, that by remov- ing the body for a public burial they would make themselves liable for his debts, suffered it to remain till it became too offensive to be endured, when, at the dark hour of midnight, a few individuals went silently to the prison, got the putrid mass into some rough box, and drew it on the ground to the fence of the neighboring burial-ground; and, having dug a horizontal trench under the fence, and a deep pit on the other side, pushed through and buried up all that remained of the once noted Chief Justice Chandler. An old, decayed oak stump, still standing, is the only object that marks the site of his grave.   1 0)         THE RANGERS, d ly accomplished, and the jury bringing in a verdict that the de- ceased came to his death by the discharges of muskets, in the imnds of Patterson, Gale, and others therein enumerated, all the litter, thus designated as the murderers of the unfortunate young wan, were taken, and, under the authority of another order or d cree of the convention, marched off, under a strong guard, to tle jail in Northampton, some forty or fifty mi'es into the inte- rior of Massachusetts, and there confined, to be tried for their lives at the next court that should be holden in the county where the offence was committed; while a less deeply imp icated portion of the prisoners were put under bonds to appear at the court to an- swer to the charges of manslaughter and assault, or made to un- dergo other punishments and restrictions immediately imposed by the convention.* The actors in the outrage, who comprised near. ly all the leading members of the British party in that part of the Grants lying east of the mountains, having beer thus summarily disposed of, the people, now taking the government into their own hands, and acting in primitive assembly, proceeded to reorganize the county, by the appointment of new judges, and all the usual subordinate officers, of their own principles, to adopt measures to reduce to submission or drive away the remaining loyalists of the county, and, finally, to declare themselves alike independent of the government of Great Britain and of New York. Thus terminated this memorable outhreak, which acquired additional importance from the fact, that it resulted in the entire subversion of British authority in this, the only section among the Green Mountains where it ever gained a foothold. And not small the praise, which, in view of the circumstances, should be awarded to the hardy spirits by whom this miniature revolution was achieved; for, so great was the power of patronage exercised by this court, and the influence of those enjoying office or immu- nities under it, -a great majority of whom were stanch, and the rest tacit, supporters of the royal cause, -that, till the occurrence of this sanguinary affair, it is evident the former -had but little * Among the different kinds of sentences imposed on the class of of- fenders here last named, was one dooming Judge Sabin to the limits of his own farm, and making it lawful for any one catching him off of it to kill him. And so deep was the public indignation against this inveterate loyalist and supposed secret abettor of the massacre, that he was narrowly watched for the chance of executing the penalty. An aged revolutionist, from whom this fact was derived, stated that he had lain many a Sunday, with a loaded rifle, in the woods near the judge's farm lines,.to see if he would not, when coming out to salt his sheep, stray over his limits. But the old fellow, he said, was always too wary for him.   OR TH TORY'S DAUGHTER.       101 hope of being able to overthrow this petty local dynasty without assistance from abroad. The aged survivors of that stormy period inform us, indeed, that but for the massacre of Westmin- ster, it would have been difficult to predict whether the opening of the revolution, a few months afterwards, would have found, in the section in question, a whig or tory majority predominating. But that act of murder and madness, which the loyalists here, with the strange infatuation attending their doings almost every where else at the time, seemed destined'to commit, as if to hasten their own overthrow, settled their doom. ( It was the electric flame to fire the hearts Of a true people." And while it opened the eyes of hundreds of the hitherto acquiescent, it armed the opposing with an energy and deter- mination in their cause, which at once became irresistible; and when the war-note was subsequently sounded by such patriots as Benjamin Carpenter and his associates, it found a ready response in every glen and corner of the surrounding country, and the hardy settlers seized their arms, and, with the cry of French and vengeance! hastened away to the scenes of action at Lexington, Ticonderoga, and Bunker Hill. We are aware that some historians have classed this affair among the difficulties and skirmishes growing out of what has usually been termed the New York controversy, while others have treated the subject in a manner which shows them to be doubtful in what light to place the transaction; and, for that reason apparently, they have slid over the matter in those gen- eral and ambiguous terms so often and reprehensibly indulged in by writers at a loss-about facts, to conceal their own ignorance, or to avoid the responsibility of deciding the point at issue. But a careful examination of the subject has led us to the conclusion, that the affair in question had little or no connection, in reality, with the New York controversy, but that it was wholly of a rev- olutionary character. No resistance to the authority of New York had ever been previously made in this section of the Grants; nor did the opposers of this court, in any of their remonstrances, or other proceedings, either before or after the massacre, assign any reason for their doings which can be fairly construed into an objection to the jurisdiction of that province, as such; or any otherwise than that it had, up to that time, refused to adopt the resolves and recommendations of the Continental Congress. On the contrary, all their arguments are based on their duty and 9   z108 T2E .TRAuNGERS, ,determination of joining their revolting brethren in the other colo- nies, and, consequently, of resisting the longer continuance of British authority among them. Such, indeed, is the ground taken by Dr. Jones, in his minute and authentic account of the occurrence, in which he was, as we have made him in our illus. trations, an actor. And even the inscription on the tombstone of the ill-fated French, written when the transaction, and all its attendant circumstances, were fresh in the minds of all, sufficiently proves, if further proof were necessary, that the version we have given of the affair is identical with the one generally understood and received at the time."     - It was this view of the occurrence which led us to occupy the space we have devoted in attempting to illustrate it; for it be- comes invested with a new interest and new importance, when it is considered, as we think it must be, that here was enacted the first scene of the great drama that followed; here was shed the first blood, and here fell the first martyr, of the American revolu- -tion, * The inscription here alluded to, which we insert as supporting our position rather than as affording any new antiquarian curiosity to many readers, is verbatim as follows: - "In memory of William French, son of Mr. Nathaniel French, Who was shot at Westminster March ye 13th 1775 by the hands of Cruel Ministerial tools of George ye 3d, in the Court House, at 11 o'clock at night, in the 22d year of his age. "Here William French his Body lies For murder his blood for vengeance cries King George the third, his tory crew Tha with a bawl his head shot threw For liberty and his country's good He lost his life and dearest blood."

Heart and mind Debased - dark passions rose, and with red eye, Rushed to their revel; until Freedom, blind And maniac, sought the rest the suicide would find." THE traveller of the present day, as he enters the town of !  .Guilford, on the southern confines of Vermont, will soon be struck with the peculiar appearance of many things around him. :  Few or no traces of a primitive forest are to be seen, while its place is supplied by a heavy second growth of woods, sixty or seventy years old, in the midst of which the remains of old en- closures and other indications of former habitations are not unfre- quently observable. On the cleared farms, also, may often be seen three or four different clumps of aged fruit-trees, scattered about in the nooks and corners of the lot, and sometimes extenid- ing into the woods, in such a manner as to preclude the idea that ;   -they could have been planted under any thing like the present arrangements of the farm and its buildings. Near these old rel- ics of former orchards ma-y likewise generally be perceived some levelled spot, remains of old chimneys, traces of cellars, or othper marks of dwellings long since removed, or fallen to decay. These, with many other peculiarities, give to'the whole town an aspect nowhere else to be seen in Vermont, nor even, perhaps, in any part of New England. And if the traveller be of a fanci- ful turn, he will associate the place with the idea of some deserted country, resettled by a new race of min ; and even if he be a mere matter-of-fact man, he cannot failto perceive that the town must have been originally tenanted under a division of lands and i  i an order of things quite different from those now existing. And Ian   either of these suppositions would be far better justified by the facts than most of the speculations of modern tourists made in their flying visits through the land, as will be seen by a recur- rence to the :early annals of this town, of which, for the purpose of insuring a full understanding of some scenes here about to:be described, we must be permitted to give a brief outline. The events connected with the first settlement of the tIown of Guilford, which ,afterwards became so noted as the strongh:.ld,f   AI. U]        TH;S tHRANGikERStK, toryism and adherence to the New York supremacy, form a curi- ous anomaly even in the anomalous history of Vermont. The territory comprising this township appears to have been granted, as early as 1754, to a company of about fifty persons, by a char- ter, which, unlike that of any other town, empowered the propri- etors, in express terms, to govern themselves and regulate the concerns of their little community, by such laws as the majority should be pleased to enact, without being made amenable to any power under heaven, save that which might be exercised by the British Parliament. Being thus constituted a band of freemen and legislators, at the outset, they soon took possession of their chartered piece of wilderness, organized by the election of the proper officers of state, and assumed the title of an independent republic, which their charter, in fact, created, any control of the Parliament of England being as little to be apprehended, in their secluded retreat among the wilds of the Green Mountains, as that of the Great Mogul of Tartary. And as novel as was the idea of a republic at that tarly period, when -" the divine right of kings " to govern all men was as little questioned as the divine right of Satan to afflict the pious Job of old, this enterprising little band of settlers, for many years, appear to have well sustained the character they had assumed, not only by carrying out, in all their public doings, that essential principle of a republic which makes the will of the majority supreme, but by the simplicity of their tastes and habits in private life, and their beautiful exempli- fication of the great law of love, that can only be fulfilled to- wards our neighbors by according to them equal rights and privileges with ourselves. At length, however, new doctrines began to prevail, and the independent character of our little re- public was soon, in a good degree, forfeited; and that, too, by the very means, it would seem, which had been taken to make it flourish and increase. It had been one of the conditions of the charter that every grantee should become lan actual settler, and, within five years, clear and cultivate five acres of land, for every fifty purchased. I And in accordance with this cunning policy for insuring the actual and rapid settlement of the place, the town- ship had been laid out in fifty and one hundred acre lots, except the governor's right of five hundred acres, which his excellency of New Hampshire, in granting Vermont lands, never forgot to reserve for his own use, in every township, but which the propri- etors generally contrived, as in this instance, to have set off on the highest mountain in town, considering it but respectful and fitting, as they used waggishy to observe, that so elevated a per-   OR TH, TORY'S D aUGHTER,     .10 sonage should be honored with the most elevated location. And' the effect of this policy, together with the low, prices at which the lands were put, and other inducements held out to draw in aet- tiers, soon became visible in the rapid. increase of the population, and consequent improvement of the town. So unexampled in these new settlements was its progress, indeed, in both the par, ticulars we have just named, that within twenty years from the   time when the sound of the axe was first heard in its woody lim- i its, the inhabitants were found to number nearly three thousand; ;i  while fields were every where opened in the wilderness, and buildings raised in such neighborly contiguity, that the whole town presented the appearance of a continuous village. It is not very surprising, therefore, that, through such an influx of settlers, coming from all parts of the country, and including many in. terested and active partisans of the York jurisdiction, a majority should soon be obtained, who were induced to depart from the views of the first settlers respecting the independence of their community, and adopt the more fashionable form of subordinate government, which prevailed in all the towns around them. And accordingly we find them, at their annual meeting in 1772, voting the district of Guilford, as they termed it, to belong to the county of Cumberl1nd and province of New York, and thereupon pro- ceeding to reorganize the town, agreeably to the laws of that  . province. This change, however, does not appear to have .been followed by any material alteration of their internal polity, or to have been productive of any great civil discord, till about the time of the opening of the American revolution; when .the  town became the prey of contending factions, of so fierce .and i! lawless a character as to convert this once Arcadian abode of k  virtue, simplicity, and rural happiness, into a theatre of violence !  arid social disorganization, which never, perhaps, found a parallel within the limits of order-loving New England. Sometimes the i  York party and tories,- for, in this town, it so happened that the 1   two were identical,- and sometimes the whigs and friends of the new state of Vermont, were in the ascendant; while scenes of Aid such disorder and outrage were constantly occurring between the belligerent parties, that his honor, Judge Lynch, for many years, appears to have beef not the least among the potentates of this notable republic. Nor was order restored to the ill-starred town till after the close of the war; when every refractory spirit, whether tory or Yorlker, was punished or awed into submission by the fiery energy of the iron-heeled Ethan Allen, who, then being relieved from the pursuit of more important game, came   106      .  THE RANGERS, thundering down upon the town with his hundred Green Mountain ]Boys, proclaiming to the disaffected, with demonstrations which theywell knew how to interpret, that the peaceable and instant submission of the place to the new authorities of the land should alone save it from being " made as desolate as the cities of Sod. om and Gomorrah." It was a dark and gloomy day in April, and the sleety storm was beating, in'fitful gusts, against the broken and creaking case- ments, and the disjointed, loosle, and leaky covering of an old, di- lapidated log-house, standing lay the road-side, in one of the thou- sand little dales, which, with mheir corresponding hills, so beauti. fully diversify the face of the town we have been describing. But as comfortless as this miserable hut was, and as poor and insuffi- cient a protection from the elements as it afforded, even for the healthy and robust, it was now the only shelter of a sick and des. titute woman, the widowed mother of Harry Woodburn. The hand of her son's persecutor, as it not unfrequently is seen to occur in the history of human oppression, was destined to fall even more heavily on her than on him for whom the blow was designed. The minion officer, selected by Peters for the purpose, had no sooner received his warrants, than, faithful to the cruel instructions of his employer, he had repaired post-haste to the residence of the absent Woodburn, of which he was authorized to take possession, and, with insults and abuse, rudely thrust the lone and unprotected occupant out of doors, in despite of all her entreaties for mercy, or delay till her son should return, or even for one day, to give her an opportunity to find some shelter for her now houseless head. He then, with the aid of the three or four ruffian assistants enlisted to accompany him, threw all the furni. i ture out of the windows or doors into the mud and snow beneath, where the whole, consisting of crockery and glasses, now half broken by the fall, and beds, linen, kettles, chairs, tables, and the like, soon lay piled promiscuously together. Having thus driven the terrified and distressed woman from the comfortable abode which had formerly cost her and her deceased husband so many years of toil to erect and furnish; and having, to add to the wrong, either injured or destroyed the greater part of h6r little stock of goods, by the wanton or careless manner in which they had been removed, this brutal officer next proceeded to thb barn, and by virtue of his capias for costs, seized the cow and oxen, the last remaining property of the wronged and ruinelt young man, which, after intrusting the present keeping and   OR THE TORYIS DAUGHTER.   I   107 defence of the premises to two, of his band, he drove away to another part of the town, to be sold at the post, as soon as: the forms of the law, respecting notice of the sale, could be complied with. The poor widow, half distracted at being thus suddenly bereft of house and home, spent the remainder of the day- in vainly endeavoring to procure some tenement into which she could remove with her furniture, or with so much of it as might yet be saved. On the next day, however, as a last resort, she obtained and accepted the present use of the deserted cabin-we have described, situated but a short distance from the house from which she had been ejected. And into this comfortless place, after several days of incessant toil and exposure, she succeeded in getting her damaged furniture, but not till her exertions, com- bined with her anxieties and grief, had given rise to a malady, which, though not at first very threatening, became, each subse- quent day, more and more alarmingly developed in her overtasked system. In this situation she was found by her son, who, being entirely ignorant that any judgment had passed against him, and, consequently, little dreaming what was taking place at home, had remained at Westminster. nearly a week after the massacre, attending the public meetings, which, as we have before inti- mated, followed that event; when he returned to Guilford, and, with feelings bordering on desperation, learned the extent of his 'misfortunes. But the bitterness of his feelings, as great as it was, at being stripped of all his property through such a series of wrongs, soon became wholly merged in anxiety and grief for his I  sick and sorrow-stricken parent, and in the exasperating thought that her sickness and suffering proceeded from the same source with his other injuries. And close and unremitting had been his attentions to her, until the day previous to the one on which we have introduced her to the reader; when he had been induced to leave for Brattleborough, or other more distant towns, to try to I  obtain money to redeem his stock, which was now about to be- sold, and which was worth more than double the amount, as he: had recently ascertained, of the execution on which it had been; Ig" seized. On the morning after his departure, she had become so much worse that she was compelled to take to her bed, and despatch her only attendant for a doctor. That attendant was Barty Burt, who had come down from Westminster with Wood-. burn, and had been engaged by the latter to remain with his mother during his absence. Having thus glanced over the events, which had occurred previously to the opening of this new scene of our story, we will now return to the point we left to make the. digression.   -e10f8       - THE RIANGERS Slowly, to the suffering invalid, rolled the sad hours away, as, with thick and labored breathing, she lay tossing upon her ride aco6ch, standing behind & blanket-screen; in one corner of her cheerless abode. -.Occasionally she would raise her fevered head from the pillow, and seem to listen to catch the sounds of expected footsteps, and her languid eye would turn anxiously towards the door, when, after thus exerting her senses in vain ,a few momeilts, slie would sink back upon her bed, with a long-drawn, sigh ng, groan, which told alike of disappointment and bodily anguish. At length, however, footsteps were heard approaching, the door opened, and Barty Burt stilly glided into the apartment, and approached the bedside of the sufferer. "'You have come at last, then," said she, lifting her diin eyes' to meet the face of the other. "It seemed as if you never wo ild arrive. But where is the doctor?" H"He will be on afore long, mistress; but I've had a time cn't in getting round, I tell ye!" replied Bart. a, I am very sorry, if you have had any unexpected trouble on my account," meekly observed the invalid; " but what has be- fallen you?" " O nothin," answered the former--" nothin, at least, tut what I was willing to bear for Harry's sake, who invited me hotne here till I got business, or for yours, who let me be. Though to be stopped and bothered, when one is going for the doctor, is worse than I ever thought of humans before. But it shows their character - dum 'em!" "' Did they really stop you, knowing your errand?" "4 Yes, that they did, mistress. As I was going by the tavern, arginle or two up the road yonder, three or four of them torifi'd yorkers came out, and told me I couldn't go for the doctor, nor nowhere else, without a pass from one of their committee. So I had to post back more than half way, to Squire Ashcrafts, and there had to be questioned a long while before he would give me any pass at all. And then again, when I got to the doct6r's, he said he wanted a pass, too; for he darsent go to see a whig woman without one, which I must go and get him from Squire Evans, another committee man. Well, finding there was ro other way to get him started, I went, feeling all the time just be- tween crying and fighting. And as soon as I got the bit of paper into the doctor's hands, I put for home, leaving him fixing to come horseback, which is the reason of my getting here first." "-1These are, indeed, dreadful times," sighed the Widow. "But thly can-not always remain; for, though God miay chastise us a   OR THEa TORY'S DAOUGTER. while for our sins, yet the rods of the oppressors will suretly be broken."            . "I'd rather see their necks broken," responded Iart, darly. "When we left Westminster, I thought, as much as could: i, the tories were all used up; but I find 'em down here thicker tha ever now, and as sarcy and spiteful as a nest of yellow Ackets:, that, like them, have been routed in one place and got fixed 't another. Blast their picturs, how I hate 'em!" "4 That is not right, Barty. You should love your enemies. Evil wishes, towards those who injure us, are both wicked and foolish." "I don't understand, mistress." ' -Why, Barty, to love is to be happy, as far as circumstances will permit; and to hate is but to feel disquieted and miserable. So when we keep the command to love our enemies, we obtain i reward which often outhalances the evil they inflict on us; or; at least, enables us the better to bear it; while, on the contrary, when we hate those who injure us, we receive a double evil- the wrong they inflict, and the unhappiness created by the ex- ercise of our- revengeful passions. Did' you ever think of that; Barty?" 4"No, mum; Harry talks kinder that way, sometimes; but I can't understand it, no how." 4' With your means of moral instruction, perhaps it is not sur- pricing that you should not; so I will drop the subject, and ask you if you heard any thing of Harry, while you were gone.'," r' No, mistress; didn't see nobody that knew he was gone.? "O, when will he return? He has now been gone two long, long days; but I must not repine." "Why, mistress, I kinder guess he'll be along to-night, iunless so be he's met with chnsiderable bother to get the money, o-W somethin. He must be here afore to-morrow afternoon, when', the sale is, you know."i ! Yes, I knew the sale was delayed till town meeting day, which is to-morrow, I relieve; though for what reason they put': it off I never heard. Harry felt so bitter about the affair, that. I thought I would not disturb his feelings by making any allusion/s to the subject. But there appeared to be something about it that I didn't- understand. Why didn't the sale take place last week, as first appointed?" "For as good a reason as ever a tory officer had for doing  any thing-or not doing any thing, may be, I should say-in the world," replied Bart, w'th a knowing look.  10   & IU         THE RANGERS, "tVhat was it?"                 j - "Why, when the day come, he couldn't find any cattle to sell." "What had become of them?" "Well, mistress, I don't know how much it is best to say about  that, considering. But I shouldn't be surprised," continued the speaker, while a sly, roguish expression stole over his usually grave, impenetrable countenance, " that, is, not much surprised, If it turned out that two or three of Harry's friends got the cattle out of the barn where they were keeping, one dark night, and driv 'em off into the woods, near the top of Governor's Mountain, and then backed up hay enough to keep 'em a spell; while the company took turns, for a few days, in going a hunting over the mountain, so as to come round, once in a while, to fodder and see to the creters, for which old Bug-Horn paid in milk, on the spot. Now, mind, I ha;en't said I knew this was so, but was only kinder guessing at it; for all that's really known about it- that is, out loud - is, that Fitch, and his men found the cattle up there; and the way they found them was by following up the trail made by the hay straws that' some one, after a while, grew careless enough to scatter from his back-load along the path." "Did my son have any hand in this affair?" asked the widow, anxiously. "No, mistress ; Harry is so kinder notional about some things, that we-thought - that is, I guess some thought - it wasn't best to say any thing to him about the plan till his cattle were fairly saved." "I am glad to hear it. I should rather see him deprived of his last penny than do a questionable act. We should never do wrong because others have done wrong to us." "There is a differ between your think and mine, I see, mis- tress. If they did wrong in getting away Harry's cattle so, as every body knows they did, then the tother of that- getting them back again - must be right. But you needn't tell any body what I've said, mistress; for they might, perhaps, have Bill Piper and me up, and try to make barglary out of it - or simony, I don't know but the law folks would call it-- the breaking into a log-barn. But hush! Somebody's coming. It is the doctor." Doctor Soper, who now entered, was a small, pug-nosed, chubby man, of ostentatious manners, and high pretensions to skill and knowledge in his profession; though, in fact, he was but a quack, and of that most dangerous class, too, who dip- into books rather to acquire learned terms than to study principles; and who, consequently, as often as otherwise, are found "doctor-   !

":Tenst - frequent - this pulse of yours, madam; showing great irrita- bility. Your tongue, now. Ay--rubric--dry and streaked, usual prognostics of neuralgy.

Why, don't know exactly, mistress," answered Bart, rousing himself from the dreamy abstraction in which he had been in- dulging, as he sat looking into the decaying fire - ." don't know, exactly; but it has got a considerable piece into the night. About nine o'clock, guess; may be more." "Nine o'clock at night, and Harry not yet returned! ^ sighed the invalid.- "Well, Well, I will complain no more." "Can I do any thing for you, mistress?" asked her untutored attendant, touched at the sad and despondent tone of the other. ' You may bring me in a pitcher of fresh, cold water, with some ice in it, if you will, Barty," replied the former. "It seems to me as :if this inward heat was consuming my vitals, since I took the doctor's medicines." The youth, with noiseless step, then disappeared with his pitcher, and, in a few moments, returned with it filled with water and several pieces of clear, pure ice, which were heard dashing against its sides. "How grateful!" said the sick woman, as she took from her lips :the wooden cup which had been filled and handed her by her attendant, and from which she had eagerly drained nearly a pint of the cooling beverage at a single draught. "There, now, set the pitcher on the table yonder, and raise the largest piece of ice Vp in sight, so, as I lie here, I can look at it. The mere sight of t seems to do me good."           j Another dreary hour rolled away in silence, which was broken ctly by thd restless motions and occasional suppressed groans of the invalid within, and the wailing of the winds and the pat. tering of the rain against the windows without, when a slow, heavy step was heard coming up to the house. "That is he-- that is his step!" faintly exclaimed the sick woman, partially raising herself in bed, and gazing eagerly towards the door; while her pain-contracted features were, for the moment, smoothed by the smile of affection and pleasure that now broke over them, like the faint electric illumining of a weep- ingi cloud., , The quick ears of the afflicted mother had not deceived her. The next instant Harry Woodburn entered the room, and, with a gloomy, abstracted air, proceeded to divest himself of his wet coat and muddy boots, without uttering a word, or bestowing any thing more than a casual glance towards the bed, to which he   OR THE TOBRYS DAUGHTER.       l supposed his mother had just retired, as was usual with her; abUt this hour, and not suspecting that she was more indisposed thaini when he left her. But as he now turned and approachedt eie4 fire, his eyes fell, for the first time, on her haggard afeatures, when, stopping short, with a look of surprise and lively concern, he exclaimed, - "Mother! are you worse, mother?" "r Yes, Harry, I am very, very sick; and O, how glad I amh that you are come."    I For several moments he sai nothing, but stood gazing at her with the distressed and stupefied air of one struggling to shut out painful apprehensions. At length, however, he aroused himself, and made a few hasty inquiries relative to her disorder, and what had been done for her; and, having been informed of all that had occurred in his absence, and now appearing fully to comprehend the danger of her situation, he sat down by her bedside, when his lip soon began to quiver, and his strong bosom heave with tumultuous emotions, while bitter tears flowed down his manly cheeks, as this crowning blow to his misfortunes was brought' home to his feelings. "Had they been content," he said, struggling hard, but vainly, to master his feelings - " had they but been content with robbing me of my property, I could have borne it; but to be the means, also, of murdering my only parent, is more than I can endure. God help me, or I shall go mad!" "Do not- do not be so distressed, my son," said the mother, deeply touched at this exhibition of feeling, accompanied as it was with such a proof of filial affection in her idolized son, and anxious to soothe and divert his mind. "I shall recover, if God wills it. Let us, then, bow in resignation to his dispensationS, and not disturb our feelings with unavailing regrets. Come, my dear son, cheer up, and tell me how you have succeeded in the object of your journey." "No success," he replied, gloomily. "No; I have been run- ning from town to town since yesterday morning, and have' niot been able to obtain a single dollar. So the cattle must go to satisfy the stolen judgment of that insatiable Peters." At this moment the conversation was arrested by a low rap at the door, when, after the customary walk in had been, pro-  nounced by Woodburn, the door was gently opened, and a tal, :robust young man, with a frank, open countenance, hesitatingly entered.

No, I won't lie, now; I lam not sorry, tarry ; and I will tell you why, hereafter. All I wanted to -know nlight was, whether you had got the wherewith to redeem the ttie, to-morrow being the last chance for doing. it, you know." ' Yes, I was aware of it, friend Piper; and many thanks for the interest you take in my misfortunes. But I cannot redeem I e stock. It must go: nothing more can be done to save it." ' Well, I don't quite know about that, Harry. I don't know about standing by, and seeing-a neighbor's property snatched away from him on such smuggled papers. But let that turn as it :ay, the subject brings to mind a certain circumstance, which I ,Ill name, after first asking a question; and that is, whether Peters has not been hung?"  "-Peters hung? Why, no; the prisoners are not to be tried till the new court we have been appointing at Westminster holds its first'session, some weeks hence. But why do you ask so strange a question?" u"Well, Harry, by way of arswer, I will tell you the circum- [tance I alluded to, which was this: Last night, as I was cross- Big about town drumming up friends to attend the meeting to- ' orrow, seetng we are expecting a hard tussle, I met a man that If uld have sworn was John Peters, if I had not known the fellow wqs close in Northampton jail; and as it was, I could swear it was his exact shape and appearance.  Well, knowing it could, pot be him bodily, it soon struck me that they had been hanging! off a parcel of them there, Peters among the rest, and that this was his ghost, kinder hovering; about here to see if his affairs were fixed up to his liking." "' Your notion of a ghost, Piper, if you are serious about it, is all nonsense," said Woodburn, who had listened with lively inter. fist to the singular story of the other. "Yes, that is nonsense; ut it has brought to mind a rumor which reached Brattleborough :e/trday, that all the prisoners at Northampton had been lib eated y ab'es corpus from  the chief justice of New York, a4nd wered nwow:at large.

"Yes, Tom Dunning came down with me, and he informed me that several others were on the way." "Good. Tom himself, in matter of managing, will be almost a match for Peters, whether ghost or no ghost.

"But you will be at town meeting to-morrow?" "Quite uncertain.

Statesman and whig moderator was dclared elected by a majority of the suffrages of the freemen. ' The next moment, the door was seen vomiting forth its throng of" excited victors, who, as they reached the open air, joined the crowd eagerly awaiting the result at the entrance, and, with them, renewed and reiterated the glad shout, till the distant hills respond- el in loud echoes to the roar of the stentorian voices of the tri, unphant party. After a fortnight's active exertions on the part of each of the -rt0 opposing parties, in mustering and drilling their respective forces, peparatory to the approaching contest, in which both were equally "nfident of victory, though too sensible of the danger of losing it to remit any effort, the voters had assembled at one o'clock in t e afternoon. After spending several hours in a disorderly and wrangling debate,in relation to the qualification of voters, which  a last resulted in rejecting the test required by the charter,--that o] being a freeholder, -and in permitting every resident to vote,the , b llots had been taken for moderator, or chairman of the meeting, 1   * hen, as much to the dismay of the tories as the joy of their op.  ppnents, it was found that victory, in a majority of three, had I   dbclared for the latter, who thereupon testified their exultation in te uproarious manner we have described.          i After a while, the noise and tumult within the house was sud- rnly hushed, and the clear, deliberate tones of some new speaker aldressing the assembly, became audible to those without the 'ilding; while the attent and eager looks of those who stood lias ning in the crowded pass-way, plainly evinced that some impor- nt and exciting subject had been introduced. At length thie a vce ceased, and a new eommmotion ensued within. /     ' "What new movement is that? what is going on in there now, *I                       v '  '    ^  .   'llE0      '   THE RANGERS, lPiper " asked one standing near the door, as the young "man came elbowing his way out of the house. ' Why, they are on Colonel Carpenter's resolution, Haven't Done of you here been in there to hear it?" said Piper, turning to the querist and other political associates, standing near by. 4' No; what is it about?" inquired several of the latter, with interest. "The York Rule," answered Piper, with an animated air. "';The colonel offered a resolve that we shake off the York govern. ment now, henceforth and forever. And this he backed with a speech- which would have done you good to hear. He went into them, I tell you, like a thousand of brick; and not a single tory tongue of 'em all dare wag in trying to answer it. They are now beginning to vote on the resolution, which, if carried, the colonel intends to follow up by another, cutting 6p all British authority, root and branch." At this moment, they were joined by Tom Dunning, who came hurrying out of the house, and, taking Piper aside, said, - "Do you ditter understand the plan of what's going on in there, Piper, and the importance to you here, in Guilford, of car- tying it?" "Not fully, perhaps," answered Piper. "I didn't have a chance to talk with Carpenter and the other committee before this move was made, and don't understand why they did not urge on the-election of the other town officers, as usual, after making a moderator, instead of getting up these resolutions." '*: cDer well, this is it; they are afraid to ditter try any of the tolwn officers on so slim a majority, lest the tory candidates should have got some of our voters under their thumbs, by way of debts or other obligations, which they will der make use of to get their-votes for them personally, but won't have 'emn pledged for this." ' "'That is well thought of," responded Piper. "They have in. deed got the screws on some I know of, and would so threaten 'em with prosecutions, that I'm fearful they would get 'em, sure enough. But what's the prospect about the resolutions?" '.Well, the colonel thinks, after what has ditter taken place at Westminster, that we can carry them; and if we can, it' Bill pretty effectually tie 'em up, even if they got their officerss But we der don't mean to let 'em.

Y u and Bart go in and vote; and I will beat about the bush, he re, for more help, before I go 'n ; for as they have just admitted s  ne to vote on a twenty hours' residence,-- as I can ditter s ear they did,-- I intend to yote myself, this time, and have;all th se from my way der do the same," said the hunter, bustling of to muster his forces.- Just as Dunning, who had collected a band of voters, without m icl regard to their qualifications, was pushing into the house at the head of his recruits, an o tcry was raised within; and, the. n Kt moment, Bart Burt was seen hastily emerging from the crpwd, followed by the kicks and cudgel-blows of the tories,- through whom he had been compelled, to save himself from. a rougher handling, to run the gauntlet to the door. ' What, in the name of der Tophet, is the meaning of that di ter treatment, ye shameless lubbers?" sternly demanded the hun ter, shaking his stout beech cane over the heads of the fore- m ost f his opponents. ' the deserves it! He is an Impostor!

' Then we will- der have you in, and vote too, if the ditter. di il stands at the door!" fierce y exclaimed the hunter..

Let 'em -live up to their owns rules [.: Sauce/f g)s. - .... 5::   10        THE BANGERS, goose is sauce for gander, the world over; they shall take him! they shall take him " i A hasty consultation was now held, and a plan of operations for eompelling the opposite party to admit Bart to the polls was soon digested. And, inl pursuance of this plan, Bart, who was short and light of weight, was mounted astride the brawny shoul- ders of Dunning, while piper, with his burly frame, was placed in fronts with a stiff cudgel in hand, to act as the battering-ram or entering wedge to the' crowd of tories, who had closed up the way with their bodies, Obviously to prevent Bart, or any other whig, indeed, from againi entering till the ballot-box was turned. Eight or ten stout, resolute young men were then selected and formed in column to bring up the rear, and give such an impetus to those before them as to force them forward in spite of all op- posing obstacles, till they reached the voters' stand in the house. "Ditter ready, boys?" now cried Dunning, firmly grasping Bart's legs, and glancing over his shoulders to his lusty little band of backers. "All ready there, behind, boys? - Then go ahead, as ,'if ditter Belzebub kicked ye an end! At the word, Piper, gathering himself up like a ram for a but- ting match, made a lunge head foremost into the recoiling ranks of the tories, and, borne irresistibly forward by the force of the rushing phalanx behind, overthrew, prostrated, and shoved aside, all before him, till the whole column gained the interior, and came to a halt before thelballot-box. "I protest against that fellow's voting!" exclaimed Peters, approaching the stand asl Bart, from his lofty seat on Dunning's shoulders, was about to put in his vote, which was a simple yea, written on a slip of paper, and handed up to him by some one stationed near the box to furnish the unsupplied. "I protest against such a glaring outrage! He is under age, and was very properly driven from the house."  "Prove it! prove it!" ishouted several of Bart's friends. You can't do it," cried another, " and if you could, two of your party, who are under age, have voted already ; 'tis a fact; deny it if you can!"   "In with it, Bart!" said Dunning, bending down to give the other a chance.    i "Yes; in with it; for he shall vote!" responded the rest. "He shall not vote!" vociferated Peters; " and if he at.  tempts to do it, I11 blow his brains out! f" he added, pulling out and levelling a pistol. Quick as thought, Bart- threw open his over-coatf and, drawing fromr beneath it the light, short gun there   OR THE TORY S DAUGHTER. con ma'ed, cocked, and brought it to his shoulder; while the threatening weapon of his foe was seen flying to a distant pdat- of t ie room, from a sudden blow of Piper's cudgel, and its dis. art dd and nonplused owner slinking away out of the. range of the us13icious-looking barrel still kept aimed at his head. midst the loud cries of order, and the heated vociferations of tI th parties, now raised to condemn or defend the transaction,: thrc gh the house, Bart, Dunning, and others of their company, who had not voted, now hastily deposited their votes, and retired unmolested.   { A though the portion of the revolutionary party, whose move- mer. s we have been more particularly describing, acting on the sup osed and probably actual frauds of their opponents, had thus secured Bart's vote, and the votes of two or three others, per ape equally illegal, yet the event soon showed that their policy n so doing was a mistaken one, and calculated to defeat the iery object they intended to promote; for, as will always be the esult where one party attempts to adopt the wrongful meas- ures of their opponents, the tories, now armed with the fact that- they had detected the i other party in a wrong more glaring, be- cause more public, than any they had perpetrated, made use of the advantage with such effect as to bring over several, intending to support the resolutions, to change their intention, and go against them. And, in addition to this, by way of retaliating, and , of making good at least all the ground lost by the questionable votes forced upon them, they brought forward every minor they could find approximating the size of a man, and boldly demanded their admittance to the polls. An opposition was, indeed, at- tempted to a measure so manifestly illegal, by the leaders of the other party; but they had become too much disarmed by the acts of their own partisans to produce any sensible effect; and their voices were soon drowned by the clamors of the tories, who- now admitted the boys by acclamation. This, as will be antici. pated, (decided the contest. On counting the votes, the resolu- tion was found to havej been rejected by more than a dozen ma- jority-a victory which the tories failed not to announce by shouts of exultation, w-iich out-thundered those of their opponents in their late short-livec triumph. The friends of freedom, being- thus caJght in their own trap, or, at least, worsted by the indis- cretion of their own friends, now pretty much yielded the contest; while the victorious Yorkers and tories had every thing in their own way, electing their town officers, passing denunciatory andf loyal resolutions, and continuing their discussions unopposed, till "!            -   122          THE RANGERS, it was nearly dark, when the meeting broke up in noisy .on- fusion.              l "Oyez! Oyez,! Oyez!" was now heard crying the well- known voice of Constable Fitch, as he mounted a stump in the yard ; while near by stood a gang of his confederates, hedgir g in Woodburn's cow and oxen, which the former lhad found the means to have on the spot, in readiness for the sale, the moment the assembly broke up. "Oyez! A cow and oxen, taken on execu- tion, now about to be sold to the highest bidder, gentlemen. We will take the oxen first; as fine a yoke as ever drew plough. Who will give us the first bid? Shan't dwell three minutes. Who bids, I say? One pound bid, gentlemen; one pound ten! one pound ten! and on Mr. Peters. Who bids higher?" But, as rapid as had been the constable's movements, he did not, as he intended, take the friendss f Woodburn by surprise. They had withdrawn from the meeting a short time before it dissolved, and met for consultation in the rear of the house, where, having arranged their plan of operations, they stood awaiting for the proper time to carry it into execution. "There!" exclaimed Dunning, as the constable began to cry the sale in the manner we have just described -" there, that is ditter Fitch; he is at it! All ready, boys? You, Piper and Bart, with your vials of oil of vitriol in your sleeves, ready to . uncork on to their ditter tails?" "Ay, ay!" "And your ditter snuff to throw into their eyes?" "Yes, that, too." "And your guns ditter cocked, and safe under your coats, you that are to fire?" "Ay, all right and ready - lead on I " "Der well, but remember we ditte- separate here, so as to come up on different sides of the crowd; land mind, don't let off your guns till the creatures begin to ditthr grow uneasy land der snort and blow." While Fitch was repeating the bids he had received forl the oxen, and was about to knock them off to the highest bidder, which still chanced to be Peters, he as suddenly told to hold on, by several persons who had just at that moment made their appearance in different parts of the c-owd. and who expressed their wish to bid, as soon as they cou d get up to examine the cattle. Owing to the duskiness, the faces of-the new comers did not seem to be recognized by the tories, who unsuspectingly opened and adrmitted them to the stand. Quickly availing tflem- o p n* a n  a d   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.      123 selves of the opportunity, the former, among the foremost, of. whom were, Piper and Bart, now crowded eagerly round -the cattle, and, after rapidly passing their hands over the cow and each of the- oxen a moment, and then stepping back, -began to banter and bid. Not much time, however, was allowed them to do either; for the cattle, all at once, became unaccountably restless, at first backing and wheeling about in their confined space, and then wildly tossing up their heads, snuffing, and assuming the, startled and furious appearance generalB.exhibited by this class bf animals when about to make a desperate effort to break away.! At this critical juncture, the fierce flashes and stunning rep ports of a half dozen muskets burst over the heads of the startled and astonished company from various points on the outer edge of the crowd; and the next instant the already maddened cattle, with loud snorts, leaping over or trampling down all in their way, broke thro igh the living hedge of tories around them, and bounded off, with their tails thrown aloft, and bellowing in wild affright, in different directions, towards the woods, leaving the amazed and broken crowd jostling and pitching about with exclamations of surprise, groans of pain, volleys of oaths, and shouts of laughter, all mingled in Babel-like confusion. "'Tis all the work of the cursed rebels!" exclaimed Petersm the first to rally ard comprehend the affair. "Fitch!" he added, pointing after the runaway cattle, "where the devil are your wits, that you don't order a pursuit?"     .  I "Yes, pursue and bring 'em back, instantly!" screamed the constable, awaking from the stupor and confusion of ideas into which he seemed tothave been thrown by the strange and. unex- . pected occurrence. "Yes, 'tis an unlawful rescue--it's a con-  spiracy! bring back the cattle! seize the offenders, every one of 'em! in the king's name I command ye." Obedient to the call, the obsequious tories instantly rallied for the pursuit, and, -breaking off into three distinct bands, eagerly set forward in the different directions taken by the fugitive cattle, then just disappearing over the distant swells, or in the borders of the woods. Dunning, Piper and Bart, who, in the mean while, had, unknown and unsuspected in the darkness and confusion, stood in the throng, keenly watching the result of their plan, no sooner heard the expected order of pursuit given, than, separating, like their opponents, and each joining a different I band of the pursuers, they sprang in before the rest, and, by their superior alacrity and speed, soon succeeded in taking the lead,   124          TH RAGERS,  and finally 'in completely distancing all others in the proniscuous chase. The lories, now soon wholly losing sight of their fleet, and, as they sti 1 supposed, trusty guides in the pursuit, became, in a short time, confused and at fault respecting the courses to be taken; and, after hallooing and running about the woods and pastures at random, nearly an hour, without discovering any traces either of the lost cattle or the missing pursuers, at length came straggling back to the Town House, arid, by way of saving their own credit, reported to Fitch, Peters, land the small party remaining there, that their swiftest runners jWere last seen nearly up with the cattle, and would soon be in with them, or that the creatures had been headed, and were on their way back, in another direction. On this, the company waited another hour; when, neither the cattle nor the- expected pursuers appearing, they began to suspect something amiss; and the inquiries and in- vestigations then put afoot soon resulted in the mortifying con. vietion, that the cattle had been overtaken and driven off by the same persons who previously had caused them to break away. Prompted by t;e enraged Peters, Fitch then offered a reward for the recovery of the cattle and the detectibn of those who had abducted them; when the company separated, to resume the search the next day. But although this was done, and the coun- try scoured in every direction for several cays, yet the search proved wholly fruitless. Not one of the ca-tle was to be found. Nor were the actors in the transaction, with Eny certainty, identi- fied, though the absence of Piper and Bart, for some days after the event, caused them to be suspected and marked for punish- ment, when they should again appear abroad.   OR THE TORBYS DAUGHTE1.        125 CHAPTER XI. '"Vital spark of heavenly flame! Quit, O quit this mortal frame! Trembling, hoping, lingering, flying, O the pain, the bliss of dying! Cease, fond nature! cease thy strife, And let me languish into life." PERHAPS the nearest and dearest, as well as the most interesting, tie of consanguity, is that existing between mother and son. Who has not witnessed the unfailing and unconquerable strength of a mother's love for the son of her heart and her vows, cleaving to its object through prosperity and through adversity, through honor and through shame, with a constancy which never wavers? And Wlhat son, especially after the thoughtlessness of youth has given place to the reflection of maturer years, and I - experience has taught him the insincerity and selfishness of the world- what son has not turned back and lingered, with the most grateful emotions, over the pleasing memories of a mother's care; pondered with the most heart-felt admiration over the deep, pure, and undying nature of a mother's love; realized f  more and more the priceless value of a sentiment so fraught with moral beauty, so exalted, so proof against -all those con-   siderations of self, those temptations of interest, before which all other ties are seen to give way, and, while thus realizing, found his yearning bosom oftener and oftener prompting him to exclaim with the poet,- "Where'er I roam, whatever realms I see, My heart, untravelled, fondly turns to thee." While the scenes of disorder and tumult we last described, and the similar ones that followed, were being enacted among the belligerent parties of this misgoverned town, the dutiful and sor- rowing Woodburn was continuing his attendance on his sick mother, from whose bedside no call of business or of pleasure was suffered for a single hour to lure him. And well might he have done so, aside even from the dictates of filial duty; for she was a woman not only of unaffected piety, but of education ",   AtIDs       THE RANGERS,  and intellect; and to her he had been mainly indebted for all that was good and elevated in his character, She had emigrated with her husband to this town, at an early period of its settlement, from the vicinity of Boston, where the latter had become so much straitened in his pecuniary circumstances, in consequence of being surety for an improvident and luckless brother, that he was induced, with the hope of bettering his fortunes, to gather up. the poor remnant of his property, and, with it, remove to the New Hampshire Grant's, at that time the Eldorado most in vogue among those seeking new countries. Here, having purchased one of the best tracts of land in the place, he commenced the slow and laborious process of clearing up a new farm. And this Herculean task, which may well be considered the work of a man's life, he had, after years of incessant toil and privation, nearly succeeded in accomplishing, and begun to catch glimpses of easier and brighter days; when he was taken away by disease, leaving his property to his wife and son, an only child, then drawing towards manhood. And nobly had that son discharged the double duty which now devolved upon him, - that of be- coming the stay and comforter of his widowed mother, and the sole manager of the farm, their only dependence. For, while discharging his filial duties in-such a manner as to gain him the reputation of being a pattern of a son, he not only kept good, but, by his industry and enterprise, even improved, the property to which he had thus succeeded. And he was fast surmounting the difficulties of his situation, and making hopeful advances towards a competence, when, in an evil hour, his flourishing little establishment attracted the coveting eye of the unconscion- able Peters, who, owning an adjoining farm, which would be rendered much more salable by being united with Woodburn's, undertook, at first, to wheedle the young man into a sale, or rather an exchange of his valuable farm for another, or wild lands, at false valuations and of doubtful titles. But, finding himself wholly mistaken in the character of the person whom he thus endeavored to overreach, and consequently failing in his attempt, he next began to think of the quibbles of the law, as the means of accomplishing his purpose. And having discovered some slight irregularity in Woodburn's deed, to begin upon, he then resorted to a trick quite fashionable among the corrupt specula. tows of those unsettled times-that of purchasing from some un- principled person, ready, for a small sum, to enter into the fraud, a deed of prior date to that of the one to be defeated, with descriptions of premises and references to suit the purchaser,   OR THE TORYS DAUGHTER.       ]'t the worthless assumed owner neither knowing nor earing what his deed might convey. Having secretly procured a prior deed of Woodburn's farm in this manner, Peters could see but one obstacle now in the way of his success, which was the town records, embracing that of Woodburn's deed. How was this to be disposed of? A bold measure, which could be executed by his minions under political pretences, occurred to him; and the   result was, that part of the town record soon disappeared. Peters then cornlmenced an action against Woodghurn, to eject him from his farm, the course and consequences of which are already known to the reader. Spring had now :come; but its bland and balmy breath brought no relief to the suffering widow. From the hour she had been I  compelled to take to her bed, her disease, though sometimes lulled, or raging less fiercely than at other times, had never for a moment loosened its tenacious grasp. And although her cheer- ful words, and meek, uncomplaining looks, had often misled her anxious son, or, at least, prevented him from despairing of her recovery, yet the Idry, parched, red tongue, the daily return of the: bright hectic spot, and the tense, hurrying and unvarying. beat of fthe strained pulses, might have told him how certainly and   rabidly the work of destruction was going on at the citadel of life, and better prepared him for the agonizing scene which was now to follow. It was a calm and pleasant evening towards the close of April, and the low-descending,sun was shedding the mellow light of his parting beams over xthe joyful face of reanimating nature. The invalid, during all the fore part of the day, had suffered greatly from pain-that general and undefinable distress which is so frequently found to be the precursor of approaching disso- lution.' To this had succeeded a sort of lethargic sleep, from which it was not easy to arouse her, so that she could be made to take any notice of what was passing around her. But now she awoke, clear and collected; and, glancing round the room, with a sort of pensive animation, met and answered the inquiring and solicitous look of her son with an affectionate smile. Presently, her wandering eye rested on some objects of the landscape, glimpses of which she had caught through one of the small, pat hed windows of the room, and she faintly observed,-- ' How pleasant it appears without! Harry," she continued, after a thoughtful pause, " could you take out that window before me? I feel a desire to look out once more on the green earth, and breathe the sweet air of spring."   128         THGE RNGERS, "Yes, mother," said thl other, approaching the bed, with a surprised and hesitating air; yes, I could 'easilydo it, I pre- sumne; but would it be qu'te safe for you to be exposed to the evening air "  "Yes, Harry; the time for the exercise of such cares is gone by. You need fear no more for me, now, my son," she replied, in accents of tender sadness. i The son then, with a d3ubtful and troubled look, proceeded in silence to comply with :he unexpected request; after which, he gently raised the head of the invalid, who, thereupon, gazed long and thoughtfully on -,he variegated landscape, which lay spread out in tranquil beauty beneath her dimly-kindling eye. "How beautiful!" she at length feebly exclaimed, in a tone of melancholy rapture--'beautiful of itself, but more beau- tiful as the type of man's destiny after his body has mingled with the dust. The scene we here behold, my son, exhibits the resurrection of nature. In summer the foliage and blossom ex. pands, in autumn the fruit is perfected, and in winter the visible part falls back to earth and perishes, leaving the hidden seed or germ to spring forth again into another life. So it has been, so it will be, with me. I have ad my brief summer of life, my still briefer autumn, and now my winter of death is at hand, from which I trust to dome forth into the more glorious spring of life eternal."         - "Do not talk tius, mother," responded the son, greatly moved -" do not talk thus: you distress me. I trust you may yet recover. You certainly look brighter this evening; andI hope another day will ind you still better." "No, Harry, not better, as you mean. If I appear brighter, it is but the brightn ss of the last flashing up of the expiring taper. I feel that my time is come; and thanks to Him who has prepared my heart to hail the event as a relief and a blessing." "O my mother, my mother, how can I part with you?" "4 My longer sojourn here, my son, would be of little benefit to others - even to you: my blessing is worth more than would be my further abiding: come ard receive it." The weeping son then krelt down at the bedside, and the mother, laying her hand on his head, pronounced her blessing and a brief prayer for his earthly prosperity and eternal happi- ness.         I  For several minutes, the ,on, overcome by is emotions, re- mained kneeling, with his head, on which still languidly rested the emaciated hand of the dying Inother, bowed upon the bedclothes, '     !   OR T4R TORBYS IDAUGHTEB.      429 rwhij the latter, s iuing back exhausted on her pillow', 1osed her eyes, and :eemed to be silently communing with herself She toon, however, aroused herself, and observed,-- ' My work is not yet quite done. I have a little more to say before the scene closes." "Say on, mother," said the other, making an effort to calm imself, as he now rose, and, taking a seat near, wistfully rivetted his gaze on her pallid face. "If you are, indeed, about to leave m  forever, withhold nothing you feel inclined to communicate; t for your dying counsels, my dear parent, will be received with pleasure and gratitude, and treasured up in heart and memory, as the last, best lesson of one to whom I am under such countless obligations." "You have ever acted the part of a dutiful son towards me, Harry; and that is always a mother's best reward for her care and affection for her offspring. And I know not that I have aught now to say to you, by way of counsel for your future guidance, being willing to leave you to practise upon the principles I have I : endeavored to inculcate, and be to others what you have been to 8 t me. But it was not of that I intended to speak. I was about i : to name some facts connected with our early reverses, which, it being always unpleasant to recur to those scenes of trial, I think I have never told you, but which, I thought, it might, perhaps, some day avail you something to know. You have heard us casually speak, I presume, of your uncle Charles Woodburn?  "I have, mother." I E   "( And you may also be aware that, through his misconduct, :H  we were suddenly reduced from the easy competence we once enjoyed to poverty and distress." I have so understood it, but never knew what kind of miscon- duct it was that led to our misfortunes." "It was imprudence in speculations, and profligacy in living, if  and not dishonesty, or any intentional wrong to us, as I ever be. lieved; though your father, in his desperation when the blow oi   came, would listen to no extenuation, but drove him from his presence with bitter reproaches and accusations. But your uncle, I:s before leaving the country, as he soon after did, sought an inter, AI.  view with me; and, after deploring the misfortunes he had: I  brought on my family as well as himself, solemnly pledged him- 1-2 .  self that he would, some day or other, more than compensate me or mine for all the losses he had occasioned us. And this is the circumstance I wished to tell you; for, though we never received any pertain information of him, yet something tells me   TlE HicANGERS, be still is alive, and has the means and disposition to fulfil his promise to you whenever you may find him, and he recognize ou as the representative of his brother's family, of whose location ere he probably was never apprised. I wou d suggest to you, herefore, the expediency of trying to trace hi-n out, and, if you succeed in doing so, make yourself and your situation known to - im; and, without preferring any claim, leave the result with rovidence." "Your sugge tiop, mother, shall not pass from me unheeded, i or shall I fail, in due time, to act upon it; but, at present; I know not if the last tie that binds me to this place should be sPvered--I know not but our down-trodden country may have the first claim on my services. Ever since the startling news of the massacre of Lexington reached us, a sense of the duty of devoting myself to her defence has pressed heavily and constantly on my mind.  And but for the stronger claim which nature and ney own feelings hiave given you, in your situation, to my pres- e  ce and attention, I might, before this, have been with my shouldered musket on my way to the scene of action. But even id the event of your death, I should hesitate to obey the call if I knew I must dlo it without your sanction." "I thank you, my son, for your affectionate deference; but you shall not go without my sanction. Having conjectured what m'ght be your fee ings at this dark hour of our country's peril, I was about to spea k to you on the subject. Yes, Harry, if you think duty calls you to the field, in defence of a cause so just and righteous as ours, go. You will be under the care of the same Providence there es elsewhere. Go, and with a dying mother's blessing, and a prayer of faith for your safety and success, do bat- tleI manfully for the Heaven-favored side, till the oppressor be cast down, and the oppressed go free." With a heart swelling with conflicting emotions, the young man locked up to reply, when his words were arrested on his lips, by the evident change that the countenance of the ot er had suddenly un ergone. The unnatural animation, which sh3 had exhibited duing the conversation, had faded away. She lay listless and ex austed, with her eyes nearly closed, and her libs slightly mov. ing in secret prayer. ' And now, Lord, what wait I for?" she at length audibly ut. tered. "But I  am not to wait," she continued, in a firmer tone, after a short pause. "The final moment is at hand! Farewell, earth! farewell, my son! May Heaven's blessings rest on you-- on all, and be the offences of all forgiven. Ah! -,he light of day   I           OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       131 is fading; but O, that brighter light which opens! those angel forms, with smiling faces, which beckon me away! Ready! I   come!--Icome!  :   And thus,-- blessing and blest, In death she went smiling away To the heavenly bosom of rest."  132         THE RANGERS, CHAPTER XII. "Whenever your case can be no worse, The desperate is the wiser e6urse." "ATE in the afternoon, several days subseq'uent to the melan- holy event described in the preceding chapter, a mingled compa- ny, of some dozens of persons, including several town officials, were seen assembling at the Tory Tavern, in Quilford; the object if which appearances seemed to indicate to be the holding of a magistrates' court, to try an offender who had -hat morning been arrested, and who now, in custody of Constable Fitch, was de- murely sitting on a rude bench under an open window of the room in which the trial was to be had, and in which the two jus- tices composing the court had already ;seated themselves 'at a table, in readiness, on their part, to commence proceedings. That offender was no other than our humble friend, Barty Burt, who had lucklessly fallen into onie of the snares which had been set for him and his suspected companions, round the country, in conse- quence of the part they had acted in spiriting awray, in so strange a manner, Woodburn's cattle, when about to be sold ontown meeting day. He and Piper, during the night following that affair, after meeting Dunning at an appointed place, and giving him charge of-the cattle, which had been successfully pursued and there collected, to be driven out of that part of the country by the hunter, left town in different directions, to avoid the arrest they anticipated, in case they remained; Piper going down the river in quest of some temporary employment till the storm blew over, and Bart setting off on a fishing excursion to Marlboro' Pond, situated in a then nearly unsettled section, about ten miles to the north. Htere Bart had pursued his sport unmolested, many days, occasionally going out to Brattleborough to sell his fish and buy pro- visions, and considering himself in this secluded situation perfectly safe from any search which might be made for him by the officers of Guilford. But the reward offered by the constable for the ap- prehension of the offenders, who had been soon pretty well iden. tified, had put all the tories in the town and vicinity on the watch; and the result was, that Bart had been seen, traced to his retreat, seized and brought back for trial. 5   OR THE, TORY'S; DAUGHTER.     13 Although Bart's general demeanor seemed to 'show a perfect indifference to the fate that now threatened him, yet the quick, keen glances with which, under that show of indifference, he noted every movement of those into whose power he had fallen, and the restlesness he exhibited when their eyes were not upon him, gave token of no little inward perturbation. And it was- ot without reason that his apprehensions were excited; he knew the: character and disposition of the two tory justices whom he saw. taking their seats to try him, and he rightly judged that he need' not expect either mercy or justice at their hands. He had: also: detected one of the constable's minions, who had been despatched: to the woods for the purpose, stealing slyly round into the horse- shed, on his return, with a half dozen formidable looking green- beech rods; and he was at no loss to decide for whose: back they were intended, or by whose ruthless hand they were: to, be ap- plied. "You can't go that, Bart," he mentally exclaimed. "You must get away; so now put your best contrivances in motion, for I tell you it won't do for you to think of standing that pickle." And as hopeless as, to all appearance, was any attempt to escape his captors, who stood round him with loaded pistols in their hands, Bart yet confidently counted on being able, in some way or other, to slip through their fingers, and avoid the fearful punishment which he knew was in store for him, if he remained: many hours longer in their hands. To effect this, he looked for E no aid from others; for experience had taught him the value- of self-reliance. The whole life of this singular being, indeed, had E been one which was peculiarly calculated to throw him on his own !  resources, sharpen his wits, and render him fertile in expedients. i  He had been a foundling, and knew no more of his parentage than a young ostrich, that springs from the deserted egg in the sand. He was left, when an -infant, at the door of a poor me- chanic, in Boston, by the name of Burt, and by him transferred to the almshouse, where he was called after the name of his finder; with the pet name of Barty, given him by his nurse. Hel;e he was kept till he was four. or five years old, when he was: given to the Shakers, from whom he ran away at ten-or twelve. From that time, the poor friendless boy became a wanderer. through the interior country, generally remaining but al few months in a place, being driven from each successive home by misusage, or for want of profitable work for him to do, or, what: was- still oftener the case, perhaps, for playing off some trick-to: avenge the fancied or real insults he had-received, till, after halvs 12   134         THE RANGERS, ing been kicked about the world like a foot-ball, cheated, abused, cowed in feeling, and become, nm consequence, abject, uncouth and singular in manner and appearance, he at length reached the situation in the family of the haughty loyalist where we found him. While Bart was thus uneasily revolving the matter of his pres- ent concern in his mind, and beginning to cast about him for some means of escape, the constable was called aside by those who had undertaken to manage the prosecution, for the purpose of holding with them a consultation, the purport of which, though carried on in a low tone, and at some distance, was soon gathered by the quick and practised ears of the prisoner. It appeared that -the trial was being delayed in consequence of the absence of Peters, who was an important witness, and who unaccountably failed to! make his appearance. And it being feared that he might have been waylaid, and detained on the road, by some band of the -other party, to prevent him from testifying, as all knew he was anxious to do, it was settled that Fitch should start immediately in search of him to the house which he usually mrnde his temporary quarters in another part of the town. According- ly the constable, after putting the prisoner in charge of two stout fellows who were in his interest, with orders to guard himr closely, and shoot him down the instant he should attempt to escape, set forth on his mission after Peters. Bart's countenance brightened when he saw the savage officer depart, for he believed the ab- sence of the latter would greatly increase his chances of escape; and in spite of all the threats he had received of being shot, he resolved to improve that absence in making the attempt, though the manner of doing so yet remained to be decided, by the cir- cumstances which might occur. In the mean time a trotting-match had been got up in the road in front of the tavern, by a small party who had been boasting of the speed and other qualities of their horses; and it being now understood that the trial was to be delayed till the constable's return, the whole company left the house, and went out to the road to witness the performance. :Bart's keepers not being able, where they stood, to see and hear what was going on very dis- tinctly, and being equally desirous with the rest-to get a favora- ble stand for that purpose, after renewing the threat of shooting him if he attempted to run away, took him along with them, and entered the line of spectators extended along the road. After a few trials among those who began the contest, several new competitors led on their horses and entered the lists. By this   OR THE TORY'S' DAUGHTER.       135 time most of the company began to take a lively interest in the Iti performance, taking sides, and betting on the success of the di ferent horses now put into the contest. The prisoner having, by this time, through dint of persevering in good hunmor and socia- bility, in return for the abusive epithets, by which all his attempts to converse were, for a while, received, succeeded, in a great I-11 measure, in disarming his keepers of the stern reserve and jealous I  distrust they at first exhibited towards him, he was soon permitted to talk freely, and offer, unrebuked, his opinions of the success of the various horses about- to make a trial, which his previous observation and acquaintance with many of them, made during his residence in town the preceding year, enabled him to do with considerable sagacity. And his predictions being luckily fulfilled i:  in several instances, and especially in one in which his most   rigid keeper had been saved from losing, in a bet, which would ,  have been made but for his timely cautions, Bart at length found himself on such a footing of confidence and - good will with those whom he wished to conciliate, that he thought it would now do to   commence operations for himself. "I don't think much of such trotting, myself," said Bart, i  carelessly, as one of the contests afoot 'had just: terminated; "but there is one animal I notice here th-day, I should like to tIi bet on."           - "What horse is that?" asked the keeper above designated.  "That dapple gray mare hitched over there in the corner of I  the cow-yard yonder," replied Bart, pointing to a small, long- tailed pony, whose shabby Icoat of shedding and neglected hair " greatly disguised the remarkable make of her limbs and other indications of strength and activity. "That creature!" exclaimed the other, contemptuously; " why, she aint bigger than a good-sized sheep. You may bet if you want to, and lose; for there's not a hoi se on the ground but would beat her." "Well, for all that, Mr. Sturges," respoLded Bart, banteringly, "I'll not take back what I've said about the nag. And to prove my earnest, I'll make you an offer; I'll bet my gun, which you saw me hand the landlord for safe keepirg when they brought me in - I'll bet my gun against your hat, I'll take that creature and out-trot you, with any hbss you may choose to bring on." 1' Done!" exclaimed Sturges; "but you are contriving this up for a chance to get away, you scamp." "What should I want to get away for?"I haint done nothin; and there's a witness here that will swear to a thing or two for   1B6         oTH RANGERS, me, when the trial comes on, -guess you'll :find ; besides, aint you going to ride by my side, with a loaded pistol in your hand?" ' Yes,-and that aint all; P'llput a bullet through you the instant you make the least move to be off." "I'm agreed to that." 4"Well, but will they let you take the colt for the match?" rc6 Guess so; I'll venture to take her. The boy that rode her here has cleared out down to the brook a fishing; but I know him., and think he wouldn't object." Who owns the colt?" Old Turner did, last- year, when I lived with him; and the boy is :from that way, and borrowed her, likely." "Then you have rode her, have you?" asked Sturges, doubt- fully. "Never rid her with any other hoss, but know she can trot faster than any thing you can find here; so you may as well back out at once," answered Bart, with apparent indifference. "Not by a jug-full, sir ; but I must look me up a horse, and fix matters a little first; and then, if it is thought safe-for'me to trust you o ride, I'll go it," returned the other, with some hesitation. Sturges then stepped aside with the other keeper, and, after consulting with him a few moments, went forward and announced to the company the bet offered by the prisoner, and his own intention of accepting it, and indulging the fellow in a trial, if they thought best, and would assist in measures to prevent the possibility of his escape. The proposal was received with shouts of laughter by the tories; and eager for the fun they expected to see in so queer a contest, they agreed to be answerable for the prisoner's safety, and urged on the performance. The two keepers, now calling in others to take charge of the prisoner,- while they made their preparations, proceeded to ar-. range the company on both sides of the road, placing men at short intervals along the whole line of the course, commencing back about two hundred yards south of the tavern, and extending tot:he sign-post, which, standing on the edge of the beaten path in front of the house, had been agreed on as the goal. And not satisfied with this precaution, they then procured four long,- heavy, spruce poles, and, extending them from fence to fence aceross the enclosed road leading from the tavern vard: northward, formed a barricade five or six feet high, which, with the strong, high fences on each side of the whole course, except at the starting-point, where no danger was apprehended, seemed to cut off the prisoner, even without being guarded, from all' possible chance to escape   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       137 on horseback, as it was most feared he would do, after being allowed control of the reins. ', There, Bixby!" exclaimed Sturges, exultingly turning to his fellow-keeper, as they completed the barricade across the road be- yond the goal -" there! I would defy the devil to jump over this barrier, or any of the fences on the way, as to that matter. So the little rebel will hardly escape us by running his horse from the ground, I fancy. But we must look out that he don't jump off at 'the end of the race, or before, and cut into the fields. You may therefore station yourself somewhere between this and the sign-post; and if he attempts to leap from his horse and run, as we'fetch up here, shoot him down as you would a dog, and charge the blame to me or Fitch; either of us will bear it." Having thus arranged every thing to his satisfaction, Sturges, ordering the pony we have described, and the horse he had se- lected for himself, to be brought on, then took charge of his prisoner and rival, and conducted him, with great show of mock dignity, and amidst a noisy and jeering troop of attendants, to the ground marked off -for the place of starting, and now. desig- nated by the close line of men that had been stationed across the road to guard against the! prisoner's escape in that direction. F?! Bart, in the mean time, seemed perfectly indifferent to all these precautions of the tories, as well as the gibes and laughter which constantly greeted h m on the way, and, on reaching the pre- scribed limit, quietly dropped down on the grass among the com- pany, and awaited tfe coming of the horses with the greatest unconcern. The latter soon made their appearance on the ground, and were immediately led up and presented to their re- spective riders. , Lightfoot!" exclaimed Bart, springing up to receive his chosen pony; " do you know me, Lightfoot?" The animal instantly pricked up her ears, and responded by a sort of low, chuckling whinny, by rubbing her nose against his arm, and by other demonstrations of recognition and pleasure, which plainly showed the two to have been old acquaintances and friends. Bart then, stripping off the saddle and handingit to a boy to be carried back to tie tavern, again went to the head of the pony, and, after patting her on her neck, repeated certain words in her ear, which seemed to produce the instant effect of arousing- her spirit, and making her restless and impatient for a start. After going through these and other ceremonies of-the kind, which see'med greatly to amuse the company, he mounted, reined tip, and announced himself ready for the signal. 12*   :138         .THE itANGERS, After another delay, to indulge the company in the renewed shouts of laughter which were called forth by the ludicrous con- trast now presented in the appearance of the oddly-matched com- petitors, as the diminutive and shabby-looking prisoner sat awk- wardly mounted on his no less diminutive and shabby pony, by the side of the portly Sturges and his large and finely-built horse, the signal was given, and the parties set forth amidst the en- couraging hurrahs of the crowd. Their progress, for a while, was nearly equal ; and the pony, though very unskilfully managed by her seemingly raw and timid rider, continued to maintain her place by the side of the horse so fully, as to render the result of the contest extremely doubtful. But as they drew near the end of the course, and the horse, by the renewed incentives of his rider began to gain on her, she suddenly flounced, broke into a gallop, shot by the horse, givIng him a staggering kick in the chops as she passed, and, in spite of the apparent efforts of her rider, to bring her up at the goa l, plunged on directly towards the fence that had been thrown across the road. "Whoa! whoa!" cried Bart, in tones of distress and affright, still appearing to strain every nerve to hold in the ungovernable animal--" whoa! whoa! help, or I shall be thrown!" "Help him there! stop her! seize -her by the bits!" shouted Sturges, now riding up to the goal to claim the bet. But the perverse pony, veering about among those approaching on either side to seize, or head her, with sundry monitory kicks thrown out sidewise towards them as she went, the next moment reached, and, with a tremendous leap, cleared the barricade, and landed safely with her rider in the open road on the otheri side. Here Bart hastily made another apparent attempt to rein her up ; but rearing and spinning round on her heels, she again made a plunge forward, and set out in a keen run, making the :ground smoke beneath her feet as she flew, with astonishing speed along the road; while her rider, grasping her mane with both hands, and swaying from side to side, as if hardly able to 'keep his seat at that, continued to bawl and screech, at every step, "Whoa! whoa! stop her! stop her!" with all his might. The tories were so completely taken by surprise by these manoeuvres, and the unexpected feat of leaping the barricade, ,that -Bart and his fleet pony were nearly a quarter of a mile off, xbefore they sufficiently rallied from their astonishment and con- :fusion ,to realize what had passed; and when they did, hearing his piteous criegs for help, and expecting every moment to se6 him hurled headlong from his horse, they stood doubtfully looking   OR THiE TOBRS DAJUGHTER.        e at him and each other, several seconds longer, before they thought of following him. Sturges, however, now took the alarm, and, ordering the barricade to be thrown down, started off, with those who, like himself, happened to be mounted, in pursuit. By this time, the fugitive had passed over an intervening swell, which hid him from the view of the pursuers; and though their progress was rapid, yet, when they gained the top of the swell, which commanded a view of the road till it entered the woods, almost a half mile beyond, he was nowhere to be seen. But believing he must have gained the woods, they pushed on, in the vain pursuit, about a mile farther; when, meeting some towns- men, they ascertained that he had not passed in that direction. They then retraced their steps, carefully examining every by- path and open spot by the road-side, where any ordinary horse could be made to go; but making no discoveries, they concluded to return to the tavern for consultation ; for they grew more and :more puzzled to know what to make of the prisoner, or how to - account for his mysterious escape, some affirming '"he must have been in league with the devil, as no horse, in a natural state, could have leaped that barricade, or have gone off so like ;  a streak of lightning after he was over it; and his strange doings with the pony, when he first met her, and the bluish appearance - that attended him along the road as he went off, with such unnat- tural swiftness," were cited in confirmation. But when they reached the tavern, the prisoner, and every thing attending his escape, were for the time forgotten in the excitement occasioned by the more startling tidings just received. The constable had just arrived in great haste, announcing that Peters had been way- laid, and found murdered in the road, and calling on all to turn out to arrest the unknown but suspected perpetrators of the horrid deed. -               ;&   - ,w 4. JJCHAPTER XII u CHAPTER XIII. --- " despair itself grew strong And vengeance fed its torch from wrong." ON the same day, and near the same hour, on which Bart so singularly and luckily effected his escape from his vindictive enemies, the bereft Woodburn left his lonely residence and walked to the graveyard, to shed another tear over the freshy- laid turf that covered the remains of his sainted mother. Here, as, standing over her grave, he reflected on the many excellences of her character, recalled the many acts of her kindness and love towards him, never before justly appreciated, and, at the same time, thought of the circumstances under which she had sickened and died, his tears flowed fast and bitterly. While he was still lingering near the sacred spot, immersed in these painful reflections, two ladies, from a neighboring cottage, came, unper- ceived by him, along the road leading by the graveyard; when the younger of the two, wholly unconscious that any one was within the enclosure, left the other to pass on to the next house, and entered the yard to amuse herself there till her companion returned. Now pausing to read an inscription, and now to pluck a wild violet, she slowly wandered towards that part of the yard where Woodburn, still screened from her view by a clump of intervening evergreens, was pensively reclining against a tomb- stone in the vicinity of his mother's grave. And here, taking a turn round the shrubbery, she came suddenly upon him; and, stopping short in her course, she stood mute and confused before him, while her cheeks were mantled with a deep blush at the awkwardness of the position in which she unexpectedly found herself. "Miss Haviland!" exclaimed Woodburn, looking up in equal surprise; "Excuse me if I am wrong, but; as little as I was expecting it, I think it is Miss Haviland whom I am address. ing? t"It is, sir," she replied, in a slightly tremulous voice; " but 1 trust you will not think this an intentional intrusion. " "No intrusion, fair lady. You do not rightly interpret my   I           OR THE TORY S DAUGHTER.       l41 expression, which was one of surprise at seeing you here, when I had supposed you to be in another part of the country. When I last saw you, I supposed you -on your return to Bennington." "I   was so at that time. But having recently come over with my father, who; was journeying to Connecticut, I am now tarrying with a sister in this neighborhood till he returns. Your allusion to our parting, however, cannot but- bring to mind the circum- stances connected with our meeting, nor fail to admonish me df my great obligations to you, sir, which I have never before found a suitable opportunity of personally acknowledging. But be assured, Mr. Woodburn, I shall never forget that fearful hour; yet sooner far jthe hour, than the hand that snatched me fromn my seemingly inevitable doom." "We both may have cause to remember the incidents attend- ai ant on that journey to Westminster, Miss Haviland; and I, though I did but a common duty in assisting you, shall remember them, on more accounts than one, ILfear but :too long." "If you allude to your difficulties on that journey, and subse- quently with one with whom we were in company, I can only say, sir, that I have heard of them, and all your consequent mis- fortunes, with the deepest regret, scarcely less on account of the author than the victim.'; "I could have submitted to my pecuniary losses with a good degree of resignation; but, when I think of the crowning act, and the consequences that followed it-when I look on that p  grave," continued the speaker, pointing to the fresh mound, with an effort to master his emotions, "it is hard to endure." "Such misfortunes," responded Miss Haviland, visibly touched at his distress; 4' such misfortunes, - injuries, perhaps, I should call them,--I am sensible, are not easily forgotten; and I have sometimes feared that it too often might be my fate to be asso- ciated with them in youlr mind." "O, no, lady, no," s id Woodburn, promptly; " though it were better for my happiness, perhaps, if I could," he added, more gloomily; " for who wi I care what may be the feelings of -one who is now an outcast, without property, family, or friends . " . "Think not thus of yourself, Mr. Woodburn," replied the other, X while a scarcely perceptible tinge appeared on her faiir cheek; " feel not thusF You do to yourself, and I doubt not' to many others, great injustice; certainly to one who can only think of you with the warmest gratitude." "O, if all were like you, Miss Haviland!" returned W rod; burn, with much feeling; ":so just, so generous, so pur, bso   beautiful! But I have already said too much," he continued, checking himself. "I intended not to have intimated aught of the thoughts and feelings which have obtruded themselves upon me, even before I heard these kind expressions. And though what I have said cannot be recalled, yet I have no thought of pressing any questions upon you under the accidental advantage which your gratitude--other things being the same--might give me. I ask for no corresponding impressions--I expect none. Being aware of your position, as well as my own, I shall not drive you to the unpleasant task of repulsing me. I will repulse my- self. I will conquer this new enemy, though planted in my own bosom, lest it prove more dangerous to my peace than the one with whom I have so vainly contended in another rivalry." She raised her eyes with a look full of maidenly embarrass- ment, indeed, but with an expression more resembling that of sorrow than resentment, as she gently replied,-- 1 I feel additionally grateful to you, Mr. Woodburn, for your delicate and generous course under the circumstances in which, as you seem to be aware, I am placed. But as I now perceive my companion approaching in the road, you will excuse my departs ure. "Certainly," said Woodburn; "and  you will forgive what has been said by one who is so truly the prey of conflicting emo. tions?" O, yes, sir," she answered, looking up with a witching smile, as she bowed her adieu; " that is, I will when you do any thing worthy of my forgiveness."  Woodburn stood' mutely gazing after his lovely visitor till' hersmall and graceful figure, floating on in its devious course through the diversified grounds in almost fairy lightness, receded from his enraptured sight; when he turned away with a sigh to commune with himself, try to analyze his feelings, weigh conse- quences, give Reason her rightful sway, and follow her dictates. After a long and deep struggle with his feelings, he appeared to come to some determination, and, resolutely bringing down a foot on the ground, lhe exclaimed,- "No, never! I  will not give way to feelings which can only end in disappointment and mortification. Begone, enticing vision, begone  I  will harbor you no longer.' And under the impulse of his freshy-formed resulution, he abruptly left the spot, and hastened through the enclosure to take his way homeward. As he was about to pass out into the road, his attention was attracted by the barking of a  small dog, that, having followed the ladies.   fOR THE TORY S DAUGHTER.      143 and tarried behihd on :heir return, seemed to be intent on drag- ging out something from under a broad, flat stone lying in one corner of the graveyard. Feeling some inclination to know what discoveries theI dog was making in a spot so unpromising of any game that would be likely to attract him, Woodburn walked to' the spot; when he perceived the animtal to be eagerly tugging away at some object, which presented the appearance of the cor- ners of some old, leather-bound book, buried beneath the stone. His curiosity being now excited, he stood by and patiently waited to see the result. {In a few minutes the dog succeeded in drag- ging out the object in question, which proved to be an old record- book, or rather the remains of one, for a part of it had been' converted by the mice Into a nest, and the rest was mutilated and falling to pieces. Leaving the dog to pursue his object, which was now sufficiently explained, Woodburn gathered iup the re- mains of the book! and stepped aside to examine them. On beating off the dirt land opening the: unmutilated parts, he soon, and to-his great surprise, discovered it to be a volume of the town records; the very volume, the loss of which, as he believed, had caused his defeat in hi lawsuit with Peters. And hurriedly run- ning over the leaveS, his eye, the next moment, fell on the record of his own deed, with the dates precisely as he had contended, and standing in a connection which would have proved the pri- ority of his title, furnished him a complete defence, and saved him from--ruin! The previous suspicions of Woodburn, respecting the dis- appearance of these records through the agency of Peters, were now confirmed in teb mind of the former, as certainly as if he had witnessed the act; and this aggravating discovery, coming as it . did too late to be of any benefit to him, and at a moment, too, when his feelings, Notwithstanding his recent declarations to Miss Haviland, and his subsequent resolves, were sore from the insid- ious workings of jealousy, and the revolting thought of the pre- tensions of his!hated foe to her hand-- this discovery, we say, wrought up his mind, already imbittered to the last degree of endurance, to a state little short of absolute frenzy. And clinch- ing the fragments of the book, which contained the proof of the black transaction, i one hand, and flourishing the heavy oak cane he had with him in the other, he rushed out of the enclosure, and, with a disturbed air and hurrying step, took his way towards his desolate home, resolved, that in case he found, as he feared, that all chance of legal redress had passed by, he would, at least, unsparingly make use of the means now in his power in trumpet- ing the villany Of Peters to the world. i:              In, this state of exasperation, after proceeding a short distance, he unexpectedly and unfortunately encountered the very object; of his pent indignation, the haughty and hated Peters, who, on  horseback, was coming up a cross-road on his way to- the Tory lavern, where, as the reader has been already apprised, his tools and partisans were anxiously awaiting his arrival. "Ha! here? Then he shall be the first to hear it," muttered Woodburn, as with a flashing eye he suddenly turned and sternly confronted the other in his path. "What now, sir?" said Peters, reigning up twith a look of sur. prise not unmingled with uneasiness. t' I will tell you what, now, sir," replied Woodburn, in a: voice quivering with suppressed passion; "your frauds are exposed! Here are the remains of those very records you or your tools purloined to enable you to accomplish your unhallowed triumph over me, and now just found buried in yonder graveyard!" "Away, sir!" exclaimed Peters, recovering his usual assurance. "I know nothing of your crazy jargon : stand aside and let me pass." "Not till you have looked at the proof of what I assert, or acknowledged its correctness," persisted the other, extending his cane before the horse with his right hand, and thrusting forward the open book with his left. "Here it is; here is the record of my deed -dates and all, as I and you, too, sir, well knew them to be.  Look at it, sir, and restore me my property, or confess yourself a villain!" At this juncture Peters, who had covertly reversed the loaded whip he carried in his hand that he might strike more effectually, suddenly rose in his stirrups, and aimed a furious blow at the head of his accuser. But as sudden and unexpected as was the das- tardly movement, Woodburn threw up his cane in time to arrest and parry the descending implement, when, quick as thought, he paid back the intended blow with a force, of which, in the madr ness of the moment, he was little conscious, full on the exposed head of his antagonist, who, curling like a struck bullock beneath, the fearful stroke, rolled heavily from his saddle to the ground, The exclamation of triumph that rose to the lips of the victor died in his. throat, as. he took -a second glance at the motionless form and corpse-like aspect of the victim ; and, recoiling a step, he stood aghast at the thought of what he had done. After stand- ing aminute with his eyes rivetted on the face of his prostrate foe, Wo0odburn, arousing himself, hurried forward, and, raising the: heand, chafed the temples and wrists a moment, and then felt for ,   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       145 the pulse, when, finding no signslof life, he suddenly relinquished his hold, and with a look of horror and unutterable distress, has, ( tily fled from the spot, muttering as he went, "A murderer!- to crown the host of misfortunes-- a murderer!" Soon striking off into a deep glade, diverging from the public way, he continued his course, with a rapid step and troubled brow, on through the woods and back pastures, till he gained, unobserved, the rear of his own cabin, when, entering, he threw himself into a chair, and, burying his face in his hands, sat many minutes mo- tionless and silent, apparently engaged in deep and anxious thought. At length, he arose with a more composed look, and proceeded to make up a pack of his wardrobe, with such valuables as could be conveniently carried, including his mother's Bible. He then fitted his pack to his shoulders, took down his gun and ammunition, and, throwing a sorrowful farewell glance round the lonely apartment, left the house, and bent his course for the woods, in a northerly direction. After travelling in the woods and unfrequented fields about two miles, he came in sight of the point of intersection between the road near which he had been holding his course, and a road- coming into it from the central parts of the town. Here, con, cluding to pause till the approaching darkness should more perfectly screen him, before going out into the main thorough- fare leading up the Connecticut, he sat down on a log within the border of the woods, and again gave way to the remorseful feel. ings and moody reflections that still painfully oppressed him. His meditations, however, were soon disturbed by the quick, heavy tread of some animnal, which seemed to be approaching in the woods, at no great distance behind him. Instantly peering out through the thicket in which he had ensconced himself, he soon, to his great surprise, descried a horseman descending a difficult ledge, leaping old windfalls, and making his way through all the opposing obstacles of the forest with wonderful facility, directly towards the spot where he stood concealed in the thicket. Knowing that whatever might be the object of the per- son approaching, it would be his wisest course to remain in his covert, from which he could not move unobserved, and his curios- ity being excited by the appearance of a horseman in a spot that would have scarcely been deemed passable for a wild deer, he kept his stand; and continued to regard the advancing figure with the most lively interest. But owing to the thickness of the now full-leaved undergrowth, and the duskiness that by this time, had gathered in the forest, he could only catch occasional 13   "6,         THE- RANGERS, glimpses of either horse or rider, which enabled him to ascer- tain nothing more than that they both were quite diminutive, and, as it struck- him, rather oddly accoutred. They continued to advance directly towards him till within fifty yards of his covert, when the horse, in emerging from a clump of bushes, which still enveloped the rider, stopped short, and, looking keenly into the thicket, gave a quick, significant snort. "What's in the wind now, Lightfoot?" said the rider to his horse, as, parting the obstructing foliage with his hands, he thrust out his head, and disclosed to the surprised and gratified Wood- burn the well-known visage of his trusty friend, Barty Burt. "This is, indeed, unexpected, Bart," said Woodburn, stepping out into plain view. "Harry!" exclaimed the other, agreeably surprised in turn; "but are you sure there are no more of you there in the bush?" he added, with a cautious glance at the thicket. "Yes, I am alone here," Answered the former. "Well, I vags now!" resumed Bart, drawing a long breath, and riding forward -"I vags, if I didn't begin to fed rather tick- lish when Lightfoot give me that hint to look out for snakes, just now. But the case aint quite what it might have been, consid- ering." "Considering what?" "I know." "Of course you do, as well as what brought you here with a horse, in so strange a place for a horseback excursion." "Just so, Harry; same as you know what brought you here with a pack on your back, in so queer a route for a journey, when a smooth road is so near yo ." Well knowing Bart's peculiarities, and that it would be useless to try to draw from him the secret of his appearance here until he chose to reveal it, Woodburn, while the other dismounted and told his pony to be cropping the bushes in the mean time, related all that had transpired between himself and the victim of his deeply regretted paroxysm of passion, adding, at the close of his gloomy and self-accusing recital, - "I first thought, after reac hing my house, that I would return and give myself up to the! authorities; but knowing, whether Peters should live or die, that I should be a doomed man in this part of the country, I at length brought myself, perhaps wrongly, to try to get out of it undiscovered. And I have now set My course for Boston, to join those there gathering for the approach- ing struggle for liberty. And Heaven knows with what pleasure I shall now sacrifice my life in her battles."   "Good! that's grand!" warmly responded Bart, who had listened to the other with many a whew! of surprise at his ac-. companying expressions of self-condemnation for killing an antag- onist who struck the firsti blow - -" that's grand! Here is what goes with you, Harry; for, between us here, I and Lightfoot are r  clipping it from a predicament, as well as you." H   tc "So I suspected. But what is it? Let us have your story now." "Well, larry, in the first place, do you know this critter I call Lightfoot?1  "No; a; least I don't now remember to have noticed the ani- :- mal before." "( Well, it is the colt old skin-flint Turner cheated me out of, i -  last year." "I think you told me something about it, but don't recollect i?: the particul ars; though I had then no doubt, I believe, but the old man wronged you, as I understood you worked very- hard for him 1, 1 through the ; season." ;-i2 "I did, I ke a niggar - cause he promised to give 'me this colt, XI  then a little snubby three-year-old, for my summer's work, if I ;:H} would stay and work well for him, which I did, as I said. Well, supposing :he colt was to be mine, without any mistake, I made a sight of her, named her Lightfoot, fed her, got her as tame as a    dog, then trained her to understand certain words and signs, 1!  which I at last got her to obey; and whether it was to trot, run, Xi  or jump fe ces, she would do it as no other critter could. But iH:: justl as I had got hir to mind!and love me, as I did her, my time H   was out; X nd I went to settle off matters with the old man,.and   tell him I w/as going to take her off with me, when - rot his pic- tur! -he pretended he had forgot all about his promise to let me !! have her, End forbid my touching her, saying he had paid me all ! i I earnt in the old clothes which he urged on to me, against my will, and ^hich whre not worth one week's work, as true as the book, Hany. Well, I couldn't help crying, to be cheated so, and, what was worse, to lose Lightfoot. But it did no good. I had to corne away without her, or any other pay; and, from that   time, I haven't seen her till to-day." A :  f "But ycu have' not now stole and run away with her, I trust, !  Bart?:" "No; she run away with me," replied Bart, rogaisly, as I can prove; for I hollered whoa all the time, as loud as I could yell." "But hcw came you mounted upon her at all?"   "8         ' tHHE HANGERS, ' Well, Harry, that- brings me to the worst and best part of my story, all in one; and here goes for it." Bart, in his own peculiar manner, then related, with great ac- curacy, the particulars of his arrest and escape from the tories, as  we have already described them in the preceding chapter, merely explaining, in addition, that Lightfoot well understood -the game, and knew she was to obey! c signs he secretly gave her with his feet and hands, however loud he, or others, might cry whoa, or any of the terms usually addressed to horses. He then pro- ceeded: - "Well, you see, as soon as I got over the hill, out of sight, I looked out for a hard, stony )]ace, where Lightfoot couldn't be tracked; and, soon finding o e, I leaped her over the fence, and made full speed for the wo ds, which I luckily reached jest in time to wheel round in safety, and see them thundering along by, in the road, after me. I then took it leisurely off in this direction, contriving to keep mostly in the woods, where I had learnt Lightfoot, in riding after the cows, last summer, to bee as much at home in as in the road." "And what do you propose to do with this horse now?" asked Woodburn. "Take her along with me, Io be sure, Harry." "And so make yourself, in law, a horse-thief, eh? Do you expect me to join company with such a character?" "Well, now, Harry, I didn't expect the like of thats from you, any how," observed Bart, evidently touched at the remark. "The creature is honestly mine ; ard I supposed I had a right to get; what was mine away, if I could, without going to law, which would help me about as much as it has you, I reckon., But sup- I posing that to be law which aint right and justice, and so make me out a thief, as you say, how' much boot could I aftfrd to give you, Harry, to swap predicaments with me? You have just  called yourself a murderer, which you aint, and me a horse-thief, which ./aint, any more than you the other. Now, how will you swap characters?"                    I "Bart, you have silenced me. Injustice and oppression have made us both outlaws, but not intentionally wrong-doers. Let us still abstain from all intentioral wrong, however trifling. ' And that leads me to observe, that whatever justification you may have for taking away the horse, you probably have none for car- rying off the bridle." "There you are out again, Harry. That bridle, which queerly  happened to be put on Lightfoot to-day, (as if it was kinder   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.        1 ordered I should get the beast,) it the very one I bought last fall to take her off'with; but being s worked up, when I left, I forgot to bring it away." "Upon my word, Bart, you are successful to-day in making defences." ; , Always mean to be able to co so, Harry. Nobody has any honest claims on me ire Guilford, now, nor I any on them. I leave 'em with every thing squared, according to my religion. t Except in the matter of your gun, which you leave- not exactly won by your opponent - behind you; do you not?" I "They are welcome to it; much good may i do em. It has ;I  gone pretty much where I calkerlated to get it oft-among those E who used me the worst; though I'd some rather it had gone to I Fitch, who hunts some, and wouli be sure to try it." t "That is queer reasoning, Bar.".' :?. i "' Well, there is a head and tai- to it, for all that, Harry." i' What are they?" I  I overloaded it, being for black ducks, and the charge raised a sem, in a flaw underside the barrel, which I could blow through. ,Atd the tail, or consequence, is, hat the next man who shoots it I  will wish he'd never seen it, I reckon." i' Ah, Bart, Bart, your religion,'as you term it, is a strange I on ! But let us now dismiss the past, and think of the future. If ou join me for the army, wha; do you propose to do with your ' hoe se -sell her?" ' Sell her?" why, I'd-as soon sell my daddy, if I had one. N(i, we'll keep her between us. You, and Tom Dunning, and Li htfoot are the only friends I have in the world, Harry; and I ant we should kinder stick together. So I've been thinking u the plan, that we ride and tie or keep along together and foot it y turns, to-night, till we get to Westminster, when we will beat ul Dunning, and leave Lightfoot with him, who can take her to so e of his sly places over the mountain, and have her kept for u s Thpn, if one of us gets killed, or any thing, so as never to - X  c me back, let the other take her; anrd if both fail to come, then le Tom have her for his own." !'  And Bart's plan being adopted, our two humble, friendless, and n arly penniless adventurers left the wood, and entering the n rthern road, set forth on their destination, Woodburn first unting the pony and keeping some hundred yards in advance, add Bart forming the rear guard, under the agreerent that the later, on hearing any sounds of. pursuit, should utter the cry of j           13* '   ;HOV         THE i RANGERS, *t racpoon, when both were to plunge into the woods, and remain fill the danger had passed by. After travelling in this manner, and at a rapid rate, about two I hours, without encountering any thing to excite their apprehensions or delay their progress, they entered a long reach of unbroken forest, which neither of them remembered ever to have passed through. But not being able to conceive where they could have turned off from the river road, which was their intended route, they continued to move doubtingly onwards some miles farther, till the increasing obstructions and narrowness of the path, together with ,the absence of the settlements which they knew they must have found before this time on the road up the Connecticut, fully con- vinced Woodburn they had lost their way. And he was on the point of proposing to retrace their steps, when, descrying a light some distance ahead, emanating, as he supposed, from the hut of a new settler, he at once concluded to push on towards it, for the purpose of making inquiries of the occupants to ascertain their situation. In making for the light, of which, for a while, only fee- ble and occasional glimmerings could be obtained through the dense foliage that overhung the devious path, they at length came to an apparently well-ciltivated opening, containing about a dozen acres, on one side of which stood a small, snug-looking stone house, built against or near' a boldly projecting ledge of rocks. As they approached the house, their attention was arrested by the loud and earnest voice of a man within, engaged, evidently, in prayer. Concluding that the man was at his family evening de- votions, which they had no thought of disturbing, they left the horse at a little distance from the house, and silently drawing near to the door, paused and reverently listened. A confused recol- lection of the supplicant's voice, together with his deep and fervid tones, his bold language, and especially the subject that seemed then mostly to engross his thoughts, at once awakened the interest and rivetted the attention of Woodburh. The great burden of his soul was, obviously, the political condition of his country. And, after vividly painting the many wrongs she had suffered from her haughty oppressors, and warmly setting forth her claims to divine assistance, he broke forth, in conclusion,- "My country! O my injured, oppressed, and down-trodden : country I shall the cry of thy wrongs go up in vain to Heaven? Will not the God of battles hear and help thee, in this the hour of thy peril and of thy need? O, wilt thou not, Lord, extend thy mighty arm in her defence? O, teach the proud Britons, pow -thronging our shores -teach them, scoffing Goliahs as they   OR THE TORY'S - DAUGHTER.      151 i are that therpe are young Davids in our land O, bring their cou nsels to nought! Scatter their fleets by thy tempests at sea, I  anCd destroy their armies on land! Sweep them off by bullet-and plague! and- and"-suddenly checking himself, he meekly adqed, "and save their souls; and this, Lord, is all that in con- sci(nece I can ask for them. Amen." ' oodburn now gently rapped at the door, which, after a slight   pause, was opened, and Herriot, the late prisoner of the royal co rt, stood before him. ' If this is Harry Woodburn," he said, after scrutinizing the oth r'6 features a moment, "he is very welcome to my hut. But yo ate not alone?" he added, glancing towards Bart, who stood se ral paces in the background.    (' No," replied Woodburn; "I have in company a young man X wh 3m you may, perhaps, recollect as the messenger that appeared se era times at the grate of our prison at Westminster, to bring   us news of the progress of the rising." 1:    Ah, yes, well do I recollect that goodly youth, and have ever since -.aken a peculiar interest ir him. Invite him in. All this is opportune, very-very," said Herriot, leading the way into the house. ifter the reclus6 had ushered his guests into the principal room of his very simply furnished house, of which he and a servant boiv, of perhaps fifteen, were the only inmlates, he turned to Wood- !  bu n, and said,- t ' As my retreat here in the woods, and the road that leads to I   it, are known to so few, I conclude that your young friend here,   MM. Woodburn, acted as your guide on the occasion." ' C, no," replied the other; " we had lost our way, having left the river road inadvertently, and were about to turn back, when, I   cac hing a glimpse of your light, we came on to make inquiries. W reither of us knew when we struck into the road leading hit er." ' Po you agree to that statement,without any qualification, m ster Bart?" asked the recluse! with a doubting and slightly\ pu szled air.        \ A A   ' Well, some of it, I reckon," answered Bart, with a look of ) dr1ll gravity. ,' hy you told me, sir," responded Woodburn, rather sharply, "tat yoU had never travelled this road before." ' o more I hadn't," replied Bart, composedly; " but I didn't sajr I didn't know where it turned off, for Tom Dunning told nme th ,"   152         ,THE -RANGERS, "Bart," said Woodburn, seriously, " though I am not sorry to have fallen in with father Herriot, yet, as between you and me, this needs explanation. It looks as if you purposely led me astray." "Well now, Harry, no offence, I hope. The thing was kinder agreed on, somehow, that you. should come this way, when you left Guilford, which was -understood would happen soon. If I hadn't fell in with you as I did, it was my notion to take Lightfoot here, or at Dunning's, and then go back and skulk there some- wheres till you was ready to come; but finding you and things all coming so handy like, when we got to where the road turned off, I thought I'd let you follow me into it, if you would, and say nothing till we got here."  "I am still perfectly at a loss how to understand all this, Bart; and I still wish you would more fully explain it." "I will take that task upon myself; for I suppose I am some- what in the secret respecting the little plot of your friends," said Herriot, going to a chest, and bringing forward a small bag of money. "This has bedn deposited with me for your use and ben- efit. It is the price of 'your cow and oxen, sold by Dunning to a drover from Rhode Island. The sum is, I believe, about fifty dol- lars, which I now deliver you, as your own unquestionable prop- erty." In the explanation that now ensued, it appeared that the cattle, which had been rescued by the friends of Woodburn, without his privity, lest the scruples it was feared he might entertain should lead him to interfere with the plan, were taken that night to the retreat of Herriot, who was made acquainted with the whole transaction; and that tie next day, while Dunning went up the river in search of a purchaser, the other, who was not without his scruples, also, about sanctioning the procedure, repaired to law- yer Knights for his opinion on the subject. And the latter,having been confidentially let into the secret, and given it as his decided opinion that the judgment, to satisfy which the cattle had been seized, was an illegal and void one, and that the cattle so seized might rightfully be taken for the owner, without legal process, if found out of the hands of the officer, the recluse returned and actively cooperated with the hunter; the result of which was, that a purchaser was soon found, who paid the money for the stock, and immediately drove it from the country. This, to Woodburn, was an unexpected development. And now, after hearing -the explanation of Herriot, being satisfied of the propriety of the course so generously taken by his friends in It   EI    -OR. THE TORitYS iDAGHTER.          153 his behalf, he gratefullyreceived the money; and, in turn, while I  Bart and the servant were out caring for the pony, he confideri-   tially disclosed to the recluse the painful occurrence of the after- noon wh'ch had led to his sudden flight from home, and his deter- i  mination of immediately joining the army, concluding by giving I  the particulars of Bart's arrest and singular escape from the   tories. 'You have acted wisely, Mr. Woodburn," observed Herriot, !  after listening with deep interest to the recital. "Peters may yet   recover; but should he not, I do not view the act in so criminal II a light as that in which lyou yourself have placed it.' And in the !  absence of all intentioni of killing the man, I feel very clear that i  it is not a deed meriting the punishment you would be likely to : receive, if you had put your fate into the hands of the corrupted witnesses who would probably have been brought against you. Yes, you have acted wisely in leaving that wicked Babel of tory- ism, and nobly in devoting yourself to the cause of your bleeding t  country. My blessing, and prayers will attend you and your young friend, to whom, I trust, you will act the friend and adviser X  he will doubtless need. But come, Harry," he added, taking up a I  light, and maki'ng a sign for the other to follow him, " some new :H'Xi: notions have come into my head since I became'acquainted with  A  you and your young f:iend, at Westminster, and knowing of no  two persons in whom I take greater interest, I have concluded to yH impart something to yo. in confidence." So saying;, h led the way into the ,cellar, the bottom of which- was flagged over with stoned of various shapes and sizes; when, ;  pointing to a broad, flat stone lying near the centre - of the room, he asked Woodburn to raise it. Wondering what could be the object of so unexpected a request, the latter, with considerable effort, succeeded in raising the stone to an upright position, and in so doing brought to view two small iron-bound casks, standing in a cavity beneath, anc labelled, in large inky letters," Printer's Type."    I "Printing, then, was formerly your trade?" said Woodburn, inquiringly, perceiving the other not inclined to be the first to speak. "Well, that is a respectable calling, is it not?" said the other, evasively.  J  "Certainly,' replied Woodburn;" but I had not looked for' - any immediate use for such implements in this new settlement." "The conterlts of those casks, nevertheless, are of more value than you may think them, Harry, and may soon be needed for i       f        "  '4   ,154         THE RANGERS, the public, in the times now at hand. But what I wish to say you is, in the first place, that you I are not to' divulge what ye have seen to any one but your young friend, and not to him u less you are satisfied he can be tr sted, or you are about to di And, in the second place, if you hear of my death, both of ye are to come here, take possession or these casks, and divide tl contents equally between you as your own. I have now ;no rel tive that will appear to claim them. You will also find, enclose in one of the casks, certain documents, which I have recenti deposited there, explaining my wishes, as well as somel secre of my life connected with discoveries lately made by me, the interest others besides myself. This you, or the survivor of ye two, if one should die, will do in case I am taken away,. Ar even if Ifcontinue to live, my designs will probably not be iltered and I shall wish to see you both again when you are permitted  return to four old homes.. And still further, I would say, thE should you be in want at any time. and will apply to me, I wi dispose of enough of this property to Supply your necessitie Now replace the stone, and let us return to the room above." Woodburn knew not what to make of all this mystery, or a fected mystery, as he believed it. But knowing the'singilaritie of the man, he forebore to ask any Questions, and they left th cellar in s:lence. Soon after they had returned, Bart and th servant came in; when a frugal meal was set before the trave lers. And while the latter were occupied in partaking the repast, the recluse procured his writing materials, and penning brief letter, presented it to Woodburn, saying, "There is t lette of introduction to a former friend of mine, who, I understand, appointed to an important command in the army now mdsterin at Cambridge. It may be of service to you. And now," 1b added, as his guests rose to depart-" now, my young frienc and' fellow- ufferers from oppression, go- deserve well of you country, an I desert her not till the British Dagons are all levelle to the dust, which may God speedily grant. Amen." In a few minutes more, ou/r adventurers were on their wa] And being now invigorated, both in body and mind, by wfat ha occurred during their call at the retreat of their mysterious friend they pressed on so rapidly, for the next tlree or four hours, the they arrived at Dunning's cabin, in Westminster, just as the firs faint flush of daylight appeared in the east.
