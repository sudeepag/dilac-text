We owe no allegiance, we bow to no throne; Our ruler is law, and the law is our own; Our leaders themselves are our own fellow-men, Who can handle the sword, the scythe, or the pen." VERMONT was ushered into political existence midst storm and' tempest. We speak both metaphorically and literally; for it is,. a curious historical fact, that her constitution, the result of the' first regular  movement ever made  by  her  people  towards/i(a ' -' independent civil ghvernment, was adopted during ihed dar'ket's ' period of the revolution, at an hour of commotion and alriaif -. when the tempest of war was actually bursting over her brdewr':  and threatening her entire subversion. And, as if to maket1  event the more remarkable, the adoption took --place amidst!a"l  memorable  thunder-storm, but for the  happening  of which, -at!--h:C-" t/-! particular juncture, as will soon  appear, that important pod'lea!: i measure must have been postponed to a future period,:and!  : period, too, when -'he measure, probably, would have beoet::   i feated, and the!blessings of an independent government. fd0ive.' lost,  owing  to  the  dissensions,  which,  as  soon  as  the: :e m dn o?/' -/)i ,^ danger was over, New York and New Hampshire com-nedi:n   :: Dined scatter among her people. The whole history of the settent    4  I        THE RANGERS,              7 and organization of the state, indeed, exhibits a striking anomaly, when viewed with that of any other state in the Union. She may emphatically be called the offspring of wgr and controversy. The long and fierce dispute for her territory between the colo- nies above named had sown her soil with dragon teeth, which at length sprang up in a crop of hardy, determined, and liberty- loving imen, who, instead of joining either of the contending par- ties, soon resolved to take a stand for themselves against both. And that stand, when taken, they maintained with a spirit and success, to which, considering the discouragements, difficulties, and dangers they were constantly compelled to encounter, history furnishes but few parallels. But although every step of her prog- ross, from the felling of the first tree in her dark wilderness to her final reception into the sisterhood of the states, was marked by the severest trials, yet the summer of 1777 - the period to which the remainder of our tale refers--was, for her, far the most gloomy and portentous. And still it was a period in which she filled the brightest page of her history, and, at the same time, did more than in any other year towards insuring her subsequent happy destiny. In the beginning of this eventful year, the people of Vermont, by their delegates in formal convention assembled, had declared themselves independent - "Independent of all save the mercies of God," as the poet, who has furnished us the heading of this chapter, and who has so strikingly embodied the feelings of those he describes, has significantly expressed it. And having taken measures for publishing their declaration to the world, the convention closed their proceedings by appointing a committee, selected as combin- ing the most happily an acquaintance with form and precedent with a knowledge of the ways -and wants of the people, to draft a constitution to be submitted to a new convention, which the- people were invited to call for that purpose. In response to that, call, a new convention assembled at Windsor, in the month of July following, and proceeded, with that diligence and scrupulous regard to the employment of their time for which the early pub- lic bodies of this state were so noted, to take into consideration the, important instrument now submitted to them as a proper- basis on which to erect the superstructure of a civil government, suited to the genius and necessities of an industrious and frugal: people -a people who, though keenly jealous of their individual rights, and exceedingly restive under all foreign authority, had   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.        5 yet declared their willingness, and even their wish, to receive- and obey a system of legal restraints, if it could be one of their own- imposing. For five days, from rising to setting sun, this conven- tion employed the best energies of their practical and enlightened minds in discussing and amending the document before them. But their labors for the present, if not forever, had well nigh been lost ; for, soon after they had assembled, on the sixth day of their session, and while they were intently listening to the reading of the instrument for the last time before taking a final vote on its adoption, their proceedings were suddenly brought to a stand by  the alarming news, loudly proclaimed by a herald, who appeared on his foam-covered horse before their open door, that Ticonde- roga, the supposed impregnable barrier of frontier defence, had fallen, and our scattered troops were flying in every direction before a formidable British army, that was sweeping, unopposed, along the western border of the state, flanked by a horde of mer- ciless savages, from whose fearful irruptions not a dwelling on that side of the mountains would probably be spared! This intelligence, so unexpected and so startling, too nearly concerned the members of the convention, not only as patriots, but as men, to -permit their entire exemption from the general consternation and dismay which were every where spreading around themr; and many a staid heart among them secretly trem- bled for the fate of the near and dear ones left at homes in which the red tomahawk might, even at that very moment, be busy at its work of death; while the bosoms of all were burning to be freed from their present duties, that they might seize the sword or mus- ket andt fly to the relief of; their endangered families, or mingle in the common defence against the haughty invaders of their- soil. Any further proceedings (wi:h the subject on hand, at such a mo- ment, were soon perceived to be utterly iinpossible; and a mal jority of the members began to press eagerly for an immediate adjournment. But while a -'ew of their number, sharing less than. the rest in the general agita;ion, or being nhore deeply impressed with the importance of accomplishing, at this time, an object now so nearly attained, were attempting to resist the current, and pre- vent any action on the motion to adjourn, till time was gained for reflection, an unwonted darkness, as if by the special interpo- sition of Providence, suddenly fell upon the earth. The light- nings began to gleam through the dark and threatening masses of cloud that had enveloped th6 sky, and the long, deep:roll of thun- der was heard in different quarters of the heavens, giving warn- ingpof the severe and protracted tempest which soon burst over 1    them with a fury that precluded all thought of venturing abroad. The prospect of being thus confined to the place for some hours, and perhaps the whole day, taking from those moving it all in. ducement for an immediate adjournment, they now began to take a cooler view of their situation; and soon, by common consent, the business on hand was resumed. The reading of the consti. tution was finished; and, while the storm was still howling  around, and the thunders breaking over them, that instrument was adopted, and became the supreme law of the land.* One thing more remained to be done; and that was, to consti. tute a provisional government to act till the one pointed out by the constitution just adopted could be established. This was now effected by the appointment of that small body of men since  known as the Old Council of Safety of Vermont, and noted alike i  for the remarkable powers with which they were clothed, and  the remarkable manner in which those powers were exercised; for, from the nature of the case, and the emergency in which these men were called to eact, they were almost necessarily in. vested with the extraordinary combination of legislative, judicial, and executive power. But this power, absolute and dictatorial as it was, they never abused or exercised but for the public good; and in this they were cheerfully sustained by the people, who felt that they were thus not only sustaining the cause of  freedom, but the laws which were of their own providing, and which they were anxious should be obeyed.-  To that unique assembly, of whose origin we have been speak. ing, we propose next to introduce the reader. In obedience to   an order of the convention, issued at the moment of its hasty L dissolution, near the close of the memorable day before described, the different members of this newly-appointed body, many of whom, it is believed, were also members of the one just dissolved, i had promptly convened at Arlington. But finding themselves were endangered by the near vicinity of the enemy, they had adjourned into the more interior town of Manchester, within whose barricade of mountains they could proceed with their de- liberations with little fear of interruption. And here, conscious that the eyes of all were turned anxiously upon them, in the ex. pectation that they would provide for the safety of the infant ' Through inadvertence arising out of the unsettled state of the times, r. design among the leaders who might have fears for the result, the con- stitution was never submitted to the people for their ratification or reeco on; but, no questions ever being raised on account of this informality,  was acquiesced in as valid and binding.   state, whose destinies had been committe to their hands, they commenced the worse than Egyptian task devolving upon them - that of making adequate provisions for the public defence, while the means were almost whclly wanting; for, with scarcely the visible means in the whole settlement, in its then exhausted and unsettled condition, of raising and supporting a single company of soldiers, they were expected to raise an army. Without the shadow of a public treasury, without any credit as a state, and without the power of taxing the people,--lwhich, by the consti- tution just adopted, could only be done by the legislature not yet called, - they were required to do that for which half a million of money might be needed. Such were the difficulties by rhich they were met at the outset .-difficulties which, to men of Vordi- nary stamina and mental resources, would have been insurmount- able. But these were not men of ordinary stamina, either moral or mental. They had been selected by t he representatives of the people for the qualities which would it them to guide the helm of state in this difficult and alarming crisis. And, unshrink- ingly proceeding to the discharge of their high responsibilities, they soon evinced, by their conduct, that the confidence reposed in them had not been misplcced; for the glorious results of the field of Bennington, and the incessant and harassing warfare on the flanks of the enemy which both preceded and followed that event, and which drew forth from its despairing leader his best apology for his defeat and surrender, were, far mlore than is gen- erally supposed, the fruits of the combined energy and talents of that unequalled little band of )atriots and statesmen.* But the par- ticular time we have'chosen f or lifting the curtain from their secret roceedings was at the dark st and most disheartening hour they rere doomed to experience, and before the united mind of their body had been brought to bear on any measure which afforded a reasonable promise of auspicious results. The army of Burgoyne was then hovering on their borders in its most menacing attitude. Marauding parties were daily penetrating the interior, and plun. dering and capturing the defenceless inhabitants, while each day brought the unwelcome news of the defection of individuals whod A finer tribute of praise to the Green Mountain Boys could scarcely have been given, than the one involved in Burgoyne's letter to Lord Gea- ain, written about the time of the battle of Bennington, in which he says, "The Hampshire Grants, a country unpeopled, and almost ;un- known, m the last war, now abounds in the most active and the 'most bellious race of men on the continent, and hangs like a gathering storm n my left."   8           THE RANGERS, had openly gone off to swell the ranks of the victorious enemy, to whose alarming progress scarcely a show of resistance had yet been interposed. Nor was this the end of the chapter of trials and discouragementsr that awaited the council. Another blow was to be added, more calculated thal, all to test their firmness and bring home to their bosoms a sense of the perils of the crisis, and the necessity of immediate action, unless they should con- clude to yield at once to the current of destiny which seemed to be setting so strongly against them. But let us present the mor- tifying and disgraceful event, to which we last alluded, in another form, in which the historic pen, that thus far in this chapter has only been employed, may be legitimately aided by the pencil of fancy, while we bring the leading individuals of this body to view, and sketch the details of a scene as truthful in outline as it was important in result. The long summer day was drawing to a close. It had been thus far spent by the council, as had been the several preceding days of their session, in discussing the subject of the ways and means of doing something to avert the doom that hung over their seemingly devoted state. But up to this hour their deliberations had been wholly fruitless. Project after project for the means of raising military forces had been brought forward and discussed; and each in turn had been thought to be impracticable, and- had been consequently abandoned, till, wearied with their unavailing labors, and discouraged at the dubious prospect before them, they now began to think of giving up business for the day, when the door-keeper, with unwonted haste and an agitated manner, entered the room, and announced to the astonished members of the coun- cil the alarming tidings that one of their own body, and, until that day, an active participator in their discussions, had proved. a Judas, and was now, with a band of his recreant neighbors, on his way to the British camp. The news fell like a thunder-clap on the council, producing, at first, a sensation not often witnessed in so grave an assemblage. But no formal comments were offered; and, after the commotion had subsided, all sunk into a thoughtful silence, which we will improve by our promised intro. duction to the reader of the leading members of the council. Separated from the rest by a sort of enclosure composed of tables strung across one end of the apartment, which was a large upper room of an inn, hastily fitted up for the occasion, conspicuously sat the president of the council, the venerable' Thomas Chittenden, the wise, the prudent, and the good, who was to Vermont what Washington was to the Union; and who, though   OR THE TORTIS DAUGHTER.        9 not possessing dazzling greatness, -had yet that rare combination- of moral and intellectual- qualities which was more fortunate for. him- good sense, great discretion, firmness, honesty of purpose, benevolence, and unvarying equanimity of temper, united with -a modest and pleasing address. And by the long and. continued exercise of this golden mean of qualities, he was destined to leave behind him an honest, enduring fame--a memorial of good deeds and useful every-day examples, to be remembered and quoted, both in the domestic circle and in the public assembly, when the far superior brilliancy of many a contemporary had passed away and been forgotten. He was now something over fifty; but so fine were his physical endowments, land so temper- ate and regular had been his habits, that time had'scarcely left a trace on his manly brow; and his fair and well-moulded features- had almost the freshness of youth. And notwithstanding the uni pretending simplicity of his deportment, and the extreme plain- ness of his dress, the large arm-chair, in-which he now re- clined, furnished probably by some considerate matron of the neighborhood for his special convenience, could not have found, in the broad land, an occupant who would have filled it with more, native dignity, or one better fitted to restrain by courteous firm- ness, and by tact guide into safe and appropriate fields of action, the less disciplined and more fiery spirits of the body over which he presided. Let us now take a glance at thei more prominent members of this notable little band of public conservators. Here, immersed in thought, sat, side by side, like brothers, as they were, the two- Fays, those intelligent, enterprising, and persevering friends of freedom and state independence. And there sat the two Robin- sons, alike patriotic, and active, or able, according to the different spheres of action in which they were about to be distinguished- one in the tented field, and the other on the bench and in the; national councils. In another place was seen' the short, thick-set form of the uncompromising Matthew Lyon, the Irish refugee, who was willing to be sold to pay his passage to America, for the sake of getting out of the despotic moral atmosphere of the old world, into one where his broad chest, as he was wont to say, could expand freely, and where his bold spirit could soar un- clogged by the trammels of legitimacy. In his eagle eye, in every lineament of his clear, ardent, and fearless countenance, indeed, might be read the promise of what he was to become the -stern democrat, and the well-known champion of the whole- right and the largest liberty. In contrast to him, near by, Was, I-    10          THE RANGERS, seen the tall, commanding form, and the- firm and thoughtful countenance, of Benjamin Carpenter, who had just arrived, with pack and cane, from Guilford, from which he had that day come on foot by a route designated by marked trees, through the moun- tain wilderness, nearly thirty miles in extent. Farther on, and seated before an open window, was Thomas Rowley, the first poet of the Green Mountains. He was here because he was a public favorite, a trusty patriot, and something of a statesman. But, like most other poets, he was not without his peculiarities of temperament, as might have been seen by his manner and movements even in this staid assembly; for, as if disgusted with a tedious and profitless debate, and determined also not long to be troubled by the disconcerting news just announced, he had now evidently cast these cares from his mind, to indulge in the more congenial employment of gazing out upon the landscape, over which his kindling eye might have been seen to wander, till it rested, in rapture, on the broad empurpled side and bright summit of the lofty Equinox Mountain, whose contrasted magnifi- cence was growing every moment more striking and beautiful in the beams of the low-descending sun. On the opposite side of the room stood the mild and gentlemanly Nathan Clark, the future speaker of the first legislature of Vermont; and by his side, the dark and rough-featured Gideon Olin, an embryo member of Con. gess, was leaning against the wall, with a: countenance of mingled sternness and gloom. By the side of one of the tables, in front of the president, might also have been seen the stout, burly frame, and the matter-of-fact and business-like countenance, of Paul Spooner, 'engaged in 1writing a despatch. And as the last, though not as the least, among the strongly-contrasted characters of this assem- bly of whom we propose to take note, let us turn to the youthful secretary of the council, Ira Allen. So much the junior of his colleagues was he, indeed, that a spectator might well have won. dered how he came to be selected as one of such a sage and elderly body of councillors. But those who procured his appoint- ment knew full well why they had done so; and his history thenceforward was destined to prove a continued justification of their high opinion of him. -He was of an active, mercurial turn, and, as might have been seen, was not inclined -to remain long in one place or posture. He had now thrown aside his rapid pen, and, with a quick, light step and deeply-cogitating air, was traversing back and forth the open space between his table, in front of the president, and the closed door of the apartment.   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       1i Both in form and feature, he was one of the. handsomest men of his day; while a mind at once versatile, clear, and penetrat- ing, with perceptions as quick as light, was stamped on his Gre- cian brow, or found a livelier expression in his lucid black eyes and other lineaments of his strikingly intellectual countenance. Such as he appeared for the first time on the stage of public action was the noted Ira Allen, whose true history, when written, will show him to have been, either secretly or openly; the origi- nator, or successful prosecutor, of more important political meas. ures, affecting the interests and independence of the state, and the issue of the war in the Northern Department, than any other individual in Vermont, making him, with the many peculiar traits of character he possessed, one of the most remarkable men of the times in which he so conspicuously figured. "I have finished, Mr. President," said Spooner, now breaking the gloomy silence which had, for an unusual internal, pervaded the assembly ---"I have finished the despatch, suggested by your honbr, requiring the attendance of the absent member from the east side of the mountain - General Bayley. And having put it into the form of a familiar letter, I have ventured to enlarge somewhat on our perplexing situation, especially in the matter of the miserable Squire Spencer, whose treasonable desertion I little dreamed, when I commenced writing, I should have the mortification of announcing." - ' That is well," responded the president; " and we must look up some suitable messenge to convey it to its destination. But I had hoped to forward, the same hand, the despatch request- ing the aid and cooperation of New Hampshire, which has been deferred till some definite action of our own should enable us to inform the council of that state what we of the Grants propose to do ourselves towards the object for which we invoke their assistance. This they will doubtless consider essential to be known, before listening to our call, as otherwise they will not know whether they will find among us more friends to assist than enemies to impede them. But what can we now tell them? I * The original letter from Paul Spooner to General Jacob Bayley, of Newhury, written in council, requiring the attendance of the latter, and informing him of Spencer's defection, and the gloomy situation of affairs, is still preserved, and affords, notwithstanding the disheartening newsf it communicates, a striking proof of the determination of that body to strug- gle on to the last against the mountain of difficulties, which, at this dark crisis, seemed to lie before them.   12          THE RANGERS, will submit to you, gentlemen of the council," he continued, in a kindly expostulating tone -"I will submit to your good sense and patriotism, whether it is not now time to adopt some decided course to be pursued. We must not be disheartened by a few untoward circumstances. Providence not unfrequently frowns on us for our own good. And who shall say, in the present instance, that, our deliberations have not been wisely and kindly rendered of no effect till after Spencer's desertion, since, had we adopted a plan of operations while he was here, the whole of it, by this time, had been in the possession of the British general? But be that as it may, the event of this man's apostasy, of itself, instead of making us timid and irresolute in action, should but render W more prompt and decided. The people, as we all feel painfully conscious, I presume, expect much from us. Shall we disappoint them in every thing? Because we cannot consistently do all that may be expected, shall we resolve to do nothing? I have listened to your objections to levying a general tax upon the peo- ple, as the means of raising a military force; and, with you, I consider them valid; for to infringe the constitution, just adopted, by an arbitrary taxation, would be setting a dangerous precedent, and one which would come with a bad grace from those of us here who helped to adopt it. No; we must resort to other means. We can, if we will, borrow, pledging ourselves as individuals, with such others as we may find willing to stand sponsors with us, that the state shall hereafter pay the debt; or we may resort to voluntary contributions. I am aware the people are unable to contribute much. I am aware that a great portion of the inhab- itants have been driven from their homes, and are now living on i the hospitality of the rest. But for all this, the people can and will cheerfully contribute something --more, I think, than we should be willing to require of them. ii have ten head of cattle, which can be spared for the emergency. But amn I more patriotic than you, and hundreds of-others in the settlement? My wife has a valuable gold necklace. Hint to her to-day'that it is needed for the public service, and, my word for it, to-morrow you will find it in the treasury of freedom. But is my wife any more public-spirited than yours and many others among us? Gentle- men, I await your propositions." During this moderate, but really well-timed and effective ap. peal of the president, drooping heads began to be raised, per- plexed and desponding countenances grew brighter, and by the time he had closed, several speakers were on their feet, eager to respond.   OR THE TORY'S DATUGHTER.       18 "Mr. Carpenter has the floor, I think, gentlemen," said the president. "I rose," said Carpenter, " but to give my hearty response to the sentiments of the chair. It is time, high time., for some definite and decided action. Less talking and more action shall henceforth be my motto.- I have not now, it is true, any digested proposition to present to the council; but I soon will have one, unless others are offered; for, in this emergency, it is little short of a crime to dally any longer." "Ay, action! action!" responded several voices. "Action let it be, then," said Rowley, the next rising to speak. "If it be true, as has been urged, Mr. President, that we cannot raise money by general assessment without exceeding our powers and disaffecting the people, and that we must depend on volun- tary contribution, which receivers, appointed for the purpose, may more appropriately gather in than ourselvesi why are we needed here? I will, therefore, make a proposition, which, while it will be obnoxious to none of the objections brought against other plans of defence, will give gentlemen as much action as they want. I propose, Mr. President, that each of us here, before any more of us run away to the enemy, seize a standard, repair singly to the different hamlets among our mountains, cause the summoning drum to beat for volunteers, and lead them, when obtained, to do battle in person with this Jupiter Olympus of a British general, who has so nearly annihilated the country by proclamation." "'Tom Rowley all over! but a galt a gallant push nevertheless," vivaciously exclaimed Samuel Robinson, in an under tone. "And yet, Mr. President," he continued, dropping the jocose, and now rising to speak in form-" and yet, if our colleague's spirited proposal could be'carried into effect, and men be found to volunteer under such military leaders as most of us would make, -or if the different towns, as has been suggested by others, would order out the militia on our requisition,-even then, it appears to me, we should raise a permanent and regularly enlisted force, to serve a rallying point or nucleus for the militia, or our patriotic friend s arrmy of volunteers. I therefore move, as I was about to do when others claimed the floor--I move the raising of a regular force,l however small our means may compel us to make it; and as fthe smallest to be thought of, I will name one' company of one hundred men, to be raised and supported by one of the methods suggested by the president." "And I," said Clark, promptly rising-" and I, believing we VOL. II.    2    "          THE RANGERS, may venture to go a little higher than that, I propose we vote to raise two companies of sixty men each." "No, no!" cried several voices; one company! Means can be found for no more than one." "Yes, yes! the larger number first, Mr. President! I go for two companies," cried others. "And I go for neither, Mr. President!" said Ira Allen, stopping short in his walk, and turning to the chair. "For I believe the council, on a little reflection, will conclude to do something more worthy of the character of the Green Mountain Boys, than the raising of the paltry force which even the best of these propositions involves. And I doubt not the means of so doing may-be soon and abundantly supplied, without infringing the constitution or distressing the people. And I therefore move, sir, that this council resolve to raise a full regiment of men, forthwith appoint their officers, and take such prompt and speedy measures for their enlistment, that, within one week, every glen in Vermont shall resound with the stir of military preparation." "Chimerical!" said one, who, in common with the rest of the council, seemed to hear, with much surprise, a proposition of this magnitude so confidently offered, when the doubt appeared to be whether even the comparatively trifling one of Clark would be adopted. "Impossible, utterly impossible to raise pay for half of them," responded several others. "Don't let us say that till we are compelled to d o so," said the patriotic Carpenter, in an encouraging tone. "This proposi- tion jumps so well with my wishtes, that I would not see it hastily abandoned. For, although I confess I do not pretend to see where the requisite means are to come from, yet some new light, in this respect, may break in upon us by another day. And could we but see our way clear to sustain this proposition, we should feel like men again." "Amen to all that," responded Clark. And as the hour for adjournment has now arrived, I move that our young colleague, who offered this proposition with so much confidence in the dis- covery of a way to carry it into execution, and who is said to be very fertile in expedients, be appointed a committee to devise the ways and means of paying the bounties and wages of the regiment he proposes to raise; and that he make his report to the council by sunrise to-morrow morning." "Second that motion, Mr. President," cried Lyon, in his usual -     \    OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.        S15 full, determined tone of voice and strong Irish accent. "I go. for the whole of Mr. Allen's proposition, means or no means. But the means can, must, and shall be found, sir!   We will put the gentlema-'s brains under the screws to-night," he con- tinued, jocosely turning to Allen ; ( and if he appears here in the morning empty-handed, he ought to be expelled from the coun- I    cil. Ay, and I'1. move it, too, by the two bulls that redeemed me!" { I accept the terms," replied Allen, bowing pleasantly to the former. "Give me a room by myself, pen, ink, paper,- and a :i   lamp, and I will abide the condition." :z   t"For your lamp, Mr. Allen, as your task is to discover money where there is ncne, I advise you to borrow the wonderful lamp of Aladin," gayly added Rowley, as the question was put, and carried; and the council; in a half-serious,/ ortive mood, broke up, and separated for the night.  At sunrise, the next morning, as had been proposed, the council punctual y assembled to receive the promised report of their committee. Most of them, from having I dged in the same house, were -aware that Allen had spent the whole of the inter- vening time on the business which had been committed to his charge; for, hour after hour, during that important night, they. had heard the sound of his footsteps, as he continued to walk his solitary chamber, intensely revolving in his teeming mind the vexed question, upon the decision of which he felt the last chance of making a successful stand against the invaders of the state would probably depend. And this and the expectation, which had somehow been generally raised, that he would present!s6me feasible plan for carrying out his proposals, the character of which no one could conjecture, caused his appearance to be awaited with no little curiosity and solicitude. They were not left long in suspense; for scarcely had the president called the council to order, before Allen came in, holding in his hand-an * Matthew Lyon, who very soon became much noted as a leading partisan in the legislature of Vermont, and subsequently more so as member of congress from Kentucky, having, as before intimated, been sold to pay his passage from Ireland to Connecticut, where he landed, was afterwards redeemed by tke payment of a pair of bulls to the pur- chaser, by a gentleman of that state, for whom he was permitted to labor, at liberal wages, till this novel kind of indebtedness was cancelled. And as this bold and singular man entered upon the scenes of life as a s:uccess- ful freeman, he was fond of boasting of the romantic manner in which he became one, while the expression, "By the two bulls that redeemed me," became his favorite oath on all occasions.   b16          THE RANGERS, open sheet of paper, to which, as the yet undried ink showed, he had just committed the result of his night's labor. "Is the committee, appointed at adjournment last evening, pre- pared to make his report?" asked the president. "Fully, your honor," promptly responded Allen, who accord- ingly then rose and said, - "My report, Mr. President consists of two parts. The first comprises the nomination of a list of officers, from colonel to subaltern, for a regiment, to be styled The Rangers. The second part involves the subject more particularly committed to me, and proposes the, means of raising and supporting them. As the first will be useless unless the second is adopted, I will submit it without present reading, and proceed at once with the second and more important proposition, which, after a long and patient consideration of every argument for and( against the measure, I have concluded to recommend to the council, -as the best and most effectual means of securing the desired end. And that proposition, for the sake of convenience, as regards the action of the council on the principle involved, I have thrown into the form of the following resolution: - "Resolved, That by specific decree of this council, and under regulations hereafter to be made, the estates, both real and per. sonal, of all those who have been, or hereafter may be, identified as tories, aiders and abettors of the enemy, within this state, be confiscated for the military-defence thereof; and that so much of said estates as may be needed for the payment of the bounties and wages of the regiment now proposed to be raised, be forth- with seized, and within ten days sold at the post, for that pur- pose, by the officers appointed by this council to execute its orders and decrees in that behalf." The speaker, without offering any fuither remark in explana- tion or defence of'the measure he had reported, resumed his seat, and calmly awaited the expression of the council. But they were taken by such complete surprise by a proposition at that time so entirely new in the colonies, so bold and so startling in its character, that, for many minutes, not a!word or whisper was heard through the hushed assembly, whose bowed heads and working countenances showed'bhow deeply their minds were engaged in trying to grapple with the momentous subject, upon which their action was thus unexpectedly required. At length, however, low murmurs of doubt or disapproval began to be heard; and soon the expressions, " unprecedented step!"-- "doubtful policy!" and " injury to the cause " became dis-   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.     - 17 tinguishable among the over-prudent in different parts of the room; when Matthew Lyon sprang to his feet, and, bringing his broad palms together with a loud slap, exultingly exclaimed,- ;"The child is born, Mr. President! My head has been in a continual fog every hour since we convened, till the present mo- ment ; and I ould see no way by which we could even begin to do all that the exigency required, without running against law, or distressing the people. But now, thank God, I can see my way out. I can now see, at a glance, how all can be speedily and righteously accomplished. I can already see a regiment of ouri brave mountaineers in arms before me, as the Certain fruits of this bold, bright thought of our sagacious and intrepid young colleague. Unprecedented step is it? It may be so with us timid republicans; but is it so with our enemies, who are this moment threatening to crush us, because we object to receive their law and precedent? How were they to obtain the lands of the half of Vermont, which, it is said, they recently offered the lion-hearted Ethan Allen, if he would join them, but by confiscating our estates? What has be- come of the estates of those in their own country, who, like our- selves, have rebelled against their government? From time immemorial they have been confiscated. Can they complain, then, at our following a precedent of their own setting? Can they complain because we adopt a measure, which, in case we are van- quished, they will not be slow to visit on our estates, to say nothing of our necks? Can these recreant rascals themselves, who have left their property among us, and gone off to help fasten this very government upon us, complain at our doing what they will be the' first to recommend to be done to us, if their side prevails? Where, thqn, is the doubtful policy of our anticipating them in this meas- ure, any more than in seizing one of their loaded guns in battle, and turning it against them? Injury to the cause, will it be? - Will it injure our cause here, where men are daily deserting to the British, in belief that we shall not dare touch their property, to strike a blow that will deter all the wavering, and most others of any property, from leaving us hereafter? Will it injure our cause here to have a regiment of regular troops, who will, per, haps, draw into the field four times their number, in volunteers:? If this be an injury, Mr. President, I only wish we may have a few more of them; for, with a half dozen such injuries, by the two bulls, we would rout Burgoyne's whole army in a fortnight. Yes,-Mr. President, this measure must go; for it promises every thing to cause, and threatens nothing that honest patriots need   18      ,    THiE ANGERS, fear; and had I a hundred tongues, they should all wag a good stiff ay for its adoption." i  ' A bold measure, bdldly advocated! i' next spoke Carpenter. "But as bold as it is, Mr. President, I rise not to condemn it, but rather to say, that I am determined to meet it fairly, and without fear; and if, when I get cool enough to trust myself to make a decision, the objections to it appear no more formidable than they now do, I will give it my hparty support." "If the public should call this a desperate remedy, they must recollect that it is almost I our ionly one," remarked Olin, in his cool, quiet manner. "Nothing venture, nothing have; --let us go for it who dare!"  "Let us oppose it who dare! X warmly responded Lyon. "The measure will be a popular one; and let it once be known among the people, as I promise gentlemen it shall be, that this proposi- tion was considerately recommended to us by a committee we ap- pointed for the purpose -let this be known, and who among us'has nerve enough to stem the storrm of popular indignation that will burst on his head, for the timic and cowardly policy which led him to go against it? ! 4 Vermont," added Rowley -"Vermont was the first to show her sister states the way to take a British fort; let her also be the first to teach them the secret of making tories bear their proportion of the burdens of the war. I km already prepared to give the measure my support, Mr. President." Almost every member, in turni now threw in a few observations. The doibts and fears of the more cautious and wavering gradually gave way; and it soon became evident that the measure had found too much favor with the council to be resisted. Lyon, with his rough and pithy eloquence, had broken the ice of timidity at the right moment; and he and the originator of the measure, at first the only unhesitating members of the assembly, perceiving the gathering current in its favor, now warmly followed up their advantage; and, within two hours from its introduction, the resolu- tion was adopted. This was imnmediately followed byvthe passage of the decree named in the resolution, specifying the names of 'those thus far fairly identified as openly espousing the British cause in Vermont, and declaring their estates forfeited to its use. Allen's proposal to raise a regiment of rangers was then, as a matter of course, unanimously carried, and the officers he had nominated were, with a few alterations, as unanimously appointed. All were now animated with a new spirit. Hope and confidende had taken the place of doubt and despondency in their bosoms,   OR THE TORY S DAUGHTER.       19 and the remainder of the day was spent in carrying out the detailS of their plan, which all agreed s]puld now be put in execution, with the greatest possible promptitude and secrecy. In this, as soon as the different appointments, made necessary for-the execu- tion of the decree, were .completed by the united action of the council, all the members, individually, took an active part. And for many hours, they might have been seen sitting round the ta- bles, silently and intently engaged with their pens; some in draft- ing despatches to be sent to New Hampshire and Massachusetts, some in writing confidential letters, unfolding their plan, and ask ing the cooperation of the leading men in the different parts of their own state, and some in making out commissions for the military officers, or the commissioners and other officers of con- fiscation; while others were out, scattering themselves about town, wari y and cautiously inquiring out prompt and trusty mes- sengers, to be despatched, as soon as it was dark, simultaneously and post-haste, to convey these important missives to their differ- ent destinations round the country. And all being accomplished, -the blow struck, and the machinery put in motion,--the council concluded to adjourn, to meet again in a few days at Benningtor, the interim to be spent by them in repairing to their respective spheres of influence among the people, and there taking an active part in defending and explaining their measures, and assisting to carry them into operation. Such was the origin of those temporary tribunals in Vermont, subsequently termed courts of confiscation, which formed a prom- inent feature in her early history, and which furnished, it is be- lieved, the first example of the exercise of this extraordinary power ever known in the United Colonies during the revolution- ary struggle. And whatever may have been the effects of this retributive policy in other states, its results here were salutary and important. It put an immediate stop to any further espousing of British interests, especially among men of property, while, within the astonishingly short space of fifteen days, it brought a regiment of men into the field, well armed and prepared for in- stant service,-- thus securing those advantages to the defenders of liberty, in the peculiar posture of their affairs in which it wasi introduced, and giving that impetus to their military operations, without which the brilliant' successes that marked the ensuing campaign in Vermont could never have been obtained. Of this there can scarcely be a doubt. And scarcely less doubt can there be, that the important measure in question would not have been brought forward and adopted at the crisis, in which alqne,   ' 20          THE RANGERS, the advantages it then secured could have been derived from it, -but for its sole projector, the sagacious, scheming, and fearless Ira Allen. Speculative writers have often amused themselves in tracing 'great events to small causes. And in this they have oftentimes so wonderfully succeeded, as to show, beyond the power of man to refute, some of the most trivial circumstances of life, considered by themselves, to have caused the revolutions of empires. Were we to make out an instance of [this character, to be added to the many other remarkable ones which have been noted by the curi- ous, it should be done by tracing the independence of America to the measure which Allen so boldly projected, as he walked his lonely chamber, on the eventfi-l night we have described. The independence of the colonies was, at that dark crisis, balancing, as on a pivot; and the success of Burgoyne must seemingly have turned the scale against us. The success of Burgoyne, at the same time, hung on a pivot also; and the victory of Benning- ton, with all its numberless direct and indirect consequences, as now seems generally conceded, turned the scale of his fortunes, when his success, otherwise, could scarcely have been doubtful. But the victory of Bennington would never have been achieved but for the decided and energetic movement of Vermont, which alone secured the cooperation of New Hampshire, or, at least, insured victory, when, otherwise, no battle would have been haz- arded. And that essential movement of Vermont would never have been made but for the bold and characteristic project of Ira Allen. All this, to be sure, is but supposition; but who can gainsay its truthfulness? i^-   j       OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       2 CHAPTER II. "Say what is woman'l heart? -a thing Where all the deepest feelings spring; And what its love?-a ceaseless stream, A changeless star-- Ln endless dream - A smiling flower, that will not die- A beauty and a lmyst ary!" HLE the scenes last described were occurring at Manchester, in t e Council of Safety, whose secret and unforeseen action was abo t to be felt in the remotest corners of the state, an athletic, wel-formed, though plainly-dressed young man, whose fortunes, in common with those of hundredst around him, were suddenly and une pectedly to be affected by the movements of that body, might have been seen, in the evening twilight, moving, with slow and apparently hesitating steps, across a new-mown field, towards a neal and commodious dwelling, si:uated on the main road lead- ing from the town just named, to the south, and near where it entered the then fast increasing little village of Bennington. Though he wore no regular military uniform, or arms that were visible, yet there was that in his gait, manner, and general ap- pearance, which indicated the recent occupation of a soldier; while the natural cast of his bold, manly features, and the clear, calm, and steady expression of his fine countenance, all combined to show him a man of coolness and courage; and that, conse- quently, the seeming timidity and indecision of his present move- men s were attributable to some passing doubts respecting the issue of the business on hand,'or other causes of a similar char- acter, rather than any general rant of firmness and resolution; After advancing within a stonres -hrow of the house, he turned into a clump of small trees, which, extending along the outer bord r of an unenclosed garden to the north of the establishment, had concealed his approach; and here taking a position that com anded a view of the front and rear entrances of the house, he s emed to await some expectec event, with manifestations of, considerable uneasiness and solicitude. In a few moments, a: sligh stir, as of company taking leave, was heard iA the front part of the house; and very soon a fashionably dressed personage,   ':yZf        THE RANGERS, of a somewhat swaggering deportment, accompanied with many of those supercilious airs with which the colonial loyalists of the times often thought to dignify their carriage among despised republicans, made his appearance in the yard, where, equipped for riding, stood a stout, well-conditioned horse, which he ap- proached and led out some distance into the road, preparatory to mounting. He then paused, and, with a hasty glance around him, covertly drew forth, from a concealed girdle apparently, a pair of good-sized pistols, and carefully examined their flints and priming; after which he replaced them, and, vaulting into his saddle, rode leisurely away along the road leading northward. In the mean time, the person first described retained his position within his leafy concealment, where, unseen himself, he had seen and watched from the first, with keen interest, all the movements of the other, whom, at length, he seemed to recognize, with recollections which caused him to recoil, and his whole counte. nance to contract and darken with angry and disquieting emo. tions. He was not allowed much time, however, for indulging his disturbed feelings; for scarcely had the object of his annoy- ance disappeared, before his attention was attracted by a slight rustling sound somewhere within the garden; when, turning his head, the frown that had gathered on his brow suddenly gave place to a look of joyful animation, as his eager eye caught a glimpse of the light, fluttering drapery of a female, who, with soft, rapid tread, was gliding along the outer edge of the screen. ing shrubbery towards him. The next instant he was at her side, ardently grasping her half-proffered hand, and tenderly gazing into her sweetly-confused countenance. "X How grateful," he began, after a broken salutation -" how grateful I should be for this obliging attention to the note I sent you, soliciting a meeting which --" "Which my gallanti preserver of old will be pretty sure to misconstrue, I fear me," interrupted the maiden, with a half- murmured, sportive laugh. "No, Miss Haviland," he replied, too intent on a serious demonstration of his feelings to respond in the same spirit-" no, I am not so presuming; nor do I wish to count on the former service, which you so magnify, and which has induced you, per- haps, to grant this interview." "In part, I confess,"' was the answer to this implied question. "I suspected-I feared so," he rejoined, despondingly. "Would to Heaven you could have acted entirely aside from that motive,i and then I might have found cause to hope. But now," hea   OR THE TORY S DAUGHTER.    , C : addpd, with suppressed emotion-" now--  But O, how ean:  har" or the chilling thought of being doomed to love without a rf. tu ! Say, fairest and best, must this indeed be so?" the downcast look and the quick-heaving bosom were the onl] reply ; and the impassioned lover, gathering courage even froia t lese uncertain indications, proceeded:- "Years, evpntful years, have passed away, my dear Miss Haviw lane, since your face, like some unexpected vision, first greeted my sight, and its image, at the same moment, as a thing not to be resisted, sunk deep into my heart. And there, from that hour to this, it has constantly remained-remained in spite of all any attempts to exclude it; for I struggled hard to banish it, as had so much reason to do. You were the daughter of wealth and prosperity-- I the son of poverty and misfortune ; and, what was more revolting to my pride, you were found with my polit, icai opponents - my oppressors- nay, in the closest connection, apprently, with my bitterest foe. But with all the aid which the e thoughts and associations were calculated to lend me,'I strifggled in vain. And when I was driven, poor, sorrowing, and. desperate, from my home, by the wrongs and insults of this same man of whose position towards you I was not left in doubt, I carried that image with me. It would not be eradicated; it would not even fade; but became more deeply impressed, and gre;} more and more vivid with time and change. In the stir- rin scenes of military life into which I then entered, --in the hour of battle, the exhausting march, the horrors of a prison- ship, the perilous escape, and the lone wanderings through the wilderness, till I again reached the soil of freedom, - in all these, the impress remained unweakened, constantly presenting itself to my thoughts by day, and shaping my dreams by night. And it was this, when, on my return, I came into this quarter, where I had learned our scattered troops ere rallying, and vhere I found- myS elf near you - it was this that brought me to your father's/: dwelli g--it was this, which, in spite of the coldness of my rec ptimn by all but yourself, urged me to the repeated visit, in whi;h I was driven with insults from your house." "Not by me, Mr. Woodburn," interposed the fair listener, in kindly and earnest tones -" not by me, nor by my consent or sanctioning. And it was mainly to show you this that I was induced to grant your request for this, on my part, I fear, imp prude; meeting. No! O, no, sir, I have never forgotten- I can  never forget-- to whom I am indebted for my life; and graitude, as welk as respect for his general character, will ever forbid   M4          TIPE RANGERS, mught but kind and courteous treatment at my hands. And I hope you will make some allowance for my father, who feels so strongly that the people, Iwhose cause you espouse, are criminally wong."  ,  "I do make an allowance," responded Woodburn--- great allowance for his imbitt red state of mind towards the defenders of the American cause; but does that fully account for the course he pursues towards me?" "To be frank with you, sir, it does not," she replied, after some hesitation. 'There are those often with my father, who are not backward in fanning his prejudices, and perhaps in insti- gating the undeserved treatment you have received, I may be unwise in saying this ; but justice to all, it appears to me, requires that you should be apprised of it. You will not surely make use. of this to embroil us?" "Certainly not; but what you communicate is hardly news to me. I well understand that the principal one of those to whom you allude is no other than the person who just rode away from your house."  "You saw him, then? I amn thankful you did not come in collision with him; for he is a man you must avoid. Yes, that was indeed Colonel Peters." Colonel Peters! Colonel, did you call him? Has he, then, actually joined the British forces, and received a commission for such a post in their army?" "Yes; but I had supposed this was known, else I might have hesitated to disclose it, lest his frequent visits here might implicate my father, who, I hope, may be induced to remain neutral in this 'unhappy contest." "Fear not, fair friend. No advantage shall be taken of this,. through my means, to the injury of your father. But, tell me, does that officious adviser of your father still urge a suit, and. plead an engagement, of which, I have inferred, you would not be sorry to be relieved?" "He does," answered the maiden, sadly-"he does urge a suit, and insist on an engagement, of which he knows I wish to be relieved.  "Why should he do this?"    ] "' Perhaps he counts on the effect of events to reconcile me - events which he seems to expect will shortly happen - the com- plete triumph of his cause, the disgrace, banishment, or death of its opposers, and his own elevation thereby to stations which, he thinks, no woman will refuse to share with him.

"I see my error, Mr. Woodburn," she replied, with an air of self-reproach and of slightly-offended pride, which, however; gave way to kindly tones, as she proceeded ; "I have unintentionally helped you -to an argument, while I am constrained to decide that no argument, so long as I stand in my present position, must pre- vail with me. Do not, then, O, do not press me with questions like these. You know not the extent of my perplexities, and I may not explain. Besides, are these the times to engage in such affairs, when the next hour may lead to an eternal separation, or place our respective destines as wide as theb poles asunder?  "But will you not allow me even to hope for the future?" still persisted the lover. "Why should I bid you tantalize yourself with hopes so likely to prove futile, when nobler thoughts should engross you?!Look, Mr. Woodburn," she said, pointing, with charming enthusiasm, towards the distant summits of Manchester, then beginning to be dimly visible in the rays of the rising moon, "cast your: eyes northward!

"If it must be so, my precious, my beautiful one, farewell to you, also."           . [Lips uttered no more, but the 'mute pause that -followed, while eye met eye, and hand lingered in hand, was not meaningless. The fond lover was not permitted, however, to prolong the entran- cing moment, which, as the slightly-returned pressure of the small white hand, closely imprisoned in his own, told him, had not beeni reluctantly vouchsafed him; for, quickly arousing herself, the maiden broke from his clinging grasp, and tripped silently away, leaving him gazing after her retreating form, and listening to the softipnd decreasing sounds of her light footsteps upon the grass, till the jar of the closing door, to which she had directed her devious course, made him feel that he was alone, and that the charm of the place was gone. With a sigh, he turned from the spot, and soon gained the highway; when, taking the direction in which his rival and foe had departed, he walked musingly onward, heedless alike of the cool and balmly air of the evening, or the quietly reposing beau- ties which the light of a full moon, now beginning to peer over the eastern hills, was gradually unfolding around him, and intent only on the dreamy images with which love and his new-fledged hope seemed conspiring for a while to amuse his willing. mind. At length, however, a quickened pace, a firmer tread, and a prouder bearing, showed that a different and less peaceful train of thought was springing up within. "So this evil genius of mine, it seems," he muttered, who forever appears in my path to snatch from me every prize I set my heart on, is secretly an officer in the British service, com- missioned, probably, to head a regiment of tories, whom he is now, by his false statements and delusive promises, attempting to gather from the weak and wavering of our overawed people. This must be instantly made known. Heavens! what effrontery!:- to be playing the spy under the garb of pretended neutrality, and seducing away the deluded men under our very noses, to lead them back to fall with fire and sword on their kindred and neigh- bors! And I am to be the particular object of his vengeance, I pre- sume, from the significant hint she gave me to avoid him. Avo6id him! He shall be spared much trouble to find me if that is what he wants. He is now the country's foe, and lawful game with me. I would that I could meet him to-night-yes, this night; and if I thought I could overtake him -stay, why can't this be done? -   X8          THE RAN GERS, 'filk Wtiee ith start, probably, and on a moderate trot; while my horse is a fleet one, and - and - we will try it."  - ' :'by this time he had reached a log-house, and barn of the same materials, which fronted a small opening on the left side of the rbad, and 'which was the residence -of a recently-married and here settled friend, in whose care he had left his horse before proceed- igjas On the lady's account he did, through the adjoining wood arid Haviland's broad fields beyond, to the clandestine in erview with her that'we have 'described. And now turning in :owards this rude establishment, he hastily proceeded, without calling at the hoiuse, directly to the barn, that was partially enclosed by one of thofie close-laid, high, pole fences which the settlers usually con. structed round their barns to protect their flocks against the dbpre- dations of wild beasts. Within this strong enclosure, the owner's cattle, consisting of a pair of oxen, cow, and two or three young creatures of the same species, were now quietly chewing their cuds, with those occasional wheezing grunts, which with them sem so indicative of animal enjoyment; while in one corner stood the horse hof which Woodburn was in quest - a little model of a creature, of a lively, attent appearance, as now particularly manifested by a low, earnest, recognizing whinny, and by in- stantly starting off, in a sort of half trot towards the bars of the enclosure, as her master came up on the other side. : tt Yes, yes, Lightfoot, you shall go now, and as fast as you de- sire, this time," responded the latter, throwing himself over the baris, and patting the animal on the neck, as he passed on to the barn for his sad He and bridle. To equip his willing steed, examine the trusty pistols, which, like his foe, he carried about his person, let down, pass through, and ir'pIdhe the bars, occupied him but a moment, and he was about spiniging into is saddle, when, he , s hailed from the house. "Halloo, therse, Woodburn, is tha,:you?" exclaimed a cheerly voice, as a stout-built, crank, honest'looking young man, without hat or coat, canme outof the door,'lnd with a free and careless air made his way towardsthe other;," but what is your hurry? I Nothing unpleasant has befallen you tn your affair over yonder, that makes you feel like being off in this sly and hasty manner, has there?"

OR THE TORYS DAUGHTER.   .29 '"True, sir; but you ask more than I am permitted to; know myself. I can neither get accepted nor rejected. She, howevier,- has given me fresh reason to admire her. She is no common girl, friend Risdon."              l ' There is not a finer or fairer in all the Green Mountans; but what is that fresh reason you name?" "The discovery that at heart she is warmly with us in the good cause. "That is, you hope, and therefore believe so, eh?" "I have a much better reason than that, sir, for my assertion. She has, within this hour, told me so herself." "Ah! Well, then, it is indeed so; for Sabrey Haviland never uttered aught but perfect truth and sincerity in all her life. Why, God bless her for her spunk and independence, living and visiting, as she mostly has, from a child, in that circle of high-toned and bitter tories. And it argues well for your suit, too, Woodburn, which till now I have considered rather an unpromising one; for it tells me that she will struggle hard to get free from the fetters which Peters and her father have fastened on her, and by which, counting on her high sense of the sacredness of all promises and contracts, they suppose have secured her beyond the- least fear of, escape." "Do you allude to any thing other than the mere consent which she formerly gave to Peters's proposals of marriage, and which, I had supposed, constituted the only engagement existing between them?" "Yes, a far stronger case, which I -have learned by way of my wife, since I last conversed with you on the subject." "Ah! What is it?" eagerly demanded the lover. "Why, as I gathered it, the case was this," answered the other, "The old man, as well as Peters, you know, must always do things, if possible, after the English custom; and both thinking more of property than women, they got up a regularly-written marria'ge contract, or settlement, by which one bound himself to give the other his daughter, with suck and such a dowry, anld the other to marry the daughter, and settle such and such sums on her ad her heirs; all to be void in' case the marriage fell through ;yt fault of .the girl. But to provide against this, they made an-otler part to the instrument for her to sign, in which they mad& her solemnly promise and covenant to marry Peters, and none else; otherwise she was to forfeit her birthright in her fathers" estate. I This they somehow or other atlast induced her to sign and$eal;  thus binding herself hand and foot forever, with but one^ single advantage, which, it seems, she had the wit to get added to, t'ie 3' I I    IN   \& -THE RA ERS, ibititiact bef6or she she ould sign it; and that was, that the tlim6 of "rfiillittg the contract, or day of the maririage, was to -be left 'to Air s4 What a detestable conspiracy for a father to enter into against lthe rightful liberty and happiness of a daughter!" exclaimed Woodburn, after a pause, during which surprise and indignation kept h!m silent. "That, then, explains the hints she has several I times thrown -out to me respecting some peculiar trials and diffi- culties to which she was subjected. But was she of age when she 'Signed that paper?  "No; but she probably, in her great scrupulousness, would long hesitate to break the engagement on account of that, or the fraud- tileht means they doubtless used to draw her into the shameful affair. Nevertheless, I would persevere. Her right to stave off the fellow, with her known wish to get rid of him, may yet procure her an honorable release; or she may be brought to take a dif- ferent view about the binding nat ire of a promise obtained under such circumstances; or, as a last resort, that paper may be got taiit of his possession by some scheme or other. So I think you *Ivll worst him in the long run, in spite of his present advantages of the father's help, his own wea-th, and " "And his recent promotion," ir terrupted Woodburn, " which is to be the stepping-stone to the dukedom of Vermont, the reward for betraying his country, and the glittering bait, which, in antici- pation, is already held out to this besieged, but bravely resisting, girl!" "What do you mean, Woodburn?" bluntly said the other, in surprise. i I mean," replied the former, "' that Peters has lately received ta eolonel's commission in the British service, and is even now sisecretly but actively engaged, I suspect, in trying to seduce the people with British gold, and raise troops among us to cooperate With Burgoyne." i "You astonish me. Why, the hypocritical rascal has been - giving out word about here, that, as he had friends and interests bOn both sides, he had concluded to remain neutral!

"He must be nabbed, then; and we will let himi find his duke's coronet in a crow's nest, on the limb of some old hemlock, to which we will soon have him dangling in the air, unless our author- ities wish to give him a more respectable gallows. What say you to that, Harry?" "That you are not the first to think of it - that is, so far as to have him captured. He rode away from Haviland's in this direc- tion, and at a moderate pace, just as I, unperceived by him reached there, about an hour ago, on his way, doubtless, to onei of the tory haunts in Manchester. My mare has a fleet foit, Risdon; so you now understand why I was in a hurry to be off, don't you?" "'I do; but Heavens! Woodburn, you are not going to give chase alone?" "Yes; no horse but mine probably could overtake him before he reaches his associates; besides, since it was hinted to me that he would seek my life, I am willing to give him a chance to take it, where neither he nor I shall have help or witness." "Are you armed?" "With dirk and pistols, as he only is." "A rathetr hazardous pash, Harry. But go, and God prosper you to take him, and with him that mischievous document. And one thing more : if you live to reach Manchester, tell that Coducil of Safety, that if they don't do something soon, we, the :peo. ple, will set up for ourselves in war-making. I,'for one, don't believe I can keep my hands off my rifle three days longer." ' "Ay, ay," said Woodburn, springing into his saddle. "Aiind now, Lightfoot, here is a loose rein for you. Go!" he ladded, striking with his heels the body, and with his hands the m 0aee of ,the impatient animal, that, at these well-understood signs , Eaive an irregular plunge or two ahead, and then shot off like an and*rb  up the road.   I32 A         THE BANGERS, i CHAPTER IIIL "What heroes from the woodland sprung, When, through the fresh-awakened land, The thrilling cry of freedom rung, And to the work of warfare strung The yeoman's iron hand!" LEAVING Woodburn to the hot and eager pursuit that patriotism and private animosity had prompted him to undertake, we will now precede him a few miles on the road, for the purpose of in- troducing and accompanying another old acquair tance, who was also destined to become an actor in the wild and stirring ad- ventures of the night.- Near the southe-n confines of Manchester, about nine o'clock, the, same evening, a youth of the probable age of twenty, of a sandy complexion, and of a rather slight, but evidently tough, wijy frame, with a short rifle on his shoulder, and powder-horn and ball-pouch slung at his back, was making lis solitary way on foot along the main road towards the town just mentioned. As he now reached the Batenkill, where the stream, here first beginning to find a 'more peaceful flow, after its headlong descent from the Green Mountains, intersected the road, he suddenly paused and began to muse, with the air of one who has been struck by some new thought tending to diver, him from his set-led purposes; and, slowly passing on to the bridge, which, after the rude construction of the times, had been thrown across thelriver at this place, he took a seat on one of the side-timbers, or binders, as they were usually termed, and, in accordance with an old and inveterate habit, generated probably by the peculiar circumstances of his early life, began to commune with himself aloud. I I wonder what this new business is they want you should do, Bat? Harry said it was a secret matter when he handed over the paper," he continued, pulling out and abstractedly unrolling a small wad of whi-e paper, " a kinder private commission, or sowrething, which he would explain about, after I had gone and gotlhis letter to the girl, as he met me on my way back. But why don't he meet me fore this time? It's pesky strange he F       t / ** '-    !     OR THE TORY'S. DAUGHTER. shotuld hang back in a woman affair so!

Well, we shan't see mucho more of him to-night, elyi seeing it is love he's doing, and such a moon as this holds'the candle; and we may as well be trying to find out this business without him. So let's be digging out what the paper says. Harry and the rest of 'em don't snow I can read writing; but I can, when driv to it; though I tiink we won't let 'em know that, Bart;' for no knowing what cunning things we may find out if they don't mistrust Iit. Now let's look. Why, I can see as plain as day!" he added, holding- up the writing to the bright moonlight, and beginning to spell out the well-known bold and distinct characters of the secretary of the council, as follows: - "To BARTHOLOMEW BURT:- "You are hereby appointed by the Council of Safety to gd through this and the neighboring towns, bordering on the British line of march; to spy out the resorts of the tories; to marik- and identify all inimical persons; to gain all the informatioi' that can be obtained respecting the movements of the enemy at large; and make report, from time to time, to this council' 0o 4ome field officer of ourtline.

Yes, and then how gentlemanly and re- spectful-like it sounds to be called Bartholomew, in that way.! Bart, we'll go it for them; and have a touch of the trade this very night, if you please. But where shall we begin? Let's see, now.

When Woodburn and Bart left the state, under the circum. s ances described 'in the closing chapters of our first volume, they proceeded directly to Cambridge, where the revolutionary army Mas then gathering for the siege of Boston, enlisted, for two years, into the continental service; and actively participated in a I the most important movements of the army in the campaign tl at immediately succeeded. They were at Bunker Hill, on that memorable day of fire and blood, so glorious for the yeoman patriots of New England, and so fearful for her foes,- "When first, as at Thermopyle, The battle shout of freemen rose; Firm as their mountains, and as free,. They nobly braved encountering foes." And in the following autumn, they, in the same company, in which Woodburn, for bravery and good conduct, had been made a subaltern officer, marched with that division of the army which Arnold, with almost unequalled energy and fortitude, and amidst privation and suffering untold, led through the snow-clad wilder- ness of morass and mountain, to the distant Quebec. And there, in the onset, in which the high-souled Montgomery fell, they were together cut off from their companyand made prison- ers; when, after having, for nearly a year and a half, endured the sufferings of a British prison-ship, they together escaped at Halifax, wandered, half naked and starving, through the seemingly in- terminable forests of Brunswick and Maine, to the American set- tlements, and finally reached home; not there, however, long to repose, but soon to repair, with yet unbroken spirit, to the new scene of action, at which their countrymen were beginning   OR THE TORBYS DAUGHTER.       35 to- rally to meet the formidable invasion of the hitherto victorious Burgoyne. We will now resume the thread of our narrative. A walk of twenty or thirty minutes brought Bart to the log-tenement of Howard, who was a soldier in the continental service, now absent on duty, having left his house and business in charge of his wife, a woman no less noted, in her neighborhood, for energy in con- ducting her domestic affairs, than for the patriotic spirit with ;i  -which she espoused the American cause. She and her daughters a rustic beauty of eighteen, of keen perceptions, and even rare good sense, when her frolicsome disposition would allow her to exercise it, were now the only permanent inmates of this secluded cabin, which consisted of but two rooms, with a front entrance leading through an entry into either of them, and another door at the end of the house opening into the one usually occupied by the family as both sitting-room and kitchen. ( , "A light in both rooms, by the pipers!" exclaimed Bart, as, after having cautiously approached, he paused to reconnoitre the house. "The fellow is there at his traps, as sure as a gun-! Now what's to be done, Bart? 'Twon't do to go in and show yourself, and have that torified scamp carry away word that you are mousing round the country nights, will it? No, but I'll tell -you what, if it want for the name of sneaking and evesdropping, we would creep round back of the room where they be, and hark through the cracks; like enough get a peep, and so learn some. thing. But such things they expected of you, didn't they, Bart? Must be so, I think. Then suppose we throw the name and blame of it on the council, and try it, mister?" Taking a wide sweep round the house, Bart soon approached that part of it, on the back side, in which he rightly conjectured the young people were sitting; and gliding up to the wall with steps as noiseless as those of a mousing fox, he discovered a crevice between the logs, from which the moss calking had fallen out so as to permit a small pencil of light to escape. Guided by this, he quickly gained, after applying his eye to the aperture, a distinct view of the couple within, and was enabled, at the same time, to catch every word of their variously modulated conversa- tion. They were seated at different sides of a light-stand, on X which a candle was burning, she assiduously engaged, to all appearance, with her "needle on some light sewing work, and he no less diligently, with his penknife, on a pine chip, which he was essaying to shape into a human profile, that of his mistress, as might be surmised from the sly glances with which he seemed f  .                  .   36        A  F) - 3 BAFfRS, ^c,'9,.filly to scan her fertes. Tbough now dressed in hip smartest fustian, he yet appeared awkward and ill at 4sq; whiile the timid and hesitating air, with which he seemed to egjrtd. his fair coinpanion, indicated much conscious ucnertainty rjepeting the place he might hold in her affections. She, on the .c wtrary, e eme d .quite self-possessed, and -wore the 4ir of oae not particularly solicitous about pleasing, which gave her as muQh adavantage over him in her manner as she' obviously po- sess d in her person; for, besides a good form and a wholesome roseate bloom, she had one of those polyglot countenances which seem almost to supersede the necessity of speaking- a trait she very prettily exhibited while listening to the forced hints and in- nuendoes of her lover's conversation, as she occasionally lifted her head, now with a blush, now with a smile, and now with a frown, that caused his eyes to drop to the floor as quick as those of A rebuked schoolboy. Thus far, she had not opened her lips; but now, as her suitor, turning in his chair; brought a hitherto shaded xrxn into view, and displayed upon his sleeve a common brass pi, .(usually denominated in those days the Canada pin, as this artifle, then almost excluded from the toilet by the war, rarely fopnd its way into this section except through the intercourse of the tories with that province,) hey attention was suddenly excited; and turning a sharp and searching look upon Wim, she said,- "t Where have you been lately, Josh?" "  Why?" hbe replied, evidently surprised at the question and pianper of the gi;rl. - Tbat, sir," she responded, significantly pointing to the pin. "Such articles don't get here but in one way, in these bard ti mas, which compel us to put up with thorns for pins, and half tories for beaux," she added, with a meaning and roguish look. "Wtnt you accept it, Vine?" he said, obviously disconcerted, but pretending not to understand her allusions. "Not unless you tell me honestly how you got it, sir," she rreplied, .decisively. "O,.picked it up somewhere; don't remember now," he eva- sively answered. "That, .now, is a thumper, I know," she rejoined, with a pretty toss of the head. "But you don't put me off so. The fact is, JIsh, I suspect you have been Honqng the tories to-day. Now be h4n0at,.and tell me, sir." And for the next ten minutes .the determined girl plied her rijetcptt and erplte d qccFpanipn, byall 4 means whih her v.

"Who will be out of reach?" eagerly demanded the other. "The men that my brother Samuel enlisted. You knew heo had got a captain's commission in General Burgoyne's army I 'spose." { We heard so; but has Captain Samuel Rose been in town to-day?"  "Yes; for I may as well tell the whole, now I've begun. The captain has been all day at the house of brother Asa Rose, who lives out of the way, there, in the woods, over beyond the great road, you know. Well, he had agreed-- to meet all he had enlisted in this section tlere at sunset, and lead them off to the British camp, after people were abed. I was there just before dark, and saw them ; sixteen in all, besides the captain, all armed and equipped, and,-he in full uniform; and he looks complete in it, too, I tell you." "But what was you among them there for?" u O, I wanted to see SaMm, and bid him good-by, you know, as he was going off, never to come back, for aught I knew; that was all, upon honor, now." "Perhaps it was; but one thing I wish you to understand, Josh Rose, and that is, if you take up for that side of the question, openly or secretly, your visits here " O, I shan't; no notion on't. not the least in the world; so don't worry; though candidly, Vine, I don't believe it's much use for your folks to think of standing out any longer. Why, hundreds are joining the British every day, and what will be left, in a short time, can do nothing towards stopping such an army as Burgoyne's." "What are left will be apt to try it, I think, sir." The subject was now dropped; and thp girl, after a thoughtful pause, commenced on a theme more agreeable to her suitor, and, for a short time, was unusually sociable and gracious; when she rose, and, carelessly remarking she must' be excused a moment, left the room, and passed out through the front door, with noise enough in opening and closing it,to leave the other in no doubt as to the direction of her exit. 1 - I Well, Bart, what do you think of that?" whispered our lis- tener to himself, as now, on the departure of the girl from the VOL.

"Now, I pretend to' say, I wouldn't take a gold guinea for what we have got through that crack, nor two either, if our legs will carry us to Mhe village and rally help quick enough to have that batch of tories "nabbed before they are off. But let's jest edge along against the mother's room, and see if there is any discovery to be made there, before ; we start." Being equally fortunate in finding an opening into the room to which his attention was now directed, Bart cautiously peered in; when his eye soon fell on the solitary occupant, a fine, resolute- looking matron, quietly employed in knitting by the light of a- torch stuck in one of the stone jambs of the broad fireplace. He, however, had scarcely time to note these circumstances before the door was softly opened, and the girl who had just left the other room entered on tiptoe, and whispered in her mother's ear something that seemed to produce an instant effect on the hitherto sedate and listless countenance of the latter; for, start- ing to her feet, she stood gazing at the other with a flashing eye, and listening with the keenest interest, as some further particu- lars were added to the communication. "Are you sure he was not fooling you?" said the mother. "Very sure," replied the daughter, significantly holding up the Canada pin. "t Well, Vine," rejoined the former, with the air of one whose resolution is taken, " you whip back to your post the same way you came; and see that you keep him here till -say about mid- night," she added, exchanging a meaning glance with the daugh- ter, whose hand was already on the latch to depart. No sooner had the intermingling tones of conversation in the other room apprised the woman that her daughter had there joined the unsuspecting suitor, than, hastily seizing bonnet and shawl, she noiselessly left the house and glided out into the road. After hesitating a moment here, respecting the course she should take, apparently, she made up to the log-fence enclosing an adjoining field, threw herself over it with the lightness of a boy, and, strik- ing off directly west, almost flew over the ground, till she reached the boundaries of their little -opening; when she fearlessly plunged into the dark and pathless recesses of the wood lying between her and the main road, to which she was evidently directing her course. "There! just as I told you," muttered Bart, who, inwardly vexed that the secret he had been hugging, as exclusively his own, should be shared by another, for fear measures might be   asi    UXO TE TOYT DAUGHTERK. -        0 i takin to deprive him of the sole honor and profit he had promisied himself of communicating it, had been jealously noting what had occurred. , Just as I told, Bart; the old woman has got your story, anid there she goes, streaming off with it, like the house-. afire, for the great road, through woods, swamp, and all! Well, it's too late to try to stop her now, to save her the trouble of going, cause you'd frighten her, likely; besides, she'd find out you'd been listening. But we'll follow and keep track of her; may be she'll get lost, and we can cut by her; or may be we can seem to come kinder accidentally on her, and contrive -to get employed to do her errand, and so let her go back." With this resolution, he immediately gave chase ; and by occa- sionally pausing, after entering the forest, to listen to the rustling of her garments as the intrepid woman rushed through the tangled thickets on her way, or the cracking of dry twigs under her rapid tread, he was enabled to trace her course and keep within hearing distance, though not without exertions which drew forth many an exclamation of surprise at the speed with which, at such a time and place, she got over the ground. At length, they both reached the opening on the other side of the forest opposite to a good- sized house on the main road. "I vags," exclaimed Bart, pausing and wiping the perspira- tion from his face with his sleeve, as he emerged from the wood, "if the perlite Frenchman, they tell of, who thought women had no legs, had followed this one through a mile-swamp at the rate she has gone, he would think a little different about the matter, I guess. But never mind the tramp, Bart, but still keep your eye on her. There she goes smack into that house over yonder, which is - let's see, now - Why, that is Major Ormsbee's, who, I remember now, Harry told me, was her brother. Well, Bart, seeing you are fairly beat in this business, let's work along over into the' road against the house, and see what comes of it." Scarcely had Bart gained his proposed situation in a nook of the fence, before the major, followed by his son, came bustling out into the yard.  "Jock!" he said, hastily turning to his son, " you run to the barn, and saddle and bring out my horse, while I slip over-to Captain Barney's. But who have we here?" he added, espying and approaching Bart. "Who are you, friend?" "Well, you may call me any thing but a tory and I won't complain, major." ' "That's right. O, I believe I know you now - the comical chap I have seen with Woodburn, at Warner's encampment, 4c.   "       T HAE BAN6ERS s , Alright. Glad you happen here just at this. time---we have business on hand." "I know it." "' Know it! how? You didn't come with my sister?" "No; after her; but got at the wrinkle about the gang down yonder before she did; and am now on my way to the council, or the camp, with the news." "That I propose to do myself. I have a fleet horse, and it will be best I should go with the news myself. Besides, I wish to put you, with the few others I can raise hereabouts, on the track at once. You shall lose nothing by it; so turn in here, and go with me,." Content with this assurance of an officer known to be in the confidence of the council, and quite willing to make one in the expected affray, Bart cheerfully complied. And the two hurried on to the house the major had named; where, fortunately, they found not only the owner, but another fearless patriot, by the name of Purdy, to both of whom the news just received was communicated; when a hasty plan was devised among them for the capture of Captain Rose and his band of recruits, who, it was supposed, had not yet left the neighborhood, even if they had started from their place of rendezvous. The dwelling of Asa Rose, which had been selected by the tory captain as a secluded and safe rallying-point for his band, was situated in the wood, about three fourths of a mile west of the main road, and the residence, thereon, of the old widow Rose, who has been already mentioned, and who was the mother of a hopeful brood of either open or secret loyalists, as their father, na extensive land-owner, who died about the beginning of the war, was before them. This old establishment of the Rose family, well known through the country as the harboring-place of the disaffected, was a little over a mile from the bridge over the river, at the south, and about half that distance from the residence of Major Ormsbee, at the north, where our handful of spirited friends were now rallying; while from the road, about half way between the two, diverged the path, which wound. round south-westerly to Asa Rose's, and from which the tories were expected to emerge on their way out of the neigh- borhood. 4"Here comes Jock with my -hose," said the major, taking  the reins from the boy, a sturdy youth of sixteen, who had not forgotten to bring his gun with him. "Well, captain," he con- tiSued, leaping into his saddle, "you understand the arrange,   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.    -  41 ment; three of you to take the path to their rendezvous; one to go on to old mooher Rose's, and, if they are there, give the signal; the long howl of a dog, remember; but if they are not there, to join the rest, and scout 'round, watch and delay them;  Xp    while I, on my way, start out'Pettibone and others, and send them directly through the woods to Asa Rose's to get into the rear. All understand, do you?" ( Ay, ay, major." "Well, :then, God prosper you all, till I can get on wit' a platoon of Warner's boys for the rescue." So saying, the major dashed off at full speed towards the village; while Barney and his men, with no less spirit, hurried on to their respective destinations, in the opposite direction. The place where the latter were to separate being soon reached, ap-- pearances examined, and no discoveries made, the captain, with Purdy and young Ormsbee, struck off from the road, and pro. ceeded cautiously along the bushy outskirts of the path before mentioned as leading to the supposed rendezvous, leaving to Bart the task of going on and reconnoitring the old establishment on the main road, at which, it was believed, the tories would be sure to call, on their way out, to take a last treat from mother Rose's ever-ready bottle, and perhaps some provisions from her cup- board, to invigorate them for their long night march to the British camp. A short walk now brought Bart in close vicinity to the house he was appointed to reconnoitre; when, gliding silently along under cover of the fences, tall weeds, and other screening objects, he quickly made a circuit round the buildings, contriving, as he did so, to peer into the barns, sheds, and even into most of the rooms of the capacious old dwelling. He perceived, how- ever, no indications of the presence of any but females about the establishment; though, from the movements of these, and espe- cially those of thei old woman, who was busily engaged in cutting up large quantities of bread and cheese, and in replenishing her: junk bottles, he became satisfied that the company, of whom -he. was in search, were shortly expected. Having made these ob- servations, he retired from the house, crossed over the road into the opposite field, and was marking out a course for himself through the wood, which would intersect the path taken by his companions, and enable him to join them somewhere nearthe tory rendezvous, when his ear caught the clattering of horse. hoofs, approaching, at a furious pace, up the road from the south.; And so rapid was the advance of the coming horseman, that Bart had scarcely time to gain the covert of a clump of shrubbiery 4   ,   * 42         TRE RANGERS, ' standing, by the fence, over against the house, before the former made his appearance, and, turning into the yard, galloped up to an open window, and addressed a hasty inquiry to the mistress of the house; when, hardly waiting for the negative reply that appeared to be given, he suddenly wheeled about, and, regaining the road, pursued his course with renewed speed. "'Why!" exclaimed Bart in surprise, as he caught a view of the man's features; " as sure as a gun, it is Harry's old troubler, that he thought he'd killed once, and felt 'so guilty about it, till he heard he didn't. But what can the fellow be up to here, in such a hurry, just at this time? Don't like the looks on't, exactly. Bart, hasn't this tall tory got wind of our movement, somehow, and come on to warn the gang, that, not finding here, he has gone to meet? Let's be off and try to trace him. But hark! Do you hear that? Another coming from the same quarter! yes, and scratching gravel too, like Mars, I should think, by the way his horse's feet strike the ground! Here he comes! What! it is, by mighty - it's Harry and Lightfoot in full chase! Go it, Lightfoot! Catch him, Harry! Stuboy! stuboy!" he added,.,in low, eager shouts of exultation, as the recognized horseman passed, like a flash, by his place of concealment. Springing forward to a-small elevation in the field, which com- manded a broken view of the road to the path before described, and even a small portion of the latter, Bart tasked both eye and ear to the- utmost, in trying to trace the dimly-discerned forms of the receding horsemen, now obviously but a short distance asunder, his object being to ascertain whether Peters would keep on in the main road, or, as he suspected his intention to be, strike into the path to Asa Rose's, and try to reach the tories before hb should be overtaken. For one moment, in, which he lost sight' of both pursuer and pursued, Bart stood in doubt; but the next, the changing direction of the still audible sounds, and the slight glimmerings of the sparks from the horse's hoofs, now seen extending out in a line nearly at right angles to the course they had been pursuing, sufficiently apprised him that his suspicions were correct. Waiting, therefore, no longer than to ascertain this, he turned and plunged into the wood on his left; and taking the course he had already decided on for joining his companions, and- being now incited to his utmost exertions of speed by his aniety to reach the other road in time to Warn Woodburn of the trap- into which his antagonist was doubtless intending to draw- him at the tory rendezvous, or to be ready to lend any needed- adsince -in case a collision took place between them before    OR THE TORY'S DIUGHTER.       43- eaching it he made his way through the opposing obstacles of the thickets with a rapidity, probably, that a wild Indiani could not have- equalled, till he suddenly found himself in the -path of which he was in quest, within a few rods of the small opening- i  where stood the suspected log-tenement of Asa Rose. His first act now was to stoop down and examine the soft ground in the road, to ascertain whether Peters and his pursuer had passed the place. A moment's inspection, however, confirming him in the, negative, he rose and bent a listening ear in the direction of their expected appearance; but no sounds reached him indicative of their approach. AVhile standing here in doubt respecting the: course next to be pursued, his attention was attracted by a com- motion at the house; when, stepping forward towards the edge of the opening, he caught a glimpse of the whole body of the tories, with their leader at their head, just leaving the house and - moving silently, and with a quickl step, in the road towards him. Stealing softly away from his post of observation, he retreated rapidly along the path, some hundred yards into the wood; when he fortunately encountered Barney and his two men, to whonm he hastily communicated all the -discoveries he had made since he left them. Fearing, from the non-appearance of Peters afts his pursuer, \}   of whom, strangely, nothing had yet been seen or heard -that the former had given the latter the slip in some by-path, which would enable him to reach the tories in the rear, or otherwise apprise them of the danger of proceeding, Bairney instantly- adopted the bold resolution of attempting the immediate capture of the whole band by stratagem, trusting to the firmness and ingenuity of himself and his men to keep, or get them forward, till the expected reenforcement should arrive. "We must multiply ourselves, and then act according to cir- cumstances," he said, after apprising his men of his project, which they eagerly seconded. "I will multiply into a platoon of ten, and .be their orderly,: if you will let me have my own way in the managing- of 'em, captain," said Bart, entering with great spirit into a plan in which his peculiarities so well fitted him for taking a leading part., "Well, then," replied the other, "take a station in the bushes: five or six rods ahead; the rest of us will take our coverts here, on different sides of the road. You must all act for yourselves, apd on -the hints of the moment; but I will take the lead -and: give you such clews as the case may require."      : Scarcely had this fearless little band settled themselves:in:the/ i .I           .   "        .  THE RANGERS, respective stations, before the tories, marching in close Indian file, made their appearance, and came forward wholly unsuspi-     cious of danger. They were permitted to advance unmolested, -till they were nearly all between the two points of ambush; when Captain Barney, stepping partly out from his concealment, presented his gun, and exclaimed, - "Stand! Surrender, or die!" "Halt!" cried the surprised, though not frightened, tory cap-' tain, who was not only a fine-looking, but cool and capable, young officer - ' halt, till we see what all this means." "You will soon find out what it means, unless you surrender," rejoined Barney, in a bold and confident tone. "I give you one minute to decide. Attention there!" le continued, as if address- ing a numerous band of concealed forces --" attention there, right, left, and front platoons! Every man at his station and ready for the word!" Purdy and Ormsbee now made a simultaneous movement in the bushes, on the different sides of the road, by stepping about, hitting their guns against the trees, and thrusting out the muzzles at various openings towards the enemy; while, at the same time, the clicking sounds, as of the irregular cocking of a dozen muss kets, with as many distinct movements of men, apparently, were heard in the direction of Bart's concealment in front. "Stand to your arms!" exclaimed Rose, to his men, who now began to show signs of fear and uneasiness. "Don't all take aim at the captain, you fools!" shouted Bart, from his covert, to his men of straw; "don't do that, I tell you,! There's enough of 'em to furnish each of you a separate mark, nearly. There, that looks more like it! All cocked and ready?" "Hold up there, Sergeant Burt!" cried Barney;!"don't fire yet. Let us spare their lives if we can. Purdy," he continued, turning to the man concealed on his right, " you may give the signal, now, for the -reserve platoons, in front and rear, to ad. vance, and close up on the road. The minute is nearly out, and I perceive we have got to make a demonstration before they will surrender." The signal howl was then accordingly given, and, to the "great joy of the assailants, immediately answered by Pettibone, who, having reached his destination in the rear of the house, and seen the tories decamping, was now, with another man, cautiously advancing towards the scene of action in the wood ; while nearly at the same moment, as it strangely happened, the sharp reports   OR THE TOBRYS DAUGHTER.       45 of three pistols, fired in quick succession, rang through the forest, a short distance, on '-he road to the north. The noise "of firearims, which, to the assailants, portended a rencounter between Peters and Woodburn, and lfilled them with anxiety for the fate of the latter, was taken by the tories as an answer of the signal from the pretended corps in front, and o completed their dismay-that some of them threw down their arns, and began to cry out for quarter. ' The minute is out; shall we fire, Captain Barney? ex- claimed Bart, in a tone of impatience. "Your answer, Captain Rose," sternly demanded Barney- "your answer this instant, or " "I yield," sa'd t? e reluctant tory leader. "We surrender our- selves prisoners of war." "'Tis well, sir," responded the former. "Lay down your arms, then, here in the road, advance twenty paces, and wait further orders."  While this order, which was thus given for the double purpose of enabling the victors to get between the tories and their guns, and to give time' for Pettibone and his associate to come Up, was being carried into effect, Bart, who had been burning with impa- tience for a chance to go to the assistance of his endangered friend, Woodburn, slunk noiselessly from his post, and made' his way, with all possible speed, towards the spot from whence the noise of the firing appeared to proceed. But let us now re:urn to note the issue between the belligerent horsemen. Wo dburn having come in sight of his antagonist soon after crossiag the river, and the latter then taking the alarm, the chase had proceeded, as witnessed by Bart, till the parties struck into the b -road leading to the tory rendezvous; when the former, concluding t at Peters would not have turned in here without the exp ctazion of finding friends and defenders near, nowredoubled is exertions to overtake him, and bring on, an encounter while it would have to be decided by individual prow- ess, and before 1is foe should reach assistance to render the pur- suit futile or dangerous. But notwithstanding his efforts, he son lost sight of the other in the short turns of the winding and thickly- embowered path which they soon entered. Expecting, however, that the next turn in the road would reveal the object of his pur- suit, he dashed ahead some distance ; when, becoming satisfied that his antagonist nad given him the slip by riding out of the road. into some nook or side-path in the wood, he retraced his way nearly. to the opening,- vainly endeavoring to discover the concealment of the fugitive. Vexed and disappointed at being   A46         THE RANGERS, thus balked, Woodburn was on the point of giving up ti-e chase, when he caught a glimpse of the other, emerging from a thicket into the road, not a hundred yards distant, and, setting off'on a gallop in the direction first taken. Incited to fresh exertion, Woodburn now shot forward after his flying foe with a velocity which none but a horse trained to the rough paths of the wood could equal, and which, consequently, soon brought the parties in close vicinity of each other. Peters, now seeing no further chance to escape, suddenly pulled out a pistol, and, turning in his saddle, discharged it at Woodburn, who, wholly unharmed by the badly-aimed instrument, instantly returned the fire. The bullet of the latter, grazing the person of the former, entered the head of his startled and rearing horse, just back of the ears, and, after two or three fearful plunges onward, brought himn to the ground. Leaping from his falling horse, the desperate loyalist gained his feet and discharged another pistol at Woodburn; when, perceiving his opponent still unhurt, and about to make a rush upon him, he leaped over the body of his dying horse, still floundering in the edge of the bushes, and, in the noise thus oc- casioned, and in the screening smoke of his own fire, made good his escape into the forest. "Come back, miscreant! coward!" shouted Woodburn, dis- mounting, and leaping forward to the placewhere the other had disappeared --" come back, and decide your fate or mine." But the new-made tory colonel, who was more a coward from conscience than nature, in the present instance, perhaps, did not see fit to accept the challenge for a further personal combat. And Woodburn:, judging that any attempt to pursue him in the woods would be useless, reluctantly gave up the chase, and turned to go back to his horse; when Bart, running up and peering an instant at the dying horse and then at his friend, rushed by the latterj and, throwing himself on the neck of his loved ponyfell to hugging and fondling her in an ecstasy of delight. O Lightfoot! Lightfoot!" he exclaimed; "lucky divil that you are, not now to be sprawling and kicking, like your tory brother there in the bushes! Yes, that you are, Lightfoot; and you shall have an oat-supper to-night that would make a horse laugh, foricatching up with the rapscallion." -," Bart!:" said Woodburn, in surprise; "how did you get wind of this? But no matter. You- have come too late." : Know; it - couldn't help it, though--had other fish to fry first,: that musn't cool. Captain Rose and sixteen other tory pris. oners are on the road here, just below.'   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.        4  "Prisoners! how? By whom taken?    ' - . - ; ; ? "O, Captain Barney, and Bart, and I, and Mr. Stratagem, and- one or two others."      .  "What, only three or four of you to seventeen?" "No; I was ai flanking party of ten in the bushes, and sar- geant of 'em - cocked all their guns for 'em, by cocking and, uncocking my own -talked for 'em all, out of seven corners of my mouth at once, and kept 'em from firing till the word, you know. We heard your firing, and called you the front-guard ; and - and we took 'em - every d(g of 'em." "Bravoes! and no fool of an exploit on your part neither,?, Bart, if all this is so. But are the prisoners secured? Had we not better hasten to join the escort?" "No, two or three more came up just as I left, and there's enough now to manage in that quarter; but the advance-guard here must be kept up till we get 'em out to the great road, lest the sneaks slink away into the woods as they pass along the r4ad, and slip through our fingers as your smart trooper did just now. Let's see--about eight strong we will have this guard, I guess.- I will be rank and file, and you shall be the officer. Come,- mount! They'll be poking their heads along in sight in a moe- ment. Ay, there they come! Advance-guard!" he now added, in a loud, commanding tone, as the slow tread of the prisoners, advancing along the devious and closely-embowered path, became audible -" advance-guard! Attention the whole! Prepare to march! march I                    - And accordingly he then, as Woodburn mounted and rode. slowly on behind, commenced the enactment of his assumed part, always keeping within hearing, but never within distinct view, of: the prisoners; now jabberrig in as many voices as the most ex,; pert ventriloquist, and now sternly commanding, "Silence in: the ranks!"- now getting up a seeming scuffle among his men, and:. now driving them, with thwacks and curses, to their places; and. now again softening his tones and cracking jokes with his men,-- Smith, Johnson, &c.,-who, in as many different tones, were heard: to return various sharp and comical retorts, which raised sho0uts! of laughter and made the forest ring with the sham merriment4- And thus he proceeded, to the secret amusement of the victors,. all of whom perfectly understood the artifice, till they emerged from the woods into the open grounds on the main road, when: they were met by Major Ormsbee with a small detachment oft regular soldiers. The tories were then, for the first time, per-, mitted to know the smallness of the force that had captured them;.   , 8       z .  -- TogE RANGERS,  when, amidst showers of gibes and shouts of laughter, at their ex- pense, from the Grten Mountain Boys, the chapfallen creatures were wheeled into the rnain road, and hurried on at a lively pace to the village of Manchester, to be kept as prisoners of war, or tried as spies, as the higher authorities there should see fit to decide.* -.4Captain Woodburn!" exclaimed the clear, animated voice of one coming out of the door of the honored tavern before described, in the village of Manchester, as the person thus addressed, who had just arrived with those escorting the prisoners, was describing the capture to a crowd gathered round him in the yard -"Captain Woodburn, your most obedient! I am glad my patience in waiting for your arrival is rewarded by the good news which Powell, our landlord here, has just told us you bring. But come, sir, L word in your ear, if you please." Woodbumrn turned and confronted the bright and smiling coun- tenance of Ira Allen. who was beckoning him from the crowd. "Certainly, Mr. Allen; but why honor me with that appella- tion?" responded the former, stepping aside with the ardent young secretary. , Because I have the warrant for so doing in my pocket-a captain's commission for you, my dear sir, if you will believe me." "1 Indeed!"'- ,' Yes, we have done something in the council at last worth talking about--voted to raise a regiment of Rangers forthwith, and appointed all the commissioned officers, Samuel Herrick head- ing the list as colonel." This band of tories were, the next day after their capture, marched to Arlington, where the question was raised, and sharply discussed, whether they should be considered as prisoners of war, or tried as spies, the latter being in1isted on by MVathew Lyon, and some others of the more bold and ardent friends of the American cause, who declared that Captain Rose, at least, should be tried and hung as a spy. A jury, however, --Eli Pettibone, Esq., presiding as civil magistrate,-- was allowed the prisoner; when, more probably, from sympathy for the manly but misguided young officer, whom they had known as a pleasant neighbor, than from want of proof, he was acquitted as a spy, and, with the rest of his band, removed to Northampton jail as prisoner of war. Considerable favor, also, seems to have been ex- tended to the other brothers, some of whom married alto whig families, through whose influence, it is said, they retained their estates, none of the extensive Rose property being confiscated, except that of Captain Samuel Vr ose, which is now the residence of the Hon. J. S. Pettibone, from whom these particulars have been obtained, his father being one of the captors, mand his uncle the magistrate, aboveinamed.   r             OR THE:  TOR'S?

By to-morrow night many of those on our black list will " "Your black list?"  "Yes, already mostly made out for operations. But what -is there to startle you in that?" "Nothing; and yet I cannot forbear asking if that list includes one in whose family you may guess I feel some interest." "I fear so, and regret that the proofs are so strong as to require it." C Gou d not action in that case be deferred? An angel is plead- \    ing with him to remain neutral." "If she were a whig angel, Woodburn, I know not-- " "She is, she is- firmly, devotedly." "Indeed! Well, for your sake, Woodburn, I am glad of it. And as the political hue of petticoats has already been permitted to have an influence, in some instances of the kind, in making up the list, it may have in this case. But the old man's enmity to our cause is so notorious, that I fear his estate must go, though the daughter, if she prove true, will not be forgotten on the question of a future restoration of her share of the property. But I am neglecting my chief business with you. We have fixed your present destination for the other side of the mountain, where among your old acquaintances, it was thought, you could raise a company most expeditiously." "But where is the money to come from to pay my recruits? Even in case these estates are sold, who among us, these times, has money to purchase them?" "The answer to that question involves a secret which is known to but a :ew of us, and which must not be further revealed. Suf. fice it that there is yet among us abundance of money, besides the British gold that is beginning to be scattered along our border, to meet our present requirements.

"You have laid me under deep obligations to you, Mr. Alien, for all this," began Woodburn, with grateful emotion. "Yes, to do well; but not a word of thanks will I hear. So off with you to your rest. Begone, sir!" said Allen, pushing the other away, with that winning smile and kindly playful manner, with which he ever so wonderfully contrived to gain the hearts and control the actions of all whom he wished to make friends. ,- ' '   *    . J   ,I            OR THE TORY S DAUGHTER.       53] CHAPTER   IV. "It is not much the world can give With all its subtle art; And gold and tank are not the things To satisfy tt e heart." THE day following the occurrences noted in the precedinl chapter was an eventful one to the Haviland family, developin{ circumstances calculated to hasten the crisis to which the con flicting feelings and conduct of the father and daughter had bee, for sonre time silently tending, and, to give a new turn to- thei respective destinies. 1.{     It was late in the afternoon. No event had thus far during I\    the day occurred to mar the usual tranquillity of the family; ani Haviland, yet uninformed of the untoward affair which befell hi party the last evening at Manchester, and little dreaming of the bold and decisive measures adopted by the Council of Safety was seated at a table in his usual sitting-room, examining, with- satisfied and triumphant air, a map of New York, on which h was tracing out the intended route of the British army in it hitherto victorious way from the St. Lawrence to Albany. A length he began to muse a'oud, partly to .himself, apparently and partly to his daughter, who, with a pensive brow, was seate( at an open window in the same room, quietly engaged with he needle-work. "As soon as General Burgoyne can clear the road of the tree and other obstructions, with which the rebels, in their impoter 'spite, have filled it, so that he can move on to the Hudson, hot that grand army will sweep away the feeble and undiscipline bands that may venture to oppose its victorious march! An when a junction of the British armies is formed at Albany, whb can this infatuated people th'nk of doing then? With the nort completely cut of from the south, as will then be the case, w'h can these two sections, which together can hardly raise a respec table force, do, when thus divided and prevented from all conce] and cooperation?. Ay, what will they do then? Come, Sabrey, he added, turning with an exulting air to his daughter, " pehal i              I             .    -8          TiM RANGERitS, you, who appear to have so high Ian opinion of rebel prowess- perhaps you can answer the question " "I may be better prepared to answer the question, perhaps, when 1 see the junction you anticipate really effected. Burgoyne has not reached Albany yet," replied the other, with playful sig- nificance.         i "Be sure not; but what is to revent him? What force can the rebels oppose that he will not scatter like chaff before the wind? None! I tell you, girl, their doom is sealed!" "It might be, if they would cor sent to let you fight their battles for them, father. But the battle which they are preparing to give Burgoyne they will choose Io fight themselves, I imagine. A few Bunker Hill lessons, on his way, might materially alter the general's prospects." "' Bunker Hill? Pooh! Why, we routed them even there, behind their breastworks. Besides, we never had so fine an army as this in the field before. 1l only wish I was as sure of some good commission in Burgoyne's army, as I am that he will march triumphantly through to Albany, and thus bring this un- natural war to a close." "Would you. think of going into that army, father, should you receive such an appointment?" asked the daughter, in a tone of surprise and expostulation. "Why, I should be proud to be there, Sabrey, in an army that contains so much of the first talents and chivalry of Eng- land."                     I At this stage of the conversation, a man rode up to the door, e and, dismounting- and entering the house, handed to Mr. Haviland, after inquiring his name, a gorgeously-sealed packet. Haviland, after examining the seal a moment, bowed low to the stranger, and inquiringly observed,- "From General Burgoyne, I believe?" The messenger, nodding in the affirmative, and saying he was directed to wait for an answer, the former broke open the missive, and found in it, by singular coincidence, an answer to the prayer he had a few moments before indirectly uttered; a commission, or appointment in the commissary department of the British army. After perusing the paper a second time, he turned, and, with a consequential air, handed it to his daughter, whose countenance instantly fell as she glanced over the suspected contents. ',You cannot seriously think of accepting this appointment, fatherr' she said, with a look of concern; " you cannot think of      .        OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       58 i eaving your quiet and comforSable home, and engaging, at your ge, in the fatigues and dangers of the camp?" "TWhy not, Sabrey?" replied the other, reprovingly. "From ny knowledge of the country, I can be of great use in procuring he supplies which "the army will need, as the general doubtless bresaw; and I consider it my duty to the king to lend my feeble id when called. The post 's not, it is true, a very high one; 1ut it is honorable and lucrative, and I shall accept it." If this is Miss Sabrey Haviland, I have a letter for her also,'" Mere interpbsed the messenger, rising and presenting the letter in uestion.  Sabrey broke open the proffered letter, which proved to be from her friend Miss McRea, and ran thus;- 'I You remember your pro-nise, Sabrey, to visit me the first opportunity. That opportunity now occurs. Captain Jones and their friends have presented your father's name at head-quarters for promotion; and he has now, I am informed, received an appointment. If he accepts, as I am sure he will, I hope you will accompany him, and remain with me. I have just received one of those letters so precious to me : he says the army will prob- ably move on to Fort Edward next week, the obstructions in the road being now mostly removed ; so that, by the time you arrive, I shall probably be enabled to introduce you to the beau. tiful and accomplished ladies of whom he has so much to say, a uc' as the Countess of Reidesel, Lady Harriet Ackland, and thers, who accompany their husbands in,the campaign. But ou will perhaps say that he is interested in praising these ladies ]r the love and heroism which prompt them to brave such fatigues and dangers for the sake of their lords, since he- is armly urging me to consent to an immediate union, that I may '   a1llow their example. He says, in his last letter,--and I think tuly,--tht I cannot long remain where I am, in a section which, Le evidently anticipates, will soon become a frightful scene of. strife and 3loodshed; and that I must therefore go away with my friends, and leave him, pethaps: forever, or put myself under tis Protection in the army. And he seems hurt that I hesitate in a choice of the alternatives. On thefother hand, my connections and friends here think it would be little short of madness in me tv yield to my lover's proposal. The people about here -are greatly alarmed at the expected ap roach of the British army, rhich is known to be accompanied iby a large body of Indians. any are already removing, and nearly all preparing to go. i   54          TE 'RARNGERS, The crisis hastens, and yet I am undecided. Prudence points one way, love the other. What shall I do? O Sabrey, what Shall I do? Should you come on with your father, I think I should feel a confidence in going with you to the British encamp- tmient. Come then, my friend, come quickly; for I feel as if I could not go without friends, and especially a female friend, to accompany me; while, at the same time, I feel as if some irre- sistible destiny would compel me to the attempt. And yet why should I hesitate to- take any step which he advises? Why refuse to share with him any dangers which he may encounter? And why should my anticipations of the future, which have ever, till recently, during my happy intimacy with Mr. Jones, been so bright an-d blissful, be clouded now? I know not; I know not why it should be so ; but lately my bosom has become disturbed by strange misgivings, and my mind perplexed by dark and unde- fined apprehensions. I must not, however, indulge them; and your presence, I know, would entirely dissipate them. I repeat, therefore, come, and that quickly. Adieu. "Yours, truly,        JANE MCREA." The messenger in waiting, having been invited into another room to partake of some refreshment, and the father and daughter being thus left again by themselves, the latter now handed the other for his perusal the affectionate but too truly boding letter of her fated friend. "And what answer do you intend to return to this kind and 'pressing invitation of your friend, Sabrey?" asked Haviland, after attentively reading the epistle. 4' That I do not -think it advisable to accept it, at this time, father," answered the girl. "Why not advisable?" asked the other, in a censorious tone. "I see nothing to object to in the step, going, as you will, under the protection of a father; while it will introduce you to a circle which few American girls can ever reach." "' I feel quite willing to forego the honor of such an introduc- tion," coolly returned the daughter. "And were it otherwise, the very letter that brings me the invitations unfolds enough to deter me from the undertaking." "You wholly mistake your friend's meaning," responded the former. "Her apprehensions are merely the natural effect of Wmaiden timidity. I think, as her lover seems to do, that the ifest place for her is with the British army. So I think it will boe for you; for I know not what punishment will be inflicted on   [f '*    OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.          h  I   thisse settlements for their rebellious and treasonable conduct. Ad it is my wish to separate myself and family from them, be- fre -.he day of reckoning arrives. I shall, therefore, expect you to at end me."     l , As the daughter was about to reply, a domestic came in and ai noJnced the arrival of Colonel Peters; and the latter, the next moment, with a dark and sullen brow, unceremoniously entered the apartment. He did not, however, deign immediately jto un- fold the cause of his evident ill-humor, but contented himself with listening to the news, which the elated Haviland was prompt tc impart in relation to his own promotion, the invitation received by his daughter to accompany him to the army or its vicinity, and his thus far rejected advice to her to accede to the proposal.. The cold countenance of Peters brightened with selfish delight a! the recital; for in the old gentleman's appointment, his de. tormination to accept it, and his intention of taking his daughter ith him, if she could be so persuaded, the former saw the tri- umph of his machinations to involve the family inextricably in t te royal cause. But that triumph would not be complete, unless t e daughter, whose predilections for Woodburn and the Ameri- n cause were more than suspected, could be kept within -the sope of loyal influence. He therefore secretly resolved that, i her father left the settlement to join the army, she should not ileft behind, but should be induced or compelled to. accompany }im. He consequently was not slow to add his advice and en- tiea-ies to those of the father. This he did for a while With s Vme show of respect and kindness; but finding her still im- ovable, he at length became irritated, and assumed a tone 0ft "itation so inconsistent with the natural delicacy of a lover, that s e declined any further conversation with him on the subject. "Where will you go, perverse and blinded girl?" now inter- osed the father, reproachfully. "You would not stay here alone nd unprotected, would you?" s"I should not hesitate to do so on account of any molestation hich American troops would offer me," replied Sabrey, with 'a significant emphasis on the word American. "And should others approach, I would go to my connections on the other side of the mountains."        ' "Miss Haviland may have her private reasons for wishing to remain itn this section of the country," said Peters, with an il.. suppressed sneer, turning to the father. : Will you please explain your meaning, sir? demanded the girl with spirit  :-.                :   5^      .  m ) r THE RANGERS, "Imean," replied Peters, " that she who would hold clandes tine meetings with one whom her father has seen fit to eject from his house, might see the advantage of remaining where her inter- views could be enjoyed without molestation." -Sabrey Haviland, is that true?" asked the old gentleman, with a gathering frown. "She will hardly deny, I think," said Peters, "that the fellow was here soon after I left last night. At all events, he was seen to leave the premises in pursuit of me. By whom he was in- formed of the direction I took, I know not; but I know he over- took me, beset me like a ruffian, and shot my horse by a ball intended for the rider." "' Is all that true, I repeat?" again fiercely demanded Haviland of his daughter, in a burst of rage. But without deigning one word of reply either to the insulting in- sinuations of Peters, or the angry and ill-timed demand of her father, Sabrey, with cheeks glowing with offended delicacy and just indignation, rose from her seat, and was about to leave the apart- ment, when her step was arrested by the altered voice of hier father, who, quickly becoming sensible of the harshness of his conduct from its visible effects, now spoke to her in a softened and more expostulatory tone. "Surely, Sabrey, you are not going to deny my right, as a parent, to question you, or at least ask you for an explanation -respecting charges which have the appearance of involving your character?"  "I might not," said she, coolly, but respectfully; "and in- deed, I should not, at another time, have refused to answer your question so far as I could, however harshy it was put to me; but I must still decline to do so in this presence!" she added, glancing towards the abashed Peters, with an air of scorn to which her usually serene and benignant countenance never be- Ifore, perhaps, ga ve expression. -"6 Perhaps, Miss Haviland," said Peters, stung by the-remark and manner of the other, and now rallyinglfor the revenge to which such minds are prone to resort - " perhaps Miss Haviland, on a little more reflection, may be willing to acknowledge that Il, also, am not wholly without a right to ask for an explanation in an affair which she seems to admit requires one." "-I am not, aware, sir," promptly responded the maiden, so much aroused by the cool arrogance of the other, 'as to forget her determination to hold no more conversation; with him--LIT am not:aware, sir, of having admitted any necessity of an explanation'.   OR THE TOR S bATGHTER. "T    -. And had I done so, I should be very far from acknowledging your right to require it of me." - It is possible," rejoined the former in the same strain--" it is possible Miss Haviland may be willing to qualify her last remark a little, when she is reminded of the existence of a certain mar- riage contract, to which she voluntarily became a party." "I need no prompting to make me mindfiul of that evidence of my youthful indiscretion, sir," responded Miss Haviland; 1" nor. should I be likely to forget the particular provisions of an instru,-; ment, the thought of which has cost me, as my entreaties to be: released from it should have apprised you, so many painful regrets. But, while mindful of all this, I hav/ yet to be informed of the provision which, till the contract is consummated, gives you any control over my actions, or right to require me to account for or explain them." "' If the instrument, which I have somewhere about me, I be- lieve; , replied the other, with his usual cold indifference, as: he took the document from his pocket, add began, with a business- ' like air, to glance over the contents-'" if the instrument does not express,: or ratter if it is not admitted to presuppose and give me, any of ttle rights I have named till it is consummated,. then it is time that I should insist on its consummation, which, as few others would have done, I have so long forborne to: urge."                          , "I perfectly agree with Colonel Peters," interposed Mr. Hay-f iland, catching at tie last suggestion in his growing alarm for the success of his favorite scheme, which the unexpected state of feeling here displayed taught him might be endangered, ifi not  speedily conjsummated. "I perfectly agree with him, that this business has. already been sufficiently delayed; and I think, ax:t:i the family is now about to break up, that the final ceremony has ] better be performed before we go, or, at the farthest, when we: reach the army, wnere; as Sabrey would perhaps prefers it might take place at -he same time as that of her friend, who is similarly situated." "You forget," said the maiden, now freshy aroused at thii; combined attempt to make her forego her last remaining privilege: in the abhorrent negotiation-"you both forget that the very instrument, by which you claim to dispose'of my hand, expressly leaves to me, and too me only, the right and privilege of deciding upon the:.time for that ceremony, by which you would now,-it  seems, so summarily consummate your unmanly scheme. And  : thank Heaven!" she continued, turning to the nonplused suitor, I   ,   ,                 . + - Bi   :58     [    THE RANGERS, with an air of decision and fearlessness which the excitement of insulted feeling could only have given her -" thank Heaven, I had the forethought to insist on a privilegei now so precious to me; for let me assure you, sir, that distant Wvill be the day when I shall fix on a time-- for consummating a contract, wrung :rom girlish inexperience, to gratify selaish ambition or mistaken views, in the first place, and now claimed to hold me like a sold article -of merchandise, for the use and control of one whose feel'ngs, principles, and whole character are every vWay uncongenial with my own.1! C What! - how!" exclaimed ;he irritated and evidently aston- ished Haviland, who, in his obtuseness, even now, could not per- ceive what objection his daughter could have; to a match esteemed by him so advantageous. "WI at can this mean? Why, the girl must be ;demented! You to decide on the time! Why, reasonable time is all that was meant by that, if it is not so -ex- pressed!"              I "That is all; nothing more," eagerly chimed in Peters. "If a part of the instrument isi to be construed differently from what is expressed, and as you choose, why not other parts, and as I choose?" calmly asked the unmoved girl. "If so, then its power to bind me shall cease with this hour."' "What folly'!" again exclaimed the old gentleman, balked and chafing worse than before. "W^y, don't thie infatuated girl know that, to say nothing about losing prospects which no other young lady in the country would rejeqt-that by marrying any other man, she will forfeit her birthright in my estate, and make her- self, as she will deserve to be, a beggar?" 1I have no thought of marrying any other man while in my present embarrassing position," quickly retorted the former, with an offended air. "But should I wish to do to, I should- hardly be deterred from it by either of the considerations you have -just named, I think. And, indeed, if the mercenary and ambitious motives, which you would have actuate mei were alone to be my guide in such a step, I could see but little temptation for the sacri- fice- in the hornors And wealth which are so much to depend on a triumph that, for all your boasts, I believe will never be! accom- plished; while the failure, if the same justide is meted out to you which you seem to be meditating for others, will leave you with a branded name, and no estate here to give or withhold.". "Silence! audacious girl," exclaimed the baffled loyalist, un- able longer to endure the calm but scorching rebuke involved in the reply of his daughter. "I will listen to no more of your *          \ )-   w       . . -OR THE TORY S DAUGHTER.    -59 railings. This comes of being allowed to mingle with an ignorant, r*   rebellious populace. / But that evil shall, at least, be remedied. You will attend me to the army, where, I trust, your eyes may soon be opened to your folly." ,    "You may perhaps compel me to go, sir," responded the still unawed maiden; " but if you do so, let me warn you against all hope of thereby rendering my feelings less repugnant to the scheme we have been discussing, or of changing my views of the cause in which you are about to embark; for I will now openly declare, what I have often before left you to infer, that I have no sympathies for those who come to oppress and enslave my country; nor will I ever aid or sanction their ignoble purposes - not even to the withholding any intelligence I may gain of their movements, which may avert disaster or peril from our struggling people."                     /I "Hurrah for the tory's daughter!" now burst on. the ears of the astonished group, from a band of armed men standing imme- diately beneath the open but thickly vine-clad windows without, whither, it seemed, they had approached unperceived, and thus become unintentional listeners to the last part of the foregoing dialogue, which they were still hesitating to break in upon, when their admiration of the heroic girl's declarations led. to the irre- pressible burst of applause just mentioned - "Hurrah for the tory's daughter! She shall be remembered for that!" The party within instantly rose to their feet at so strange and unexpected a salutation. Peters, aware, from the experienceof the last night, that his capture was sought, was the first, as might be expected, to take the alarm. With a hasty step towards the window, and an equally hasty glance through the screening foliage at the new-comers, he hurriedly retreated through a door leading to the rear of the house. Haviland, scarcely less alarmed, though having no conception of the main object of the visit, advanced, with evident perturbation, to the front door, when he was met at the threshold by the secretary of the Council of Safety, who, bowing politely, proceeded to apologize for the noisy outhreak of his attendants, which, contrary to his wishes, he said, had been made to announce his arrival. "Attendants, sir?" exclaimed Haviland, casting a flurried glance at the file of soldiers in the yard - " attendants - armed men led up here to my door? Who are they? What is their business, and yours, sir? This affair needs explanation, sir."; ^Well, sir, if so, I am here to -give it," composedly replied; Allen. "But, as you appear somewhat agitated, let us walk in and talk over the matter calmly."    - sE         T.-' BANsfIERp^  ,l aMn, :icaly cplyijg with the suggestion, Haviland turned :md led the way into the room, where his daughter still stood, mutely awaiting the development; when the secretary, after bowing with marked respect to Miss Haviland, with whom, it appeared, he was slightly acquainted, resumed,- ' aThe Council of Safety, sir, having determined on defending the: state to the, last extremity, in the present crisis, have per- cieved, with deep regret, that there are those in our midst who hesitate not either to take up arms against their countrymen, or, what- is no better, secretly to aid the enemy, and harbor and con- ceal in their houses hostile emissaries, trying to seduce ou- peo. ple. And not perceiving the policy or justice of longer permitting their cause thus to be endangered., the council have decided on a measure for promptly remedying the evil --a measure which they had less hesitation in adopting, as they believed, fromn the irepeated threats of the loyalists, they would only be anticipating their opponents by inflicting penalties, that, in case of the con- quest of this country, will be visited on themselves. They have passed a solemn decree, sir, to confiscate, for the public use, all the estates of both of the classes of loyalists I have named, among oine of which, at least, they have abundant proof, I regret t: say, !to warrant them in classing Esquire Hav iland. And they direct -ine to permit him to take one of the horses, lately- his own, and depart, with the least possible delay, for the British camp, where, they think, he more properly belongs." The arrogant loyalist, who had hitherto looked upon the Coun-. cil of Safety with utter contempt for either their powers o- their efficiency, was now perfectly thunderstruck at- the announcement of so bold and unexpected a measure; and, for some moments, his mouth seemed wholly sealed against any remonstrance to a step which, not for public good, but for his own aggrandizement, he was consciouslof intending to recommend to the British goiern- ment in relation to the estates of the leading rebels, and especially those- of the treasonable body by whom, as had just been so truth- fully told him, his selfish designs had now been anticipated. Soon rallying, hcwever, he wrathfully muttered,- L"They dare not do it; their audacity will not carry them to that length. But if :hey do," he continued, with louder and more menacing tones --- if they do attempt to carry out their plunder- ing purposes, I will bring down upon them, within eight and forty hours, a British force that will give them enough to do to take caro' of themselves and their own property, without meddling with that of others."    OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER. "That is what we supposed you would be glad to do, in any ": case," quietly responded Allen. "' It but swells the proof against: I-  you, and goes to confirm the justice of the decree."  "O, do not say any more, father," interposed Miss Haviland, with much feeling. "Do not, I beg of you, further and more inextricably involve yourself. You know how gladly I would; have saved you from this; how often warned you of the ;conse- quences of persisting in your course. Perhaps it is not too late to retract, even now. Who knows but the council, who have done this but from a sense of duty to their country, and with no ill- will against you personally, may yet be induced, if you will send in a pledge of neutrality, to reverse their sentence as regards, you, and still leave you in possession of your property and a quiet home? I myself, feeble girl as I am, would go before them to intercede for you; and perhaps this gentleman would assist me," she added, with an appealing glance to Allen. :"Most gladly," replied the latter, touched at the magnanimity" of the-girl, in her distress--" most gladly, and with great h6pe of success." t 4"Do you hear that, father?" said the other, eagerly; "do you hear what I -feel --I know - may yet be dorie for you? Then do not reject my petition, but retract, and give up your intention; of joining these invaders of your country." No," replied the old gentleman, after a moment of appa-. rent wavering --" no, never! Let the plunderers take posses- sion of my estate here for the short time they will be enabled' to hold it, if they will. To-morrow morning I start for the British, camp." "It is as I feared," observed Allen, turning to the daughter'; "but your efforts to rescue your father, Miss Haviland, and the' noble stand you have taken on this occasion and before, are, let m me assure you, appreciated by myself, and will not fail to be so by those of more controlling influence. And although this prop- erty will, in a few days, be sold by those duly appointed, anid now here to-guard and dispose of it, yet the government, which has the power to confiscate, will have the power to restore; and I have no fears that your own interests will eventually be made to suffer by a measure which may now appear as harsh to you as it appeared necessary to the upright and patriotic men who felt themselves constrained to adopt it. In this you may trust, I think, as regards the future. As for the present, I am only em- powered to offer you an asylum in some friendly family of the t:l neighborhood, with ample means of support, or, if you prefer, a;- I  ,6 .   THE RANGERSt,              ? safe coveyance, with a female attendant, should you desire it, to any family in a more distant part of the state."  , t My daughter will probably go with me, sir," said Havi- land, resentfully. ' " No, father," said the girl, firmly; " that army is no proper place for a young -lady, and especially one of my views. I shall, for the present, go into the family of our neighbor Risdon ; but in a few days, I will gratefully accept of Mr. Allen's offer of a conveyance, and, as I proposed to you a short time ago, go to my connections on the other side of the mountains." " Your wishes will be attended to in this or any other respect as soon as you shall please to signify them, Miss Haviland," said the secretary, as, bowing a respectful adieu, he now departed, with part of his armed attendants, for other and similar visits, which remained to be accomplished that night among the unsus- pecting tories of that vicinity. Within an hour or two after the departure of Allen, or as soon as the growing darkness would enable a skulker to approach un- seen, a man, who was of the latter description evidently, might have been discovered slowlv and cautiously making a circuit round the house, but at so respectable distance from it as to escape the observation of the guard now stationed at three or four commanding points about the premises. When he had reached a point nearly opposite to the back door, he ventured up to the border of the intervening garden, and gave a low, significant whistle. After a momentary silence, a slight rustling was heard in a thick patch of corn occupying a portion of the garden, and Peters, who, it will be recollected, passed out in this direction, and who, perceiving his retreat cut off by men already posted in the fields, had here lain concealed till now, cautiously emerged from his covert, and came forward to the spot where the other -stood awaiting his approach. " Well, Redding," said Peters, in a low voice, as he came up, " " when I asked you this morning to come here to Haviland's to- night to see me, before I went to the army, I didn't exactly ex- pect you would have to call me out of a corn patch to receive my orders. But how came you to know or suspect I was here ? You have not ventured in there, I take it ?" he added, leading ?   the way into the field, which the guard had now left. "No," replied Ithe other; " I caught a glimpse of the fellows in the yard as I came in sight, and, mistrusting what was to pay, .  from what I had just heard of their movements this forenoon in I Manchester, and other towns thereabouts, I struck off across the   OR THE TORYS -DAUGHTER.       6p pasture, where I luckily encountered the old squire, who walked out there, after the leader of the gang had left, and who told me of your concealment, and all." "Yes, he came to the back door, here, the first chance he could get, to see if I had escaped, when, contriving to apprise htim where I was, I had got a noment's talk with him just before. But what have you heard about their movements in other places to-day?"                       q "Why, I met Asa Rose going post-haste to warn our friends in this direction to be on their guard. He says they have seized on -the estates of all the Rose family, and every other leading loyal- ist, as far as they could hear, in all that section; and, in several instances,.put the owners themselves under guard. What do you say to all that, colonel?" "Glad of it. Though an act of lawlessness and audacity which I did not once dream of their attempting, and which, even now, they will not dare to carry out, should they have time to do so before their brief career is arrested, yet I am glad the rebel fools have done it; for, between you and me, Redding, I have had my doubts whether the British government, which is ever too merciful, would take their estates from them, when we come to subdue them, as-you know we have talked; but now vengeance will be swift and certain. Their estates will all be seized and given to the deserving."                . "Ay, that's it!" exclaimed the perfidious minion, with a chuckle of satisfaction; " it will give us our revenge, and at the same time supply us with the needful. I have a good many scores to settle with the people about here; and I know of the farm of a certain rebel that I shall ask for my share, as I think I justly may, seeing how active I've been this summer. "Yes, yes," replied Peters, rather impatiently; " but there must be no more wavering and turning with you. What you ask you must earn, remember." "You see if I don't! only name what you would have me do, colonel!" eagerly responded the other. "' Well, I will now," said the former, coming to a halt. "Yes, as we are, by this time, fairly out of reach and hearing of there  foiled rebels, who have so kindly yielded me a pass through this side of their watch, thinking, doubtless, that I could not have been , in the house when they surrounded it, but should be there this  evening--yes, I will give you my orders now, which will era- 'brace a fresh item or two above what I intended before someof i the occurrences of this afternoon, ' Well, in the first place, you    4          THE RANGERS,   , are to proceed to Castleton, and join the northern company there collected and ready for Operations at the Remington rendezvous. on will then become the guide and assistant of the leader of that force, which is to move on to some secret and safe place, to be selected by you. (as you know the localities, and the leader oant) in the woods near the Twenty Mile En ampment, where, acting as the advanced corps of our planned expedition to the Connecticut by that route, they will remain concealed as much as possible, till further orders, watching all movements of the rebels, and draw ing in every trusty loyalist that can be ap- proached. And mark We, Redding, while there, or elsewhere, remember, that accursed Woodburn is a doon:,ed man, and is to be taken, if found, and kept for my disposal. And I have anoth. er order, which must be left still more to your especial manage- ment. Haviland's daughter, with whom- you know, I suppose, h ow I am situate, has got some dangerous notions into her head, a: ad, refusing to Iear to her father, who wishes her to go with him to the army, has determined to go to her :relatives, Over the a iountain, in a carriage the rebels have promised to provide her. She will be along that road, probably, soon after you get to y ur rendezvous. She must be stopped, an( conducted, with good treatment, mind you, back, through some secret route, to fie British camp, where her father, though he knows nothing ot' my plan, will be glad to receive and keep her. And now I will be off to my horse, which I luckily left at the house of a friend, on the crows road, about a mile to the we.st of us." ' 'Will you go far on your journey to-night ? ' "About seven miles, to the house of another friend, where I amn to be joined by the squire in the morning, and, with him, proceed directly(t 3 the army." f" How soon are we to hear from you ? " "Within ten d ays, or sooner. I shall, wit all possible de- S atch, organize and prepare the force designed for the purpose; w hen I shall sweep on through Arlington and Manchester, and, after teaching them a few lessons in that quarter, proceed at once to join you. There ! you now know all; go, and remember that secrecy and vengeance are tile watchwords." ." Ay, ay; I am your man for all that, colonel," responded the heartless tool, as the two now separated to depart on their differ- ent destinations.   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.        65 CHAPTER V. 'c What nearer foe is lurking in the glade? - But joy! Columbia's friends are ,trampling through the shade!" ONE of the earliest and most noted of the houses of public entertainment in Vermont was that of Captain John Coffin, situated in the north part of Cavendish, on the old milit/ary road, cut out, in the French wars, by the energetic General Amherst, with a regiment of New Hampshire Boys, and extending from Number Four, as Charleston on the Connecticut was then called, to the fortresses on Lake Champlain. This tavern, at the time of the revolution, being on the very outskirts of the settlements on the east side of the Green Mountains, was long the general resort of the soldier and the common wayfarer for rest and refreshment, before and after passing over the long and dreary route of moun- tain wilderness lying between the eastern and western settlements of the state. And to the soldier, especially, it was a favorite haven; the more so, doubtless, from the congenial character of its frank, fearless, patriotic, but blunt and unpolished landlord, whose substantial cheer and hearty welcome, money or no money, usually caused him to be looked upon as a friend, as well as a good entertainer. To this then widely-known establishment we will now repair, to note the occurrences next to be related in the progress of our story. On a dark and cloudy afternoon, about ten days after the events related in the last chapter, a company of five persons were as- sembled in the rudely finished bar-room of the inn just described. Of these, three were strangers, or pretended strangers, to the house and each other; having dropped in at different intervals -during the afternoon. Of the two others, one was the landlord, whose burly frame, rough, open features, and fear-nought coun- tenance need have left none in doubt of either the physical -or moral traits which experience proved he possessed. The others a somewhat tall, thin, gaunt man, of a weather-beaten visage, and a sort of sly, scrutinizing look, was an old acquaintance of the reader. As of old, his large powder-horn and ball-pouch were slung under his left arm, and his long, heavy rifle, standing by 6         -   byt         THE RANGERS, -. his side, was resting on the sill of the open window, beneath which he had seated himself, so as to enable him to note what aight be passing without as well as within. The manner in which the latter and the landlord occasionally exchanged glances, Implied a previous and familiar acquaintance, the usual manifes- tations of which seemed to be .repressed by tLe presence of the three guests first named, who were evidently objects of the secret suspicion of the former. But, all this, for some time, might have passed unheeded by any but close observers; for few remarks, and those of the briefest .and most common-place kind, were offered; and an inclination for silence and reserve was manifest among the company. A circumstance at length occurred, however, which quickly awakened the landlord from his apparent apathy, and brought home of the leading characteristics of the man at once into view. b very large and powerfully-made black dog, which belonged to j the house, had just marched into the room,and laid down to sleep in the middle of the floor; when one of the strangers, whom we have noticed, in returning from the bar, where he had been for a drink of water, trod on the animal's tail, either through ' accident or design - probably the latter; at least the landlord seemed to suspect so; for his countenance ins antly flashed with. indignation, and, turning abruptly to the aggressor, he said,-  "What was that done for, sir?" "Done for?" replied the other, indifferentlyr. '/ Why, it was done because the dog was in my way. If he don't want his tail rod on, he- must keep out from under foot; that's all." "Well, sir," rejoined the former, in no gentle tones, "I don't r now who you are; but whether whig or tory, gentle or simple, I shall just take the liberty to tell you, that if I was sure you did that intentionally, I would pull your ears for you; for, if any living being has a good right to remain undisturbed, and do as he likes in this house, it is that dog. Roarer, come here, my old friend," he added, turning to fondle the creature, that now, drop- ping the menacing attitude he had assumed towards the aggressing stranger, came up and thrust his huge snout into his master's lap. ' Yes, old fellow, while I live, you shall never want a friend to avenge your wrongs, though I have to fight a regiment to do it! And aint I right in that,I Dunning?" he still further remarked, turning to the hunter. "Der yes, if needful," replied the latter; " but the ditter dog, I'm thinking, would ask no favors, if you would give him leave o der do his ovn work on meddlers." i   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.      $67 "O, that wouldn't do, you know, Tom," rejoined the former; ":for, if I but said the word, Roarer would tear him in shoe- strings, as quick as you could say Jack Roberson! No; I'll set-  tle the hash myself. And I am now ready to hear the fellow's explanation," he added, again turning sternly to the aggressor. But the last-named questionable personage, not relishing the course matters were taking, now, in a subdued and altered tone, promptly disclaimed any intention of touching the'dog, and ex- pressed his regret at what had happened. "O, that's enough," said Coffin, instantly cooling off. "All right now, Roarer. You may lie down again, sir," he continued, waving away the dog, that had faced round, and still stood suspi- ciously eyeing the offender. "Yes, that's enough; we'll call the matter settled. But by way of explaining to you, who are strangers, what I have said about that dog's claims to my friend- ship and protection, I must tell you a story, which will show you how much the noble creature is deserving at my hands. "Six years ago, the seventh day of last March, as I was re- turning from the settlements on Otter Creek, a distance of from twenty to thirty miles, through the then entire wilderness, with the snow nearly five feet deep on a level, and the weather so cold and stormy, that I was compelled to travel with great-coat on, as well as snow-shoes, I undertook to cross one of the ponds in Plymouth on the ice, which I supposed perfectly sound and safe for any thing that could be got on to it. But for some reason or other, there seemed to have been one place, concealed from view by the snow, so thin and spongy, that the moment I stepped upon it, I went down some feet below the surface into the water; while the snow and broken ice at once closed over me. - And although I succeeded in forcing my way up through the slush, and getting my head above water, yet I soon found it, hampered as I was with snow-shoes and great-coat, impossible to get out. As sure as I tried to raise myself by the treacherous support at the sides, so sure was it to give way, and precipitate me back into the water. But still I struggled on, till chilled to the vitals, so benumbed that I could scarcely move a limb, and growing weaker and weaker at every effort, I could do no more ; and I saw myself gradually sinking for the last time. O heavens! who can describe my sensations--who conceive the thousand thoughts -that flashed through my mind at that horrible moment! But just as I was on the point of giving up in despair, I caught a glimpse of my -dog (that had taken a circuit wide from me after some game) coming on to the pond. I raised one faint shout -it was all    68  .        THE RANGERS, could do, - and, though nearly a half mile off, he heard it, and came on, with monstrous bounds, to the spot. In a moment he was there; and, after giving me one look, - I can never forget that look,--he slid down to the very verge of the hole to try to assist me. With a struggle, I made out to raise one hand out of the water within his reach. He seized the cuff of my coat, and, drawing back with the seeming strength of a draught-horse, he, with one pull, brought me half out of the water. With a des- perate effort on my part, and another on his, the next instant I was lying helpless, but safe, on the ice, while the dog fairly howled aloud for joy! I said safe; for as hopeless as some might have viewed my situation, even then, wet, benumbed, nearly dead with cold and exhaustion, and many miles from any human help or habitation, as I was, yet rallying every energy I had left me, and rolling, kicking, and pawing, to put my blood in motion, and regain the use of my limbs, I soon got on to my feet; when, seizing my gun, that I had hurled aside as I went down, I made for a dry tree in sight, fired into a spot of spunk I luckily found on one side of it, kindled a fire, warmed and dried myself, set forward again, and reached home that night; but with feelings towards that dog, sir, that I can never know towards any other created being - not even, in some respects, towards my wife and children. Yes, sir; I will not only fight, but, if need be, die for him." While the captain was relating his oft-told but truthful ad- venture with his justly-prized dog, the quick eye of Dunning caught, through the window, a glimpse of a recognized form, approaching in the road from the east; and slipping out unno- ticed from the room. he beckoned the approaching personage round the corner of the house, and when safely out of the    hearing and observation of those in the bar-room, he turned to the other, and said,-- "Der devil 's in the wind, Captain Harry!" I "How so? Have you discovered the suspected rendezvous?" "6 Der yes; and more too." "Indeed! where is it?" "Ditter deep in the thickets, on the west side of the pond nearest the great road over the mountains." "Ah, ha! but their numbers? any more, probably, than the small club we supposed?" "Der double, and then the ditter double of that, if it don't make more than twenty." "You surprise me, Dunning, Are you sure?" '   ' \!   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.        69 ' Sure as that I am der talking to Captain Woodburn." "Impossible! It must be some secret meeting, of the disaf- fected in this quarter." "Der not that, but a regularly armed force, and, with the ditter exception of two or three about-home tories, may be, all strange faces, including a sprinkling of red skins, brought along with them for ditter decency's sake, I suppose." "But how could such a force get so far into the interior un- detected? How dare they venture on so hazardous a -move- ment? and what can be their designs in so doing?" "Der here is something that ditter tells a rather loud story about that; at least, as to the matter of intentions," said the hunter, by way of reply, taking a crumpled paper 'from his cap and handing it to the other. Woodburn took the paper, and eagerly ran over its contents; which to his astonishment he found to be a copy of an order from General Burgoyne to Colonel Peters, detailing the plan of an expedition, to be conducted by the latter, with one hundred loyal- ists and a company of Indians, by way of the head waters of Otter Creek, across the mountains to Connecticut River, where this force was to be joined by the loyal troops from Rhode Island, and directing him I' to scour the ;country, levy contribu- tions, take hostages, make prisoners of all civil and military officers acting under Congress, collect horses, and, after pro- ceeding down the river as far as Brattleborough, return to the great road to Albany."  "How did this get into your hands, Dunning?" demanded the surprised and excited officer, as soon as he had mastered the contents. i "IDer well, having crept along near the edge of the pond within ten or twelve rods of their camp, I was lying in the bushes for discoveries; when ditter one of 'em - their leader, I suppose -came down to the pone, for observation, likely; and, while * The document here quoted was brought to General Stark on his advance through Vermont; and there can be but little doubt of its genuineness; as it afterwards came out, in the) trial of Burgoyne, in Sthe British Parliament, that such an expedition was actually started, but subsequently changed for that of Bennington. How considerable a por- tion of the whole intended force penetrated into the interior is not ascer- tained. But we have the authority of the oldes; inhabitants for asserting, that a portion of this force did cross over the! mountains, and some of. them even reached Springfield.; when, owing ho the unexpected move- ments they found going on among the people, and the rumored advance of Stark, all, who were not taken, speedily dec ed.   70          THE RANGERS, peering up and down the shore, a gust of wind blew his hat off into the water. But though he regained his ditter hat aind -dis- appeared, I soon saw a piece of wlhite paper blowing along in the water towards me. After a whiles it reached the sort of point where I was, and lodging against a bbsh, I secured it, and found it this same thing. What do you think of it, captain?" "Why, it unfolds a plan too bold for credence." "Not too bold for may ditter credence, captain." "Then you think it no feint?" "Der no, sir, but a regular bred expedition, which they mean to push as soon as more force arrives. I have been ditter watching things a little since I got at this wrinkle. They have spies out in every direction. 'Tis not an hour since I espied a' fellow peering from the corner of the woods up yonder, who, I think, must be that treacherous ditter devil, David Redding; and there are three now in the bar-room of the same kidney." "Ah! well, all this may be. Such an expedition may have been set afoot at the instigation of such fellows as Spencer, who, having left the Council of Safety before any thing was done, and while its distracted counsels seemed to preclude all prospect that any thing would be done for the defence of the state. Ay, that is it; and little dreaming of what has since transpired, Peters, who is probably behind, with the main force, has sent forward this as a sort of pioneer corps, who, coming over a route now mostly deserted by our people, have penetrated here nearly to the Twenty Mile Encampment, without once suspecting what is going on through the rest of the state. But that is a secret, which, thanks to the prompt patriotism shown by our young men in en- listing, we shall now soon be able to teach them; for my com- pany is already nearly full ; and, if you have notified- the recruits you enlisted, Sergeant Dunning, they will all be here for mustering by to-morrow night." L All done, as in der duty bound, captain; and six of my men said they would be here this evening." "Indeed! there will be almost enough of us, if your six recruits all get in, to make a pounce upon this nest of vipers to-night. Let's see ; six -you, myself, and Captain Coffin, and "And der Bart, if he comes; ditter don't you expect him along here to-night?" "I do.

"Unless," said Dunning, guessing the thoughts of the other, and taking up the supposition - 4" unless beset by some of this prew, who are ordered to take prisoners and hostages. But der stay; didn't I catch the glimmer of a distant horseman then?" he continued, pointing along the partially wooded road to the west. "There! that was a clearer view; and, by the ditter darting kind of gait of the horse, I should think it might be Lightfoot, and the short rider the critter we've been talking about."                    i The hunter's eye had not misled him; for in a few minutes :he horseman emerged from the forest into open view, and con- Iprmed the conjecture that had just been made respecting his identity. As he neared the house, perceiving Woodburn and Dunning beckoning to him from behind the buildings, he threw himself from his saddle, leaped over the fence, and approached them. "The news, sir? What is it? Speak!" eagerly exclaimed Woodburn, as Bart, with a downcast and troubled look, drew near. "Bad as need to be, consarn it!" replied the latter, with an air of mingled vexation and self-reproach. "But I couldn't help it." "Help what? What has happened? Where is the lady?" rapidly asked the alarmed and impatient lover. "Taken prisoner by the tories, as I guessed 'em. She and Vine Howard, that come with her, and the boy that drove 'em." "How? when? where?" "Why, as we were coming down this side the mountain, and when nearly to the bottom, five or six fellows, with guns, rushed out of the bush, seized the horse, pulled out the women, and hurried them off with two of their number into the woods to- wards the pond; while the rest made a push to take me, who was riding just behind. But firing a pistol in their faces, and giving Lightfoot my stiffest sign, we dashed through or over them, and escaped, with their bullets whistling after us, one after another, till we were out of reach." "These ladies shall be rescued before I sleep, or I will perish in the attempt," said Woodburn, with stern emphasis. "Let us arm and set forward immediately with the best force we can raise."   Ti'. LHil KANGERES, . ) "There is a thing or two to be ditter done first, it strikes me," observed Dunning, with his usual coolness; " that is, if we don't want enemies both before and behind us, on the way." "What is that, Dunning?"  "Secure those three chaps-in the bar-room, or they'll be ditter  sure either to be on our heels, or get there before us to raise the alarm, of our coming."   '; Are they armed, think you?" "With ditter knives only, I'm thinking -their guns may have been left in the point of woods yonder, in charge of the spy I named, who, now I ditter think on't, ought to be taken about the same time, for fear of some secret signal being given." The suggestions of Dunning, who, as the reader will already  : have inferred, had been made a sergeant in Woodburn's company of Rangers, were at once approved by his superior, who accord-, ingly,. as the first step, despatched him and Bart to the woods, where the man conjectured to be in charge of the arms of his comrades was supposed to be concealed. After waiting till the two others might have had time to gain the woods in question, Woodburn left his stand, anld, passing round to the front of the 5 house, baldly marched into the bar-room, where the three sus- pected personages still sat listeninagto the stories with which the landlord, who suspected what was in progress, seemed intent on amusing them. They, however, now seemed suddenly to lose all interest in the recital going on, and, after exchanging uneasy E and significant glances, simultaneously rose to depart. "You are my prisoners, gentlemen," said Woodburn, stepping before them and presenting a cocked pistol. For a moment, the surprised tories stood mute in alarm and doubt, alternately glancing from their armed opptonent to the landlord, and, from the latter to the door and windows, as if weighing the chances and means of escape. But, the next instant, two of them suddenly turned, and drawing and flourishing their knives' behind them, sprang for the open windows, with the inten- tion of leaping through them. "At 'em, Roarer!" exclaimed Coffin, seizing one escaping tory by the leg, and hurling him back with stunning effect upon. the floor. The dog was but little behind his master in drawing back, by i grip in his clothes, the other to the floor, where he was. glad to liev without offering further resistance' to the grim and growling conqueror'standing. over him, The third, in the mean while, not' daring to stir lest a worse fate should befall him, standing as he I R   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER. \      7$ was directly before the muzzle of Woodburn's pistol, and seeing the situation of his comrades, immediately submitted; when -al-l, giving up their concealed arms, now quietly yielded themselves , as prisoners. In a few minutes after the surrender of the tories, their guns: were brought in by Dunning and Bart, who found them at the: suspected place, though the-traitor, Redding, whom they identified, had just taken the alarm, and was seen retreating over a distant knoll as they came up to the spot. The prisoners being left in charge of the landlord's oldest boy, who was armed for the purpose, and the dog-Roarer, the rest of the, company now retired to another part of the house, to devise measures for the rescue of the fair captives, for which a prelim- inary step only had as yet been taken. Having at length fixed on the plan of operations which they believed most promising of auspi. cious results, they immediately commenced their hasty prepara- tions for the bold adventure. And Dunning's six recruits luckily arriving in season, the whole company, now consisting of ten resolute woodsmen, and led on by a man fully resolved to succeed or perish, set forward, a little after sunset, for the scene of action, which was several miles distant from the tavern. According to the plan that had been adopted, two men were to proceed to the eastern shore of the pond, take a log canoe, and, under cover of the darkness, row silently over to some point beyond, but near the tory encampment; and, after making what discoveries they could respecting the situation of the captives, lie in ambush and await the operations of the rest of the company, who were to pro- ceed round by the road, enter the woods, and gain a post on the other side of the encampment, and, by a feigned attack, draw off the tories, and thus afford the former a favorable moment to rush from their concealment and release the captives. And if they found this impracticable, they were then to shout aloud the watchword, To the rescue! when both parties of the assailants were to make an earnest and desperate onset on the foe. Dun- ning and Bart, from their known sagacity and skill as woodsmen, and coolness and intrepidity in action, were the two men selected to undertake- the more difficult and hazardous part first men- tioned. After a rapid and silent march of about an hour, the company reached the vicinity of the pond, just as the last suffusions of an obscured twilight disappeared in the west, and halted a few min- utes, that the different parts of the plan might be repeated and clearly understood by all before separating. 7   .        .            J   j  74        THE RANGERS, "Remember the arrangement, boys," said Woodburn, address- ing Dunning and Bart, in a voice which betrayed the intense soli. citude he felt in the event at issue. "Recollect the first and main object is to release and get off the ladies, and if this can be done within the hour we will give you for the purpose, as it possibly may be, before we make any demonstrations in front, so much the better; if not, proceed in the manner agreed on. And may Heaven favor the innocent, whose cause, remember, is mostly in your hands." With this the company separated, and each party proceeded to their different destinations. We will follow the itwo intrusted with the most difficult part of the enterprise.   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       75 CHAPTER   VI. -j -  "The first that hears Shall be the first to bleed." THE hunter, followed by his young comrade, now leaving the rest of the band to proceed to their contemplated stand by the main road, struck off into the woods to the right, and, with silent :and rapid steps, led the way to the south-eastern shore of the pond. Here finding, as he seemed to have expected, a capacious canoe, dug out from the trunk of some huge pine, he drew it forth \ is  from its concealment, beneath a mass of fallen trees projecting over the bank, and, bidding Bart enter with the oars, and placing one knee on the stern, with a grasp on the sides, gave a push with his foot from the shore, which sent his rude craft surging out far into the open expanse of water before him. Before applying the oars, however, and while the canoe continued to move under the impulse it had thus received, its occupants employed them- selves in bending their heads to the water, and listening for any sounds that might indicate the presence of others abroad on the !^;p d.  The night, as it was yet moonless, and as the sky was o ov;e'ouded, was consequently a dark one; and the adventurers could distinguish little else but the dark outlines of the Green Mountains, that rose high in the western heavens, casting, by their huge shadows, an impenetrable pall of darkness over the inter- vening space beneath, from which not a sound rose to the ear, save an occasional short croak of some waterfowl, or the low, sullen dash of the waters along the shores. "Nothing out on the pond, guess, but loons, ducks, and sich X   like," quietly observed Bart, raising himself from his listening attitude; " nor can I make, out any sounds from the nest of 'em you say there is over on the shore yonder. Ma'be they've pulled up stakes and are off with their traps, the wimin folks and all- shouldn't wonder, single bit."  "Now I reason a little ditter different," replied the sergeant. "They may be getting oneasy and suspicious, because their spies we took there at Coffin's don't return; and so keep still, and put out their fires, lest the absent ones be dogged back, and their ren- dezvous thus discovered; but I der don't believe the company   76         . THE RANGERS, would clear out till they knew what become of them. They are still there, I'm apt to think ; so we will now put forward - first up north a piece, on this side, and then across and down to a little cove there is near their encampment." So saying, Dunning took up one of the oars, and, with long, vigorous, but noiseless strokes, sent the boat rapidly ahead ; while the other took a position most favorable for a lookout. In this manner, and taking turns at the oar, they soon, by the course they had marked out for themselves, reached the western side of the pond, and, heading round, moved cautiously along the shore towards the hostile encampment. "Ah! there! one- two- yes, three camp fires, I can der catch glimmers of occasionally," softly exclaimed Dunning, rising up in the boat, and peering ahead for observation. "D I was right - the ditter rapscallions are there, snug in their quarters, but had wit enough to build their fires behind logs, or something, so as not to be seen from 'tother side. We are within the ditter matter of three hundred yards of 'em, now; so carefully, Bart, and don't let your oar graze the boat, or any thing, to give out the least sound; for they've ears, it's der probable, as well as we." A short time now sufficed to bring them to the small cove, at which the hunter had proposed to land., Here, under the screen of an impervious tangle of brushwood and fallen tree tops, which intervened between them and the foe, they drew up their boat on to the shore. They then, after taking off their shoes, which they left in the canoe, carefully crawled upi the bank, passed round the thicket, and paused to listen. The! sounds of voices conversing in low tones in one spot, the slow steps of a sentinel in -another, and the snoring of some hard sleeper in a third, were soon detected by the quick ears of the anxious listeners. "As I thought," whispered Dunning, putting his mouth close to the ear of the other: "the head ones are ditter suspicious and watchful; but we must try what can be done - at least to find the spot where they've put the gals. There's a ditter old shanty I used to camp in, about fifty yards ahead; and as that is probably the best they've got, I've been thinking they may have cooped 'em in there. Suppose you, who are lightest and smal-est, creep forward to it, for ditter discoveries. I will follow half way, and wait." Without demurring to the suggestion, Bart immediatelv set for. ward, on his hands and knees, in the direction indicated by his com- panion.. Carefully removing every dry twig and leaf fTom each place where he wished to bear his weight, and moving as noise.   O THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       " lessly as the preying t along the ground, he made his way on- ward till he had gone far enough, as he judged, to reach the expected shanty; when he paused to listen and reconnoitre. But now all seemed nerfectly still. Not the slightestsound of any kind reached his ears; while it had, in some unaccountable man- ner, suddenly become so pitchy dark that he could not distinguish a single object before him. And he began to feel confused and doubtful about proceeding, when, by the action of those secret and undefinable sympathies, perhaps, by which, it is said, we some- times become apprised of the presence of others before we are informed by the senses, he all at once became impressed with the idea that some person was near him. He therefore strained his senses to the utmost in trying to discover what objects might be before or around him; but all, for a while, to no purpose. In a short time, however, his ear caught the sound of a deep sigh, the softness of which told him it came from a female, within a few feet of him. With a palpitating heart, he now doubtfully attempted to move forward, wh3n he suddenly perceived his head on the point of coming iih contact with some broad, high obstacle, which seemed to rise like a wall before him. Surprised, and still more confused than before, he retreated a few paces, and looked up- waird; to try to make 3ut the nature of the obstacle before him; when he discovered it to be the backside of the very shanty of which he was in Isearch. The strange darkness, which had so suddenly overshadowed him, and which was caused by the ob- struction of the skylight by this rude structure, being now ex- plained, and every thing made clear to his mind, he cautiously moved round towards the front of the shanty, to find the entrance, no longer doubting that those he sought were within. On reach. ing the front corner, so as to enable him to peer round it on that side, he soon made out the entrance; but directly across it, to his disappointment, he discovered the half-recumbent form of a man, with a musket leaning on his shoulder. After a few hurried ob-. servations, in which he discovered, by the decaying fires before' them, several other shanties or tents among the trees, a few rods in front, Bart agailn slunk back to the spot he. had just left, and was about to retrace his way to his companion, when a new thought occurred -o him, and, moving up to the back of the shanty, which was formed by broad pieces of thick bark standing slant- ingly against a pole supported by crotches, and, placing his, mouth to a crack, softly whispered the names of the captives, and turned his ear to the spot to catch the hoped-for response. For the first moment, all was still; but the next, the catching of a long-sus-. r X   78          THE RANGERS, pended breath, and even, as-he thought, the rapid beatings of a fluttering bosom, became audible. Presently a slight movement, as of a cautiously changed posture, was heard within; and the next instant a pair of soft lips came in contact with his ear at the crevice, articulating, in sounds scarcely above the slightest mur- mur of the air,- ' Who speaks my name?" "Bart," replied the other. "You know what I'm after. Can one of the barks between us be removed without alarming your keeper?" -"I fear- but he seems asleep -try it," was the measured and hesitating reply. After slightly essaying several of the pieces of the bark he wished to remove, he at length commenced operations at the bottom of one of them, and gently f6rcing it aside, inch by inch, in a short time effected an opening sufficient, as he judged, for the egress of the captives, and that too, he felt confident, without attracting the attention of the dozing guard. "Now feel your way out; and, without stirring a twig or leaf, creep on after me," whispered Bart. X And receding a few paces from the .pening, he paused to await the result. In a moment he had te satisfaction of per. ceiving a female form slowly emerging fr m the narrow passage into the open air without. Supposing her companion to be immediately behind, he now, with a whispered word of encouragement, led the way from the spot. With frequent pauses, both to assure himself that he was followed by his charge, and to listen for any stir among the foe that should indicate a discovery of the escape, he continued to creep forward till he encountered Dunning, when, the latter tak- ing the lead, they all moved on, one after another, in the same cautious manner as before, and soon reached the landing in safety; but as they emerged from the bushes, and the' hunter turned to congratulate the ladies on their escape, it was now, for the first time, discovered that but one of them was present. "Bart, how is this? ditter tell me - where is the other?" de- manded Dunning, in a tone of disappointment and vexation. But Bart, equally disappointed and' perplexed, was mute; and the lady, who proved to be Miss Howard, replied, - "Miss Haviland, if not retaken, is now wandering in the woods." "4Derlwandering in ditter woods, and you not with her?" again demanded the former, with an air of mingled surprise and reproach.   [I          OR TIIE TORYS DAUGHTER.       79 "Yes, sir, but I did not intend to desert her," promiptly replied the girl. '"Perceiving we were not watched very closelyby the man they put over us, she and I had thought of a plan of escaping into the woods and getting round into the road. Arid while he was talking with another, that he had stepped forward a little ways to meet, we slipped out undiscovered, and gained a thicket; when finding I had left my shawl, I, contrary to Miss Haviland's advice, i  I will own, ventured back to get it, and was detected, just as I was leaving the shanty a second time, and her absence discovered. This made a stir among them, and they ordered off scouts after her along the pond towards the road, which was the way I pointed when they were threatening me if I didn't tell. But she must have heard all and escaped." :ia "Escaped! ditter deuse of an escape that; for a woman to get out into a forest full of Indians in search of her," replied the = , still unreconciled hunter. 44 But what course has she der taken, think ye, gal?" "The one we planned, likely; and that was, to take a wide sweep round their camp, gain the. road, and, make for the tavern, which she said was not far off," replied the other. "Well," said Dunning, in a more mollified tone, " though der' dogs is in the luck, to be sure, yet half a loaf is better than none. We must save what we have got; so into the canoe there with ye, gal; and you, Bart, take her across, der find Harry, whom I'd ditter rather you would meet first, and tell him you have left me this side to go in search of the other, who, if found, can most likely be got to the road as well the way she set out as this, in the shape things now stand." 'Although this conversation scarcely occupied a minute, and although, while the hunter was yet speaking, Bart and his fair friend were in their-respective positions in the boat, which instantly shot out silently and swiftly into the pond, under the vigorous push given it by the former, yet the event showed that they had been none too speedy in their movements; for, at that instant, a sud- den bustle in the tory encampment, which was quickly followed' by the confused sounds of voices making rapid inquiries and giving orders, together with the stealthy tread of approaching footsteps, apprised the fugitives that not only was their escape discovered, but probably also the direction they had-taken. "1 Der narve it, narve it, Bart! The ditter divils are after ye!" shouted the hunter, hastily retreating from the shore, and disap- pearing in the nearest thicket. And scarcely had he gained a covert, before his place was   occupied by four or five of the enemy, who came rushing down to the water; when, discovering the receding boat, then not fifty yards distant, the acting leader of the band fiercely exclaimrned, "Put about 'there instantly, and come ashore, or we'll fire and kill every person in the boat!"  "O, but you'll kill us if we come back," replied Bart, splash- ing round his oar as if turning the boat, which in fact was going swiftly ahead. "No, we won't," responded the leader, deceived by the apparent simplicity of the reply; " but be quick, or we fire!" "Well, seeing you aint going to hurt us," said the former, carelessly, while at the same time directing, in a whisper, the girl lo throw herself close on the bottom of the canoe, he silently, but with all his might, bent himself to the oar. '"Why," said the leader, after a short and doubtful pause, as he peered out in the darkness at the dimly-seen boat-" why, aint the fellow still moving ahead? He is, confound him: fire!" n"Let drive, then!" sung out Bart, with the greatest sangfroid, as he hastily cast himself down in the boat. The next instant several bullets struck the boat, or whistled over it, as the fierce flashings and deafening reports of as many exploding muskets burst from the shore with startling effect on theo darkness and silence of night. I vown! but that an't so bad shooting as might be, in the dark so," exclaimed Bart, hastily spring;ng up and seizing his oar. "They are more at the business than I thought 'em; and we may as well be a little further off afore they have time to load and fire agin, guess," he added, suddenly changing the direction of the boat from the course it had been taking, and plying the oar with an energy which showed rather less indifference to his proximity to the hostile marksmen behind him than his words might seem to imply. The tories, in the mean while, who had foolishy all discharged their pieces at once, fell to loading again as fast as was possible for them to do in the dark. But before any of them was ready to firel the last traces of the fugitive boat had vanished from their view. They were, however, -after giving vent to their vexation in a volley of curses upon the fellow who had thus outwitted them, in getting beyond controlling distance, preparing to fire again, at random, in the direction in which the canoe was last seen moving, when their attention was suddenly arrested by firing in the woods, a short distance to the south, which seemed to be an exchange of '      * , I   shots between their pickets and some enemy assailing them from that direction. They therefore hurried back to their companions, and with them rallied to make a stand against the force which all supposed was about to storm their encampment. But to their agreeable disappointment, though an occasional shot continued to be directed towards them by persons who seemed to be lurking in the distant thickets, no tangible force made its appearance; for the ftring which had so alarmed them, and caused them to call in all their scouts within hearing, and make every preparation for a desperate resistance, was, as the reader will have already imagined, but the feint made by Woodburn's party, who, hearing the report , of the guns discharged at the escaping canoe, and partly divi ing the cause, had advanced from their concealment, and begun to make the diversion agreed on at the outset.! But not receivi ng the signal promised, in case help was needed, and feeling doibtful how to act, most of them fell back, and ceased operations, till Bart, who had, in the mean time, reached the shore, and, with the fearless girl he had released, hastened round to their posit, arrived and informed them of all that had occurred. On receiving this aggravating intelligence, Woodburn, now al- most frantic with disappointment and anxiety, instantly withdrew to the road with all his band, except two left to keep the enemy in a state of alarm; when they all, including even the heroic Vine Howard, immediately scattered in different directions through the dark fcrest in anxious search for the luckless Miss Haviland, to whom Mwe will now return, for the purpose of following her in the wild and perilous adventures she was destined to encounter. on that eventful night. i'     i      *     ' 'i   '  I  I    '        *   l \ CHAPTER. VII. "Unshrinking from the storm, Well have ye borne your part, With woman's fragile form, But more thanl manhood's heart."--Wieir. t THE observation is no less true than trite, that no one knows, till he has tried it, what he can do or endure. And as just as is the remark in a general ap lication, it is, we apprehend, more strikingly so when applied o the gentler sex; for, from the position they occupy in socia life, their powers of action or en. durance are so seldom fully put to the test, that they are generally far less conscious than men of what deeds they might accomplish or what degree of suffering they might endure, in emergencies calculated to call forth the hi hest energies of their physical and moral natures.  And if there e any disparity between the number of heroes and heroines in the- orld, such emergencies as we haye named are only wanting, we )elieve, to make up any deficiency that may be found in the latte r. When   Miss Haviland asc ertained that her too venturous companion  had been interceated and retaken, in the manner mentioned in the preceding  hapter, she for a moment greatly hesitated whether to return an yield herself again to her captors, or persevere in her attempt to escape. But, beginning to suspect the true source of the present isfortune, which, if her suspicions were just, pointed only at herself, and thinking that her escape would soon lead to the volunttry release of her companion, she i quickly decided on the latter alternative, and glided noiselessly away into the depths of the fol est. After proceeding in a direci course from the camp to such a distance as should preclude "he possibility that any ordinary sound made in walking through the woods would reach her cap- tors, unless they were in actua pursuit behind, of which her often strained senses had as vet give I her no evidence, she turned short to the south, and, in pursuance of the hasty plan formed by her- self and companion at the outset, now made her way, as fast as the darkness and the usual obs acles of the woods would permit, towards the road, her only guid9 being the parallel swells of land, which, running north and south, rose, as she had luckily noticed   OR THE TORKYS DAUGHTERIS.       oo before dark, in successive lifts up the mountain to the west. Still hearing no sounds of pursuit, she began to entertain stfong hopes that she should be permitted to reach the road unmolested. In this, however, she was doomed to be disappointed; for, in a short time, a cracking, as of dry ;twigs under the .tread of some one stealthily advancing, arrested her attention, and brought her to a stand. Fortunately, no part of her dress was sufficiently light-colored to betray her. And, having nothing to fear from this, and believing that, by placing herself in close contact with some na tural object, she might ,1till have a good chance to be passed undetected, she glided to the nearest tree, and, placing her back to the side opposite to the suspected foe, awaited his approach in breathless silence. Presently he came up, and, after pausing a moment within a few yards of her, apparently to listen and reconnoitre, he pased by so near as to. graze the bark of the tree behind which she stood, and moved care- lessly on some distance before again pausing to repeat his re- connoissance. She drew a long breath; but, before she dared move from her stand, the sounds o0 other approaching feet reached her ears. And soon two more me n, evidently on the same search, passed by her, at different distances to the east, and, like the first j one, bent their courses northward. After waiting till all sound of their receding steps had wholly died away, she again moved forward, and soon had the satisfaction of finding herself in the road, but a short distance from the spot where, a few hours before, she and her attendant had been captured. It remained now to get beyond the tory encarapment. Could she be permit. ted to pass down the mountain, i i the road, but a half mile, she might then consider the danger Xmostly over, and proceed on to the tavern in comparative safety. And, though aware that this portion of the way might be scarcely less dangerous than any she had passed over, yet, tempted by the facility with which it could be accomplished in the road, she resolved to make the attempt, anc accordingly, with a guarded but rapid step, began to move do n the sloping way before her. But she had proceeded but a short distance, when she was startled by the loud report of fire- aris in the direction of the tory encampment, which, as already described, were, just at that moment, being discharged at the esc aping canoe. While pausing in doubt at the meaning of this unexpected outhreak, the randora firing of Woodburn's party, whch we noted as soon followilg that of the tories, now burst fron the fore t a little before her on the left, and greatly in- cre tsed her perplexity. Sudde ly conceiving the idea, from            *  1 l.   4           THE RANGERS, these circumstances, that the tories had been assailed: in their re ar,and were now retreating towards- her, and this, notion being the next moment confirmed by the glimpses she caught of a dark form emerging from the bushes on the left, whom she mistook for a foe, she hastily turned:'and fled, in agitation and alarm, into the opposite forest bordering the road on the south, having thus approached within a few rods of the very men who were -in search of her, and thus unconsciously eluded their friendly grasp. Though, intending soon to turn her course eastward, so as to, come out again into the road at such a point as should place her beyond any danger of a recapture, yet, urged by her fears, lest her foes should cross the road and overtake her, she pressed on so far into the depths of the woods, that when she paused to change her course, she became confused and doubtfull respecting the direction she should take to regain the road in the manner she had. proposed. She had now no further knowledge of the make of the land, or the situation of the hills, by which she could be guided. But at length, fixing on a course which she thought most likely to be the right one, she again set forward, slowly picking her way through the swampy and tangled tract of forest into which she seemed now to have entered. In this manner she pursued her dubious course onward nearly an hour, every mo- ment expecting that the next would bring her out into the road. At length she fell in with a small stream, which she rightly judged to be one of the brooks running into Black River, and: which, from what she knew of the course of that river, she sup- posed. would lead nearly in the direction she sought to go. But on stooping down to feel the current, she, to her great surprise, found: it. running in a course directly opposite from what she- expected. Scarcely knowing now which way to direct her steps, she passed over the stream, and, with a sense of desolation, growing out of the thought that she was lost in the depths of the wilderness, which she had never before experienced, wandered: on, and on, for several of the successive hours of that dark and dismal night. At last she came to the top of a high swell, where, the new aspect presented in the slope of the forest before her naturally causing her to pause, she dropped down upon an old mossy log to rest her worn and wearied frame, and try to collect her confused and scattered faculties. While here en. deavoring to rally her sinking spirits, and compose her thoughts:. soqas to look more coolly on her situation, she began to discern, through the openings: of the foliage, the dark outlines of a high mountain, rising, at the distance of two or three miles, directly   ig E    OR THOE T0ASY"DAt1GHTER.  in fi o of heri It now occurree to her that, like other pes n. lost n the woods, of whom she had heard, she might have :bee all t fis time, wandering in a circle, and that the mountain before: her night be the very one she supposed she had left far behiS: her, west of the tory encampment. If this supposition shouldU prov edorrect, the long-sought road must lie somewhere betweeni, her Ln the mountain in view, any a little more perseverance 'inj that dirpection would consequently put an end to those perplexities which were now becoming more painful and dread than any- sense ti ns she had experienced from the pursuit of her enemies. En culiaged by the gleam of hope which this thought imparted to her almost despairing mind, she started up, and again nerved hers lf for the task of meeting the many difficulties which she knew, at the best, yet remained to be overcome. It had, by this iinle, in consequence of a scattering of the clouds, or the' risin of a waning moon, become perceptibly lighter, and, for thie next hour, her progress was. much more direct and easy., By this ime, she came to a spot in the forest which was sufficiently; open to! give her another and fai-er view of the mountain she: had 1een approaching. She looked upon its dark sides a moI ment and the pleasant delusion under which she had been labor-  ing v holly vanished from her mind. She saw it could not be: the dountain she had hoped to find it, nor indeed any she/ had ever seen; and she again gave herself up as lost, perhaps,- irretrievably lost, far away and deep in the dark recesses of a. howling wilderness, from which she might never be extricated. And ret her usial firmness did not wholly forsake her. ^ Is not: your life of more value than many sparrows in the sight of Him who ca:eth for all?" she mentally exclaimed; and she was- calmi d and comforted by the ready affirmative which her faith" respcaded.           v - W Rile casting about her in doubt respecting the next step to-be-; taken, she discovered traces of what was evidently once an- ih;i perfe t rioad, or path, which seemed to extend through a partial- openi g gtowards the mountain. Thinking it might possibly lead to so me human habitation, or at least to some place preferable' to the o en forest for rest and shelter till the return of daylight, she resolved to follow it. As she proceeded on, she began to -detect marks of the Moodman's or hunters axe in the trees, here en-- tirely cup downl and there girdled, or denuded of their- bark/a high s the hand could reach. - These indications of the formear: prese ce of men appeared to grow more frequent as she wentf on; and at lengthi-he came out into a small opening in- the-:foreiist'  rOL. II.  8   86          THE, RANGERS, m the midst of which stood a roughly-constructed log-house, or shanty, with a regularly-formed bark roof still standing. The remains of smaller and less durable shanties were also visible in the, vicinity of the former.*  With a cautious and hesitating step, Miss Haviland drew near to this rude structure, and at once perceived, by the appear- ance of the unguarded loop-hole window, and the open entrance, before which the untrodden wild weeds were growing, that it was untenanted., Approaching still nearer, and peering into the window, she discovered, in one corner of the deserted apartment, a comfortable-looking bed, composed of branches of the hem- lock, which she rightly concluded had been collected and used by hunters, who occasionally made the place their quarters for the night. Immediaiely concluding to avail herself of the ad- vantages which this shelter and primitive couch seemed to promise for obtaining the restjher exhausted system so much needed, she entered, and, throwing herself down on the soft and yielding boughs, soon surrendered herself to the influence of the grateful repose, and fell asleeip. She was soon, however, awakened- by what she knew not, unless by the feeling of uneasiness and apprehension, by which she now found herself unaccountably agitated. She had heard, or read, of those mysterious intimations, by which, it is said, We sometimes instinctively become apprised of impending danger, when there is no apparent cause for ap- prehension, and when reason utters no warning. If such in- stances ever in reality occurred, this might be one of them; or the impression might have been unconsciously received from actual sounds, which came from foes now secretly lurking near, and which, as it is known often to be lthe case, had fallen on her slumbering ear, and disturbed and troubled, without fully awak- ening her. But whatever the cause of the strange foreboding, the effect soon became too strong and exciting to permit her longer to remain passive. And she arose to examine the apart- ment, and see what precautions could be taken to render it more safe against the intrusion of enemies, whether they should come in the shape of men or wild beasts. On approaching the en- trance, she discovered, standing by the side of it against the wall, * Colonel Hawks, while traversing the wilderness of Vermont, in the French wars, with a regular force, among whom was the then Captain John Stalk, once encamped near the foot of the mountain, in the south part of Cavendish, where the incident we are narrating is supposed to have oc- curred.- The mountain still bears the name of Hawks's Mountain, and the- traces of the encampment, it is said, are still visible. +   ? 8    - OR THE TORY S DAUGHTER,  a sl rt of rough door made of long cuts of thick barki confined by withes to two cross-pieces, and intended, evidently, as- there we e no contrivances for hanging it, to be set up against the. en tance on the inside as a barrier against the cold, or-the un-  we coqne intrusion of any thing from without. But it had become so water-soaked and heavy, and the end on which it stood:so firmly set in the ground, that she found, on making the attempt, her strength unequal to the task of removing it. And she turned away to look for other means of protecting herself from danger. Casting her eyes upward, she perceived, lying loose on the beams, or rather poles, extending across the room above, several long pieces of bark, which had been left there, probably, when the roof, of the dame material, was constructed. And it immedi? ately occurred to her, that, if she could mount this loft, she might so dis-)ose of .herself there as to escape the observation of any I human intruders, and, at the same time, be out of reach of- any J wild beasts that should enter the room below. Accordingly, going to one corner, She began to mount by stepping on the pro- jecting sides of the logs in the two converging walls, and soon succeeded in reaching the loft, and forming, from the bark, a piece of flooring sufficiently strong and broad to bear her weight and screen her person from observation. Upon this she extended herself, face downwards, with her eyes placed to a small aperture, to enable her to see what might happen in the ;room below, and silently, but with highly excited expectation, a\waited the event. But what event did she expect? She could not tell; and yet she was wholly unable -to divest herself of the continually in- truding idea that something fearful was about to occur; and impel ed by the singular apprehension, she could not help listen- ing for sounds which might herald the approaching evil. For some time, however, no sounds reached her ears, except those low, mingled murmJrs which are peculiar to the forest in the stillness of night. But at length her quickened organs were greeted by some noise which she knew was not a fancied one:; and the next momerLt the sound of human footsteps became dis-. tinctly audible. Presently she heard voices at the door, and then saw two darkfforms cautiously entering the room below. After walking around the apartment and thrusting the muzzles of their guns into corners, with the apparent purpose of ascertaining whether -any one was concealed within, they approached the pile of boughs before described, and gave vent to their satisfaction at finding so good a bed, in a slort, guttural ugh! which proclairmed them, to the trembling listener above, to be Indians, and of those,   -daoubtIess, Whohad been sent out i pursuit of her. They then proceeded to draw up the old door and barricade the entrance after whic they set their guns against the wall, and amped down on th bed in the corner. It would be difficult to describehe sensations with w ich the hapless girl witnessed what had ocurred; and these - it the fear of what might still be in store for her, nearly fillled the measure of her distress and perpl xity; for although s he had thus far escaped observation, and although she soon had the satisfaction of knowing, by the heavy and measured breathing which reachted her ears, that her foe had sunk into a dee sleep yet ,how was she, even now, to avoi falling into their m rciless hands? Should she attempt to descend and escape throgh thes window, could she effect her purp se without being head and detected?  She feared not. And should she remain n her present situation till daylight, woul her terrible visitos then i awaken and depart without discovering her?  This alternative appeared tol her even less promising than the other. Ad yet one of the two courses must be adopted. Which shout be  While anxiously reflecting on the subject, fresh nises in the woods arrestedaher attention. These were also the sounds of footsteps, but evidently not those of any human prowler. With a  light, quick pat, pat, pat, the animal Came up to the door,. paused, and snuffed the air through the crevices. He then moved along to the window, reare himself on his hind legs, thrust in hi nose, and after giving two or three quick, eager snuffs there also, withdrew, and trotted off, at a moderate pace, a-short distance into the forest, wherebhe appeared to come to a sudden halt. IThe next moment, the long, unearthly how of a wolf rose shrill and tremulous from th spot, and died slowly away, in strange, wild cadences, among the echoing mountains a! ound Y  Sabrey insti ctively shuddered at the fearful sound, but instantly turned her attention to the sleeping Indians, whom she exected to hear rousing up and rushing out with their guns after the in. t sidious prowler. But they, to her surprise, snored on, u con- sciousof the danger. The howl was soon repeated, when hort faint responses, in the same shrill, savage modulations, became audible in every direction in the surrounding forest. Thest an. swering cries, growing more distinct and loud every moment, in their evident approach to the spot where!the first signal howl was given, now fully apprised the agitated listener of the farfil w character of the scene which was likely soon to occur be eath or around her. In an incredibly short space of time, the gather.   ing troop of famish ed monsters seemed to bep arriving an d ar- ranging themselves Lder their invoking leader, to -be led on, to the promised prey. And soon the trampling of multitudinous feet evinced that they were in motion and cautiously advancing towards the house. The next moment, they all appeared to have assembled under the window, and paused, as if to plan the mode of attack. After a brief interval, in which no sounds could be distinguished but the low, suppressed snuffing of the troop for the scented prey, a arge wolf leaped up into the narrow aperture, paused a second, an I then quickly thrusting his balanced body for-, ward, dropped noisel ssly down on the ground floor within. Another, and another, and another, followed in rapid succession, till more i than half a score ox the gaunt, grim monsters had landed inside, and silently arrange themselves in a row before the bed of their intended victims, w lo still strangely slept on. One more fearful pause succeeded, in which the greedy band seemed to be eagerly eyeing the fated sleepers, and marking out portions of their bodies for the deadly gripe; when suddenly springing forward, they all fiercely pounced upon the victims, and, with the seeming noise- of a thousand wrangling fiends, mingled with the sharp, short, half-stifled screeches of human agony, that were heard in the hideous din, seized, throttled, and tore them, limb from limb, Ito piees, and bore off the dissevered parts, munching and snarling, to different corners of the room. The noise now for a short time subsided, and nothing was heard but the low, broken growls of the cannibal troop, as they busily craunched the bones, and tore the flesh on which they were making their horrid feast. Then followed the fierce and noisy encounters for the decreasing \ fragments, till none were left worth contending for. At this juncture, two of the half-glutted but still ravenous gang, relinquishing the well-picked bones on which they had been laboring, rose, and, advancing into the middle of the room, stood a moment listlessly viewing the operations of the rest; when they suddenly started, and, turning slowly round and round, began busily to snuff the air, and throw their noses upward in search  of some fresh game that appeared now to have struck their keen 'olfactories. The affrighted maiden, who had been witnessing this hideous scene from her hitherto unsuspected concealment above, with blood curdling in horror at the sights and sounds that reached her recoiling senses, now shuddered in fresh alarm ; fdr she but too well understood what this new and fearfully-signifiCant movement of the wolves portended. And, instinctively with- drawing her face from her loophole of observation, she hastily 8*   idrew herself up in the middle of her- frail support, so ,s to be as faw as possible out of the reach of her expected assail nts. But they at once detected the slight sounds occasioned by her move- ment, and, now iguided by two senses instead of one, instantly "began to gnash their teeth, and, with wild howls, to le p upward after their newly-discovered prey. And although her position -was more than seven feet from the ground,-- a height which, it might be supposed, could not have been re ched by this class of an- imals in a perpendicular leap,--yet so d sperate had the present gang become by the taste of human bloo , that they soon, in their determined and constantly-repeated efforts, began to strike and seize the beams withtheir teeth, by whichi they would hang sus. pended a moment, and then drop back arain to tie ground for another trial. The terrified maiden now save herself p as lost, and tried to quell the tumult of her frenzied feelings! that she might meet her approaching fate, as dreadful as it Was, with calmness and resignation. But the terrific noise of her maddened assailants, as they leaped up, snapping, snarling, and h wling, in demoniac chorus, and made nearer and nearer approac hes every moment to her person, once more aroused her natural instinct for self-preservation; and she arose, and, standing upon her feet, involuntarily bent over one end of her support to catIh a view of what was passing below. In- withdrawing her shrinking gaze from the fiercely upheaving heads and firy eyeballs which there greeted her, she espied the guns of the Indians still standing against the wall, almost directly beneath her, with the muzzles extending upward within the reach of her arm.  With the rapid process of thought which !anger is known often to beget, a new plan of deliverance, suggested by the discovery just made, was instantly formed and digrested in her mind.  And in its pursuance, she drew a white handkerchief from her pocket, and, hastily folding it together, threw it down to the farthest corner of the room below. As she had an'icipated the whole gang rushed after it. And instantly seizing t e oppor. tunity thus afforded to execute her design, she hastily balanced herself on the 'edge of the bark- the most nearly over t ie guns, reached down ,her arm, grasped one of the muzzles, a ad drew - urap the heavy weapon; just in time to escape the baffled lbrutes as they came bounding back, with redoubled' howls: of rage and dis.

With the last sounds of the retreating steps of the:wolves, and with the relief which a returning sense of -safety broughtf to the over-wrought feelings of the maiden, all her strength 'gave way, and, sinking down, weak and helpless as an infant,--:she sobbed out, in the broken murmurs of an overflowing heart, her gratitude to Heaven for her deliverance from the horrid death from which she had so narrowly escaped. For a while she could only tremble and weep; but at length the violence of' her emo- tions began gradually to subside, exhausted nature would -be cheated no longer, and she sunk into slumber, too sound, happily, to permit her to dream over the fearful scenes of the past. When she awoke, it was broad daylight, and all was quiet-within, while without the birds were chanting their morning melodies. At first she could scarcely believe that the scene she had passed through was not the distempered imaginings of some frightful dream. But there, on the blood-stained floor beneath her, lay the carcass of a dead wolf, and the scattered bones of the slain Indians, to attest the dreadful reality. Hastening down from the lofts into the room, and averting her eyes from the revolting spectacle, she hurried forward with a shudder to the door, effected an opening sufficient for her egress, and rushed out into the open air, of which she now drew a long, grateful inhalation, more expressive than words of the deep sense of inward pleasure she experienced in being freed from this den of horrors. Believing that, by the advantages daylight would now afford her, she might be able to retrace her way to the road, she imme- diately sought out and entered the old path by which she had approached the cabin; and this serving to indicate the general course she must pursue to accomplish her purpose, she followed it back to the end, and then passed on through -the forest in the same direction. She had proceeded but a short distance, how- ever, before she was startled by the unexpected appearance of a man advancing through the thick intervening undergrowth directly towards her. As she was about to strike out obliquely into the forest to avoid him, her steps were arrested by his voice callingl out to her. "Don't be alarmed at a friend, young lady," he said, in a plau- sible manner, as he came forward and stopped at a reapectfql   9i2 .

It is Miss Haviland, is it not?" i      i "Yes, sir," replied the latter, looking doubtfully at the man, whom she thought she had somewhere before seen - " yes, that is my name 1 but as there may be both friends and foes out in search of me, you will excuse Ime for saying that I do not know to which of these you belong."

The borders of the stormy deep, The vales where gathered waters sleep,  Sent up the strong and bold." -BryJant.  THE bold and decisive measures of the Council of Safety had by this time begun to manifest themselves in results little antici- pated by the adherents of the royal cause in Vermont . The latter, emboldened both by the presence of a powerfulBritish army on their borders, and the doubts and difficulties which, Afo a while, were known to have embarrassed and rendered ineffectual the deliberations of their opponents, had become so assured and confident of an easy conquest, that in some sections they-prp ceeided openly in the work of enlistment, and in others :pushed forward their parties into the very heart of the interior, before perceiving their error; while, by their representations at head- quarters, they completely deceived Burgoyne and his adviser respecting the true state of feeling that animated the bosoms of the! great mass of the people --a fact made abundantly evident, not only by the subsequent confessions of that general, but by all his operations at the time, and especially that of the short-sighted expedition, which we have before shown him to have planned and set afoot, under Peters, to the Connecticut River. It was no won- der, therefore, that when they now suddenly discovered the whole state in motion - armed men springing up in every glen, nook, and corner of the Green Mountains, and concentrating to join another no less unexpected, and no less formidable force, which was understood to be rapidly advancing from New Hampshire- it was no wonder they were taken wholly by surprise, and- slunk silently away to their retreats, or immediately fled to the British army, whom they still neglected to undeceive. It was about one week subsequent to the events last recited; and the interim had been marked with little, as far as immediately concerned the action of our story, and those of its personages-to whom we must now return - with very little to which pen can do justice, except what the reader's imagination probably has already anticipated; for though thrilling events may be described with a   THE RANGERS, good degree of adequacy, there are yet certain states of high. Wrought feeling that language can never but feebly portray. The search for the lost maiden, on the eventful night of her capture and escape, had been, as the reader will have inferred, as vain and fruitless as it was agonizing to her lover, and anxious to all. The renewal of the search next day, till afternoon, had been no better rewarde . More force having then arrived, the tory encamp- ment was assailed, but found enpty of occupants, who had, some hours before, cattered and fled Still unwilling to relinquish his object, Woodb rn, with a smnal party of his friends, continued his efforts in wid rranges-throu h the forest, which, on the third morning, broug ht him to the cabin in which her most fearful trials had, occurred; when th1 dead wolf, the remnants of the slain Indians, ot yet wholly carried off by the foxes or returning wolves, the guns, the torn and tlood-stained earth, and, above all, the white shreds of some part of female apparel, discolored and seattered round the room, told  tale, that, in spite of the entrea. ties of his sympathizing friends, who deemed the evidence not yet wholly conclusive, drove te appalled lover, in a frenzy of grief and horror, from the drea ful scene. It was about a week, as we h ve said, after that night of adven- ture and  excitement. Three Companies of the newly-enlisted regiment of Ra gers, embracing all the recruits yet raised on the t east side of the mountains, wer paraded in the road before Cof. fin's-tavern, while their officers ere standing listless on the grass in front,and ocasionally throing inquiring glances along the oad -to the east, as if awaiting ome expected arrival from that quarter. At leqgth Woodburn, on whose brow rested an air of gloomy  sternnes,-advanced, and calling his sergeant and .scout. easter, Dunning, to his side, in a low tone, imparted to him some private order or suggestion; when the latter, beckoning from the ;nks-his and the reader's old acquaintance, Bill Piper, who was afilso a subaltern in the same company, the two laid aside their iguns-and equipments, and proceeded leisurely down the road, the Tay in which tie attention of all seemed directed. After pro- 'eeding about a quarter of a mile, they cam to a turn in the lroad;which,  nou- becoming invisible from the tavern, led down a [nghill, and entsered' an extended piece of woods nearly another uarter of a  mile distant. ;  'Weil," said Dunning, here pausing and c isting his eyes for-  g.:to the woo s, "they der don't seem to make their appear S mceyet. I ditt ir think they must have halted there by the brook 1o drink and rest a little; so we will stop at. this point, where we - i   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.   . : can,- see both ways; and when the troops begin to show them- selves, well then give the signal." With this, they threw themselves down in the cool shade of a tree by the way side, and, for a while, yielded themselves to that. listless, dreamy mood, which reclining in the shade, after exer. , cise, on a warm day, almost invariably induces. "Dunning," said Piper, at length rousing up a little, and draw- ing from his pocket a well-filled leathern purse, which, he care, lessly chinked against his upraised knee, by way of preliminary --"Dunning, it is a mystery to me where all ',this stuff comes from. Six weeks ago, it was thought there were scarcely a thobu- sand hard dollars, except what was in -tory families, in all the Gr-ants. Now, there must be well on to that sum even in-our own company, every recruit having been paid his bounty and month's advance pay, in silver or gold, on the spot. Where does it come from?" "From the sales of the- der tory estates, of, which they have been making a clean sweep, you know," replied the other. "Yes, yes, we all know that, I suppose ; but where do the pur- chasers of these estates get the money to buy with?" rejoined the former. "I never ditter catechized them about it," said the hunter, evasively. "Nor I," remarked Piper; " but I have lately heard a curious story about the matter. They say there has been a sort of home- spun-looking old fellow, that nobody seems to know, following the commissioners of sales round, from place to place, with an old horse and cart, seemingly loaded with wooden ware, or some such kind of gear, for peddling; and that he has bid off a great part of all the farms, and stock on them, which have been sold, pay- ing down for them on the spot in hard money, which they say he , carries about with him tied up in old stockings, and hid away in his load of trumpery.

("That last would prove a rather ditter tough bargain for whim and his masters, I reckon," responded the hunter, dryly. "Yes, that is all nonsense, no doubt," observed Piper. '-' But still it is a mystery to my mind, how money, that a short time ago was so scarce, should now all at once be so plenty; and that- was the reason I raised the question before you, who generally know pretty near what is going on among our head men, and who, I thought likely, could easily explain this secret." *       i,   ,          THE BTANGOF,S No," said the other; " no,Bill; there might be der trouble about that.

"Well, I'll be chunked if the project wan't a bold one! But if any creature on earth can carry it out, it is Bart; and he will, unless they get word from this quarter that such a fellow is among them. Ah! I now see the need of a close mouth on the subject, and will keep one, thanking you kindly, Dunning, for your cau- tion and confidence.  "It will be all right, I presume, Bill, now you perceive Bart's neck may depend on your ditter discretion. But who have we there?" added the speaker, pointing down the road towards the woods. While Dunning and Piper were thus engrossed in conversation, two men, on foot, had emerged from the woods and approached within a hundred yards, before attracting the attention of the for. mer. They were without coats, or in their shirt. sleeves, as, in common parlance, is the phrase for such undress; and, having handkerchiefs tied round their heads, and carrying in their hands rough sticks, picked up by the way-side, for canes, they pre- sented an appearance, as they leisurely came along upt the ascending road, with occasional glances back towards the woods, that left Dunning and his companion wholly in doubt, while attempting to decide who or what they were.     I "Now, who knows," said the wary hunter, " but they may e der tory spies, hanging round the skirts of Stark's army, and intending soon to be off cross-lots to the British, to report his prog. ress. I'll ditter banter them a little, at all hazards, before we let 'em pass." But as the strangers drew near, their appearance grew less and less like that of the ordinary footpads for whom they had been taken; and there was something in their bearing which consider- ably shook, though it did not wholly alter, the hunter's intention to banter them. One was a strongly-built, broad-chested man, with a high head, hardy brown features, and a countenance be- tokening much cool energy and decision of character. The other was rather less stocky, and slightly taller, of quicker motions, but withal a prompt, resolute-looking person. "Well, my friends," said the former, coming up and pausing before the expectant Rangers, with an air that seemed to challenge conversation, " this is Coffin's tavern here ahead, I suppose. Will the captain be pleased, think ye, to see a little company about this time?"        . VOL.

"Yes, if of the right sort, he wont ditter cry, I reckon. But the captain is some- times rather particular--for instance, if you should happen to be tories - " "Tories!-do we look like tories?" demanded the former, glancing to his companion with a droll, surprised look. "Why der no," replied the hunter, a little abashed, "I ditter think not." "Well, I had hoped not," rejoined the nran. I , But who are. you, my friend- one of the Green Mountain Boys, that we hear so much about?" "Not far from the mark, sergeant, or commissary, or whatever is your ditter title ; for you belong to the army that's at hand, I take it?" said Dunning. "O, yes," briskly returned the other, again looking at his com- panion, and joining him in a merry laugh. "Yes, I am one of them, and mean to have a hand in stirring up Burgoyne, when we reach him, 1 assure you." "That's right, commissary " exclaimed Dunning. "You are a der chap of some pluck, I'll warrant it. I Begin to ditter like you. What shall I call your name, friend?" -".My name is John Stark, if you will allow," replied the stran- ger, with an amused look. "John Stark? Why, that's your der general's name!" said the hunter, incre'ultusly. 'L Come, come, friend, you are ditter gumming me. I have seen John Stark-- Captain Stark, that was then--now general--the same that was bought back by our folks for a white pony --ditter dog cheap, too, as the British will find, before he is der done with them, or I mistake the amount of fight that's in the critter, amazingly."  "Thank you, sir!" heartily exclaimed the former, now evi- dently as much gratified as amused at what he heard. "In be- half of that same John Stark, I thank you, sir, for your good opinion of him. But where, my good fellow," he continued, with * When General Stark was exposed for sale in Montreal, by the In- dians, by whom he had been captured in the French war, and some of his countrymen were trying in vain to make his savage master set a price on him, an English gentleman happened to ride by on a handsome white pony, which so greatly struck the Indian's fancy, that, pointing after the coveted animal, he exclaimed, "Ah! ugh! me take that you get him." Whereupon the gentleman was followed, the pony purchased, and, with it, the captive Stark redeemed.

"Ah yes, yes, - our hunter guide on that rough march! I remember now. Well, well, the fault is not wholly on one side, after all!" said the other, musingly. Der - der - ditter how? der - ditter - " began Dunning, opening his eyes with an uneasy stare. "This is General Stark, my boys," here quickly interposed the other gentleman. "I see by your badges that you belong to the Rangers. I am your colonel, Herrick, and this the general him, self, who, by way of relief from a longa ride in the saddle, threw off his uniform, like myself, down in the woods yonder, and walked on, while the troops were halting to refresh a moment, and recover from the effects of their march in this scalding heat, be- fore they made their appearance at your rendezvous. They will now be on the move shortly." "Der-- der - ditter--" cried the confused hunter, rising hur- riedly to his feet, and lifting his cap, in a tremor of respectful deprecation, before the general, while his tongue began to trip and fly in the vain attempt to get out an apology - " der - der --ditter - ditter - ditter -" ,' Never mind, my brave fellow!" exclaimed Stark, with a hearty slap on the other's shoulder; "never mind a mistake so naturally growing out of our unmilitary guise. No offence, even had your remarks been less pleasant. But you, sir! - why, you have paid me the greatest compliment I ever had in my life!" "No- no offence whatever to either of us," added Herrick. "But yonder come the columns of our friends and helpers from New Hampshire. If you are here to give notice of their approach, as I suppose, make the signal, and back to your post. And here, general," he continued, pointing to two fine-looking and gayly ca. parisoned horses, now led up by waiters, with the coats, swords, sashes, and great military cocked hats of the denuded officers swinging on their arms --" here, general, come our horses and uniforms. Let us rig up before a worse mistake shall befall us." With a curious mixture of chagrin and gratification at what had just occurred, the two Rangers now made the appointed signal, and   100          THE RANGERS,        mu hurried back to join their companions in arms at the tavern. And in a few minutes, the fine little brigade of the hardy and resolute New Hampshire Boys, headed by their intrepid leader, now equipped in imposing regimentals, and mounted on his curvetting charger, came pouring along the plain in all the pomp of martial array, and were received by the customary military salutes, and the reiterated cheers of their congenial welcomers of the Green Mountains. The hour that succeeded was a bustling and a joyous one. The greetings, the introductions, the mutual compliments for deeds done at Ticonderoga and Bunker Hill, and the merry jokes given and taken, as the mingling forces partook of the good cheer pre- pared for the whole at the expense of the public or patriotic indi- viduals, together with the strong community of feeling that agi- tated their bosoms in view of a common object to be accone. plished, and common dangers to be encountered, - all combined to render the scene one of no ordinary interest and animation. At length, the drums of the-different companies began to beat to arms, and the soldiers were seen gathering at their respective stands, pre- paratory to the march of the combined forces across the mountains. At this juncture, a single horseman came galloping along the road from the west; and, the next moment, Ira Allen, the active and untiring secretary of the Council of Safety, with a counte- nance betokening good or exciting news, rode up tothe door, and, throwing himself from the saddle, turned to receive the greetings of his acquaintances gathering round him. With a sig- nificant look and gesture to Woodburn to follow, he led the way to an unoccupied room, at length found in the crowded'tavern. "What news do you bring, Mr. Allen?" said Woodburn, with an effort at calmness, as soon as the two were by themselves. ' That which will scatter the blackest part of that cloud on your brow, I trust, my dear fellow," replied Allen, with an ani- mated and exulting air. "Here, look at this! ' he added, pulling out and presenting a small and closely-folded letter. With trembling eagerness, Woodburn seized the missive, and, with a glance at the well-known hand of the superscription, "To Captain Woodburn, or Mr. Allen, of the Council," opened it, and read as follows: -  "I am at the British head-quarters -not exactly a prisoner, but evidently a closely-watched personage, having reached here, with my captors, after a fqrced and fatiguing journey, which, however, was not made unpleasant by any disrespectful treat-   OR THE "ORY7S DAUGHTER.       10 ment.

S H We will not attempt to describe the emotions of W oodburn on the occasion. But the letter disclosed that which involved more momentous interests than those merely t hat concerned the indi- vidual feelings of a lover. And it was sdon concluded to lay it before General Stark, who, With Colonel Herrick,was then called in, the letter shown, and all the attending Dircumstances, past and present, so far as concerned the public to know, fully explained. Mean while the troops were drawn up,in marching order, bet fore the tavern, and stood wondering why their general aid not appear, or, at least, give order for the column to move onward. At length, however, the long expected leader, attended by those with whom he had been in consultation,made his appear- ance at the door, and ordered the horses of those who were to travel mounted to be led forward.  on John Stark's  ," There's something more than commo on John Starks mind, whispered a tall New Harr pshire Boy, to his fellow in the ranks. "See how his eyes snap! I am an old neighbor of his, you know, and can read him like a book. I shouldn't be surprised if we heard from him soon; for he an't one of/ those that like to keep chawing on a thing that mkes him feel, but wants to out with it, and always will, unless h has good reason for a close mouth. Yes, PlU bet a goose we hear from him before we start." The speaker had condec ured rightly. Stark was heard to say to Allen, M Mount and ride along against the centre there, sir, where you ca,n best be heard. We must have it for, besides preparing their minds for what they vrobably must soon meet, it will make a battle cry for your boys -and mine as potent, for aught we can tell, as was the name of Joan of Arc among the Frenchmen. The officers, with Allen, then sprung ia to their saddles; and as the latter reached his allotted post, and aced round to the lines, the general commanded attention, and acded,- "My men, let me introduce you to Mr. Allen, the patriotic i secretary of the Vermont'Council of Safety, and say that I hold 9"   d0         THEE RANGERS, myself voucher for the truth of what he shall tell you. Listen to his communication a The secretary, now bowing respectfully to the attentive and already prepossessed ranks before him, began by saying that among the recreant few of any note in the Green Mountains, who had basely deserted their country and joined the enemy, there was one who had a daughter of whom he was wholly unworthy. The speaker then proceeded to relate Miss Haviland's noble stand for the American cause, from which she was not to be allured or driven by all the inducements and menaces held out by a tory father and lover, both of whom had received royal commissions - her absolute refusal to go with them, on their late departure for the British army, and her more recent capture and abduction, while on her way to her friends, by the probable instigation of the rejected lover, and with the connivance, perhaps, of the father; all of which was concluded by reading the letter just received, it was added, by a trusty messenger, who had gone in disguise to the enemy's camp to receive it, and who had now returned to keep open the important communication. "Men of New Hampshire-!" now cried Stark, in a loud, ani- mated voice, as with flashing eyes he glanced over the throng of upturned and excited faces before him, " is it any wonder the Green Mountain Boys are so gallant and brave in fighting for their wives and sweethearts, when such is a specimen? Will you join them in defence of their homes and country, and help fulfil this matchless girl's expectations when we meet that taunt- ing foe at Bennington, as by God's favor we will? If so, then let it now be told in three cheers for the good cause, and as many more as you please for The Tory's Daughter!" The next instant, as the bidden drummers brought their sticks to the bounding parchment of their instruments with blows that seemingly would have thrown their arms from their shoulders, a thousand men were seen leaping wildly into the air, and giving their patriotic response in a round of cheers that rent the ringing heavens above, and shook the, startled wilderness for miles around them. "Order in the ranks!" at length broke in the deep, stern voice of the general, as the last cheer was dying away. "Prepare to march! March!" And the excited troops could scarcely be kept in their places, as,+ with the stirring strains of lively fife and rattling drum, they went rushing and pouring along on their way to the sea: -of war. *   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTESR       103 CHAPTER IX. "In dreams the haughty Briton bore The trophies of a conqueror." THE scene of our story changes to the vicinity of the Hudson, to which the eyes of millions were now turned as the theatre f approaching events, on which hung, perhaps, the great issue f the American revolution. Although both parties seemed to ook upon the matter at stake as one of immense magnitude, yet jar different were the views and feelings which, at this time, per- aded the two opposing armies. The British, flushed by their uccesses, and confident in that strength before which every op- -oosing obstacle had thus far given way, were looking down with -ittle other than absolute contempt on the American forces in -heir front, believing them wholly incapable, either from numbers or courage, of opposing any serious resistance to their march, when they chose to move forward. And here thus lay their broud and infatuated; chief for weeks, dreaming of coronets, -rittering away the time in feasting with: his officers, and indulg- nrg himself and them in all the follies which characterized their gay and licentious camp. On the other hand, the Americans, deeply sensible of the consequence of suffering their enemies to effect their contemplated junction at Albany, were vigilant, active, and determined. Though firmly resolved to dispute the way of the invader to the death when they must, they yet preferred, for \ a while, the policy of embarrassing and' impeding hm, rather than openly exposing themselves to his attacks. Whole brigades were therefore emplyed in the work of destroying the bridges, blocking up the roads with fallen trees, and putting every possible obstruction in the way of his advance, so that his delay, where he now lay at Fort Ann. might be protracted till a sufficient force could be gathered to eet him with a more reasonable hope of success.              ; And every hour that hope waxed stronger and stronger. Every day brought fresh accessions of strength to their self-deavoted bands, and every gal; wafted to their gladdened ears the sounds of the warlike preparations of an aroused and indignant people   104           THE RANGERS, gathering from afar to the rescue, and they began to brea more freely while they thought, as with trembling solicitt they still did, of the fearful meeting that must. now soon 1 low. At the time which we-have selected for opening the see that forms the next connecting link in the chain of our ta although the road had been at length opened, and a few detac ments thrown 'forward to the Hudson, the main part of the Br ish army still lay at Fort Ann; where their long lines of teni m-arked, at intervals, by the colors of the different regimen flying from their slender flagstaffs, were now seen stretchini a city of canvas, over the plain. A little apart from this in posing array stood a small number of dwelling-houses of di ferent sizes, irregularly scattered along on both sides of the roa towards the south, over the largest of which floated the broa British flag, proclaiming it the head-quarters of the commander in-chief.  The next, in size and commodiousness, among these various structures,- all now occupied by the general officers ant other favored personages of the army,-- was a large, low fann house, which the interming ing devices of the British and Han overian fags, conspicuousl displayed from the roof, denoted t be the quarters of General eidesel, suite, and well-k O family This last building seemed now to be the principal point of attraction. Gaylyvdressed officers and ladies were seen entering the doors, or standing inside at the open windows; while the sounds of the familiar greetings, lively sallies, and merry laughter of the as- sembled and assembling company, sufficiently indicated the con- vivial character of the scene about to be enacted within. Let us enter. Around a  long and richly-furnished table, in the principal apartment, were just seated thlose who deemed themselves the elite of that boastful army.- Its notorious chief, the weak and wise, vain-glorious and energetic Burgoyne, occupied the post of honor, at the head, and the fair hostess, the amiable, learned and vivacious Countess of Reidesel, the foot of the table. while at the sides, were ranged, according to the prevailing notions of precedence, the variously-ranked individuals composing the rest of the company, among whorn, with other officers of less note, were Generals Reidesel and Frazier, Major Ackland and his devoted wife, together with several Americans, including the elated Esquire Haviland and his beautiful daughter. The latter, who, sorely against her inclinations, had been prevailed on, or I rather constrained, by her father to attend him to the entertain- ment, was seated by the side of Lady Ackland, to whom she   !'!          OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       105 seemed shrinkingly to cling as a sort of shield against the free "!  glances she was compelled to encounter from the eyes of those g   whom it was there counted treason to repulse. The feast proceeded. With the constant bandying of compli. ment, joke, and repartee,among the merry and self-satisfied lord. lings who assumed the right of engrossing the conversation, course after course carme and passed in rapid succession, till a sufficient variety of viands and other substantial esculents had been served to warrant the introduction of the lighter delicacies of the dessert. But still there seemed to be a saving of appetite, a looking for some expected dish that had not yet made its ap- pearance, on the part of several of the guests, and especially on that of the pompous votary of Mars, who had been installed master of the ceremonies, and who at length ventured to say, - "I had looked, my lady hostess, to have seen, ere this, among your many other delectables, the fulfilment of your ladyship's promise gracing the table, in the shape of the blackbird pie, wherewith we were to be regaled, at your entertainment, if your polite note of invitation was rightly read and interpreted." "O, the blackbird pie!" replied the countess, with a sprightly air and a charming touch of the German brogue. " I was wait- ing to be reminded of that; for there is a condition, which I wish to propose to your excellency, before the promised extra can make its appearance." "Ah! What is that, my incomparable cateress?" asked the forimer. "Why, only that you carve and serve the pie to the company yourself, mon general," archly replied the countess. "A challenge to your chivalry, general, which no true knight can refuse to accept," cried Frazier and others. " I yield me, and accede to the condition," said Burgoyne, gracefully waving his jewelled hand, and joining in the general laugh. l"  It is well," said the countess, with a finely-assumed air of mock gravity, as she raised her exquisite little table bell, which now, under her rapidly-plied fingers, sent its sharp jingle through the house. The next moment, a liveried" servant, whose countenance seemed slyly gleaming with some suppressed merriment, was seen advancing with a broad, deep dish, tastefully crowned by the swelling crust of snow-white pastry, which tightly enclosed the supposed contents beneath. At a motion of the indicating finger of the hostess, the tempt-   106          THE RANGERS, ing dish was brought forward, and carefully placed on the tab before the many-titled carver, amid a shower of compliments 1 the distinguished artificer of so fine an edible structure, from hit and many others of the admiring company. The general nor rose, and, intent only on a dexterous performance of the dutie of his new vocation, gave a preliminary flourish of knife an fork, and dashed into the middle of the pie; when lo! throug] the rent thus made in the imprisoning crust, out flew half a scOr, of live blackbirds, which, fluttering up and scattering over th; dodging heads of the astonished guests, made for the open win dows, and escaped, with loud chirping cries, to their nativE meadows! At first, a slight exclamation from the gentlemen, a half shriek from the ladies, then a momentary pause, and ther one universal burst of uproarious laughter, followed this strange denouenzent of the little plot of the playful countess. She, it appeared, had engaged a fowler to bring her a couple of dozens of blackbirds, which, by a net, he had taken, and brought to her alive; when, keeping part as they were, she contrived up the scheme  to amuse and surpise her guests here described, and, slaying the rest, made of them a veritable pie, that was! now brought forward, and partaken, with great gusto, by the delighted company. At length the cloth was removed, and the table replenished with bottles and glasses. Then followed the usual round of toasts-" the health of the king," - the invincibility of Briiish arms,"-  success to the present expedition,"- and, with manyi a deriding epithet, " confusion to the rebels and their ragged army." "Fill, gentlemen," said Burgoyne, after the subjects above named had been sufficiently exhausted --" fill up your glasses once more; for, in descanting on the public responsibilities and glory of the soldier, let us not be unmindful of those private felici- ties which are to reward his prowess, I give you," he added, with a  significant glance at our heroine-- - "I give you, ladies and gentlemen, the health and. happiness of our twoloyal American officers, Colonel Peters and Captain Jones, the prospective bride- grooms of the double wedding of to-morrow, extremely regretting that both of the fair participants of the happy occasion, instead of one, are not here to give the beautiful response of their blushes to the sentiment." As the lively applause with, which this toast was received and drank was subsiding, the ladies, to the great relief of the aston- ished and confused Miss Haviland, now rose and retired to -another apartment. Here, pleading some excuse for an imme-   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER,      107 diate departure, Sabrey hurried out through a back way, and escaped unperceived to her father's quarters, a small adjoining cottage, where she had lodged since his arrival in camp, and where she now secluded herself, to endeavor to fathom the plot which the unexpected and unwarranted announcement just indi. rectly made, together with some other circumstances of recent occurrence, plainly told was in progress to insnare her. But it may here be necessary, for a clear understanding of some things which have preceded and others which may follow, to revert briefly to the experience of the luckless maiden since placed in her present uncongenial and embarrassing position. When Miss Haviland, on the termination of her compulsory journey, arrived at the outposts of. the British army, she was con- ducted, by the order of some one evidently apprised of her coming, immediately to her father's quarters. The old gentleman, at the somewhat awkward meeting that now took place between them, seemed both surprised and gratified at seeing her there i and though his manner betrayed a sort of guilty embarrassment, arising, perhaps, from the consciousness of his former harshness to her, he yet at once, and pointedly, disclaimed having had any: agency in her abduction, which he laid to the chances of war; to which, he contended, her perverse and unadvised conduct had been the means of exposing her. Peters, also, who soon made his appearance, joined in the disclaimer; and tendering some empty apologies for what had happened, which, he said, grew out of the mistake of a subordinate officer in construing an order in relation to taking hostages from the enemy, in certain cases, offered to convey her back, if she chose it, as soon as found con- sistent with her safety. The offer, however, was never repeated ; and his own conduct very soon belied his assertions, and con- vinced her of the truth of her suspicions from the first, that he was the sole instigator of the outrage she had received, and that it was still his purpose to detain her and keep her in a position which would enable him the more effectually to prosecute his designs; for although in the few formal calls he continued to make at the house, he never pressed his suit, but seemed rather to avoid the subject, as if determined to afford her no opportunity to repeat her former refusals, she yet quickly perceived that he was busy at his intrigues to bring about, by the agency of others, and by secret management, what by himself, or by any open and honorable means, he despaired of accomplishing. All this, from day to day, unfolded itself in the renewed importunities and reproaches of her father, the added entreaties of Jones, the   UO         ITHEi KA1NW;ilfS lover of Miss McRea, then soon expected in the British camp to be married, in the reports which. had been put in circulation to place her in a false light,--that of a perverse and coquettish girl,- in the efforts made to force her into social parties, where the opinions of all were obviously forestalled, and especially in the contrived introductions she was compelled to undergo to those who had evidently been enlisted as intercessors, among whom were some whose ambiguous conduct often greatly annoyed, and, at times, even filled her bosom with perplexity and alarm. Such was the position of the unhappy girl at the time of her reluctant attendance as one of the guests of the merry party we have described. Although annoyed, sickened, and disgusted at what she had daily witnessed, and vexed and indignant at the con- temptible artifices and intrigues of Peters; which, however in- tended, were beginning to be the means of exposing her to new trials, yet, till what took place at that party, she had entertained no serious apprehension that any attempt would be made to coerce her into a marriage which she had so decidedly repudiated. But the announcement which had just been so strangely made, coming as it did from so powerful a personage, and one, at the  same time, whose equivocal behavior, when she had casually met him, had excited her deepest aversion, now gave her to under- stand that such an attempt was indeed about to be made by the assumed arbiters of her fate, and that her resistance to the con. templated scheme,should she be able to make one against the overawing influence that was about to be brought to bear upon her, and even her acquiescence, she feared, Was to be followed by persecutions, from the thought of which she shrunk with dismay. She might have taken that announcement, perhaps, as a mere ruse, as in part it really was, got up to place her in a predicament in which most females would yield rather than become the prin- cipal actor in the scene that would follow further resistance; or she might have viewed the whole as 'a contemptible fabrication, but for a circumstance of that morning's occurrence. Captain Jones had called and apprised, her that he was about sending an escort to Fort Edward for his betrothed, informed her that the next morning was appointed for his wedding, and concluded by making his last appeal to induce her to consent to ibe united to Peters at the same time. And it was this occurrence, in connection with the former, that had so thoroughly alarmed her. While pondering on the means and chances of escaping the. threatened destiny,. she perceived from her window that the com-   OR THE TORY'S DAU8inLr .        - pay at Reidesel's hadl broken up, and were scattering to their r espective quarters. And presently her father entered her room, and  fter announcmg that he had been honored by the comn and e .a mission to Ske-. nesboro', from which he mander-in-chief wirth misst]., "?'-nte d     er  should not be able to eturn till late at ng t, presented her a sealed billet, and inm ediately departed. i With a trembling hand she Op end the susect d missive and read,- "Miss Haviland will pardon the mist ake involvedin the senti- ment delivered at ILay Reidesel's table. Its author, however cannot but thi nk tht the full arrangement which he had supposed to have been already sttled ma y still be effected ineason. And he therefore proposes, f Miss H. will permit, a call for friendly interces ion, at twiligh this evening." With\ a flushed andlashing countenance the offended maiden instantly sprang tol her feet, and paced the room several minutes in silent agitation. Her naturally mild spirit was at length evident- ly aroused for some decided action; and the manner in which it was to be commenced appeared soon to be determined in her mind. "Ay, and the step, as bold as it may be, shall first be taken," she said, as, preparing Ito leave the house, her burning thoughts began to press for utterance. "Ay, if it will not avail me, in bringing aid to escape from this den of iniquity, or protection to remain, it shall, at least, serve as a proclamation of villany, which shall yethe heard in every house and hamlet of the American peo- ple! The next moment she was in the street; and, with hurried step, making her way to General Reidesel's quarters. Instantly seek ing a private interview with the readily assenting countess, she frankly and without reserve told the whole story of her wrongs, and implored assistance in escaping the toils that had been spread for her, or, at leest, the protecting shield of an influence which should enable he r to withstand them. And the effect of her forceful recital son showed her that she had not over-estimated the discernment nd magnanimity of the noble lady she was ad- dressing. s4 Well, that is right, my bonny rebel, as they call you!" said the countess, enc uragingly. "And it is the spirit in a woman which I like, and which I will have no hand in repressing. Yes, I see clearly, now, what I half suspected before --the man who had you brought her, where he could more surely noose you, is re- pugnant even to the misery; and some of those he has been fool enough to enlist as intercessors, are still more dreaded. Ah! I OL. ItI.   10   'll0         THE RANGERS, wicked, wicked Briton! But, do you know, he is king here, and that it is treason to talk, and worse treason to try to thwart him?" "I have greatly feared so, my lady." "What, then, do you propose to do, wherein I could befriend you?"? "Leave the army before night." "Have you a carriage at command, and a protector'?" "I have, strictly speaking, neither, madam." "Then how can you go?" "On foot, and alone, unless I chance to engage one to attend me in the character of a servant." "You are a brave one, my young lady. But they will be likely to detain you at the outposts." "I had supposed so, and therefore came here with the hope that, after you had heard my story, you might be moved to pre- vail on your husband to give me a pass." "O girl, girl No, no, he would not dare to do it, after finding out the cause, which he must first know," exclaimed the lady, in a tone of kindly remonstrance. "He would dare do no such thing. But I Would, in such a case; indeed I would! 'And, stay, let me see!" she continued, rising and opening the general's desk. "Here are several passes which he keeps for occasions of hurry, all signed off and ready, except inserting the name of the bearer. O, what shall I do? I am tempted to write your name in one, and trust to your honor and shrewdness to shield me, in case of your failure, from exposure and blame." "Will your hand-writing be acknowledged, madam?" "O, yes, I don't hesitate on that account; for I often fill up the general's passes under his direction." "O, then, dear madam, as I know you would do by a daughter, do by me - trust to my discretion, and hesitate no longer." The good-hearted countess soon yielded, and our heroine, with tears of gratitude, mutely imprinted a farewell kiss on her cheek, and departed with the coveted pass in her pocket. When Miss Haviland reached her chamnber, she seated herself by an open, but partially curtained window, where, unseen her- self, she could easily note what was passing in the street below, to which her attention seemed somewhat anxiously directed. She had been but a few minutes at her post of observation, before she was apprised, by the hooting of boys, and the gibes and laughter of the idling soldiers, with whom the street, at this hour, was commonly thronged, that some unusual spectacle was approach-   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER. ing. And peerng forward through the folds of the curtains, she beheld, amidst a slowly advancing crowd, a meanly-clad, simple looking country youth, wearing ragged broad-brim, and mounted on an unsightly, donkey-like beast, whose long tail and mane were stuck full of briers, and whose hair, ying .in every direc- tion, seemed besmeared with mange and dirt; all ombying to give both horse and rider a most ungainly and poverty-struck- appearance. The fellow was trying to peddle apples, which he carried in an old pair of panniers swung across his pony s back, and which seemed to be bought mostly by the boys, who with them were pelting him and his cringing pony, to the great mirth of the bystanders. While the crowd, and the object of their at- tention, were thus engaged, at a little distance, an officer, who was passing, paused near the house, and, calling a couple of soldiers to his side, said to them,--- "Keep your eyes on that fellow with the scurvy pony yonder, and if you notice any thing suspicious in his movements, arrest him. It appears to me I have seen him in almost too many places to-day." An expression of concern passed over Sabrey's countenance, as she heard these words, and she gave an involuntary glance to the object thus pointed out, who, as she thought from his appear-s ance, had also heard the order himself, or at least guessed its import. But instead of making off, as she expected, he spurred up his pony, and, coming directly up to the officer, asked him, uwith an ar of confiding simplicity, to buy some of his apples, which he said were " eny most ripe and gand for pies ing the , Who are you, fellow r" said the officer, without heding the other's request. , Who I be? I am Jo Wilkins. But aint you going to buy some of the apples?" persisted the former. , -Blast your apples!" impatiently replied the officer; "that Whom are you for   King or Congress?" interrupted the officerho be ongus?

King or Congress?" interrupted the   1         ' THE RANGERS, "Yes, yes; but you must tell me, honestly, what you cam4 here for to-day, and who sent you, my lad." "Why, dad sent me to sell the apples, cause he wants the money to buy some rye with. But I've been all round, and ain sell'd half, they kept bothering me so. And now its time to g hum, and nobody won't buy 'em!" said the speaker, with a doleful tone, and evident signs of snivelling. "Well, well, myhonest lad" responded the commiserating and now satisfied officer; "don't mind it--nobody wants to harm you. There is half a crown to pay you for my part of the 'bothering." "Why, you going to buy 'em all?" eagerly asked the other, as, with a grin of delight, he clutched the precious metal. "No, no," said the former, kindly. "I don't wish for any of your apples--they are tool green, though they may do for cooking. You would be most likely to sell them in some of these houses." "Well, now, I vown! I never thought of that! jest's likely's not I mought, you!" exclaimed the fellow, brightening up. "Good mind to go right straight into this ere house and try it- will, by golly!" he added, leaping nimbly from his pony, swing- iong is panniers on his arm, and hurrying off round for the back !   door. Don't molest the poor simpleton any more, but disperse to your quarters," said the officer, now waving his ratan to the scattering crowd, and resuming his walk up the street. Waiting no longer than to hear this order, and see that it was about-to be obeyed by the crowd, Sabrey hurried down to the kitchen, where she encountered the object of her solicitude standing within the door, holding up the half crown between the fingers of one hand, and snapping those of the other, with a look that needed no interpreting. "Your disguise, Bart," said the maiden, looking at the other with a  smile - your disguise is so perfect, or rather, the new character, in which you this time appear, has been so well acted, that had it not been the afternoon you set for your third appear- ance, I  should have never known you. I think you make a better Quaker boy than you did a  crazy man last time, or buffoon and tumbler the first one. But what have you been able to gather, to-day?" "Pretty much all that's afoot, guess.  The movement on Bennington is begun. Peters's corps of tories and Indians have gone on to Cambridge; and he, who is off to the lake, to-day, to   OR THE TORYtS DAUGHTER.       113 consult with fkene and others about the expedition, is to follow, some time td-morrow, as in the German regiment picked out for the service. Got at it all, think?" "Nearly. It is the plan, however, I understand, that when the stores are secured at Bennington, the troops are to proceed to Manchester, make prisoners of all the Council of Safety, and others of th3 principal' men whom they can find, and return through Arlington." "They've got to" get there, first, guess, and then catch 'em afterwards. But have you fixed out a letter about that and other 'things, ready for me to take?- I'm aching to be off with the news."  ! "No, Bar-. I have just discovered plots to entrap me that have made me resolve to die before I will remain here any longer. My old persecutor, and others a thousand times more powerful, are in league against me." "The gir that killed the wolf would stand the racket against big bugs and all, rather guess, if she tried it. Don't know, though, being about woman matters so." "Av, sir, to a woman there are human monsters more terrible than all the wolves of the forest. And I am determined on at- tempting to escape from this place without another hour's delay; with you, if you will permit." t"Yes, glad to go into it; and by Captain Harry's request, I was a going to propose the same thing myself, even without your new reasons. But this getting you off before dark, which you name, may be rather ticklish, miss. How did you think to manage it?" "Look at this, sir!" said Sabrey, exhibiti g her permit by way of rep-y. "Signed by a man whose authority, I think, will not be questioned, and allowing me, with my servant, to pass through the lines to my friends in the country. I engage you to act as that servant, Bart." "I vags, now, if that aint lucky!" exclaimed the former, with glistening eyes. "Yes, lucky enough, whether it come by ploughing with heifers or steers. But, let's see a bit, though. How will m-y turning servant to a lady, all at once, tally with the stories -'e been telling, -that is, till we get beyond all who heard 'em? Don't know about that. But look here, miss!" he added, beckoning the other to the window. ("Do you see that tail old pine, standing alone, nearly in a line with the road, a mile or so off there, at the south?" ' Yes, very clearly." 10    I  .    , jl'    "Well, that tree, which is beyond, and out of sight of the last pickets, stands near a house where a widow woman lives, who washes fine clothes for some of the officers, but wants to keep in with all sides, and so asks nc, questions and tells no stories.

If I am, do not desert me, Bart, but return to this kitchen at d sk." "Agreed!   But you'll go it without the ifs, I reckon," said Bart, swinging his panniers o his shoulder, and departing with full confidence in his ability to effect an escape perilous to them both, but made much more so to him by the new charge he had so cheerfully undertaken.   CHAPTER X. "( But a gloom fell o'er their way, A fearful wail went by." FORTUNATELY for Miss Haviland, all those who had been enltsted to act as spies upon her movements happened, that afternoon, to be absent, or busily engaged in a quarter of the enqampment from which all view of her proposed path of escape wan intercepted by intervening buildings. Much to her relief, therefore, on setting out on her perilous journey, she was permit- ted to pass forward through the street unquestioned, and without exciting any particular observation. And when she arrived at the outpost, the soldier on duty, with a bare glance at her offered pads, respectfully motioned her to proceed on her way. A short wa k then brought her to the aouse to which she had been dir cted ; and here, finding every thing in readiness, she immedi- ately mounted the now strangel -improved pony, and, with her trusty attendant on foot, set forward, at a quick pace, in the main road leading from the lake to Fort Edward. Their way was now mostly through a deep forest, and over a road which every where exhibited evidence with what perseverance and skill the Ameri- ca/s had labored to destroy and block it up, and with what in- cre dible exertions it had been reopened by their opponents, wholly untaught in the easiest modes of accomplishing the Herculean task. In some places, long causeys over miry morasses had been entirely torn up, and every log of which they were composed drawn off beyond the means of recovery ; and, in others, streams ha I been dammed up, causing ex;ensive overflows, or turned from their natural channels, and thus made to wash out impassable gulfs. Every bridge had disappeared, and all the surrounding ti her rendered useless for constructing more; while, for mile after mile, ore continued mass of gnarled and crooked trees, he 'e pitched :ogether in seemingly inextricable tangles, and there pild mountains high, had been felled into the road, which even no had scarcely been made passable by the toiling thousands w o, for weeks, had been employed upon it. In consequence of this, and t e time spent in making circuits round in the woods,  i    "6     1 THE RANGEaS, to avoid parties of the enemy, who were seasonably discovere by the wary guide to be still at work, in Several places, in try to improve some of the worst portions of the road, the progrey of our heroine was slow and foilsome.

Yes, we tray as well be turning in here ] lam thinking."   laccordance with the plan jr st suggested, Miss Haviland now turned her willing steed, and plunged directly into the dark foresl bore ing the road on the left. Here following her guide, who kelt some rods in advance to select and point out the places affrding the!most feasible route through the thick undergrowth sh, slowly, and with no little personal inconvenience, made her wa, forward in the proposed direction, till she at length sue- cendeid in, reAching the desired station, which was the top of a low, w ody bluff, commanding, from some portions of it, a near and ditinct view of the hamlet, in the opening below, of which the in nded reconnoissance was to be made. Bart, now assisting the rr aiden to dismount, and directing her attention to a mossy hi lock at hand, as an eligible seat or bed for resting herself, tu neI the pony loose to crop the bushes, and disappeared to commence his observations. In a few minutes he returned, and, ha'vir g reported the discovery of a safe and easy route for pass. iqg to the east of the public road, as far as it might be necessary tavoid it, proceeded to reconnoitre the houses below. And t ing a well-screened seat on a log, lying on the verge of the b uff, he looked long and intently. "Well, sir, what discoveries are you making there?" at length a ke3 Sabrey, wondering at his prolonged silence. "Why, nothing very alarming, be sure," replied the other. "Tke place looks as if it was deserted, except one house; but t ere's something going on about that which I don't somehow emn to understand. Suppose you throw a few of those ever- reen vines near you over your head and shoulders, to prevent  our dress from attracting notice, and come here to help me read ut the puzzle." In compliance with the unexpected suggestion, the maiden i stantly rose, and, preparing herself, as directed, cautiously advanced and seated herself at his side. The road they had jecently quitted was in plain view, a little distance to the right, nd continued distinctly visible as it swept round towards the road Hudson, whose tranquil surface was gleaming with the 'eflected brightness of the low-descending sun. On each side f the road, till it disappeared over a distant swell, were scat-   "8 THE RANGERS, tered, at irregular intervals, the dwellings to which allusion has stood, in a retiredong ne nearest and most respectable of these stood, in a retired situation considerably to thepetableast of the higse, psng the questionable appearances to which Bart s attention had be/miren en ne reeaances t h   i and impatiently pawi ng the ground, a noble-loo king h bqut then tood  n tibledlooki           horse,: equipped with a richlyccapadrsoned sde-saddle; while nearby, under the fence, sat, patiently smokin their 's cmhotreme-nt , w 'as ehident'n  by their contrasted bearing and ac. eoutrementsg was a chiesand the other two his attendants.

It was, indeed, that -lovely and hapless girl, pass- ing through the last trial she was destined ever to be conscious of undergoing, - that of the distracting conflict of emotions produced by being nowj finally compelled to decide between the behests of prudence and of love,--between the advice and entreaties of confessedly kind and judicioi relatives, and the opposing coun- sels and impassioned importunities of an idolized lover. Deeply and anxiously, that afternoon, had the thought of her situation engrossed the mind of our heroine, who both expected and dreaded to meet her on the way--expected, because her coming had been announced; and dreaded, not only on account of the pain it would occasion to witness her disappointment, and resist her en- treaties; but also on account of the danger of the unintentional betrayal which would be likely to attend a meeting with that guileless creature of the affections and her probable escort. And it was now wjith the TUingled emotions naturally called up by the associations of former, friendship, the contrast between the circum- stances of thy past ard present, together with fears and anxieties for the future, that Sabrey, after a few brief explanations to her attendant, resumed he" observations of the scene before her, which, she hoped, rmight still result in the triumph of wisdom over the delusive pleadings of love. At length,! she who had now become the principal object of solicitude in the family group, to which the attention of our con- cealed spectators had been directed, followed, with slow arid hesi- tating steps, her still Importuning friends into the yard, where, in her bridal robes of vestal white, and with her rich profusion of bright and wavy tresses hanging like a golden cloud over her shoulders, she stood lat once a vision of loveliness and an object of commiseration. Again and again did those friends appear to renew their entreaties, at which the agitated girl seemed some- times to waver, and 't others to reply only with her tears; till at length the former, evidently wearied with their fruitless attempts, and despairing of success, ascended their vehicle, and drove off at a rapid pace, along the road to the south, without turning their heads to look behind them. Once, as she stood, like'one bound by some fatal spell to the spot, wistfully gazing after the receding 1     E          *   1w0     -    THE RANGERS, wagon, a momentary relenting appeared to come o'r the wretched maiden. She irresolutely ran forward a few paces and, imploringly stretching forth her white arms, uttered faint, sobbing crypf," Come back! O, comed back!"But the late ippeal, which woul have so gladdened the hearts of those for whom it was intended, was destined to, be unheeded. The cry was lost in the din of t eir rattling wheels, as they urged on their ho es, as if anxious t escape from the painful scene. And the por girl, dropping her arms, and turning hopelessly away to a smll11 tree near by, leaned against the trunk for support, and, for awhile seemed to yield herself wholly a prey to the wild grief which now burst rth from the dreadful conflict of emotions that was rending her distracted bosom. At length she appeared to be slowly regai ing her self-possession, and now soon fully arousing herself, she dvanced towards the Indians, and, by signs, sionified her readines to attend them. With eager alacrity, the hore was led up for her to the door-step; when, lightly throwing herself into the saddle, she immediately set forth along the road to the north, preceded by the chief, and followed by his dusky assistants. I  "Well, the poor thing has settled it at last,' observed Bart, draw ing a long brath. But I aint so sure th those red charSters, who appear 1o feel so crank at having go her started, will be allowed to get far with their prize, without seeing trouble".  "Why, sifr " asked Sabrey, wiping away the sympathetic tears that had started to her cheeks at what she had been witnessing - "why -do yo  make such a remark "    s   r Well, it may not amount to any thing, be sure," replied the other. 'But having had   ne eye or the lookout, during this affair at the house, I noticed, a while ao, some five or six scouts, slying along on the other bank of lithe river, over there, and crossing in a boat, and entenring the woods on this side. By their appearance, I think they must be Continentals from our army below; and if it is these Indians they have been spying out, and are after, they will waylay them along here somewhere, likely."       ,      I "O, if they could but take her from these creatures, and send her to her friends!" said the former, with emotion Yes, but I  hope they won't attempt iti' said Bart; , for if these Redskins, who are probably'to have a s art price for getting her safe to camp, should find themselves about to be robbed of her, there's no telling what they would do." X At this juncture,their attention was arrested by the sounds of   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.      121 footsteps approaching in the road from the north; and, the next moment, a second party of Indians, headed by a tall, fierce-look- ing chief, emerged into view, and advanced nearly to the edge of the woods; when the chief, beholding the other party coming on with their charge, suddenly halted, and stood awaiting their approach, with an air of doubt and disappointment, and with looks that plainly bespoke his jealous fears of losing the reward, which, it appeared, the short-sighted lover, in his impatience at the delay that had occurred, had offered him also to bring off his betrothed. The bold and arrogant air of the newly-arrived party, standing in the middle of the road, and seemingly intending to dispute the path, caused the others, as they now came up, to pause, as if 'for parley or explanation; when a fierce and angry debate arose between the rival chiefs, in which the new comer, with dark scowls and menacing gestures, demanded the exclusive possession of the lady, which the other, at first mildly, and then in a tone of defiance, persisted in refusing. At length the latter, under the pretence of wishing to obtain water, but with the real object, probably, of avoiding a collision till some compromise could be effected, approached the alarmed maiden, and led her horse out into a little opening in the bushes on the left, where a cool and inviting spring was seen bursting from beneath the wide-spreading roots of a stately pine-tree standing in the background ; and here leaving her under the shade of the tree, still sitting on her horse, he and his attendants gathered round the spring for the purpose of quenching their thirst. At this instant, white streams of smoke, followed by the startling reports of muskets, suddenly burst from a neighboring thicket, and the band of concealed scouts, with challenging hurrahs, were seen springing from their coverts, and rapidly gliding from tree to tree towards the spot. The astonished and unprepared Indians, who had escaped death only by the dis- tance from which the missiles of their assailants had been dis- charged upon them, all, with one accord, slunk instantly away. into the surrounding bushes. Scarcely had they disappeared, however, before the tall chief, whose ill-omened appearance and conduct we have noted, again. darted out into the opening; when, with a quick, wild glance around him, and a yell of fiendish triumph, he rapidly whirled his arm aloft, and, the next instant, the glittering tomahawk was seen, like a shooting gleam of light, swiftly speeding its way on its death-doing errand. One solitary, piercing shriek, suddenly cut short, and sinking into an appalling groan, rose from the fatal spot; while the white VOL. II.  11 .   122           THE RANGERS, -robes of the victim, like the ruffled pinions of some- suddenly- struck bird, came fluttering to the ground. The deed Wias done; and the spirit of the beauteous and unfortunate Jane MeRea had left its mangled tenement and fled forever! * A momentary pause ensued; when, amidst the intermingling shouts and cries of murder and vengeance, that now birst from both scouts and Indians, the fiend-like perpetrator of the foul deed, who had been seen to leap forward towards his fallen victim with his scalping-knife, bounded back into the road, and, there hold- ing up and shaking the gory trophy at his rival, imrnrediately plunged into the forest and disappeared. The next moment a detachment of British cavalry, who had been sent out to intercept the scouts, came thundering down the road, and put an end to the tumult. Turning away in horror from the spot, now made dan- gerous by the presence of the British, who, on seeing ;.liat was done, and learning the facts, soon began to scatter in all directions after the murderer, Miss Haviland and her guide hastily resumed their journey by the route which the latter had discovered for avoiding the road, and which they pursued till dark, when, arriv- ing at the house of a family in the interest of the American cause, they found a comfortable shelter for the night, and the repose so much needed to counteract the effect of the agitating events of the day on our heroine, and fortify her for tie trials yet in store for her. * From the various published accounts of the massacre of Miss M-cRea, we have followed, in our illustrations of that melancholy tragedy, as far as our limits and plan permitted us to carry them, the one deemed by us the most probable. By way of finishing the details of the horrible scene, however, it may be proper here to state, that Captain Jones, the strangely infatuated lover, having despatched, for the reward of a barrel of rum, one party of Indians after her, and then a second one, for the same reward, had started to meet her, when, encountering the murderer with t'le scalp, which he recognized by the peculiar color and length of the hair he has- tened, in a state bordering on absolute distraction, to the fatal scene. A British officer, with a few attendants, had, in the mean time, removed the corpse to a wagon by the road side, and was guarding it, when the lover arrived to claim it. But his lamentations were so terrible, and his conduct so frantic, that it was deemed advisable to remove him, and bury the re- mains from his sight. From that hour, the bereaved lover was an altered and ruined man. And he died soon after, as there is every reason to be- lieve, of a broken heart.   123 OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.  CHAPTER XI. "Still on? Have not the forest gloom, The taunt of foes, the threatened doom, Shaken thy courage yet?" THE indefatigable Bart, after seeing the object of his greatest solicitude in safety for the night, that of his next, his loved Lightfoot, well stabled and fed, and, lastly, his own wants supplied, determined, with his usual caution and forethought, on making a little tour of observation to Fort Edward, now some miles -in the rear, for the purpose of gathering what new intelligence could be gained respecting the movements of the enemy, which might both enhance the value of his budget of news to carry home, and enable him to shape his course more understandingly and safely on the morrow. Accordingly, in the new disguise of a barefooted, bareheaded, coatless farmer's boy, with a basket of green corn to sell for roasting slung on his arm, he proceeded on foot to the recently-established rendezvous of the enemy at the place above named, and boldly entered their encampment. --Here he soon made discoveries that filled him with-uneasiness, and, finally, those which thoroughly alarmed him for his own and the safety of his charge. The whole camp was in a st te of bustle and commotion. Colonel Baum, in anticipation of the time fixed, for his march, had just arrived with his appointed force, and was intending, after allowing his troops a short respite, to press immediately forward that night on the contem- plated expedition. Bands of painted Indians, who had also ar- rived from the main army since dark, were feasting and drinking in grim revelry, or enacting the frightful war-dance, on the out- skirts of the encampment. Parties of tories were constantly coming in from the surrounding towns, receiving arms, and de. parting to their different allotted stations, to act as pickets to the force about to advance, or as scouts to scour the country along the road to the south. And at last, to crown all, Peters and Haviland, with a small number of attendants, all bearing, on their bespattered persons, evidence of hard and rapid travelling, rode hurriedly into camp, and announced that a dangerous spy   124         THE RANGERS, had, that afternoon, been at the head-quarters of the main army, audaciously abducted a young lady, and with her escaped in this direction, for the arrest of whom a handsome reward should be paid. "It is time you and I was jogging, Bart," muttered the unsus. pected personage within hearing, who deemed himself not the least interested in this unexpected announcement, as he gradually edged himself out of the camp, and made his way, with unusual haste, back to his quarters for the night. Scarcely had the first faint suffusions of morning light begun to be distinguishable in the chambers of the east, before the well. recruited Lightfoot stood pawing at the door, as if impatient to receive and bear off her precious burden from the scene of danger. In a few minutes, the fair fugitive, in answer to the summons of her vigilant attendant, came forth, evidently refreshed by her repose, and, in a good measure, recovered from the shock occasioned by the sad and fearful spectacles of yesterday. Without any allusions to the startling discoveries he had made since they parted for the night, o:her than the quiet remark that he had ascertained that it might not be wholly safe for them to proceed any longer in the main road, Bart assisted the lady to mount, and led the way on their now doubly difficult and- haz- ardous flight. Striking off obliquely to the left, into a partially cleared pine plain, and then, after thus proceeding a while, again turning to the right, they directec their course forward in a line parallel to the great thoroughfare to the south, but at a sufficient distance from it to insure them against the observation of all who might be passing therein, or scouting along its borders. And on, on, now through open fields, and now through dense forests, now through splashy pools, or rapid rivers, and now over sharp pitches or deep ravines, now in cross-roads or cow-paths, and now in trackless thickets, now over fenny moors, and now along the rocky declivities of mountains, on, oil, did they pursue their toilsome and weary way through the seemingly interminable hours of all the first half of that eventful day. At length, however, believing themselves many miles beyond the rendezvous of Peters's corps, who were understood to have been selected as the pioneers of the expedition, they emerged from the woods, and fell into the main road leading up the winding Walloomscoik to the village of Bennington. Greatly rejoiced that, at last, she could be permitted to travel in a smooth road with some assurance of safety, and encouraged by the prospect of soon reaching the friends and acquaintance of her   OR THE TORYUS DAUGHTER.       125 old neighborhood, from whom she was confident of a cordial welcome, our heroine now rode on with lightened feelings and renewed spirits. But she soon perceived, by the manner of her guide, as he examined the appearances of the road, as he went on, and occasionally cast uneasy glances before and behind him, that he did not consider it yet time to rejoibe. And soon he stopped short, and observed,- -  "There are too many tracks in this road for my liking, and not of the right kind to read well, either." "I hope you will indulge in no unnecessary alarms, Bart," said the other, reluctant to leave the road, as she supposed he was about to advise. "You, who yesterday manifested little uneasiness, to-day, when we are farther removed from danger, have appeared extremely cautious and apprehensive, I have thought. Why such a change, while the reverse would seem so much more rational?" "Well, miss, the question is not so onnatural as it might be, I reckon," replied the former; " and I have been expecting you'd wonder some why I led you on such a jaunt as we've had. But the fact was, your chance of getting off has been a little scaly, to. day, to say nothing of the shadow of a rope that's been round my own neck in the mean time." \ "I cannot comprehend you, Bart," said the maiden, with a look of surprise and concern. "Spose so; for I have held in, cause I thought I wouldn't worry your mind till needful, which it may be now; so I'll tell you the whole kink," replied Bart, proceeding to relate his last night's discoveries, and then adding,- "Now a party of the enemy - for I saw a moccason track just now, and none on our side would be in such company as that means - a party of 'em have gone on before us; and my notion is, that we strike off through this bushy pasture to the left." "Let us do so, then, if such is our situation, and that without a moment's delay," cried Sabrey, in alarm at the unexpected disclosure. "Well, perhaps it an't best to fret about it, jest at this minute," responded the imperturbable guide -"I kinder want to make an observation or two, before we start," he added, ascending an elevation near by, which commanded a view of the road both ways for a considerable distance. After glancing along the road in front, a moment, he turned and bent his searching gaze in the other direction, where lhe "   126-         THE RANGERS, soon appeared to discover something that both interested and disturbed him. I "It is, by Herod! it is the whole main body, Germans and all, at their rations, within a mile of us, and their pickets on the move in this direction!" he at length exclaimed, hastily quitting his post of observation. Hurrying down to the side of the startled maiden, he sprang to the nearest length of the fence, here enclosing the road, and grappling, with main strength, the topmost of the heavy poles of which it was composed, soon effected a breach sufficiently low to allow the horse to leap over without endangering the seat of the rider. "' Here, go it, Lightfoot! gently! there you are! Now off with ye, as if the divil was at your heels!" cried Bart, as the horse, with her fair burden, dashed lightly through the breach, and cantered off in the direction indicated by the finger of her mnaster. Pausing to replace the fence, lest the opening should attract the notice of those coming on behind, Bart rapidly followed, and, in another minute, t ie fugitives were safely screened from observation by the thick foliage of the different clumps of bushes, which they managed to keep between them and the road they had just quitted. "There is a ltouse," said Bart, musingly, after they had pro- ceeded a while in silence-" there is a house about half a mile head, and nearly the same distance from the great road, with woods between, which is a place I called at when I came down, and which I had been all along calculating to turn off to, for a slort stop, as we might shape our course to do now, if not some- ehat risky." "A little rest i and refreshment would cert inly be very ac- cl ptable," said thb other, " if it could be safely obtained. Who li es there? i "Well, some folks." "Loyalists ." a "Tories, d'ye mean? No, not by a jug full." "Who are they, then, sir?" "The man," said Bart, glancing up to his wondering com- PInion, with an odd air of shyness, as he provokingly persisted in his evasions- ' the man is one of Warner's sergeants, and a scrt of relation to somebody that I thought likely would be, visiting'at his house by this time. And-and I guess we'll Wnture there, considering," he added, sudden y dashing some distance ahead, urder pretence of pointing out the way.      I         .            '   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.        s      ; After winding their course a while am ong the variously grouped little thickets that studded the old pasture, they at length entered  ta ll forest of maple, which the incisions in the trees, together a tal forest 'o .-f-  ',' .....-'.e th at they soon reached, pro, with the maks of an old boiling-pace , that they soon reahe e, claimed to be the sugar orchard, belong, obabyto  the estabP  lshmenttheywere seeking. And, now falling into a beaten pathe mnt they were seeking ,u   .   iwct they soon perceived, by the glimpse of an opening which theyar Occtasionally caught through the trees, that they were drawing near to the object of their search. The serpentine course of thepath, however, and the undergrowth, so thick as to be nearly impervi  us to the sight, prevented any direct view of the opening ; and tius to the sight, preveons of itspropinquity,          : they passed on without any very exact notions of itspropinquity, till a sudden turn of the path brought them unexpectedly to the edge of the wood, and in full view of the house, not a hundred  yards distant; when, to their astonishment and dismay, they be- held the place in possession of a large party of the enemy. Bart instantly caught the bridle, and was turn ing the horse for the purpose of fleeing back into the forest, when five or six armedng men sprang out from the bushes behind and around them, cutting dff their retreat in every direction. And the next moment they were prisoners to the minions of the vindictive Peters. Bart's quick eye had told him, at- a glance, that there wasno chance for him to escape; and, before his natural looks could be noted, he had become transformed into a lout of so stolid and inoffensive an appearance, that s captors seeme  d greatly dis be appointed, and evidently entertaed dubts hether   it whas the one they supposed they were about to secure. And it was the one they supposed   ellow-prisoner hadubee not till his pale and trembling fellowprisoner had been conducted off on her horse some rods, that they could make him seem to ompreff onhend that he was a risoner, and must go with them. He comprehend that be was a priog and, passively rece'. then burst out into a piteous fit of weepng and, passively reeiv ing the kicks and cuffs of his keepers to get him in motion, went bawling along, like a whipped schoolboy, towards the house. "I thought 'twould be jes so!" he exclaimed, b etween his sobs and outcries. "I most knowed when that man hird father to have me go to show the woman the way--I most knowed s   he was running away, and would get me into some scrape. Then the rmanmlike enough, had done som ething, so he darsent go any furder with'her. And now          me-boo-hoo O0-00-O! 5           ' "Cond^uct the lady into the house!" said the officer in om ondcas the prsoners were led into the yard  cducther mnto, as the prihouse, and set a guard roners wound it, till orders can be got   Ii28         THE RANGERS, from the colonel. And as to this bawling devil," he continued, tirning with a scrutinizing, but somewhat staggered look, to the blubbering Bart, " take him to the barn, where I just noticed spme good cords, bind him hand and foot, and guard him closely. He will make less noise within an hour from new, I fancy." "But, your honor," began one of the scouts who had brought ir the prisoners ---- "4 Yes, yes," interrupted the other, "I have just been informed o his pretences; but there's an even chance that he is sham- ming, -and the fellow we want, after all. Do as I have ordered." Bart was now led into the open barn, which stood facing the yrd ,and projecting in the rear over a steep bank, making from the floor, on the back side, that was also open, a perpendicular fall of nearly a dozen feet. He was then ordered to sit down in tha middle of the floor, when two of the half dozen keepers who hal him in charge, with many a half taunting, half pitying joke at his doleful whimpering, carelessly proceeded to prepare the co rds for binding him, while the rest laid aside their guns, and we nt searching about the barn for eggs, all, notwithstanding the caution of their commander, being evidently so -much impressed wi;h the idea of his innocence as to disarm them of the vigilance usually exercised on such occasions. At this juncture, just as the two men, one standing before and the other behind him, were in the act of stooping to take his legs and arms, Bart -started to hs feet with the suddenness of thought, and giving the one in his rear a paralyzing kick in the pit of his stomach, grappled roupd the legs of the other, and, bearing him, in spite of all his struggles,-across the floor, leaped with him from the verge to the ear h below. Managing to keep uppermost in th6 descent, Bart, as the man struck heavily on the ground, leaped unhuirt from the senseless body, and, with the speed of a wild deer, made his way to tie nearest point of woods, which le fortunately reached just in time to avoid the volley of bullets that was sent after him by the rallying guard from whom he had so strangely escaped. While the palked tories, in the general commotion that now ensued, were giving vent to their rage and mortification, in cursing one anoth. er and the more particular object of their wrath, whom they con- eluded it was useless to pursue, a long, shrill whistle was heard issuing from another point of the forest, to which it was thought the escaped prisoner could not have had time to pass round. Scarce- ly had the sound died away, when a movement, accompanied by a low snorting, was heard in the high-fenced cow-yard, into which Lightfoot had been turned for safe keeping. The whistle was   OR THi9 TORY'S DAUGHTER. o1 soon repeated, and the next moment the sagacious animalwas seen rearing herself nearly upright in the air, and then, With-a prodigious leap, throwing herself over the fence into the field beyond. Although the tories, for a while, as little comprehended this movement of the pony, as they did, at first, that of her mas. ter, yet they raised the alarm that the horse had broken away; and a dozen men threw down their guns, and ran out into the field to head her; but, dashing at and through them, like a mad Fury, she bounded off at full speed, and soon disappeared in the woods in the direction in which the whistling had been heard, leaving the baffled pursuers and their associates now fully. to perceive how completely they had all been outwitted and outdone by both horse and master. Much of our happiness is the result of contrast. A slight alle- viation, unexpectedly springing out of a disheartening misfortunei not unfrequently affords a comparative pleasure more keenly appreciated than unalloyed blessings arising out of the ordinary circumstances of life. The pleasure of Miss Haviland was equalled only by her surprise, when, on entering the house, she found her former fellow-prisoner, the sprightly and fearless Vines Howard, a transient but favored inmate, whose presence here now fully explained the enigmatical language of Bart, on the way, while it soon raised a shrewd suspicion of the cause of the awkward shyness he had exhibited in making his partial and- roundabout revelations. Their mutual salutations, inquiries, and explanations, had scarcely been exchanged, before they were called to the window by an outcry and commotion among the tories without; when they had the unspeakable satisfaction of witnessing the escape of Bart, for whose situation and fate they had both, from different causes, felt the deepest commiseration and the most gloomy apprehensions. ' Now, " said the animated Vine, as she turned exultingly away':-- from the gratifying scene that had opened by the escape of Bart, and closed by that of his pony - " now, Sabrey, if-they will let you remain here till dark, I will see what I can do towards effect- ing your escape, which, to be candid about it, I mainly vcanme here to favor. But whether-you escape, remain, or are dragged back to the British camp, I will not this time be separated from you." 'The proffered assistance of the spirited girl, however, at 'least so far as related to the contemplated attempt to escap6 by night-: was not destined to be called in requisition. 'In a short time, a messenger was seen to arrive; upon which the whole party of   tories commenced preparations for an immediate departure. Presently a blosely covered vehicle, drawn by one horse, ap. peared coming from the main road, and approaching the door. The next moment, the officer, whom we have already noted, en- tered the house, and told Miss Haviland she was required to depart.     ^ "This young lady attends me, if I am compelled to go, sir," said Sabrey, firmly, pointing to Vine, who instantly advanced and locked her arm within that of the former, by way of confirm. ing the assertion. Such are not my orders," responded the officer, with an air Of slight perplexity. "Then I go not with you alive, sir," said Miss Haviland, with calm determination. "Nor will I be separated from her, by you, while / am living," added Vine, with no less spirit. "Well, well, ladies, you must have your own way, I suppose. but be prompt; the carriage waits for you," replied the officer, tepping back to the door. In a few minutes more, the ladies presented themselves at the oor, and, without accepting the offered assistance of their sum. toner, entered the unoccupied vehicle, which was now immedi. ely put in motion, and conducted on in the rear of the main lumn of the tories, who had already commenced their march wards the great road. As they emerged from the short piece forest through which their way now led, the exciting spe - cle of a large body of troops, moving in military array along  a road, accompanied by the humn of mingling voices, the steady Lmp of ien and horses, the rattling of tumbrels, and the heavy Mbling of artillery, unexpectedly burst upon the senses of tile rtled maidens. Baum's select and finely-equipped rgiment Germans and British occupied the front, and Peter's motley 'ps of tories and Indians the rear of the long-extended col- n. As the head of the detachment in possession of the fair goners reached the road, they came' to a halt; when, after ting till the corps to which they belonged 'had mostly passed they, to the agreeable disappointment of the girls, turned in, moved on with the rest towards that little anticipated scene efeat and death from which so few of them were destined to By this time," observed Vine to her thoughtful companion, :they had concluded the remarks which the novelty of their tion naturally elicited , , by this time, Bart, at the rate lie ,Jt   will be likely to ride, has nearly reached Bennington, now less than ten miles distant; and in another hour after, if the news he carries has the effect on our army there that I anticipate from what I learned when I came down, these fellows will be met on the way by a force which they cannot be expecting to see. 'Can they, do you suppose?" "I think not," replied Sabrey, " or we should have been sent back, at once, to the British camp, as we expected; but, believing he shall meet with no serious opposition, and probably fearingI should find some means to escape, if sent back, my magnani- mous persecutor concludes to drag me round with him and his minions, that I may be watched more closely, till, having com- pleted his anticipated triumphs, he is ready to return." "But where is Peters?" asked the other; "where is that remarkable gentleman now, that he don't present himself here, to pay his respects, or make his apologies, or assure you of your safety, or frame some story by the way of accounting for his conduct, or, at least, of smoothing the matter? One would sup- pose the fellow would want to say something on the occasion." ("Yes," replied the former; " but he wishes to see me as little as I do him, I presume. Should he find it impossible to avoid me, however, he would probably come up boldly, and say my detention was a mistake of his subaltern; 'or that he only directed it to afford me a safe escort to my friends 'in the Grants." "There would be a deal of love in such doings." "He entertains none; not one particle now, if he ever did, for me, Vine." "What the deuse, then, does he want with you?" "Indeed, I hardly know myself." "Marry you?" "If he does still aim at that, it, is with no honorable motives. I have had some strange suspicions, lately, and I feel but too thankful at this prospect of a battle, for I shall cheerfully meet all dangers I may encounter from the flying bullets of our people, for my chance of a release."     "Chance, Sabrey? W1y, I know our side will get the vie- tory, when we shall be mede prisoners to-well, to about ,the right sort of fellows, probably," added the girl, with a merry laugh. The conversation was here interrupted by the scattering reports of musketry somewhere in front, which instantly threw the whole  line into commotion. An immediate halt was commanded, and     the troops hastily formed it order of battle, as well as the ground  I-"             s   132          THE BANGERS, w ould permit, Glancing over the line in front, from the small elevation on which they chanced to have stopped, the girls per. ceived that the head of the column had reached the banks of the Stream that here crossed the road, and were rapidly deploying into the fields, to the right and left, to be prepared to receive their yet invisible foe. The bridge over the stream had just been torn up, and its scattered wrecks were seen floating down the stream below. While Baum was hurrying forward his artillery to the. front, a body of about two' hundred Americans emerged from their coverts in the bushes, some distance from the opposite bank, and, with an ominous shout of defiance, discharged their guns, and disappeared over the hill beyond, before the slow Germans, who alone were yet near enough to do any execution with mus- kets, were ready to return a single shot. A strong guard of pickets, consisting of tories and Indians, were now sent forward to ford the stream, and keep watch of their retreating assailants, while the few wounded and dying wretches who had experienced the effects of American marksmanship were carried back on hastily-constructed litters to a house in the rear, affording the shocked maidens, as they were borne by groaning and writhing in their agony, a sad and sickening foretaste of the fearful scene of blood and carnage they were destined soon to witness. As soon as the bridge was repaired by the engineers, who were occupied nearly two hours in rendering it passable, the column was put in motion, and again moved forward, but much slower and more cautiously than before ; for there was something in the manner of this attack, as unimportant as it was, and even in the shouts of their assailants, that had disturbed the minds, and cast a visible shade of thoughtfulness over the countenances, of these hitherto self-confident and boastful invaders of the Green Moun- tains.' For the next three or four miles, however, they moved on Insmolested; when, coming to, a'hamlet of log-houses,scattered along the highway on both sides of the stream, that, here again crossing the road, wound throdgh a smooth meadow of consid- erable extent, the word Halt! halt! rang loudly, and from com- pany to company, through the line, with an emphasis and sig- nificance that instantly apprised all that trouble was at hand. The next moment all were in commotion, hurry, and alarm. Amidst the furious beating of the rallying drums, and the min. gling clamor of dictating voices, the cannon were detached from the. horses, run forward, and unlimbered; the fences on each side of the road were levelled to the ground, and the whole force rap; idly thrown into battle, array, the tories taking position in the   TE OR  THA'S DA  UGOHTER. me  adow on the right, and the regulars on the m  ore elevated grounds  to the left of the road , there to await the foeunderstood to be approaching in unexpected strength just beyond the thick cpse which terminated the opening o theeast Whie thiswas trandspir ing, the officer wh o had before taken charg e of M iss Haviland and her friend came forward, and, summoning the    from their car riage, hurried them to a large, strongly-built log-hu,  which a company of  tories had been  posted, when bidding them enter and take care of hemselves, he hastened back to his pOSt, enter and take care f         t.

THE house, into which our heroine and her attendant had been ushered for safe keeping during the expected conflict, was divided into two compartments, and separately occupied bya couple of young farmers, and their still more youthful and recently espoused wives, twin sisters, by the names of Mary and Martha. But as happy a social circle as these close and interesting ties should have continued to render the inmates, the fiend of discord, with the approach of the opposing armies, had just entered in among them. One of the young men was a whig, and the other a tory * and the wives had very naturally adopted the predilections of theirrespective husbands. The young men had, asyet,however, taken no active part in the public quarrel; and, while the war was lat a distance, their difference of opinion had not been per- mitted very essentially to disturb their friendly intercourse. But now, as the war was brought to their door, the sight of the two hostile armies, coming together for deadly conflict on the great issue in which their hitherto repressed sympathies were oppo- sitely enlisted, had aroused thie demon of contention in their friendly bosoms. The boastful assumptions of the tory, uttered in his excitement at beholding the imposing display of the British forces around him, were promptly met by the counter predictions of the other. Retort, recrimination, and darkly-hinted menaces followed, till jealousy and rancor seemed completely to have usurped the place of all those fraternal feelings that lately blessed their peaceful abode. Such was the painful and ill-omened scene which was passing in the apartment of the brother who had espoused the cause of his country, where both families were assembled to witness the anticipated battle, when the unexpected entrance of the girls put an  end to the altercation ; and it soon after being announced that the Americans had retreated, the tory, followed by his wife; retired,   with an exulting sneer, to his own room, leaving the fair stran. gers, as it happily chanced, to the care and more congenial com- panionship of the young patriot and his warmly sympathizing Martha, who now kindly supplied their wants, and then conducted them to their attic chamber, where, it being now nearly dark, they immediately betook themselves to their homely but grateful couch. And, overcome by the fatigues and harrowing anxieties of the day, they soon fell asleep, expecting to be roused in the morning by the din of the battle, which they felt confident was yet to take place before the invaderslwould be permitted to ad- vance farther on their boasted mission of plunder and outrage.  But the next day was to be marked by the battle of the ele. ments, rather than of men. The morning was ushered in by a storm of unusual violence. And as the day advanced, so seemed to increase the power of the tempest. The black, flying clouds, deeply enshrouding the mountain tops, and dragging the summits of the low, woody hills around, closer and closer begirt the dark- ened earth. Heavier and heavier dashed the deluging torrents against the smitten herbage of the field, and the trembling habita- tions of men; and louder and louder roared the wind, as- it went howling and raging over the vexed wilderness, as if in mockery of the intended conflict of the feeble creatures of earth, who now stood shrinking and shivering in its rain-freighted blasts. Miss Haviland and her friend, in the mean time, closely kept- their little chamber; and as little enviable as were their sensations under the terrors which the tempest, as it roared around the rocked dwelling, naturally inspired, it was soon with feelings of thankfulness that they found themselves permitted to remain even there unmolested ; for their ears were continually shocked, and : their liveliest apprehensions often excited, by the profane vocifer-  ations, the noisy ribaldry, and lawless conduct of the tories, who, driven from their drenched tents, which afforded them but a feeble protection against the fury of the storm, had crowded into the : i lower rooms of the house, where, half stifled,! and jostled -for want of space, they, filled up the stairway, and repeatedly at- tempted to force open the fastened door of the trembling inmates ' : of the apartment above. But the latter were at length permitted  to experience a temporary relief from this source of annoyance and apprehension. Towards night the tempest lulled, and the rain abated, when the tories left the house, and joined in the uni  versal rejoicing of the troops of the encampment, that the dis- A comforts and Isufferings of the storm were over. It soon becaim e  manifest, however, that they had been relieved of one evil only 1 O   'to be disturbed by another. In a short time, the Americanscout. m g parties- began to show themselves on- the border of the field, in various directions around the encampment. Presently, the sharp crack of the rifle, followed by the'whistling of bullets and the fall of one of their number, in the midst of the startled carnp, apprised them of the danger of remaining longer inactive, And Baumi astonished at the temerity of his foes, and scarcely less so at their evident ability to do execution with small arms at such a distance, instantly issued orders to fit out parties of taries and Indians, to go -and dislodge them. At this juncture, the girls received a visit from their friendly hostess, who, with a troubled look, entered their room, and, after telling them that she and her sister had been, like themselves, little else than prisoners in the other chamber, proceeded to0inform them that her husband, im- pressed with a sense of duty to his country, had secretly stolen off, during the preceding night, to the American camp and that Tl g nig          nip and that his tory brother-inlaw, from whom she had contrived to conceal her husband's absence through the morning, had just discovered thefact, and, with bitter imprecations, seized his gun and rushed out to join the parties fitting out to fight his countrymen. Scarcely waiting to finish her hurried communication, the agitated woman hurried down and joined her no less excited sister in the yard, to witness the expected encounter of the opposing skirmishers; while Sabrey and Vine, sharing with the sisters, though less keenly, perhaps, in the interest of the event, took post at their window, which commanded a clear view of the scene of action and looked forth for the same purpose. -  A company of tories were cautiously stealing along a low, bushy vale, towards the most westerly of the opposite woody points, from which the firing had proceeded. On the extreme right of the field, under a clump of tall evergreens, was seen the encampment of the Indians, who were in lively commotion, and evidently preparing to join in the meditated sally. One, whose stature, accoutrements, and bearing denoted him to be a chief and principal leader of the band, appeared to be actively engaged in giving orders, and pointing out the course to be taken to reach some designated station in the woods. But just as the whole party were beginning to file away in their usual fashion, their steps were suddenly arrested by a rapid discharge of rifle-shots, that burst upon them from behind an old bush fence on the bor- der of the forest, about a hundred yards to the east; when the tall chief, and three or four of his followers, in different parts of their line, were seen leaping wildly into the air, and then pitching   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       LO' headlong to- the-earth, to rise no more. The next instant, every' dark form had vanished, and their places of refuge were only disi',. tinguishable by the occasional reports of their- guns, as the -pro-,. tracted skirmish gradually receded within the depths of the forest. Meanwhile, the tories had proceeded on their destination undis, covered, till they reached the termination of their'screening ridge on the left, which brought them within fifty yards of the bushy- point where the largest party of their opponents lay concealed;- unsuspicious of any immediate attack. Here the former made -a brief pause, when they rushed forward with a loud shout, and, after a rapid exchange of shots, and a brief hand to hand con- flict, drove the others from their ground, and compelled them to. flee across the intervening opening to the opposite jungle, for- protection. A cry ot exultation now burst from the lips of the wife of the tory, as she witnessed this successful onset of her husband's party, and, crowing over her disappointed sister; she began to treat the insignificant result as the certain precursor of, the speedy flight of the whole rebel army. But her triumph was of short duration; for, almost the next moment,'the discomfited. party, in conjunction with the band of their associates, to whose covert they had retreated, sallied out, and, returning impetuously. to the charge, sent a fatal shower of bullets into the huddled ranks) of the unprepared tories, and soon routed them entirely from the woods, from which they were seen flying, -in wild dis;- order, towards the encampment. The rallying wife of the whig now, in turn, broke out in retaliatory exclamations of joy and; ex- ultation. But her triumphs, also, were destined to be cut short as speedily as those of her equally thoughtless sister, but in a dif- ferent, and far more sorrowful manner. A man, bearing the lifeless body of one- of the slain on his shoulders, now emerged into view, and came hurriedly stagger-: ing along over the field, directly towards the house. The instant thb careless eye of the elated Martha fell on the approaching figure, it became fixed as if enchained by a spell. The half- uttered word she was speaking suddenly died on her faltering tongue. An instinctive shudder seemed to run over her; and, for nearly a minute, she stood gazing in motionless-silence. "What is that? O! what is that?" at length burst sharply from her blanched lips. But no one answered; and she again relapsed into the same ominous silence, and continued gazing with the same burning intensity, till the man, witth a look of conscience-smitten, agEny, came up, and laying down his burden on the grass, gently turned 12*   it- over, and presented to her the face of her slain husband ;:,when shriek after shriek broke, in quick and startling succession, from her convulsed bosom, and she was carried, in a state of wild- and fearful frenzy, into the house. The homicide was the tor husband, who, having met his victim in the fight, and acting, aso he averred, under an irresistible impulse, had, singled -out. and, slain one, whom, the next moment, he would have given worlds to: have been able to bring to life.* The scattered forces of the sky now again began to collect, the rain to descend, and the angry winds to roar through the sur- rounding forest, compelling both the assailed and assailants to.  retire from the fields and woods to their respective-.places of ren-. dezvous for shelter. And soon night closed over the scene, and shrouded every object from view with its Egyptian darkness. Widely different were the feelings and impressions which the, events of that afternoon had imparted to the troops of the two opposing armies.  The advantages gained, though not very im- portant or decisive, had yet been almost wholly on the side of the Americans.  Their different parties of scouts and skirmishers, who, with the first slackening of the storm, had filled the woods in every direction around the British encampment, had slain or disabled, in the various encounters of the day, more than thirty of, their opponents, and, among them, two Indian chiefs, whose destruction caused a rejoicing proportioned to the exasperation which their presence here had occasioned.  And the effect of the whole had been to banish the last remaining doubts of success from their bosoms, and make them long for the hour when they should be permitted to meet the foe in regular battle. The losses and defeats of the royal forces, on the other hand, had proportionally depressed their feelings, and filled them with dark forebodings of the fate which was. in store for the. Nor did these feelings, in conjunction with the natural effect of the gloom, and physical discomforts of their situation, long fail of a charac- teristic manifestation among the contrasted ba nds of that fated r army. And strange and fearful were the sights and sounds which their encampment exhibited during the night of storm! and dark" ness that followed.

But what, in the nmean while, were the thoughts and sensations' of the hapless maiden, whose fate and fortune seemed to have become so strangely involved in the movements and scenes: we 'have been describing? To her the day had been but a varying scene of gloom and wretchedness -of maidenly terror and pain- ful excitement. And night had come only to be made still more hideous by its accum llated horrors. Shuddering at the stjnge and appalling sounds, that constantly assailed her recoiling senses from without, and pained and distressed at the ceaseless wail- ing of the bereaved a;d heart-broken wife within- often startled and alarmed at the n)isy intrusions of the heartless tories in, the room below, and their frequent threats, and even occasional: at- tempts to get into her apartment above, and tortured by the anxi- eties, suspense, and apprehension she felt respecting the fate for which she might be reserved, independent of the more immedi- ately-menaced evils around her, she lay, hour after hour, during the first watches of tlat fearful night, tremblingly clinging to: her less-troubled compan on, and earnestly praying for death, or the. approach of moinin , to relieve her from some of the Iorrors of her situation. But at length her exhausted system yielded:to the requirements of inature, and her senses became loked, a nd her cares lost, in the forgetfulness of slumber. She and her atte dant were awakened, the next morning, by the reveille of the clangorous brass drums of the Hessians, and the mingling hum of the stirring camp around them. Attiring themselves with that haste which, whether required or not, is usu- ally consequent on a state of great anxiety, they ran to the win- dow and glanced o t over the landscape. But what a contrast with what it yesterday presented! The black storm-cloud, that had so. closely brobde -over the earth, had been rolled away, and the cerulean vault above was as calm and cloudless as if storm aid I .^   tempest had never disfigured its beautiful expanse. The air was full-of balmy sweetness; and soon the golden sun, owly mount ing over the eastern hills, poured down his floods light upon the varigated landscape, transforming the still-weepig forest into a sea of glittering diamonds, converting the hithero unnoticed openings on the surrounding hill-sides into brightspots of smiling verdure, and adding a brighter tint to the yellow fields of waving grain, that stood ripening in the valley, soon to be trod and tram- pled by other than peaceful reapers' feet: - q "For here, far other harvest here Than that which peasant's scythe demands, Was gathered il by sterner hands, With musket, blade, and spear." Slowly rolled the bright hours of that calm and beautiful morn. ing away, as Miss Haviland, with her attendant, sat by the win- dow, often and axiously glancing along the road to the east, to catch" a glimpse of that army, in whose movements all her hopes were centred, making its expected advance. But it came not. . No  American-not even a  scout or skirmisher--any where made his appearance; and no signs of a battle were visible in any quarter, unless they might be gathered from the busy labors stlheritish troops in putting their arms in order, or the unusual stiness and the air of anxious suspense that seemed to pervade their whole' encampment. Noon came; and still all remained quiet as before. That hour, and the next, also, passed away with the same ominous stillness; and the desponding girl began seri-  usly to fear, that the Americans had indeed retreated from the vicinity, and left her and the country alike at the mercy of the foe. But Just as this depressing thought was taking possession of her minmdi a sound reached her ears from afar, that caused her suddenly to start to her feet with a look of joy and animation that, 'or weeks, had been a stranger to her countenance. ,       ,     CHAPTER XIII.     -   -  '"Death to him who forges , Fetters, fetters for the free I - Eastman,  : "DID you hear that?" exclaimed the maiden, with flushed cheek and kindling eye. "Hear what?" asked her surprised and wondering com- panion, who had heard nothing to warrant so sudden a change in the others demeanor. "That sound from the forest yonder," answered Sabrey,-   ' pointing over to the wood bordering the opening to the south. "But hush! listen! it may be repeated. There-didn't you hear it then?"  "I heard nothing but the hooting of an old owl over there.

They did so; and presently the same slow, solemn hoot d-of  the bird just named rose more loud and distinct than before; And scarcely had the last sound died away in its peculiar  melancholy cadence, when th6 solitary report of a musket sent its echoing peal over the valley from the forest in the opt posite direction.

The admirable imitation we have just heard was doubty , less given by him who communicated to me this fact, and. gave me a specimen of his faculty of making the sound as we were coming through the woods in our recent flight. It here shows, uwn- less I greatly err, that his regiment is passing round to the rear of the enemy; while the gun we 'have just heard must proceed, I think, from some other force going round through the woods on the opposite side, -these sounds being a concerted interchange- f  , signals to apprise each other and General Stark of the progress : they have made towards the appointed station.

Then, Vine, then comes the struggle we have been praying to witness. O, may Heaven prosper the defenders of their homes, and enable them to triumph over their haughty foes." The conjectures of Miss Haviland respecting the plan of attack which the Americans had adopted were well founded. Colonel Herrick, with his brave and spirited regiment of Rangers, had been despatched through the woods to the rear of the enemy, where he was to be joined by nearly an equa. force of militia, under the command of Colonel Nichols, coming Ithrough the forest, also, in an opposite direction; while the remaining and larger portion of the army was to advance in front, in time to commence with the former the general attack. And, in a I short time, the long, deep roll of drums, swelling louder and louder on the breeze, an- nounced that Stark, with the main body, was in motion, and rapidly approaching along the road from the east. l Quickly every part of the British camp was in lively commo- tion. And the hasty mounting of field-officers, the flying of the scattered troops to their respective standards, the furious beating of the drums to arms, and the deep, stern words of colnmand, mingling with the rattling of steel, and other sounds of hostile preparation, all plainly told that they were at length aroused to the conviction that their opponents in front were coming down in full force upon their encampment; and that something more might now be required to insure their safety, than the empty vaunting, and the supposed intimidating display, of British uni- forms and brass cannon, which had thus far marked the expedi- tion, and constituted its only achievements. And scarcely had the different divisions of their motley army become arrayed and fixed in their line of battle, which consisted of the regulars within their strong field-works on the elevated plain on the left, and the Canadians and tories behind their more imperfect de- fences stretching from the former across the meadow on the right --scarcely had this been done, before their line of pickets, which had been placed among the trees at the eastern termination of the field, suddenly broke from their station, and came disorderly rushing-back to the encampment. Presently a dark body of men in motion began to be perceptible thfough the openings of the wood along the line of the winding road; and, in a moment more, Stark's noble little brigade of sturdy and resolute peasant warriors came pouring into the field. Wheeling in beautiful order into battle array, they came to a halt in the open plain near the border of the woods. Stark, then   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       143 I   advancing, rode slowly along the front of the line, and, at length pausing, ran his practised eye collectedly over the firmly-standing ranks and dauntless faces before him; when, raising his massive form to its full length, he raised his glittering sword, and pointed to the hostile lines. "Yonder, my men," he said, in a voice whose clear, deep, and ringing tone, in the stillness which at the moment prevailed, dis- tinctly reached the attent organs of our fair listeners --" yonder, my brave rmen, stand the red-coats, your own and your coun- try's foe --their army a mongrel crew of Hessian hirelings, fighting for eight-pence a day, or thereabouts; of tories, who come to ravage and enslave the land that gave them birth ; and lastly, of Indians, dreaming of scalps and plunder! Are you not better men? Have you not nobler objects? Call you not your, selves freemen, with hearts to defend your homes and country,? If so, then jIt your deeds this day prove it to the world! As for myself, my esolution is taken, - the field and foe is ours by set of sun, or Molly Stark this night will sleep a widow."'  Three hearty cheers, bursting spontaneously from the listening ranks before him, told the gratified leader that he had not over- rated the spirit and enthusiasm of the men to whom his brief but effective appeal had been addressed. The British forces, in the mean time, awaited the approach of their opponents in silence. Baum even forebore to open upon them with his cannon, in the delusive hope that they would prove to be one of the large bodies of friendly inhabitants, who, he had been assured, would rise up in arms to join his standard as he advanced inlo the interior. His suspense, however, was soon- ended. A scattering volley of musketry, followed by a distant shout, rose from the woods in rear of the station occupied by the Indians. Ard suddenly the whole body of the savages, contrary to their usual custom, quitted the woods, and came rushing into the camp oft their allies with manifestations-of the greatest sur- prise and disimay. The next moment, Herrick, at the head of his long files of Rangers, emerged into the open field, rapidly formed them into co umn, and advanced towards the rear of the enemy's intrenchmentsi while, at the same time, Nichols and his corps were seen approaching from the forest in an opposite direction, to form the contemplated junction, and move on with the former to the combined assault. The moment the Indians obtained a view of both these forces, and perceived they were converging to- gether so as to form a continuous line of battle along the rear, they began to manifest the greatest uneasiness and alarm. And   their innate dread of being surrounded soon becoming too strong for the, restraints of discipline, they broke from their position, and, likea flock of wild horses, commenced a tumultuous flight across the field towards the woods in open space between the two ap. proaching forces of their opponents, who, quickly changing fronts, poured in upon them  a rapid succession of destructive volleys. A fierce shout noT burst from the ranks of the assail. ants; and, when the smoke rose, a line of dark, lifeless forms marked the green field nearly to the woods; others were seen crawling, like wounded reptiles, to the nearest coverts; while all the rest of the savage foe had disappeared forever from the field. Herrick and Nichol having now resumed their march, and Stark put his corps in motion, the three divisions, with two small flanking detachments, despatched along the woods to the right and left of the main body, all moved steadily on to the different. points of attack. I They were not permitted, however, to advance far unmolested; for suddenly every part of the royal lines became wrapped in clouds of mingling smoke and flame; while the heavens anid earth seemed rent by the deaif ening crash of exploding muskets, and the jarring concussions ofrcannon, which instantly followed. Unmoved, however, by the tremendous outhreak, the American forces all moved steadily and rapidly forward till the forms of their opponents could be discerned beneath the lifting smoke, when they poured in a storm of fire and lead- which told with deadful effect on the shrinking lines before them. The general fire thus fatally de. livered was speedily returned; and the battle now commencing in fearful earnest in every pat of the field, both armies became so deeply concealed in the whirling clouds of smoke, which enveloped them, that the opposing forces could be distin- guished  only in the fierce gl ams of musketry and the broader blaze of cannon that burst ineessantly along the lines, filling, with the mingled uproar of a  thousand thunders, the-rocking valley and reverberating nmourtains around. In the mean while, our hero'.ne and her companion, who, at the first shock of this terrible onset, had shrunk back in consterna- tion from view of the scene sgt listening on their humble couch to the fearful din that assailed their recoiling senses in every r direction around them from without, with feelings which can be far more easily imagined tha n  described. For more than an hour, while the battle continued to rage with increasing violence, and showers of bullets were  eard every moment striking and burying themselves in the logs omposing the walls of their seemr . t^^^^^^                    .

But Sabrey's increasing anxiety for the result, at length, mastering all- other considera- tions, she arose, and, against the remonstrances: of her compan- ion, advanced towards the window. "How awful!" she exclaimed, as she glanced: out on the terrific conflict. "Too awful to witness, unless; ithere were some- use,in so do. ings" responded Vine. "If we vrere permitted to mingle inl the- fight with our friends, I, for one, would be willing to bravea all. the horrors of the battle for the. good I might- do; but;, as this cannot be, why should we expose ourselves to danger so useless- ly.? Now, I do entreat yor, Sabrey, to venture no farther, she continued," as the former, reaching the window, leaned forward, for a full view of the scene. '"Step back' from that dangerous, spot; don't you hear the bullets rattling, like hail, round, the: building:?" ' Yes, but there is no danger where I stand, I presume; but' if there were, I could no longer forbear watching the issue:of' a contest: in which my own fate, as well as that of friends; is so- deeply- involved," replied Sabrey, with desperate calmness,. as' she! continued to rivet, her gaze or- the field below. "If you will look, then," said the other, "tell me what':you. see going on." "I, will," answered the former, i as far; as I can distinguishiany movements. But, at present, both sides are, so completely cono, cealed in the -smoke that enshrouds them, that I can only diseernt dark: forms in active, motion along the lines, as the blaze-of:their fire-arms reveals portions of their ranks.  The struggle, howevers- is evidently a dreadful one! In that continued, deafening crash which: you hear, flames and smoke seem to be vomited forth from the earth, as if from the mouth of a volcano." ' There seems to be less firin g now," observed Vine, after' listkning in silence a few minutes. ' Can you perceive any new movements afoot?, Can't you distinguish any of the words of' cormmand, or any thing that is saii among that uproar of voices, which, between the booming of, the cannon, once in a, wmhilei, plainly reaches my ears?"

How mightily he cries to Heaven for succor and sucdess!" "Where is he? among the rest in the fight?" "No, not directly in the battle, I should think, but a little aloof, in the rear of this end of the American lines. There! I can now distinguish his form coming obliquely out of the smoke in this direction." "Who is he?" "I know not; but he seems a venerable old man, and his long, white locks are streaming inr the wind, as, with a grasped musket in his hands, and the cry of The sword of the Lord and Gideon on his lips, he rushes towards the foe." "What! to encounter them alone?" "Yes, alone, and in advance of all others. Now he takes his stand in front of a group of tories partially concealed by the bushes on the bank of the stream. There! he raises his gun, and crying, God have mercy on your soul, fires, and his victim pitches headlong to the ground. They return his fire, but harm him not; and he again raises his gun, and, with the same prayer for mercy on the soul of the foeman he has singled out, fires, and another tory falls heavily to the earth. Mercy! they are now rushing forward to slay the old man! But now they are met by a party of the Americans, running forward with shouts, For the rescue of Father Herriot! Both sides fire; and again all are enveloped in the cloud of smoke that rolls over them." "Father Herriot--Father Herriot," said Vine, musingly. "I have heard a great deal said about one they call Father Herriot, lately; but can he be here fighting?"  Why, who and what is he, that he should not be here?" asked the other. "A sort of preacher, I believe," answered Vine, "but rich enough to have bought several large tory estates; though where he came from, or how he got so much hard money as he seems to have, nobody can tell." A fresh and general outhreak between the opposing lines here interrupted the conversation, and turned Sabrey's attention again to the field. And for nearly another fearful hour did she keep her stand at the window, heedless of the danger from the bullets which were whistling round her head, and unable, in the ago- nizing anxiety she felt for the result, to withdraw her eyes from that dread field, where the-- continued thunders of the artillery    OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER. AO aid musketry, shaking the solid earth along the line of conflict, p claimed the battle to be still raging with unabated fury. iAt length, a brisk breeze sprang up in the north-west, and the battle cloud rolled heavily away before it from the field, dis- clsing, not only the relative positions of the opposing forces, but tha awful picture of carnage that every where strewed the black- e ed earth. Mutually anxious to avail themselves of this oppor trnity to ascertain each other's situation, both parties at once s spended operations, for the purpose of obtaining observations }ich should enable them to resume the battle with more deadly elect. The deafening roar of musketry which, for nearly two hburs, had shaken the embattled plain like one continued peal of t under, was now heard rolling away, in dying echoes, among the far-off hills, leaving only the monotonous din :of the martial music, kept up to drown the criis of the wounded, and the heavy b orhing of Baum's artillery, that still maintained its regular fi e ton the hill, though only to send - as it now became evident it had done from the first- its iron missiles high and harmlessly o0rer the heads of the Americans, into the tops of the crashing frest beyond. "Is the battle over?" askel Vine, as the noise of fire-arms tus subsided.

"Ay, and lho knowsbut I,might be heard,:or, at least, understood: , she added, glancing hurriedly though thewindowto the. grounds round the house, to see :what might be there to prevent 'herfrom trying to put her half:formed resolution into execution. In looking out, with -this;object,her eye :fell on the rude portico running along thatside of the house,-the narrow, flat roof of which rose within a!few:feet of her window. And, suddenly changing:her purpose, she hastily tore out the fastenings-of the window, removed the sashes,and leaped down to the roof of the portico, and stood in open-vie w:of the greaterpartion;ofbotharmies. Butstillregardless of her exposure, sheadvanced to the verge of the roof, and, turning towards the mericans, waved high her kerchief, and essayed to lift her voice over the tumult, in words which, she hoped, would catch their attention and arrest their supposed flight. But the Americans, -who had only fallen back a short distance to avoid the now :unobstructed aim of :the enemy, and prepare for a fresh onset, had already come to a stand, but were at first too busily engaged in loading their guns, and ywatching the motions of their foes, to observe her. The tories, however, whose forces were posted in-the -more immediatevicinity, instantly noted her appearance, and pointed her out to; their officers, who, at once, appeared to read her intentions. And the next moment Colonel Peters, now for the first time :presenting himself to her sight since her recap his opponents. Stung by this public exhibition of her disdan, and defiance ,of his commands, the tory chief hastily raised a pistol towards her, and, in a fierce and menacing tone, demanded an immediate compliance with his orders. ;',God have ,mercy on your soul!"'was at that instant heard issuing-from a covert near the American lines, in the well-known vdice of 'Father Herriot.

But although the maiden had failed at the onset to attract the at en ion of the Americans by her attempt, as she had designed, yit tl te incident, to which the bold step she had taken gave rise, re effectually subserved her purpose. The firing had at once dwwa all eyes to the spot. Presently the low hum of questioning voices was heard running through the American lines, while many ai u? lifted ihand was seen pointing to her conspicuous form, as, stIl indete'red from her purpose, she stood waving her signal kerchtief towards them. And the next moment the loud and cheer- ing cry, Forward, to the rescue of the Tory's Daughter-! burst from the Rangers, and was speedily caught up and echoed in lively acclamations, from detachment to detachment, through the whol encircling lines of the assailing army, which, with one im- pulse, now threw itself forward towards the foe. And, unmoved by the tremendous but hasty and misdirected fire that every where met them on the way, they swept onward like an avalanche to the vrery fobt of the tory intrenchments; when, pausing only to pour in th ir devouring volleys, they mounted the works, and, raising their clubbed muskets, dashed down, with shouts of defi- ance upon the recoiling ranks of the amazed and panic-stricken foe, who, uinable to withstand the force and fury of the onset, instatly gave way and threw down their arms, or scattered and fled in every direction. A tonished and alarmed at beholding all his outworks so sud- denlyr  and unexpectedly stormed and carried, Baum seem ed immpdiately to have resolved on a desperate effort to retrieve the fortunes of the day. And in a few minutes he was seen at the head of a long column of his grenadiers, issuing from his intrench. men s on the hill, and bearing down with hasty step on the assail- ing forces ielow. But the next moment, that imposing column, with its luc'kless leader, disappeared before the enfilading fire of the death-dealing Rangers, like frost-work before the breath of a furnace; while, nearly at the same time, an upleaping cloud of smoke and I ame, followed by the shock of an exploding ammunition wagon within the principal works, completed the only signal of encouragenent that was wanted by the already flushed assailants to decide them on lan immediate attempt for the completion of their triumph. And before the dull roar of the explosion was lost 13'" 1   *  t   TIE!!tAWGERS, *.   ;among the echoing hills, the deep-toned *oiee of the intrepid :tark, ever eagle-eyed to see, and prompt to seize, an advantage was heard rising over the tumult, in ordering the final assault which, having leaped from Ihis horse, and sprung forward to the head of a forming column, he was the next moment seen, with the air of a roused lion, leading on in person. Inone minute more all the various forces, not required to guard the prisoners .lread taken, were in motion, and, with flashing eyes and rapid, deter- mined tread, charging up the ascending grounds towards e dig ferent sides of the doomed redoubt; inm another, they were fuiously rushingomver the emsaonkments nd pouring their bristling c lumns in resistless streams down upon the weakened and dismaed forces f the Germans and British in the enclosure. Then sue eded the rapid, scattering reports of pistols and musketry, the unds of fiercely-clashing steel, and the wild cries of those strugglig hand to hand in deadly contest, and the wilder shrieks f the wounded, all rising in mingled uproar from the spot. Then all was hushed in a momentary stillness; and then rose the long, loud shoutgof a thousand uniting voices, pealing forth to the heavens the exulting acclamations of victory!

LIKE the rapidly-flitting scenes of some dibramic exhibition passed the;crowding events of the next half hour before the half. bewildered senses of our heroine. The sudden appearance of Woodburn in the now deserted yard of her prison-house, whither, the moment the battle was won, he had hastened, with the usual anxiety of the lover made intense by the distracting fear that- she might have ;been carried off by the escaping tories,- his eager Inquiries for her presence and safety,--her own involuntary but silent response to his calls, by rushing out to meet him, and placing herself under his coveted protection, - the hurried con, gratulations that passed between them,-the complimentary greetings of the gallant hero of the day, and other distinguished persons soon gathering around her and her fair companion, as they stood shrinking from the admiration and applause which the conduct of one, and the position of both, had called forth from the lips of all, -their welcome esepe from the embarrassing scene, in -a carriage, under the guidance of Bart, to whom they were given in charge by Woodburn, as he hastily departed, at the head of a chosen band of followers, in pursuit of Peters, and a body of tories that were discovered to have escaped, - the pas. sage of the vehicle through the contested field, ploughed up by artillery, blackened by the fire and smoke of battle, and strewed with the dying and the dead, among whom the busy groups of the dismissed soldiery were every where scattered in pursuit of their different objects - here to collect plunder from their slain ene- mies, and there to minister to the wounded, or search among the fallen for missing comrades, - all these followed so rapidly upon a victory, the sudden announcement of which had nearly over- powered her with joyful surprise, that it was not till she and her companion had passed beyond the confines of the battle-field, and entered upon the comparatively solitary road leading towards the village of Bennington, to which they were now directing their course, that she could realize her happy deliveranee. Then, :for the firMt time during that terrible day, the woman -in her prevailed, ,-   THE IANaGERS, and she melted into tears. But they were the tears ofoyand gratitude-that she and her native land, w ose immediate fate had So singularly become interwoven with h ownhad alike fate h ad permitted to trimph. We, must, howe r, leave her and her friend to indulge!their overflowing feeling and listen to the re. citals of the no less happy Bart, whohad eninthe hottestofthe fight, hile they pursue their unmolested way to their present destination -we must now leave them, ad return once more to the f ied of battle, where the dismissed troops were still busil engaged in gathering up the -trophies of war, preparng refresh. ments, and exulting over the- glorious resulo of the confl' dreamng of any further anear of. t e ..onfl ct, little are ming of any further appearance of the enemy after So60 signal a defeat. But hark! What means that heavy fring which suddenly comes echoing over the forest from the west? Does it portend only some skirmish on the line of the retreat, where a portion of the foe have come to a stand to shield the rest, or favor their escape  No; it is the booming of the deep-mouthed cannon, and not those of the defeated foes; for they have left al theirs behind        them y have left a-l theirs behin them. While every eye and ear, through the hushed field were turned in anxious perplexity towards the fieldnou horseman came dashing at full speed alng the wood begit road rom that direction, loudly proclaiming, as he drew near, the startling intelligence, that the broken and flying bands of the enemy had been met and rallied by a re/nforcement of five hun. dred fresh veteran troops, well supplied with artillery whole making  more formidable army than the first, and evi- dently resolved to retrieve the lost credit of the day, and rvenge two miles of the place i two m elres of ththe p lac we re rappdly a p aching, and within The next moment the loud and quickly repeated cry of "To arms to arms!" rang far and wide over the field. Then fol. lowed the rapid roll of the alarm drums, the rattling o hastily. grasped muskets, the trampling of hurrying feet, and the con- fused clamor of voices; while the scattered and c the onm bands of the surprised troops were seen throwing down theling plunder, or leavinhe h-,e    ..       g down ther plunder, or leaving the half-partaken meal, and flying, in all di    reetionsv to their respective  be ready t meet the menaced onset, and die, or keep the field they had so mlori- ously won.

OR THSE ;tOYS DAUGHTER.      8its munition, and br inggIthem into line, the British, led onbythe cool and:experienced iBreymath,and driving before them :the detach- ,ment of Americans sent in pursuit of the fugitives, came pouring into the ;field; and, immediately throwing themselves into battle array, opened a tremendous fire, with cannon. and small 'arms, upon the half-formed lines of their opponents, gathering to;dis- pute their passage in front. The Americans returned the fire, which, though partial and irregular, was yet so well directed as to put a -temporary check upon the advance of the foe. But the latter, seeing ;the unprepared condition of the former, and be- coming confident of an easy victory, were soon again upon the advance; while Stark, destroying the breastworks that had shel- tered 'the ifoe in the first action, as far as the time would permit, and --dragging the captured cannon along with him, slowly ,fell back, continuing to make his dispositions, and pour, from time ito time, as he went, 'his well-aimed volleys upon -the thinning ranks of hiis pursuers. At length, 'however, he took his stand, resolved, in ,despite of all :his disadvantages, to make a final and desperate effort to regain the lost mastery of the field.  But closer and closer pressed the exulting and determined foe; and, although well and bravely did his weakened and exhausted men repel the fierce charges of their assailants, yet it soon became evident that they could not long withstand the repeated assaults of-those heady, j    and disciplined columns upon their unequal lines. Both the men and their officers began to exchange doubtful and despairing glances; and even;ttheir bold and unyielding chief was seen to look uneasily around him. But at that critical juncture, when the fate of the 'free seemed trembling doubtfully in the balance, f i   an inspiring shout rose from the copse-wood bordering the road in E    the rear. Aid the next moment, the far-famed regiment of Green Mountain Boys, whose earlier arrival had been prevented by the storm of the preceding day, emerged into view; and, led on hby the chivalrous Warner on his fiery charger, that would know no i   other rider,* advanced with rapid and resolute tread directly to the scene of action. :"Warm work, warm work here, Colonel Warner," said Stark, as the other dashed up to his side for his orders. * It may -be interesting, to the antiquarian at least, to learn that the splendid war-horse, which Warner was known to have rode in hall is battles, could neither be mounted nor managed by any except the colonel, and his son, then a lad of sixteen or seventeen, who attended his father in the service mainly on that account. This fact I have from the lips of Colonel W.'a second son, now living in Lower Canada.   154        ' THE RANGERS, " Ay, genpral,; but we will make it still warmer for, the Aed- coats, at least, if you will give us'a chance at them in front of your line," promptly responded the gallant officer. P"That chance you shall -have, with the thanks of my exhausted tiroops, to wo-m, and myself, your presence, at this rime, my brave friend, could scarcely be more welcome," said Stark, with a frankness and'cordiality of manner which attested the pleasure he felt at the other's timely arrival. "Thank  ou- thank you, general," replied Wars er, gal- loping back to his regiment, and commanding their atten- tion.  ,Soldiers,' he exclaimed, in his clear, trumpet tones, throwing back his tall, uperb form, and displaying his noble and beauti- fully-arched brow - " my brave soldiers, shall this be our battle, and our victory?" A deafening cheer was the affirmative response. "In God's name, on, then!" he resumed, in a voice of thun- derr-" on, and avenge yourselves for country's wrongs, and for your flogging at Hubbardton." Inr eager obedience to the welcome command of their idolized leader, who now led the way, with flashing eyes and waving. sword, they all swept on through the opening ranks of their loudly-cheering companions in arms, rapidly deployed into line, and, the next instant, wrapped themselves in the flame and smoke of their own fire, which burst, with an almost single re- port, into the very faces of the astonished foe, Whose ranks went down by scores before the leaden blast of that terrible volley. And, by the time they had recovered from .the shock of the un- expected assault, the relieved and encouraged forces of Stark, now strengthened by the arrival of additional numbers of the scattered militia, and formed into new and more effective com- binations; returned with fresh ardor to the contest. And,as the Vifferent detachments, moving resolutely on, with flying colors and rattling drums, to the various points of attack assigned them in front and around the hostile squares, reached their allotted- stations, they successively poured in their withering volleys till the rebounding plain trembled and shook beneath the tumult and thunders of a conflict, to which, in obstinacy and sanguinary fierceness, few engagements on record afford a parallel. On one side was discipline, with revenge, the hope of reward, and the fear of the disgrace attending defeat, to incite them to action. On the 'other side, the stake was home and liberty; and these,   OR THE TBEr '  TOSY D DHTEB . as the trained officers of Europe soon found to theirastonishment ofenfmorethacopensate  d fr the tlack o f   p  i tary experience; f or nt ending for a stake of su indvul moment, evxp ery man i te r anks of freedom, though fr eqnt wholly u  ntrained, and in bale for the firsholt timespons hbilis f once became a war  rior, fighting as if the whol e resp nsibility  the issue of the  battle rested on his own shoulders- And, in ever part of the field, deeds were performed by nameless peao antsrivaingthe   m  ost daring exploits of heroes.

And, for this. purpose,- we will- now change the scene to a wild glen, far within the depths of the forest, where, hedged in by an impassable morass in front, and steep ledges: of rocks on either side, a gang- of a, half dozen of the fugitive tories, headed by an officer in British uniform, had turned round with the desperate ferocity of wild beasts, to give battle to the- indefatigable pursuers, who had fol. lowed them from the battle-field with a vigilance and speed from which there was! no escape, and with such demonstrations of marksmanship as had already told fatally on nearly half their numbers on the way. But those pursuers, as wary as they- were brave and untiring, with the double object of concealing the in- equality of their inumbers, which were but four, and. securing the advantages that a choices of positions in all sylvan contests especially affords, ,had instantly fallen back to a line of hastily- selected coverts, stretching across the gorge, and had now be- come wholly invisible to: their advancing foes, who soon paused in; turn,. and, shielding themselves behind the bodies ofl trees, 4     '^      OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER3    .  157 stood eagerly peering out to catch sight of the objects of theiif^am. Suddenly-the sharp report of a rifle burst from a bush-cobered cleft in the rocks nearly abreast of one of the exposed aflais of the tories; and the tallest of their number, with a, wild start, and half-uttered oath, floundered into the bushes and fell. The ne0t moment, our old acquaintance, Bart Burt, who, having conveyed the ladies to their destination, had sped back to the battle-field in time to participate in the last part of the final action, was seen stealthily creeping round the point of the ledge, from which the fatal shot had issued, and approaching the leader of the concealed assailants, who, as the reader may have6 already anticipated, was not other than Captain Woodburn. "Bart," said the latter, "you have executed my order as no other man could. But whom have you slain? Not Peters?" t No- couldn't get him in range; but did as well, though - may be better-- fixed out the only one whose aim I was 'fraid of-the big, fierce-looking whelp that shot father Herriot, in our last sally in the field; the same that made that bullet-hole in your coat on the way here; and the same, too, who would have finished me, likely, but for the glancing of his bullet on a bush before me. But I have settled all the grudges at a blow, now." "'You have done bravely; but did you discover who they are - any of them besides the leader, Peters?" "Yes, two of 'em, who are, as Dunning and Piper surmised, Dave Redding and Tiger Fitch, that beauty of a constable, who bothered us so in old times, at Guilford. He's now some kind of an officer among 'em, guess; and, dead or alive, I'm bound to have him; though, if you've any particular plan, captain, I'll follow it, instead of going round to 'tother ledge for another pick of the flock." "I have one; and that is, to draw their fire, or most of it, and then rush upon them. You may creep on, then, to Dunning and Piper, and, with them, contrive and execute some plan to effect that object, and I will stand here ready to order, and lead the' charge, at the favoring moment"  Bart now, with the noiseless tread of a cat, rapidly glided away into the bushes and disappeared on his errand. In a few minutes, the cracking of sticks, as if under the pressure of cau- tiously moving feet, was heard in a thicket of bushes within full range of the guns of the tories, who, now safely ensconced be- hind the new coverts, to which, in alarm at Bart's fatal shot, they had betaken themselves, instantly turned their attention in that, direction; and, levelling their pieces, keenly watched for the VOL. I.   14   158          THE RANGERS, expected exposure of the persons of some of their opponents. Soon, the dim outlines of two or three apparently human forms could be ' traced in the thicket, rising up one after another, with the quick,  hesitating motions of men intent on a stealthy reconnoissance of the objects before them. And, the next morrent, every tory, but ione, sent the contents of his gun at these supposed forms of the lurking besiegers. But instead of beholding, as they had an- ticipated, the riddled bodies of the dreaded foe dropping to the earth, they soon discovered, to their astonishment and dismay, that the empty coats and caps, which the outwitting Rangers had !raised on their ramrods over their prostrate persons, were the only sufferers. i '"Der-der- der-- ditter ready!" shouted Dunning, in a voice which at last went off like the terminating clap of a rattling thunder peal, as he and his two associates leaped, coatless, from fthe ground, to be prepared for the instant execution of the ex- )ected order. "On, then, and suffer not a wretch of tAem to escape you ilive!" exclaimed their impatient leader in reply, dashing foi- ward himself, and leading in the headlong onset which they all low made on the foe. i. Taken by co mplete surprise by this rapil and unexpected - novement of the assailants, now bursting upon them with cocked End levelled rifles, the dismayed tories, at first, made no at- 1empts at escape or resistance; while part of them threw down iheir half-loaded guns, and stepped out from their coverts. ': Surrender at discretion, or take the consequence!" sternly  ried Woodburn, pausing within twenty yards of the tory leader.                       i "We are in your power, sir, I suppose," replied Peters, evasively, and in a tone of affected submission, as, avoiding the burning gaze of the other, he threw a significant glance to the tory who had reserved his charge at the fruitless fire just made by the rest of his party. In an instant, the gun of the latter, who still stood behind a tree shielding him, as he supposed, from the o-her Rangers, was :levelled at Woodburn, whose attention was too intently fixed on his chief foe to notice the movement. But before the finger of t'ie assassin was permitted to tighten on the trigger, a bullet from tie unerring rifle of the watchful Dunning had pierced his brain; and his gun, as he fell over backwards, exploded harmlessly into' the air. Three of the tories, however, taking advantage of the momentary confusion occasioned by the noise and smoke of the   OR THE- TORY'S DAUGHTER.      159 guns, made a desperate spring for the surrounding thickets, and succeeded in breaking through the line of their assailants, three  of whom instantly gave chase, leaving Woodburn to cope alone with the rival foe, whom he had vainly sought through the Iday to confront in battle. Peters threw a quick, furtive glance around him; and, for an instant, seemed hesitating whether he should attempt to follow the example of the rest of his band; but an- other glance at the watchful and menacing eye of his opponent gleaming at him over the barrel of the deadly rifle, taught the folly of any such attempt, and, throwing down his, weapons, he said, -- "I yield myself a prisoner of war, sir." "A prisoner of war!" exclaimed Woodburn, repeating the words of the other, in a tone of bitter scorn. "After signifying your submission, and then instigating an attempt to shoot me, you hope to be received as a prisoner of war, do you? Villain!" he added, advancing and presenting the muzzle of his piePc  within a yard of the other's breast-" villain, your last claim to mercy is forfeited!" .... v-  "You would not slay an unarmed man, and a prisoner, would' you?" said Peters, recoiling, and casting an uneasy glance at his opponent. "Yes," replied the former, with increasing sternness, l"if, like you, in defiance of all the rules of war as well as honor, he" would do the same to me the first moment he had it in his power. No submission shields the life of an outlaw from any one disposed to take it. But you shall have one minute for uttering your last request, if you have any such to make." Being now thoroughly alarmed by the words, as well as the demeanor of his incensed captor, the once haughty loyalist fell on his knees, and humbly besought the other to spare- his life. "Live, then, wretch!" said Woodburn, at length moved to both pity and contempt by the entreaties and abject manner of. the former--" live then, i you choose it, to be dealt with as a traitor and a spy, by men who will award you your deserts with more coolness, doubtless, than I should have done, but with no less certainty." "O, spare me from that," pleaded the abased supplicant, with redoubled earnestness. "Kill me - on the spot, if you will; but spare me from that I fate. ' Allow me to be delivered up' as a prisoner of war, and I will consent to any thing--yield any thing you wish. I will insure you, by my influence at the   l160         TH-E RANGERS, British: camp, any advantage in a future exchange of prisoners youi- may-ask; and ---" 6' Peace, miserable craven!" interrupted Woodburn. I could promise you no exemption, if I would, from a punishment which our exasperated people will justly say you have brought uon your own head." - And I will also," resumed Peters, encouraged by the somewhat softened tone, and slightly hesitatirg manner of the other--"I will also relinquish all claims, and forego all inter- ference, in matters that may have stood in the way of your private interests and wishes." "I will make no pledges, nor grant, nor receive any terms, at yourdictation, sir," said the former, haughtily. "I will trust to your magnanimity to a fallen foe," then, re- joined Peters, rightly appreciating, for once, the character of his conqueror. 1"Here, take this," he continued, drawing a care- fully-preserved document from his pocket, anc extending it to- wards the other--" take it, and deliver it to the one whom it most concerns. Tell her it was voluntarily relinquished, and that I will trouble her no more." 'As small as was the measure of credit which Woodbum's judgment told him should be accorded to the motives prompting this unexpected course in his old enemy, it nevertheless quickly banished every vindictive feeling from his generous bosom; and, after a momentary hesitation, he took the proffered document, glanced at its contents, and silently deposited it among his other papers. But soon growing jealous of himself lest he should compromit the policy which his superiors might deem it just and wise, under the sanction of the stern rules of war, to enforce, he: restrained himself from making any immediate reply. And, the nest moment, he was relieved from what apparent necessity there might be for so doing, by the approach of the first of the returning Rangers* "Where is your prisoner, Piper?" he asked, turning to the latter, now coming up.      "'He would not be taken alive, sir; and the order was to let none escape in that condition," replied the broad-chested subaltern, with a significant look. "In order, then, that you go not home empty-handed," re- joined Woodburn, "I will give--you charge of my -prisoner, Colonel Peters here, whom lyou will conduct to Bennington Meeting House, whither the prisoners of the day were ordered, and where you will deliver him to. the officer in command,   OU THE TORY'?S PATGHTER.      $61! as a prisoner of war- at least for the present -for any doubts thatmay arise about his final disp6sal can be settled: here- after."               -      - - "' Der well, captain," exclaimed Dunning, whose tall, gaunt form, in the rear of his prisoner, the infamous David Redding, whom it had been his lot to capture, was now seen emerging from a thicket near by-" here is one, about whom we shan't be bothered with der doubts, a great while, if his captor can have his say." "Aha!--but what is your say about him, sergeant?" said Woodburn, smiling.        \         I "Der well," replied the other, "I say, if the ditter devil do't take him from a traitor's gallows, then we may just as well have no devil." "I shall not be the one to gainsay you in that, sergeant," responded Woodburn. "But hark! what is the uproar yonder?" he added, pointing out into the woods in a direction from whence the sound of an occasional stiff whack!/ followed by groans, cursesl and calls for protection, were nomheard to issue. On turning their eyes towards the spot, the company beheld Bart, with his rifle in one hand, and a long beechen switch in the other, driving in before him the whilom constable, Fitch, who was chafing, like a chained bear, under the lash which his catechizing captor was administering every few yards on the way. "' Why are you so rough with him, Bart?" expostulated Wood- burn, as they came up. "Well, captain, I have a reasonable wherefore for it-may be," answered the former, gravely. lc What is it?" asked the other. - "Why," replied the imperturbable Bart, " perhaps I don't re.-  member, and perhaps I do, how a chap of about my size- sat sweating near two cool hours, at the sight of an ugly-looking bunch of beech rods, that a certain constable had ordered for his back. And as 'twas no fault of his that the matter wasn't Carried out ai the time, and, as I always thought there was a mistake made as to the one whose back, ought to take it, I felt rather bound to have the order executed now, and in a manner to set all to rights between us." ("Well, well, boys," said Woodburn, with a good-humored smile, " you must all be 'indulged in your notions, I suppose, at such a glorious hour asl this. But you may now b-. moving "*  '  ^ ,          :      103          SHE T RABSts-i on with your prisoners. to the field, and thence by the road to Bennington.

So saying, he struck off rapidly from the rest, and soon disap- peared in the forest. o 41   OR THE' TORY'S D6;A-HTERB  1    65 CHAPTER XV.  "Sing it where forests wave,-- From mountain to the sea, And o'er each hero's grave, - Sing, sing, the land is free." It was evening; and all that met the eye was joy and anima. tion in the little village cf Bennington, in which, not only the great body of the opposing armies, either as conquerors or pris- oners, but the best portion of the patriotism, wisdom, and beauty of young Vermont, were now congregated There her statesmen and sages-many of whom had mingled in the strife of the day --were gathered to rejoice over a result which their own heads, and hearts, and hands, through the anxious days and nights of the preceding month, had been unceasingly engaged in securing for their country and their h)mes. There, too, the old men tnd striplings, drawn from all the neighboring settlements by the ominous sounds which had reached them from the distant battle- field, and there the maids and matrons, whose solicitude for' the near and dear ones, supposed to be engaged in the conflict,would not permit them to stay behind, were all found mingling with the victors, and participating in their exultations. Bright ights were streaming from every window, or dancing in every direction in the streets; while the smi ing faces and animated voices, every where seen and heard among the commingling throng, seeed'toe tell only of a scene of universal joy and triumph. But as -ot0l and lively as was the scene, in its predominating features; it was yet not without its painful contrasts. The broken sob, or the low wail of sorrow, was heard rising sadly on the night air, in- every interval' that occurred in the more boisterous but irrepressible manifestations which characterized the hour. And, even in the same dwellings, these two contrasted phases in war's exciting but melancholy picture were not unfrequently presented; for, while in one room might be heard the notes of joy and exal-tetioi, in another might be distinguished the stifled groan of some wounde4 soldier, or the lamentations of the bereaved over theid!dyof-a slain-relative.  Among the most noted' of the class last mentioned was the late   164          THE RANGERS, residence of Esquire Haviland, situated in the outskirts of the village, and recently occupied as the quarters of the officers of the Itangers, on the invitation of the patriotic but singular and myste- rious man, who, at its sale by the commissioners of confiscation, had purchased the establishment, among several others of a val- uable description thus sold in this section of the country. To this residence, the scene of a former portion of our story, we will now once more, and for the last time, repair. While in one part of the building the officers just named, Wvith other distinguished persons, were engaged in discussing the incidents of the day, in another and more retired apartment, on, a pillowed couch, lay the wounded Father Herriot, who, having been stricken down in the last moments of the battle, as before intimated, had S  been borne hither to complete the willing sacrifice he had made of his life to the cause of his country. On a small table, within his reach, lay several documents, which were fresh from the hand of that ready writer, the accomlplished secretary of the Council of Safety, who had just left the apartment. And around his bed stood those in whom all his private interests and sympathies had been for some time secretly concentrated, though to two of them personally unknown till a few hours before, when he had been brought in wounded and committed to their care. Those persons were Henry Woodburn, Bart Burt, Sabrey Haviland, and Vine Howard, who, ignorant of his particular wishes or intentions, and wondering why the presence of all of them should be desired at the some time, had been summoned to his bedside to hear his last communication and receive his blessing. "My prayer is answered," said Herriot, after looking ,round affectionately a while upon his expectant auditors, who, at his request, after the room was cleared of other company, had ad- vanl'lto his bedside. "My last prayer has been to be permitted to see all of you, in whose personal welfare I have been led to take a peculiar interest, assembled before me while life and rea- son remained, so that I could commune with you; and the prayer has bleen graciously answered. Still, when, at the close of our first;and, as we all then supposed, final triumph to-day, Miss Hav- iland'with her friend, at my request, was conveyed here to her formershome, of which I had become the purchaser, I then thought'to have met you all here this evening under circum- stance!s*in which I could have actively shared with you in the rejoicintl that- our victory so naturally calls forth, as well as in the happiness, which, as far as regards you, I believed I could superadd by my own acts. But He who holds the fate of indi-   OB THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.  viduals,:as well as that of armies, in his hands, has seen fit to deny me such participation ; and He doeth all things wellY. "Your wound is not necessarily a mortal one, Father Herriot; and I trust you may yet live to enjoy the fruits of a victory yout have contributed so much by your bravery to win," observed Woodburn, feelingly. i7 "That may not be.  i feel the destroyer busily at work here,: undermining the citadel," responded the other, placing his hand on that part of his chest where the bullet had entered. "But I re- gret not having made the poor sacrifice of my life for so righteous a cause. And though I shall not live to see the happiness I would be the means of imparting, yet the wish and the duty of doing what I proposed to that; end remains to be fulfilled-, and for this pur- pose I have requested your presence." The speaker here paused, as if at a loss how he should open the subject which seemed to rest on his mind. But at length he resumed: -- Miss Haviland, what you have done and suffered for the cause, in which you so nobly took your stand, is known to many. The part you have acted I in the events of this day is known to still more; but have notlthose events had a bearing on your happi- ness beyond what'would arise from the bare liberation of your person  "     . "They have, sir," replied the maiden, frankly, butwith an air of surprise at the unexpected question.    - i "And have I been correctly informed, by the person w# has just left us, and who has long been my confidential frie4i and adviser, that, by the relinquishment of a certain contract, y0 are now left free to bestow your hand on one whose character .lpd. feelings may be more congenial 'with your own? / . e," "Why am I questioned in so unusual a manner, and bJ Q much a stranger?" asked the former, in a half-remonetrat g; half-beseeching tone. I knew," rejoined the other, " that you, as twell as the rest of those present, might, at first, wonder why and how I should have kiept myself apprised, as I confess I have long done, of allthat concerned the individual interests, and even inclinations, as far as could be conjectured, of each of you. And I know, also, that my ways are not like those of other men. But cannot you trust to the motives of a dying man, and let him proceed in his own man- ner                   .,   X "'I can-I will, ather Herriot," answered Sabrey, toucheld by -the appeal. "Anld I will not affect to misunderstand you. I \   166         THE BANGERS, have been freed from fetters under which I have suffered - per haps unnecessarily-both persecution and embarrassment of feeling. And I am thankful," she continued, throwing a grateful glance to Woodburn-" greatly thankful for that generous for- bearance by which this was effected without bloodshed. Yes, I am free, doubly free; but whoever takes me," she added, slightly coloring, " must now receive, a penniless bride." "Perhaps not," said Herriot, musingly-"-- perhaps not. But I did not mean to be understood as imposing any conditions to the act I was about to perform, after ascertaining your entire deliver- ance from the power and supposed claims of one whom I deem a bad man, as well as a foe to his country. Here, deserving girl," he continued, taking up one of the documents from the table and extending it towards her, " here is a deed of gift, from me to you, of all this, which was your father's estate. Take it; it is freely given and worthily bestowed." Surprise at an act as unexpected as it was munificent, kept all mute for some seconds; when Sabrey, whose sensibilities were too deeply moved to permit her to speak, threw upon the donor a look which her grateful emotions made more eloquent than any lan- guage she could have summoned for a reply, and then, turning, she silently extended her hand to Woodburn, with the deed still lying across the open palm. "Which? - the hand or the paper?" asked the latter, in a low tone, and with a slightly apprehensive air. s& Either, or both," replied the maiden, as a blush stole over her conscious cheek. "The hand, then," exclaimed the delighted lover, grasping the coveted prize, and bearing it in triumph to his lips. "It is all right; but no words," said Herriot, making a motion for, sUce to Woodburn, who was about to, address him -" no wo   k. lhave much to say -let me proceed. Bart," he con. tinued, after a thoughtful pause, as he turned to the young man who had stood mutely noting the proceedings with a puzzled look --"Bart, do you remember the old Rose Homestead, which was confiscated, and also purchased by me?" "Well, yes," replied Bart, looking up with an inquiring, doubt- ful expression-' - yes, for as many as two several reasons, or more," he added, with one glance to Woodburn, and another, and more significant one, to Vine, who was standing demurely at his side. "Woulcd you like it for your own?" asked the former.  "My ownl'" exclaimed Bart, casting an incredulous but   I   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.      167 searching look at the other's countenance, in which, however, he read something that at once changed his demeanor; and, in a soft- ened'and respectful tone, he replied to the question, "Yes, Father Herriot, as soon as the smell of toryism got fairly out of it, I would like it grandly, that's a fact." L"It is yours, then, as this deed will show," said Herriot, hand- ing to the surprised and hesitating young man the instrument in question; "' it is yours; but have you no one to share it with you?" "Well, don't know exactly, but may be the ,chap that helped me fix up my spy disguises, and gave me so many good hints for ferreting out the tories, won't object much to that, seeing we have had considerably the startvof the captain and his lady here, in the way of finished bargains," replied Bart, turning, with an expression of droll gravity, to the blooming girl at his side, who, thereupon, with an arch and blushful smile, placed her hand in his, which had been extended to receive it. i -. "Who are you, Father Herriot?" exclaimed the now com- lletely surprised Woodburn; "who are you, to take such an interest in us, and bestow on us gifts so valuable, with so little hope, as you can have, of any adequate return?" "Listen, and you shall be answered," replied Herriot; "for the time has now arrived when you all should know the relation in which we stand to each other; and I know not but I have already delayed the disclosure of this fact too long. Perhaps I should have made it, as I had nearly done, when, at the breaking out of the war, you and Bart visited my hermit- cabin in the vicin- ity of the Connecticut. But when I found you about to embark in the cause of liberty, for which I stood ready to make any sac- rifice, I concluded to defer it, lest the discovery, which I had but then just made myself, should turn you from a serviceHatJI thought none were at liberty to withhold. I therefore, after corn, municating to you enough to lead you, in case of my death, to all the knowledge I wished you to obtain, encouraged you on your way. And it has all, doubtless, been for the best; for who knows but your individual exertions were needed to turn the scale which has been so long trembling at equipoise? But the events of this day,"s' continued the patriot, kindling at the thought ,-" the events of this day, which will be memorable through all time, have turned that scale in favor of American freedom. I riead it with a prophetic eye, which is made for me too clear for error or misconception. Our avenging armies will' henceforth go on conquering and to conquer, till the last vestige of British usurpa- tion is swept from the land."   683          TBE -RAN6ERS, Here the speaker -paused' a-while to recover from his exhaus. tion, and indulge his mental vision, apparently, with the enrap. turing glimpses he was catching of the future destiny of his coun- try. But soon arousing himself from his reverie, he resumed,- "Harry Woodburn, you had once a paternal uncle?" 4' I have been told so," was the reply. "Who, by his folly and wickedness, disgraced himself and ruined your father," proceeded the former. "I had such an uncle," responded Woodburn, with an expres- sion of gathering interest and surprise; " or, rather, I had an uncle, who, though not a bad man, was, I have understood, at one time, a very indiscreet one; and, by his indiscretion, lost his own property, and deeply involved that of my father. But I do not feel to condemn him as much as your words imply you expect I should."  "Or as; he has always condemned himself," rejoined Herriot, with an air of deep self-abasement. "But I thank God for giving me the means, and the will, for making ample restitution to such as remain of my injured brother's family, or of my own. Harry, I am that uncle. I am the erring Charles Woodburn." "I am surprised, deeply surprised," said the other; " for, at- tributing the interest you have taken in me to other causes, I have, till within a few minutes, been totally unprepared for such a revelation. And now it seems as if it could not be. You could not have much resembled my father, and you bear another name." I did not strikingly resemble my more staid brother, in per- son or character," re sponded the former, meekly; "and my rea- sons for assuming another name are explained by the circum- stances under which you first saw me, the accused of a revolting crime, of which, as I then declared, I was never guilty. And this the wicked men, who combined against me, and hunted me out, even in this new settlement, full well knew. But they knew, also, that 'I had somewhere -at -command the large amount of money that had been left me by a wealthy and heirless gentle- man, whom I had previously rescued from death. Are you now satisfied that I am the man I claim to be, and, as such, willing to acknowledge me?" "Fully, now - not only satisfied of the identity, but willing, nay, proud to acknowledge the relationship," said Woodburn, with warmth and rising emotion. "Nor is this all, my uncle, my friend! The acts you have just performed will ever ---  "Enough, enough!" interrupted the former; " but let me go on.: I have still another and more humiliating duty to perform.   OR THE.-TORY'Si DAUGHTER. o; Bart," he continued, turning, with; an agitated countenanee, toithe young man, "as forsaken and guideless as you have been, many a parent has had a less deserving offspring., And had you not done more for yourself than he, who should have been your- protector and guide, has done for you, you had been less than nothing among men. But listen; for the story of vour origin, which, thus far, has been as a sealed book to you, must now be disclosed. Your father contracted a private, but legal marriage, with a wor- man, who, as the world falsely esteemed it, was below him in station; and, in his pride, he refused to acknowledge her, and,: having squandered the property that should have been applied to her support, absconded from the country. In after years, gopw ever, conscience drove him back, but only to find her dying oft destitution and a broken heart, and to learn, from her last words that the offspring of their connection, a male infant, had been - thrown unacknowledged on, the charity. of the public. Aroused by a new sense of duty, he diligently sought for the child -fol- lowed it from, its first lodgment to its next asylum in the city; from that to, another in the country ;: and then, through vaTious shifts and wanderings, till the trace was lost far in the interior ;- when he gave up the search, and again left the country. In the process of time, he once more returned to New England, in altered circumstances, and located himself in this settlemen- where he soon met with a youth, whose countenance so strikingly: resembled that of his deceased wife, as to put him instantly on inquiry and research, which, in a few weeks, resulted in supply- ing the broken chain of evidence, and in identifying the youth as his lost son. Bart, you were, and still are, that son. I was, and still am, that father. Do I die, my much injured son, acknowl- edged and forgiven?" The young man was too deeply affected by his surprise and emotion to utter a word in--reply; but tears, which all the wrongs and hardships he had endured had failed to wring from him, now stole out on his sunburnt cheeks, testifying, not only his gratifica- tion at the discovery, but that the slumbering fountain of a nata- rally generous nature iwas now effectually stirred within his bosom. And the speaker, seeming satisfied with the answer which this evidence implied, soon proceeded :- s  "Little more now remains to be imparted. You' remember, Harry, that at the visit at my cabin, to which I have already ali luded, I showed you two small casks, labelled ' Printer's Tpe '. concealed under a stone in the cellar?" "I do; and the impression they caused of the absurdity of VOL. nI.  15 1 -     *   M 'I   170          THE RANGERS' bringing that kind of property into our new settlement," replied the other. "They were so marked for greater security," resumed the , former; " for they contained silver coin, and, at that time, nearly all the property I possessed. Of these, one has been recently appropriated to the purchase of confiscated estates, whenever a lack of money in others was likely to prevent a sale at a fair value. The other remains in the same spot. And this, and the rest of my property, except what I have just conveyed, and ex- cept, also, bequests of small farms to Dunning and Piper, for their friendship to you, and faithfulness to the cause, you will find, by my will here on the table, to be equally divided between you, my son and nephew.    And now," he added, in a faltering tone, and in accents of touching tenderness, now, m- children, having said all I wished to communicate, I will com  end you to our common Parent- above. Kneel and receive my bless- ing- '. : Hand in hand, and side by side, with the fair sharers of their gushing sympathies, the young men now reverently knelt around the dying patriot, and bowed their faces beneath his outspread hands to receive the proffered blessing, which was thenpro. nounced with much fervor, but with the last words he was des- tined ever to utter; for after waiting a while after he had ceased to speak, the tearful group gently removed his hands from their heads, and arose to be greeted by a face pale in death. t  .   OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER.       171 CONCLUSION. On/ a summer Aftenoon, nearly a year after the occurrence of the events last described, there was an unusual gathering in the village of Bennirgton. As early as one o6lock, multitudes of people were seen pouring in by every road leading into the place from the surrounding country, and filling up the streets with a promiscuous crowd of all ages, sexes, and conditions. And as the hour of two approached, the commotion increased to a degree which plainly showed that some crisis was at hand ; and soon the dense throng, gathered in the vicinity of the Green Mountain Tavern, then the principal place of public resort, broke away into groups and companies, and began to flock towards a newly- erected gallows, standing, at no great distance, on the neighbor- ing common. Here arranging themselves, as they came up, in a circle round the ill-omened structure, they assumed the attitude of spectators awaiting the advent of some promised spectacle. Presently a clamor rose from the outer part of the crowd, as, with the exclamations, "There comes the new Overseer of the Tories!" * "Tnere comes Dunning and his gang of beauties!" They pointed to a column of some dozens of variously-clad, de- jected-looking men, headed by a well-armed officer in the con- tinental uniform, just coming round a corner into view, and advancing towards the spot. "Der open there to the right and left!" cried the commander of this unique company, as he marched them up to the crowd. "Make way for Mother Britain's ditter darlings! The coming sight is as much for their der benefit as your ditter fun. There, halt!" he continued, bringing the submissive creatures into their allotted place. "Now, the first one of you that attempts to sneak away from the sight, takes a der pistol bullet. So face the music with- out flinching.: It will ditter do you good." Scarcely had this transpired before the crowd, whose attention, * The Overseer of the Tories, an officer peculiar to the times, and per- haps to the locality, was one to whom was intrusted the general sur- veillance and control of that class of persons, to prevent them from communicating with the British, and see that they did not pass over the limits of the farms, or town lines, within which, under various penalties, they were doomed to remain, unless called out by such officer for some public service, such as clearing out the highways, &c., to which theylwere held subject.   for the moment, was too much engrossed to notice the approach of the-principal procession, now close at hand, was again thrown into commotion by the sounid of a'im-fled drum, followed by the loud cry of, ".

And the other, and last of the infamous trio, now stands before us, to make atonement-for his crimes by an ignominious death on the gallows." When the speaker had concluded, the prisoner, after glancing around him, with that fitful, furtive, and restless expression, which at all times so strongly marked his countenance, turned to Ethan Allen, and meekly begged permission to address the multitude. "Why-yes," hesitatingly replied the rough old hero, who had been sitting upon his horse, moodily looking at his watch ly. ing in his broad palm, and occasionally exhibiting signs of impa- tience at -the length of his more wordy young brother's remarks - "yes, it may be right enough, that you should have your say, unless you want to preach some more of your damnable tory doctrines to the people. But be short, sir.. Your hour is nearly up; and I do not intend that the earth shall be polluted by your living presence one moment beyond the time." Immediately availing himself of this ungracious permission, the prisoner turned, shrinkingly, towards the crowd, and said,- "All you who hear me, I hope, will take warning by my miset 15 '   174    THE RANGERS, OR THE TORY'S DAUGHTER. able end -an end to which I have been brought, in my opinion, only by my inconstancy. In the first place, I adhered to my oath of allegiance, and supported the king; but, finding myself in dan- ger, I enrolled myself under the new state, and went for the authority of Congress. Conscience, however, quickly carried me back to the royal cause, which I again supported a while; and then, being over-persuaded by my neighbors, I came out once more openly for the state, and went for it till the approach of Burgoyne emboldened me to risk another change, and go for my old master. But, being soon taken in arms, I must now untimely perish. It is, therefore, my advice to you all - never fluctuate as I have done; but you who are for the States, stick by the States; and you who are for the king, stick by the king, and prove " "A nd so," fiercely interrupted old Ethan-"so you would have an interminable war, would you? Take your treason along with you to Tophet, ye doubly-damned miscreant! I will have no more of it here. Teamster, drive on the cart!" The teamster did so; and the next moment the traitor Red- ding was launched into eternity. TE END. :       , '  h            .          a 8   A LIST OF BOOKS PUBLISHED BY BENJAMN B.

By EDWARD L. WHITE and JOHN E. GOULD. This Book, in the short space of twelve months, has passed through no less than sixteen editions, and is now used in all the best Choirs and Societies in New England, and is universally considered as one of the best books of Church Music now in use. "So far as we have been able to examine this work, we should judge it to be superior to any modern work that we have seen." -Sk Democrat. "In bringing this work before the public, no time or pains have been spared to render it not only a popular, but a useful Collection. More than the isual number of new Tunes occupy a space in it, and most of this new Music is of a high character, and possesses the true attributes of Church Music. There is also to be found an unusual number of Sentence , Select Pieces, Chants, Ac., suitable for the opening and closing of divine/worship, among which the entire service of the Protestant Episcopa Church is given in the order of performance.

[Extract of a Letter from Rew M. K. Cross, of Palmer, Mass.] "I am free to acknowledge that I have been very highly gratified with the musical taste and talent exhilb!ed by the authors. It seems to me that a larger proportion than is usual in books of this kind, will be found suitable and edifying for common choirs aid congregations.

The Selections are well made and well arranged, and are, almost all of them, gems of high musical value. The Eeld from which they were gathered, as not, until now, been explored.  It is rich in fruits, and ithis to be hoped, that such success may attend this first gathering, as to induce the reapers again to try the sickle." :' I Your friend and servant, H. .

The Work abounds in those delicious gems of -the Opera, any one of which is beautiful enough to tempt our readers to the purchase of the whole collection." - Boston Daily Whig.

"GENTLEMEN   ,--Having examined, with some care, the '0vxEu Ckonvs Boox,' of which you are the publishers, I cheerfull gff , yi u my opinion of its particular meritS. As the study and practice of   8 Secular Part. Music has been pursued with increased zeal and suces, within a few years, it has been a leading object to find accessibleadvan- zed works of a good character. The practice of the old standard Glee, however excellent, has lost its novelty, and some of its interest. A higher grade of compositions has been 'required; and the graceful and charming choruses of the modern O'era have given an increasing desire for that class of compositions. "In selecting from the standard works of the day, a knowledge of: the requirements of performers, and a good judgment as to what shall meet these requirements, were imperative. The collection of the OPEtA. CHORUs BOOK has been made with good discretion, combining what is in advance of the current standard, and, at the same time, affording to, social parties, for which it seems to be particularly prepared, the easy means of studying gema of some of the best masters.
