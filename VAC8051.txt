               CHAPTER I. 
               THE ESCAPE FROM JAIL. 
               Not in the orilliantly illuminated ball-room-nor in the elegant mansion of aristocracy and wealth-nor in the gilded saloon of rashionable dissipation-nor yet in the squalid abode of poverty and vice-is the opening scene of our story laid. 
               But within the gloomy walls of a Philadelphia prison-that stern and terrible institution, rendered necessary, of the vices of humanity, to the preservation of social order, and to the prevalence of equal and exact justice among men. 
               Let us traverse, with echoing footsteps, this dark corridor;-we pause before a massive iron door, and, through a narrow aperture, we are enabled to view the interior of the cell. 
               Its sole inmate is a youth of rare personal beauty, possessing a form slender and graceful, yet vigorous, and a faultless countenance, full of expression and fire. 
               It is the young Outlaw, who has been committed to await his trial for one of the most daring and extensive bank burglaries upon the annais of crime-an affair in which his accomplice, known as the "Ribber," was killed by one of the officers of justice. 
               This prisoner is the celebrated Jack Harold; he is examining with intense satisfaction, the tools which have been conveyed to him by the mysterious old man who calls himself the "Wandering Jew." 
               Suddenly the prisoner starts to his feet, his countenance radiant with joy; for, by the aid of these tools, he hopes to gain his liberty, and the hope inspires him with unusual strength, as he resolutely attacks the heavy iron bars at the window of his cell. 
                
               Perhaps there can be no stronger motive in the world, to urge a man to industrious activity, than a desire to accomplish his release from imprisonment. So, at least, thought the young Outlaw, as he vigorously worked upon the iron window bars with his sharp tools; while thoughts of freedom nerved him to the laborious task. 
               By noon he had made considerable progress; and he then desisted from his toil, knowing that the turnkey would soon appear with his dinner. The deep cuts which he had made in the bars, he filled up with a black pus-
                   ty-like substance with which he had been provided; so that it would require a very close inspection in order to observe the marks of the tools. 
               He had just completed every arrangement calculated to avert suspicion, when the cell door was opened, and the turnkey entered with his dinner, consisting of an abundance of coarse but wholesome food. 
               "Your trial will come on to-morrow," remarked the turnkey, as he placed the repast upon the table. 
               "Indeed! 'Tis is sooner than I expected," said the prisoner, with an air of indifference-"I wonder what the devil they will do with me-come, sir; you have some experience in such matters; what sort of a sentence do you suppose I will receive?" 
               "Why, to tell you the truth, Jack," was the turnkey's reply-"I don't think you'll get a moment less than fifteen years!" 
               "Well, there's no help for it," was the prisoner's philosophical rejoinder-"there's no use in mourning over spilled milk; and those who dance must pay the fiddler-two capital maxims which are infernally consoling." 
               "Just so," said the knight of the keys, who was a good-natured fellow, and disposed to be somewhat communicative-notwithstanding which, he was a most vigilant officer-"just so. But I must not forget to mention one thing to you, Jack. The head keeper of the jail, who lives next door that's his house, right under your window-is going to give a grand blow out tonight to his friends, in honor of his daughter's birth-day. There will be dancing, and music, and singing, and drinking; and I shouldn't wonder if the noise kept you awake all night. I am invited to be present; we intend to keep it up all night, and get as drunk as owls." 
               "Well, I hope you may enjoy yourself. I shall not mind the noise," said the prisoner; and the turnkey took his departure. 
               "This is d-d unlucky," thought Jack, when he was left alone-"I shall be obliged to pass through the head jailor's house, in order to reach the street. The house will be full of company, and it is ten chances to one that I will be noticed and arrested. However, I must risk it, for I dare not postpone my escape until to-morrow night, as my trial comes on to-morrow; and I am aware that immediately after the conviction of a prisoner he is sentenced and conveyed to the place destined for his imprisonment, without being returned to this jail. To-night I must escape from this place, or never!" 
               He hastily despatched his dinner, and then resumed his work upon the window bars. During the whole of that afternoon he toiled with untiring industry, and by supper time he felt that three hours' additional exertion wold suffice to accomplish his object. 
               Again he filled up the deep crevices in the iron bars with the black substance. The turnkey entered with his supper, and having placed it upon the table, he advanced to the window, as was his custom every evening, for the purpose of satisfying himself that the prisoner had not been tampering with the stout grating which opposed his exit. 
               Something peculiar in the appearance and movements of the turnkey, attracted Jack's notice; and he soon perceived that the worthy jail functionary had been anticipating the approaching festivities of the night, by getting tolerably well drunk. 
               This was a very fortunate circumstance for our hero; for the oblivious condition of the turnkey greatly diminished the probability of his discovering the marks of the tools upon the bars of the window. 
               "All right, my boy!" he exclaimed, after a brief examination-"I was a little af-afraid that you'd g-give me the 
                  slip, b-but you ca-ca-can't do it now-hic!-be-because after to-night y-y-you won't be under my ch-ch-charge! Tomorrow night-hic!-you'll lodge in the Eastern Pen-pen-i-ten-ten-tiary!" 
               "I wish," said Jack, laughing-that you would honor me with an invitation to the party which the head jailor gives to-night, in celebration of his daughter's birth-day." 
               The turnkey burst into a roar of laughter at the exquisite joke, and stammered forth- 
               "So I would invite you, my boy, if I wasn't af-afraid that you couldn't come-ha, ha, ha! You might be com-compelied to stay at home, you know-ha, ha, ha! Your kind f-f-friends might object to your going out to spend the evening be-because you might for-for-forget to come back-ha, ha, ha! No, Jack; I don't think that you'll have the-hic!-pleasure of drinking to-night to the health of the jailor's l-l-lovely daughter-the pretty Nell Douglass!" 
               "Well," said Jack, demurely-"if you don't invite me, I shall invite myself. Remember, I shall be present at the party to-night, and drink to the health of the pretty Nell Douglass." 
               At this the turnkey laughed louder than ever; and he swore that Captain Douglass, the head jailer, should be informed of the excellent joke. 
               "You're a funny fellow, Jack," said the turnkey, on taking his leave-"I'm so-sorry that you've go-got into this bad scrape, which will-hic!-be sure to shut you up in the stone house for fif-teen years! Ah, well, poor fellow; you'll be sure to come to the party to-night; you won't disappoint your friends; oh, no! of course not! not by any means-ha, ha, ha! I shall be-hic!-sure to expect you-over the left! I so-say, Jack, just tell us at what time you're coming, so that we can nave something ready for you, to eat and drink; something nice and warm, you know-ho, ho ho!" 
               The humorous turnkey narrowly escaped going into convulsions at his own facetiousness. Jack merely remarked to him, as he closed the cell door- 
               "I shall look in and see you at about twelve o'clock!" 
               "Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he! Ho, ho, ho!" roared the other, as he turned the key in the lockand took himself off. 
               Left once more to himself, our hero again went to work upon the bars. As he industriously plied his tools, sounds of boisterous merriment indicated that the festivities of the night had commenced. 
               The clock in a neighboring church steeple struck ten, just as Jack had cut through the last bar which offered an obstacle to his escape. 
               "Thanks to thee, old gray-beard Jew! he muttered-"ere day-break I shall again stand within thy mysterious abode!" 
               Tearing his blankets into strips, he formed a rope of a length and strength sufficient to enable him to descend to the roof of the jailor's house, which was about twenty feet below the window of his cell. It was eleven o'clock when he completed this task. 
               "I will wait another hour," thought he-"by that time the male guests, at least, will probably be somewhat intoxicated, and I shall enjoy a better opportunity of showing the company that some things can be done as well as others!" 
               The midnight hour arrived, and our young Outlaw prepared to prosecute his daring enterprise. 
               Having firmly attached one end of his rope to the iron bed-stead, he lowered the other end out of the window; and then, by the friendly aid of this simple contrivance, he descended in safety to the roof of the jailor's house. 
               The roof being very nearly flat, he was enabled to walk upon it without danger. Discovering a sort of cupola, furnished with windows and a door, he approached it and to his joy found that the door was unfastened. 
               Without a moment's hesitation, he descended the stairs leading into the building. The deepest darkness reigned; yet he could hear the noise and loud shouts of laughter which issued from the apartment wherein the guests of the head jailor were assembled. 
               Groping his way with the utmost caution, he passed down another flight of stairs; and paused before the door of a room in which he knew the company to be at supper-ample evidence of the fact being furnished by the clattering of plates and glasses, to say nothing of the peculiar "pop-phiz-gurgle!" produced by the extraction of corks from bottles of champagne. 
               Our hero peeped through the keyhole, and had a good view of everything inside. The apartment was large, and decently but not expensively furnished. Around a large table, which was spread with the materials of an excellent supper, were seated about a dozen gentlemen and as many ladies-all persons of respectable appearance, evidently not of the bon ton, but belonging to the middle class of society. 
             
             
               CHAPTER II. 
               TERRIBLE EVENTS. 
               Captain Douglass, the governor of the jail, was seated at the head of the table. He was a thick-set, powerfully-built man, apparently about forty-five years of age; the expression of his countenance was severe, although a sort of disdainful smile seemed to be almost continually lingering upon his lips. Now and then he would turn towards a young girl who was seated next to him; and on such occasions the scornful look would instantly vanish from his face, to give place to an expression of the most doting fondness. This young girl was the head jailor's only daughter; and his affection for her was the only redeeming trait in his character-for he was a most violent, unprincipled, selfish man; and to the poor prisoners under his care, he was a tyrant. 
               His daughter, Nell Douglass-in honor of whose seventeenth birth-day this feast was given-was a very pretty, lively, animated girl, with laughing blue eyes, which, joined to the dazzling fairness of her complexion, gave a He-be-like youth to her features and expression. Whenever she smiled, she exhibited a brilliant set of teeth; and therefore, of course, she took good care to smile very often. 
               At her side was seated the turnkey, who had been so amused at Jack Harold's self-invitation to the party. He was evidently an admirer of the pretty Nell, and extremely desirous of initiating himself into her good graces; but, she, being a coquette, took very little notice of the poor fellow, whose eyes sparkled with the combined fires of love, jealousy and wine. 
               This gentleman, whose name, by the way, was Rimser, was one of those easy, good-natured, smooth-going fellows, who, while they pass through life without attracting notice, also glide down life's stream without making enemies. Although, as a turnkey in the jail, he was vigilant, and faithful to the authorities who employed him, he was nevertheless invariably kind to poor prisoners, to the great disapprobation of the stern head jailor, who often rebuked his subordinate for not treating the inmates of the jail with a sufficient degree of vigor and severity 
               In her own heart, the fair Nell Douglass was favorably inclined towar is the good-looking turnkey, although, in a spirit of malicious coquetry, she had point blank refused to marry him, and affected not to care for him the value of a brass button. 
                
               As for Captain Douglass, he had, on hearing of Mr. Rimser's offer of marriage to his daughter, thus addressed him:-"You want my Nell for a wife, sir; you can't have her. I'll tell you why; you're too chicken-hearted to enter the Douglass family. There's too much of the lamb, and too little of the bull-dog about you, to suit me for a son-in-law. Get rid of your milk of human kindness, learn to be savage and rough, treat all prisoners like brutes, and then come and ask my consent to marry Nell; not until then!" 
               But Mr. Rimser, as much as he loved the gruff tyrant's daughter, would not steel his heart against the unfortunate, even for the sake of gaining her hand. 
               All honor to the man who refuses to check the generous impulses of his soul, even at the expense of sacrificing his dearest and most cherished wishes! 
               Mr. Rimser, although somewhat elevated with wine, was not half so much intoxicated as when he had carried our hero his supper; for the hearty repast which he had eaten, in a great measure prevented the fumes of exhilarating beverages from ascending to his brain. This circumstance will account for the coherence of his speech, during the conversation which follows. 
               And every word of that conversation was distinctly audible to Jack, who stood listening at the door. 
               "By the way, Captain Douglass," suddenly exclaimed Mr. Rimser, who had just looked at his watch and found It was half past twelve o'clock-"I've got something to tell you which will make you laugh. You remember the young fellow whom we've now got in jail, and who gives his name as Jack Harold-" 
               "Yes," growled the Captain-"the young scoundrel whose trial comes on to-morrow for attempting to rob the Bank of Mammon. His partner was killed, and it served him right, damn him! Pity this Harold hadn't been killed too; however he'll be hung some day, and that's some comfort-What of him?" 
               "Ever that infernal prophecy-hung! hung! hung!"-muttered our hero, grinding his teeth with an intensity of agony produced by mingled rage and fears for the future. 
               "You shall hear," said Mr. Rimser. "This evening when I carried him his supper, I chanced to mention to him that you were going to give a party tonight in honor of Miss Nell's birthday; whereupon Jack remarked, as cool as a cucumber, that he would look in and see us at about twelve o'clock, and drink the health of the pretty Nell Douglass. It's now half past twelve, and I hardly think that he'll keep his appointment-ha, ha, ha!" 
               Every one seated at the table joined in the laugh, with the exception of Captain Douglass, upon whose stern countenance there gathered a dark frown. 
               "Humph!" said he-"the young rascal's words may contain a deeper meaning than any of you imagine.-Rimser, you have treated him with too much indulgence. You should have fed him on bread and water, and allowed him no bed; the stone floor is good enough for him. More than this, sir, you should have placed him in irons. Why the devil did you neglect to do it, sir?" 
               "I had no orders to that effect," replied the turnkey, with some show of indignation-" I didn't consider that such harsh treatment was at all necessary. What need is there of exercising cruelty towards a prisoner, as long as his security is provided for?" 
               "Silence, sir!" thundered the head jailor-"how dare you question me? Be careful, or you may chance to lose your situation. Did you this evening carefully examine this fellow's cell, and see that everything was perfectly secure?" 
                
               "Yes-it was all right," was the reply. 
               "Mr. Rimser, is Jack Harold handsome?" inquired the pretty Nell, now for the first time taking a part in the conversation; for the subject of the discourse had begun to awaken her interest and curiosity. 
               "Ahem! why, to tell you the truth, Miss Nell," answered the worthy turnkey, who was too honest a fellow to speak disparagingly of the personal appearance of a handsome youth, even in the presence of the woman he loved-"to tell you the truth, the young fellow is rather good-looking; in fact, he is one of the handsomest boys I ever saw; for he isn't over seventeen or eighteen years of age. His form is splendid, and his face is beautiful enough to set half the girls in Philadelphia fairly distracted!" 
               "Oh, how I should like to see him!" cried the young lady, her enthusiasm imparting a rich glow to her dimpled cheeks-"there is something so romantic in a handsome robber!-Ah! I adore such fellows as Dick Turpin, Claude du Val, and Jack Harold! I remember, papa, that good-looking pickpocket, English Tom, whom you had in jail some time ago; what a dashing air, and what fine, bold eyes he had! I declare, I quite fell in love with him, and was almost tempted to steal the keys of the jail and let him out. To-morrow, when Jack Harold is taken out for trial, I am determined to have a peep at him, if I die for it!" 
               "Hush, child," said her father, reprovingly-"how can you speak thus in reference to thieves and felons? As for this Harold, he's a delicate, womanish-looking rascal, with a mind as weak and effeminate as his looks. He threaten to be present at this party! I shouldn't be at all afraid to imprison him in a willow basket, for I am confident that he hasn't the pluck to break out of it. Curse the fellow he hasn't a single particle of manhood in his entire composition!" 
               "LIAR!" 
               This single word was uttered in a loud, stern voice. Everybody turned, and beheld a youth of a slight, but graceful and elegant form, and a countenance of rare beauty. Fierce anger flashed in his eyes, and an expression of ineffable scorn sat upon his lips. 
               Mr. Rimser dropped a glass of wine which he was in the act of drinking, and exclaimed- 
               "Jack Harold, by God!" 
               "Yes," said our hero, proudly-"I am he. Captain Douglass, you are a tyrant, a villain, a bully and a liar! Here, in the presence of your assembled guests, does Jack Harold spit upon and defy you! You called me a coward, and asserted that I lacked the spirit and the courage to break from imprisonment; yet you perceive that I am here, to fulfill my appointment, and to hurl defiance in your teeth! I have come to drink to the health and happiness of that sweet maiden, who is alone disgraced by her relationship to you-hard-hearted miscreant that you are!" 
               The audacious youth snatched from the table a full glass of wine, and raising it high above his head, he exclaimed- 
               "Here's to the health and happiness of the pretty Nell Douglass-may she never get a worse husband than Rimser the turnkey!" 
               Then, looking the head jailor sternly in the face, he added- 
               "And here's damnation to the tyrant!" 
               As he uttered these words, he dashed the full glass of wine, with unerring aim, directly into the countenance of the astounded Captain Douglass, who, as well as the rest of the company, had remained paralyzed with astonishment during the progress of the foregoing extraordinary scene. 
                
               The wine glass was shattered to pieces, cutting the Captain's face in several places, while the ruby contents completely saturated his carefully arranged shirt-frill. 
               "Blood and furies!" cried the maddened head jailor, literally foaming with rage; and, leaping to his feet, he exclaimed, in tones of thunder- 
               "Villain, die the death of a dog!-The law will justify me in shooting an escaped felon. This to your brains!" 
               Quick as lighting he drew a revolver from his breast; and taking a deadly aim at our hero, pressed the trigger- 
               Just as his daughter had thrown herself before him, by a sudden impulse, crying, in imploring accents- 
               "Pray don't shoot him, father!" 
               Too late-too late! The report of the pistol filled the apartment with its mimic thunder, ere the excited man could stay his hand. 
               Jack Harold stood unharmed. 
               But oh, horrible result! the bullet had entered the heart of that ill-fated young girl, and Captain Douglass was the slayer of his own daughter!
                
               It was a frightful and a soul-harrowing scene, such as sometimes haunts us in our dreams! 
               The horrified looks of the guests, who, pale with agitation and terror, seemed rooted to their seats. 
               The shrinking form of Jack Harold, who was overcome by the fearful nature of the catastrophe. 
               The wretched father, his rigid and ghastly face covered with a cold perspiration, the veins upon his forehead swelled almost to bursting, his eyes starting from their sockets. The awful occurrence appeared to have frozen up every faculty of body and soul; he stood with outstretched arms, motionless-like a marble statue of despair! 
               The grief depicted in the honest countenance of the poor turnkey, who supported in his arms the lifeless form of her whom he had sincerely loved. 
               And oh! more horrible than all! the bleeding corpse of that unfortunate girl-so light-hearted and so beautiful-that creature so artless, so innocent and so gay-whose very presence was a ray of sunshine-the "pretty Nell Douglass," who had fallen a victim to her generous desire to save the life of one whom she only knew as a prisoner escaped from jail! 
               A few minutes of intense and death-like silence prevailed. 
               Then, arousing from his lethargy by a mighty effort-like a statue struck by the lightnings of immortal Jove, bursting asunder its shackles of stone, and starting into life-all the horrible realities of the scene rushing upon his disordered mind with the force of a raging whirlwind-with a howl like that of a tiger robbed of its young-the bereaved father sprang upon Jack Harold, seized him by the throat, and hurled him to the floor. 
               Captain Douglass, under any circumstances, was a man of uncommon physical power; but, upon this occasion, his strength was increased four-fold.-His muscular hands encircled our hero's neck with the force of a vice.-Jack's face became livid, and there was every reasonable prospect of his being strangled on the spot-in which case the gallows would have been robbed of a victim, and our narrative would now be brought to an abrupt termination. But it was not so to be. 
               For suddenly the Captain's grasp relaxed, and with a deep groan he fell to the floor, senseless. 
               Jack Harold had stabbed him with the Spanish dirk-knife furnished him by the mysterious Jew. 
               The guests were aroused from their stupor, by this fresh deed of blood; and they gathered around the young Criminal, with loud cries of- 
               "Seize the villain! Kill him! Tear him in pieces!" 
               "Stand off!" cried Jack, brandishing the knife with an air of fierce determination-"I wish not to shed more blood, but the first man who touches me, dies!" 
               The crowd drew back, in fear. It was strange to see stout and rugged men quailing before the lightning glances of that slender but desperate youth! 
               Jack gradually worked his way within reach of the table, and, ere the guests could anticipate his design, he suddenly overturned it. The plates, bottles, glasses, lamps, &c., came to the floor with a tremendous crash, and the room was enveloped in darkness. 
               Five minutes of wild confusion ensued; the bewildered guests stumbled against each other, or fell and bruised themselves amid the ruins of the feast. At length a light was procured; but, on looking around, it was discovered that the daring yonng outlaw had made his escape. 
             
             
               CHAPTER III. 
               THE VOLUPTUOUS ISABELLA AND THE MYSTERIOUS JEW. 
               Let us now proceed to the abode of the arch imposter who styles himself the "Wandering Jew." 
               It is evening, and this man is seated in a well-furnished room, which contains nothing to indicate the peculiar nature of his calling. Stripped of the costume and appointments in which he imposes upon the credulity and excites the awe of his visiters who come to seek mysterious knowledge, we see before us a man possessed of a vigorous form and a dark, repulsive and villainous countenance. His garments betray a vulgar taste, being coarse and showy. His brows are knit, his lips firmly compressed; and, for a while, he seems buried in profound thought. 
               "I have furnished Jack Harold with the proper tools," he muttered-"and, with his skill and daring, he can hardly fail to make good his escape from jail. I am convinced that he suspects nothing of my true identity, and that he will, from motives of curiosity, if nothing else, fulfill his promise and visit me, as soon as he is at liberty.-He must escape to-night, for his tria. comes on to-morrow; and he will probably arrive here at about midnight. I must get him entirely under my control, still retaining my assumed character as the "Jew." When I have succeeded in getting him to commit a MURDER, then will I denounce him to the authorities, and fulfill my oath by seeing him swing upon the gallows! Ha! there goes the bell! Another visiter. The business thrives-I shall grow rich. What weak and credulous fools there are in the world!" 
               A man dressed as a Turk entered the room, and announced that a well-dressed lady, closely veiled, desired an interview with the Wandering Jew. 
               "Does she appear to be a young person?" asked the arch imposter. 
               "Judging from her form and gait, I should say she was," replied the pretended Turk. 
               "Humph! some love-sick damsel, I suppose, who has come to consult me concerning her lover, whom she suspects of inconstancy. With such customers 'tis scarcely worth my while to go through with the coffin and picture performances. I will put on my disguise; and, in five minutes, you will show the lady into this apartment-you understand?" 
               The attendant bowed, and withdrew; while the imposter proceeded to array himself in the mask and habilaments of the "Jew." 
               At the expiration of five minutes, the door opened and a lady entered.-She was richly dressed, and her air was distinguished. Her countenance was entirely concealed by a thick veil. 
               "Be seated, madam," said the imposter, in a hollow tone, as he pointed to a chair. 
               The lady started, no less at the sepulchral voice, than at the fearful appearance of the "Jew." Summoning up courage, however, she took a seat in such a position that, while the imposter remained in shadow, her person was fully revealed to his gaze by the clear rays of the lamp. 
               "What would you with me, madam?" demanded the Jew-"speak freely, for we are alone." 
               "I have heard of your wonderful celebrity as a magician," said the lady, in low, tremulous tones-"and have come to consult you upon a subject of extreme delicacy." 
               "Before we proceed further," said the Jew-"I must request you to raise your veil; for, as the science of physiogomy is one of the principal auxiliaries of my art, it is indispensable that I should behold your face." 
               "I cannot comply with your demand," rejoined the lady, in a some-what haughty tone-"for the nature of my application to you is such as to render it necessary for me to preserve the strictest incognito." 
               "Then, madam," said the Jew, coldly, as he arose from his seat-"our interview is at an end." 
               "Nay, then, if you insist upon it, I will do as you wish;" and with these words the lady raised her veil. 
               The Jew started, as if in surprise; and muttered to himself- 
               "By heavens! I know her now.-What can have brought her here? Yet I see it all; the enlarged proportions of her form tell the whole story. Ah, ah! I shall have no difficulty in convincing this lady of my wonderful powers." 
               The countenance of the lady, who had probably reached her twenty-fourth year, was regular and handsome, though somewhat grave in its expression A keen observer might have detected that this gravity was rather assumed than natural. Her dark brown hair was very elegantly yet simply arranged; and her form, which was somewhat tall, was finely proportioned, and exhibited the outlines of a superb bust. 
               One peculiarity in her form would have struck even a careless observer-the amplitude of her waist which indicated that she was "in that state in which ladies love to be who love their lords." 
               A deep blush suffused her countenance, when she saw that the Jew was regarding her with the closet scrutiny. 
               "She is a glorious and voluptuous creature," muttered the imposter-can I not take advantage of her past frailty by extorting her favors? I shall sec." 
               "Can not your magical science acquaint you with the particular object of my coming here?" inquired the lady. 
               "Ah, you wish to avoid the mortification of a delicate disclosure," said the Jew-"'tis natural. I must consult my magical chart." 
               So saying, he took from a drawer a scroll of parchment, which, on being held to the light, proved to be entirely blank. Muttering certain cabalistic words, he continued for a few minutes to wave this scroll around the flame of the lamp. Finally, there appeared upon the blank parchment a multitude of strange characters and hieroglyphics, whose meaning it would have puzzled Doctor Faustus, or the devil himself, to make out. This feat was not a very astounding one, being easily accomplished by the aid of a superficial knowledge of chemistry. To an ignorant observer, however, it would seem wonderful. 
               The lady, being educated and intelligent, smiled scornfully on witnessing this simple experiment, for she fully comprehended its nature. 
               The Jew now appeared to examine the characters upon the parchment with close attention. Then he affected the greatest astonishment at the information thus acquired and he gazed at his fair visiter with a look of interest and amazement. 
               "Can it be possible, madam," he exclaimed-" that I have the honor of receiving a visit from a lady of your distinction?" 
               "You do not know me," said the lady, with another scornful smile. 
               "Question me," said the Jew-"and you shall be convinced." 
               "I have but little confidence in your power; can you state my name?" 
               "Certainly-Miss Isabella Rich!" 
               The lady screamed with astonishment; but, having long accustomed herself to command her feelings, and to conceal her most violent emotions, under a mask of indifference, she quickly recovered her usual composure-her cold, passionless demeanor. 
               Beneath an exterior which seemed to indicate the absence of every amorous impulse, and the existence of the most rigid virtue, the bosom of this young lady contained a perfect volcano of raging desires and passionate yearnings.
                     See Chapter XXII of "JACK HAROLD," for several graphic illustrations of this hypocritical young lady's extraordinary amativeness.
                  
                
               "What further knowledge have you of me?" asked Miss Isabella Rich. 
               "You are the only daughter of the highest officer in the State of New York." 
               "That, also, is correct; what further?" 
               "You have been indiscreet in an amour." 
               "Go on, strange man!" 
               "You have come to consult me in relation to the best method of concealing your frailty from the knowledge of the world in which you hold so distinguished a position." 
               "Gracious heavens! you read my heart as an open book!" cried the frail fair one, again losing all her cold composure in the excitement of wonder-"mysterious man, you have stated everything correctly; henceforth I shall entertain the most implicit belief in the powers of magic. Tell me-tell me of some sure, safe and secret means of getting rid of the evidence of my frailty, so that my reputation may be preserved; do this, and any reward which you may demand, shall be granted. Besides, you may be assured of my eternal gratitude. The exalted character which I have heretofore sustained, for piety and virtue, would render my exposure doubly mortifying." 
               "I can assist you, madam; but I fear that the reward which I shall require, as a recompense for my services, will seem to you to be preposterous." 
               As the disguised scoundrel uttered these words, he fastened his lustful eyes upon the lady's animated countenance. 
               "State the sum of money that will satisfy you," said Miss Rich, averting her face-"and, however high it may be, it shall be paid you. Fear not to name your price, for I can command almost any sum." 
               "Lady, I crave not money from so sweet a creature as yourself; there is another way in which to requite my services--" 
               The Jew suddenly paused, and advanced towards his fair listener with outstretched arms, as if with the intention of embracing her. 
               The lady regarded him with an expression of undisguised wonder. 
               "I do not comprehend you," said she. 
               "Would you have me speak plainer?" demanded the Jew. 
               "If you were a young man," rejoined the lady, with embarrassment-"there would be but one way of interpreting your words; but surely a person of your very advanced age cannot imagine that--no, sir, you have mistaken me; it must not be. I will take my leave without troubling you any further, since you demand in me a sactifice so odious, and, considering your years, so absurd, so impracticable, and so unnatural." 
               She arose, and walked towards the door. 
               The Jew advanced, and seized her arm. 
               "Hear me, lady," said he, in a voice hoarse, but tremulous with passion-"you know that I am in possession of your most dangerous secrets.-I have but to proclaim my knowledge of your character and situation, to ensure your ruin, your eternal disgrace, and exclusion from respectable society. Think of your distinguished father, your admiring relatives and friends, who all unite in believing you to be a model of piety, chastity and excellence. Would you have your shame trumpeted through the length and breadth of the land-your frailty a rich harvest for miserable penny-a-liners, and your person an object of loathing, for the finger of scorn to point at? Do not, by a foolish refusal to comply with my wishes, ensure your own future misery and degradation!" 
               The wily rascal, in his strong desire to possess his beautiful listener, delivered the foregoing speech with real eloquence and thrilling effect. 
               The lady trembled, while the Jew painted, in such vivid colors, the consequences of her refusing to yield her person up to his embraces. 
               Yet her fear was mingled with as tonishment, that a man so apparently aged, should display a vehemence of amorous passion usually ascribed to fiery youth or vigorous manhood alone. 
               For the fair Isabella Rich was deeply experienced in all the mysteries of intrigue. Not only had the ardor of boyhood and the impetuosity of youth been quenched in her arms, but feeble old age had been warmed into animation by her caresses, and pillowed its withered face upon her volupiuous bosom. 
               We may observe, en passant, that Miss Isabella's interesting condition, upon the occasion to which we are now referring, was owing to the pious efforts of the Rev. Lustful Cheatem, a venerable New York clergyman, and President of the "Man-Eating and Heathen Donation Society." With this gentleman she had for several years been on terms of the most intimate friendship. 
               Recovering some what from the terrifying effect produced by the speech of the Jew, Miss Isabella said to him- 
               "For heaven's sake talk not of exposing me! Any sacrifice, even death itself, would be preferable to that!-But there is something about you, strange man, that I cannot fathom-a something which leads me to suspect that you are not what you seem.-Your voice is changed from the faltering accents of extreme old age to the powerful tones of manhood. How is this?" 
               "I will attempt to deceive you no longer; behold!" cried the imposter tearing off his disguise, and presenting himself to the astonished lady in all his burly strength and ruffianly aspect. 
               "I ought scarcely to be surprised at this sudden transformation," remarked Miss Isabella Rich, quickly recovering her presence of mind-" for I had begun to suspect something of the kind. You are, I confess, far less repulsive to me now than you were in the character of an aged and decrepit man. Aid me in my emergency, and-and- 
               "You will grant all that I require-is it not so, fair creature?" cried the enraptured Jew, as he clasped her rounded form in a warm and vigorous embrace. 
               The beautiful Isabella blushed her assent, as she abandoned herself to the caresses of the ruffian. 
               The change wrought in the appearance of the Jew, by the removal of his disguise, was not more striking than was the alteration in the aspect of this frail lady, now that her passions were aroused by the immediate prospect of indulging in amorous dalliance, even with that villainous impostor. 
               For all her gravity and purity of expression, which she wore as a mantle to conceal the real wantonness of her nature, had vanished, to give place to the glow of desire which now suffused her face, her neck, down to her beautifully rounded shoulders; a glow warm and rich as the hue of the western sky at sunset; a glow produced by her burning blood which coursed madly through every vein. She seemed the very incarnation of the soft and melting passion. 
                      
                        "Her eyes, her lips, her cheeks, her shape, her features. 
                        Seem to be drawn by Love's own hand." 
                     
                  
                
               The licentious Jew glues his hot lips to hers, and the kiss is returned; his coarse hand toys with the luxuriant development of her fine bust, and her actions seem to invite the familiarity. He whispers a few words in her ear, and glances significantly at the door of a chamber which adjoins the room; her looks, in return, not only express a perfect willingness, but a wild impatience. 
               And then the precious pair-the pretended magician and the pretended pious lady-pass into the chamber, and door is closed. 
                
               
                  Upon the expiration of an hour afterwards, Miss Isabella Rich left the abode of the "Wandering Jew," who had her with a letter of address recommendation to one of the most celebrated and infamous female abortionists of the day. 
               When his visiter had departed, the impostor threw himself into a seat and rubbed his hands with every appearance of the most intense satisfaction. 
               "Ah, she is a glorious creature!" he muttered-"during the whole course of my extensive experience in such matters, I have never met her equal. What fire, what impetuosity, what insatiable ardor does she possess! In point of voluptuous beauty, she is scarcely surpassed by that magnificent woman, Mrs. Harold, whom I--but enough of that; that was the darkest crime of my life. Malediction! if her husband, who is now, I hear, a member of Congress, should discover in me the perpetrator of that outrage, I tremble for the consequences. I am safe enough, however, in regard to that matter; but let me leave the subject; for I hate to think of it. The recollection of that crime is associated with murder and vengeance, and yet I can never forget that night of delirious pleasure! 
               "Let me, if possible, consign the past to the dark tomb of oblivion, and reflect upon the present and the future. 'Twas fortunate I knew this Miss Isabella Rich, whom I have often had pointed out to me upon the fashionable promenades of New York, as the daughter of a distinguished politician. My knowledge of her name, connections, &c., astonished her, and established my power over her; as to her being enciente, any ordinary observer would have noticed that fact; and it was a very natural surmise on my part that she had come to consult me as to the best means of screening herself from exposure. Many ladies have visited me on the same delicate business, and all of them have been compelled to grant me their favors, for when once they cross the threshold of this house, they are completely in my power.-Yes-they are in my power in a double sense; both in person and reputation-for, if my threats of exposure fail to make them yield, then force over-powers them-their cries never penetrate beyond these walls, and they are afterwards very little disposed to proclaim the outrage in order to bring me to justice, their visits to me being of such a very questionable character, so far as they are concerned. 
               "Now this Miss Isabella Rich has placed herself in my power, from this night forth. I shall have no difficulty, at any time, in extorting from her almost any amount of caresses and cash, as the price of my silence in regard to her frailty. As to her caresses, she herself assured me that I should be welcome to them at any time, when opportunity served, 'for,' said she 'you play the part of the lover even better than you personate the character of the old man.' As to the matter of cash, money is no object to her, for she is the heiress to a splendid fortune. I have but to ask, to receive." 
               While the impostor was indulging in these reflections, to him so agreeable, the clock struck eleven. 
               "Another hour," he muttered-"and I shall expect the arrival of Jack Harold." 
               The hour passed, and the door bell was rung. 
               "'Tis he!" cried the Jew, in a tone of triumph-"now he shall mount the last round of the ladder which leads to the scaffold!" 
               The Turkish attendant entered. 
               "It is a youth who wishes to see me, is it not?" demanded the Jew, breathlessly. 
               "No-it is another lady," 
               
                  A lady-confusion! Then it cannot be Jack, yet he may have disguised himself in female attire, the better to his escape. That's it! how this lady up!" 
             
             
               CHAPTER IV. 
               ANOTHER LADY VISITER. 
               Scarcely had the Jew assumed his disguise, when the door opened and the new visiter entered. 
               "Welcome, Jack Harold!" cried the impostor, advancing with extended hand. 
               Suddenly he started and drew back; for he perceived that the visiter was a lady, and not the young Outlaw. 
               The conduct of this lady, on hearing the name "Jack Harold," was most unaccountable and extraordinary. With a loud shriek, she staggered back against the wall, and after vainly endeavoring to articulate, fell senseless upon the floor. 
               The Jew raised her up, placed her upon the sofa, and sprinkled water upon her cold and marble-like face, in order to restore her to a state of consciousness. While thus engaged, the following thoughts passed through his mind:- 
               "My frighful appearance has so overpowered this lady, that she has swooned. I can scarcely wonder at it, for I do look rather awful in this masquerade costume. What can be the object of her coming here? Judging from her appearance, I should say most decidedly that she is not in the delicate condition of her predecessor. She probably desires imformation on some subject or other-perhaps concerning a run-away husband, or a lost child, for I perceive that she is a woman of middle age. Though somewhat faded, she is still quite beautiful; and her garb shows that she is a lady of highly respectable position. 
               "There is something in her countenance that seems strangely familiar to me; 'tis not in the outline of her features, nor yet in the expression. But there is a certain indefinable something that reminds me of-of-on my life, I cannot tell whom. It is probable that I have never before seen this lady; yet I am quite positive that I have seen somebody who resembles her to a most remarkable degree. Who that somebody is, I cannot recall to mind. No matter: 'tis of no consequence. 
               "Humph! shall I add this comely dame to the list of those whose favors I have enjoyed, when they have come to consult me? She looks as if she would not submit to my solicitations, under any circumstances. Why not take advantage of her present unconscious scious state? No, I will not; not that that I have any moral scruples, but because my recent delightful interview with Isabella Rich has rendered me indifferent to any immediate gratification. 
               "It is time for Jack Harold to arrive; what can have detained him?-Has he failed in the attempt to escape? If so, all is lost, for to-morrow night he will be within the walls of the Eastern Penitentiary, from which escape is impossible, as I have good reason to know, having myself passed five years in its gloomy cells, and made every effort to gain my liberty, in vain. 
               "May all the saints assist him in escaping to-night! If he fails, to-morrow he will be taken into court and sentenced to fifteen or twenty years' imprisonment. Either he or I may die before the expiration of that time;and then will I be cheated of my vengeance!
                
               "But, if the good saints shall aid him in the enterprise of to-night, he shall swing upon the gallows before the expiration of another year! 
               "When I exhibited to him the two pictures of magic lantern, I intended that the hanging scene in the yard of the Egyptian Tombs should be fulfilled; not so, however, with the picture representing the interior of the Eastern Penitentiary, which I merely introduced for effect, as a preliminary to the execution scene. Heaven grant that the Eastern Penitentiary scene may never be fulfilled, for I have something far more terrible than that, in reserve for the object of my hate! 
               "If he does not arrive within an hour, I shall begin to despair. So, so! the lady revives. Fear not, madam; let out my appearance frighten you.-No harm shall happen to you." 
               The lady slowly opened her eyes, and gazed about her with an air of be wilderment. Soon she became fully conscious of her situation. Raising herself from her recumbent position upon the sofa, she regarded the false Jew with a look in which there was much of wonder and inquiry, but not a single trace of fear. 
               Now that her handsome but rather care-worn countenance was illumined by the intelligence of a pair of fine, expressive eyes, the Jew became still more strongly convinced that he had seen some person who bore to her most astonishing resemblance. 
               "When I entered this apartment," said the lady-" you pronounced the name of Jack Harold; it was my astonishment at hearing that name which caused me to swoon," 
               "Why were you astonished at hearing it?" demanded the Jew, profoundly surprised-"do you know the person who bears that name?" 
               "It was concerning that very person that I came to consult you. I had little faith in your art, but my extreme anxiety in regard to the youth drove me here. Judge, then, my astonishment, on entering this room, to hear you utter his name, before I had opened my lips. Every doubt of your supernatural powers is removed. Wonderful man, now knew you that I came to consult you respecting that particular person. 
               "Humph! a very singular coincidence of events," said the Jew to himself-"supposing her to be Jack in disguise, I utter his name; this lady, who has come here for the purpose of seeking information in regard to Jack, thinks that I announce the object of her coming; she ascribes my supposed knowledge of her unuttered wish, to my magical art-and she is, of course, astonished. What a remarkable combination of circumstances, all tending to impress her with the fullest belief in my powers as a magician! Now can I work upon her credulity with success. What under heaven can she want in know about Jack? but perhaps the young rascal has robbed her, and she wishes to find out some means of recovering ering the booty. I shall see anon." 
               "Madam," said the impostor, aloud-"the sublime mysteries of my science enables me to read within your heart the unexpressed desire to gain information concerning the person whom I named on your first entrance here. Several days ago my prophetic gifts announced to me that you would come here to-night, at twelve, for the purpose of knowing something of Jack Harold, as he is called. But that is merely a name given him by his adopted parents; he is an illegitimate child." 
               "My God! that is true," cried the lady, hiding her face in her handkerchief, and sobbing violently. Her emotion caused a flood of light to rush upon the mind of the Jew, who, on again obtaining a view of her countenance, said to himself- 
               "It must be so, and I am blind not to have arrived at the fact sooner, for the resemblance between them is most striking and remarkable." 
               "Madam," added he, aloud-"shall I continue to speak of this young man in whom you seem to be interested?" 
               The lady assented by a sign. 
               "Well, then: Jack Harold, although a mere youth, has attained to a rare distinction in crime; he is, in short, a most notorious Criminal." 
               "Spare me-oh, in pity spare me!" cried the wretched woman, in piercing accents. 
               "He is destined to terminate his career upon the gallows," said the Jew, in a tone of malicious triumph. 
               "God, in his infinite mercy, forbid!" exclaimed the lady, clasping her hands and raising her streaming eyes to heaven. 
               "This gallows-doomed Criminal is your own son!" 
               The unhappy and unfortunate Clarissa Cooper-the mother of Jack Harold-would have again fallen to the floor, had she not been caught in the arms of the villainous Jew. 
               Recovering herself by a powerful effort, she released herself from her support, and by degrees became tolerably calm. 
               The impostor seated himself at a little distance from her, and regarded her with a sort of ferocious satisfaction. It seemed as if the deep and intense hatred which he felt towards the son, extended itself also to the mother. 
               After a pause of a few minutes, Miss Cooper said, in a low and tremulous tone- 
               "In the hour of my shame and sorrow-for I was the victim of a villainous seducer-I abandoned my child to the mercy of strangers. The knowledge of my history which you have already displayed, mysterious man, assures me that you are acquainted with many circumstances which it is unnecessary for me to repeat." 
               "Concerning the miniature and other matters," suggested the Jew, who knew the whole story, which had been imparted to him in detail by the 'Prince,' Jack's father. 
               "Yes," continued the lady, sadly "I never knew the name of the kind family who adopted and reared my son as their own. Shame, and the fear of exposure, prevented me from making any inquiries after him. Six yearsage I fancied that I saw him, under very strange and mysterious circumstances, but I may have been mistaken. I have, up to this very day, been in profound ignorance, not only of his fate, but of his name. In company with my parents, I arrived this very morning from Washington. Fatigued with travelling, I retired to my chamber, in order to seek a little repose. Dreams crowded upon me, for my mind was troubled; I saw, in my fancy, a young girl, for the purpose of protecting herself from violence, plunge a glittering knife into the breast of my seducer, whose name was--" 
               "The Prince, John Hamblin," observed the Jew interrupting her 
               "Yes, that was his name; I saw him weltering in his gore, and I felt that he had met the just reward of his villainy." 
               "Your dream was correct, for the Prince met his death in precisely the manner you have described," remarked the Jew, much surprised-for, pretended magician as he was, he had no real faith in the accuracy of dreams. 
               "If John Hamblin is dead, the world has got rid of a villain," continued Miss Cooper. "Often have I been tempted to destroy his life; but the dread of staining my soul with the awful crime of murder restrained me. I next dreamed that the young girl who slew my seducer became intimate with a youth of lawless habits, who was called Jack Harold, and who was my own son. Frightened and trembling, I awoke, and endeavored to forget the visions of my sleep by glancing over the columns of an old newspaper in which I had wrapped several articles of the toilet. Conceive my astonishment when my eyes fell upon a paragraph of two lines, which read thus:-"The celebrated Jack Harold has again escaped from the Refuge." The name exactly corresponded with that of the subject of my dream. I was overwhelmed with wonder at a coincidence so extraordinary. Something whispered to my soul that the person alluded to in the newspaper was my son; and the mysterious instincts of nature prompted me to seek that person out, if possible." 
               "Therefore you came directly to me," remarked the Jew. 
               "I did, having previously heard of your fame as a magician. I came here with very little confidence in your power, but the first words you uttered satisfied me that your pretensions are just. And now, whoever you may be, I pray you to inform me where this youth-my son-can be found. Though he be guilty of a thousand crimes, I will none the less fondly clasp him to this maternal breast.' 
               The Jew remained silent for a few minutes, during which his thoughts were not idle, but moulded themselves into the following form:- 
               "It is very singular that she should not have seen, in the newspapers of the present week, the lengthy accounts of the great bank burglary in which Jack Harold was concerned. But it is very evident that she has not seen these accounts, for if she had, she would have known at once that Jack Harold-whom she so anxiously seeks, and of whose whereabouts she seems to be in such profound ignorance,-was probably to be found in snug quarters within the walls of the Philadelphia jail. I'll question you on this point." 
               "Madam," and the Jew-"the criminal exploits of your hopeful son at present fill almost every newspaper in America. How comes it, then, that after dreaming of Jack Harold, you did not immediately identify the vision of your sleep with the celebrated young criminal who bears the same name?" 
               "For the simple reason, sir, that I seldom or never look into a newspaper my reading being limited almost entirely to the Bible and other religious books. I was not aware that there was a great criminal called Jack Harold; would to heaven that I had never known it!-Now, sir, take pity on an afflicted mother, and tell me where I may find my erring son! Though he be a thousand miles distant from this, I will fly to him, and on my bended knees win him back into the path of integrity and virtue!" 
               The Jew was about to make some reply, when he was interrupted by the sound of the door-bell, which was rung with violence. 
               An expression of joy and expectation then sat upon the villainons countenance of the imposter. 
               The Turkish attendant made his appearance at the door, and, having held a whispered consultation with his master, he retired. 
               The Jew then approached the lady who was sitting calm and unmoved upon the sofa. She observed a sort of fiendish triumph in the eyes of the accomplished scoundrel, for which she could not account. 
               "Madam," said he-"how would you like to see your son this very night?" 
               To-night!" cried the lady, in surprise. 
               "Yes-within an hour, in this very house." 
               "Is this possible?" 
               "All things are possible to me!-Yes, you shall see your son, provided you swear to comply with certain conditions which I shall name." 
               "I will agree to anything, if I can see my son," said the mother of our hero, eagerly. 
               "Listen, then," said the Jew, in whose polluted soul a dark and horrible plot had already been hatched.-"You will conceal yourself in the room which adjoins this. A small aperture in the wall will enable you to see and hear all that passes in this apartment. I will receive your son here; I will draw him into conversation, and, unconscious of your presence he will give utterance to his true sentiments without any restraint. Thus you can have an excellent opportunity of judging his character as it really is. Do you agree to this?" 
               "Yes-anything to see my son." 
               "Whatever you may hear, be careful to suppress any movement or exclamation of surprise or horror." 
               "Fear not-I shall be discreet." 
               "When I have done conversing with your son, I shall, in a whispered tone, acquaint him with the fact that his mother is in the next room, waiting to embrace him." 
               "Thanks-oh, a thousand thanks!" 
               "You must be content to remain in darkness, until your son shall enter, bearing a light. The moment that he enters, you must run towards him with extended arms 
               "Ah! holy nature and nature love would prompt me to do that, without instruction." 
               "Run towards him with extended arms-but observe: your veil must be closely drawn over your face, and you MUST SPEAK NOT ONE WORD." 
               "The conditions are hard, but I agree to them, so that I see my son." 
               "Fail not to comply with all these conditions to the very letter, or you shall be separated from your son forever; you know my power." 
               "I shall do everything as you have said." 
               "Swear it, by the **** *****!" 
               "You frighten me! But to see my son-yes, I solemnly swear it!" 
               "Enough-now follow me into the adjoining room." 
               The Jew opened a door, and conducted the lady into a small apartment which appeared to be entirely unfurnished. In the wall was a narrow aperture which would enable a concealed person to witness whatever might occur in the larger room, and, at the same time, to hear whatever might be said. 
               The lady, by the directions of the Jew, stationed herself at this aperture. Then the impostor passed out into the larger room, carefully closing the door of communication between the two apartments. 
               Having seated himself, as was his custom, in a place remote from the glare of the lamp, the Jew rang a bell. 
               The door opened, and Jack Harold made his appearance. 
             
             
               CHAPTER V. 
               MOTHER AND SON. 
               "Welcome! I congratulate you on your restoration to liberty," cried the arch impostor. 
               "For which I must return you thanks," said our hero, as he threw himself into a chair-"and yet I could almost wish that I were still an inmate of my solitary cell." 
               "How! you regret having effected your escape! You could wish to have remained, in order to receive a sentence of fifteen or twenty years' imprisonment! What mean you?" 
               "My escape has been attended with bloodshed." 
               "Ha! state every particular, I pray you," said the Jew, with trembling eagerness. 
               "How comes it, O wise prophet and wonderful magician!" exclaimed Jack, with a scarcely perceptible sneer-"how comes it, I say, that you, knowing everything past, present and to come, are in ignorance of the deeply unfortunate and tragical circumstances which attended my escape? But listen, and I will tell you all." 
               Our hero then related all the details of his escape, with which the reader is already acquainted. When he described the appalling scene in the supper room of the jailor's house, and told how Captain Douglass had shot his own daughter, and how he (Jack) had stabbed the Captain himself, he feared, mortally-when, we say, our hero had stated all these circumstances, the Jew, unable to restain himself longer, gave utterance to the most extravagant joy. 
               "By heavens!" he cried-"the summit of my wishes is already attained, for you have committed a murder!" 
               A smothered groan was heard to proceed from the adjoining room. Jack started, and glanced inquiringly at the Jew, who cast a look of fierce anger towards the aperture in the wall. 
               "What was that?" demanded our hero. 
               "'Twas nothing but the wind moaning over the house-tops," answered the other-"but are you sure that you killed Captain Douglass!" 
               "The case was desperate, and I stabbed him severely. I am afraid that 'tis all over with him." 
               "Good-good!" muttered the Jew-"he has committed a murder, and I can now at any time place him in the hangman's hands!" 
               "For what purpose did you request me to come here?" asked the young Criminal. 
               "You will know presently. Now that you are at liberty, what are your plans for the future?" 
               "I shall continue in my career of crime!" 
               "Do you never think of repentance?" 
               "Bah! repentance!-'tis the idle prattle of fools! It is impossible to repent, for the world never forgives a departure from the line of its own stiff propriety. The woman who falls from virtue can never rise again; the man who swerves from honesty must remain forever a branded Outlaw!" 
               A deep and long-drawn sigh from the aperture in the wall reached the sharp eyes of the Jew, and again were his eyes turned in that direction with an expression of anger. 
               "Do you never feel any remorse-any qualms of conscience, on account of your evil deeds!" inquired the impostor. 
               "I did once-but that day is past. Henceforth, I shall recklessly plunge onward in a course of guilt, nor pause until I reach--" 
               "The gallows," said the Jew, calmly. 
               "Ay, the gallows! You yourself, old man, prophesied that thus should terminate my career, and I believe you to be a true prophet. 
               "The contemplation of my probable fate no longer inspires me with horror. When the day of my doom arrives, I shall mount the scaffold with a firm step, and die with a bold heart and an unblanched cheek. But would to heaven that I could meet that villain o a Spaniard who first initiated me in crime! Eternal fury light upon him! I would tear out his accursed heart." 
                
               The Jew smiled strangely as he heard these words, and his eyes glittered like those of a serpent. 
               "I applaud your courage," said he-"and you may ere long have an opportunity to test it. I have now something very particular to say to you; and, in order to be on the safe side, I will communicate with you in a whisper." 
               Casting a look of assurance towards the aperture in the wall-as if by way of announcing to the concealed lady that he was then about to inform Jack of his mother's presence-the Jew arose and seated himself in a chair close to our hero. 
               "What I have to tell you is of the greatest importance," said the artful and accomplished villain, in a tone so low as to be entirely inaudible to the concealed lady, who was gazing through the aperture with the utmost interest, anxiety and impatience. 
               "Proceed," said our hero. 
               "You must answer, faithfully and truly, every question which I shall put to you; for there are certain matters beyond the reach of my magical art." 
               "Ask, and if proper, I will answer." 
               "What has become of Gallus Kate?" 
               Jack's brow grew dark, as he replied- 
               "Curse her! She left me in the city of Washington, penniless; she eloped with a fellow whom she scarcely knew, named Armitage." 
               "That was a scurvy trick, for she professed to love you. Why don't you punish her for her perfidy?" 
               "I was in pursuit of her when I got into this unlucky bank business, which led to my arrest. She and her lover are in Pittsburg, and I shall follow them." 
               "Speak lower. What will you do to her, when you find her?" 
               "I know not; I fear that I shall be tempted to slay both her and her paramour." 
               "What! you surely could not have the heart to injure Kate-lovely Kate-whom you love so well?" 
               "Love! I hate her worse than hell itself! She has proved herself treacherous, cruel and mean; and by heavens! I will have terrible revenge!" 
               "Softly-softly; don't speak so loud," whispered the Jew, as our hero, carried away by his excitement, raised his voice; and then the wily rascal said to himself- 
               "Merely by accident, but by the greatest good fortune, I have hit upon the right track. I have now only to spur him on." 
               "So," remarked the Jew, in the cautious whisper which he had adopted-"you will go to Pittsburg?" 
               "Yes-and I shall do a murder in Pittsburg, if I can but find her of whom I am in search." 
               "Speak lower, or Kate may overhear you." 
               "Kate-what Kate?" 
               "Why, Gallus Kate, to be sure-who else?" 
               "Explain yourself-what do you mean?" 
               "I mean that she whom you seek is in this house." 
               "'Tis impossible-'tis false!" 
               "Why impossible, and why false? Is it very wonderful that she should have tarried in Philadelphia, instead of going to Pittsburg? Is it very strange that she should have come to consult me in regard to your fate? I tell you, boy, that she whom you call Gallus Kate is in the next room." 
               Jack started from his seat, but the strong hand of the Jew restrained him. 
               "Be patient-be calm!" whispered the impostor-"or I swear you shall not see her. Sit down!" 
               Jack reluctantly resumed his seat. His dark and desperate soul thirsted for revenge upon the perfidious Kate. 
               "Restrain yourself," said the Jew, who still continued to speak in a low and almost inaudible whisper-"utter not one word until I give you permission sion, or by all that's sacred I will cheat you of your vengeance! Do you promise? If so, nod your head." 
               Jack gave the required sign of assent, and the impostor proceeded. 
               "An hour ago, Kate came here in order to consult me concerning you. She asked me how long a sentence you would get, on the bank burglary. I told her fifteen or twenty years. She remarked with a smile of scorn upon her beautiful lip-'I am glad of it; he deserves it, for he is a cowardly and contemptible puppy." 
               Jack writhed in his seat; his countenance grew black with suppressed rage; a cold perspiration covered his forehead, and his glaring eyes were fastened upon the door leading into the next room. 
               The Jew continued:- 
               "Do not be offended with me for giving you the substance of Kate's remarks. 'I never cared a copper for the poor fool,' said she-'I only made use of him for my own purposes. Now that he is deprived of my support, the miserable devil will starve to death.' And then she laughed heartily, in her sweet and silvery manner, at the comical look of astonishment and mortification which (she said) your namby-pamby countenance must have worn, when you discovered that she had abandoned you and left you penniless." 
               Jack literally foamed with rage; his entire form quivered with the intensity of his passions; his teeth were ground together as closely as if he had been afflicted with lockjaw, and his hands were clenched with a force that brought blood from the palms of them. 
               The Jew observed with hellish satisfaction these evidences of our hero's mad excitement, which was absolutely essential to the diabolical purpose that he had in view. He continued:- 
               "Kate assured me, just before your arrival here, that while you and she lived together in New York, she had over a dozen favored levers, while you, poor fool! (I use her own language,) fondly imagined that she was faithful to you." 
               Jack groaned with the agony of his pent-up rage. The Jew remarked- 
               "You may speak now; but remember-in a whisper only." 
               "Lend me a dirk-knife!" 
               The words came hissing from between the set teeth of our hero. The Jew-who had anticipated such a request, and prepared himself accordingly-secretly passed to him a large and glittering weapon of the most formidable and murderous appearance, saying- 
               "Conceal this in your coat-sleeve until just before you strike-so, that's right. Now take the lamp in your left hand, walk calmly to that door, open it, and enter the room. The deceitful hussy, on seeing you, will perhaps run towards you with her arms extended, with the intention of bestowing upon you a Judas-like kiss. When near enough, stab her in the left breast; give her the full length of the steel, so that it may cleave her false heart in twain!" 
               "I need no instructions; I am not so much of a novice in the business as you may imagine," responded the desperate youth, in a hoarse whisper. His agitation had suddenly vanished, to be replaced by the most rigid determination. He was deadly pale, and his eyes had that cold, hard and stony expression which is a thousand times more terrible than the sparkle and the flash of excited rage. 
               For the false words of the lying Jew-words carefully selected by the abominable scoundrel as being best calculated to drive his intended victim into a perfect phrenzy of rage-those galling words, we say, had aroused within the breast of the young Outlaw a stern and iron-like resolution to take the life of his former paramour, "Gallus Kate,' whom he firmly believed to be in the adjoining room. 
               The reader of course perfectly comprehends the fiendish design of the villianous lianous Jew, who had artfully arranged everything to the end that Jack Harold might qualify himself for the gallows by murdering his own mother!
                
               And now the young Outlaw takes in his left hand the lamp; then, with a firm tread, he advances to the door, and opens it. He has scarcely crossed the threshold, when a veiled female rushes towards him with extended arms. He quickly draws the knife from beneath his sleeve, and raises it high in air in order to give the murderous thrust. 
               The lady, observing this sudden movement, starts back in alarm, and exclaims, in accent of mingled affection and reproach- 
               "Oh, my son-my son!" 
               And her life is saved. 
               For Jack instantly recognizes her voice, and, throwing away his weapon, he clasps his mother in his arms, and weeps like a child. 
               And now, for the first time in many years, does the unfortunate Clarissa Cooper press to her desolate bosom the long-lost son. Her maternal instinct tells her that she is not deceived. 
               It is a deeply affecting scene-this strange meeting of the heart broken mother with her ruined and outlawed son. 
               But that scene is of brief duration; for, like a stealthy serpent, the Jew comes gliding into the apartment, and hoarsely whispers- 
               "Is it done?" 
               Then, seeing that his diabolical plan has failed, he gives vent to his disappointment in a deep and terrible curse. 
               Jack turns upon him with the fury of a wounded panther, seizes him by the throat, and with irresistible force hurls him to the floor, at the same time exclaiming- 
               "So, damned villain! you would have had me murder my mother! Thank heaven, your infernally artful plot, though so nearly successful, has failed! Keep off, or by all that's sacred old man, magician or devil though you be, I'll strangle you!" 
               But the seemingly aged Jew possessed an amount of physical strength of which our hero was little aware. Springing upon Jack with concentrated fury, he commenced a most violent and savage attack upon him; and the pair rolled over and over upon the floor in a most desperate struggle, their eyes gleaming with all the ferocity inspired by their mutual hatred. 
               Clarissa Cooper was an affrightened spectator of the scene. 
               The Jew was too powerful for Jack, who, notwithstanding his indomitable courage, would soon have been entirely at the mercy of his implacable enemy, had not his hand, during the scuffle, fortunately come in contact with the dirk-knife which he had thrown away, on recognizing his mother. 
               Firmly grasping this deadly weapon, he attempted to stab the Jew with it, but the scoundrel avoided the thrust, and, releasing his antagonist, precipitately retreated to a corner of the room. 
               For, during the contest, his long grey beard, and every other portion of his disguise, had been torn in pieces, and his own hideous countenance was now fully exposed to view. 
               "LOPEZ THE SPANIARD!" exclaimed Jack, scarcely believing the evidence of his own senses. 
               The Spaniard-for such we shall hereafter call him-made no immediate reply, but coolly walked into the adjoining room and deliberately rang the bell with which he was accustomed to summon the miserable fellow who, before visiters, played the part of his Turkish attendant. The latter made his appearance, and, having received from his master certain hasty and whispered instructions, he gave a nod of intelligence and retired. 
               This done, the Spaniard returned to the room where the mother and son were enjoying an interview whose sanctity we will not invade-nor is it at all necessary that we should do so. 
               After surveying them for a few minutes with a look of intense scorn, hatred and baffled rage, Lopez the Spaniard said- 
               "Happy meeting of a precious pair! Mother and son-ha, ha, ha!-The mether, the former mistress of a notorious felon; the son, an escaped prisoner and branded Outlaw! I wish you both joy of this encounter, so unexpected to both, and, evidently, so extremely gratifying." 
               "Beware, villain!" cried Jack, advancing towards him, menacingly, with the dirk-knife-"provoke me not to do an act which would instantly consign your blackened soul to the flames of hell! Why did you plot to have me slay my mother? Could the oath of vengeance which you have sworn against me, be satisfied with nothing less than that? 
               "Malediction!" exclaimed the Spaniard, with sudden rage-"that I should be thus cheated of the sweetest morsel of revenge that I ever prepared for my longing lips! God! what a triumphant fulfilment of my oath, boy, to have had you hung for the murder of your mother! But no matter; you shall swing for the murder of Captain Douglass, the head jailor. Do you hear? you shall swing for it, I say." 
               "Peace, ruffian!" cried Jack-"or with this weapon, furnished me by yourself for a horrible purpose, I will cut off your blasphemous tongue and dig out your vile heart!-Come, mother," he added, turning to the lady, whose bosom swelled with emotion on being addressed by that title, of all others the most tender and beautiful-"let us leave the den of this villainous impostor, and seek a purer atmosphere. I will keep the promise which I gave you, and abandon my course of crime forever." 
               "God grant it, my son," sobbed the unfortunate lady; and, leaning on Jack's arm, she passed into the larger room and approached the door leading to the passage. 
               "Hold!" cried the Spaniard, regarding Jack with a venomous look, such as the most malignant demon in hell might have envied-"hold! we part not thus easily. You shall not yet go hence, neither shall you quit your career of crime." 
               "Out of the way, reptile!" said our hero, scornfully-"the presence of my mother here alone prevents me from teaching you a lesson in the science of vengeance, of which, with all your cunning, you have no conception." 
               "I repeat it," said the Spaniard, with a peculiar look-"you cannot depart hence." 
               "Fool! who will prevent me?" demanded our hero, scornfully. 
               "The officers of justice!" thundered the other-"I hear their footsteps upon the stairs, even now. They are here. To me you are indebted for your escape; and to me also shall you be indebted for your re-capture." 
               At this moment the door was thrown violently open, and Rimser, the jail turnkey, made his appearance, followed by a police officer and two or three watchmen. The poor turnkey looked pale and haggard; the sudden and awful death of pretty Nell Douglass, the head jailor's daughter, pressed heavily upon his soul, and rendered him the most miserable of men. 
               He pointed at Jack, who was immediately taken into custody. The unfortunate mother looked on, her eyes streaming with tears. 
               "Calm yourself, dear mother," said Jack-"we shall meet again." 
               "Yes," muttered the Spaniard-"you shall meet again, but it will be when you, Jack, are preparing for the scaffold!" 
               This brutal remark was unheard by the others. 
               "Mr. Rimser,' said our hero, in a tone of deep commiseration-'pray inform me, sir, is Captain Douglass dead?" 
               "He is not," was the reply-"although desperately wounded, and exhausted by loss of blood, the physician gives it as his decided opinion that he will recover." 
               "Thank God!"? exclaimed Jack, fervently. 
               "Captain Douglass not dead-likely to recover!" thought the Spaniard, deeply disappointed-"perdition! In that case there is no immediate prospect of Jack's being swung. My usual good fortune seems to have deserted me; for on all sides I meet with nothing but disappointment." 
               Our hero again addressed the turnkey, in faltering accents- 
               "And-and-Miss Douglass-is she--" 
               "She is dead," said poor Rimser; and, brushing away a tear, he gave orders for Jack's removal to jail. 
               At the earnest entreaty of our hero, one of the watchmen, an elderly, respectable looking man, promised to conduct Miss Cooper in safety to the hotel at which she and her parents were stopping. The parting between the mother and son was deeply affecting to all present, with the exception of the Spaniard, who now experienced another disappointment; for the arch villain had cherished the hope of being able to retain Miss Cooper as a prisoner in his house-make her the object of his hellish passions, and vent upon her inoffensive head all the malignant hatred which he cherished towards her son. 
               When, therefore, he saw her depart from the house, under the protection of a worthy man whose sterling integrity he knew to be superior to all bribery, he ground his teeth in secret and impotent rage. 
               Jack was conveyed back to the jail from which he had so recently escaped. He was not of course placed in the same cell from which he had broken out, but was accommodated with temporary lodgings in a large cell wherein several other prisoners were confined. On account of its massive structure, this cell was known as the "Strong Room," and escape from it was deemed impossible. 
               In the Strong Room was Jack locked up, and left to the enjoyment of his own not very agreeable meditations. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VI. 
               A GENTLEMAN IN DIFFICULTIES. 
               Stretched upon a rude couch of straw, our hero soon fell into a feverish and uneasy slumber, from which he did not awaken until the beams of the morning sun, straggling in through the grated windows, played upon his face. 
               He started up, rubbed his eyes, and for a few moments his bewildered senses comprehended not the realities of his situation. Soon, however, the mists that obscured his mental vision were dispelled, and he began to appreciate the disadvantages of his position, to their fullest extent. 
               He recollected all the events of the last few hours, and could not restrain his tears as he thought of his poor mother, to whom he had been united for so brief a season, and from whom he had been separated under such painful circumstances. Then, when his mind dwelt upon the melancholy and tragical fate of the unfortunate Nell Douglass, a feeling of profound sorrow took possession of his soul; for he considered himself as having been the involuntary cause of her death at the hands of her father. 
               His own prospect he contemplated with feelings of the deepest despair; for well he knew that his having attempted to take the life of the head jailor-leaving the bank robbery entirely ly out of the question-would in all probability consign him to a prison cell for the remainder of his life. 
               He sat down upon his miserable bed and, in order to divert his thoughts from the painful channel into which they were beginning to flow, he began to examine the cell, its appointments, and its occupants. 
               It was lighted by two grated windows, and was in a tolerable state of cleanliness. Besides his own bed, there were three other beds, each of which was tenanted by a fellow captive. 
               One of these individuals was awake, and eyed our hero with considerable curiosity and interest. He was a long, lean, gaunt fellow, forty-five or fifty years of age, with a grizzly beard and a shock of dirty hair. His entire appearance proclaimed him to be a member of the extensive fraternity of loafers.
                
               This gentleman lay in bed with his solitary blanket drawn close up to his chin; and, as the said blanket chanced to be of exceeding brevity, his feet and the lower parts of his legs were entirely uncovered. 
               There was something so irresistibly comic in the man's situation and appearance, that Jack, in spite of his grief and despair, could not help laughing. 
               "Ah, you may well laugh, young feller," said the strange gentleman, in a tone which partook 'more of sorrow than of anger'-"you see before you a feller critter that has experienced many reverses of fortune-one that has been high in office, and in the confidence of his fellow-citizens, but now is, by the inscrutable decrees of Providence, actually destitute of a shirt.-Young feller, take warning by my fate; avoid the path of sin and death before it is too late. Beware of the flowing bowl, and lay up your treasures in heaven. Have you got any tobacco about you?" 
               Jack courteously replied that he did not use the article, a circumstance which (he said) he regretted, as he was thereby prevented from supplying the wants of his new friend. 
               "Ah, no matter," said the strange gentleman; and then he added, with a thoughtful air-"I s'pose that you haven't got such an article as a quarter of a dollar about you?" 
               "Yes, I have," answered our hero, who was beginning to be much amused with the fellow. 
               "Have you though?" exclaimed the strange gentleman; and the intelligence seemed to be so agreeable to him, that he brightened up amazingly-"I s'pose that you'd object to lending that trifling coin to a perfect strarger?" 
               "By no means," said Jack, as he good-naturedly produced and handed over the 'trifling coin' in question-. "I am always happy to accommodate a gentleman in difficulties." 
               "Come to my heart, my best, my dearest friend!" cried the gentleman in difficulties, as, in a transport of gratitude he leaped out of bed and embraced our hero with a fervor that was rather annoying than otherwise. 
               With considerable difficulty, Jack extricated himself from the clasp of his affectionate friend, whose remark in reference to his being destitute of a shirt was not merely metaphorical; for he was indeed minus that useful article of raiment, and now stood in a condition of perfect nudity. 
               "Be not surprised at my appearance, friend of my soul," said the shirtless gentleman, as he proceeded to invest himself in a suit of clothes which had attained the last degree of shabbiness-"holy Nature demanded food, and I disposed of my shirt for the benefit of my stomach; and now I am like the last rose of summer which was left blooming alone, with all its lovely companions stepped out and gone!" 
               "Pray, sir, what are you confined here for?" inquired Jack, as he narrowly regarded the strange gentleman; for it occurred to him that they had met before. 
               "I am accused," replied the other, looking hard at our hero-"of a deficiency in the quality of integrity; of an inclination to indulge in practices of dishonesty; in short," cried the strange gentleman, with a burst of indignation-"I am charged with purloining a leg of pork!" 
               "But you are innocent, of course," remarked Jack, dubiously. 
               "Innocent!" exclaimed the strange gentleman, smiting his breast in a manner to indicate that it was the abode of unsullied honor-"innocent! Is the unborn babe guiltless? Is the moon chaste? Is the snow-drop pure? Is the heaven holy? Innocent! Well, I'll bet I am!" 
               It is impossible to describe the air of proud and mournful dignity with which the strange gentleman denied the truth of the odious charge preferred against him. 
               The longer Jack looked at his new acquaintance, the more he became convinced that he had known him before. At length a sudden remembrance flashed upon his mind, and he abruptly inquired- 
               "Pray, is not your name Piggot?" 
               The strange gentleman evinced considerable surprise, and admitted that his name was Piggot. 
               "Were you not formerly the overseer of the New York House of Refuge?" asked Jack. 
               "I once had the honor of occupying that proud and exalted position, young feller," replied the other, with sudden dignity-"but how did you become acquainted with my name and former occupation?" 
               "First tell me," said Jack-"by what reverses of fortune you became reduced from that 'proud and exalted position,' as you call it, to your present deplorable situation. Then I will tell you my name, and I think that we will prove to be old acquaintances." 
               "The tale of my downfall is a melancholy one," said Mr. Piggot, dolefully shaking his head, whose 'knotted and combined locks' betrayed its innocence of all knowledge of a comb.-"Our party got defeated, and of course every one that held an office got kicked out; myself among the rest. In vain did I declare that I loved my country better than my wittles or my life; in vain did I express my willingness to die upon the altar of that country, if necessary, and shed my hearts' blood with a perfect looseness. It was all no go; 'leave!' was the word, and leave I did. Ah, young feller! it would have did your soul good to have heard the howls of anguish, and seen the tears of sorrow, of my poor bereaved children, which was under my care, when I announced to them that I announced to them that I should be obliged to leave them to the care of a stranger; for I was a father and mother to them all, and they knew it. As a last token of my love, I flogged them all 'round; and left them bathed in tears. Ah! them beloved youngsters will never get another over-seer over them like me!" 
               "I don't think they will," remarked Jack, drily. "What did you do, after your removal from the office of overseer?" 
               "I went into the swearing business, replied Mr. Piggot, with an air of honest pride. 
               "The swearing business! what the devil is that?" 
               "Oh, it's very easy. When a feller got into trouble of any kind, and got into the jug, he had only to send for me, slip a five dollar bill into my hand, and then I'd go before the magistrate that committed him, and tail him out, by swearing that I was worth ten or twenty thousand dollars. That's what is called giving straw bail-it's almost as good as leg bail." 
                
               "But had you really any property?" 
               "Not a cent. People called such swearing, perjury; and I was finally compelled to abandon the business, through fear of getting into the State Prison." 
               "What did you do next?" 
               "Went into the mock auction business which paid very well for a short time, until the infernal police, which is always meddling with a man's bread and butter, came down on the game, and blocked it, by stationing fellers in front of all the mock auction shops, bearing a sort of a wooden banner, on which was painted, in large letters-'Beware of Mock Auctions!'" 
               "Then you are what is called a Peter Funk?" 
               "Yes. It was my duty to lounge around the auction room, and by bidding freely myself, encourage the green ones to bid. Every day I appeared in a different disguise-sometimes I was a farmer, sometimes a sailor, then again a marine, or a mechanic; and sometimes, but not often, I appeared in the character of a gentleman." 
               "That, I should think, was the most difficult part of them all for you to play." 
               "Ahem! Young feller, don't let the fact of my being in your debt to the extent of a quarter of a dollar, encourage you in the belief that I can be insulted with impunity. I'd have you to know that I was formerly a prominent New York politician, and--" 
               "There, I apologize for my remark," interrupted Jack, who was anxious to hear the remainder of Mr. Piggot's history-" proceed with your narration." 
               "When I could no longer assist in the disposal of brass rings and galvanized watches, I turned my attention to some other means of support. A feller of my genius didn't have to search a great while for employment. But my fortunes were on the decline, and the business that I next went into wasn't near so respectable as them which I had been following. I am almost ashamed to make the humiliating confession; my cheeks burn with shame while I state the fact; but I became--" 
               "What?" demanded Jack, eagerly. 
               "Reporter for a daily newspaper." replied Mr. Piggot, with a deep groan, and averting his face. 
               A brief pause ensued, and the exoverseer resumed-. 
               "Yes, I was installed as reporter for the 'Daily Dose and Diddler's Journal.' From that moment I lost all self-respect, and became what you now see me-a ruined, broken-hearted, and perfectly used-up man!" 
               Mr Piggot wept, wiped his eyes on his coat-sleeve, and continued his narration:- 
               "From morning till night I travelled about, collecting items for the 'Daily Dose.' When there was a scarcity of news, I manufactued it; often have I, on paper, perpetrated a murder, a rape, or a suicide, in order to procure the means of getting a dinner-a meal which was beginning to be very scarce with me. Ah, young feller! the many lies that I was obliged to tell, when I was a reporter, sit heavy on my conscience!" 
               The idea of Mr. Piggot's having a conscience was so particularly absurd, that Jack could not refrain from laughing. The ex-overseer proceeded:- 
               "Finally, my moral scruples got to be so strong, that I abandoned the profession in disgust; but I shall never forgive myself for having been guilty of such voluntary degradation, as to allow myself to become reporter for a daily paper'" 
               "What was your next business?" 
               "The drama, I went upon the stage." 
               "The devil you did!" 
               "Fact, upon my most sacred and unsullied honor. I became an obscure but useful member of the profession. I removed chairs and tables from the stage, and once, with singular success, personated the Dragon in a Christmas pantomime. Occasionally I bore a banner, or a spear-and all for the modest consideration of three dollars per week and the privilege of the negro gallery. I might have done well, but for one fatal, fatal circumstance." 
               "What was that, pray?" 
               "Young feller, the Demon Alcohol made me his victim. Three cent nippers was the cause of my ruin. One night, while playing the part of a Holy Father in the church, I fell down upon the stage dead drunk, and was carried off by a carpenter and the call-boy. I was conveyed home in a wheel-barrow, and the next day was dismissed from the theatre with startling abruptness;-in other words, I was kicked out by the stage manager." 
               And after that?" 
               I became a reformed drunkard, and lectured on temperance. But this didn't last long; the brethren soon discovered that I didn't drink liquor, but poured it down; and they hustled me out of their ranks. After this, I tried preaching and quack doctoring; but it was no go-I could get neither hearers nor patients. I very soon got to be out of money, out of credit and out at the elbows; in short-I blush not to own it, for poverty is no disgrace-I became a loafer of the seediest kind. One fine morning, after passing the night under a fish-stall in the Catharine Market, I made a light breakfast at one of the street pumps, and fell into deep meditation on my condition and prospects. It is plain, thought I, that merit such as mine ain't appreciated in New York; I'll go to Philadelphia, which may open a field for the exercise of my talents. So I stole a passage across the Hoboken ferry, took the turnpike road, and footed it to this city, begging my grub as I came along When I arrived here I couldn't find any opening for the display of my genius, and I have since been living, as the saying is, from hand to mouth.-Sometimes I have lodged at the establishment of Johnny Cox, and--" 
               "I have the pleasure of being slightly acquainted with that gentleman," interrupted Jack-"so you were one of his patrons?" 
               "Just so. New you see, young feller, the ungrateful and shameful manner in which I have been treated by this here city of Philadelphia; instead of taking me to its bosom and shoving me into some good office it violates every rule of hospitality and common politeness, by putting me in jail upon the absurd charge of purloining a leg of pork!" 
               Mr. Piggot here finished his 'strange eventful history;' and Jack thus addressed him- 
               "Piggot, I can scarcely wonder that you do not recollect me, for time has altered my appearance. I have good reason to remember you however; for your brutality to me, when I was an inmate of the Refuge and in your power, can never be forgotten. Can you not call to mind the name of Jack Harold?" 
               The ex-overseer gazed at our hero for a few moments with a bewildered expression of countenance; and then, rushing towards the former victim of his cruelty, as if to embrace him, he exclaimed- 
               "It is-it is the darling youth of my soul! Come to my arms, thou whom I have ever regarded with a father's love!" 
               Jack repulsed his affectionate friend with a movement indicative of disgust. The ardor of Mr. Piggot, however, was not to be thus extinguished. Producing a delapidated and very unclean pocket handkerchief, he began to dry his imaginary tears, and give vent to his agitated feelings. 
               "To think," said he-"of meeting my beloved young friend, after so long a separation, and under such circumstances! One also, that I was a father and mother to, and that was so ungrateful as to run away from me twice!" 
               "Take care how you stir up such recollections, villain!" cried Jack, sternly-"or I may be tempted to avail myself of this most excellent opportunity to repay you, in part, for your damnable cruelty to me, in former times. I still bear upon my person marks of the lash, inflicted upon me by you. Your present miserable situation is the just reward of your villainy; as it is, I scorn to take vengeance upon one so wretched and degraded." 
               Here the occupants of the other two beds, who were awake and had been listening to the foregoing conversation, signified their approval of Jack's remarks by a low chuckle of satisfaction; whereupon Mr. Piggot, enraged at the idea of their enjoying themselves at his expense, 'pitched into' the nearest lodger with the utmost ferocity; and as the lodger happened to be an elderly individual, of feeble frame, he would in all probability have received severe personal damage, had not Jack relieved him of his assailant, by knocking the latter down. As the ex-overseer fell, his head came in violent contact with the corner of an iron bed-stead; and he lay, stunned and bleeding, upon the floor. 
               At this moment, the door of the cell was thrown open by a turnkey, who beckoned our hero to come out. Jack obeyed, and having followed the official through a long and gloomy corridor, he was shown into a small cell about six feet square, containing nothing but a straw bed and a rude wooden bench. There was no window; and only a dim light was admitted through a small crevice in the iron door. 
               Jack shuddered as he entered this gloomy dungeon, which so much resembled a tomb. 
               "Here you are to remain," said the turnkey-"until your trial, which will come on soon, as the court is now sitting. They are only waiting until Captain Douglass gets well enough to testify against you. It will go hard with you, young man." 
               "But why am I placed in this infernal hole?" demanded Jack, indignantly-"why could I not remain where I was?" 
               "You are such a slippery chap," replied the turnkey, with agrin-"that we dare not trust you even in the Strong Room. Besides, it is too much indulgence for you to have company. Solitude, and bread and water, are necessary to bring you to a proper sense of your condition. You won't escape from this cell, my young friend." 
               "You are perfectly sure of that, I suppose?" said Jack, with the utmost indifference. 
               "Oh, I'll take my oath of it," rejoined the turnkey, with the air of a man who weighs his words, and is well satisfied of their correctness. 
               "We shall see," said our hero, as he threw himself upon the straw bed as if desirous of taking a nap. 
               The turnkey now took his departure, after having double locked the massive door. 
               Jack abandoned himself to feelings of the most profound despair. Hope had, for the time, entirely deserted him, and he might have said, in the words of Addison's Cato- 
                      
                        "Talk not of comfort-'tis for lighter ills;" 
                        I will indulge my sorrow, and give way 
                        To all the pangs and fury of despair" 
                     
                  
                
             
             
               CHAPTER VII. 
               JACK AND THE GAME. 
               Days passed away, and still Jack Harold remained the inmate of that gloomy dungeon. Twice every day did the turnkey make his appearance with the prisoner's allowance of bread and water, and, upon every such occasion, the petty official regarded our hero with a grin of triumph, as if to say-"Ah, ha! my fine fellow we've got you now!" 
               But, meanwhile, Jack was not idle. His natural buoyancy of spirits returned, and he set himself about forming some plan of escape from that dreary place, and from the consequences of his probable conviction. 
               As we before observed, there was no window; and, being without tools of any kind, it was impossible for him to operate upon the door. Therefore, he was obliged to resort to a plan of the most daring, desperate and dangerous character. 
               Pretending to be very ill, he kept his bed continually; and, whenever Gruff, the turnkey, came with his food, that gentleman was invariably saluted with a chorus of the most dismal groans from the prisoner, who seemed to be suffering all the agonies of the most dreadful sickness. 
               Mr. Gruff, being a gentleman of phlegmatic temperament, and rather hard-hearted withal, at first took no notice of these 'signals of distress;' but at length, fearing that the prisoner might die on his hands through neglect, he condescended to ask our hero what ailed him? 
               Jack, with many contortions, intimated that his bowels were in an awful state, in consequence of the unaccustomed coarseness of his diet; and concluded by expressing a fervent wish that he was dead and comfortably buried. 
               Mr. Gruff, firmly believing the prisoner to be dangerously unwell-and thinking, moreover, that his illness was entirely occasioned by the coarseness and insufficiency of his food-so far relaxed from the severity of the jail discipline as to furnish Jack with certain nourishing broths and light wines calculated to recruit his strength, from the same benevolent motive which induces a butcher to fatten a hog, preparatory to the slaughter of the ill-fated animal. 
               Although these savory viands were most welcome to our hero, in contrast with his usual fare of bread and water, the object which he had in view, in feigning sickness, was of far greater importance than the mere acquisition of wholesome and nourishing food, as we shall see presently. 
               Jack pretended to be too weak to arise in order to take his food; and therefore the unsuspecting turnkey would come to his bed-side and administer the same, with a care and patience which were alone prompted by a desire to get the prisoner into a fit condition to appear before the court, which was then in readiness to proceed with his trial, as Captain Douglass had recovered sufficiently to testify against him. 
               One dark and stormy afternoon, when he imagined that everything was ripe for the hazardous enterprise which he had in view, Jack leaped out of bed with a vigor and agility quite surprising on the part of a person affecting to be completely prostrated by sickness. Having assured himself that there was no spy peeping through the crevice in his door-for, since his confinement in that cell, he had more than once detected the sharp eyes of Mr. Gruff stealthily gazing in upon him-he rapidly divested himself of his clothing, which he had continued to wear both day and night, not choosing to bring his tender skin in contact with the rough and somewhat dirty blankets of his bed. Taking a couple of these blankets, he stuffed his clothes with them, thus forming a sort of effigy of himself. This figure he placed in the bed, threw a blanket over it in a careless manner, and then patiently awaited the arrival of the turnkey, with his evening repast. 
               Our hero had now no other garment on but his shirt; and, as the cell was both cold and damp, he soon began to suffer considerably; yet his stout heart, and the hope of achieving his liberty sustained him. 
               As evening came on, and the time for the turnkey's appearance drew nigh, the ordinary darkness of the cell increased, and every object within it was enveloped in a dim obscurity most favorable to the prisoner's hopes. 
               At length Jack heard the heavy tread of his jailor approaching; and, with a beating heart, he crouched down in a dark corner nearest to the door. 
               The key rattled in the lock; the heavy bolts flew back, and the massive door swung open upon its iron hinges. 
               The turnkey entered, and, as usual, approached the prisoner's bed. 
               Jack glided out of the cell as noiselessly as a cat. 
               "Come, young fellow, rouse up; here's your supper," said Mr. Gruff, as be gently shook the figure in the bed. 
               Quick as lightning, Jack closed the cell door and turned the key, which had been left in the lock. 
               Mr. Gruff gave utterance to a fearful oath, for he instantly saw the trick which had been played upon him.-Dragging the image from the bed, he bestowed upon it a tremendous kick, as if to chastise it for its having assisted to deceive him. Then, well knowing the futility of attempting to force open the door, he made the cell resound with loud cries of-"A prisoner escaped! stop him! stop him!" 
               Fortunately for Jack, the cell was in a corner of the jail so very remote, that there was but little probability of the turnkey's cries being heard by those for whose ears they were uttered. 
               Running swiftly along the corridor, our hero soon came to the great door which guarded it. This door, having been left open by the turnkey, proved no obstacle in the way of Jack, who now found himself standing in the jail vard, an area of considerable extent, surrounded by a stone wall of great height. 
               A cold and drizzling rain was falling; and, as the young Outlaw was in almost an entire state of nudity, it is easy to conceive that his situation was far from comfortable. Besides he knew that even should he succeed in scaling the wall and gaining the street beyond, his nakedness would expose him to the fearful risk of being re-captured and returned to his old quarters-a catastrophe which he naturally contemplated with the utmost horror. If Richard was willing to give his "kingdom for a horse," Jack, in his present emergency, would most assuredly have thanked propitious fortune for the temporary loan of a pair of breeches. 
               Although shivering with cold, and drenched to the skin, hope did not abandon him; on the contrary, his courage and capacity seemed to expand, in proportion to the critical nature of his position. 
               While groping about in the profound darkness, endeavoring to devise some means of getting over that that formidable wall, which, towering above him, seemed like an impassable barrier between him and liberty, he stumbled against a huge ladder which had been left in an upright position against the jail, by some workmen who had been engaged in making certain repairs and alterations upon the roof of the building. 
               Imagine with what transports of joy he discovered this means of escape from his dangerous situation! His feelings at that moment resembled those of the ship-wrecked mariner, who, from the barren and desolate rock upon which he has been cast, sees for the first time an approaching sail, and cherishes the blessed hope of being rescued from an awful, lingering death by famine. 
               To mount this ladder was but the work of a few moments; and Jack stood upon the flat roof of the jail. 
                
               Upon one side of this building, as the reader is aware, was situated the house inhabited by Captain Douglass, the head jailor. On the other side, and immediately adjoining, was a large and handsome edifice, occupied by a wealthy and aristocratic family. 
               To pass from the jail to the roof of its more agreeable neighbor, was a very easy matter, both buildings being of precisely the same height. 
               Without much difficulty, Jack managed to effect an entrance into the rich man's house, through a cupola which adorned its summit. Descending cautiously, and in the midst of the deepest darkness, he finally groped his way into an apartment which seemed to be a bed-chamber. 
               The means by which our hero had gained access to this house, irresistibly reminded him of his mode of entrance to the residence of the jailor, upon the occasion of his former escape; and he could not forbear breathing a fervent hope that his present daring enterprise, unlike the other, might be unattended with bloodshed. Since his interview with his mother, under the extraordinary circumstances detailed in a former chapter, we will do him the justice to say that he had formed a resolution to abandon forever his course of crime; in this determination he was perfectly honest and sincere, but his dark and relentless fate seemed to be bent upon his ruin and destruction, notwithstanding the strong desire of his soul to reform. 
                      
                        "Fate is above us all; 
                        We struggle, but what matters our endeavor? 
                        Our doom is gone beyond our own recall; 
                        May we deny or mitigate it?-Never!" 
                     
                  
                
             
             
               CHAPTER VIII. 
               THE LADY AND HER ANXIOUS PHYSICIAN. 
               That the apartment into which Jack had managed to grope his way, was furnished with extreme luxury was evident; for his feet pressed a carpet of extraordinary thickness and softness, and his extended arms came in contact with various articles of furniture which he knew to be of a magnificent and costly description. 
               To secure suitable clothing, and then depart unnoticed from the house, was now his great object. 
               To accomplish this, he began to search about for the entrance to a closet or dressing-room in which clothing was likely to be kept. 
               This search was successful. He soon discovered a door, and opening it, he entered a room around the walls of which was suspended a profusion of garments. These appeared to be of an elegant and fashionable kind-but, unfortunately, they were all the garments of a lady; not a single article of male wearing apparel was to be found. 
               Under these circumstances, Jack resolved to sustain a female character until such time as he could procure clothes more appropriate to his sex. Accordingly, he was proceeding as best he could in the darkness, to array himself as one of the fairer portion of creation, when he heard the sound of approaching footsteps. In great consternation, he hastily closed the door of the dressing-room, and awaited the result with the most intense anxiety. As this door was of glass, screened by a curtain drawn partially aside, he was enabled to witness whatever might transpire in the adjoining bed-chamber. 
               A gleam of light now shone into this chamber, proceeding from a wax candle held by a lady, who entered with a quick and elastic step. She was followed by a gentleman, who carefully turned the key in the door. His nervous and agitated manner seemed to announce a degree of eager delight, in which the lady shared, although there was visible in her looks a shade of hesitation and fear. 
               Having placed the light upon the table ble, the lady threw herself upon a sofa, and the gentleman seated himself at her side. 
               Jack had now an opportunity of taking a hasty survey of the chamber. We will not inflict upon the reader a tedious and detailed description of the place, for such an account would be neither necessary nor desirable; suffice it to say that every article contained in that splendid apartment was a perfect gem of luxury and art-every rare and beautiful thing was there which could be procured by unbounded wealth, or suggested by the most refined taste. The low and voluptuous French bed, with its magnificent counterpane of white satin embroidered with flowers, and its cloud of overhanging drapery of spotless hue and most charming delicacy of texture-that couch, worthy the soft slumbers of a fairy, particularly attracted our hero's admiring gaze. It reminded him of the theatre of love's joys, wherein he and Kate had in former times passed so many hours engaged in soft and amorous dalliance. That recollection, even then, caused his pulses to throb and his blood to boil. Yet, when he thought of Kate's desertion, this excitement subsided, to give place to feelings of rage. 
               By way of improving his time, and availing himself of the light which now shone into the dressing-room, Jack continued with noiseless haste to array himself in dainty female attire, taking care to select the most costly and elegant garments. He was sufficiently well versed in all the divine mysteries of a lady's toilet to perform his task with a tolerable degree of accuracy and case. 
               While thus engaged, however, he stole frequent glances into the chamber for the purpose of watching the progress of the lady and gentleman; while not a single word which they uttered, escaped his ears. 
               We have become so weary or describing the charms of the actresses of our drama, that in the present instances we shall merely observe that this lady was a remarkably fine-looking woman young and voluptuous in the extreme. Yet her rather coarse mouth expressed sensuality, while her bold and wanton eyes amply confirmed that expression. Her companion had a decidedly professional air; he was a gentleman of middle age, and rejoiced in a very respectable reputation as a fashionable physician. 
               By listening to the conversation of these parties, we may perhaps be enabled to judge of the relations existing between them. 
               Dr. Chatelle-for such was the name of the medical gentleman-contemplated his beautiful companion with an enamoured gaze; while she, either feeling or affecting embarrassment, began to trace numerous intricate figures upon the rich carpet, with the point of her delicate satin slipper. 
               Whatever might then have been the wishes and intentions of this pair, it was evident that they had never before met in secret; for their actions betrayed that timidity which is perhaps inseparable from a first amour.
                
               The lady was the first to break the silence, which was beginning to be rather awkward:- 
               "Dr. Chatelle will perhaps deign to inform me why he has requested a private interview?" 
               "Does that request excite within you emotions either of displeasure or surprise?" demanded the physician, respectfully, but in a slightly reproachful tone. 
               "I confess that I am somewhat surprised. Why could not this interview take place as well in the presence of my husband, as in my chamber? Is it proper for us to be alone-and here?" 
               "Undoubtedly. I am your family physician, and any intercourse between us, under all circumstances, is sacred. My position-our relative situations-will admit of the most unbounded privacy vacy between us, without the slightest infringement of propriety." 
               "But, granting all this-why have you summoned me here?" 
               "I wish to have a private and confidential conversation with you. I am interested in your welfare. You are unhappy." 
               The lady sighed. The doctor continued:- 
               "How can you be otherwise than unhappy, my dear Mrs. Delaplaine, united as you are to a man old enough to be your grandfather-an old dotard, whose filthy gold purchased your divine person from mercenary parents."
                
               "You are severe, sir." 
               "I speak the truth, madame, and you know it," rejoined the doctor, who, being a man of the world, hoped that a little specious argument would gain his point. He recollected the proverb-"the woman who hesitates, is lost." 
               The physician proceeded:- 
               "Your husband, my dear Mrs. Delaplaine-your nominal husband, I should say, for he cannot be your husband in fact-is an aged and impotent man, worn out by the excesses of his youth. He is afflicted with various diseases, among which is that fashionable and excrutiating malady, the gout. These render him cross, peevish, exacting, troublesome, and eminently disagreeable. Your time is consumed by your attendance upon his whims; you are the constant object of his ill humor. Nor is this all: he has become habitually intemperate in the use of wine, and even now, propped up in his easy chair in the drawing-room below, he is sleeping off the effects of a protracted sitting after dinn er, as it is called." 
               "Alas! sir, it is true," sighed the lady. 
               "How can such a man contribute to the happiness or enjoyment of a woman like you, gifted by nature with the most tender sensibility, the most ardent passions, and the most abundant capacity for unlimited indulgence in the ineffable delights of matrimony-those joys to which you are an utter stranger, in consequence of your unnatural connection with this odious and imbecile old wretch?" 
               The costly lace which covered the lady's well-developed bosom, was agitated by the profound sigh elicited by the doctor's artful and exciting words 
               The physician saw that he was making rapid progress towards the consummation of his wishes, and continued, with enthusiasm- 
               "I plainly perceive, my dear madam, that your health is seriously affected by your unhappy position-a wife, without a husband. The most deplorable consequences invariably result from nature's unsatisfied longings. The glitter of your eyes, and the deep glow upon your cheeks, although they enhance your beauty, betray an unhealthy fever in your blood. It was in order to consult you in regard to this most important matter, that I ventured to demand a private interview-for the subject is of too much delicacy to discuss in the presence of others." 
               Mrs. Delaplaine bowed, and averted her head in order to conceal the burning blushes which suffused her cheeks. Dr. Chatelle said- 
               "Suffer me to examine your pulse." 
               She extended her white and jewelled hand, and the fingers of the physician toyed amorously with the beautiful wrist. This contact thrilled through both their frames like an electric shock. 
               "Ah, madam," said the doctor-"this pulse beats far too rapidly, and requires to be moderated. You are in a far more critical state than I had imagined. Ha! you seem to breathe with difficulty; can it be possible that your chest or lungs, is affected? Allow me-professionally, you know--" 
               The doctor's hand gently-almost imperceptibly-glided up that soft and naked arm, and insinuated itself beneath the gauze-like covering of that luxurious bust. There it remained. 
               Meanwhile, Jack Harold-who had lost none of the details of the foregoing scene, which he enjoyed hugely-had completed his toilet, and was now ready to take his departure as soon as the lady and her anxious physician should vacate the bed-chamber. 
               And now the parties, enfolded in a close embrace, began to exchange the most passionate kisses. These were soon followed by still more ardent demonstrations; the doctor whispered in the lady's ear, and the pair disappeared behind the snowy drapery which veiled that voluptuous couch. 
                
             
             
               CHAPTER IX. 
               THE AGED HUSBAND AND THE YOUNG WIFE. 
               An hour passed, during which our hero suffered all the agonies of an extreme impatience to depart, to say nothing of the mad excitement of feeling created by his reflections concerning the manner in which the lady and the doctor were employed. 
               At the expiration of that hour, the amiable pair made their appearance-the estimable Mrs. Delaplaine much flushed in face and disordered in attire, while the countenance of the respectable Dr. Chatelle wore an expression of triumph. 
               The lady re-arranged her ruffled plumage at the mirror, and then prepared to accompany her gallant down stairs. 
               The doctor bestowed upon her an affectionate kiss, and whispered- 
               "Henceforth, dearest, we must seek many such golden opportunities." 
               "I am wholly yours," was the murmured response of the lady, as she abandoned herself to the embrace of her lover with an air which bespoke a feeling of languid voluptuousness. 
               In a few moments they quitted the chamber, carrying with them the light. 
               Jack now cautiously issued from the dressing-room, and having groped his way to the door of the chamber, passed out, and cautiously descended the stairs leading to the principal hall of entrance. 
               One of the doors communicating with this hall was slightly ajar. Urged by an invincible spirit of curiosity, notwithstanding the dangers of his situation, Jack paused at this door and stealthily gazed into the apartment. 
               Two persons were there-the beautiful but frail Mrs. Delaplaine, and her aged invalid husband, the millionaire. The fortunate Dr. Chatelle had discreetly taken his departure. 
               The lady was seated at a distance from her "liege lord," and seemed to be occupied with thoughts that were both novel and pleasing. 
               Old Delaplaine was reposing in a large easy chair. He was propped up with pillows, and his gouty foot, of enormous dimensions, rested upon a cushioned foot-stool. He was a shrivelled, grey-haired old man of seventy, with a countenance expressive of great ill humor and irritability, though flushed with the rosy hue of wine. 
               Suddenly, this old man seemed to awaken from an uneasy slumber, and in a sharp, petulant voice he exclaimed- 
               "Julia! where are you, Julia?" 
               "I am here," said the lady, rising and coming towards him. 
               "Curses on my head! it will burst asunder with pain. Give me some drink, for I am parched with thirst. Million devils! can't you move more quickly?" 
               Mrs. Delaplaine poured out a bumper of choice Burgundy, and presented it to her husband, who drank eagerly. 
               The delicious beverage refreshed the old wretch, and imparted a temporary warmth to his icy blood; for he encircled his wife's beautiful waist with his withered arms, and said, or rather croaked-while his ugly old face assumed an amorous expression that was absolutely disgusting- 
               "Ah, ha! July! you look lovely as an angel to-night; and you are all my own-mine, mine! How many a young buck, now-yes, young and handsome, too, who would laugh at the old man-how many such, I say, would give their right hands to be allowed to clasp this delicious waist, as I do now! But you wouldn't let them, would you-hey? You'd scorn, them, July, if they wanted you to prove unfaithful to your old man, wouldn't you-hey?" 
               "Certainly," murmured the lady, with difficulty concealing her strong disgust. Old Delaplaine patted her on the back with a sort of feeble, lazy rapture. 
               "Good girl-good girl!" croaked he-"I only wish that I was-just-a little younger, say a year or two. Not that I'm old now; by no means. I'm just in the prime of life, as one might say. I have many years to live yet; so you mustn't expect to be left a rich young widow very soon, my dear. I haven't the least intention of dying. With the exception of this accursed gout, I'm well enough. Yet I wish that I was a very little younger, for both our sakes. Ah, well, well; you're very pretty, July; kiss me." 
               The lady, almost shudderingly, pressed her ripe, moist lips to his withered cheek, to the great delight of the old dotard, who continued to talk on:- 
               "Ah, ha! many a young man would give a thousand dollars for that sweet kiss; but you would'nt sell a kiss, for love or money, would you, July-hey? No one shall kiss you, except me; shall they, hey? Many young gallants-handsome fellows, too-were after you; I know it; but I bore off the prize, in spite of them all. My money bought you of your poor, miserable devil of a father, who hadn't a copper-hey? You're wholly mine, because I've paid for you-ha, ha, ha!" 
               It was a horrid laugh. Mrs. Delaplaine's fine eyes blazed with indignation at the brutality of the speech; and the angry reply which she would have made was alone restrained by the reflection that her amour with Dr. Chatelle amply revenged the insults of the old wretch. She now blamed herself for not having sooner engaged in an intrigue as an agreeable and much-desired solace for the misery of her matrimonial condition, united as she was, by the terms of a mercenary marriage, to an impotent, petulant and abusive old man. 
               Surely, under such circumstances, there is some excuse for a woman when she is tempted to go astray by a man possessing every desirable qualification in which her "husband" is lamentably deficient? We believe that the generality of women prefer to be the "slaves" of young men, (in a certain sense,) rather than the "darlings" of impotent old dotards. 
               A sudden shriek of agony, arising from the lips of old Delaplaine, alarmed the lady, and even started Jack, who was an invisible spectator or the foregoing scene. An intensely painful twinge of the gout had caused this cry of torture. 
               As usual with him in such cases, the chivalrous Mr. Delaplaine-who was, and always had been, a prodigiously mean man, in every sense of the word, vented his anger and spleen upon the head of his young wife. 
               "Curse you!" he cried, with concentrated rage, as he attempted to strike her-"hussy! wretch! you have trod upon my gouty foot! Go-go; leave me; you are hateful in my sight. You are no companion for me; you are a wretch-a prostitute, for what I know!" 
               The lady could restrain herself no longer; her indignation rendered her superb y beautiful, as she exclaimed, in thrilling tones:- 
               "And if I am a prostitute, does not your brutality, your impotence, and your disgusting person, justify in me a departure from virtue's course?-It is time that we should understand each other; know, then, miserable old man! that I loathe the very sight of you-the very atmosphere which you breathe seems pestilential to me! Nay, more than this-since you have aroused me to make the confession-know that I have already, this very night, sweetly avenged my wrongs by indulging in a delicious amour with a young, handsome and accomplished man. Yes! a man, who deserves that proud title, and whose person, compared with yours, is as the gallant eagle contrasted with the unclean vulture! Yes, within an hour-in this house-in my bed-chamber-have I and my gallant lover--" 
               She paused, for a sudden and frightful change was visible in the old man's face. Jealousy and rage had produced an awful effect upon that feeble frame, broken down by old age, disease and excessive indulgences. His tongue was powerless to give utterance to the tempest of wrath which swelled within him. His eyes seemed to be starting from their sockets, and the rushing blood caused his countenance to assume an almost sable hue. Tossing his arms wildly, as if clutching at the intangible air, he at length gave utterance to a deep groan, and fell forward upon the carpet. On partially raising him up, the lady discovered that he was dead. Apoplexy had claimed him as its victim. 
               Although Mrs. Delaplaine cordially detested her aged husband, his sudden and awful death inspired her with such feelings of horror, that she swooned.-Jack, who ever had an eye to business, took advantage of this circumstance to glide into the room for the purpose of appropriating to his own use such articles as might tend to the replenishing of his purse. From the body of the old man he took a valuable gold watch and a well-filled wallet; and then, from the tempting lips of the unconscious lady, he stole an amorous kiss-for the incorrigible young dog could not restrain the ardent propensities excited by the lady's beauty, even in the presence of death. There is no telling how much further he might have gone, had he not been startled by the abrupt entrance of one of the servants; a very pretty and buxom lass, who almost screamed with astonishment when she beheld the extraordinary group. 
               Jack, with his usual presence of mind, remembered that he was in female costume, which, by the way, became him singularly well, on account of his fine form and the delicate beauty of his countenance. 
               Assuming an air of dignity, and an effeminate voice, he approached the astonished servant maid and said- 
               "Do not be at all alarmed, my good girl; your master has only fallen in a fit, and Mrs. Delaplaine has swooned. I was merely paying them an evening visit, being an old friend and school-fellow of the lady. Do what you can to revive them both; and, meanwhile, I had perhaps better go for a physician. Have the kindness to show me out of the house." 
               Completely deceived by the air of perfect nonchalance assumed by our hero, the servant obeyed, and Jack found himself in the open street, dressed in female attire, and with the rain pouring upon him in torrents. 
             
             
               CHAPTER X. 
               A STRANGE ADVENTURE. 
               "Devilish pleasant!" muttered the young Outlaw, as he threaded his way through the wet and almost deserted streets-"here am I, dressed as a lady of high fashion, wandering I know not where, and liable to be insulted, and perhaps outraged-ahem!-by any lustful ruffian with whom I may chance to come in contact. Confusion! how it rains' My silk and satin finery will be completely spoiled; and this "love of a Parisian bonnet," which has so often shrouded the fine eyes of the beautiful Mrs. Delaplaine, is already ruined past all redemption. How gladly would I exchange these splendid garments for the coarsest description of male clothing! However, I am free, and must trust to luck for the rest.-As for the matter of funds, I am in a tolerably flourishing condition; and if I am so fortunate as to escape the vigilence of inquisitive Charleys-the whole race of whom may the devil confound-then is 'Richard himself again!'" 
               Thus mentally soliloquizing, Jack hurried onwards, with the intention of seeking lodgings at some humble tavern, in the character of a "female in distress," trusting to his own ingenuity for the manufacture of a plausible story in explanation of his situation. It suddenly occurred to him that the "Red Ball Tavern" of Mr. Cox might, under the circumstances, afford him a safe temporary place of refuge, where he could easily procure male clothing. Therefore, notwithstanding the strong feelings of repugnance which he entertained towards that far from respectable establishment-to which he had been once introduced by his deceased friend the Ribber-he proceeded in that direction, for he felt that he had no other alternative. 
               To his great satisfaction, the rain had now entirely ceased, and the dim rays of the incon began to struggle feebly through the clouds which had so long obscured her surface. 
               While tripping lightly along, with all the grace appropriate to his assumed character, and highly elated at having regained his liberty Jack was so unfortunate as to encounter a party of half-drunken rowdies, who were making night hideous with their yells and snatches of bacchanalian songs. 
               An unprotected female, in the streets of Philadelphia, at night, who may chance to fall into the hands of any of the ruffians who are continually prowling about, need expect no mercy at their hands. Insult, violence and outrage are the three words which express the sort of treatment she is destined to receive. Even the company of a male friend is no adequate protection for her; the gentleman is perhaps beaten until he is senseless, after which the unfortunate lady is subjected to usage still more brutal and fiend-like. Upon such occasions, the frantic shrieks of the poor victim very rarely brings any one to her assistance. As to the valiant city watch, they generally take good care to remove themselves to a safe distance from the scene of outrage, not wishing to come in contact with a class of miscreants whose desperate character is proverbial throughout the whole Union. 
                      
                        "Suing to these men were as the bleating 
                        Of the lamb to the butcher, or the cry 
                        Of seamen to the surge." 
                     
                  
                
               Jack Harold was well aware of all this; and, although in reality he was no "unprotected female," yet as he appeared in the character of one, and was very desirous of preserving his secret, no wonder that his meeting with these midnight gentry created within him considerable alarm. 
               Hoping to escape their notice, he glided into a dark passage-way, intending there to remain until they should have passed. 
               But, alas! they had seen the flutter of a lady's dress and, like bloodhounds on the scen of a fugitive, they rushed after our hero. 
               Their leader-a singularly repulsive looking villain, with red hair-seized the supposed lady with an iron grass and exclaimed, with many oaths- 
                
               "We've caught the bird, by G-! She's fair game, and good picking; look at her plumage-silk and satin, or I'm a liar! One of the upper crust night-walkers, I suppose. This dark alley is the very place for us; and remember, fellers, I am first. Now, Miss Highflyer, or whoever else you may be, please to keep your mouth shut, or you you'll get your head caved in, that's all!" 
               Jack instantly recognized the voice of Carrotty Tom the locksmith-the fellow who had betrayed him and his companion the Ribber, in the affair of the bank robbery. Although, upon that occasion, Tom had been dangerously injured, he had recovered, probably in order that he might grace a halter at some future time; and he had resumed his villainous career, notwithstanding that he was a coward of the most despicable description; never venturing abroad unless with a crowd at his heels, and seldom daring to molest any except defenceless women. 
               On making this discovery, Jack's blood boiled with rage, and had he possessed a weapon, he would have slain the villain upon the spot. 
               With many a fierce oath and threatening gesture, this gang of ruffians gathered close around our hero, who, notwithstanding the dangers of his situation, could scarcely refrain from laughing at the oddity of the adventure. He determined, if possible, to put an end to the affair at once, more especially as Carrotty Tom had begun to make certain familiar investigations which may better be imagined than described. 
               Judge, therefore, the astonishment of the last-named gentleman, upon receiving from the supposed female a kick in the stomach of such precision and vigor, that his internal arrangements were seriously disturbed, and he fell back senseless into the arms of his companions. 
               It was now a matter of life and death with Jack to escape from the hands of his enemies. His way to the street being intercepted, he took advantage of the temporary confusion of the rowdies to run rapidly up the passage, trusting to find some other outlet. It being intensely dark, he ran with some violence aginst a door, which yielded to the shock and flew open. The fugitive rushed in, and quickly succeeded in securing the door by means of a stout bolt. 
               The rowdies, who had hotly pursued our hero, now found themselves completely baffled; and although they thundered and kicked against the door, its strength defied all their efforts, and they failed in effecting an entrance.-The noise attracted a small party of the city police to the spot, and these officers-more vigilant, courageous and efficient than the watch-soon dispersed the ruffianly crew, who imagined themselves cheated of a delicate morsel of female loveliness. They went off cursing and swearing; but none cursed or swore louder than Carrotty Tom, whose digestive organs had received the most severe injury. 
               We now return to Jack. The door through which he had passed, just in time to "save his bacon," led into a small garden, situated in the rear of a house of modest but respectable appearance. The tremendous noise made by the rowdies was overheard by the only inmate of this mansion, who was a middle-aged widow lady in comfortable circumstances, and of the most unblemished reputation. 
               Alarmed at the unusual disturbance in the immediate vicinity of her quiet domicil, and wishing to ascertain the cause thereof, this amiable lady-upon whom her late husband had bestowed the very uncommon name of Smith-appeared at the threshold of her door, bearing a light. The first object that met her astonished gaze was a drooping figure arrayed in elegant but disordered female attire, and having the appearance of a beautiful young lady. 
               'Who are you, miss, and how came you in my garden?" demanded the worthy Mrs. Smith, in great astonishment. 
               "Pardon me, madam, for my intrusion," replied the stranger, in a feminine and very musical voice-"I fled hither to escape from the insults of a party of ruffians whom I encountered in the street. If you will but have the kindness to afford me a temporary shelter, I will explain everything to your entire satisfaction." 
               Mrs. Smith was a woman, and a very kind one at that; how could she, then, resist such a touching appeal from one of her own sex,(!) uttered in accents the most melodious and refined? 
               "Come in, poor creature," said she "your misfortune is a direct passport to my heart and hearth. You shall be cordially welcome to such hospitalities as my unpretending home may afford. Even if you are frail, you are none the less a sister, and entitled to a woman's sympathy. Come in, my dear girl, and I will do what I can to make you comfortable." 
               These kind words were uttered in a tone of such genuine benevolence, that the disguised young Outlaw was deeply affected, and hesitated a few moments ere he made up his mind to accept the good lady's offer. Should he, a fugitive from justice, branded with crime, and fresh from a felon's cell-should he take advantage of that excellent woman's unsuspecting kindness of heart, and intrude his polluted presence into her pure abode? And yet there was no other alternative; therefore, overcoming his scruples, be briefly expressed his gratitude, which was really sincere; and, remembering that he was now to play his assumed part before the experienced eyes of a female, he determined to bring into play all the grace and art of which he was so abundantly possessed in order that the lady might not suspect his true sex. 
               Mrs. Smith, with many expressions of sympathy and condolence, conducted the disguised robber into a small apartment which was furnished with taste and even elegance. The most exquisite neatness and order prevailed; and upon the hearth cracked a cheerful wood fire, for the night was damp and cold. Everything was exceedingly cozy and sung, indicating the comfortable circumstances of the blooming widow, and her desire to enjoy the good things of this world to their fullest extent. 
               Jack seated himself in a luxurious arm chair before the fire, while the lady busied herself in preparing refreshments for her interesting stranger guest. Our hero had now for the first time an opportunity of scrutinizing the personal appearance of his hospitable hostess; and he was surprised to find that she was a very handsome and attractive woman-for he had expected to behold nothing less than an ugly old widow, or a superannuated old maid 
               Mrs. Smith was "fat, fair, and"-not "forty;" for her age still lingered within the ripened precincts of thirty-five, the glowing summer of female life, in very many cases. Nay, we have seen women in the autumn of life-forty-far more voluptuously beautiful than many of the delicate and undeveloped flowers of girlhood. But, alas! those well-preserved specimens are rare. Family cares and duties inordinate vanity, and tight lacing, play the very devil with the women of the present day. Mrs. Smith, then, was thirty-five. We said she was "fat;" but the word is odious and vulgar, and we retract it. Infernal word! which always brings to us visions of Falstaff, apoplexy and hogs lard! The expression must have been invented by some malignant pork butcher. Let our modern lexicographers at once and forever expunge it from all the dictionaries-it pollutes the English vocabulary-it smells rank, and fishy! It gives to the sensitive stomach a villainous twinge; and oh! breathe it not into the ear of him who is afflicted with sea-sickness!-Say obese-corpulent-anything; but not fat! Certain students of Shakspeare assert that Hamlet was fat; but a million Princes of Denmark, inky cloaks and all, could never render the word classical. 
               The shape of Mrs. Smith-what a name for a heroine!-was decidedly buxom; you might have spannd her waist with your aim, but then that arm would be rather inconveniently full, though not unpleasantly so; for what the devil can there be unpleasant in clasping the well-formed waist of a pretty woman, though she be as fat--we mean, as plump, as Mr. Daniel Lambert himself? 
               Buxom, then, was Mrs. Smith in shape, and fair in complexion, with a skin as soft and smooth as satin; so, at least, her late husband was wont to declare over his fourth tumbler of punch-and he, of course, was an excellent authority on that subject. 
               The liberality of nature towards Mrs. Smith enabled her to dispense entirely with many bustling appendages which ladies too frequently affect. No cotton padding was needed to impart to her bust a luxurious swell; all was firm, and genuine, and particularly recherche. Nature had to her been very generous indeed. 
               Her face was unexceptionable; eyes, teeth, lips, cheeks, nose and hair, all united to form one of the most charming countenances in the world. Her smile was witchery itself-her voice the essence of all music. Byron himself would have been in raptures with the smallness, whiteness and delicacy of her hands, which were unadorned save by a single plain mourning ring. She was dressed with all the modesty simplicity and elegance which became her years, circumstances and position. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XI. 
               JACK'S ROMANCE. 
               Such was Mrs. Rosalia Smith, the widow of a moderately wealthy merchant-a woman possessing beauty without vanity, wit without malice, a winning manner without coquetry, amiability without affectation, and true benevolence without the slightest particle of ostentation. 
               This good lady, having prepared a light but excellent repast, invited our hero to partake thereof. Jack, being very hungry, did not require a second bidding, but did full justice to the meal. At its termination, he cast his eyes upon the carpet with an air of modest diffidence, and said:- 
               "In return for your kindness, madam, it is but just that I should state, freely and unreservedly, all the particulars of my situation, and explain the cirucmstances under which I was compelled to intrude into your garden tonight, and solicit a temporary shelter in your hospitable abode." 
               "I wish to extort no confessions from you, my dear young lady," said Mrs. Smith, with a smile of ineffable sweetness-" for your appearance fully assures me that you are not one of the fallen sisterhosd, as I was at first inclined to suspect. However, if you choose to give me your confidence, I shall be much pleased to listen to your story." 
               Jack's powers of imagination were quite equal to those of a modern novelist; and he had therefore but little difficulty in "making up" the following romance, which he delivered with an air of ingenuousness that seemed to bear the impress of truth: 
               "My story, madam, is short and simple, and its relation will detain you but a few minutes. I am the only daughter of a gentleman occupying a respectable position in a government office at Washington. My mother died a year ago; and, since the death of that dearest, best of friends, I have been indeed alone in the world.--Madam, excuse these tears, and pity my weakness; would that I were with my angel mother, in Heaven!" 
               "Take comfort, my dear young lady," said the sympathizing Mrs. Smith-"and pour your sorrows into the bosom of a friend. Your words, no less than your appearance, have inspired me with interest. Regard me in the light of a mother, my child." 
               As Jack looked at the amiable and beautiful woman, so full of quiet elegance and soft voluptuousness, he thought that he had much rather take her as a mistress, than as a mother.-He continued:- 
               "My father is one of the most worldly of men, ambitious to attain political distinction, and very desirous of accumulating wealth. Affection for his only child has no place in his cold and mercenary breast. So far from treating me with tenderness, he exhibits towards me the utmost harshness and severity." 
               "Poor, unhappy child!" murmured Mrs. Smith; and, overcome with sympathy for a young lady so unfortunate, she folded the interesting stranger to her bosom. 
               Encircled by her warm and loving arms, and with a pair of luscious lips pressed affectionately to his, Jack could with difficulty refrain from abandoning himself to the intoxicating feelings which his exciting situation naturally aroused. However, he controlled himself by a powerful effort, and resumed his fanciful narration:- 
               "A few months ago, an elderly gentleman, high in station and renown, whose fame as a statesman is tarnished by the abundance of his private vices, was introduced to me at a fashionable party; he is a widower, and immediately began to persecute me with his addresses. I at once, and with decision, rejected his suit; for I had involuntarily conceived towards him a strong dislike, and determined never to be his. Still he persisted; and finally, seeing that I would not listen to his proposals, he appealed to my father, who immediately espoused his cause, and demanded of me, with an air of almost savage indignation, what I meant by refusing to marry so distinguished and wealthy a man as the Hon. gentleman, who was in every respect a most desirable match for me' I replied that the man, besides being of an unsuitable age, was personally repulsive to me; and therefore that I never should consent to become his wife." 
               "Courageous girl!" exclaimed Mrs. Smith, whose womanly instincts caused her to be deeply interested in this tale of the imagination. Our hero continued:- 
               "Enraged at this avowal of my resolution not to comply with his wishes, my father abused me in the most cruel manner, and emphatically declared that I should be forced into obedience. I replied only by a scornful smile, which rendered him furious, and he so far forget himself as to descend to personal violence towards me, his own child. Yes-that unnatural parent raised his arm, and struck me senseless to the floor!" 
               Jack-artful dog!-purposely introduced this tragic clause in order still more to excite Mrs. Smith's sympathy, and elicit from her another affectionate maternal caress-a stroke of policy which proved eminently successful; again was he fondly pressed to that luxurious bosom, and again did he taste the nectar of those rosy lips, which breathed words of tender condolence. 
               "When I recovered from the effects of this violence," continued the pretended young lady in distress,-"I found myself locked up in my chamber. A message soon reached me from my father, to the effect that he had fixed the date of my marriage with the Hon. Mr. --, at exactly one month from that day, at which time he was determined that I should be united with the object of his choice, even if I had to be dragged to the altar. Meanwhile, I was to be kept closely confined in my chamber, and allowed to see no one whatever except a cross old woman who was to bring me my meals. 
               "Conceive, dearest madam, the horrors of my situation! A prisoner in the house of a cruel father-excluded from all sympathy, without a friend, and forced to contemplate the possibility of my union with a man whom I detested! 
               "Alas! then did I feel most poignantly the loss of that tender and most excellent mother, whose influence might have shielded me from the evils with which I was threatened, and whose breast would have pillowed my aching head." 
               By way of illustrating the manner in which the imaginary mother would have "pillowed his aching head," our audacious young rascal reclined upon the bosom of his beautiful listener, and remained in that very comfortable situation. 
               Mrs. Smith entreated him to proceed, and he obeyed:- 
               "Fired with indignation by the cruel and arbitrary treatment of my father, I determined to flee from a roof which was no longer a home for me, and trust rather to the cold charity of the world than to the protection of a harsh and unnatural parent. Not to weary you, madam, with unnecessary details, I will merely say that I succeeded in making my escape; and having come to this city, I sought a temporary home at the abode of a distant female relative of my mother's. This relative received me with kindness, and strongly urged me to remain with her permanently. Beneath her hospitable roof I might have enjoyed that happiness to which I have so long been a stranger, had not my relentless fate decreed it otherwise." 
               "What new calamity overtook you, my poor girl?" asked Mrs. Smith, kindly. 
               "A very great calamity, in the shape of my cruel father, who, suspecting my place of refuge, arrived here this evening, from Washington. Two hours ago, while seated in the comfortable parlor of Mrs. Frederickson-my mother's relative-I was frightened almost out of my senses by the abrupt entrance of my father. Foaming with rage, and uttering fierce curses, he upbraided me for my conduct in clandestinely leaving his paternal roof; and then, having exhausted all his powers of abuse, he imperiously commanded me to make immediate preparations for my return with him to Washington; adding, that as a punishment for my undutiful and scandalous conduct, I should be compelled to marry the Hon. Mr. --before the expiration of another week. Not daring to make any reply, I bowed my head as if in token of obedience; and then, ascending to my chamber, I hastily threw on my bonnet and shawl and secretly left the house, not knowing nor caring where I should go, so long as I was beyond the reach of my tyrant father. The rain drenched me to the skin, as I wandered through the streets, a poor and friendless outcast. It was my misfortune to encounter a band of lawless and riotous men, who treated me rudely and doubtless would have subjected me to the grossest outrage, had not a merciful Providence directed my flying footsteps up the passage-way which leads to your garden. Fortunately, I was enabled to pass through the gate and to secure it, thus effectually baffling my pursuers, whose noise attracted ed your notice, my dear madam; and coming to ascertain the cause of the disturbance, you beheld me-a poor and friendless intruder upon your premises. You did not spurn me, as many would have done, who, judging from circumstances and appearances, might not unnaturally suppose me to be a wanton. No; you received the poor stranger with a smile of welcome and with the warmest hospitality, for which may Heaven forever bless you."' 
             
             
               CHAPTER XII. 
               JACK AND THE WIDOW. 
               Warm and tender was the embrace bestowed by the lady upon the "interesting stranger," at the conclusion of this very affecting narrative; and Jack's close proximity to that fine woman, combined with her unconsciously exciting caresses, began to create within him feelings which might endanger the preservation of his secret. 
               Philosophers in affairs of love assert that there is a nameless charm in the amorous relations which may exist between a youth in his teens, and a woman of mature age. Be that as it may, the handsome Mrs. Smith, with her winning softness of manner, beauty of countenance and voluptuousness of shape, inspired our hero with desires as ardent as had ever been excited even by the magnificent "Gallus Kate." 
               "Be comforted, my dear girl!" said Mrs. Smith-"you are here safe from the pursuit of your tyrannical father." 
               "Alas, madam!" cried the young impostor, who was struck with a sudden idea-"you know not my father's savage malignity and invincible perseverance. He will make the most strenuous efforts to discover the place of my retreat; and once again in his power, I am lost. Madam, I cannot remain in Philadelphia, for I dread being continually tormented by fears of re-capture. To-morrow I shall leave this city for New York, where I have friends who will afford me shelter and protection. Nay, do not oppose this resolution, I entreat you; it will be for my welfare to do as I have said." 
               "Well, my dear, you must act as you think best; and, although I should be happy to have you remain beneath my roof, as a companion and friend, still my wishes must not interfere with your interests. I trust that at some future time we may be enabled to enjoy the delights of social intercourse without any fear or restriction." 
               "Heaven grant it!" responded our hero, whose ideas of the "delights of social intercourse" with Mrs. Smith were of a nature which would perhaps have astonished that virtuous and pure minded lady, just at that particular time. 
               "I have a plan," continued Jack-"which I will submit to your consideration, and, if it meets with your approval, I will adopt it. My father will not hesitate to employ any means, no matter how harsh or unjust, which he may consider likely to place me again in his power. I fear that he may issue advertisements concerning me, describing my person, and offering a liberal reward to any one who shall furnish such information as may lead to the recovery of his "runaway daughter." Now, in order to enjoy additional security, in my journey from this city to New York, I have thought that it would be an excellent plan for me to disguise myself in male attire." 
               Mrs. Smith reflected for a few moments, and then said- 
               "I approve of this plan, my dear; for, although it may shock your delicacy to assume the garments of a man, still it is best to do so in order to provide against the possibility of your being restored to your cruel father." 
               "I am glad that you approve of it," exclaimed our hero with unfeigned joy; for he had anticipated some opposition to his plan from the fastidious lady, who had never "worn the breeches," even during the life-time of her worthy husband. 
               "But how, dear madam, shall I procure the necessary clothing?" inquired the artful impostor, with some appearance of anxiety. 
               "How very fortunate!" cried Mrs. Smith, as a smile of satisfaction illumined her charming countenance-"it is the very thing! Give yourself no uneasiness, my dear, on the score of your disguise; we shall not have to go far in order to fit you out in the most complete and admirable manner." 
               "What mean you, dear madam?" 
               "Listen. I have a nephew, about eighteen years of age, who is being educated at an academy in Germantown. He usually spends his vacations with me, for he has no parents; and as I shall probably never marry again," (here the lovely widow blushed and sighed,) "he will inherit what little property I possess. Well-this nephew is now at his academy, but a considerable portion of his clothing is here, and as I have the keys of his trunks, I shall have no difficulty in selecting from his really extensive and fashionable wardrobe, every article which may be required to convert you, my dear, into a young gentleman of the most unexceptionable exterior. When he pays his next visit, and hears what I have done, he will feel honored and highly pleased, at the idea of his having, although involuntarily, obliged so beautiful and fascinating a young lady as yourself." 
               "This kindness, dear madam, merits and shall receive my eternal gratitude," said Jack, who was overjoyed at this prospect of speedily resuming the garments appropriate to his sex. 
               "Say no more, my dear," rejoined Mrs. Smith-"in this affair I am merely acting as the agent of my nephew Augustus. It is perhaps fortunate that he is not here in person, for the sight of so charming a creature might play sad havoc with his susceptible heart." 
               "Ah, madam! you flatter me," said our hero, who really began to feel somewhat embarrassed by the lady's compliments and delicate attentions. The part which he was playing was an extremely difficult one, but he had all along sustained it with a skill and address that would have reflected credit upon the most accomplished actor. The unsuspecting nature of Mrs. Smith, and her easy credulity, had also materially assisted him in carrying out the imposture with success; although a far more penetrating observer than the good lady, might have been deceived as she was. 
               Although conscious of the excellence of his performance, Jack grew weary of his part, and longed to terminate the farce. This impatience might have originated in his ardent desire to be embraced in his own true character, by that singularly attractive and fascinating woman. 
                      
                        "Oh! how impatience gains upon the soul, 
                        When the long promis'd hour of joy draws near!" 
                     
                  
                
               "I do not flatter you," said Mrs. Smith, in answer to our hero's last words-"but enough of that. Since we have both determined that you shall become a gallant cavalier, suppose that we repair to the chamber occupied by my nephew when he is here, and there make a selection of suitable garments, and see if you can secure a tolerable fit. However, if you are too much fatigued, we can postpone the examination until to-morrow." 
               "Oh, let us go now, by all means!' exclaimed the young impostor, eagerly; for the lady's proposition was in exact accordance with his most earnest wishes. 
               Mrs. Smith smiled her assent, arose gracefully from her seat, took a light, and requested the supposed young lady to follow her. Jack obeyed, with a wildly palpitating heart. 
                
               The lady led the way into a large and handsomely furnished bed-chamber. The peculiar tastes of Master Augustus, its occasional occupant, were very strikingly manifested by various articles which lay scattered around. Here was a pair of boxing gloves; there, a watchman's rattle, and the brass knocker of a street door-the former wrested from some vanquished Charley, and the latter unlawfully wrenched from the habitation of some peaceable member of the Society of Friends. In one corner lay a pair of theatrical buskins, a sword, a plumed hat, and a spangled mantle; for, in addition to his many other accomplishments, Master Augustus was afflicted with Shakspeare, and belonged to an amateur theatrical club. The young gentleman was evidently also a connoisseur in female beauty, for the walls, besides being adorned with a picture of a prize fight between "Buffer Donnelly" and another pugnacious gentleman with an unpronouncable name, were ornamented with several rather loose paintings of ladies possessing great beauty and but slight costume. 
               Perceiving that her companion regarded these different objects with some curiosity, Mrs. Smith said, with some confusion of manner- 
               "Such articles, my dear, are certainly inappropriate things to be found in the house of a respectable widow lady; but allowance must be made for the tastes of a wild youth, whose exhuberance of spirits will sometimes lead him into folly, although he hasby no means a bad heart. He was never properly reared by his parents, and I have neither the strength nor the courage to attempt his reform, which is perhaps impossible. However, I have strong hopes that when he has "sown his wild oats," as the saying is, he will become a sober and respectable member of the community. His kind and affectionate treatment of me, always effectually disarms me when I begin to reprove him for some act of folly which never degenerates into positive wickedness. As he seems to take pleasure in these silly things which you see here, I have not the heart to disturb them, and accordingly suffer them to remain, although those pictures, I must say, are decidedly objectionable. Don't you think so?" 
               "Yes, madam," modestly replied Jack, who had been contemplating with a flushed countenance a superb painting representing a group of naked wood nymphs, engaged in amorous sport. 
               The lady, meanwhile, had been stealthily regarding a picture of the Apollo Belvidere, whose glorious proportions had ofton excited her admiration, and caused her widowed bosom to swell with feelings which she found it difficult to resist. For this pure and excellent woman had inherited a liberal share of those passions which are inseparable from humanity. 
               "Come, my dear; let us examine my nephew's wardrobe," said she. 
               Producing a bunch of keys, she proceeded to unlock various bureaus and trunks, from which she took a great quantity of garments, all of the finest material and most fashionable make; for Master Augustus was an exquisite of the first water, and prided himself upon the elegance of his attire, although he was indebted to his generous aunt for the means of procuring it. 
               Jack saw at a glance that the clothing would fit him to a nicety; and warmly did he congratulate himself upon this issue to his singular adventure-for not only had he secured a splendid suit of clothes, but he also cherished strong hopes-presumptuous dog that he was!-of being made the happy recipient of Mrs. Smith's kindness; for she had inspired him with the most ardent passion. 
               Jack's knowledge of human nature enabled him to perceive that this lady was a woman of strong passions, which is often the case with females of a calm and placid exterior. The surface of the ocean is sometimes smooth as glass, out who shall say what is hidden in its unexplored depths? "Still water runs deep," saith a venerable proverb, in which there is a great deal more truth than poetry. 
               Our hero saw in Mrs. Smith a woman eminently beautiful, and susceptible of emotions the most tender and voluptuous. Possessed of wealth, moderate indeed, but amply sufficient for all her wants, she lived in unpretending but elegant solitude, and enjoyed an unbroken leisure and a luxurious repose which gave her imagination free scope to wander, even against her own will, amid those flowery paths of pleasure from whose actual delights she was, from the nature of her position, excluded. She was a widow, too, and familiar with the blisses of love; how natural that she should recall to mind the joys of her past experience, and contrast them with the peculiar discomforts of her present solitary and widowed state! 
               To such a woman, how dangerous is temptation! Though she be "chaste as snow," ere its white and unpolluted surface is kissed by the wanton sun, let her not too highly estimate the power of her virtue; for, like the snow, that virtue, in an unguarded moment, may melt beneath the burning rays of a lover's ardent eyes. 
               Our hero saw the kind of material he had to work upon, and doubted not of his eventual success. One circumstance strongly confirmed his hopes: he saw the looks of intense admiration with which the lady regarded the Apolly Belvidere, and from that moment he had whispered to himself-"She is mine." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIII. 
               "VIRGIN MODESTY." 
               Having selected the most magnificent suit which the wardrobe of Master Augustus afforded, the young impostor expressed his wish to "try on" the garments immediately, in order to assure himself of their perfect fit. 
               Here ensued a very delicate scene and, in order to sustain his part properly, Jack was obliged to bring into requisition all the tact, skill and address which he possessed. 
               Mrs. Smith-who, of course, had not the slightest suspicion of the deception which was being practiced upon her-offered her services to assist the pretended young lady in the performance of the duties of the toilet. 
               The tone and manner in which the good lady made this offer, indicated that she considered its acceptance as a matter of course-its refusal, as entirely out of the question. For what could be more natural than for one lady to assist another, under such circumstances? Her fair young friend (she thought) was, from motives of policy, about to go through the unusual operation of putting on male clothing; and therefore her help was indispeasable. 
               Jack had his own reasons for wishing to perform his toilet alone. He did not wish that the lady should be astonished and shocked by any abrupt discovery. He desired that the truth should gradually dawn upon her mind, so gently, that when she perfectly comprehended the real facts of the case, she would be prepared to receive the declaration of his passion, without experiencing any sudden or violent emotion to destroy her natural ardent susceptibility. 
               Imagine the profound surprise of Mrs. Smith, when the supposed young lady respectfully but firmly declined receiving any assistance whatever! 
               "Nonsense, my dear child," said the nandsome widow, in a tone of gentle remonstrance-"how can you, without my aid, put on these awkward male garments, to which you are of course entirely unaccustomed? Come, take off your gown, and let me unlace your stays." 
               "Excuse me, madam. I cannot suffer you to wait upon me like a servant. Be assured, I can get along very well without your assistance; for, since my childhood, I have been used to dress and undress myself." 
               "That may be, my dear, but you have never yet dressed yourself in male clothing, about which there are many peculiarities unknown in the costume of our sex. Nay, I insist upon rendering my services, and shall be offended if you refuse them." 
               "But, my dear madam--' 
               "But me no buts, for I will not listen," playfuly interrupted Mrs. Smith-"you decline my aid because you wish to avoid giving me trouble; you will find, however, that I am a very obstinate creature, when I am determined to have my own way." 
               So saying, Mrs. Smith advanced and began to busy herself in removing the elegant dress worn by the young impostor. 
               Jack, finding himself driven, as it were, into a corner, resolved to make a bold push in order to rid himself of the lady's attentions, while changing his clothes. Casting his eyes modestly upon the floor, he summoned up a blush, and said, with much timidity and embarrassment of manner- 
               "You will think me very silly, I am sure; yet I trust, madam, that your refined delicacy of heart will enable you to appreciate my feelings. I may be prudish and ridiculously sensitive; I may carry to an absurd extreme that modesty and reserve which should characterize our sex. Forgive me, if I err; but it is better to err on the right side-is it not, dear madam?" 
               "I do not understand you," said the lady, astonished. 
               "Well, madam, I will endeavor to explain my meaning. I know, then, that from my earliest childhood I have ever felt an invincible repugnance to the most trifling exposure of my person, even to one of our own sex. I never could endure to dress or undress even in the presence of my mother, who observed this strange peculiarity of mine, and kindly humored it. This feeling has grown with my years, and at the present time I would suffer the greatest inconvenience rather than appear before a second person en dishabille. That, madam, is the true reason of my declining your kindly meant offers. Pardon me, but I could not endure the thought of your beholding me in a condition--you understand me, and I need not speak further. Oh, madam, would that I had never entered this house, for you will both hate and despise me for this worse than childish weakness!" 
               Mrs. Smith felt seriously offended. Her refined and womanly feelings enabled her to comprehend that excessive delicacy, or rather, bashfulness, which might render a young lady averse to being seen en dishabille, even by one of her own sex. Yes, she could even share in such a feeling. But surely her newly-found friend might have made an exception with reference to her, considering that the affair in question involved the mysteries and unaccustomed difficulties of making a male toilet, which rendered assistance almost absolutely indispensable. Under ordinary circumstances, the extreme modesty displayed by the interesting young stranger would have been excusable-perhaps commendable; "but under these peculiar circumstances," (thought Mrs. Smith,) "her rejection of my aid is carrying her ideas of propriety to a ridiculous length." 
               Here was another cause of Mrs. Smith's chagrin: it seemed to her that she had been surpassed in her notions of strict modesty by her young friend. She felt humiliated and experienced that vague sensation of uneasiness and self reproach which people often feel, when they imagine that they have done something wrong, and yet cannot distinctly recall to mind what that something is. 
               Therefore was Mrs. Smith offended. 
               Jack instantly perceived that he had lost ground in the lady's favor, but he contented himself with the reflection that he was in a fair way (as he hoped) to gain even more than he had lost. 
               "I have displeased you, madam," said he, with an air of contrition. 
               Mrs. Smith was too truthful a woman to deny the fact implied by the words of the young impostor. She merely replied by a faint smile; and remarked, as she turned to leave the chamber- 
               "When you have completed your toilet, you can, if you please, join me in the sitting room." 
               She closed the door after her, and Jack was left alone. 
               "I have hurt her feelings," thought he, as he began rapidly to throw off his female garb-"and I am sorry for it, but it could not be helped. When I return to her, I shall speedily restore her to the most excellent humor, and entertain her in a manner that she little anticipates. Ah! I am a fortunate fellow, to have managed my escape from prison, and gained a magnificent woman for my mistress, all during the same evening! However, she's not mine yet, and I may be 'reckoning without my host.' Now for the male toggery; I am delighted to cast aside these cursed female duds, and resume the proper habilaments of manhood. Ha! these broad-cloth pants fit me to perfection, and so, I am sure, will these elegant French boots. Faith, I am vastly obliged to Master Augustus for the use of his wardrobe; he is a fellow of taste, and I should like to make his acquaintance, but as that is not possible at present. I will express my gratitude for the loan of the clothes, through the medium of attentions to his handsome aunt." 
               In less than ten minutes after the conclusion of the foregoing soliloquy, Jack was completely dressed in a most costly and elegant suit of clothes, the cut and fashion of which would have immortalized a Parisian tailor. As he surveyed his really superb countenance and matchless form in the large oval mirror which surmounted the dressing-table, a smile of gratified vanity parted his finely chiselled lips, and he murmured- 
               "Ah! what woman could resist me now! Certainly not a buxom, voluptuous, and handsome widow, who has for some time been a stranger to the joys of love! By St Paul! the blood rushes like burning lava through my veins, as I think of that glorious woman! What eyes, beaming with a soft and heavenly light-what a mouth for kisses-what a shape, suggestive of substantial blisses-and then what a full, rich bust, as yet concealed from my enamoured gaze by that high-reaching dress, but these eager eyes shall ere long feast upon its beauties! Yes, these sacriligious hands shall invade that region of snow, and wanton amid its glowing treasures Never did Napoleon look forward to the achievement of a victory, with a mightier joy, than that with which I now anticipate the conquest of the lovely, chaste and languishing widow! Shine out fair sun of hope! But the devil take all soliloquizing; I go now into the presence of my divinity." 
                
               Jack entered the apartment in which the beautiful widow was awaiting his arrival. 
               His elegant appearance-the ease and grace of his manner-elicited from the lady a exclamation of surprise and admiration. 
               For the faintest shadow of suspicion that the young impostor was not a female, had never entered her mind, with such consummate skill and address had our hero played his part 
               She had expected, that when dressed in male attire, her young friend would present rather an awkward figure, and exhibit; the bashfulness and restraint of manner natural to a young girl who for the opposite sex. 
               But she found herself agreeably disappointed, and the pleasure which she experienced effectually dissipated her anger, and restored her to all her natural good humor. 
               She arose, and with a radiant smile held out her hand, which Jack pressed warmly to his lips. He then led her to the sofa, and placed himself at her side. 
               "What an astonishing change!" exclaimed the beautiful window, as she surveyed her companion with looks of undisguised admiration. "I can scarcely recognize you as the young lady form who, I parted a short time ago. Even your features look more masculine, your form more robust, and your appearance in every respect is that of a young gentleman." 
               "I trust dear madam, that the change which I have, thanks to your generosity, been enabled to you? If it is, I shall sincerely regret having abandoned the 'petticoat banner' for the honors of the breeches." 
               "Your alteration in costume, my dear produces no alteration in my regard or you. You are still a young lady whose misfortunes demand my sympathy. How mach you now resemble my nephew Augustus! The same graceful form and remarkably well-formed legs! This disguise admirably becomes you, and displays your symmetrical shape to the greatest advantage." 
               "Speaking of your nephew Augustus-ah! Dear madam, what a happy fellow he must be!" 
               "And why so, pray!" 
               "Because he is related to so beautiful a woman, and can pass a considerable portion of his time in her adorable society; because he can have the privilege of loving her, and enjoy the bliss of being beloved by her in return-and although that mutual affection is of the cold and chaste nature proper to the relations which exist between a nephew and his aunt, still it must be inexpressibly delightful when that aunt is so charming, dear madam, as your self." 
               "When did you learn such graceful flattery, my dear? It must have been poured into your ears by some eloquent lover. You could not speak with a greater degree of enthusiasm, if you were in reality a young gentleman." 
               "And if I were a young gentlemen, would you not hate and despise me?" 
               "I could neither hate nor despise you under any circumstances. But good heavens! When you spoke just now, your voice seemed to be as greatly altered as your garb. Its tones were almost masculine." 
               Jack threw his arm around the lovely widow's buxom waist, pressed her closely to him and said- 
               I could almost wish, dear madam, that my sex corresponded with my present garb, so that I might enjoy the luxury of loving you with that passion ate ardor which your beauty is so well calculated to excite in the male breast Then might I possibly inspire you with a reciprocal flame, and taste with you the ineffable blisses of love!" 
               The lady's superb bosom swelled with a deep and passionate sigh. Her downcast eyes and glowing cheeks proclaimed the effect produced by the exciting words of her companion. 
                
               "Oh!" cried the artful impostor, as he drew her still closer to his throbbing breast-"how happy will be the man who shall succeed in winning the priceless jewel of thy love-who shall claim the blessed privilege of holding thee ever in his arms, as I do now-who shall possess the right to kiss thy beauteous lips-thus-and whose nightly pillow shall be this peerless bosom, with all its glorious loveliness revealed to his enraptured gaze!" 
               During the utterance of this impassioned burst of amorous eloquence, Jack took good care to "suit the action to the word." The beautiful widow, bewildered, and excited by feelings which she could not exactly define, but which she acknowledged to herself were strangely delightful, abandoned herself without restraint, and with a wildly palpitating heart, to the kisses, caresses and audacious familiarities of her mysterious companion, who now commenced throwing off the false character which he had assumed. 
               A light began to dawn upon the lady's mind. Half frightened, half secretly pleased, and yet quite uncertain, she endeavored to extricate herself from Jack's embrace, saying, in agitated tones- 
               'Your words, your looks, your actions, alarm me! Who and what are you, thus to excite within me feelings which-nay, I cannot remain longer with you, for it seems as if-something tells me that you have been deceiving me. You are not what you pretend to be; you are--" 
               "I am your adorer!" cried Jack, now speaking in his natural tones; and throwing himself at her feet, he almost devoured her fair hands with ardent kisses. 
               "Ah, that voice! It is that of a man!" exclaimed the agitated widow-"good heavens! how indiscreet I have been, and how strangely blind, not to have detected this abominable imposture. Whoever you are, sir, I command you to quit this house in stantly. No gentleman would have taken this base advantage of a woman's unprotected situation. Go, sir!" 
               "Never, until those sweet lips have pronounced my pardon. Hear me, madam. I have long adored you in secret. Maddened by your beauty, I resorted to his stratagem in order to obtain admission to your presence. I am young, and will devote my future years to the promotion of your happiness. I am rich, and will throw my fortune at your feet. All that I ask in return is the blessed privilege of being permitted to consider myself your most devoted slave'" 
               "Who are you, then?" asked the widow, who was beginning to feel a strange interest in this eloquent and mysterious youth. 
               "I am, madam-ahem!-I am of noble birth. My father is Lord Ashbarrel, the British Minister, now at Washington! I will inherit the broad English acres and the ancient title of my distinguished and noble sire!" 
               "And your intentions-" 
               "Are honorable. Yes, charming madam, the sacred rites of the church shall sanctify our love. Thy peerless brow shall be decorated with the glittering insignia of nobility. In the halls of my ancestors, shall you, as the Lady Ashbarrel, receive the homage of a thousand vassals. It shall be so, upon the honor of a British peer!" 
               Never did a "walking gentleman" of light comedy recite a passage with more brilliant effect than that displayed by our hero, in the delivery of the foregoing extravagant speech, the audacity of which was fully in accordance with the vast amount of assurance possessed by him. Mrs. Smith was by no means a woman of penetration, and she saw nothing absurd in these lofty pretensions of the dashing and elegant youth, whose fine person and rare accomplishments she so much admired. She was as credulous and unsuspecting as she was beautiful and amiable; and her vanity was flattered by the idea of having a "peer of Great Britain" at her feet, an humble petitioner for her smiles and favors. 
               Ah, well! why need we dwell longer upon this scene? The reader has already anticipated Jack's complete triumph. The heart of the beautiful widow, already half rebellious against her better judgement, soon succumbed to the thrilling persuasions of excited passion. How could she resist the fervent pleadings of that eloquent and nigh-born youth, whose love for her was so romantic and sincere? Had she been an angel, she might have escaped from the tide of delicious emotions that overwhelmed her soul; but being merely a woman, two words will tell all the rest-she fell.
                
               And Jack Harold passed the night in delightful imprisonment within the arms of beauty. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XV. 
               CARROTTY TOM THE LOCKSMITH. 
               It was late when Jack arose upon the following morning; and if ever a fellow enjoyed a capital excuse for havinh neglected that maxim of health which enjoins the necessity of early rising, it is certain that he was that fellow, upon that occasion. 
               Having resumed the elegant garments of Master Augustus, he announced to the beautiful widow-who was now all smiles, and blushes, and amorous fondness-that certain business of importance, connected with his illustrious father's official position, demanded his immediate attention. 
               "I shall return this evening, queen of my soul,' said he, with the air of a theatrical lover-"to renew our transports, and to make arrangements relative to our union." 
               "Farewell, Frederick Adolphus," murmured the languishing fair one-for Jack had assumed that aristocratic title-"farewell. The hours will pass on leaden wings until your return. Ah! 'tis agony to part, but our reunion will be proportionably happy." 
               The lovers embraced, and separated. Jack issued forth into the street, and the enamoured widow, who had not arisen, threw herself back in her luxurious couch, and abandoned herself to the soft languor produced by the recollection of the joys of the preceding night, while she anticipated future pleasures. Having taken the first step in the path of frailty, this really well-meaning and once excellent woman found it both easy and delightful to continue in the flowery road of guilt, reckless of the horrible abyss of destruction in which that road is generally sure to terminate. 
               As we shall perhaps have no further occasion to allude to this lady, in the course of this narrative, we may as well here remark, in dismissing her from the stage, that shortly after her intrigue with our hero, she was so fortunate as to become the wife of a very worthy man, whose affection left her nothing to desire, Her unsatisfactory position as a widow had contributed to her fall from virtue; but, as her marriage with a man in the prime of life immediately placed her in a situation to her the most intensely gratifying, she had nothing to wish for, and was superior to temptation. Her subsequent excellent conduct as a wife and mother amply atoned for her fault. Eight months after her marriage, she presented her overjoyed husband with a son. The infant was of remarkable beauty, and the happy mother was struck with its extraordinary resemblance to a certain young British nobleman with whom she had formerly enjoyed a slight acquaintance. However, being a discreet woman, she said nothing. 
                
               We now return to our hero, whom we find again at liberty, and in the possession of a fashionable suit of clothes and a full purse. The garments were those of Master Augustus; the money was that which he had taken from the dead body of old Delaplaine. 
               So far from intending to repeat his visit to the beautiful widow, Jack determined to leave the city without any delay, for he well knew that every effort would be made to re-capture him. 
               It was not without many fears that he now passed along the streets, dreading every moment to encounter some police officer or individual who might recognize him and cause his arrest. 
               Not daring to approach a railroad or steamboat depot for the purpose of leaving the city, he resolved to get into the open country and trust to good fortune for the rest. 
               In pursuance of this design, he walked rapidly towards one of the great bridges which span the Schuylkill river, intending to cross and seek some safe means of conveyance to Pittsburg. 
               For he recollected that "Gallus Kate" and her paramour. Armitage, had fled to that city, and the deadly thirst for vengeance still retained possession of his soul. 
               He was hurrying forward, when he encountered a man whose appearance caused him to pause suddenly, while his face assumed the crimson hue of desperate rage. 
               The man was dressed as a mechanic, and was a hideously ugly fellow, with flaming red hair. On seeing Jack, he also paused, and turned pale as a corpse, while his knees smote together with fear. 
               This man was Carrotty Tom the locksmith, who had betrayed Jack and his partner in the affair of the bank robbery, in which the unfortunate Ribber was killed. 
               It will be remembered that this same fellow was the ringleader of the ruffians who, on the preceding night, had attacked our hero, supposing him to be a female, he being disguised in female attire. 
               Jack surveyed the trembling coward for a few moments without speaking, and then said to him, in tones of concentrated hatred, rage and scorn- 
               "So, scoundrel, we have met again!" 
               Carrotty Tom made no reply, but, turning on his heel, he would have fled, had not Jack caught hold of him with an iron grasp. 
               "Thou craven cur," cried our hero, as he shook the wretch until his teeth chattered in his head-"we part not thus easily. There is a heavy account to settle between us. 'Twas owing to your damned treachery that my friend met his death." 
               "Let me go, or I'll cry out for help!" faltered the affrightened locksmith, who, by the way, was a powerfully built man, and might easily have over come his youthful assailant, had it not been for his own despicable cowardice. 
               The street in which this scene took place being rather retired, there was no great probability of much attention being attracted by Carrotty Tom's cries for assistance. Jack perceived this, and determined to gratify his thirst for vengeance, at least in part, by inflicting upon the treacherous locksmith a most unmerciful thrashing. 
               Accordingly, he forthwith went to work upon the ugly profile of his victim with such industry and vigor, that a dozen or so of Carrotty Tom's teeth were extracted with a facility seldom achieved by a dentist; and, within the space of two minutes, the locksmith was as thoroughly whipped and terribly bruised as any gentleman that ever figured in the classical records of the fistic science. 
               "That's for your treachery!" cried Jack, as he planted a tremendous blow upon that useful organ wherein snuff-consumers usually deposit their titillating ting compounds of Scotch and Maccaboy. 
               "And that's for your attempted outrage, last night, upon an unprotected female," added Jack, with a laugh, as he made the unhappy locksmith see stars by a severe rap in the region of his optics. 
               This last blow was a "finisher" to Carrotty Tom, who lay "straightened out" upon the side-walk. The punishment which he had received was exceedingly severe, but he certainly deserved it, for he was a most unmitigated scoundrel. 
               Two or three persons had witnessed the foregoing scene, and were not a little surprised to see a great burly ruffian like Carrotty Tom so effectually beaten by a slender and handsome youth, dressed with all the elegance of a Parisian dandy. 
               Having completed this work of vengeance to his own entire satisfaction, Jack made a graceful bow to the spectators of the scene, as if to thank them for their non-interference, and then resumed his walk with as much unconcern as if nothing had happened. 
               The discomfitted locksmith picked himself up, as the saying is, and gazed at our hero's retreating form with looks of frantic rage, as he muttered a whole volley of fierce curses. It maddened him to think that he, a notorious bully and "blower"-a rowdy, and member of the desperate band of "Killers"-should be thus publicly beaten by a person so much his inferior in point of size and strength. 
               "Ah! Carrotty," cried out one of the spectators-"you had more than your match that time!" 
               "Yes," said another-"that young gentleman, notwithstanding his delicate and fashionable appearance, has spoiled your beauty for some time to some, old boy. Wonder who he is? He seems to be a perfect master of pugilistic science." 
               The words, "wonder who he is?" immediately suggested to the dull mind of the locksmith a plan of avenging his injuries; and he was astonished that he had not thought of this plan sooner. 
               "I'll tell you who he is," he cried, with sudden animation-"he is a robber-a burglar, and has broke out of prison. It is Jack Harold!" 
               "Nonsense!" exclaimed the others, incredulously-"the person of whom you speak is in jail, awaiting his trial for bank robbery and attempted murder." 
               "I tell you that it is Jack Harold! I blowed upon him in the bank robbery business, and that is why he pitched into me, just now. Follow and arrest him-quick, before he escapes-and you will get a reward. If he is not Jack, you may drown me in the Schuylkill!" 
               The locksmith spoke with an enregy that carried conviction with it; and the men started off in pursuit of the young Outlaw, who was by this time a considerable distance off. 
               A couple of police officers, who chanced to be in the neighborhood, on being briefly informed of the circumstances of the case, also joined in the chase. Carrotty Tom limpingly brought up the rear. 
               Jack, having walked very rapidly, had nearly crossed the bridge ere he became aware that he was pursued.-Then he bitterly cursed his own impetuosity and lack of caution, in suffering himself to become involved in a broil with the miserable locksmith, whom he should have avoided out of a regard for his own safety. It was now, however too late to remedy the evil. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVI. 
               THE LEAP FOR LIBERTY. 
               Jack's pursuers were close upon him. On either side of them were the railings of the bridge and beneath was the dark rolling river. Before him, beyond the bridge, extended a dusty turnpike road, bordered with numerous farm-houses. No place was visible likely to afford him concealment; not even a clump of trees or a cluster of bushes. 
               Should he dash forward and rush along the turnpike, trusting to his speed and agility as a runner, for his escape? No; for those in pursuit would fill the air with their shouts, and men would come forth from the farmhouses to stop him, and ferocious dogs would be set upon him. What, then, should he do? Tamely surrender himself into the hands of the Philistines? 
               "Never!" thought he-"I will stop and parley with these fellows, and try to bribe them If that fails, I have a plan; 'tis a dangerous and desperate one, but I'll try it!" 
               He paused, faced his pursuers, and awaited their approach. Thinking that the fugitive might possibly be armed and prepared to make a stout and bloody resistence, these gentlemen stopped at a safe distance, in order to deliberate. 
               "That's Jack Harold, I'll take my oath!" remarked one of the police officers. 
               "Ay," said the other-"so it is, but how shall we capture him? He is a desperate young chap, and is most likely well armed." 
               Our hero, guessing their fears, and wishing to have them approach him near enough to converse, now extended his open hands to show that he had no weapons, and endeavored by signs to assure them that he meditated no act of hostility. 
               Thus relieved of their fears, the pursuing party approached to within a few paces of the spot where Jack stood. Carroty Tom skulked behind the others, and, with his characteristic modesty, seemed to be desirous of keeping out of sight. 
               "Well, gentlemen," said our hero, courteously-"what is your business with me? Please to be as brief as possible, for I am anxious to be getting forward on my journey, having business of importance to transact." 
               "I am sorry, my dear sir, to disturb any of your arrangements," said the most gentlemanly of the police officers, with a smile-"but you must condescend to accompany us back into the city. Nay, so anxious are we for the pleasure of your company, that we will positively take do denial. our business is quite as important as yours." 
               "But suppose that I peremptorily decline conferring upon you the honor of my society?" 
               "I scarcely believe you to be capable of so ungentlemanly a refusal. To be obliged to resort to compulsory measures would cause us sincere regret." 
               "Come, sir, it is time to put an end to this masquerading," cried our hero, who was now beginning to grow impatient-"please to state, in as few words as possible, why you have followed me, and what you expect of me!" 
               "We have followed in order to arrest you, for you are one Jack Harold, an escaped prisoner, charged with heavy crimes. We expect you to return to jail with us peaceably, in order to avoid the necessity of our treating you with harshness, which, I repeat, would cause us regret, for there is something in your manners and appearance which interests us." 
               Jack thanked the gentlemanly officer for the compliment, and then, spying out Carrotty Tom, he thus addressed that worthy individual:- 
               "Scoundrel, remember my words. I am again indebted to you for being placed in a situation of peril, and I now owe you one. Half an hour ago I settled up with you for past services. You have now incurred another obligation, and be assured that the debt shall be punctually paid. The punishment that I gave you to-day, is nothing to that which I shall inflict upon you, when we meet again. Gentlemen, since this sneaking wretch is in your company, I cannot so far forget my own dignity as to join you. You will therefore excuse me for wishing you, in this abrupt and unceremonious manner, a very good morning!" 
               The next moment, Jack had leaped over the railings of the bridge, and plunged into the deep and rapid current of the Schuylkill river. 
               Petrified with astonishment, the spectators of this scene could scarcely believe the evidence of their own senses. 
               Our hero was an excellent swimmer; but, encumbered with a full suit of tight-fitting clothes, he found himself greatly embarrassed. Yet, with a stout heart, he struck boldly out, hoping that the current would soon carry him beyond the reach of his pursuers. 
               Recovering from the amazement produced by this daring and desperate act, the officers and their allies looked hastily about them, in the hope of discovering some means of overtaking the fugitive. They soon espied, drawn up on the nearest shore, a small boat, containing a couple of oars. 
               "The very thing!" cried one of the officers; and, followed by his companions, he ran to the end of the bridge and descended to the beach. The united strength of the party soon placed the little vessel afloat. The two officers leaped in, and, seizing the oars, rowed away most vigorously, leaving the others to regret that the small size of the boat prevented them from sharing in the glory of the chase. They hastened to return to the city, in order to spread the particulars of this remarkable affair. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVII. 
               THE CONDEMNATION. 
               The current had carried our hero to a considerable distance, but the boat containing the two officers gained upon him rapidly. Finding himself thus unexpectedly pursued, he redoubled his efforts, but all in vain. The minions of the law were soon upon him; and then, completely exhausted and over-come with profound despair, he suffered himself to sink in the watery depths, preferring to drown than to be taken. 
               But he was not thus destined to terminate his career-for there is a proverb which saith-"He that is born to be hanged can never be drowned."-When, almost senseless, he arose to the surface, one of the officers seized him in his powerful grasp, and dragged him into the boat. Hand-cuffs were immediately placed upon his wrists as a measure of precaution, and then the party hastened to effect a landing, in order to convey the prisoner to safe quarters. 
               Poor Jack! when he recovered his perfect consciousness, he found himself again an inmate of the same dismal dungeon from which he had made his escape on the preceding evening. 
               Here he remained two days. In addition to the other horrors of his situation, he was obliged to endure the brutality and abuse of the malignant turnkey whom he had locked in the cell, and who was not slow to avail himself of this most excellent opportunity, of visiting upon the unfortunate and helpless prisoner the full measure of his wrath. 
               Jack endured this oppression with philosophical fortitude; his mind was too deeply engrossed with the awful peril of his position, to admit of his bestowing any attention upon the petty annoyances of the miserable jail flunkey-otherwise, the latter gentleman man might have received some token of the prisoner's regard, more striking than agreeable; for our hero was full of spirit and courage, and was besides no contemptible opponent in a physical encounter. 
               On the morning of the third day after his re-capture, Jack's cell-door was thrown open, and he was requested to come forth. He obeyed, and found himself in the presence of two officers attached to the criminal court which was then in session. These gentlemen, having briefly informed the prisoner that they had come to convey him to the Court House for trial, politely escorted him to the trial, politely escorted him to the door of the jail, where a carriage was in waiting. 
               Having entered this vehicle, the party were soon driven to the massive stone edifice in which the solemn tribunal was sitting. 
               The court room was crowded to excess, and many ladies were present, for Jack's reputation had spread far and wide, and his exploits in crime, and escapes from prison, had rendered him the hero of the day. 
               On being placed in the prisoner's dock, which was considerably elevated above the audience, Jack gazed about him with a bold and undaunted expression. 
               Suddenly he started, and betrayed symptoms of extreme surprise-for, seated among the elegantly dressed ladies, herself the most beautiful one among them, was Mrs. Smith, his voluptuous companion of the night on which he had escaped from jail. 
               In attendance upon this lady, was a handsome and fashionably dressed youth, whom Jack naturally supposed to be no less a personage than Master Augustus, her nephew. 
               As the dress of our hero had been greatly changed, since his re-capture, the beautiful widow did not recognize in the prisoner at the bar, the "young British nobleman" whose grace and comeliness had seduced her from the path of virtue; and, not being at all desirous of such a recognition, Jack kept his head averted in such a manner as to prevent the lady from viewing his countenance. 
               The Judge upon the bench was noted for his extraordinary severity, and the prisoner saw that he need hope for no mercy in that quarter. 
               The usual formalities having been gone through with, the trial of the prisoner for attempting to murder Capt. Douglass was commenced. 
               The affair of the bank robbery had been laid aside, conviction being certain on the other charge, the punishment of which, it was thought, would be adequate to cover both offences. 
               We do not intend to weary the reader by giving a detail of the trial, which was short and summary. Jack declined the proffered services of counsel, for he saw the perfect absurdity of protracting the affair, which he knew must inevitably result in his condemnation. The frowning, dark-browed Judge, the savage looking jury, and the particularly malignant looking prosecuting attorney, who was renowned for his legal acquirements and bitter eloquence-all these combined to assure the prisoner that there was no hope. 
               "GUILTY," said the jury. Jack listened to the verdict with perfect indifference, for he had expected it as a matter of course. 
               Then arose the black looking Judge, with terrible eye, stern lip, and contracted brow. He quoted largely from the Revised Statutes; he talked learnedly on matters pertaining to law; he expatiated upon the divine majesty of justice, and enlarged upon the necessity of protecting society by punishing every description of crime with the most unrelenting severity. As for mercy, he remarked, that ridiculous quality had no business in a court of justice. He concluded a very impressive speech by sentencing the culprit at the bar to imprisonment in the Eastern Penitentiary, during the term of his natural life.
                
               The court then adjourned; the audience dispersed, the jury repaired to a neighboring tavern to lunch, and the Judge went home to indulge in a comfortable nap until dinner time. All were satisfied-excepting our hero. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVIII. 
               MARY THE MAID OF THE INN. 
               The Eastern Penitentiary stands upon the outskirts of the city of Philadelphia, and is conducted on a plan peculiar to the state of Pennsylvania.-The system here is rigid, strict, and hopeless solitary confinement; and although its intentions may be kind, humane, and meant for reformation, there can be no question that its effects are cruel and wrong. 
               To this terrible institution was Jack Harold sentenced for life. 
               Immediately after his sentence, the unfortunate youth was hand-cuffed, and conducted to the carriage which was to convey him to the place destined for his hopeless imprisonment. He was to go in charge of the same two officers who had brought him from the jail. These men were both rough and hard-hearted fellows, who could contemplate any amount of human misery without feeling a single sentiment of pity. 
               The party having seated themselves in the carriage, were driven at a rapid rate towards the prison. 
               As if Nature had determined to mock the misery of the doomed for life, the day was one of uncommon loveliness. Brightly shone the glorious sun from the deep blue of a cloudless sky; and the shining river danced merrily beneath its golden beams. 
               As the carriage slowly ascended a hill of considerable steepness and length, a prospect of singular and luxurious beauty opened to poor Jack's view. In the distance lay the busy and populous city, that from the height seemed still and lifeless as a region of enchantment over which the mid-day sun hung like a guardian spirit. Beyond, in sweeping diversity, stretched wood and dale, and fields presenting a yellow surface to the eye, ever and anon relieved by some bright patch of green; while, here and there, spire and village studded the landscape, or some lowly cot lay, backed by the rising ground or the silent woods, white and solitary, and sending up its faint tribute of smoke in graceful wreaths to the altars of heaven. 
               The Schuylkill river was more pregnant of life than its banks; barge and boat were gliding gayly down the wave, and the glad oars of the frequent and slender vessels consecrated to pleasure were seen dimpling the water made by distance smoother than glass. 
               As Jack eagerly but sorrowfully gazed at these different objects from the carriage window-objects which were to him so painfully suggestive of happiness and liberty that he could not enjoy-one of the officers said to him, with a coarse laugh- 
               "That's right, young feller-take a good look at the world in gineral, for it will be a d-d long while afore you have another chance to see anything except the inside of the stone box in which you are to pass the remainder of your life-ha, ha, ha!" 
               This brutal laugh was echoed by his companion, who doubtless saw something very witty in the remark. As for Jack, his thoughts were too busy with the horrors of his position, to admit of his attending to the unfeeling mirth of the officers. 
               At a short distance from the prison was situated a small road-inn, whose swinging sign proclaimed "Good Entertainment for Man and Beast."- Here at the request of the officers, the driver stopped-for the worthy minions of the law were dry, and they knew by pleasant experience that the liquor of mine host was of excellent quality. 
               One of the officers leaped out of the carriage and entered the tavern, while his companion remained to guard the prisoner. 
               The landlord-a second Falstaff, with a nose like a beet-received the officer with all the cordiality due to a good customer. 
               "Glass of brandy for me," cried the officer-"and carry another to my comrade in the carriage. Be quick, for it is time that we were at the prison." 
               While the landlord was bustling about to comply with these orders, his daughter, a young and very pretty girl, entered the tap-room. 
               The officer emptied his tumbler, and the landlord went out, decanter in hand, to supply the wants of the gentleman who remained in the carriage. When he returned, his countenance wore an expression of curiosity, and he asked- 
               "Pray, sir, who is that good-looking young fellow whom you have in the carriage hand-cuffed? I suppose he's a convict for the prison?" 
               "You're about right there, my man," replied the officer, with a patronising air-"by the way, landlord, I'm a devilish good-natured chap as you know very well, so I'll make a great man of you to-day-for nothing makes a man so great as being let into a great secret. Did you ever hear tell of Jack Harold the great bank robber, who broke out of jail and nearly murdered Captain Douglass, the head keeper?" 
               "Certainly-who has not?" 
               "Did you ever see him?" 
               "No! I can't say I ever did." 
               "You lie, landlord-you saw him just now." 
               "What?" cried the landlord, in astonishment. 
               "Fact, 'pon honor. That's him in the carriage, hand-cuffed; we're carrying him to the prison, where he is sentenced for life." 
               The landlord's pretty daughter hurried out in order to obtain a view of the famous young criminal, whose wonderful exploits had already rendered him the hero of her untutored and romantic imagination. Her heart palpitated with mingled love and pity, when she saw Jack's youth and beauty, and noticed his extreme dejection. Seeing that he also looked pale and weakly, she ran back into the tavern, poured out a bumper of excellent port wine, and then returning to the carriage, raised the tumbler to the prisoner's parched and feverish lips. Jack murmured his thanks, and drank eagerly, while the officer looked on with a grim smile. Even he had not the heart to interfere and deprive the poor prisoner of the last refreshment of the kind which he should ever probably enjoy. 
               "I pity you very much," whispered the young girl, applying her rosy lips to the prisoner's ear. 
               "Ah! such sympathy is sweet," answered Jack, speaking in the same tone-"you make me feel almost happy, in spite of my awful situation." 
               "Have you no hope?" 
               "None; the Governor will never pardon me, and I fear that it will be impossible to escape." 
               "Do not despair; nothing is impossible to a person like you. Come closer to me, so that the officer may not overhear us-so; now listen to me. Make every effort to break out of the prison, and if you succeed-as I prophesy that you will-come to me, and I will assist you. That is my chamber, with the white curtains to the windows. There is a ladder behind the stable-you understand me? Always reckon upon Mary Wilson as your friend" 
               "Dear Mary-for your kindness emboldens me to call you so-how shall I thank you?" 
               "By taking good care of yourself, dear Jack, and never giving way to despair," replied the girl, as a deep blush mantled upon her pretty face.-The most passionate love for the handsome young convict had already sprung up in her heart. 
               "What the devil is all that whispering about?" now demanded the officer, who had not heard a single word of the foregoing conversation-"are you courting?" 
               "Suppose that we are," said the young girl, pertly-"what business is that of yours, Mr. Sauce-box?" 
               "Oh, none at all, my pretty dear; but you've found a precious lover at last. Why don't you kiss him? You won't have another chance for some time-ha, ha, ha!" 
               The girl, wishing to provoke the officer-who was, by the way, a rejected suitor of hers-and being also urged by an irresistible impulse, threw her arms around Jack's neck, and pressed her warm, moist lips to his.-A momentary sensation of delight thrilled through the frame of our hero, whose blood had been warmed by the generous wine; and the heightened color of the girl iudicated the pleasure which she derived from the affectionate salutation. 
               "Well done!" cried the officer, endeavoring to conceal his jealously and chagrin-"now, my dear, won't you also give me a kiss?" 
               "Kiss your ugly face-never! I hate the very sight of you," replied the mischievous Mary, who delighted to torment this man, whom she really detested. 
               Mr. Sneak-for the officer rejoiced in that melifluous cognomen-colored with rage. At that moment, the other officer, who had been indulging in repeated potations, issued from the tavern, and resumed his seat in the carriage. 
               Old Wilson, the landlord, made his appearance, and angrily demanded of his daughter what she was doing, idling there, when she should be busy with her household concerns? 
               "She has been making love to this young rascal here, and kissing him!" maliciously bawled Sneak from the carriage window. 
               "Has she, the wench! I'll learn her to kiss thieves!" exclaimed Wilson; and with these words, the old brute rushed upon his daughter, and struck her. 
               Jack's blood boiled, but, of course, he could do nothing. The two officers laughed, and one of them remarked that old Wilson knew how to keep his daughter in trim. 
               "He often beats her," said the other-"she's a pretty girl, but rather wild." 
               The carriage now started; and, as he was being whirled rapidly away Jack saw poor Mary standing at one of the windows of the inn. She fixed upon him a loving and sorrowful look, and 
                     "Adieu! she cried, and waved her lily hand."
                  
                
             
             
               CHAPTER XIX. 
               THE SOLITARY PRISON. 
               In less than ten minutes, the carriage drew up before the prison; and Jack shuddered as he gazed up at the dark and frowning walls, within whose awful precincts he was doomed to be immured, a hopeless captive. 
               "Here we are," said one of the officers, as he leaped from the carriage; his comrade followed, and assisted Jack to alight. Then the two men, taking the prisoner between them, approached the gloomy pile. 
               Between the body of the prison and the outer wall there was a spacious garden. Entering it by a wicket in the massive gate, the party pursued the path before them to its other termination, and walked into a large room occupied as an office. 
               Here they were received by the governor of the institution, and several of his deputies. The two officers, having formally delivered the prisoner, and various documents relating to him, took their departure, after removing the hand-cuffs from Jacks wrist's. 
               The governor now made a short address to the prisoner, explaining the rules of the institution, describing the punishments which would inevitably result from any violation of those rules, advising him to abandon every hope of pardon or release, and exhorting him to peruse his Bible diligently, to pray constantly, and to endeavour, by a sincere repentance, to atone for the many crimes of his past life. The governor, at the conclusion of a most "refreshing discourse"-he was an ex-clergyman, by the way-assured the prisoner that, if he behaved himself with perfect propriety, he should be treated with every indulgence consistent with his situation. 
               This being over, Jack was conducted, by one of the deputies, into a smaller apartment. Here he was requested to strip himself entirely naked. This order having been obeyed, the deputy noted down in a book a most exact description of the prisoner's person, not omitting the brand of crime which had been placed upon his breast, years before, when he became a member of the "Unholy Alliance." 
               Having bathed, and had his hair cut snort off, Jack was furnished with a suit of coarse grey cloth, the convict uniform of the institution. 
               When he had duly arrayed himself in this "fancy costume," he followed the deputy back into the office, and there underwent a ceremony which now for the first time elicited from him a groan of anguish 
               This ceremony, simple in itself, but very significant in its import, consisted of the drawing of a black hood over his head and face. 
               In this dark shroud, an emblem of the curtain which was dropped between him and the living world, he was led to the cell which he was sentenced to occupy during the remainder of his life. 
                
               A description of this celebrated prison may prove interesting to the reader. 
               There is a large chamber, from which seven long passages radiate.-On either side of each of these passages is a long row of low cell-doors, with a certain number over every one. Above, is a gallery of cells like those below, except that they have no narrow yard attached, (as those on the ground tier have,) and are somewhat smaller. The possession of two of these is supposed to compensate for the absence of so much air and exercise as can be had in the dull strip attached to each of the others in an hour's time every day; and therefore every prisoner in this upper story has two cells adjoining and communicating with each other. 
               Standing at the central point, and looking down these dreary passages, the dull repose and quiet that prevail, are awful. Occasionally, there is a drowsy sound from some lone weaver's shuttle, or shoemaker's last, but it is stifled by the thick walls and heavy dungeon door, which only serve to make the general stillness more profound. 
               A man who becomes an inmate of one of these cells, or sepulchres, never hears of wife or children, home or friends; the life or death of any single creature. He sees the prisons officers, but with that exception he never looks upon a human countenance, or hears a human voice. He is a man buried alive, to be dug out in the slow round of years; and in the meantime he is dead to everything but torturing anxieties and horrible despair. 
                
               His name, and crime, and term of suffering are unknown, even to the officer who delivers him his daily food. There is a number over his cell door, and in a book of which the governor of the prison has one copy, and the moral instructor another: this is the index to his history. Beyond these pages the prison has no record of his existence; and though he live to be in the same cell ten weary years, he has no means of knowing, down to the very last hour, in what part of the building he is situated; what kind of men there are about him; whether in the long winter nights there are living people near, or he is in some lonely corner of the great jail, with walls, and passages, and iron doors between him and the nearest sharer in his solitary horrors. 
               Each cell has two doors, the outer one of stout oak, the other of grated iron, wherein there is a trap through which the prisoner's food is handed.-He has a Bible, and a slate, and pencil, and, under certain restrictions, has sometimes other books, provided for the purpose, and pen and ink and paper. His razor, plate, and can, and basin, hang upon the wall, or shine upon the little shelf. Fresh water is laid on in every cell, and he can draw it at his pleasure. During the day, his bed-stead turns up against the wall, and leaves more space for him to work in. His loom, or bench, or wheel is there, and there he labors, sleeps and wakes, and counts the seasons as they change, and grows old. 
               Imagine that ten years must pass over the head of the prisoner, in this awful place. Ten years! What a period of seemingly endless duration to him, immured within the gloomy walls of his narrow cell, daring not to breathe the pure atmosphere of heaven, or look upon the unclouded sky! His heart is never gladdened by the bright smiles of nature; he hears no sound but the whistling of the wind without, or the dull echoes of the busy loom reverberating along the vaulted passages of his prison-house, counting each day, as it wearies on, by the light which steals through the grating of his windows; at morn, praying for night, and with its approach, sighing for the return of day. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XX. 
               IMPRISONMENT. 
               If a sentence of ten years to this place be so terrible, imagine what must have been the feelings of Jack Harold, who, in the very flower of his youth, was condemned to imprisonment for life!
                
               On being conducted to his cell-one of the upper ones, to which there was no garden attached-Jack's black hood was taken off, and the scene of his captivity was disclosed to him in all its dismal monotony. 
               The doors of his tomb were closed upon him and locked, and he was left alone in his misery. 
               At first, he was stunned. His confinement seemed to be a hideous vision and his old life a reality. He threw himself upon his bed, and lay there abandoned to despair. By degrees, the insupportable solitude and barrenness of the place aroused him from this stupor, and when the trap in his grated door was opened, he humbly begged and prayed for work, saying-"Give me some work to do, or I shall go raving mad!" 
               Work was furnished him, and by fits and starts he applied himself to labor; but every now and then there came upon him a burning sense of the years that must be wasted in that stone coffin, and an agony so piercing in the recollection of those who were hidden from his view and knowledge, that he started from his seat, and striding up and down the narrow room with both hands clasped upon his uplifted head, he fancied that he heard spirits tempting him to beat his brains out against the wall. 
               Again he fell upon his bed, and lay there, moaning. Suddenly he started up, wondering whether any other unfortunate was near him-whether there was another cell like that on either side of him-and he listened keenly. 
               There was no sound, but he knew that other prisoners might be near him, for all that. He remembered to have heard once, when he little thought of being confined there himself, that the cells were so constructed that the prisoners could not hear each other, though the officers could hear them. Where was the nearest man-upon the right or on the left? Or was there one in both directions? Where was he sitting then-with his face to the light? or was he walking to and fro? How was he dressed? Had he been there long? Was he much worn away?-Was he very white and spectre-like? Did he think of his neighbour, too?-And, above all, how long was he sentenced to remain an inmate of his tomb-for life?
                
               Scarcely venturing to breathe, and listening while he thought, Jack conjured up a figure with its back towards him, and imagined it moving about in the next cell. He had no idea of the face, but he was certain of the dark form of a stooping man. In the cell upon the other side he put another figure, whose face was hidden from him also. Day after day, and often when he awoke in the middle of the night, he thought of those two men until he was almost distracted. He never changed them. There they were always as he first imagined them-an old man on the right, a younger man upon the left-whose hidden features tortured him to death, and had a mystery that made him tremble. 
               The weary days passed on with solemn pace, like mourners at a funeral; and slowly did poor Jack begin to feel that the white walls of his cell had something dreadful in them-that their color was horrible-that their smooth surface chilled his blood-that there was one hateful corner which tormented him. Every morning when he awoke, he hid his head beneath the coverlet, and shuddered to see the ghastly ceiling looking down upon him. The blessed light of day itself peeped in, an ugly phantom face, through the unchangeable crevice which was his prison window. 
               By slow but sure degrees, the terrors of that hateful corner increased until they haunted him at all times-they invaded his rest, made his dreams hideous, and his nights dreadful. At first, he took a strange dislike to it, feeling as though it gave birth in his brain to something of corresponding shape, which ought not to be there, and racked his head with pains. Then he began to fear it, then to dream of it, and of men whispering its name and pointing to it. Then he could not bear to look at it, nor yet to turn his back upon it. It seemed to be every night the lurking-place of a ghost-a shadow-a silent something, horrible to see; but whether bird, or beast, or muffled human shape, he could not tell. 
               When night came on, there stood the phantom in the corner. If he had the courage to stand in its place, and drive it out-he had once, being desperate-it brooded upon his bed. In the twilight, and always at the same hour, a voice called to him by name. As the darkness thickened, the Phantom began to live; and there it stood, a hideous figure, watching him till daybreak. 
               Again, by slow degress, these horrible fancies departed from him one by one; returning sometimes unexpectedly, but at longer intervals, and in less alarming shapes. Occasionally, the 
                  old agony came back; a very little thing revived it-even a familiar sound, or the scent or flowers in the air; but it did not last long, for the world without had become as a vision, and his solitary life, the sad reality. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXI. 
               JACK AND THE GOVERNOR. 
               Summer faded into autumn; and when the winter had passed, and spring had returned with all its beauty, Jack Harold was still an inmate of that horrible cell. 
               One day, the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania, accompanied by several members of the Legislature and other officials, paid a visit to the prison, and passed from cell to cell, for the purpose of examining the condition of the institution and its numerous inmates. 
               "His Excellency,"-(what an abominable title to bestow upon a republican officer!)-was a tall and singularly ugly personage, of limited intellect but boundless conceit; he had been elevated to office by one of those accidents which so frequently convert political cyphers into figures of the first magnitude, while men of true worth and ability are neglected. 
               When the party of distinguished visiters came to Jack's cell, the doors were thrown open, and the gentlemen crowded around in order to obtain a view of the youthful prisoner. 
               Jack, who was thoughtfully pacing to and fro in his cell, paused in his walk, and surveyed the party with an air at once haughty and stern. He disliked to be made an object of curiosity, and he believed that these persons had come for no other purpose than to stare at him. 
               Although our hero had now been nearly a year in confinement, his health had not been materially affected. The excellence of his condition was the result of the abundant exerercise which he took daily, and the sufficiency of good and wholesome food which he received. He had also, in a great masure, recovered his ordinary cheerfulness of mind, and this, more than anything else, had doubtless contributed to the preservation of his health, despite the pernicious influences of a close and solitary imprisonment. 
               The visiters were suprised to see, in that tomb-like place, a youth of such rare personal beauty and dignified aspect; for the crushing discipline of the institution almost invariably, in a short time, converted the most robust men into puny and spiritless wretches-mere animated corpses. 
               Jack was, indeed, looking remarkably well. He had taken extreme care of his person, and preserved the most scrupulous neatness in everything about him. Cut off from every kind of dissipation and irregularity, his entire system was in admirable order, and he needed but the air of liberty to complete the perfection of his bodily condition. 
               When first incarcerated, he had given way to despair; but the natural buoyancy of youth had finally triumphed over his feelings of depression, and hope whispered to him, that, not-withstanding his sentence for life, he should again be free. The consequence of this change in his spirits soon became manifest, in the improvement and preservation of his health. 
               But we must not so far forget the respect due to an exalted functionary, as to keep the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania standing at the door of a prisoner's cell, waiting for our attentions. So we will return to "His Excellency," and his retinue. 
               The Governor, not liking the stern and haughty air with which the prisoner regarded him, turned to the prison on officer who was in attendance, and abruptly demanded- 
               "Who is this convict?" 
               "Please your Excellency," was the reply of the obsequious officer-"he is sentenced for life, for attempting to murder Captain Douglass, of the city jail." 
               "Oh-ah; I remember; a desperate young villain," muttered the Governor. 
               When Jack heard this gentleman addressed as His Excellency, he knew at once that his visiter was no less a personage than the Chief Magistrate of the Commonwealth, who, in that State, alone possesses the pardoning power, independent of the necessity of seeking the concurrence of a Council, as in Massachusetts, where the Executive cannot act singly, in such cases. 
               Here, then, was an opportunity of very rare occurrence-a chance to apply for the clemency in person, and not through the indirect medium of a petition. 
               Jack instantly determined to avail himself of this opportunity. 
               "Who knows," thought he-"perhaps, if I ask him, in an humble and proper manner, the old fellow may take a notion to pardon me on the spot. Such things have happened; at all events, it is worth trying, and the effort cannot make my situation worse. So here goes." 
               Abandoning his air of pride, Jack assumed an attitude of entreaty, and, in a supplicating voice, he thus addressed the astonished Governor:- 
               "May it please your Excellency, you see before you an unfortunate and most wretched youth, the victim of cruel circumstances, which have combined to place me here, a prisoner for life, with all my hopes blasted and my feelings crushed. Driven by stern necessity into crime-my aged parents, and famishing brothers and sisters yelling for bread, and myself destitute of the means of procuring even a penny roll-in an evil hour the tempter thumphed, and I became involved in an act of dishonesty. Yes, your Majesty-I mean, your Excellency-my reputation, which until that fatal moment had been spotless and brilliant as the sword of a knight, became stained with guilt. Thrown into prison, I made my escape and on passing through the house of Captain Douglass the head jailor, that gentleman, from an exaggerated notion of duty, attempted to take my life. Self-preservation, nature's first law, prompted me to defend myself to the full extent of my ability. In the struggle, the Captain was unfortunately wounded, but is now well. For this offence, may it please your Royal Highness-I mean your Excellency-I have been sentenced for life. My punishment is too severe, your Honor-I mean your Excellency.-If I live to serve out my term of imprisonment, and stay here all my life, I shall be ruined-overwhelmed-crushed-in other words, completely floored. Therefore, great and illustrious man! whose fame is as enduring as the eternal hills, and lustrous as the stars-therefore, my good sir-I mean, your Excellency-damn my forgetfulness!-design to release me from these bonds, and I will at every convenient opportunity send up a prayer for your health, happiness, personal and political prosperity, and long continuance in the office which you now adorn. 'To err, is human-to forgive, divine.'" 
               The Governor, too obtuse to detect the irony contained in this singular appeal, and too egotistical not to notice and feel pleased at the gross flattery which pervaded it, gazed around upon the company with a bewildered air, and seemed to ask their opinion as to the propriety of pardoning the eccentric youth, whose mischief-loving propensities could not be restrained, even while supplicating the highest officer in the State for his release from perpetual imprisonment. 
                
               A half-suppressed titter, on the part of the company of visiters, who fully appreciated and enjoyed Jack's remarkable speech, delivered as it was with an effect half serious and half comic-led the Governor to suspect that the prisoner had been making game of him. Now this was intolerable to a man of his Excellency's irritability and importance; therefore, swelling with wrath, he said to our hero, harshly- 
               "What do you mean, sir-what do you mean? How dare you speak to me-to me? Do you know who I am-eh! Do you know that I have the power to let you go free, or hang you up, just as I see fit? (This was a stretch of imagination on the Governor's part; he was rather addicted to such little deviations from truth.) I won't pardon you, sir; I won't. You're not a fit subject for mercy. You must stay here all your life, according to your sentence. I shall leave orders with the warden to treat you with the utmost severity, for I believe you to be a desperate and hardened young reprobate!-Not a word more, sir, not a word; I won't listen to you. Officer, close the cell door!" 
               "Stay a moment," cried Jack, whose indignation was aroused by the harsh tone of the Governor, whom he longed to mortify and humiliate in the presence of the company-"before you go, gentlemen, suffer me to express my deep regret, at having so far lost sight of my own self-respect, as to condescend to ask a favor of His Excellency, who seems to be too much of a tyrant to comprehend, much less exercise the divine quality of mercy, and too much of a jackass to understand when he is made a butt for ridicule." 
               Then, addressing the astounded Governor, who stood pale and trembling with rage, Jack continued- 
               "I shall get out of this prison without your official aid, my high old rooster! Put that in your gubernatorial pipe and smoke it until your leather brains become singed! We shall meet again; and when we do meet I shall have just five words to say to you, and those words will be short ones. The interview will take place, not between a Governor and a convict, within the walls of a prison; but between man and man, beneath the blue vault of heaven, and upon the ground of equality. Gentlemen, pardon me for having detained you so long; but, really, I see visiters so very seldom, that when honored with a call, I am naturally disposed to make the most of it. I cannot at present return your civility, but may be enabled to do so at some future time, notwithstanding the objections of His Excellency. Good day, gentlemen." 
               Amid a general murmur of astonishment, produced by the audacity of his language and manners, Jack made a low bow, and turned away. The door was closed upon him, and the visiters departed, marvelling greatly that an inmate of that body-destroying and soul-crushing institution should, after a year's confinement, retain a sufficient amount of spirit to openly ridicule and threaten the highest dignitary in the State. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXII. 
               THE HIDDEN TREASURE. 
               Having lost all hope of being released from prison by Executive pardon, our hero now set himself seriously to work to devise some plan for effecting his escape. He well knew that this task would be attended with the utmost difficulty. Indeed, it was considered absolutely impossible for a prisoner to escape from that institution. Yet Jack determined to make the attempt, and either recover his liberty or perish. 
               In consequence of the Governor's recommendation, our hero was now treated with great severity by the officers of the prison. His food was of inferior quality, and he was required to perform a daily amount of labor almost double that demanded of him previous to the unfortunate visit of His Excellency. But this harshness only served to strengthen his determination to escape from that abode of solitude and hopeless misery. 
               His superior jugenuity was not long in suggesting what seemed to be a capital plan; and he proceeded to put it into immediate operation. 
               A young clergyman-the Rev. Mr. Spoons-officiated as chaplain of the prison. He was a young man of fine personal appearance, and graceful manners. Although a great dandy and a most unmitigated hypocrite, he made the most extravagant professions of piety, and was generally regarded as an earthly saint. These pretensions to holiness he managed to sustain by an externally correct deportment, and a constant solemnity of speech and manner. Few per ons suspected that, beneath that grave and pious exterior, there lurked almost every bad passion that can disgrace humanity, or degrade the sacred office of a minister of the gospel. 
               Jack, with his natural penetration, soon perceived the true character of this man, whom he now resolved to make an involuntary instrument of his escape from imprisonment, 
               As the convicts never issued from their cells, for any purpose whatever-not even to attend divine service-the reverend gentleman, in order to administer spiritual consolation to these poor, benighted souls, every Sabbath day went from cell to cell, passing a short time with each of the inmates, and exhorting them to turn from the paths of sin, and embrace the ways of righteousness and peace. 
               Thus far, the weekly visits of the young clergyman to the cell of our hero had not produced any very satisfactory results; for Jack detested hypocrisy is any shape, and he did not hesitate to express, his doubts of his religious friend's sincerity, particularly as the latter gentleman had upon one occasion manifested some slight symptoms of inebriation, and had also accidentally dropped from his pocket a card, upon which Jack found inscribed the address of the most notorious and fashionable brothel-keeper in the city of Philadelphia. 
               The Rev. Mr. Spoons afterwards accounted for his possession of the card by saying that he had been summoned to that "sink of iniquity" merely in order to pray with a dying fellow creature of the female gender; but Jack thrust his tongue into his cheek upon hearing this lame explanation, and pronounced the single word "gammon!" 
               Attracted, in spite of himself, by the intelligence, independence and boldness of our hero, the Rev. gentleman, under pretence of laboring for his soul's salvation, frequently visited him, and upon such occasions, he would remain locked up in the cell with the prisoner until he desired to be released, when, by knocking vigorously upon the door, he could easily summon the jailor who would let the holy man out. 
               The conversations which took place between the prisoner and the parson, during these interviews, were by no means confined to religious subjects. On the contrary, they embraced almost every variety of topic, and were conducted with the utmost familiarity, and without the slightest regard to the relative situations of the parties. By this means, Jack was kept "posted up" in all the news of the day; and, under the circumstances, the society of the young clergyman was to him a source of the most agreeable entertainment. 
               This was the state of affairs when the prisoner formed his plan of escape, which plan will be thoroughly developed in due course. 
                
               Shortly after the Governor's visit to the prison, the Rev. Mr. Spoons noticed that Jack grew extremely melancholy. All his cheerfulness had left him, and he seemed to be laboring under some hidden and overwhelming sorrow. 
               Attributing this apparent grief to the refusal of the Governor to pardon him, the parson endeavored to console the prisoner by holding out hopes of pardon when some other person should be elected to the chair of State. 
               "You mistake the cause of my sorrow," said Jack, heaving a profound sigh-"I no longer desire the pardon of man, which cannot benefit my soul My many transgressions require a Heavenly forgiveness, and 'tis that which makes me wretched." 
               "Can it be possible, my friend, that your heart has experienced a change?" cried the astonished clergyman. 
               "Thanks to your pious discourse, I begin to see the error of my ways," replied Jack, solemnly. 
               The Rev. Mr. Spoons, on hearing these words, so flattering to his vanity as a man of most immaculate piety, assumed a more than usually sanctified look, and began to think that he must in reality be a perfect saint, since his discourse had been the means of converting a sinner. 
               It is no uncommon thing to see hypocrites deceiving themselves as well as other people, and placing implicit confidence in their own purity and excellence. Bulwer somewhere remarks, that 'the easiest person to deceive is one's own self.' 
               "The Lord be praised!" cried the parson-"that I have been made the humble and unworthy instrument of conducting a lost sheep to the good shepherd's fold!" 
               "Amen!" responded Jack, as he privately placed his thumb to his nose, and waved his extended fingers in the air-a piece of quiet pantomime that was unobserved by the parson. 
               At their next interview, our here thus addressed his reverend friend:- 
               "I will not deny that my unsuccessful application to the Governor has caused me much disappointment; for I had a far nobler and more important object in view than the mere recovery of my liberty. Yes, I designed to do an act of justice, which should in part atone for my past crimes. Had I been restored to liberty, such is the mighty change which religion has wrought in my soul, that I should instantly have made reparation to those whom I have robbed, by distributing among them the enormous wealth which I have accumulated during my career of crime. But, alas! that satisfaction is denied me; here I must remain, while that illgotten treasure lies mouldering and useless!" 
               The clergyman, a man of expensive habits and but limited income, pricked up his ears when he heard the prisoner thus allude to a concealed treasure, and said- 
               "So, then, you have accumulated riches?" 
               "Unfortunately, yes. My many successful bank robberies have placed me in possession of an immense amount of money in gold, to say nothing of a large quantity of valuable jewelry, obtained by extensive burglaries in different cities of the Union." 
               "Where is this treasure deposited?" 
               "I am bound by a solemn oath never to reveal the spot where the property is buried. A partner in crime, with whom I took this oath, is now dead; but yet I regard the oath as sacred, and shall keep it I could only go in person, to recover the treasure." 
               "May I ask in what section of the country this treasure is buried?" 
               "I have no objection to answer that question. The gold and jewelry, contained in a large box shaped like a coffin, are deeply buried in the earth in a certain church-yard near Philadelphia, and not five miles from this prison. We selected a church-yard as our place of deposit on account of its security. No one would think of searching for gold amid the quiet inmates of the grave!" 
               "Very true," responded the parson, who seemed to be struck with a sudden idea. Now listen to me with attention. It is a great pity that you should be prevented from acting in accordance with the commendable dictates of your reformed heart. Could you be enabled to return that treasure to its lawful owners, what a burden of guilt would be removed from your conscience!" 
               "Yet, alas! it is impossible!" groaned jack. 
               "It is not impossible," said the parson, emphatically-"you may dig up the treasure, and through me, or some other trustworthy person, distribute it among those persons to whom it properly belongs. And when you have performed this act of justice, allow me to assure you that thousands of persons will sign a petition for your pardon, which the Governor will not then refuse to grant." 
               "But," said Jack-"how am I, a prisoner, to have an opportunity of digging up the gold?" 
               "It is simple enough. I will this very day speak to Mr. Fox, the warden of the prison; and I have not the slightest doubt that he will consent to your being conveyed-under sufficient escort and properly secured, of course-to any place which you shall designate; any churchyard, for instance, wherein you may desire to dig, in order to find the bones of some relative or friend.-You understand-ha, ha, ha!" 
               "Yes, I understand perfectly; but that will be violating my oath." 
               "Such an oath, involving an unlawful secret, is not binding; besides, you do not reveal, in words, where the money is hidden, which, I presume, is the only prohibition involved in the oath." 
               Apparently convinced by these flimsy arguments, Jack said- 
               "Well, so great is my anxiety to rid my conscience of this weight of stolen treasure, that I will agree to the arrangement which you have proposed." 
               "That is well. Mr. Fox and my self will probably be a sufficient guard to accompany you. I will go instantly and consult the warden upon this subject." 
               With these words the clergyman gave the signal and was let out of the cell, saying to himself- 
               "It will be remarkably strange if I fail to enrich myself abundantly, in this affair!" 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIII. 
               THE WARDEN AND THE PARSON. 
               That same evening, Jack was honored with a visit from Mr. Fox the warden, who came to the cell accompanied by the reverend chaplain, Mr. Spoons. 
               Mr. Fox, without any circumlocution, proceeded at once to business.-He was a gentleman of very decided manners, and pompous speech. He wore a wig of modern cut, carefully curled and powdered, which gave somewhat of a modish, and therefore unseemly grace, to a solemn eye; a mouth drawn down at the corners; a nose that had something in it exceedly consequential; eyebrows, sage and shaggy; ears large and fiery; and a chin that would have done honor to a Mandarin. Nature had impressed upon his mind a prodigious love of the grandiloquent; he disdained the exact language of the vulgar, and built unto himself a lofty fabric of words, in which his sense managed very frequently to lose itself. 
               "Convict," said Mr. Fox, addressing Jack with appropriate dignity-"this worthy minister of the gospel has received ceived from you a verbal communication, in which you have declared your ability to proceed to, and distinctly designate, a spot, peculiarly located, in which are secreted certain unlawfully procured valuables, abstracted from various establishments, which-moreover-and whereas--" 
               "It is all understood," impatiently interrupted the chaplain-"you, prisoner, are to conduct us to the place where the gold is buried, this very evening, as, for obvious reasons, it would not be so well to attend to it in broad day-light. We shall go in a chaise, and carry with us all the necessary tools. We had better start at once." 
               "Certainly," said Mr. Fox, as he produced from his pockets a pair of hand-cuffs-" with a convict who is sentenced for life, we must employ every needful precaution, in order to prevent the remotest possibility of the escape of the aforesaid convict, and to the end that we may not be made the dupes of any artifice which the said convict may ingeniously concoct, or otherwise-that is to say-moreover--" 
               The chaplain here gave a growl of impatience, for his fingers were itching to clutch the golden treasures contained in Jack's imaginary "coffin-shaped box." 
               The handcuffs having been properly adjusted upon our hero's wrists, the party stepped out of the cell, traversed the gloomy corridor, passed through the office, crossed the garden, and, emerging from the great gate, entered a chaise which was in waiting, and which contained a pick-axe and a couple of spades. 
               The night was beautiful, and a brilliant moon rode majestically through the star-spangled sky. 
               The prisoner's emotions were deep and powerful, on finding himself once more beyond the limits of those accursed prison walls, and breathing the pure, free air of heaven. 
               "By heavens!" he mentally exclaimed-"sooner than return to captivity, with this brace of soft fools, whose avarice renders them blind, I will die a thousand deaths. Smile upon me, sweet Fortune! thou fickle goddess, who hast treated me so churlishly of late; and this very night shall I stand within the chamber of Mary Wilson, the inn-keeper's pretty daughter!" 
               "In what direction lays the churchyard to which we are going?" demanded the Rev. Mr. Spoors, as he took the reins. 
               "We follow the main road to the city for a considerable distance," replied Jack, without hesitation-"I will show you where to turn off." 
               The clergyman nodded assent; and then, starting the spirited horse into a rapid pace, the gloomy prison walls were soon lost to view. 
               When the party drew near to the road-side inn of old Wilson, the heart of our hero beat with many conflicting emotions of joy, and hope, and doubt and fear. Judge, then, of his feelings when Mr. Fox announced his intention of stopping at the inn for a few minutes, in order to obtain a draught of mine host's excellent home-brewed ale. 
               No proposition could have been more welcome to the Rev. Mr. Spoons, than this; and, on arriving at the inn, the pious gentleman leaped from the vehicle with an alacrity far surpassing that displayed by Mr. Fox, who was rather infirm in consequence of a severe attack of the rheumatism. 
               Jack observed the latter gentleman's extreme stiffness, and was greatly rejoiced thereat. Then, hearing Mr. Spoons call loudly for a bumper of brandy, our hero's hopes of success mounted almost to certainty. 
               "All goes well," thought he-"with one of my guards a cripple, and the other half drunk, what is to prevent my escape?" 
               Mr. Fox, not daring of course to leave the prisoner alone in the chaise commanded him in a tone of authority to alight. Jack obeyed, and was conducted into the tap-room and seated in one corner, which, being remote from either door or window, was deemed a safe place for him. 
               The warden sipped his ale while the parson drank freely of brandy and water, which he seemed to enjoy with the utmost relish. Old Wilson, the landlord, waited upon both gentlemen with all the respect due to their importance; for he knew them, and they were excellent customers of his-particularly the parson. 
               No one took any notice of Jack, who, seated in his corner, like the celebrated "Johnny Horner" of pleasant memory, seemed to be buried in profound thought. 
               His mind, however, was racked with anxiety to see the pretty Mary Wilson; he longed that she should become acquainted with the state of affairs, in order that she might be prepared to receive him in her chamber, and assist him in his flight, as had been agreed between them nearly a year before, when he was being conveyed to the prison. 
               To his great joy, the Rev. Mr. Spoons, warmed with the liquor he had drank, suddenly said to the obsequious landlord- 
               "Friend Wilson, where is your handsome daughter? Your house loses more than half its attractions, when she is absent." 
               The landlord chuckled, rubbed his hands with delight, and replied- 
               "Your notice of my daughter does me honor. In truth, the wench is passing comely, but very obstinate. If I could only persuade her to marry-but she has got some strange notions in her head, and won't listen to the idea of choosing a husband. She's in love with some worthless rascal, I'll be sworn. But you shall see her, gentlemen, immediately." 
               He left the room, but almost instantly returned, followed by his daughter. 
               The young girl, on seeing our hero, recognized him at once. Her surprise at this unexpected meeting was so great, that she with difficulty repressed a scream; but our hero made her a rapid but significant sign, and she remained silent. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIV. 
               THE CHURCH-YARD. 
               Mary's appearance was charming. Her plump cheeks glowed with the rich hue of perfect health, and her gloss hair, in most picturesque disorder, fell over her neck and shoulders of snow. Her rustic beauty, and the hope of tasting the sweetness of those balmy lips, in the thrilling privacy of her own chamber, increased our hero's determination to escape from his guards. 
               With impertinent familiarity, the now half-intoxicated clergyman chucked the young girl under the chin, and then suddenly bending forward, snatched a kiss from her lips. 
               Mary was about to resent this insult with a proper display of indignation, when a sudden thought seemed to strike her, and she merely blushed and smiled. 
               For she was anxious to keep on good terms with the clergyman, in order to learn from him the particular circumstances under which Jack had been taken from the prison. 
               She was not left long in the dark in this respect, for the potent liquor had loosened Mr. Spoons' tongue, and, not regarding the winks and nudges of Mr. Fox, he informed the landlord that the prisoner was going to point out the spot where a valuable treasure was buried. 
               Then, with the natural quickness of a woman's wit, Mary Wilson very nearly comprehended our hero's plan. Giving him a glance of intelligence and encouragement, she approached the clergyman with a coaxing air, and requested permission to give the poor prisoner a glass of wine. 
               "For you know dear Mr. Spoons," said she, as her soft hand coquettishly toyed with that of the amorous gentleman-"that this unfortunate prisoner will require some refreshment to enable him to go through the toil of digging up the treasure." 
               Who could have resisted this appeal, which was uttered in the most musical tones in the world? Mr. Spoons certainly could not; and he gave the desired permission. 
               Mary filled a tumbler half full of excellent brandy, and presented it to our hero, who quickly imbibed the exhilerating fluid, and then, as he returned the glass, stealthily pressed the fair hand which had given it to him. 
               The young girl responded to the pressure with a glance of love, and passion, and triumphant anticipation. 
               Mr. Fox now arose, and declared that it was time to be moving. 
               "I hope you may be successful," said Mary, glancing meaningly at the prisoner. 
               "There can be no doubt of it," replied Jack, with strong emphasis. 
               The limping warden and the staggering clergyman, each took an arm of our hero; and the three having placed themselves in the chaise, away sped the horse at his utmost speed. The roadside inn was soon left far behind. 
               The copious dose of brandy which Jack had taken warmed his blood and raised his spirits to the highest degree of buoyancy. His long abstience from both wine and woman," well qualified him to enjoy both, to their fullest extent. 
               The party had driven probably about three miles, when the prisoner espied a narrow cross-road which he knew led to a little village in which was a church-yard. 
               "We turn off here" said Jack-"and have but a short distance to go now." 
               Both the warden and the clergyman grunted in token of their satisfaction; and both in imagination, were already clutching the gold. 
               Having turned off into the crossroad, as directed, the party shortly arrived opposite the low stone wall which enclosed the village church-yard. 
               "This is the place," said Jack-"you had better fasten the horse in the deep shadow of these trees. We can easily climb over the wall." 
               The horse having been secured as suggested Messrs. Spoons and Fox took the tools from the chaise, placed them on the inside of the wall, and then, taking hold of Jack's arms, assisted him to climb over-a task which was attended with considerable difficulty, on account of the hand-cuffs which confined our hero's arms. 
               At length the whole party stood within the precincts of that hallowed spot, devoted to the quiet slumbers of the dead. 
               A solemn silence prevailed, save when the soft breeze rustled amid the foliage of the weeping willows, that bent over the graves like guardian spirits. Here and there a tomb-stone arose in the moon-beams like a ghost; and troops of gliding shadows seemed to gather in obscure corners, for the purpose of repelling the invaders of their mysterious abode. 
               The limping warden and the half-intoxicated clergyman could not forbear shuddering, as they looked around upon this solemn scene. They felt as if they were doing something unlawful and sacriligious, in thus accompanying a convict, at night, to a church-yard, for the purpose of searching among the graves for stolen treasures. In the same proportion as their fears gained the ascendency over them did the courage and confidence of our hero increase; and, had he not been hand-cuffed, he would without ceremony have leaped over the wall, and trusted to his own agility for his escape from two such inefficient guards. 
               "I like not this adventure; let us go back," said Mr. Fox, as he rubbed his rheumatic shin, which he had brought into violent contact with a tomb-stone. 
               "No, damn it!" cried the clergyman, forgetting, in his intoxication and excitement, his pretensions to holiness-"we have gone too far to retreat. Besides, I know a delicious little widow who can only be bought with gold and jewelry, and this treasure is the very thing. Ha, ha! we parsons are the fellows to gull the natives! But honor bright, you know-mum's the word. Prisoner, conduct us to the place of deposit." 
               "This way, gentlemen," said Jack; and, followed by Messrs Spoons and Fox, (who carried the tools,) he led the way to a corner of the church yard which was in deep shadow, and paused before a mound of earth having the ordinary appearance of a grave without a tomb-stone. 
               "Here," said the prisoner, with a sanctified air-"buried six feet below the surface of the ground, and contained in a coffin, are those immense treasures which I have accumulated during my career of crime, and which, my heart having become touched with repentance, I am most anxious to have restored to those persons from whom the said treasures were unjustly taken. Let this act of reparation atone for my past transgressions! Praised be the Lord! Dig away!" 
               Off came the parson's coat in a trice; and seizing a spade, he attacked the mound of earth with a vigor that soon made the perspiration pour from his face, unaccustomed as he was to employment so laborious. However, nerved by the near prospect of obtaining wealth, and stimulated by the hope of securing possession of the "delicious little widow" to whom he had alluded, the reverend gentlemen persevered manfully, and ere long he had dug to the depth of several feet. 
               When he had become thoroughly fatigued, he leaped from the hole, and Mr. Fox, with many a groan of anguish, scrambled in to take his place. 
               The soil had now got to be so very hard, that it was necessary to loosen it with the pick. Jack could hardly refrain from laughing, when he beheld the infirm Mr. Fox, engaged in the unusual gymnastic exercise of brandishing an enormous pick-axe, and pausing between each stroke to rub his afflicated shins and mutter deep curses. 
               Mr. Fox soon became exhausted, and was obliged to desist. With a sorrow ful sigh, Mr. Spoons was preparing to resume his place in the hole, when Jack remarked- 
               "It is a pity, gentlemen, that you should thus fatigue yourselves. Here am I, young and strong, and greatly in need of exercise. Let me take a turn at the spade, and I'll engage that it will not be long ere the golden treasure is revealed to your sight." 
               "But you are hand-cuffed, and cannot work," said Mr. Fox, who was panting for breath. 
               "Surely," rejoined Jack-"you are not afraid to set my arms free for a short time, in order that I may assist you in this laborious task. Are there not two of you, to prevent my escape, if I were inclined to make the attempt-which, heaven knows, I am not; for I repeat that I am anxious to make atonement to society for my crimes." 
               The warden hesitated, and said- 
               "The sentence against you is a very heavy one. I hardly know if it would be safe-" 
               "Oh, very well," interrupted Jack, with assumed indifference-"act your own pleasure, sir; it is nothing to me. I only wanted to assist you." 
               The parson, being rather averse to manual labor of any kind, was strongly disposed to favor the prisoner's proposition. He had, moreover the most implicit confidence in his own sagacity. Therefore he remarked to the more cautious warden- 
               "This work is very toilsome, and we really need help. There can be no danger in taking off the prisoner's irons for a short time. I myself will be responsible for his safety." 
               Mr. Fox hesitated no longer. Taking a key from his pocket, Jack was soon relieved from his hand-cuffs; and seizing a spade, he leaped into the hole, and began to throw out the dirt most manfully, while his two guards looked on with the highest degree of satisfaction. 
               Our hero worked away until the hole was very nearly six feet deep; and then, complaining of fatigue, he asked and obtained permission to come out. Accordingly, he scrambled up, though not without difficulty; and the parson prepared to take his place. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXV. 
               THE COFFIN AND ITS CONTENTS. 
               "A little more digging will bring you to the treasure," remarked our hero, as the clergyman carefully descended into the pit. 
               "I will put on your hand-cuffs," said the cautious warden, as he produced those ornaments of the wrists, and advanced to the prisoner. 
               Just at that moment-so critical to Jack-the parson, who had thrown out two or three spade's-full of earth, cried out, in a tone of triumph- 
               "Hurrah! I have come to the box of treasure!" 
               On hearing this gratifying intelligence, Mr. Fox, forgetful of his intention of ironing the prisoner, leaned over the deep and narrow cavity, in order to obtain a view of the casket of treasure. 
               Jack placed himself at the warden's side. 
               "The box is large, and shaped exactly like a coffin!" cried the elated parson-"there is even a silver plate upon it-placed there, no doubt, in order to avert suspicion, should the box be discovered. From appearances, no one would suspect that this was anything but an ordinary coffin, containing a corpse. There's something in it more valuable, however, as we shall soon see. It will be very difficult, I am afraid, to raise the box from this hole, for gold is very heavy." 
               "Can you not open it, and pass up the treasures in small quantities at a time? 'Twill be the easiest way," said the warden, who was trembling with eagerness to behold the glittering spoils. 
               The parson assented to this proposal. Having contrived to introduce the sharp point of the pick-axe between the coffin and the lid, he gave a vigorous wrench; a large portion of the lid flew off with a crashing noise. 
               Just then a dark cloud stole over the surface of the moon, and obscured her brightness. 
               Mentally cursing the sudden darkness which prevailed, the parson stooped down and thrust his hand into the crevice which he had made in the box, in order to clutch a portion of the treasure. 
               Scarce had he done so, when he uttered a loud cry of astonishment and terror. 
               For his hand, instead of grasping a quantity of golden coins or precious jewels, came in contact with the cold and clammy face of a corpse. 
               "Oh, God! assist me out of this dreadful place!" cried the affrightened parson, as he made ineffectual efforts to climb out of the grave. 
               He imagined that the disturbed corpse, arrayed in its frightful shroud, was arising from its coffin, in order to twine its dead arms around him. 
               The cloud passed from the surface of the moon, which now shone forth with all its former brilliancy. 
               Then, for the first time, the warden, as he gazed down into the grave with mingled curiosity and fear, beheld the dreadful spectacle. 
               The parson, having failed in his attempt to regain a position upon terra firma, was crouched down in one corner of the grave, shaking with horror. 
               And oh, fearful sight! painfully visible in the bright moon-beams, was the ghastly face of the corpse, upon which corruption had begun to set its disgusting seal. 
               The warden, with a sickening sensation, turned for a moment from the awful scene. Then, recovering his presence of mind, he regarded our hero with a furious look, and exclaimed- 
               "Scoundrel! you have deceived us! What is the meaning of all this?" 
               "Go down and see," replied Jack, as he gave the warden a sudden and violent push forward. 
               Taken completely by surprise, Mr. Fox plunged headlong into the grave, and falling heavily upon the parson, that gentleman was rendered for the time insensible, more through fear than in consequence of any actual injury received by him. 
               As for Mr. Fox, his lameness prevented the possibility of his getting out of the grave without assistance. However, he began to call loudly for help; and to stifle his cries, Jack seized the spade which had not been in use, and with it cast a quantity of earth upon the head of the unfortunate warden, who was soon too busily engaged in clearing the dirt from his eyes, mouth and nostrils, to admit of a continuation of his calls for help. 
               "My business is now completed in this place; I must be off," thought our hero; and running to the church-yard wall, he leaped over it, and repaired to the spot were the horse and chaise had been left. 
               Finding all in safety, he entered the vehicle, and drove off rapidly. He had proceeded but a short distance down the cross-road leading to the main turnpike, when he encountered several men belonging to the village, who were returning from Philadelphia. 
               An idea struck our hero. "Those poor devils," said he to himself-"may perish in that grave, unless they are taken out. I will inform these countrymen of their situation; but I must do it in such a manner that they will not suspect the true circumstances of the case." 
               Checking the horse, he addressed the countrymen, who had civilly withdrawn themselves to one side of the narrow road, in order to let him pass; for, from the style of the equipage, they imagined Jack to be some gentleman of consequence, an opinion that was confirmed by the lofty and patronising tone of superiority which he assumed. As for the prison garb which he still wore, there was nothing in the dark grey cloth of which it was made, sufficiently remarkable to excite suspicion, or even to attract attention, at night. 
               "My good fellows," said Jack-"I am a Philadelphia physician, and have been a few miles beyond your village to attend a sick patient. On my return, while passing the church-yard just above, I noticed two men within the enclosure, who appeared to be occupied in a suspicious manner. Knowing that there are wretches in the employ of unprincipled members of the medical faculty, who do not scruple to rob the grave of its inmate, I cautiously watched these men, and soon became convinced that they were what is called resurrectionists, or body-snatchers.-Though I myself am devoted science, I never have resorted to such a diabolical method of acquiring scientific knowledge. Therefore, fired with indignation, I sprang over the wall of the church-yard and rushed upon the villains. After a severe struggle, I succeeded in hurling them both into the grave which they had defiled; and I am now hastening to the city in order to summon a sufficient police force to take these wretches into custody, that they may receive the punishment due to their unnatural crime. Meanwhile, my honest fellows, you will confer a favor upon humanity and the cause of justice by going and securing the robbers of the dead; as otherwise they may possibly make their escape, before I can return with the officers." 
               "We'll take care of the scoundrels, your honor," replied one of the countrymen-"but will you be good enough to tell us in what part of the churchyard the grave be, what you throw'd them into?" 
               "The grave is situated in the extreme north-east corner," answered Jack. 
               "What! is it a grave without a tomb-stone, nearest the wall, with two willows growing not far from it?" 
               "The very same," replied our hero, much surprised. 
               The countryman gave utterance to a deep and terrible oath, and exclaimed- 
               "It is the grave of my wife, whom I buried a fortnight ago! Follow me, comrades, and we'll take the law into our own hands, and lynch the villains! death to the robbers of the dead!" 
               "Ay! death to the robbers of the dead!" cried the others; and the whole party of countrymen rushed off towards the churchyard, at headlong speed. 
               "I fear that it will go hard with the warden and the parson," thought Jack-"but they deserve some punishment for their avarice. Their motives in searching for the supposed treasure, were entirely selfish. The parson, in particular, merits chastisement, he is such a confounded hypocrite. I should like to stay and see the result of this strange affair; but I must not compromise my safety. Now for the road-side inn and the chamber of the pretty Mary Wilson! A year's abstinence from lovely woman's caresses, renders a fellow furious! Dash on, my gallant steed! Bright star of fortune, I thank thee!" 
               Highly elated with the complete success of his daring and ingenious plan, Jack drove at full speed towards the abode of the pretty Mary. 
               Let us, in the meantime, return to a couple of very respectable gentlemen, whom we left in what may be termed a "peculiarly perplexing predicament." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVI. 
               LYNCH LAW. 
               Although Mr. Fox, the dignified warden of the Eastern Penitentiary, seldom indulged in the luxury of swearing, he found it impossible to repress a few muttered curses, on finding himself at the bottom of a deep grave, in close companionship with a corpse, and nearly suffocated by the earth which had been so plentifully showered upon his head. He had also to endure the pangs of disappointment, in relation to the expected treasure; and the mortifying reflection that he had lost a prisoner solely on account of his own credulity and avarice, embittered his feelings still more. 
               As for the parson, he soon recovered his senses. Starting to his feet, he glanced at the pale face of the corpse with a shudder; and then, addressing his partner in misfortune, he said- 
               "We have both been regularly victimized, and the least said about this affair the better. Our first object is to get out of this horrible hole. Permit me to mount upon your shoulders that I may extricate myself, which being done, I will help you up." 
               The warden did not much like this arrangement; however, he submitted for he was as anxious to get out of the grave as his reverend friend. 
               Mr. Spoons having gained the surface of the "upper earth," took hold of the hands of Mr. Fox, and with much difficulty succeeded in placing that gentleman also upon terra firma.
                
               They had scarcely time to congratulate themselves on their liberation from so horrible a captivity, when they found themselves in the rough grasp of half a dozen men-the countrymen whom Jack had met upon the road. 
               These men began to beat and bruise the warden and the parson most sorely, at the same time loudly vociferating- 
               "Death to the robbers of the dead!" 
               "Death to the villains who have dishonored the grave of my wife, and would have stolen her corpse!" thundered one of the countrymen, who had been gazing down into the violated grave, with tearful eyes. 
               "Away with them-let us hang them upon the nearest tree!" cried the others. 
               A short time previous to these events, a grave in that same church-yard had actually been robbed of the body of a most respectable inhabitant of the village; and this circumstance will account for the fury displayed by the countrymen, on getting the supposed grave-robbers into their power. 
               "These must be the same rascals as robbed the grave of 'Squire Goodwin, three weeks ago!" exclaimed one of the men. 
               "Ay, ay-we've caught them, sure enough," said another-"let's hang them without judge or jury; this tree will serve for a gallows, and I've got a strong cord in my pocket!" 
               Up to this moment, Messrs. Fox and, Spoons had been too much frightened and bewildered to attempt any explanation of the situation in which they had been found. But the immediate prospect of being strung up by the neck, suddenly restored them to their senses, for the close contemplation of a halter, when it is apparently destined to encircle one's own neck, can scarcely fail to set a fellow into a "devil of a thinking." 
               Seeing the necessity of making the most powerful efforts, in order to avoid the unpleasant contraction of their wind-pipes, the warden and the parson now attempted to explain; but as, in their eagerness to be heard, they kept continually interrupting each other, they merely created confusion, instead of producing any impression in their favor. 
               "Gentlemen, you mistake; I am the warden-" 
               "You do me injustice, gentlemen; I am the chaplain-" 
               "I am a respectable man, and-" 
               "I am a Christian minister, and-" 
               "You take me for a grave-robber but-" 
               "You suppose me to be a villain but-" 
               "I came here, supposing that a treasure-" 
               "A damned rascal of a prisoner told me that a treasure-" 
               "For heaven's sake, listen-" 
               "My explanation, gentlemen, is-" 
               "Help, help!" 
               "Murder, murder, mur-d-e-r!" 
               Totally disregarding these protestations and cries, which in truth, they did not understand, the enraged countrymen dragged the two victims to a neighboring tree, and prepared to put in force that summary and diabolical system known throughout the South and West as lynch law.
                
               We called it a diabolical system, and it is so. It is truly horrible to see a crowd of men, crazy with excitement, and perhaps drunk with rum, usurping the sacred powers of regularly constituted law-in other words," taking the law into their own hands"-and drugging some poor devil to a sudden and violent death, upon the mere suspicion of crime, without allowing him the inalienable right of the greatest criminal upon the face of the earth-the right of enjoying an impartial trial, by a jury of his country. 
               It is also horrible to behold the indifference with which such outrages against law and justice, are regarded, particularly by the press, which often alludes to these flagrant acts as the "pardonable excesses of a justly-indignant populace!" 
               The general prevalence of "lynch law" would afford a splendid opportunity for any malignant or envious wretch to accomplish the destruction of an enemy or a rival. He would only be obliged to put in circulation some infamous falsehood concerning his destined victim, who, with the public indignation strongly excited against him, would be liable at any moment to be dragged forth by a ruthless mob, and hung up like a dog! 
               Every participant in such an outrage should receive the punishment due to a deliberate murderer. 
               The writer of these pages has seen a man, in a Southern state-the boasted abode of chivalry and honor-a man merely accused of an odious crime, bound to a stake and deliberately roasted to death over a slow fire; and the crowd stood calmly by, and surveyed the victim's writhing limbs, and listened to his groans of agony; yes, that mob of infernal miscreants, who would disgrace the black portals of hell itself, looked coolly on, and laughed! 
               Such is the infamous "lynch law." 
               Let us resume our narrative. 
               The warden and the parson were dragged to a neighboring tree, whose thick trunk and strong projecting branches seemed to be well adapted to the fatal purpose which the countrymen had in view. 
               One of these honest but misguided men took from his pocket a long and stout cord. A running noose was made at one end, and placed around the neck of the parson, who, it was determined, should be the first victim. 
               The other end of the cord was then thrown over one of the limbs of the tree. The arms of the poor parson having been bound with a handkerchief, the men grasped the cord, and prepared to give a "long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together." 
               The warden, meanwhile, apprehending that his turn would come next, lay upon the ground quivering with terror, and begging for mercy. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVII. 
               THE UNWELCOME BATH. 
               The Rev. Mr. Spoons, feeling assured that his time had come, suddenly became struck with the idea that he was a very great sinner, and needed some little preparation prior to being hurried into another world. There fore, he asked to be allowed the space of five minutes, for prayer. 
               This reasonable request being granted, the parson began to mutter a supplication for divine mercy, which, if not so eloquent as those which he was accustomed to deliver in the pulpit, was certainly a great deal more sincere. 
               This delay, brief as it was, proved the means of saving those men from committing the crime of murder. Their blood having time to cool, they began to ask themselves if they were not going too far in the matter, and if the consequences of the act might not prove disastrous to themselves; for lynch law does not flourish with entire impunity in the vicinity of Philadelphia. 
               The result was, that they held a whispered consultation among themselves; and came to the conclusion of abandoning their original design of putting the supposed grave-robbers to death. 
               They nevertheless determined to inflict a severe punishment upon our friends the warden and the parson, and then hand them over to justice. 
               Accordingly, Mr. Spoons was released from his unpleasant and dangerous situation, to the great joy of himself and the warden-the latter of whom saw, in his companion's liberation from the halter, an assurance of his own safety. 
               "Gentlemen," cried the delighted Mr. Spoons-"suffer me, on behalf of myself and friends, to thank you for having rectified your mistake in time, and--" 
               "Silence!" harshly interrupted one of the men, who seemed to have some influence over the rest-"silence; we don't want any thanks or explanations. As for our being mistaken, it's no such thing; you are a couple of rascally doctors, most likely; and it's lucky that the good gentleman, whom we met in the chaise, caught you in your rascality. You'll both be sent to the Eastern Penitentiary for this night's work." 
               "Would to heaven that I were in the Eastern Penitentiary now!" groaned the respectable warden of that institution. 
               "Amen!" responded the chaplain of the same agreeable edifice. 
               "The prisoner has not only made his escape, but he has also stolen my horse and chaise; for these fellows just now spoke of the gentleman whom they met in the chaise," muttered Mr. Fox. 
               "We are a pair of d-d fools," sighed Mr. Spoons. 
               The whole party having got over the church-yard wall, entered the village, and approached a large and deep pond of water situated in a vacant lot. This pond was stagnant; a green scum covered its surface, and many a gigantic bull-frog revelled in its mud, or croaked his hoarse song upon its banks. 
               The warden and the parson exchanged looks of terror, as they advanced towards the pond; for they suspected that they were doomed to become too familiarly acquainted with its sweets. All doubts on the subject were soon set at rest, when the rope which had so recently adorned the parson's neck, was securely adjusted around that gentleman's waist. 
               Mr. Spoons now made another attempt to enter into explanations; for, being a dandy who prided himself greatly upon the elegance of his dress and appearance, the prospect of being saturated and half stifled with the filthy waters of that foul ditch, was most dreadful to him. He was, however, quickly silenced by the assurance that if he objected to the punishment, he should be conveyed back to the churchyard, and strung up to the tree. So, of two evils, Mr. Spoons wisely chose the least. 
               And now was enacted a scene which would have been extremely ludicrous, could a spectator have divested himself of every feeling of pity for the hapless victim, who was the principal performer. 
               The sturdy countrymen, taking the parson up bodily, threw him headlong into the pond, and laughed as they saw him floundering in the soft and slimy mud. Whenever they thought that he was in danger of being drowned or stifled, they would bring him to the shore by violently jerking the rope that was attached to his waist; and then, as soon as he had blown the mud from his mouth and nostrils, and recovered breath, they would plunge him in again, to repeat the performance. 
               When the poor parson had become thoroughly exhausted, they released him, and transferred the rope to the waist of the warden. This gentleman, with a degree of cunning very appropriate to his name, tightly held his handkerchief to his mouth and nostrils; so that, when his tormentors threw him into the pond, he imbibed but a very small quantity of the fifth. Moreover when they drew him to the shore, he lay perfectly still, and pretended to be insensible. The countrymen, little suspecting that he was merely playing "possum," concluded that he had been sufficiently punished, and desisted. 
               Mr. Fox, finding that the ordeal was over, soon recovered from his "swoon;" and he then asked if he and his friend were at liberty to depart? The reply was a most decided negative. 
               "You don't get off so easy," said the fellow who acted as chief spokesman of the party-"a mere ducking in the pond ain't half punishment enough for such a crime as yours. You must go with us to the lockup, and in the morning Justice Beeswax will dispose of you as he thinks proper. Me and my comrades will receive the thanks of the community for bringing two such villains to justice; perhaps we may get liberally rewarded-who knows?" 
               "Ay-who knows?" echoed the others, in concert; and then, seizing Messrs Fox and Spoons in no gentle grasp, they escorted those unfortunate and ill-fated gentlemen towards the village "lock-up." 
               On their way, they stopped at the residence of the village constable, in order to arouse that high functionary, so that their proceedings might receive a sort of official sanction; for, to tell the truth, they were not without some secret misgivings as to the final result of that night's violent operations.-Being now pretty well "cooled off," they began to fear that they had gone almost too far. 
               They had another object in summoning Constable Crawl: that officer kept the key of the lock-up, and his presence was absolutely necessary to the incarceration of the prisoners. He soon made his appearance, in the person of a small, mean-looking man, with the eyes of a reptile, and a countenance suggestive of petty larceny. 
               On hearing a brief statement of the case, Constable Crawl not only approved of the conduct of the countrymen but also assured them that they would receive the thanks of the nation, for their patriotism and heroic courage in arresting the two prisoners, who (he said) were old offenders, having often been in his official grip for various crimes and misdemeanors. Thus comforted and sustained by the approbation of a distinguished pillar of the law, the fears of the countrymen vanished, and they rejoiced exceedingly. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVIII. 
               THE VILLAGE BASTILE. 
               "Fellows!" cried Constable Crawl, fiercely addressing the prisoners-"I am about to question you. Be very careful, for your answers will be brought forward in a court of justice as evidence. You look like old convicts; have you not both been in the Eastern Penitentiary?" 
               "We have been there, but not--" 
               "I thought so!" cried the constable, in a tone of triumph, and vastly delighted with his own wonderful penetration-"I thought so. You are now in a fair way to get back to your old quarters. Come-you must go to the lock-up; in the morning, the justice will settle your hash." 
               Under the formidable escort of the constable and the countrymen, Messrs. Spoons and Fox were now conducted to the village Bastile, which was a small brick edifice without any great pretensions to architectural beauty, being built somewhat in the shape of a Dutch oven. Windows there were none; but then there was an iron door of very decided appearance, and the said door was furnished with a grating to admit light and air. 
               Producing from the depths of his pocket a key, which had been keeping company with four brass quarters, a small bottle of medicine and a syringe, Constable Crawl unlocked the door of the Bastile with the inflexible air of a jailor who wasn't to be bribed, and ordered the two prisoners to enter.-They obeyed, and the door having been closed and locked upon them, Mr. Crawl and his followers departed. 
               The moonlight which shone through the grating in the door, enabled the warden and the parson to see that the dungeon, which was about ten feet square, was destitute of even an apology for a bed, and was besides so disgustingly filthy in every part, as to render it almost impossible to move an inch with defiling the person. However, the recent close intimacy of our friends with the stagnant pond had already so besmeared them, that they cared but little for the dirt of their dungeon; and accordingly they threw themselves upon the stone floor to await the arrival of the morrow, when they knew that they would experience no difficulty in gaining their liberation. 
               "It is hard," groaned the warden, as he and his companion condoled with each other upon their manifold misfortunes-"it is hard that I, who have turned a key upon so many prisoners, should now have a key turned upon me. This night's work will be the death of me, I fear; the soaking I received in that accursed pond will increase my rheumatism, and I shall be obliged to hobble on crutches for the rest of my days. Oh! why did I believe the tale of that artful young villain? To what a series of misfortunes has my blind credulity subjected me! I have been disappointed in my expectations of finding gold! I have been cast into a grave, and nearly buried alive; I have lost a life prisoner, and been robbed of a valuable horse and chaise; I have narrowly escaped being hung; and now, after having been nearly drowned in a foul ditch, I am thrust into this filthy len, to be arraigned in the morning before a magistrate, like a criminal, on the odious charge of attempting to steal a corpse! In addition to all this, I shall become a laughing-stock for every body, and perhaps lose my situation as warden. Oh, cursed fate! and oh, thrice miserable Fox!" 
               "Alas!" cried Mr. Spoons-"I also have cause to mourn, and groan in anguish of spirit. It was mainly in consequence of my persuasions that you consented to enter upon this unfortunate enterprise; otherwise we might both, at this moment, have been comfortably seated in the prison office, discussing your own particular and private Cogniac. I shall never be able to divest myself of the choking sensation produced by the infernal rope which encircled my neck; and I feel that my ducking in the pond has forever morally degraded me. But oh! worse than all-that immersion in filth-that unholy baptism in the foul waters of the "Slough of Despond," has irretrievably ruined my best suit of clothes, which, although unpaid for, were dear to my heart. Alas, too credulous tailor! I fear me much that thou art destined never to receive the dimes for the elegant productions of thy divine needle! And oh! thou too chaste washerwoman-Mrs. Suds-thou who hast so often rejected my amorous advances, can thy artistic skill ever eradicate from this foul linen these ignoble stains? Alas, poor Spoons! thou has indeed fallen from thine high estate!" 
               The lamentations of the parson were here interrupted by a voice which apparently issued from some foreign quarter of the Bastile. Upon examination, it was discovered that the strange voice proceeded from a head of forbidding aspect, and also that the eyes belonging to the said head were anxiously peering through the grating in the dungeon door. A further investigation developed the fact that the voice, head and eyes were the personal property of Mr. Constable Crawl. 
               "Hullo, you fellows in there!" said Mr. Crawl, in a tone that was intended to be condescending. 
               "What do you wish?" asked the prisoners, meekly; for a thorough soaking in a stagnant pond hath a marvellous tendency to subdue the spirit of the most valiant. 
               "I am disposed," said the great man, with an air of lofty benevolence-" to treat you with kindness; for, after all, are you not my fellow beings, made, like myself, in the image of a benificent Creator?" 
               Now this was a great concession on the part of the constable-an acknowledgement that those degraded captives belonged to the same noble species of which he, Crawl, was so superb a specimen. The warden and the parson therefore expressed their gratitude with becoming humility, although they could not help thinking that if the constable was really an image of his Creator, the said image was very indifferently executed, and must have been "got up" during and unusual press of business. 
               "Yes," continued Mr. Crawl-"although you are doubtless great villains, and worthy of the extreme penalty of the law, I will be merciful. I will batter the edge of the sword of Justice, so that it shall not utterly destroy you.-I will place a couple of brick-bats under the wheels of the Car of the Constitution of the United States, so that you may not be entirely crushed, like mashed turnips. What amount of money have you in your possession?" 
               "That is a strange question," remarked Mr. Fox-"why do yon ask?" 
               Mr. Crawl, having looked cautiously around, in order to assure himself that there were no listeners near, thrust his nose still further through the grating, and said, in a low tone- 
               "Give me ten dollars, and I will release you from confinement." 
               "You mean to say--" 
               "Exactly so. I will let you go for ten dollars, and so arrange things as to lead to the belief that you managed your own escape." 
               "Then you will accept of a bribe?" 
               "Hush! that's an ugly word; don't use it. Not a bribe, but a present you know." 
               The warden and the parson, having consulted together, concluded to accept the constables offer; for, although they were sure to be liberated in the morning, upon establishing their true identity, they preferred to avoid, as far as possible the exposure of their treasure-seeking expedition. 
               Therefore, they began to investigate their pockets, in order to make up the required sum; but soon found to their consternation, that their joint finances fell rather short of the amount necessary to "pay the turnpike toll of a walking-stick"-by which elegant simile we mean to convey the fact that neither of them was, at that moment, in possession of a single farthing; all their loose change having been paid to old Wilson, for refreshments at the road-side inn. 
               They therefore announced to Mr. Crawl their inability to comply with his demands; but that gentleman, supposing that they merely wished him to lower the "price of liberty," intimated his willingness to "let them slide" for one half the sum which he had named. 
               "Unfortunately," said Mr. Fox-"neither my friend here nor myself can immediately reward you for setting us at liberty, as we are both out of funds. However, I will pledge you my word of honor--" 
               "Gammon!" interrupted Mr. Crawl, whose ideas of honor were very obscure-"if you are such poor devils that you can't pay five dollars, you may stay in your dungeon through all eternity, for what I care." 
               So saying, the indignant and disappointed constable discharged a superannuated perannuated quid of tobacco through the grating, at the prisoners; and having in this manner soothed his injured feelings, he departed and bent his steps homeward, where he resolved to enjoy such consolation as might be derived from a mysterious looking black bottle which occupied a corner of the upper shelf in his cupboard, and whose contents emitted an odor suspiciously resembling the villainous smell of very bad brandy. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIX. 
               THE MAGISTRATE. 
               Left again "alone in their glory," the warden and the parson prepared to pass the night in as comfortable a manner as was possible in view of the wretched plight in which they found themselves. 
               It soon, however, became apparent that the privilege of repose, even in that miserable place, was to be denied them; for they were assailed by a legion of half-starved rats. These disgusting creatures came upon them in swarms, and seemed determined to banquet upon their carcasses. Messrs. Spoons and Fox were obliged to act upon the defensive, in order to preserve themselves from being actually torn in pieces by their loathsome enemies, which frequently leaped upon them in numbers, fastening their sharp teeth in the flesh of these two most unfortunate of gentleman. 
               The whole night was occupied with this description of warfare, and it was not until daylight had begun to struggle in through the grating of the dungeon door, that the invading army retreated from the field of battle 
               It seemed, however, that the rats had only retired in order to give place to another set of persecutors, who were almost equally annoying. For the report that two grave-robbers had been arrested the preceding night, had spread through the village, and before sun-rise nearly the whole population, men, women and children had repaired to the lock-up, in order to have a view of the two desperate villains who had been caught in the very act of stealing the person of a very respectable lady who had the misfortune to be dead. 
               Gathered around the door of the Bastile, the crowd pushed and struggled to obtain a peep at the supposed grave-robbers, who found themselves the objects of a curiosity that was rather annoying, particularly as the spectators were very free with their remarks. 
               "A pair of gallows birds," said one. 
               "Villainly is written in their looks," said another. 
               "They are a couple of ugly thieves," sneered a woman who rejoiced in such personal attractions as red hair, a turnup nose, and a terrific squint. 
               "I despise a thief of any kind," remarked a fellow who had recently been discharged from the Eastern Penitentiary, where he had been confined during a term of one year for robbing a blind beggar of a dollar's worth of coppers. On taking a closer view of the inmates of the Bastile, this man instantly recognised the warden of the institution from which he had so lately emerged. With a muttered exclamation of astonishment, he immediately made himself scarce. 
               "Here comes Constable Crawl!" observed some one in the crowd, as that high officer at last made his appearance with an air of dignity that struck awe and terror to the soul of every spectator. 
               "Make room, here, make room!" cried Constable Crawl; and producing the key of the Bastile, he unlocked the door, and commanded the prisoners to come forth. The warden and the parson obeyed; and, escorted by the constable, and surrounded by the rabble, they were conlucted to the office of Justice Beeswax, which was situated near. 
               The appearance of the prisoners was certainly not in their favor, they being covered with filth from head to feet; yet the prospect of their being soon released somewhat encouraged them. 
               In a few minutes the magistrate entered the office and took his seat.-Justice Beeswax was an elderly gentleman with a kind and open countenance; and he surveyed the wretched looking prisoners with an air of benevolent pity. 
               The office was crowded with the inhabitants of the village, all anxious to behold the proceedings. Conspicuous among the crowd were the six country-men who had arrested the prisoners and treated them with such extreme severity. 
               Constable Crawl, armed with his staff of office, stood near the culprits, whom he eyed with an expression of stern integrity and holy horror that was quite refreshing to behold. 
               The worthy magistrate, having adjusted his spectacles, and taken an agitated pinch of snuff, thus addressed the accused:- 
               "I am truly sorry to have two such respectable looking men brought before me on a charge so odious and so disgraceful; for, notwithstanding your filthy condition, I can readily perceive that your looks, as well as your garments, are what the world calls respectable. How came you both in your present very unclean state? Who are you, and what are your names?" 
               "My name is Jedediah Fox, and I am the warden of the Eastern Penitentiary." 
               "And I," added the parson-"am the Reverend Sylvester Spoons, the chaplain of the same institution." 
               A murmur of indignant astonishment ran around the office, excited by those apparent ridiculous falsehoods on the part of the prisoners. Mr. Crawl put on a look of lofty contempt, which did him great credit; for it is very difficult to express the feelings of contempt with a nose of the pug and rummy order, to which class the proboscis of the constable belonged. 
               The Justice, on hearing the replies of the accused, surveyed them attentively for a few moments. Then, appearing to recognize them, he started slightly, and his looks betrayed profound surprise. 
               Rising from his seat, he requested them to follow him into an adjoining room, which being done, the door was closed upon the staring crowd, who marvelled greatly at this strange proceeding. 
               "I don't understand this at all," muttered Mr. Crawl, with a look of be wilderment and chagrin. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXX. 
               THE TABLES TURNED. 
               Half an hour elapsed, during which time Messrs Fox and Spoons, both of whom were known by sight to the Justice, fully explained everything to the entire satisfaction of that excellent magistrate. 
               When Justice Beeswax and the prisoners again made their appearance in the office, great was the astonishment of the spectators to see the Justice hand the supposed culprits a couple of chairs, and request them to be seated, with an air of almost obsequious politeness! 
               "What in the devil's name can all this mean?" muttered Mr. Crawl, with much uneasiness. 
               The magistrate took his seat, and assumed an expression and tone of unusual sternness, as he said- 
               "Let the six persons who arrested these gentlemen last night. stand forward." 
               The countrymen, expecting to be publicly applauded and perhaps rewarded warded, for the valor which they had displayed, stepped from the crowd, and took their places in front of the magistrate's desk. 
               "Let a messenger be despatched for the Deputy Sheriff and a couple of constables," continued the Justice-"for we may have a number of prisoners to be taken care of, if I am not greatly mistaken." 
               On hearing this, the six countrymen glanced at each other with looks of alarm. Constable Crawl, considering that the sending for an additional constabulary force was an insult to him, as reflecting upon his own inefficiency, mustered up courage to say to the Justice- 
               "Please your honor, I can take care of the these two prisoners very well; I don't think it necessary to send for any help." 
               "Silence, sir!" thundered the magistrate-"lay down your staff of office and take your seat. I shall have something to say to you, presently." 
               Mr. Crawl obeyed, with a wondering and chop-fallen air. He couldn't understand the thing at all; yet he had a vague fear that the Justice had been made acquainted with his offer to liberate the prisoners for money. 
               Justice Beeswax now addressed the six countrymen, who stood before him with an expression of painful uncertainty stamped upon their rather sheepish-looking countenances:- 
               "My friends, I regret to say that you have placed yourselves in a very unfortunate position. These two gentlemen, whom you arrested last night, are really what they have represented themselves to be-Mr. Fox, and the Reverend Mr. Spoons, the warden and chaplain of the Eastern Penitentiary." 
               At these words, the six countrymen were astounded-Mr. Crawl was frightened, while the spectators awaited with breathless interest the denouement of this strange and mysterious affair. 
               The magistrate continued:- 
               "These gentlemen, having reason to suppose that stolen treasures were buried in our church-yard, had dug for them, little suspecting that they were intruding upon the sacred quiet of a grave. A convict in the prison, in order to accomplish a certain object, had deceived them: but they have nothing whatever to reproach themselves with, in regard to the matter." 
               The countrymen, thinking that they had now heard the worst of the affair, felt their fears vanish; and one of them, the spokesman of the party, observed to the magistrate- 
               "We are right glad, your honor, that the gentlemen are not the villains that we took them for. However, your can't say but that we did perfectly right in arresting them as we did; for we found them in very suspicious circumstances." 
               "I confess," said the Justice-"that the circumstances were suspicious-extremely so; and it was your duty, as good citizens, to arrest them. Thus far, you did perfectly right, and I commend your zeal. But what has transpired after you had arrested those gentlemen?" 
               The countrymen looked confused, and held their peace; and the magistrate continued, in a tone of severity- 
               "You seem to be forgetful of the events of last night; permit me to refresh your memories, Instead of questioning the gentlemen, in order to see what account they could give of themselves, you refused to hear one word of the explanation, which they were anxious to make. Instead of peaceably delivering them into the custody of an officer, as persons whom you believed you had detected in the commission of an unlawful and criminal act, you began by violently assaulting them, which, to say the least, considering your superior numbers, was unmanly and cowardly. Not content with this, you determined to commit a still greater outrage-an outrage which, had it been consummated, would have brought you to the same punishment as that which you designed for the two victims of your brutality. You placed the lives of these gentlemen in jeopardy; and 'tis fortunate for you, that you refrained from committing the crime of murder. But, although you concluded to spare the lives of these innocent victims of unfortunate circumstances, your insane thirst for outrage was not yet satisfied; and, dragging them to that foul and stagnant pond which is a disgrace to our village, you cast them in, the one after the other, and gloated upon their struggles for air and life, until death had nearly snatched them from the grasp of your brutality. Answer me, all of you-is this true?" 
               The countrymen had not the audacity to deny the facts so clearly stated, and each of them acknowledged that it was true. 
               At this point of the proceedings, the Deputy Sheriff and several constables entered the office. The Justice, having motioned them to remain in attendance, continued his remarks to the valiant and now trembling captors of the warden and the parson;- 
               "My duty in this case is a painful one, but it is none the less imperative on that account. I believe you to be honest, well-meaning men, who have been led into this deplorable error by angry excitement; yet, as Mr. Fox and the Rev. Mr. Spoons have entered a formal complaint against you all, for endangering their lives and also for an aggravated assault upon each of them, I have no alternative but to bind you over for trial at the next term of the Court of Sesssions. I shall require each of you to give security for your appearance, in the sum of one thousand dollars." 
               Scarcely believing the evidence of their own senses, the six countrymen, with mouth and eyes wide open, stared at the magistrate and at each other with looks of bewilderment that were very natural, considering the expectations which they had formed of receiving both approbation and reward for their valorous conduct on the preceding night. They were, soon however, aroused from their stupor, and made sensible of all the painful realities of their situation, when the Deputy Sheriff, calling them aside, inquired of them whether they could produce the required bonds for their appearance at court? 
               Being nothing but poor laboring men and as destitute of wealthy friends as poor laboring men almost invariably are, not one of them could get bail; and consequently they were carried off and provided with accommodations in the county jail; there to await their trial-a warning to all those rash and hot-headed republicans who descant on the propriety and justice of an indignant populace "taking the law into their own hands." 
               This matter being disposed of, Justice Beeswax turned to Constable Crawl, and sternly said to that high-minded and incorruptible functionary, who seemed to be about as much at his ease as though he were seated upon a bed of hot coals- 
               "So, sir, it seems that you are in the habit of proposing to release prisoners, on condition of their rewarding your kindness by making you presents!-In other words, you are not only willing but anxious to accept of bribes. I have long suspected you of this rascality; and I now fully understand the heretofore mysterious manner in which so many prisoners have disappeared from the lock-up. Leave the office, sir; I shall take good care that from this day henceforth you never again occupy the office of constable." 
               Mr. Crawl crawled off with a very miserable and sheepish air; and Justice Beeswax announced to the auditors that they might retire, the business of the office being concluded. 
                
               The warden and the parson, having thanked the worthy magistrate for the justice which he had done them, obtained a conveyance to the prison, where they arrived in safety after so many strange and perilous adventures. 
               Thus ended the treasure-seeking exdepition of Messrs. Spoons and Fox. This portion of our narrative is not an exaggeration, but is strictly fonnded on truth in all its essential details. Of later years, a convict in the Massachusetts State Prison successfully carried out a somewhat similar "game," but he was afterwards re-captured. 
               We may as well here state that the six countrymen who had so severely maltreated the warden and the parson, were are all convicted, on trial, of aggravated assault, and they were each and severally sentenced to one year's imprisonment in the Eastern Penitentiary. Consequently, they were made partakers of the hospitality of Mr. Fox, and also had the satisfaction of listening to the spiritual teachings of the Rev. Mr. Spoons; but we doubt very much whether their introduction, as prisoners, to their former victims of the stagnant pond, contributed greatly to the comfort of their situation, while inmates of the "Solitary Prison." 
               We now return to Jack Harold, whom we left on his way to the roadside inn, and to the arms of pretty Mary Wilson-after having possosssed himself of a horse and chaise, and gained, what was of far greater importance-his liberty.
                
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXI. 
               THE GUILTY LOVERS. 
               Like a faithful and impartial animal as he was, the good steed of Mr. Fox trotted away as cheerfully and as rapidly under the guidance of the escaped prisoner, as when the warden himself, the legitimate owner, held the reins. 
               The little road-side inn, with its swinging sign, soon "hove in sight," as the sailors say; and Jack, having leaped out of the chaise and fastened the horse in an obscure and convenient place, approached the inn, which was now closed for the night. 
               Recollecting the directions which the pretty Mary Wilson had given him, nearly a year previously, Jack glanced up at the windows with the white curtains which served to indicate her chamber. A light was faintly gleaming from that chamber, and the shadow of a human form moving about assured our hero that the young girl had not retired to rest. 
               "She is expecting me, that beautiful creature!" murmured Jack; and a thrill of delight tingled through his frame, as he anticipated the raptures which he was to enjoy in the society of the charming girl. 
               Going around to the stable, he found a ladder that was well adapted to the purpose. This he conveyed to the front of the house, and having placed it in the proper position, he ascended, and with a beating heart tapped lightly upon the window. 
               Instantly the curtain was drawn aside, the window softly raised, and then Jack's lips were pressed to those of the beautiful Mary. 
               With a low exclamation of delight, the young girl assisted her convict lover into her chamber; then, having drawn the curtain and closed the window, she threw herself into our hero's arms, and fairly sobbed for joy. 
               Mary's chamber was a perfect bijou of neatness and comfort; and although luxury had no part in its arrangements, there prevailed a quiet elegance which denoted a refined and womanly taste, while the voluptuous bed, with its snowy drapery, would not have disgraced the sleeping apartment of the "highest lady in the land." 
               In one corner stood a table spread with all the essentials for an excellent supper, together with a couple of bottles of wine, whose dusty appearance indicated their ripe age. In the well-stocked cellar of old Wilson, these jovial twins had slumbered for many years, until their sparkling contents had acquired that delicious flavor which alone can render wine fit to be "the drink of the gods." 
               After a prolonged and passionate embrace, the lovers-for such we may now call them-seated themselves upon the sofa; for Mary's apartment, unpretending as it was, contained that very convenient and cosy article of furniture. 
               As the happy girl sat with her graceful form encircled by the arms of our hero, she surveyed him with looks of mingled curiosity and admiration. 
               "Ah!" she murmured-"now that I can view thee without interruption, I find thee even handsomer than I had supposed. 'Tis a bliss that I have long anticipated with impatience; for I knew that thou wouldst escape from captivity. Some mysterious but infallible instinct assured me of it." 
               "Dear Mary, when you first saw me to-night, in the custody of my two guards, did you have any hope that I should be able to elude their vigilance?" 
               "I was so sure of it, that I made every preparation for thy reception," answered the young girl, who, having been brought up in a Quaker family, had acquired the peculiar dialect of the Friends, which dialect she unconsciously used; and never did the Quakerish thee and thou fall more musically from rosy lips. 
               As Mary spoke, she pointed to the well-spread table; and gently urging her lover towards it, placed a chair for him. Jack, nothing loth, seated himself, and began to discuss, with a keen appetite, the excellent viands which proclaimed so eloquently the superiority of mine host's larder. A year's subsistance on the coarse diet of a prison, had well qualified Jack to enjoy such luxuries as cold roast fowl, beef, ham, pickled oysters, delicate pastry, preserves, and a variety of domestic and topical fruits. 
               A few glasses of the generous wine soon elevated the spirits of the young Outlaw to the highest degree of happiness. Mary also drank of the purple juice; but sparingly, for 
                      
                        "The modest maid 
                        But coyly sips, and blushing drinks, abash'd." 
                     
                  
                
               "Alas!" sighed Jack, as a sudden feeling of sorrow oppressed his heart-"after all, dear Mary, this meeting, which seems so joyous, can be productive of nothing but unhappiness to us both; and I almost regret having sought your sweet presence, for this hour of bliss will but enhance the agony of our separation." 
               "Heavens! why dost thou talk of separation?" demanded the enamoured young girl, in affright-"are we not united forever?" 
               "Would that it could be so! but 'tis impossible. Long before day-light I must be on my way to a distant place; to linger in this vicinity, even although blest with your sweet smiles, would be madness-for large rewards will be offered, and every effort made, to effect my re-capture. I must not risk my liberty, which I have gained with so much difficulty." 
               "Yet we need not part-nay, I swear that we shall not; for I will be the companion of thy flight, the sharer of thy hardships and thy dangers," cried the young girl, with determination. 
               Jack strained her closely to his breast as he exclaimed- 
               "Noble, generous girl, I will not basely take advantage of your heroic and confiding nature, by consenting to so great a sacrifice on your part. Can I suffer you to leave the comforts of a virtuous and happy home, in order that you may become the sharer of my desperate fortunes? Never! I am an Outlaw, but in spite of my many crimes, there yet dwells within my breast a principle of honor; and, to prove its existence," continued Jack, as he arose from his seat-"I shall now take my instant departure from this place, leaving your virgin purity unassailed; for 'twas to rob you of that purity that I came here. Fair girl, adieu; you shall never become a sufferer by a villainous act of mine!" 
               As Jack (who spoke with the most perfect sincerity and truth,) advanced towards the window for the purpose of leaving the chamber, the beautiful Mary threw her arms around his neck to detain him, while, in the most impassioned accents she said- 
               "Thou shalt not go and thus deprive me of the society of the only being whom I have ever loved. I must accompany thee, or die; thy refusal will force me to commit the dreadful crime of suicide!" 
               Jack shuddered, and pressed the infatuated girl closely to his throbbing heart. She continued- 
               "Think not that my love for thee is as the lightning's flash, which blazes for a moment and is gone. 'Tis enduring as eternity itself. And imagine not that in following thy fortunes, I shall forsake a happy home. The cruelty of my father has long tempted me to deser this roof, which is to me naught but the abode of misery. Let me accompany thee and cling to thee forever; and any sacrifice that thou mayst require of me, for thy pleasure and gratification, shall be cheerfully yielded." 
               Who could have resisted the soft pleadings of that enamored girl, whose exciting words were accompanied by glances the most passionate and caresses the most voluptuous? Not our hero, who exclaimed- 
               "Be it so! Since you are determined, sweet girl, to quit the protection of your tyrant father, we will sink or swim together. Come, dear Mary-let us devote one little hour to love and then we'll start on our journey in search of happiness and fortune." 
               The youthful and criminal pair exchanged an impassioned glance, and the drapery of the couch formed a curtain which will, for a brief season, shroud them both from the gaze of the author and his readers. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXII. 
               THE ROBBERY AND MURDER. 
               An hour elapsed; an hour which, in the chamber of that unpretending roadside inn, was perhaps fraught with joys as delirious and as sinful as any that ever contaminated the holy season of Night, within the luxurious precincts of a ducal palace. 
               From the soft embraces of that now polluted couch issued the guilty pair; the youth, with an expression of triumph gleaming in his splendidly wicked countenance-the maid (that was) with the blush of shame upon her cheek, yet with a subdued glance of gratified passion in her eyes. 
               "Come," cried our hero-' it will soon be daylight, and it is nigh time that we were on the move. Let us start at once." 
               "Stay a moment," said the girl, who, at her lover's suggestion, had now abandoned the Quaker dialect, as being liable to lead to her detection. "Stay, until we have put on our disguises." 
               "Our disguises!" 
               "Yes. I must now tell you that in anticipation of our flight, I have prepared suitable costumes for us, in order that we may pass through the country without exciting suspicion. The clothing is plain, but appropriate. Here it is." 
               So saying the thoughtful Mary went to her bureau and took from thence two entire suits of clothing which were, in truth, well adapted to the purpose in view. The garments were plain but respectable; and, when arrayed in his suit, Jack looked like a sober young country gentleman of the better class. His appearance might have proclaimed him to be the son of some very wealthy farmer. 
               The clothing of the girl was also of the masculine order. When duly arrayed, she presented the aspect of a rustic but unusually handsome boy, whose careful mother had neatly arrayed him for a visit to his relatives. 
               Having finished dressing, the pair were about to take their departure through the widow, when Jack suddenly paused, and seemed to be struck with an idea. 
               "I am unfortunately out of funds," said he-"and in an emergency like the present, when we are about to travel and incur many necessary expenses we should endeavor to provide ourselves with the needful, at all risks-even if we are obliged to rob our nearest relatives. What think you, dear Mary?" 
               "I understand you," replied the young girl-"and approve of your suggestion; for my father has no claims of duty upon me. He has considerable money in the house, and I well know where he keeps it." 
               "That is capital; such old rascals always know how to accumulate the dimes. But pardon me for speaking thus of your--" 
               "He is my father no longer; I have long ceased to regard him as such. There will be considerable risk in securing the money; but I do not fear. I will go to his chamber, while you remain here to await my return." 
               "Nay, I will accompany you. Lead the way, and I will follow. In case of discovery, I must be near to aid you; for otherwise, should the old devil chance to awaken, he would murder you." 
               "That is true," said the girl, with a shudder; and then, requesting her lover to follow, she passed out of the chamber and stood in the passage way to listen. 
               All being silent, save the welcome sound of a distant snore, which was rendered in the deepest possible bass Mary noiselessly descended a flight of stairs and paused before the door of a room from which, with increased volume issued the nasal music. 
               "Here is where my father sleeps," said the young girl to her lover. 
               Jack tried the door and found that it was not locked. 
               "Let us enter," whispered he-"the old man sleeps soundly. Should he awaken and interfere with my proceedings, he shall sleep a deeper and longer sleep than any he ever enjoyed before. Come!" 
               "Surely," said Mary, in a low and agitated tone-"you would not commit murder?" 
               "Our safety above everything else. Follow me!" 
               They entered the chamber. 
               A light was burning dimly upon the table. On a mean and uncurtained bed lay the portly form of old Wilson the inn-keeper. His red, bloated face and carbuncled nose, contrasted with the white pillows, looked like a huge coal of fire sizzling in a bank of snow; and the music which that carbuncled nose discoursed, resembled the reverberations of distant thunder. Close to the bed-side was a chair supporting a bottle of liquor and a tumbler-affording evidence that the old man, during his intervals of wakefulness throughout the night, was accustomed to indulge in his favorite potations and thereby renew his intimacy with the drowsy god. 
               With old Wilson, his "ruling passion" seemed to be strong in sleep; for, with all the characteristic pertinacity of a veteran rum-seller, he would occasionally mutter-"Won't trust; liquor costs money; owe for two glass es already. Where's my daughter? D-n her, I'll beat her to death; she won't wait on the customers--" 
               And here a terrific snore would interrupt the muddy current of the old man's alcoholic ideas. 
               "Where does this wretch keep his money?" inquired our hero in accents of strong disgust. 
               "In a large chest beneath his bed; the keys are under his pillow." 
               Jack cautiously thrust his hand under the pillow and drew forth a bunch of keys, one of which he found fitted a large and somewhat heavy box that was placed beneath the bed of the unconscious sleeper. 
               This box having been softly drawn from its hiding place, our hero opened it, and to his inexpressible delight, he found that it contained a sum money, in gold and bank-notes, not far short of a thousand dollars. 
               While hastily transferring the money to his pockets, he unfortunately dropped a heavy purse of specie upon the floor, and the chinking metal created a considerable noise. 
               The young robber mutter a deep curse. 
               The old man awoke. 
               The girl uttered a piercing scream. 
               "Murder! thieves! help! murder!" yelled the inn-keeper, whose dread of losing his money, instantly overcame his fears of the robber; and, leaping out of bed, he seized Jack by the throat. 
               A terrific struggle ensued. Old Wilson was a portly, powerful man, but he was scarcely a match for his young and vigorous antagonist, who also possessed a considerable knowledge of pugilism. In a "rough and tumble" encounter of this kind, however, brute strength perhaps tells to a far greater advantage than pugilistic skill. 
               The young girl, half frightened out of her senses, stood a horrified looker on. 
               Both the combatants fought for a great personal object:-the inn-keeper to preserve his hoarded wealth, and the robber to secure his liberty. 
               Having succeeded in laying old Wilson prostrate upon the floor, Jack was preparing to follow up his advantage by throttling his adversary, when the latter suddenly caught the thumb of our hero between his teeth, and bit it fairly off 
               Maddened by the intense pain produced by this unexpected amputation, the young robber seized the brandy bottle from the chair, and with it struck a most tremendous blow upon the innkeepers head. The blow fractured the skull, and caused the instant death of the unfortunate man. 
               For a few minutes, the murderer contemplated the corpse of his victim with the deepest feelings of horror; for he had not anticipated the perpetration of a crime so black and so appalling. 
               The daughter of the murdered man, on seeing the brains of her parent scattered over the floor, fell senseless. 
               Jack soon recovered from the state of stupefaction into which he had been thrown by the consciousness of the awful crime which he had committed; for his soul had become too familiar with the blackness of guilt, to admit of his being permanently affected, even by such a bloody deed. 
               "He brought it upon himself," muttered he-" curse him! the thumb of my right hand is gone, and that mark will serve to point me out whenever a description is given of my person. Besides, I shall never again be able to pick a pocket with my accustomed grace and professional skill." 
               Having stopped the effusion of blood, and dressed his mutilated hand as well as possible, Jack secured all the murdered man's money about his person, and then addressed himself to the task of restoring Mary Wilson to a state of consciousness. 
               This being effected, the young girl gazed at the corpse of her father, and shuddered. 
               "Gracious God! this is terrible!" she murmured, as she cast upon her criminal lover a glance of fear. 
               "Twas a deed of necessity. Come, it is time for us to take our departure." 
               "But I cannot go while the remains of my father are--" 
               "Listen to me, girl," interrupted Jack, sternly-"you must at once throw aside these feelings of weakness, or we part now, and forever. My safety must not be compromised by a foolish indulgence in unavailing regret. My criminal pursuits may often demand the shedding of blood. If you cannot endure such sights, without manifesting feelings of horror and fear, then you are no companion for me. I leave this place at once; you can remain, if you choose." 
               "I will go with you," said the young girl sadly-"I have advanced too far to recede. Henceforth, I resign myself to a dark and ruinous fate, which seems inevitable. Let us go." 
               "Bravo, Moll! you are a girl after my own heart, after all. Your desperate frame of mind well becomes the mistress of a bold Outlaw. Come, courage, dear girl! a glorious career is before us. In some one of the cities of the West, we will lead a life of pleasure and luxury that will shame the regal splendor of princes! Long hours of voluptuous dalliance-the midnight feast-the masquerade-theopera-splendid apparel-these and a thousand others are the delights which shall console us for the hardships we may have to endure, the dangers we may encounter. These are the celestial joys which shall efface from our memories the remembrance of every deed of blood!" 
               "Oh!" cried the young girl, completely carried away by the excitement produced by the infernal eloquence of her criminal lover-"there is a dangerous, but delightful and seductive fascination in your words which I cannot resist; and would not, if I could! Take me where you please, do with me as you will; henceforth, I am yours, body and soul. Command, and I will obey; I am your mistress, your adorer, your slave!" 
               And there, in that bloody chamber-the scene of robbery and murder-there, in the ghastly presence of death, did that guilty pair seal the devilish compact of their co-partnership in crime, by indulging in a long and delirious embrace; the murderer, unawed by the presence of his victim's mangled remains-the girl, unrestrained by the close proximity of her father's corpse! 
               It was a scene such as devils would have delighted to contemplate-lust, robbery and murder, all congregated together! 
               And demons, in their dark and lurid home, must have celebrated with infernal orgies and a diabolical festival, the terrible events of that Night of Crime! 
                      
                        "To what gulfs 
                        A single deviation from the track 
                        of human duties leads!" 
                     
                  
                
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXIII. 
               THE HIGH SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY. 
               It was nearly day-light when the criminal pair issued from the road-side inn. The sky was obscured by dark clouds, and a light but penetrating rain was falling. 
               "Curse the rain!" muttered Jack-" it will probably defeat my plan for removing all traces of the crime. Although I have set fire to the house in several places. it will never burn in this shower." 
               On repairing to the spot where he had left the warden's horse and chaise, Jack found all secure; and, congratulating himself on having such a convenient means of conveyance, he and the disguised young gir entered the vehicle and drove rapidly towards Philadelphia. 
               When they entered the city, it was broad day-light, and many people were abroad, none of whom suspected that the two occupants of the chaise, who seemed to be a comely, sedate looking young man and a handsome country boy, were in reality a murderer and his mistress flying from the scene of a most terrible crime. 
               Jack drove quickly through the streets and approached one of the huge bridges which cross the Schuylkill. This bridge was the same one that had been the scene of his daring exploit, when he leaped into the river in order to escape from his pursuers-an adventure which, the reader will recollect, resulted in his being re-captured. 
               Having crossed the bridge, the gallant and faithful steed, under the guidance of his new master, dashed at a spanking pace along the great turnpike road which extends through the entire State of Pennsylvania to Pittsburg, and beyond that city, to Ohio. 
               At noon they stopped to take some refreshments at rather a stylish tavern, the landlord of which happened to be the High Sheriff of that county. This gentleman being blessed with rather more than the usual average amount of curiosity, was very inquisitive; and, while the two travellers were at dinner, he began to persecute them with all sorts of inquiries, as to who they were? where did they come from? where going? what was their business? and a host of other questions which many people would have considered not only as unnecessary, but also as highly impertinent. 
               "I'll tell you what, Mr. What's your-name, I am usually regarded as a very polite person; but, if you persist in your cross-examination, I shall be reluctantly compelled to insinute that my affairs are none of your d-d business." 
               "But I am the High Sheriff of the county," said the landlord, pompously. 
               "If you were the High Sheriff of Hell, you should not insert that ugly snout of yours into any concern in my possession-except one. What is the reckoning?" 
               The indignant Boniface having named the amount of his charges, it was paid, although the bill was very extortionate. 
               Meanwhile, the horse which Jack had borrowed from the warden, had been taken care of by the ostler. As our hero and his disguised mistress re-seated themselves in the chaise, Boniface stood in the tavern porch and surveyed the horse with a keen gaze and somewhat of an astonished air. 
               "By Jupiter!" he suddenly exclaimed-"if that horse ain't the property of Mr. Fox, warden of the Eastern Penitentiary, I'll give my head for a football! Why, Fox has put up at this tavern hundreds of times, and I know the animal as well as I know my own nose!" 
               The worthy landlord's acquaintance with his own nose reflected but little credit upon him as a gentleman of respectability and moral uprightness, inasmuch as the said nose was of a dissolute, not to say rummy appearance; in fact, it was what might be termed a dissipated nose, notwithstanding that it was the property of the "High Sheriff of the county!" 
               "Young men," continued the landlord-" how came you in possession of Mr. Fox's horse?" 
               "You are mistaken; the animal belongs to me," said Jack, disdainfully. 
               The ostler here spoke up, and corroborated the statement of his master; asserting, with many oaths, that the horse was the property of Mr. Fox, and had been for years. 
               A crowd, attracted by this altercation, here began to gather around the disputants; and Jack, fearful of being detained or arrested on suspicion suddenly denly started the animal into a swift gallop, leaving Boniface and his auditors to make their own comments and form their own opinions. 
               This incident left a very disagreeable impression on the mind of our hero, for he feared that the landlord's recognition of the warden's house might furnish a clue to the latter gentleman in regard to the direction taken by the escaped prisoner; and then to this escaped prisoner might be traced the robbery and murder of old Wilson. 
               With this view of the case, Jack resolved to part with the horse, and change the disguises of himself and companion, as soon as possible. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXIV. 
               THE HIGHWAY ROBBERY. 
               The afternoon was declining into evening. The rain had ceased, and the last rays of the setting sun faintly gilded with the hues of crimson and gold, the fleecy clouds that floated in the western horizon. 
               Jack Harold and his mistress, seated in the chaise, were proceeding leisurely along in a most lonely part of the road, hoping soon to arrive at some tavern or farmhouse which would afford them accommodations for the night. 
               On gaining the summit of an elevation of considerable height, our travellers were enabled to command a view of the surrounding country for miles around; and not a single house was visible. 
               "What a desolate spot!" exclaimed our hero-"and how suitable for a deed of robbery and crime! Dick Turpin, mounted on his 'bonnie Black Bess,' would have selected this spot, above all others, to be the scene of one of his daring and romantic exploits. Ah! those were the good old days in England, when highwaymen thrived, and were regarded as heroes, instead of criminals!" 
               Mary was about to reply, when the noise of approaching wheels was heard, and soon a carriage, drawn by two fine horses, emerged from a small wood which bordered the road, a short distance ahead. 
               "By heavens!" cried Jack-"here is an opportunity to open the campaign. I shall stop that coach, and rob its inmates!" 
               "But if there should be a number of persons, you will be overpowered," said the young girl, as a shade of anxiety crossed her pretty countenance; and this anxiety arose more on her lover's account, than her own. 
               "If the coach contains a dozen men I am determined to make the attempt," was the careless reply of the bold young Outlaw, in whose eyes danger of any kind possessed a peculiar degree of fascination. 
               The girl replied not, but gazed upon her lover with a look which indicated the extent of her admiration and the profound depth of her passion for him. 
               When the coach had approached to within a short distance, Jack stopped his horse in the middle of the road, and then leaped from the chaise, followed by his paramour. 
               It was now nearly dark, and every object was enveloped in obscurity. 
               The coachman, being one half asleep and the other half drunk, had not observed the approach of the chaise; and he was suddenly aroused from his drowsy condition, by the rearing and plunging of his horses, caused by Jack's powerful grasp upon the reins. 
               "Hullo, what the devil's this?"-growled Jehu, who was a fat, lubberly fellow; and, not immediately perceiving the cause of the difficulty, he began to ply his whip with all the activity of which such a corpulent and lazy subject was capable. 
               At this moment the window of the carriage was thrust open, a head looked forth, and a voice exclaimed, in tones of extreme impatience and irritation- 
               "What is the trouble, Dobson? Do get on, for heaven's sake; for I must be in Philadelphia to-night, on the most important business." 
               Jack started with surprise; for it seemed to him that the voice of the traveller in the coach sounded strangely familiar. 
               "Please yer Excellency," replied the bewildered coachman-"some person is at the horses' heads, and I'm afraid that we're beset by robbers. Oh, dear-oh, dear! I shall be murdered, as sure as my name's Toby Dobson!" 
               By this time the horses had become perfectly quiet, and poor Dobson was too much frightened to attempt to urge them forward. 
               "Rascal!" cried the gentleman in the coach-"who do you think would have the presumption to rob me, the Governor of the Commonwealth? You are drunk, sir, and have mistaken the finger-post for a foot-pad. Be careful, or I'll discharge you. Drive on!" 
               But it so happened that the coachman couldn't drive on, for the very excellent reason that he was sprawling in the midst of the road, having been dragged from the coach-box by Jack, who quieted him by the assurance that if he made the least noise he should be murdered on the spot. 
               While the disguised young girl attended to the horses, in order to keep them quiet-a task of which she was perfectly capable, being an inn-keeper's daughter-our hero presented himself at the window of the coach, and thus addressed the traveller, who was really the Governor of the State:- 
               "Your Excellency, my name is Jack Harold. You may possibly remember that upon one occasion, when you paid a visit to the Eastern Penitentiary, you found me an inmate of one of the cells, sentenced for life. Your Excellency saw fit to address me in the language of insult, and I then ventured to assure you that we should meet again, under the free sky of heaven, when I should have just five short words to say to you. That time has come; and those five words are these-'YOUR MONEY OR YOUR LIFE!'" 
               Vain would it be to attempt a description of the Governor's fright; he was alone in the carriage, and well knew that he could not depend for assistance upon Dobson, the coachman Besides, he knew not but that the young highwayman was desperately armed, and attended by a dozen or twenty other robbers. 
               Therefore, with a heavy heart and a deep groan of anguish, His Excellency produced and handed over a pocketbook apparently well lined, and what seemed to be a valuable gold watch. 
               Having cut the horses' traces, in order to prevent an immediate pursuit, Jack bade the Governor an affectionate good night, and then, followed by his mistress, leaped into the chaise. 
               Away sped the guilty lovers, at almost lightning speed, along the now moon-lighted road; for, by this time, bright Luna had begun her celestial journey, shedding a radiance as brilliant and as pure as that upon which fair Juliet gazed, when first she linked the thought of that soft light with Love and Romeo! 
                
               We must now bid the reader a temporary adieu; but, should he feel an interest in the fortunes of our various characters, and in the final end of our crime-stained hero, he will perhaps accompany us through the concluding Tale of the series-to be entitled.
