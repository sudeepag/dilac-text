M~ DEAR READER:
We meet again. One, of whom Carlyle saith
that he was "the greatest soul in, a England," said
of his great WQrk, that it was written, "not in the soft
obscurities of retirement, nor under the shade of' ~,a-
demic bowers; but amid inconvenience and distraeti~n,
in sickness and in sorrow." If he could thus apologize
for possible imperfection, will you not have patience
with the shortcomings of

find use, did she remorselessly cram into the over-
stuffed receptacles. 'The avenues to these were worn
much in the same way, II fancy, as The marble monu~
ments of the Holy City by the kisses of ever-thronging
pilgrims. . Was any thing lost? You might "qualify"
(as they say in Virginia) that it or its counterpart
would come "forth, in visible resurrection, at her all-
potent conjuration.
On sundry days, during every week, you might see
her, with her gown Wost unroman4cally tucked up, and
hanging around her like a gaff-topsail when the sheet
has parted, mopping the floor which, to the ken of less
sharp-sighted mortals, was already immaculate. 'Where.-

mislaid; and the storm was long in subsiding. On
these occasions, Ann West would put on as martyr-like
a look, as I have seen reformers wear at a county

And then ! in the morning, at cock-crowing, might
her voice be heard, high-upraised in matin shrillness. I
hear it now.

cheek. The words that begin this chapter were the
last shots of the belligerents. I slink sulkily away,
conscience-smitten, all abashed; yet smarting under the
sense of arbitrary power unjustly exerted. She had
hid my ball, and she seemed to enjoy the sense of
superiority and control. How I dreaded my father's
coming! He entered, and, with the 'care-worn look of
a busy day, passed me without notice, and went directly
to the office'.. Ann' West followed him, and my first
impulse was to follow her and defend myself. Pride
said-
"No; if he will listen to ,4er, and condemE me un-
heard, so be it. It is but another flogging."
It was an unlucky day, that, for my father.' A bale
of' his best goods had been carelessly dropped from the
gangway-plank, in discharging "The Eriipress" at the
wharf. Fogg &amp; Gibson had failed, and rumour said that
claims against them would not pay. forty cents on the
dollar. Henry Parker, the best of his teamsters, had
got drunk, and lamed Dash, his favourite horse; and it
is, therefore, no matter of marvel that he was not very
well prepared'to sit in judgment on the grave complaint
so unexpectedly presented. I was ca~Iled to the office.
"Come here, sir!"
I obeyed.
"What have you been doing ?"
"Ann hid my ball, and"-~---
"Oh-h-h-h I"' exclaimed Ann, ~ Ia 'Kemble. "I don't
know nothing' about his ball. I"-
"Aiid so you threw the gridiron at her ?"
"No, sir;~.only the shears."
"* Did you hide his ball, Ann ?"
"I'm sure I"-
"She did, father !"
"Hush! Go and cut a stick."
I obeyed-and was flogged. Oh! how the memory
~of" my logging stings me, even now! But the fault,
my dear reader, was not my father's. It belonged to
4h~ day. 'It was the regime of the~ rod, and I do. not

(God forbid me that I should!) write a reproachful
word of him' at whose feet, were he alive, I would gladly.
kneel and beg to be; forgiven. He was one of ~he
world's great hearts; generous, honest, .unsuspecting,
warm-hearted; full of all noble and manly impulses. He
was tall, and of commanding presence; soni~what in-
dined to corpulency. He was well-formed and erect ~
and his native energy gave a fine expression to his well-
cut and somewhat remarkable features. He was im-
pulsive, yet ever benevolent, considerate, and just; yet
he was not self-trustful enough to appear to others, unless
they knew him well, in his true character. Hence he~
was sometimes thought haughty and proud; thc~ugh
never overbearing.
I crept away that night to my bed, sobbing in the
bitterness of boyish grief. It was long ere I s!ept, and
my pillow was drenched with tears. At length II rose,
dressed, and went to the office.
"Father !" I said, timidly.
"Be oft' to bed, sir !" was the reply.
I had gone to him with my heart full, penitent,
longing to tell him why I had quarrelled with the ho~ise-
keeper. I did not know then, as I know now, of that
day's catalogue of misfortunes. Was it a marvel that
the warm current of good feelings was frozen into tear-
less anger and indignant rebellion? To this feeling
succeeded calmness. With calmness came reflection~;
and, as I reviewed the scenes of The day, and 'of 'recent
life, boyhoodd does not look far 'back,) and recalled'my
father's kindness, I wept bitterly. Sorrow does not
long brood over young hearts. I fell asleep.
When I awoke next morning, I looked out at the
narrow window of my little chamber: the sash was
covered with snow. The day was just breaking. I
sprang eagerly from my bed. I remember giving a
delighted glance at my skates, which my father had
given me a. few days before, and promising myself a
merry winter. Going down to the sitting-room, I raked
open the coals in the huge fireplace, (those were the

primitive days of BoyThton,) and built what we called,
in those days, "a rousing fire." There was a recess
on the eastern side of the room, which my father al-
ways directed "the hired man" to keep filled with
wood; and, as the wood for that winter had providently
been cut a year previously, it was but a few moments
'before I had the room comfortably warm.
As I was trying on my cap, my father came in.
"Ah! Lyxide; so you've beaten me this morning ?"
and he bent over me and kissed me. "You are up
early. How do you propose to spend the day, J4nde ?"
"1 don't know, sir.
"Is there any school ?"
"No, sir."
"Would you like to go with me t~ Fairfield ?"
I hesitated.
".1 would rather go and see Mrs. Warren," I said,
at length, seeing that he waited for my decision.
"I could have sworn it," said my father, a little bit-
terly. "You love your father and mother Warren, as
you~ call them, better than you do me, I'm afraid."
I hung my head, and made no reply~
"Would you cry, if I refused ?"
sir.
"Well, you may go and spend Thanksgiving with
them. Let me see. To-day~s the twenty-third--4he

"Paul will be here this morning."
"Sure enough. There he is, now."

PAUL WAUREN.-I3UNDLING UP.-THE RID1~.
I LOOKED out at the window. There was Warren..
lie was a labourer; one of the true nobility of "this
work-day world." Well is it called so; and Shaks~
peare can hardly have been the first to give it the
happy appellation. A great deal more thab. six-sevenths
of the suns that make up the circle of the year, look
continually upon the plodding of toil; and. night often
has few hours of rest fof it. By far the Jarger portion
of "the great family" have fulfilled, most literally, the
doom of *labour-a doom wherein, if our mothei~earth
were accursed for the sins of her children, she hath in
meekness turned her cheek to the smiter; while she
hath overwhelnied- us with blessings. How few of her
millions have left us their names or histories to swell the
"Short and simple annals of' the poor !"
Paul Warren was not one who talked much about
labour. He had not learned the fashionable phrases in'
which many "a brave stringer of words" has sought to
deify it. He was a practical worker, worth whole re-
giments of its rhetorical eulogi~ts.
I see him now as I jaw him then. His 'homely
teamster's hat (a hat is one of the first things that
* catch your eye in looking at a man) was, the least in
the world, set aside from the perpendicular. towards
the right ear. His black eye sparkled, and his cheek
was flushed with his morning's walk; (he had ceme
three miles, through the snow, fr~tn his mountain~girt
cabin;) and the ends of his long, raven hair were covered
with the . half-melted snow. His usual smile li~ up his

* intelligent face as he laid his long birchen whip across
the necks of the oxen, as if some pleasant thought
of Mary Warren and her rosy-cheeked children had
crossed his mind. I could watch him no longer: I
know not how I could do it so long. I bounded from
the door, and plunging through the snow, which had
fallen, already, to the depth of more than a fOOtr I
leaped upon his back just as he was placing an axe, in
a hole cut purposely for it, in the, rail of the huge
lumber-sled.
"Hello! Lynde, my boy! long life to you !"
And the teamster hugged me in his brawny arms
with the heartiness that characterized all his actions.
"' By the powers! Lynde," (it was his favourite af-
firmation,) "I'm glad to see you. Why, it's a week, my
boy, since you've been to see us! Good morning,
Uncle George." (Everybody, almost, called my father
so.) "I think we'll have to make a lumberman ~'
Lynde."
"I shall be glad if we are ever able to make any
thing half so good of him," replied my father. He
lacked trust, reader. It 'was one of his few faults; and
there were few who would admit that George Weiss
had any faults.,
"Never you fear that, Uncle George. Never you
fear! Give him to me, if you don't want him."
"I suppose I might as well do so, Paul," said my
father; "for you've bewitched the boy, in the moun-
tains. I believe he would rather stay there than at
home with me."'~
"To be sure he would; for".-.
He said the remainder 0r the sentence in so low a
tone that I could not hear; but I was sure I knew the
import of it. I did prefer living with Paul' Warren
and his excellent wife to remaining at home with my
father and sisters. Nor was this at all a matter of
itnarvel. I had lost my mother in early infancy. For
several years succeeding that calamity-the worst that
can happen 'to a ~hild~-'J had been under the care of

Paul and Mazy Warren, in their romantic home amoiig
the mountains. There, I had never heard an angry
tone, never seen an angry look, or a blow in chastise-
ment. , There, I was sure of kindness, uniform and
constant. There, I had found one to whom I was dear~
~and who loved me (woman-like) all the more .for my
great and irretrievable misfortune. There,, a hearty
smile, a kiss, an embrace, or, what is better, a genuine
maternal hug, (that's the good old Danish word for 'it,
worth a thousand classical substitutes,) was ever my
welcome. There were no arms in which my bruises
(I was, always falling headlong) were so , soon robbed
of their pain; none wherein the storm of soieams ~tnd
sobs was so gently, lulled to stillness, rest, peacefulness
and sleep. My playthings were cared for religiously.
Neither Charles nor Ruth Warren,-.-not the youngestt.
children even, (there were seven of them all,)-.were a1~~
lowed to molest Old Troy,. 'the dog, because ii loved
him. Was there any species of food that I expressed
a preference for? It was sure to be. near my plate.
Your pardon, reader. I should extend the descrip-'
tion to pages, were I sure that any words of mine could
make Mary Warren stand before you in fresh, loving,
matronly, pure, religious LIFE, as she is now present to
me,-.as she has been present to me, waking and in my.
dreams, in many a clime of t~ie earth.
"What shall I do to-day ?" asked Warren~
"As to-day is Saturday, Paul, you had best spend ~t
in getting your family supplies, and in hauling aiid
cutting a good supjAy ot wood fGr your wife. '1 hope
she and her little ones are well."
"As hearty as bucks."
"Well, call at the store," (shops in the country are
invariably so called,) "as you go along, and Henry will
hand you a little package of* winter-comforts.' Ask'
Mary to accept it from me. There, no thanks, Paul.
I can never repay her for all she has done for me arid
for this youngster. By the way, he wants to go hoirie
with you."

"Of course he does, Uncle George. Let him go.
Bundle up, Lynde, and we'll be off. Where's your
coat and mittens? By the powers! I'd almost forgot
it, boy! Here's a pairs of* bran'-new mittens that
Mary's been knitting you~"
I ran, with boyish eagerness, for my capacious coat.
The omnipresent housekeeper met me at the door.
"What's to pay, Lyjade ?"
"I'm going home."
"Home? Why, you're. at home now."
"Well, to Paul Warren's, then."
And now commenced the process of bundling up--a
process which has a great deal of profanity to answer
for by.~and-by. I would rather have gone with merely
an additional coat. But no! Ann's kindliness now
labouringly and fermentingly found vent in the prepara-
tions for the ride. First, tho~ ear-pieces of my cap
were let down and tied under my chin. Then I donned
an overcoat big enough for Cardinal Wolsey, who,
everybody knows, was
"A man of unbounded stomach !"*
#'
Then a pair of yarn stockings, despite, my remon-
~j.    strances, were drawn over my boots; ~then a comforter
was tied, fold on fold, around my neck; and, over all,
the large-hearted Ann would fain have piled an old
camlet cloak; which had been visible from time whereof
the memory of man runnetli not to the contrary.
Against this last A~1tnean imposition, however, I suc-
cessfully rebelled. But, then, a bundle was to be pu~
up, ccmsisting of fruit, cakes, candy-what not ?-for
the children. Thus freighted and fortified, (against
the. cold,) despite an outpouring of injunctions touching

* One of the l~eartiest laughs I ever had or saw, was in reading

in their merry peal. Paul hummed the aii of one of
the raftsmen's songs. The cattle swayed their huge,
clumsy frames in an ungainly gait. The runners
grazed roughly and gratingly over the frozen hobs,
which were not yet beaten doww; while from the neigh-
bouring woods rang, sharply and merrily, some stout
woodman's axe. And, now and then, you might hear
a' hearty' laugh, or a distant ,shout, or the sharp ring
from the rifle of a hunter early astir, waking the woods,
leagues .around, with' echoes.
We halted at the store. Henry 'Towner, the. 9lerk,
handed to Paul a goodly package; and I took the op-

and sallied forth unwieldily towards the sled.
"Stay to breakfast, Paul," said my father..
"Thank you. I breakfasted two hours ago. IBut
this little shaver must have"-.
"No, I don't want ~any !" said I, eagerly.
"Well, then, off we: go. Good morning, Unole
George."
"Good morning, Paul. My love to* Mary and the
youngsters; and take good care of this boy, will you ?"
"Never fear for that !1~ said Paul, heartily; and,
with a loud, ringing "Whoa! haw, Buck ! back, Bright!
come along here, Ii say !" he set his cattle in motion
towards the mountains. I ceased to fret at the bun-
bling process which I had survived and when we were
out of sight from the house, I threw off the overcoat
and comforter; pulled the stockings from off my new
cow-hide boots, (of which I was as proud as my lord-
mayor of his new coach ;*) leaped from the huge lumber-
sled into the snow, and followed the merry woodman
beside his teani. The cold had no terrors for me; for
1 had been ridiculed into defying it.
We jogged onward but slowly in the yet untrodden
snow. The sleigh-bells were already heard in

The reader who is familiar with the geography of
North-eastern New York,---irny o.ne, indeed, who has
e~ver been on Lake Champlain,-~-.knows right well, that,
as you sail from Split Rock northward, you see the
Green Mountains on your right-Mansfield and Camel's
liuznp usually covered with snow; and, on the left, the
low, but many-shaped and picturesque mountains of
Essex., IBoylston, as every body knows, is situated on
the Bouquet-a small, but most beautiful river, whick
winds romantically among the inequalities of the hill-
country towards Lak~IJhamplain. The village is, per~
haps, a mile and a half from the mouth of the river;
and, in rowing to the lake, you pass between chores
overhung with the beautiful vegetation of the Northern
forests, decrying .new beauties in every furlong of the
way; here, a point studded with the dwarfish pines,
h~mloek, spruce, birch, or~4lr; there, a bay With ~its.
eddies and shadows, in which the fish are leaping above
the surface; and again, an islet where Blannerhasset
might have been content to dwell. One of ~these, by-
the-by, is the scene of a story of which I may some
day, give the reader the details. And then, as you
reach the mouth, the lake is before you. Oh! that I
could see it again!
I've roamed in lands of' southern suns,
Far over. the heaving main;
But fairer than the waters there
Is nioi~ntain-girt Champlain.
The prairie-turf has been my couch,
I've passed its seas of grain,*
But fairer far than they to me,
Is ioland-gemmed Champlain.
At solemn altars have I knelt,
In many-columr~ed Lane;
-     But nobler altars are the hills
That frown o'er blue Champlain.

The ashes of the hotiour dead,
At Freedom's altar slal
liest there in silence on the shore
Of glorious Champlain.
Red Battle's hoofs have trod its banks,

CHAPTER III.
THE WOODMAN'S HOME.
HE .wa~ right.' We had emerged from the woods
into a small "clearing," containing, perhaps, twenty
acres. In fierce and somewhat gloomy contrast with
the stainless, untrodden snow, rose, in grim stateliness,
the black, fire-charred pines, with countless stumps be-
tween them, over which they stood with a sentry.like
sternness that used to make my heart quake with un-
defluiiable terror. Some of them were branchless,
while. others. stretched. gropingly, with a blind man's
awkward aimlessness, into the' wintry 'space around
them', a~ if yearning; in their bereavement, foi' their
scioi~s ruthlessly cut down by the stalwart' reapers of'
Those grand, old woods."
This' clearing was on the 'right of the road. On the
left, the woods were~ yet untouched by the~ axe;' 'and
thus, .wi'th' the forest on one side, and the clearing on
the ether, we were approaching the house. This was
now plainly in sight.
~*On the brow of a recently cleared hillock, on which
the blackened stumps were still standing, was Charles
~Warren~ 1k was ~a fine, rosy..cheeked little~feflow, one
year' 4d~r than ni~y~elf; and he wap now waddling
stoittl~r,~'but clumsily, ~towards us, 'through the yet un-
i~te*i snow. He had~learned~ practically, the wisdom
of the Asses' Bridge; for, instead of keeping the high~
way, to gain' which he must have gone some two hun-
dred yards from the house, in a direction perpendicular
to the road, he 'took the hypotenuse of the right-
angled triangle, and was approaching us through 'the

fields. On he came, puffing like a grampus; his coni-
cal woollen cap leaning jauntily over, and bending low
under the weight of a huge yarn tassel. With a bois-.
terous shout, jhe mounted the~ rude fence, and 'leaped
from the 'topmost log (for. of logs was it built): into the"
snow.
"Well done, Charley! That's right, my.: boy!
Never be afraid of the snow! Here's Lynde. come to'
see you !"
Our 'greeting was right' hearty. We had been play-
fellows together,' over' hill and through valley 'and
woodland. He had, unlike myself, a very reten.tive.
memory; and it was stored with long-hoarded treasures.
of nursery lore. These he was ever ready to relate~ to
me, in a monotone which rings in my ears, as I wn~te;
and countless were the nights when he related, With
the patience and pi'olixity of the narratress of the Ara~.
bian Tales, stories of' witches, ghosts) goblins, fairies,
and giants, parts of which' I still imperfectly remember~
The ~house was~ now plainly in sight. It was of logs-
a single story, with small narrow windows. At each
end was a rude chimney of sticks, covered with plaster,
one of them whitewashed. In front of it. was a; large'
pile of green wood, with the day's supply cut into
sticks about a fathom in length. Some of these were
maple~~-the finest wood in the world to burn.-.and not
less than fifteen or twenty* inches in diameter. Near.
this wood-pile was an unfinished well.. To the left was.
a stabIe,~ with a capacious hay-loft. . The building was,
always called "The Hovel." Still' farther in the. ~am@~
direction wa~the barn. ' This, as well: as the Hovel, was~i
of logs; 'and' the 'roofs of the three buildings were
rough, veiny pine boards.
Turning abrt~~tly around the corner of th~~nee,~we~
were in full view' of the house. Old Troy~, who was
lounging about the yard, cooked 'his :ears gs'he caught
sight of us, ~n'd set out at the pq~ de a~q~ towards
the intrudera. I1~e did" 'n~ot stop until within~, a fathom
of the headÂ§ of our cattle, when it seemed', t~ oeeur. to

him that he might have mistaken the character of ~the
new-corners; and he therefore ~et both his fore..feet
down together, coming to an abrupt halt, with a half-
suppressed ugl&amp;! His quick eye caught that of his
master, and he commenced a series 61~ frolics around
the sled, eyeing each* of us in turn, wagging his tail
most' furiously, barking now and. then, and performing
divers antics not announced in any bill of canine the-
atricals. We interpreted~ them all (and he need never
have been at so much trouble) into a very emphatic
assurance that we were as welcome as the flowers in
May. He was a large, fin&amp;looking, shaggy Newfound-
land, and, I need. scarcely add, a great favourite.
As Paul brought the, team to a~ stand with a loud
"W~xoa!" Ruth's curly head emerged from the door,
and with a "Oh! oh! oh! oh! father's come back 1"
she bounded along, bare-headed, through the snow to
meet us. Tier shout attracted the. notice of. the other
youngsters; and forth, in no very military order, came
her three sisters, Mary,' Judith, and Jane. Little Paul
followed, and, in a moment more, Mary Warren ap~
peaked' at' the door. There was little noise in our
greetings. More than any household I have ever seen,
Paul Warren's was noted for 'its cheerful quiet. Not
that the children had been taught to sit erect and silent
in their several chairs; not that fear kept them still.
Nothing like it It was. the mother's silent and unseen,
but controlling tone of manner, which, by a kind of
mesmerism I cannot explain, gave character to the
whole. If I may venture to say what seems to me to
have been the secret of her influence, it was affection;'
and, 'with a pardonable alteration of a single word, I
might here use Talfourd's beautiful lines in his' descrip-
tion of Ion:'
'~ Love, the germ
~Of ~her mild uature, hath shed graces forth,
J~xpauiiug with its progress ; as the sto~'e

We were soon at the door.. It was a rude one, of
pine. The latch; was of wood, and a stout leather
string hung' outside, wherewithal to lift it. In one
corner of the door was a little trap-door, cut for the
sole benefit and behoof of a huge gray cat, and so con-
trived that puss had but to apply ~her head to it, and
enter or leave the house.
It was but a few minutes before I was rid of my
huge coat, my cap and mittens, and seated with the
children, just as near the mother's chair as it was pos-
sible for us to get. Would that you could have seen
her, thus surrounded by her children I She was, per-
haps, thirty-five ;~yet so hardly had she been nurtured,'~'*
in the clear air of the mountains, that you would have
said she could not be older ' than twenty-five o1six.
She was faultlessly formed, and 'her figure was admira-
bly developed into that 'style' of healthful beauty for
which Englishwomen are so remarkable. You would
notice, sooner and oftener than, any thing else, her
head. There waa a beauty of symmetry in its classic
outline, which you would have gazed upon. again and
again, wondering the while what it could be that s~
thrilled your pulses with the sense of beauty. And
then the 'large, love-speaking eyes, 'which no shade of
anger: ever dimmed, and which need never have falle~
for the thoughts of the heart which spoke in every
glance. Her long, dark-brown hair was combed back,~
as you see it in the pictures of 'the Madonna, (I never
saw one that~ equalled Mary Warren in that style~ of
matronly beauty~ which artists so 'much covet as a
model,) and~ gathered' in a kuot.~ Then she was always
so neatly and tastefully, though plainly clad. There
was harmony visible in her wholi nature.
'0 Mary Warren, my more 'than mother, God bless
you! How often, 'in the darker hours of my life, have
IL felt the' influences of your early teachings! How
often' have I felt that there must be truth in the
doctrine of a sensible intercoinmunion of the spirits ef
those who love one another, though. leagues apart.

Life has been dark to you, but you have done what you
could ; and the peace which passeth all understanding
awaits you at every fresh trial of your thorn-planted
way. God bless you!
Paul caine in and announced to us the unwelcome
news that he must-~be' off . to the woods to haul a supply
of firewood, as lie would be absent for several days of
the ensuing week.
I was once more at home. I felt that there' I was
loved in spite of ~wy faults-and they were many. I
do not doubt 14~at' my father, my brother, and my. sis-
ters also loved me; but (I shall have more to say of
4~hem presently) they were not what I believe it is usual
to call demonstrative. Why they were not so, it is not
for le to say. The fault may have boon wholly mine.
Certain~ it is, that P would sooner have given my~ last
crust or 'copper fQr Mary Warren than for any of my
kindred. I believe I could have died for her. AtT
hQme I was never caressed. There was no kiss, no.
embrace for me there. There was no care for my
tastes and whims. My toys were rudely kicked out of
the way, or hid, or thrown in the fire: My better flaw
tu'e was not appealed to. I was under the r4qime of
FORCE; and every fibre of my puny frame rebelled as
~'heartily as did Lucifer. They did not trust me; and
they are so kind as to assure me that I was the black-
est~. homeliest, worst-tempQred brat that ever lay in a
cradle!
Yes, I was once more at home. . The magic of that
mother's smile disarmed every feeling 'of stubbornness
and ill-temper. I was in a new atmosphere4 The old
story it is, in briefs. I loved and w~s Iove~d. Oh.! how
supremely happy was 1, as I looked around me for the
fa'~niliar objects of my :infant home.. There was the
~huge old fireplace, 'eight feet wide if it was one, and
almost as many feet high0 An iron-wood pole rai~
across it,. on whi~h were hung divers rude pot-hooks,
and~. a fragment of a log-chain. The hearth was of
.wide~ fiat. stones. ~Xhere were. two large stones that

served for andirons, (for. Paul Warren was poor;) and
above them were huge blazing logs, that kept the
house comfortably warm. In one corner of the room.
was a bed. Scattered here and there were a few rude
chairs; and in one corner of the hearth was a, bench
capable of seating two or three persons. In the oppo-
site corner of the apartment was a large cupboard.
Near this was a deal table, and over it was suspended
a small old-fashioned mirror. Near this hung. an
almanac. Overhead were hook~ and poles, on~ which
were hung. divers articles of dress. On one of them
were some strings of apples, hung there to dry; and on
another were bits of pumpkin already dry, and shri-
velled into grotesque shapes-the pleasant omens of fu-
ture feasts. Over the door, on two' wooden hooks, Was
an old-fashioned musket, with a bayonet and belt, pow~
der-horn and shot-pouch.' The cat was purring quietly'
in the corner; and near Mary Warren, where she 'could
reach it with 'her foot, was a capacious cradle, wherein
Susan, th~ baby, was asleep.
The lower part of the house was divided by a rude
deal partition into two apartments,' thus affording a
room for the family stores, and another for a lodging-
room. A ladder, in one corner, gave access to the
loft; and a trapAoor, with an iron ring in it, to the
cellar.
Occupying a moment in loolcingat the familiar ob-
jects, I bethought me of my pockets; and, puiling'~out
the secreted stores, I distributed them, with boyish de-
light, to the children around me~ That day was a
jubilee. How often, in the toils and' hardships of after
life, have 'I recalled the scene, and lived it over again
in the land of dreams! Forth into the snow we sal-
lied-Charles, little Paul, and myself,, reinforced by
Old Troy, who was that day pressed into the commis-
sary department, and did much transportation on a big
sled. Poor old Troy! He sleeps the last sleep. Short
and 'simple ate the annals of-dogs. Vale I "Ilium-

In 'the evening Paul came home. Hauling several
of the huge mapledogs into the house, and clearing
away the brands, coals, and. ashes from that part of the
hearth which was next the chimney-back, he imbedded
one in the cavity thus made. The coals and ashes were
throwback upon it; and on this he piled another and
another. Then he threw upon these the half-consumed
brands, with a goodly supply of smaller sticks of wood;
and, ere long, that little cabin blazed with the roaring
Â£re. ~We gathered around it. Going into a committee
of the whole, the children (myself among them) and
the dog commenced a series of operations which made
~ the roof ring with merriment, and which might have
thawed the crustiest bachelor heart in Christendom.
Mary Warren smiled happily upon us, as she restlessly
plied her knitting-needles, or touched, now~ and then,
the rocker of the cradle, while Paul's eyes twinkled
and flashed with fun as he watched our mad antics.
The hours sped. We retired to our beds; and then, in
glaring, panoramic distinctness, did Jack the Giant-
killer re-enact his doughty exploits. Charles was the
story-teller of the household. I ;lE~~Ui~Od from him all
the earlier exploits of the very remarkable slayer of
giants'; but somehow the monotonous tone of the stor~
got the better of me about the middle of Jack's history,
and my next conscious movements were at daybreak.
It is, " in contempt of ~question," owing to this last-
1~entioned fact, that I have, to this day, no definite
idea of the later exploits, sickness, and death, or dying
speech and confession, of that very blood-thirsty per-
sonage, Jack the Giant-killer. The loss to tradition
is irreparable.

RIGHT merrily did' 'I ~pass the Thanksgiving. Some
of the, relations of the Warrens visited them during th~
week-their parents among the number. I spent most
of my brief visit with. Charles, in playing lumbermen
in' miniature. .We owed much of our success to old
Troy, who worked patiently in 'hauling the sled. Wh~n
indoors, we amused ourselves, in the good old game of
"Foxy and Geese." Paul went to "The-Falls" on the
following Saturday, and I returned with. him. Kate
and Lucy,' my sisters, received me kindly. My aunt

thinking of scenes far distant. No doubt such was the
case; for my uncle Mark Lynde, they told me, was a
sailor some years before, and was shipwrecked on the
Isle of Shoals.
My. sister Lucy was thought pretty. She certainly
appeared so to me; for though she was not very pa-
tient with her wayward, brother, I loved her de~rly-as
well, almost, as I did my sister Kate. When animated,
~he was *hat is called a showy girl, ~ind she'was' quite
a favourite among the young men of~ the village. She
were her hair in curls, (it ~urIed most beautifully,) and,.
as it was dark, it threw 'hei~ somewhat strongly-marked
features finely into relief. Her complexion was fair.
Her blue eye. was a pleasant one, though 'not 'betoken-
iiig' any very great depth of feeling. It is more' ex-
pi~essive now; *her experience as a wife and mother
having given it' character and tone. All in all, she
was a well-tempered, fine-looking girl.
Kate was 'not at all like her. Sh&amp; ~had dark, very
dark hair and eyes. Both were* called' bk~ck. Her.
complexion was not~ nearly so fair as that '~of her elder
sister. Besides, she was frail as 'a lily. She was sen~
sitive, shy, reserved 'Her step' 'was noiseless-her
voice ,low and mnusioal-and her smile, though 'not fre-
querit,' was' a strangeiy~sweet Qne. when y~u had. once
provoked it. She was 'thought homely;' but to me~~-to
all, indee4,' who' knew~ her: 'well-~the thought of 'her
plainness never occurred. She could well afford to be
plain-homely, even; for 'her 'rni~d made you indiffer-

* I was getting on 'terms with Jessie; when m~ father
'ea'me in.

wa~ ha mP&amp;ne~; and, for the life of me, just so long as
that manner remained, just so long I felt :that I mw*t
lack ~he feeling towards him which gushed unbidden at
the glance of my' foster father and mother. I feared
my father most intensely. . ' '
Such was our greeting. Jessie ,and myself, as well
as my aunt, the 'housekeeper, and my sisters, 'became
very suddenly 'silent. When we did speak, it; was ifl

my father appealed to the wrong principle for his au-
thority. Luckily, as I thought, my 'brother (hi~this'

It was not long before we were seated, around. a
blazing fire at Allan Grayson's. He was the village
clergyman. Like most of the' inhabitan~~ of Boyleton;
he was ~poor. He had been what is called .a charity-
student. He had graduated with honour, and had' been
once comfortably settled at a little village, some few
miles from Boston. He 'married, soon afterward,. a
beautiful girl as poor as himself; and, being an inde~
pendent thinker, he formed and broached 'opinionS
* which some of "the most straitest" considered he~retb
cal. As a matter of course, he wds obliged to seek a
new home.. By the merest accident, in the world, he
met my father while on~ his way northward, and, catch-
ing some portion of his enthusiasm in the glowing ac-
count he gave 'of the new country,' Allan Grayson pro'~
posed to his wife to accompany the emigrant-party~'
To his delight,, she cheerfully acquiesced, 'and, in three
days afterward, they'turned their backs upon the pretty
village of W-.
To me he had always shown a great 'deal of kind.
ness. My -father's business habits had enabled him~ td
befriend the excellent clergyman and his wife-.and
this he was never Weary of doing. It was quite natifral
that a warm friendship should spring' up, as it' 'did, be-
tween the two families. Indeed, there was no place
where my father was so fond of going, especially 'if ~he
were glootny or perplexed, as to the Graysons'. Mrs.
Grayson was a remarkably still, quiet sort of woman-.
and my father loved- quiet.' But, though quiet, and
almost taciturn, she was not reserved. She had a
world of housewife tact in having one's chair in' the
right place; the favourite dish upon the tftble; the
exact proportions of Jamaica, and sugar, and egg~, aDd
nutmeg, and cream in the egg-nog. Clergymen 'drank
egg..nog in those days. She knew, toQhoW-t6 humour
my father's whim~-he 'was inclined to be dogmatic
flow and then-and, without knowing, why, 'he' #as
fully persuaded ~hat~such' another instarice--~f womaidy
perfection was never seen. Accordingly, he was sorely

disappointed if the clergyman and his wife did not re-
~ gularly eat their Sabbath-dinner at his house, and
spend at least one or two evenings in the week With my
sisters.
No marvel, then, that 'the good clergyman WaS kind
to me. Jessie was the only ohild; and he often said
that he would give the world if he had but a boy.
"Never mind, boy," he would' say, "~ou~ shall be my
son. I'll teach you Latin and Greek, and give you an
inkling of Bon~iycastle; and when you have got your
diploma, yoti shall have Jessie."
My sister Kate was a favourite with lije wife, and
thus the two families had formed, in the trials and pri-
vations of their~ forest home, an intimacy and friendship
which contributed very largely to* the happiness of
both.
At nine o'clock my father came for me. He was
glad, he said, to have an accuse to drop in and see
them all.
"I am glad you did, Uncle George." (He had
caught the universal appellation;) "Glad you did. I

rude homes of the foresters in beauty. It has always

or whether it be that I associate it with "the hill coun-

left its visible it~press upon the marble of the monu-

robe so purely spiritual, with smile' so gladdening in
all its soberness, and with steps so noiseless and
angel-like, as when I see them "beautiful upon tke

though not -sanctimonious; and his face was lit up by a

accompanied byMrs. Grayson and Jessie.
The kindly greetings over,. all entered the hQuse. As

"Hold on, Lynde! Hold ~n- for your LIFE, my b~y.!

'by the interference in his domestic management. "I
flatter myself, Paul, that I know how to manage my

my orders about going on the ice, and he shall' have
it!"
Paul made no reply; but I saw his bThck eye flash,
his face grow pale, and h~s nether lip gathered between
his teeth, in a 'way that betokened the strife of passion.
"Why don't you go, sir ?" said my father, in a voice
of thunder.

I looked 'at him in his anger. I grew strangely calm
and 'self-possessed, while I saw his herculean frame
quivering with passion.
"Won't you go, sir ?" said he, fiercely.
"No! I won't go !" said I, stoutly; and I caught
Paul Warren's hand, ~and clung to 'him for safety.
"You won't go? We'll' see, sir. You 8hctll go!

strength of three common men,) and aimed a' blow at
Paul Warren which might have felled an ox.
'His' arm was caught from behind by the gentlemen
who had left the table, and had silently witnessed the
scene iii the office.
"For shame, George' Weiss!" exclaimed the clergy-
man. "I'm: ashamed of you! Think! The Sabbath-

"Unhand me, gentlenien !" said ray father, in a low,
husky tone. They ~til1 held him.
"W~6n't you? Then there with you !" and he hurled
both to the floor.
I had seldom seen my father in a passion-never in
such a one as then mastered him. Whenever I had
thus seen him, I observed that the moment he had
struck a blow, or discovered that he had wounded the
feelings of his antagonist, he was disarmed and' ready
to beg forgiveness. It was so now. No sooner had he
thrown the two men to the floor, than the revulsion
took place, and, falling backward into a chair, he buried
his face in his hands, and wept.
"I~eave him to me,"' said Paul to Mr. Grayson and
the squire; and they left the office. Fearful was the
paroxysm of my father's grief. It was long before he'
could regain his self-command.
"Paul, my old friend, forgive in &amp;!" said he, as he
rose, at length, from his chair. "Lynde, my son,
come here."
I obeyed, and put my arms around his neck and
wept.
"Don't cry, my son," said he, gently. "You are a

'BCHOOL-DAYS.---JONAH WIGGLES.WOR~H.-EXPERIMENTS.
Trn~ naxt ~week I went to school. My. recollections
'of those days are' ~f mingled pleasure and 'pain-~of
ambition and hopeless serfdom-of the keenest delight
arid of utter disgust. I confess, however, that i think
the pictures" we' have, in' most of our modern 'por-
traitures of'schoolmasters, ar~ unfavourably overdrawn,,
I 'have read' not a few books' in which' it seemed to be

(and richly so) of all the chastisement I received. ~The
faults of teachers then were the faults of the day.
The rod was the great panacea. Children were sent
to school (as they often are now-a-days) to get them
out of the. way. That is to say, the teacher was paid
a beggarly pittance to do what the parents were too
lazy, or stupid, or weak, to do themselves-.--to govern
the child--to produce a hundred-fold, not only in 'the
good ground, but in the thorns, upon the rock, and
by the wayside. He was valued as the ass is valued-
for his capability of endurance of hardship and toil,
and his* (unthanked) fidelity beyond other animals. of
his class; and they who were never in good-humour at
home were those to whom a moment's irritability, pro-
voked by nastiness, 'stupidity, laziness, or mulish obsti-
nacy, was the unpardonable sin.
But to my story. Mr. Wigglesworth was the anti..
podes of all I had been expecting in the person of the
new schoolmaster. He was a short, squatty, and some-
what corpulent man, from Vermont. The wrinkles
about his eyes were eloquent of fun, and the more so
by contrast with his assumed gravity. His learning
was confined within exceedingly narrow limits. Not
so his vanity;~ but this last was so good~humoured a
feature in him, as to be very pardonable. ' He wore a
very wide-brimmed hat, underneath which he wore his
hair brushed up fiercely 'on end. He wore green spec-
tacles, too; and used a huge, queer-looking cane, with
a 'fox's head carved on the handle. I never 'saw him
save in one dress, winter or summer, the same being
about the rustiest, most antiquated and dilapidated
structure of'cloth and stitches which 'it has been my lot
to behold in this '"vale of tears." His trousers~ barely
reached the tops of a pail' of cow-hide boots, which
might have served as pontoons for the ferriage, of
ordnance, and which were only allowable in a new
country, with a sparse population, where land is not
sold by the square foot. They (the trousers) were of'
a rusty, brownish yellow. The "nap" was worn off

and a perceptible gloss pervaded the 'principal points
of exposure.
His coat was of light blue, with well-worn brass but-
tons, and of the cut yclept "swallow-tail," with a, collar
reaching up to the philoprogenitive organ of his .cra~-
nium. A white neckcloth, and a collar that seemed
to be doing outpost duty, as a supporter of his ears,
threw his round, . full-moon-like, rubicund visage into
full relief.
Some two or three. score of us 'were assembled when
he came. He walked directly to the desk, (it did ser-
vice as a pulpit on the Sabbath,) without the slightest
greeting. There arrived, he commenced operations by
taking a huge old-fashioned watch (whose weight was
'I'    little more than sufficient to prevent the massive chain
and superabundance of seals from hauling it out from
the fob) and hanging it on a nail.' His coat was simi-
larly disposed of; and when* he had brushed his hair
yet more stiffly on end, his keen, shrill, nose-twanged
tones rose high above the urcl~in-din, in the abrupt
order-
"There, naow! git yer seats, all on ye! I'm gem'
fur to read the rewis !"
He read them, and proceeded to read &amp; chapter from
the ]3ible. Then the classes were formed. It came
my turn to read.
F
"Who are yaou ?"
"My name's Jynde Weiss."
"Git aout! I never heerd such a name. What's
the first name, d'you say ?"
"Lynde."
"Wal, I trust you'll get yer cranium' . lined this
winter ?" and he looked up to see if anybody perceived
the pun. "Never heerd t'other name either, as I
knows on. Anyhow, it's a darned queer 'un. Hold
up yer head, and read aout-LoUD !"
I got through' the first day nicely; but the days
were few, during, that. long winter, in which I did not
somehow provoke his ire. "I declare tew man !" was

his favourite expletive when irritated, and no one called
it forth oftener than I. I learned easily, and therefore
deferred learning my tasks until the latest moment.
There was a row of urchins on the same seat with me,
and tired (oh! how tifed I used to get on those. Strait-
backed, deal benches!) of sitting so long, we would
either imitate the Irish in
"Fighting for conciliation,"
or else contrive to get into a general titter of laughter.
Once excited, my risible muscles were beyond my con-
trol, and I laughed even under the whip.
"I declare tew man !" said Mr. Wiggleswortb, (his
praenomen was Jonah, but he always wrote his name
J. Wigglesworth,) "them 'ere boys pester me tew death.
I sat,', there! yaoz&amp;! LYNDE! c'm 'ere to me
He would then ply his whip with praiseworthy vigour,
breathing, meanwhile, with an' asthmatic wheeze, until
his wrath 'was appeased. I grew careless of the rod
and his admonitions, and bethought me of some plan of
revenge. With two or three other urchins, equally the
victims of his occasional ire, (he'always tried persuasion
and ghostly counsel before resorting to the whip,) I
finally matured a plan, which I considered not only very
ingenious, but highly original. I was familiar' with the
plan of sticking pins in the bench on which he sat-of
putting a brick in his coat-pocket as it liung against
the wall, while his attention was absorbed by a "sum"----
of pinning papers to its skirt when it was on him-and
other similar plans of annoyance.' I now flattered
myself, however, that I had concocted a scheme which
would amuse the school and defy detection.
Accordingly I prepared, with the. assistance of ~
blacksmith, a thin piece of iron, with holes for nails, to
serve as a spring, and bent it perhaps an inch out of
the horizontal line. This I nailed beneath the' bench
where he usually ,sat. I then bored a very small hole,
through which I passed a large darning-needle, and


LThD1~ WEISS.

tied the needle to the spring by passing a stout thread
through the eye of the needle and around the spring.
To the same spring I tied a bit of small cord, and
passed it through a hole in the floor. I then went out-
~icle the school-house, an~ passed the string up through
~, l~ole izk the floor, (bored to let the water off when the
hon~se was scrubbed,) near my usual seat. There were
other similar holes in different parts of the house.
At length my plan was matured, and every thing
was in readiness. I never, shall forget the day and the
~cene. It was a dark, rainy, foggy, disagreeable morn-
ing, during the "January thaw." Jonah was mani-
festly in the doldrums. He came in with a very digni-
fled air and took his seat. He looked around with an.
ominous scowl that had wellnigh frightened me from
my purpose. I put on my demurest look, however,
and awaited my opportunity. It came. He opened
the Bible at a chapter in the Old Testament, and I re-
member that he had just read the words, "All flesh is
grass," in his deepest twang and most drawling tone,
when, s~tadente diabolo, I gave the string ~t most
vigorous pull, and let it go.
~" On 1" shouted, or rather roared, Mr. Wigglesworth
he dropped the Bible and sprang "high in air,"
after the manner of an Indian chief in a war-dance.
"On! Murder! dod ding it all tew dingnation! Who
done that 'ere ~"
The school now burst into one general roar of laugh-
ter, de profundis, loud, long, irrepressible. Jonah's
face crimsoned with rage as he looked beneath the
bench and saw the spring. His rage mastered his cau-
tion. lie pulled the string, as I expected he would,
through the hole, and, of course, lost all clue to the
.offender. The chapter w~s not finished that morning.
~Uhe story got abroad, and Jonah Wigglesworth de~
camped to the more congenial atmosphere of the Green
Mountains.
In reviewing the scenes of my school-days, IL look,
with a regret which I have no words to express, on the

folly, and worse than folly, of which I was guilty, in
thus adding to the cares and' perplexities of the most
harassing toil beneath the sun. I would that I could
recall them, or, if that be impossible, that -I could see
the men who were disposed to be kind to me, and
would have been so but for my waywardness and folly;
nay, who were kind to me, and patient with me, despite
my faults and misconduct. When I think of the toil
and care-the fault-finding of patrons whom nothing
can please-the hopelessness of fame or distinctiori'-~.-
the grudgingly-given, pitiful stipend of his toib-the
Want of all sympathy for, the teacher's trials, and a
thoii~nd other desagr.~1mens of the profession, (if I may
so d~nify it,) which experience has revealed to me, IL
may be pardoned, for saying that I so deeply regret
those errors and follies of m~r school-days.
As I ma.y not have occasion to refer to Mr. Wiggles~
worth agaixk3 may not b~ amiss to say ~tbM I saw him
a year or two since, during a trip from Burlington to the
Notch of the White Mountains, lie 'had married soon
after he left Boylston, and had a family office, chubby
children. I confessed md received absolution for xn~y
practical experiment on the elasticity of iron; and he
told the story, laughing till the, tears ran down his
cheeks, to his wife.

CHAPTER IX.
THE ACADEMY.-COMPANIONS.--'-LYNDE BECOMETH ATTENTIVE TO
MR. CLAYBANK.-LYND]~1' 5 IMPROVED SY5T~M OF 5MO~INO.
WE exchanged King Log for King Stork. The suc-
cessor~ of Jonah Wiggresworth was a genuine Tartar. I
received :a severe flogging the first day, and- something
like a score of my conipeers received a. similar earnest
of 'the policy of the new administration. I was pretty
thoroughly got into harness by his lynx-eyed vigilance
and uncompromising exactions. Months rolled away.
Years passed. Political excitement made its way even
to the quiet viU~ge of Boylsfon. The State was tossed
on the billows of faction in the mimic war of the Olin-
tonion's and Bucktails. My father took a warm interest
in politics, and 'was elected to the. Legislature, or As-
sembly, as the New Yorkers are wont to call it. Sub-
seqviently .hewas s~ent to Congress as a member of the
lower h6use, and gave, as. far as I can learn, very
general satisfaction to his constituents.'
In the meantime, I had left the district-school for the
academy,~ or perhaps F should. say boarding-school, as
the institution combined, more of the features of that
class of schools. The Reverend . Theophilus Winter
was my instructor. He was a most worthy man. He
was of exceedingly small stature-neat, precise, and of
a heart that overbalanced his head; for, ~like most stu-
dents, he was no financier9 Ii shall never forget 'the
careworn expression that met my eye when I first saw
him. The exercises of the school had already com-
menced. He was' surrounded by about forty pupils,
from the age of eight to twenty; and all were in a
small, low,, hot, unventilated room. Lie was initiating
a class into the mysteries of Fisk's Adams's Latin

Grammar. I stood sadly embartassed, while my Uncle
Hugh (who superintended my father's business while
he was absent) made the necessary arrangements. It
required all my firmness-and I could muster a deal of
it in an emergency-.~-.to prevent my eyes from telling
tales of me when my uncle left me amGng that throng
of strange faces. I found it impossible to' study. The
keen, piercing, yet kindly eye of the teacher met mine
occasionally, as I looked around on the group of faces;
and the furrows on his ample forehead, worn there by
the toil and cares of years, won for him my ready and
hearty sympathy. I became attached to him.
The first and most striking contrast I noticed be-
tween my old and n~w home was in the meagre fare-~
the apology for tea and coffee-the quantity of butter,
(greater than nothing by "no assignable difference,")..
and usually rancid, and the scanty allotment Qf other
palatable food. This, let me say at once, was not pro-.
perly chargeable to Mr. Winter, for his terms were so.~
very low, that to have furnished us good food, in proper
quantity and variety, Would have more than; exhausted
his scanty revenues.
I soon made acquaintances,. All my preyions siiffer.~,
ings under the rod had' not yet taught me seWgQv~rIi.~
ment, and my pranks began to attract the attention of
Mr. Winter. J was astounded on~ morning by an,
abrupt summons to. go forward to his desk.
"Was it you who put'. the asa~foetida on Mr. Clay.~
bank's (~he usher's) stove ?" said he, with ~some 8terfl-
ness.
"No, sir.
"I1~d you any thing to do in hidii~g his boots, this
morning? 7      :'          ',
"No, sir.
""L~o yowk~iow who: filed ';the 'sto~e-pipe.wj~l~, grass,
l~t sTbursd&amp;y ?'~,
"Yes, sir."
"Who wa~ it ?"
I made no reply..~.- ~.'

"Had ~ou any hand in it?"
"In the pipe, sir?"
"ANSWER me, sir! Did you assist in filling the'
pipe ?"
"IN'o, sir."
",IPerhaps somebody assisted yot&amp;. Was it so ?".
"Yes, sir."
"Well, Master I~ynde Weiss, permit me to say to
you, that I've heard of your pranks before, and that if
you do not alter your course, you will be' dismissed
from this institution."
This public reprimand was of some temporary ser~
vice. I was~ for a' time a model of hard study, and of
the profoundest and most respectful deference to beth
the' excellent clergyman and his somewhat unamiable
usher.
It was at this school that I became acquainted with
0eYeral boys ~ho were subsequently my classmates in
co1leg~. There were two with whom I was more espe~
~ially in1~imate. One of them was a son of Mr. David
Fogg'; of the firm of'Fogg &amp; Gibson,. with whom I was
already acquainted; the other, a son of~ a clergyman
settled in'a village some thirty-five miles from Boylston.
B~rney Fogg wa~ the'most studious of all the pupils at
th~ Allenville Academy. He was my antipodes in
almost every thing..
"Barney," I would say to him sometimes, "let's go
and have a skate on the' lake" (Allenville was on the
1ake~shore.)
"I can't."'
~"Why, B~rney ?"
"I've a Greek lesson to get," and without further
reply, he would mutter in a bee-hive, treadmill-like
monotone, "Thyto, t~pteis, tuptei I"
Oh, hang the~ Greek, Barney! LeV~s have a. skate.".
"* Yo~ can go if y6ii~ve a mind to~ ' Etupsa, etur
sas -
"Won't you go, Barney !"
"No! Tetupha, tetuphas, tet"-~

LYNDE WEIS$.                67
I did not usually wait beyond the declension of the
optative mood; and while I left him, vexed at hi~
dogged, indefatigable, humdrum devotions to the
Greek divinities, he was as unruffled as the surface of
his favourite lake among the mountains. Despite all
our diversity of habits and tastes, we were (as indeed
were Mr. Fogg and my father) fast friends. I had
come opportunely to hi8 assistance ~ne day, when two
large boys were endeavouring to beat him; and he bad,
on one occasion, pulled me, halfdrowned,. from a rift
in the ice.
Jar~ies Allen was a somewhat more congenial spirit.
We were chums and classmates. He was a small, thin,
frail, but very intellectual lad, whose moral and intel-
lectual nature had an undisputed sway over the animal.
With me, the two , principles were in almost ceaseless
warfare. I envied him his quietness and self~control.
They seemed inborn. On his part, he became very
warmly attached to me, in spite of my 'i4yward freaks
and uxiaccountable moods; and we built many a scom
of those airy chateaux which, by all' accounts, must
cover yery nearly the whole of the broad lands of Gas-
tile and Arragon. We kept journals. We walked and
rode together, and he used to go home with me at vaca~
tions. We were almost constantly together. His habits
of study, however, were of a cast far better~ than mine.
His lessons were learned uniformly well, and he studied
the prescribed number of hours. I, on the contrary,
studied intensely and with scarcely any exercise or re-,
laxation, (sometimes without regularly going to my
meals,) for days in succession, and then I did nothing
worth mentioning for a we&amp;k. He waxed pale and thin
with study and confinement, and was troubled with a
cough in winter time that gave his friends mitch un-
easines&amp;; while my active habits made me more robust.
The memory of my reprimand wore gradually away,
and my appetite for mischief returned. Several small
offences were insufficient to stake Mr. ~Winter's confi-
dence in my recenV reforinatiQn. Au accession of

pupils came in one morning, and I was billeted upon
Mr Olaybank. There were two beds in the room. The
usher was a very prim, fastidious sort of man. An
offensive smell, an unusual bustle, a mistake in a
lesson, a. soiled hand, or a rumpled collar, were his
litter abomination. Nervous, irritable, whimsical, he
was my favourite subject of experiment. Many a jere-
mniad did the chambermaid listen tQ, in consequence of
divers unsightly stains upon his pillow; constant re-
movals of his books (it fretted him to have a book or a.
pen, even his paper-cutter, removed) from the position
which it was his wish that they should occupy, and
other ~imila.r annoyances. Pins were found in his
sheets. His razor escaped, now and then, from the
ease. The chambermaid protested (as well she might)
her entire innocence.
"Is it me ye mane, Misther Claybat"-
"Mr. Olaybank-~--Claybank is my name, Margaret."
"Claybank ~thin, or Clayshank-it's the same to
nie-av ye lay the bla'gard t;b7icks to me!"
"Well, but who does them, if you don't ?"
"Och! botherashin! Don't be after accusing' a poor
lone woman as niver dhramed of doing the laste taste
in life o' mischief till anybody in the world."
And with the air of injured innocence she would
stalk out o~f the room with a swing "aiqual to the
queen." I suggested that the boy Tim, who made~ our
fires, might be die offender. Mr. Claybank called Tim
and questioned him. Tim lifted his hands in mute
astonishment.
"Did I lift the books, is it, Misther Claybank ?"
Yes, -Tim, that's the question I asked you. Here
are my ~books all bottom-side up. My pen ~s two
inches deep in the ink, and I am certain that I left the
inkstan&amp; corked; for. the ink evaporates so, and. gets
thick when it's exposed to. the air. Did you move my
books?"
"AV coorse I didn't, Misther Claybank. 1"-

"That will do, Tim; you may go.. Who can it be,
Lynde?"
"Sure enough," said I.
"Of course, Lynde, you wouldn't. annoy me in this
way?"
"ME, sir?"
"No, it couldn't be you. Forgive me! But, really,
this is too bad. There was a kind of powder on the
pillow-case last night that kept me sneezing till two
o'clock."
"What could it have been ?" said I, demurely.
"The Lord knows! There's a kind of snuff, I be~
lieve, which sometimes has that effect. And besides,
now I think of it, do you use tobacco, Lynde ?"
'1
"No, sir.
"So I supposed. But there has been a strong smell
of tobacco about the room to-day; and if there is a
thing I do detest more than any ether, it is that nasty
weed."
Mi'. Olaybank's olfactories did not deceive him.
Knowing his aversion to the weed, I. had bought a-.
pound of fine-cut tobacco, and sprinkled it plentifully
under the cloth that covered his table. He kept sniff-
ing at intervals, with every sign of extreme irritability.
"Don't you smell it, Lynde ?"
lTThat, sir?"
"Why, the nasty tobacco4~
"Yes, sir," said I, also sniffing, "I think I do smell
something like tobacco.
Mr. Claybank retired early that night, leaving the
window a little way open. Not content with what ii
had done, I now devised a new and more terrible an-.
noyance. The little table at which I sat in Mr. Clay-
bank's apartment was near the window. In one of the.
lower ~panes &amp; small liole~ had. been broken, which Mr~
Winter had been promising to repair, b~xt which he con-
stantly forget in 'the thousand other cares of the house
and school. The window was~ directly beneath a semi4~
circular window in the gable, and* in that also there

was a broken pane. The stove-funnel went through an
aperture in the ceiling considerably larger thaii the
funnel.
When Mr. Claybank had fallen into a sound sleep, I
cautiously opened my trunk and took out the " paper.
of tobacco. I then left 'the room, and ascended the
stairs to the attic. Taking a piece of board, I covered
it with tobacco, and raised it to so sharp an angle of
inclination, that a very' slight movement would be sufli-
cient to send a portion of the tobacco 'down through
the aperture in the ceiling directly upon the stove. I
then tied a thread to the board, passed it out of the
window in 'the gable, and, going to Mr. Claybank's
room, I hauled it in.
He had not 'been asleep more than an hour when he
woke with. a violent colic. My organ of benevolence
(phrenologically speaking)' was excited. I ran down
stairs *for the peppermint, and had 'the pleasure to dis-
cover that it gave him almost immediate relief.
"You're a goodhoy, Lynde," said Mr. Claybank. I
winced. "Yott were '~rather naughty, though, when
you first came here, and I'm. sure there's no one who
more sincerely rejoices 'to see the improvement in you
than I. I feel as if I could go to sleep again now.
Good night, Lynde."
"Good night, Mr. Claybank."
"A'n't you going to bed'?"
"Yes, sir; I'm on my last lesson now.
I blew out the light, and 'lengthening the string so
that I could take it into bed with me, I was preparing
to retire When Mr. Claybank startled me by saying,
rather abruptly,
"I say, Lynde, hadn't you better bury the fire in
the stove with the ashes? It's' confounded hot here.
Cover it up, Won't you, Lynde, there's a good boy ?"
Certainly, sir.":
I now got into bed, and cautiously pulled the string.
I lay cjuietly for ~ moment, awaiting the result, when

the poor usher begar~ a9 most vigorous and ira~ciJAe
sniffing.
"What is to' pay now? There must. be somebody
among the boys that smokes. If There's any: thing I
do 'hate, it's tob~,cco-sn~oke. And where on .e~rth' it
comes from is the ,question. Lynde!"
I did not answer.
"how quick these little fellpws drop asleep! Nic~
little fellow, that Lynde! I'm afraid I'm rather. hard~
on him sometimes. H~ff! H~ff! (sniffing.'). Well,. I
should desire to know-however, I mustn't get angry.
Stephen! (addressing himself,) you've resolved to keepr
your temper, you know, though it's provokingly KharcL
sometimes~ But where ~1oes this nasty smell ~o~m;e from?
Perhaps Mr. Winter is smoking his pipe. It's a terri-
ble habit in anybody-in a ~lergymau especially. I'll.
go down 'and see. Where in the woi~ld is my dressing~
gown? That stupid chambermaid eternally moves it
out of the place where I invariably hang it."
Mr. ~Jlaybank now went down stairs.. I got out of
bed, and broke the string '.nea~'~ the window. I then'-
blew the tobaeoo off the stove, 'and got into bed.
"WeW if this ~'n't strange 1" said the usher, on his
return. ~" The qu~er&amp;st thing I ~ver he~r&amp; of! I shall

* tobacco about the stove. It beats all creation. I do
believe I sha'n't 'get any sleep to-night."
With a chapter of such incoherent mutterings, Mr.
Claybank talked himself asleep, while I lay with the
corner of the pillow-case stuffed into my mouth, to pre-
vent myself from laughing outright. There was such
an air of serious, martyr-like patience, together with a

puzzled expression, quite a~ comic, on the face of~ the
poor usher, as he stood, candle in hand, trying to fathom
the mystery, that I was delightfully relieved when I
heard his fil'st) low snore.
I had intended .to rise early in the morning, and r~-
move all traces of the experiment. Unfortunately,
however, I slept late. Margaret had occasion to visit
the attic in her matutinal round of duties. She dis-
covered the board, and the tobacco, and the string;
and lookhig out at the window in the gable, saw it
reaching precisely to the hole in my window. The
truth flashed vividly upon her mind. The usher was
informed of the discovery.
About nine o'clock that morning I was summoned t~p
Mr~ Winter's study, and politely requested to "pack
up my things," As Tim ~ould be ready at half-past
nine to drive me ~ Boylston. And thus ingloriously
did I quit the academic shades of the 'AIIenVille Aca-
demy.
"Good-by, Lynde," said Barney Fogg. "Served
you right! I always told' you so."*
James Allen came to the sleigh and shook my hand.

LYNDE REFORMS,-00E5 TO COLLEGE.--THE HANDKERCHIEF.
WHEN I got home, my uncle Hugh talked with me
very seriously about my dismissal from school, and
gave me a great deal of good advice.
"These are golden hours, Lynde, as you will see by~
and-by, though you may. not see it now. You are
getting too old for these things, now; and I am sincerely
sorry that this has occurred. The session is already

"That's a fine fellow! I'll try to e~p1airi matters to

at Milton. Will you do me the favour to carry this
note t~ Mr. Grayson ?"
"Certainly, uncle, with pleasure;" and~ 1' left the
room. I heard him, as I passed the windows of the
sitting-room; roaring with laughter; and I shrewdly
guessed the cause of it.
~y father ~rrived. the ~iext day. As I" expected, he
lecturee" me with ~much severity,. and threatened me
with a flogging 'if he should ever again hear~ of any
similar pranks. I spent a day at Paul Warren's ;... aud
in a day or two afterward, I was placed under. the care
of Chester Phillips, A. M., in the pretty village of MU-
ton. I remembered my promise to my uncle, and kept
it. Dear, good Qld man!. how I loved, him! He was
a man .of giant stature almost, but of admirable prow.
portions. He was a benevolent, large-hearted ~old gen~
tleman, full~ of good-hwxmour, and possessing, with an
inexhaustible fund of anecdotes, the very bigheei~ skill


64                LYND~ WEI$~.
and tact as a narrator. Simple he was as achuld;
and we all loved him. He had the rare power of adapt-
in g his manner to the tastes and humours of those with
whom he associated. He was as dear to the light-
hearted, gay, frol~cseme Lucy, as to her graver, and
more thQughtfui sister. No one could so convulse, my
father with long, loud, boisterous laughter; and while
the housekeeper declared he was a "fusty old fellow,"
she would suffer nobody to take the charge of his room,
or his wardrobe, except under ~her direct supervision.
He had a way, too~, of teasing my aunt Caroline about
some love-affairs of her younger days, that rendered
him quite as much a favourite with her.
I studied hard at Milton. I remained there two
years; and not once did I receive a 'harsh word or 'an
unkind look. With what pride did II 'give to my father
Mr. Phillips's letter of warm commendation, 'in which he.
announced that Ii was now prepared to present myself
for examination, preparatory to entering college! I
returned home in' time to spend 'my seventeenth birth-
day. By invitation, Paul Warren, his wife and chil-
dren, and the good clergyman, with Mrs. Grayson~ and
Jessie, spent the day with us. I was now well-grown;
perhaps somewhat overgrown for my age; and Mary
Warren flattered me not a little by saying,
"I'm proud of you,' Jaynde. You're getting to be a
man, almost. ,Will you forget your mother Warren,
when you comes back' from college a learned man
"~Forget you, mother ?" exclaimed I~ (I do n6t know
that ii had ever called her so' before,) "'No, not while I
live.. You have 'been more than a mother to me, if that
is possible; and may God bless you for all your kindi~
ness.
She turned her head hastily away and walked to the
window, as I spoke with more than my 'usuaL earnest-
ness; and I saw her lift her.handkol~chief to her eyes.
Jessie, for some' reason or other, seemed constrained
and reserved.' What~could it ~~mean'?' I felt half vexed ~
for among 'the brightest of the visions of' h&amp;ii~e,~ di~ring

my absence, was the long-wishedfor 'meeting with her.
And now that I, had returned, not a little proud of the
honours I had won at the academy, she was the only
one whose face did not respond to the general emotion
of pleasure. ' She hung~ her head, too; bashfully,
almost; and I had always known her to be remarkably
frank, easy, and self-possessed. I iwas. puzzled. More
than that, I was annoyed. I assumed a dignified air;
and when Mr. Grayson sand his lady left us, I suffered
Jessie to go home without other attendance.
FrQm being vexed with her, I now grew vexed with
myself." I had never before suffered her to' go home
from my~father's house without going with her. Then
I tried to laugh at myself, and asked myself aloud,
"What if she is vexed? What is Jessie' Grayson to
you? Besides, didn't you see' her riding with Frank
Gibson, yesterday? llumph I"
I took my gun, and, calling Munch, who stood eyein~'
me and wagging his tail during my brief soliloquy,
strode away to the woods.
I love the woods. Well saith Bryant,
"To him who, in the love of nature, holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language."
Even so. I spent the earliest years of my life in the
woods. I have sought their still recesses in the h~ur
of joy;' and the grim old oaks' and pines seemed to me
to' be conscious of my ii~puJses.. Their leaves Seemed
to rustle more gleefully in the breeze as I looked aloft
through their giant branches. I have gone there in
sadness; and in the quietness of the scene, Qnly. broken
by the low wail of the wind 'through the tops of the
waving pines, peace ~arjne to my troubled spirit.~ I have
made me. a couch in the woods; of their evergreen
boughs; and while I sank travel-worn, penniless, weary,
and ahungered upon the rude bed, I felt a sense of
shelter ~nd companionship.' I have gone there in the
dark. hours of life; when the blackness of darkness

hung over my pathway, and affliction, bereavement,
agony, despair almost, crushed my spirit to the dust;
stealing away from'
-"The throng, to haunts untrod,
To hold communion there with God ;"
and the calm of the forest fell upon me. I tro4 its
aisles with uncovered head, in humble reverence. I
was not alone. There was 'around me* a Presence, like
that which passed before the face of the' patriarch,. "in
thoughts from visions of the night ~" and the storm
was hushed; the billows sunk to rest; the day-star of
hope twinkled above the hills; and there dawned upon
the tempest~strained spirit the light of peace.
I did not shoot any thing that afternoon. It hap-
pened, somehow, that I wandered in the direction of
Mr. Grayson's, instead of~ returning directly home.
Directly in the' rear of his house, and but a 'few rods
distant, was a hill which was generally called "The
Ledge." It extended nearly, or quite, a furlong along
the eastern bank of the Bouquet, and from its summit
you could see the entire village. As I emerged from
the wood8, the gleam of a white dress caught my eye,
and a few steps brought me in full view 'of the wearer.
I was within a very few yards of her before she saw

"How you frightened me, Lynde I" said Jessie, for

"Forgive me, Jessie! You were so distant at our
'house, that I was alrnost vexed with you. Mu IL for-

"Here she is now-the runaway I" exclaimed Mr.
Grayson, as he came around a clump of pines, in full
view of us. "Ali! J~ynde, my boy! you're just in
time, (and so are ~,'ou, thought I;) come and .take tea

plies to Mrs. Grayson and her daughter.

'C9LLEo13~ days! How mighty a throng of pleasant
memories rise up, waxing distinct and palpable, from
the mistiness of years gone by, like the genii of the
Arabian ights' Entertainments; summoned sturdily
forth by the despotic spell of lamp, or ring, or incanta-

Saxon Hotel. I had inquired of one of the passengers
in the stage-coach, the day before, for the best hotel

an old acquaintance:
"Barney Fogg, Boylston. No. 88, T."
So, Barney is going toKenter college, thought I. lie
had been talking about preparing tq~ ~enter~ the sophQ-
more class, and when I left' home it 'was under the im.-
pressioii that he would remain another year with Mr.
Winter.
Having ascertained, to my entire satisfaetio ~i, where
I was, I proceeded to dress. This, I have sin ~e ~arn-

in the estimation of the chamber-maids and porters as
to rise before ~six o'clock when days are at the longest.
The Brummel-like coloured-boy; who had taken off'his

I was a little vexed 'to see the boy, negro4ike; at-

I've had. You didn't expect to see me here, eh? I

written to you, but you didn't answer my last' three
letters. Took it rather unkind of you. Not exactly

"I believe I must ask you. to excuse. me, Barney. I

"Wal, I'll go with you, in half a minute. Do you

"I'm in a hurry, Barney, and"-
"Well, I'm all, ready 'but this plague boot. There!
that's on, I      Now I'm ~ready."
We.(for I couldn't get rid of Barney) walked for an
hour about the streets of Clinton. We went to the
college-buildings..' There was, here and there, an open
window, with the head of some inatutinal student just
visible.' With what awe did 1 gage on the walls of the
edifice-the features of ~my future Alma Mater. To
my inexperienced eye they were not very promising-
a plain physiognomy, whose hard brickba1~d~mortar ex-
pression would puzzle wiser disciples of Lavater th~rn I.
The' very trees that stood, sentry-like1 in front of it,

something awe-inspiring in the very stillness that
reigned' around. A pale, emaciated student passed. us
witho huge 'book under his arm. He was apparently
unconscious; of our presence, and, as if a spirit had

THOMAS BROWN.-.THE WARNING.
I STUDIJIID hard the first year. As I advanced, I
found my mathematical studies growing difficult and
irksome. Our professor of mathematics was reputed a
profound scholar-~justly so, I have no doubt. lie had
not, however, (meipso judice,) the art of explaining
well. I went to him one day for assistance, lie took
the book, (Calculus, or Conic Sections,) and looking
for a moment at the page, began straitway a harangue.
of some ten~ minutes' duration, in which a tornado of
technicalities poured restlessly forth for. my admiring
ears. Choctaw, Patagonian, Nukahivan, i~eejee, hea.,
then Greek was it all to me~
"You understand it all now, don't you, Weiss ?"
"Not quite, sir!"
"Huzuph!."
lie began again. Shades of the patriarchs a~d
prophets! what a second Nile-like overflow!
"Now you see it, don't you,, Weiss ?."

"Yes, sir, perfectly," said I, and left the recitation-
room ii~ utter fog, mystification, confusion, irritation-
disgust.
I grew heedless. I was reprimanded.
"Weiss, haven't you got this lesson ?" was the re-
gular query, and "No, sir," was quite as uniformly
the reply.
"What's an ellipse ?" said he, one day, after pro-
pounding several' other questions.
"An ellipse, sir?"
"Yes, ~in ellipse."'
"Why, sir," I replied, scarcely thinking what I said,
the most important feature, appears to me that it is
very much like a goose-egg; and that whereas circles
have but one centre, ellipses have two !"
A roar of laughter was the reward of my effQrt at
mathematical definition.
'In the classics I was more successful. Ii thought
Livy a bi~re, but I was delighted with Horace; and,
when we. began the Greek drama, a new world was
opened to~ me, on the accessible treasures of which I
looked much as I fancy Ali Baba must have gazed
upon the 'up-piled treasures of the Forty Thieves.
With all my study, however, James Allen and Barney
Fogg distanced me-the one by his genius, (he was a
fine classical scholar,) the other by his indomitable
habits of study. I was less studious than either. I
began to write verses, and to send them, under ficti-
tious signatures, to the newspapers. I was fond of
correspondence, and wrote a great many letters. Be-
sides, aS at the academy, I studied hard, or not at all,
as the humour 'seized me. I roved over the hills and
through the woods. I ransavked the college-library
for the oldest 'and mustiest books. ' Old Burton and
Sir Thomas Brown's Vulgar Errors were prime favour-
ites. r waxed humorous in my' style, and the smile
which my productions provoked, repaid me for the
lowering looks of the conclave of the powers-the
college council.

LYND2E WEISS.
At the beginning of th~ winter-vacation I went
home. Much to my surprise, the committee of a
neighboring school-district offered me the post of
teacher in their school, and without so much as a visit
to Paul Warren's, or an hour's chat with Jessie, I hur~
ned away. After. a most critical examination, in which
I was questioned in the occult mysteries of Daboll
and J~indley Murray, from the number and sounds of
the letters to the grammatical arcana of Thomson's
Seasons, and.~ the equally profound secrets of* cube
roots and the rule of three, I received a certificate,
which assured all whom it might concern, that Mr.
Lynde Weiss had been duly examined, according to
the statute in such cases 'made and.provided, and was,
in the opinion of the committee, qualified to teach the
school in District No. '- for the space of one year.
They were excellent people, those plain moun-
taineers, and I was happy among them. All called
me "Master," without any intention of violating the
injunction of the New Testament. I had pupils much
larger and older than myself. I was consulted on all
knotty questions in law, politics, the sciences, religion,
and my decision was much of' the same weight with
them as was the reply of Counseller 5-., who used
to say to the presiding judge, when he quoted the
.Aicta of his predecessor, "I am older, sir, than that
decision.
A bitterly cold winter was that. But there were
roaring fires-merry hearts and good cheer-moonlight
sleigh-rides, and witchery more potent and dangerous
than the very innocent bells were chargeable withal.
I returned to college. Months rolled away, and I
was weilnigh through the sophomore year. The cue-
tomary. "exhibition" came on. I Wrote my oration
with care. I remember but little about it save that
there were some very crude notions in it on the subject
of eloquence. It bad (as did all my productions) a
spice of humour, and was very tolerably written.
The 'day came, With trembling knees and a quiver-


76                LYNDE WEI~5.
ing voice I ascended the platform. The chapel (for in
the chapel was the exhibition) was thronged. As. I
begaii' my oration it~ low and trembling accents, I hap..
pened to look towards the throng of faces near the
door, and caught the glance of Jessie Grayson. Away
went all timidity ; and with a flashing eye, 'my head
erect, my heart swelling and throbbing with an excite-
nierit, that would have made "a forlorn hope" the post
I could most covet, I went through the allotted task.
There were hearty congratulations for me on all hands,
and I now trod the streets with a prouder step. I be-
gan to comprehend the tendency and the natural results
of study. I grew ambitious. I began to pay particular
attention' to the study of rhetoric-Jamieson being
favourite author. I took unwearied pains in
writing, using as few words as possible of Greek or
Latin derivation, and substituting, whenever it was
practicalAe, the simple Saxon English.*
At the close of my second year, I went home to
spend. the vacation, lit was late at night wheil I ar-
rived. Munch soon exchanged 'his furious bark or the
most extravagant caresses. The family, with the ex-
ception of my uncle Hugh, had retired. The uproar
which Munch atA the. stage-coach contrived to make
in concert, brought him to the door.
The same heartiness which had always distinguished
him, gave tenfold value to his greeting.
"Welcome home, Lynde 1" said he. "I am glad
you happened to be' lat&amp; in your arrival, for I have
much to say to you."
"How are you all ?"
"Well; as are Jessie and the Warrens I have
something to say to you," said he, wheri~ we were
seated, "about your father and his affairs.
"Nothing wrong about him ?"
"We shall see. - In the first place, what I say is ~for

your ear alone. Your father is seriously embarrassed,
and I grieve to say that I am somewhat at fault in the
matter. I urged him, about a year ago, to extend his
business~ lie has. done so. Now, in any ordinary
times, he could soon pay' every dollar to his creditors
without difficulty. The times, however, are unusually

This, however, if it occur at all, will' not happen sooner

self, too, to the thought of self-dependence. If we can
avert the blow, well and good. If not, you would be

good-night. IBe cheerful, for your father is not in the

"Good-night, uncle."
It was long ere I slept. I tried to picture to myself
the probable results of such a misfortune. How would
my father bear the blow? and my aunt and sisters?
My father was ~sure of a competence for his family.
My brother could make his way in the world, and such
a woman as Ann West would never come to want.
What should I do ? What should I say to Jessie
Grayson? These, and a thousand similar thoughts,
kept me awake until nearly daybreak.
When we met at breakfast, however, I believe I was
successful in the attempt to appear cheerful and uncon~
cerned. I resolved that I would see as little of Jessie
as possible. So far as I knew, the attentions of Frank
Gibson were not unwelcome. If they were not, and if
he were a favoured suitor, I should thus 'spare myself
and her the pain of a rejection; while, (and "my heart
leaped at the thought,) if she loved me, the year that was,

probably, to decide my father's fate, would not place
me ma less favourable position. To carry out my in~
mentions, .therefore,'I went, that very day, to see my
foster-parents. I passed three days with them. Charles
had grdwn to a fine manly-looking fellow. Paul was
scarcely less changed. BAith had grown, too, almost
out of my remembrance. Mary, whom I remembered
as plain, and almost homely, bad become one of the
loveliest girls in Boylston. I could now trace in her a
very strong likeness to the mother. There was a love-
liness' about the mother which is seldom seen, and as
seldom mentioned, because it exerts a power which is
difficult tQ be analyzed. It was the loveliness of pro.
portion-karmony'in moral and physical character.
She had a fine head, to look upon which gave you a
sensation of indescribable pleasure; and the luxuriant
braids of her golden hair-her exquisite proportions-
her fine,* eloquent blue eyes-and, above all, her smile,
which was the light of Paul Warren's home, made her
one of the liveliestt women ii have ever seen. Joined
to such qualities, conceive the patience, self-sacrifice,
affection which characterize the sex, and you will not
wonder, worthy reader, that I loved her.
Mary had, as I have said, grown into a strong re-
semblance to her mother. The younger sisters were
yet small, though they, also, had' changed very much.
On my return home I found Captain Gayger with
my father, in the office. He' was standing, hat in
Ja&amp;nd, a1s if ready for his departure.
"Where are you bound, Captain Gayger ?" I asked6
"To Whitehall."
"Would you like to have a passenger ?"
"Yourself?"
"Yes."
With pleasure; but you must be aboard in an
hour:'
"Yery good."
And. he left the. office. In an liQur I had every

thing in z'eadiness. I put Dash to his 8peed, and was
just in time to get oA board6
"Cast off that bow-fast !" shouted the skipper, and,
keeping fast~ the stern4ine, he cast "The Empress" to
starboard. . In five minutes tnore we were under way
with a fine breeze on our larboard quarter.
My heart smote me, ae .we lust sight; of the landing,
that I had been so precipitate. I had. not seen Jessie
at all. What would she think of me ~ Had I not used
iher ill? I was thinking about asking Captain Gayger
to set me ashore, when he came up to me, and, . with* a
slap on my shoulder which was none of the gentlest,
said,
"Belay all that studying' , (thinking,) Jiynde! I'll
put you on a triangle, and set you to scraping' the
masts. Cheer up; jnan! Never get into the doldrun~s
unless you're becalmed."
And. he began, in tones that waked the echoes along
the wood-covered banks of the Bouquet, j' The Bay of
Biscay."
"As she lay,

roared his crew; and, not to burden them with my own
difficulties, I joined them in the chorus. With a fine
breeze from the north-west we soon reached the lake,
and, running well out to give the bar a berth, we bQre
away towards our port of destination. We had a Long
passage. What with calms, and some difficulty about
our freight, ten days had elapsed ere we arrived *at
]3oylston. On the evening of my return there was a
large party assembled at Mr. Gibson's, and among the
guests were the Graysons. Frank' Gtbson was most
pointed in his attentions to Jessie, and it so happened
that I saw but little of her6 The next day my father
requested me to go to a neighbourin~ county to ar-

days, and when I returned, there were but four days
of the vacation at my disposal.
I could defer it no longer. I must and would see
Jessie, I said to myself, be the consecjuences what they
might. I called at Mrs. Grayson's in the evening, and,
much to my surprise, Jessie was absent. To my in-
quiries Mrs. Grayson replied-amd somewhat coolly, I
thought-that she had gone to a neighboring village,
and would be absen1~ several days... I left them at an
early hour.
With a heavy heart did I return home. Parrying,
as well as I could, the remarks about my evident de-
pression, I spent three of the remaining holidays in
hunting and fishing. On the fourth I took my gun,
as usual, and, calling Munch, I set out for the moun-
tains.* I met with little success. Going by Paul War-
ren' s on my return, I bade them good-by. It was near
sunset when I reai~hed home, and, as I entered the
house, the first object that caught my eye was Jessie
Grayson, seated in my father's arm-chair. Never had
she appeared so lovely. I shook hands with her, and
muttered some incoherent, blundering apology for
having been so unneighbourly. I know not what I
said, and she seemed as much embarrassed as myself.
She took leave of my sisters at an ~'arly hour,.~ and I
accompanied her home.
It. was ~a beautiful evening in the latter part of
August. The river was glistening in the moonlight,
and t~ie tall old elms along its banks threw their huge
shadows upon the road. We said little on the way;
* but when we reached, the little wicket, beneath a huge
elm that overshadowed the parsonage, I pointed to the
river, the surface of which was broken into countless
glistening ripples by. the cool west wind, and we stop-
*   ped. The scene recalled many a pleasant'recollection
of my boyhood, and we spoke of the past.
"Jessie I" said 1, at length, and I took her hand in
mine. It was withdrawn, and she made no reply.

V

"Jessie !" said I, again, "you have thought hardly
of me. You"-
"It is late, Mr. Weiss. I must bid you good-night--.
a good-by, indeed, as you tell me you are going away
in the morning. I wish you
"Jessie, hear me! If you knew all-if you, knew
"Hu~h! There's some one coming."
"Good evening, Miss Grayson," said the flew-comer~
"Hello, Lynde! how are you, old fellow? Thought it
was Frank. Fine evening, Miss Grayson."
"Very, sir."
"Evenings alwa$18 fine this time o' year. Going
back to-mQrrow, laynde? Of course you will, though.,
Coach goes at four. You'll have to be up an' doin',
bright an' early. No names booked but ours. Have
all the inside to ourselves. How's all the folks, Miss
Grayson ?"
"Quite well, I'm obliged to you."
"Glad to hear it. Heard your mother was poorly.
Just left Frank. Says he'll have the buggy and bays
a
your door in the morning, for the promised drive to
High Bridge. By Jove! it~s eleven o'clock! Going
home, Lynde? I've something to say to you."
And thus was I obliged to say a simple good~night,
~ed off by the button by-Mr. Barney Yogg! The
"something to say" was a request from Frank Gibson
that I would write some verses for him, as he wished to
give them .to Jessie Grayson!

CHAPTER XIII.
LY~DE IS IN LOYE-"AND TROUBLE.-THE JOURNEY.-LYNDE SEEK~
ETH .EMPLOYMENT.~HIS PURSE IN TIlE LAST ~STAGES OF DECLINE
AND FALL..
I RETURNED to college. The journey was not parti~
cularly agreeable, for I was suffering with headache
and Barney Fogg all the way. I recommended my
studies; but ever, as I opened a book, there came the
features of Jessie IGrayson. 'Her voice, too, rang in
my ears-not in the gentle, musical tones of other
days, but in the cold sounds of our parting: "It is
late, Mr. Weiss." Most. truly could I say,
"Thou ~ hast metamorphosed me;
- Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
War with good counsel, set the world at naught;
Made wit with musing weak; heart, sick with thought."
Months passed. The customary exhibition of the
junior class, was drawing' near, and I had already
written my oration, when. I received the following let-
ter from my uncle :-
"BOYLSTON, July 9th, 18-~--.
"My DEAR liNDE :-It .is as I feared. Messrs.
Buckley &amp; North have foreclosed the mortgage. Your
father has lost heavily on the last shipment of lumber,
and there' is no longer any hope. Bear it, my dear
Lynde, as well as you can. I know not what to advise
you. Come home, and we will see what can be done.
"Your affectiQnate uncle,

was always impulsive. Without giving myself
for thought-stifling every suggestion of the pro.

bable consequences of the *step-l sold books, furni~
ture, a part of my wardrobe even, and, at sunset, I was
ready for my. departure. The president very kindly
gave me a letter of introduction to a friend of his in
Washington, and at nine o'clock that evening I was on
my way to the South.
It was late the next morning when I reached White-.
hall. I followed the throng of passengers, and jumped
upon the deck of the nearest packet. As the horses
started, the rain began to fall in that regular drizzle
that promises a long periodiof rainy weather. I went
below. Such a throng of passengers! Now that they
had all left the deck, and collected in the cabin, there
was scarcely room to contain them. The windows were
closed to keep out the rains The lamps were lighted,
and they filled the cabin with the senseintoxicating
odour of fish~oil. The atmosphere became almost in~
supportable. Some of the passengers were smoking.
Some of the ladies were sea~sick. The helmsman was
cursing, on deck, about some shortcomings of the
driver; and some of the passengers were grumbling at
"the miserable tub of a packet." Oh! the miseries of
that long night!~ Unable to endure the oppressive air
of the unventilated cabin, I went on deck, and seating
myself on the baggage, I sat, drenched with rain,
chilled, uncomfortable to the last degree, and heeding,
at short intervals, the helmsman's gruff wartilng of,
"Heads! Bridge !"
I awaited the dawn. I thought it would never come.
It came, however, and it heralded &amp; brighter day. We
reached Troy at nightfall.
As the day dawned on the following morning., I
reached New York. I slept until late. ; and when I
entered Broadway the living tide was upon its pave-K
ments. Oh ! what a sensation of loneliness and ,soli'
tude did I feel in the midst &amp;f that mighty throng~!
~{ever have I felt so strongly the utter insignificance of
a single human heart, as I did on th~t' memorable.
morning. On, on, restlessly poured the human tide;

and. the eye sought in vain for the kindly glance of
friend, kindred, or acquaintance. It is undeniable that
fhere is far less hearty social feeling in the city tfian
in the country. The stern necessity which sits glaring
upon the thousands of congregated poor-the grim
skeleton of Want, that makes one at the poor man's
feast~-the struggle for bread, for bfe,-these freeze
the better sympathies, just as they are blunted and de-
stroyed in the open boat, leagues away at sea, where
hunger absorbs all other sensations. Pray to Heaven,
good reader, that you may never meet want in a city.
As I was going down the Delaware, I met, on board
the steamer, a gentleman whom I remembered as an
old friend of my father's. In our conversation he
mentioned that he was going to Washington. The in-
cident decided my course, and I travelled in company.
with him.
It was late in, the evening, owing to a detention of
the cars, when I reached Washington. We were not
long in finding quarters at Mrs. Van C-'s, on
street. The next morning I called upon the gentleman
to whom my letter was addressed, (a lawyer, and for-
merly a classmate of the president of Clinton College,)
and having presented it, made some inquiries about the
chances for employment.
"You have not selected the best place in the world,"
said ,the~. lawyer, in a kindly tone,. removing his specta-
cles, and holding Vhem in his hand; "there are a great
many hungry mouths to feed in a city, and the capital
abounds. in them. There is a. school 'at Bladensburg
now vacant, and perhaps you can find employment
there." a' letter from him to the trustees, I walked to
Bladensburg-to be disappointed. Unaccustomed to
walking, I was sadly exhausted when I returned to the
city, and retired supperless to bed. Mr. K-, my
considerate and gentleman-like fellow-traveller, came
to my chamber to learn whether ]i~ were sick. I very
frankly told him of my 'plans-.--the history of my some-

I

what Quixotic journey-the horrors of a purse in ex-
tremis-and the failure, thus far, of my efforts to fijid
employment. With a kindness which I can never. for-
get, he at once began to make inquiries in my behalf.
Alas! he, too, met with no success. What should I
do? There were others at Mrs. Van C-.-'s looking
for employment. One was ~an applicant for an ap-
pointment in the army. Another was in search of' a
clerkship in one of the departments. A third was 'in
search of another office. But they were not' penniless.
They had friends to aid them.
To my inexperienced eye there seemed no possible
avenue ~f escape. 1 thought .of the West. Could I
not "work" my way thither? As a drowning man
clutches a straw, so did I at the thought of the mo-
ment. I had money' enough to discharge my. obliga-
tions to Mrs. Van C-; and, packing a portion of
my wardrobe (now somewhat scanty) in a small bundle,
I turned my steps westward. Crossing the Potomac a
little above Georgetown, I walked several miles-I
know not how far-on the Virginia. side, until fatigue
compelled me to stop. I sat down on a log by the
wayside, and again pondered upon what~ was to be
done. If I could not endure the labour of walking,
could I hope for employment as a labourer? I re-
traced my steps to the city. Mr. K-.---- had met
with better success in' his second effort. An advertise-
ment in "The Intelligencer" led him to make applica-
tion at the Columbian Academy,' on Ninth street. The
next morning I was duly installed as second usher of
the school, at a salary of one hundred and fifty dollars
per annum.
The building was large, and painted white. It had
green shutters, and was surrounded by small shade-
trees. It was neatly fenced, too, and, together with
the other buildings, (the classical department, lodging-
room, and recitation-rooms,) presented a very neat and
pretty appearance. The walks were nicely gravelled,
8

and the shrubbery and flowers made the place far more
atjractive than is usual in the grounds of a. school.
It may be readily supposed that I looked somewhat
eagerly at my new employer. He was truly a remark-
able man. His head was already white as snow, yet
there was a military erectness, activity, and vigour,
oftener belonging to thirty-five than to~ sixty. He was
dressed, too, in a blue coat of military cut; and his
white hair was brushed erectly, giving him a somewhat
stern expression. This, however, was contradicted by
the kindly glance of a gray eye and one of the plea-
santest of smiles.
The academy was ~divided by a half partition, sepa-
rating, but not concealing from each other, the pupils
of different ~sexes. Midway on the west side, between
two doors,. (one for the girls, and the other. for the
boys,) was the principal's own desk, to which he
ascended by a number of steps. In front of this, and
lower, was the desk of the principal usher, and, in
front &amp;f that, a chair, around which~ the classes came
in succession. On each side of these desks were
several rows of forms, capable of seating abou1~ two
hundred pupils. In the rear were the recitation-rooms,
which were provided with black-boards, and the lodg-
ing-rooms.
* I had not obtained a sinecure. A furious ringing of
the bell at daybreak summoned me to my toil. Full
of. life and ambition, the pupils came. thronging in. I
assisted in hearing the morning tasks until seven
o'clock. We then breakfasted. At eight we recoin-
xrnrnced our labours. At twelve we dined. At one we
again entered the school, and remained there until
about five in the afternoon. In addition to all this, I.
had copies to* write, and from fifty to one hundred pens
to make, daily,. besides aiding my employer in making
out bills. He was the mo~t industrious man I ever
knew. his ~choo1 was a model of order, neatness, and
regularity.. not a man of extensive in
Although                        acquirements

those branches which he professed to. teach, the Church
of Rome could prefer no stronger claims to infallibility.
It put him in a passion to call his dicta in question.
He maintained, on . all occasions, that his school wa&amp;
the best in the Union, and the inference was irresisti..~
ble, (and I have sometimes thought, correct,) that he
was the best teacher. He was so, undoubtedly, in very
many respects. He had-as had his puplls-..-.the genu-
ine esprit de corps. He was active, vigilant, indefati-
gable. He had served in the army, and his school,
like his dress, had a military cast. He was proud of
his profession, and that pride was the fnoving-principle
of his life. It gave tone to every word, and look, and
action. It never slumbered. Of course he was suc-
cessful. He built no less than three academies in
Washington, the grounds of which, through his indus
try and. taste, are now among the ornaments of the
city.
This professional pride, by-the-by,
greater or less extent, in all m&amp;n. It is. found, to a

If he be a farmer, his Durham is. the greatest of
Durhams; if a musician, Paganini himself had not such
a violin. Has he a son? Vicious as all the world may
think him, he is removed from school to escape the
contamination of bad comp~my. .The Boston Mutual
Admiration Society was, after all; the exponent of a
great fact.
I am digressing. To return to my employer.
lie had rne fault-"thi fault of hi~ day-that of oc-
casional severity. Bnt, on the other hand, he was im-
partial, just, honest, patient, faithful, prompt, generous.
He was one of the United Irishmen, and came to
America in 1808, if I remember well. If the citizens
of Washington ever build~ any local monuments, let the
first be erected to JOHN McJ~EoD.
Irksome as was the toil of the school-room at first, I
became accustomed to it, and loved it. As there was
no school on Saturdays, I had 9pportunities to visit
the capitol, and to see the lions of the three cities. I
was far, however, from being contented. I was de-
sirous to return to college and graduate, and the salary
I was then receiving would not allow me to think of
doing so sooner than three or four years. Accordingly
I inserted an advertisement in "The National Intelli-
gencer," as follows :-.
"TEACHER'S NOTICE.-.-A young man from Clinton
College, who has spent three years in that institution,
wishes to procure a situation as a teacher. Refer to
the lion. Messrs. A.- and 11-, of the House of
Representatives."
The advertisement was so far successful as to obtain
me, through the kind, offices of my friends, a small
school in the country, at a salary of four hundred dol-
lars. I bought the necessary books, and recommended
my studies. Too eager, however, to be prudent, I rose
before day and studied late at. night. The very natural

consequence was ill health, and I left my school and
went home.
It was a little after nightfall when I reached tny
native village. I had left my trunk at the little village
some four miles distant, where the steamboat touched,
and travelled to 2Boylston on foot. Leaving the road,
as I entered the village, I walked along the Ledge
until I was opposite Allan Grftyson'5, and, without any
definite purpose, descended and passed the house. On
a rude bench beneath the patriarchal elm, that threw
its long branches over the house, I thought I could dis-
tinguish a human form. I approached, and there, with
her head leaning, as in* sadness or ~weariness, on her
hand, sat Jessie Grayson.
"Jessie !" said I, in a low tone.
"Dear Lynde! is it you? When did you come ?"
"I have just arrived here, and if you knew how
glad-Jessie! dear Jessie! i~ love you! I have loved
you for years. Will you be mine ?"
"Lynde! hear me. Had you, a year ago; said to
me what you have now uttered, I could have made but
one reply, and the sooner because mi~fortune had fallen
upon you and yours. Events have occurred, hQwever,
during your absence, (I know not whether you have
heard of them,) which leave me but one reply-I can-
not be yours, and we must not meet again I"
"But"-.-
"Do not try to change my decision. It is unalter-
able. Farewell'! and may God bless you !"
Before II could reply, she had left me and entered
the house. I stood for a mQment benumbed--paralyzed
by the crushing sense of misery that followed her part-
ing words, and then, with frantic speed, I retraced my
steps to the Ledge, and entered the woods. I plunged
through its recesses in a delirium of excitement, taking
no heed of the direction, ~and at length, exhausted by
my furious speed, sank upon the ground at the fo6t of
an enormous pine.
I recalled ~he scene, beneath the elm. Could I go

How should I best find an oblivion for the past? The
wide world was before me.
"I will go," said I, aloud, and I rose and went on-
ward.'. I was near the lake.
CHAPTER XIV.
THE DEPARTURE.AN UNEXPECTED MEETINO.-MR. LYNDE WEISS
ARRIVES IN ALBANY.
APPROACHING the shore of the lake, I followed it
along at a rapid pace. The lights of the steamer were
already visible, and I l~pd barely time to reach the
wharf at Allenville. when she arrived. She came
swiftly along until she was within a few hundred yards
of the wharf, when, at a tap of the bell, her wheels
stopped. With her headway sensibly checked, she
rounded to quietly and gracefully, -~~hile her pretty
yawl shot from beii~ath her quarter, and came rapidly
to the shore. As ~he left the wharf, a band on board
struck up the familiar air of "A Life on the Qcean
Wave," and, as the notes swelled out upon the stillness
of the night, they gave a new direction to my thoughts.
Yes, thought I, as. we left the wharf, the sea is the
home for me now. 'The hissing of the steam now
ceased. The boat was run up, as if by magic, and the
beautiful steamer glided away to the air of

"What fairy4ike music
Steals over the sea."

V

The' u~sic, 4he throng of passengers, and the excite~
tn~nt :of 4~e new scene, restored me to something like
quiet, and ;i~iy heart smote me for having thus abruptly
turned toy badi upon kindred,. iend~, and home.

I stifled reflection, however. Like Young Rapid, I was
always restless-always disposed to "keep moving,"
for the motion's sak~. The speed of the cars, when
they are making thirty miles in the hour-.the topmost
speed of a fine horse-the bounding of a ship over 'the
billows two hundred and fifty geographical miles in a
day,-are to me sources of the keenest sensations of
physical pleasure. At midnight I retired.
When I awoke the day. was breaking, and the men
were warping the steamer . through the Elbow. We
were soon at the wharf. A few steps brought me -to
the packet, and, in ten minutes more, we were under
way upon the muddy canal. We had a merry passage.
There was an Irish comedian on .board, whose humour
provoked humour in everybody. He kept the table in
a roar at dinnertime; and when, after the tables were
removed, he tapped a vendor of patent-medicine , fami.
liarly on the shoulder and said, "I say, Sarsaparilla,
let's go on deck!" the victim hirn~elf was obliged to
join in the boisterous peal of laughter.
It was nearly. night wh~n we arrived at the borough
where we were to take the cars for Troy. As. we left
the packet, a peor, weary-looking woman sat on the
deck, holding in her arms &amp; pale, emaciated child. The
passengers rushed past her without so much as a kindly
glance. The Irishman, .however, stopped for a moment
as he passed them, and, laying his hand gently upon
the head of the little sufferer, sai~1, in a low tone,
"Poor little thing !" The mother looked up at the
unexpected greeting. She made no reply, but her fine
~eyes filled with tears as she looked her thanks. I shall
not soon forget that glance.
It wi's somewhat late when I reached Albany. As I
sat in the bar-room, a tall,~ pale young man came in,
and sat down quite near me. Two or three other
young men soon followed. They must h~ve Leen ac-
quaintances, .1 imagine, as he accosted one of them in
this wise:
"11ev y&amp;u got any. corns ?"

"Yes; why?"
"'Cause I can cure 'em. Got some salve here that'll
cure 'em in a week; and no mistake. Like to git a~
box ?"
"Thank you, not this morning."
"Don't you want to go a whaling' ?" asked the corn-
exterminator, finding that his nostrum was not in de-
mand.
"A whaling? "
"Yes?"
"Why? You a'n't no agent, are you ?"
"No, but my uncle is.' S'pose you go round and
see him."
"No, thank you! B'lieve I won't go a whaling' t~his
hitch.'~
The young man who had come in last now left the
hotel, and I found myself alone with the corn-doctor.
"Did you say that your uncle was an agent for a
~whaling company ?" I asked.
"Yes; "ud you like to go ?"
"Perhaps so. What are the inducements ?"
"Oh, good pay-good liv~n'-no work to do-goin'
and comm' all the time in fine weather. 'S'pose you
go round and see Uncle Tom."
We went to the shipping-office. Conspicuously upon
the door shone a flaming advertisement in capitals and
exclamation-points.
"NOTICI~!
~~ONE HUNDRED MEN WANTED!!!
"The subscriber wishes to obtain 100 active~ able-
bodied young men, (Americans,) to go on a whaling

"Good 'morning !" said Mr. Tubbs, as we entered.
His urbanity wa~ truly Parisian. "aood morning,

is carried on under the equinoxious line, where it's all
summer, and no longitude! Good pay, good grub,~-.

"Wal, anyway, he went out, and come back a boat-

smarter'n him. The way them whalemen make money
beats aWnatur. You'd better go."
"How long are the voyages ?"
"'Bout eighteen months; mebbe tew years. Here's
the shippin'-papers."
"Where. is the ship ?"
"At New Bedford. No particular ship, ye know.
You sign the articles, and the agents find you a ship."
"But I have not money enough to go to New Bed-
ford."
"Oh, that's nothing . Bless your heart, the agents '11
pay your expenses there, and your board while you are

"And how about clothes ?"
"The agents, man-the agents. They furnishes yew
with close, and a good chist, and tubacker to trade with
the natyves. They'll trust ye for all out, till ye come
back."
The corn-doctor's attention, it would seem, had been
previously drawn to the attractive features of the
whaling-service, and the powerful imagination . of the
eloquent Mr. Tubbs had so far deepened the impres-
sion; that, with a little p&amp;rsuasion on my part, he con-
sented to sign the articles 'and go with me. We left

Albany that very evening by one of the river-boats,
and, at sunrise the next morning, we were in the office
of one of the New York agents. After examining us
very much as a butcher would examine a bullock, he
decided that we "would do," and at five o'clock in the
afternoon he shipped us on board one of the Sound
steamers for Providence. Our passage was paid by a
man who had it~ (in company with half a dozen other
"green hands") in special charge.
When the bell rang for supper, I took my seat at
the table. I had nearly finished a hearty meal when
the steward saluted me with-
"Your ticket, sir, if you please."
"I haven't any.
"Fifty cents, then, will do."
"I haven't so much about me.'
"Thei~what the devil are you doing here ?"
"There's a man on deck that has charge of me."
"Has charge of you ?"
"Oh, you're a whaleman ?"
"I'm going to be."
"Wal, jist allow me to insinuate, in the politest way
in the world, that you're in the wrong box. You take
a deck-passage. Y6u'veiao sort o' right in this cabin,
nor be-aft the wheels."
'~ I went on deck-forward. There were a score~ of
poor Irishwomeri lying about on' the baggage and
freight. The.y looked half-starved, emaciated, sick,
hopeless. "God help them !" I said to myself. The
night was cold. It had' been a "raw, rheumatic day,"
and the night-ugh! I shiver to think of it. Our
driver did not engage berths for us, and I had no
money. The cold, raw wind rushed through the gang-
ways in freezing currents, and, drowsy, weary, shiver-
ing with cold, wet, (for the rain began to fall about ten
o'clock in the evening)-oh! what a night was that!
II had been 'confined, for many months, to the chool-

baggage..
"Don't you belong forward?" said some. one to me,
in tones not the gentlest in the world.
"Yes, but".-.
"Never mind the buts; you must stay forward."
And forward I went,. and looked gloomily around
upon my fellow-sufferers. God help The poor! It was
not yet day when we arrived at Providence. We were
hurried into a dirty, half-warmed car, which was filled
with smoke by a filthy tin lamp, that emitted a faint,
phosphoric gleam, but a most decidedly
"Ancient, and a fish-like smell 1"
Some of the "greenies waxed jocose 'over our mise-
ries. One was a journeyman tailor. Another had been
driving a charcoal-wagon. A third was a blacksmith.
The rain clattered furiously against the panes. Day
'at length dawned.

"There 'tis now !" said a third.
A Frenchman, who had hitherto kept silence, now
tapped the lid of a venerable snuff-box, and having
passed it very politely to his neighbours, averred, with
a shrug, that he was "6ie~z aise dat we was arrive."
"So, dat isoh New Petford !" said a Dutchman be-
hind me.
The cars stopped. We were huddled" into a coach,
and, after a short drive, we were' set down at the Rev.
Mr. L-~-'s boarding-house. lie was a worthy man,
though irritable' to the last degree. His partner was
one of the most generous men I ever knew. The old
housekeeper was a clever body, (in the American signi-
fication of that word,) and there were some two or
three younger' women. There were, at least, a score

of boarders, and such a medley I never saw. Divers
kindreds and tongues," a variety of size, and all
cornplexio~~, from Day &amp; Martin to Caucasian. Maf-
fit's and Knapp's melodies were then in vogue, as much
as the Ethiopian strains now-a-days, and a broth of a
boy from the Emerald~ Isle declared it to be the
"hoith o' fun," when he could engage all hands in
singing
"011! I'i~i bound for the land of Canaan !"
in a roisterly chorus, ~o loud as to bring old L- to
the door in a tearing passion.
"I do declare !". he would say, "I do declare, I will
not have such a disgraceful noise kept up here,!"
It is a somewhat significant fact that Mr. L-
selected the very leader of all the numerous instruments
of household disturbance, to act as moderator in his
absence ! The said moderator being none other than
my friend the corn-doctor.
Those were memorable days,-~marked by no im~
portent events, not stamped with blood-thrilling in-
cidents,-but they were a strange page of my book of
- life. 'II wandered through the busy streets of the city
of palaces, pondering on the chances that had brought
me there. I saw much of life in those days. ]3e.fore,
IL had looked more intently on the merl3 mechanism of
* society. Now I began to examine, with a hungry man's
earnestness, "the living creature within the wheels."
As I wandered about the streets, an occasional gleam
of life's sunshine caught my eye. It was a curly-headed
child, mayhap, at play among the flowers; a 'home-
scene ;-sire and mother and child in a group; dimly,
and but for a moment, seen through an open door or
window. It was, perhaps, a little band of worshippers
in some "upper chamber," (I have an especial liking
for life in chambers,) joining in some stirring' hymn
that conjQred up many a Sabbath-scene of home; or
the simple annals of the fishermen of Galilee. A coach
rolled by me, and a fair face was visible. A fine eye,

arrested by the earnestness of mine, sought, in That
passing glance, to interpret it. Children gambolled
along the sidewalks. They had forgotten, if they had
ever known, or .heard, that Want had yet her altars,
reeking with the heart's blood of hecatoinbs. The lover
and his mistress passed me. I envied them, and sighed.
Age passed me, and looked kindly upon me for a mo~
ment-.and passed on. *The merchant saw me. My
garb told him my destination. He looked as if his
thought were, "The~ sea is no place for you ;" and
passed on. I learned much of life, and poverty waa

WAITING FOR A SHIP-LIFE IN NEW 'BEDFORD-DR. DODGE-.
HAND-WRITING 0N TH~ WALL.
THERE is, perhaps, no class of men that" is made up
of so many and so odd Yarieties as that of sailors. It
is the first thing the landsman remarks on becoming
acquainted with sea-faring men. There is, it' is~ readily
granted, diversity of character among all classes of'
laborers; but at sea, just 'as you go abruptly from
burning suns to' polar snows; so you leave the middle
range of unremarkable characters for the very poles of
oddity, originality, and inconsistency.' This is especially
true of our men-of-war; where a sprig of nobility jos-
ties a sprig of the law, ~liere all parties and sects, all
kindred and tongues are more or less adequately repre-
sented. The decayed or runaway gentleman messes
with boors and charcoal-venders. Clergymen and doe-
tors~.-their occupations 'gone--feast intellectually side
by side, preaching practical homilies with the holy-stone

mis of the foretopmast, and making ~in external appli-

cation of "slush'~' (grease) to the same spar. Every
trade and profession is represented. Qecasionally' you
find before. the mast a skilful navigator. indeed, it is
considered one of the last of~ possible dangers, at sea,
that, were the captain and officers to die, no one can be
found' to navigate the vessel to her destination, or to the
nearest consulate.
ii make these remarks by way of preface to the state-
ment that I found at my boarding-house a medley of
characters, the. oddity and diversity of which were won-
derful. There was .a musician, a young man of fine
acquirements, who played the flute to perfection. An-
other was an accomplished violinist. There was a
blacksmith, a schoolmaster, a stage-driver, a brick-
layer, a crier of charcoal; a Dutchman, a' Frenchman,
three Portuguese, a Spaniard, two South-Sea Islanders.
Among others, was the corn-doctor of whom I have
spoken. He was something of a character. He, was a
bundle of inconsistencies. He had, apparently, the
very nicest feelings of honour, yet I had more than one
proof that he was unscrupulous in the pursuit of any
object in which he was really interested. He was a
new phase of character to me. He was ceaselessly
scheming. lie could' see, in the simplest actions of
others, parts merely of some preconceived plan. He
could not conceive of any action without an express de-
sign. He had a smattering~ of law, thedogy, French,
chemistry~-what not? He loved large words. He
spoke mysteriously of his ancestry.
"You don't know me, Weiss; you never will ;" he
said to me one day.
"I do not seek to "'
"Yeu would be surprised, if you knew my ancestry(
"No doubt."
And then he would leave th~ subject. He was tall,'
well-formed, and singularly easy and gentleman-like in
his bearing~; yet inclined tQ 1~e authoritative, overbear~
ing,, and self-important. With all his faults, he was
st4ctiy temperate. He had a keen sense of the ludi-

LYNDE WEISS.
crous, and a fund of humour ~withal, that' made him .a.
very pleasant companion. I took a strong liking to
him. Not that I was blind to his faults; but he seemed
to have a special liking for me. He' was anew volume'
to me. He, by design, or otherwise, put me on .remark-
ably good terms with myself; and what With this, and
our inevitable daily association, I became so much at-.
tached to him that I was never happy away from him.
He seemed equally devoted to me. I Was too poor to
suspect him of interested motives'; and so we became
inseparable friends. We walked, rode, sailed to~
gather.
New Bedford is a charming city. Its streets are well
laid out, comfortably paved, and beautifully shaded.
The sea-approach to it is very fine. The scenery is
picturesque. There are no 'grand features; but there
is a diversity of hills, islands, capes, and bays, that
make it a gem of a scene in summer. We found, in our
rambles, some 'half-a-score of views of it, among which
it was not easy to select the best. ~These, and the roads
through the surrounding woods, whiled 'away many an~
hour for. us that would otherwise have hung heavily
upon our hands. The spring was ripening into summer.
The grass' was green again in the fields; the wild-flow-
ers decked the hedges; the birds were singing; and
the trees were putting on their summer drapery of'
beauty. And then the glorious sunshine! The bay,
its surface broken into countless ripples by the breeze,
glistened in its beams. The fiercer winds of March had
given Place to airs as gentle and wellnigh as warm as
the trades of the South Sea; and I fretted at the delay
which kept me a pensioner upon the outfitters.
My friend, the doctor, was not so enthusiastic, lie
was, despite his eccentricities,, eminently a practical
man. He had vastly the advantage of me in the savor
vivre. lie acted on system in all things; while I de-
tested all schemes and plans. It 'is really a wonder
why I liked him '80 well. With all my warmth of feel-
'ing, I was never popular among my asso~iates.~ No one


I

LYNDE WEISS.

took liberties with me. No one sought my company, as
a general thing. The boarders always prefixed the Mr.
to my name; while Tom, Dick, Joe, UIarry~ and the like,
were in the current style of address.
in this respect the doctor was my opposite. He had
always a knob of listeners about him. He could tell
~" a good story." I could not.
He contrived, somehow, to be always in funds; and
he seemed angry if IL would, not accept from him 8uch
trifling amounts as these cheap enjoyments usually cost
us. lie won, from me, gradually, my whole history.
With a boy's earnestness I told him, over and over
again, of my native village; ~f my earlier history; and
my "whole course of love." And he was so courteous
a listener that I was never tired of repeating to him
what seemed, for some reason, to be of so much interest
*to him.
The weather was unfavorable for the carpenters,
and we waited long for the good 'ship, "The Whale~
hunter," to be pronounced ready for sea. Week after
week passed, during which IL tried to become accus-
tomed to going aloft, and to learn something of "the
ropes." Meanwhile, Doctor Dodge, (such was his name
at the boarding~hou8e,) on more than one occasion, pro-
posed to me to run away. He also hinted to me the
feasibility of projects of his .own, which would infalli~
lAy enrich us both; and when he spoke of my home, he
had nearly won me to-hjs purpose. What they were I
knew not, nor do I know now. IL am in doubt whether
he haZ any we~et~ned purpose. It was his nature to
scheme, and what he sought to do was never done by
direct means, so long as indirect agencies were at all
practicable. He constantly asserted that he was going
to sea and in the same' ship with me. 'The "Whale-
hunter," he s~iid, was his e~p~cial favourite, and,
though he. did not wish to e~t~r the whaling-service, he
would sooner do so than part with me!
When, at length, the ship wa~ ready to 'haul out into
the ~tre~4 Captain Beverly was announced to be sick.

It was 'more 'than a fortnight before he recovered. Oh,
how wearily the days dragged their"' lingering length"
Besides Doctor Dodge, there was one other person to
whom I became attached. This was the superintendent
of the boarding-house. He was a quiet an~I unassuming
man, and a general favourite among the boarders.~ lie
was remarkably unselfish. He 'had a smile and a kihd
word for everybody. He did not admire my ~friend

With these two exceptions, I had little to say to
any of the household. I 'do not make acquaintances
readily, as a general thing. I retained my pride, not-
withstanding my change of garb,' (the outfitters had
given me a sailor suit,) and although 'I was not con-
sciously reserved, my bookish habits and flianner, or
something else, kept the boarders aloof from 'me. They
could not avoid noticing my efforts to learn~ something
of my. new employment. I' found myself gradually
'forming the habit of regarding the sea as my future
stage of action, and I was ~not ~ little gratified, one
day, by hearing one of the' boarders say to another.-.--'
"Queer feller, that. 'Smart seller, tew, I guess.".
"Yes," said the other. ".Be a skipper, one o' these
days, I'm thinking. "
The day was announced for hauling off into the
stream. It was but 'a few 'days before that occurrence,
that my friend Wellfleet, the superintendent, eam6 to
me and eaid-.
"Weiss, what say you to a walk ?"
"Where do you propose to go 7"
"Oh, not far. 'I want you to see and hear a friend

"A clergyman?"
"Yes."
"These are not Precisely the garments to go into

my friend C- will think quite as well, of you in
these as in the finest."
"Well, 'I will go. Why not ask all the boarders ?"
"I have."
"And they will ge?"
Armin-arm we departed, nigh a 'score of us, and,
~fter .a walk of about a mile, we found ourselves at a
small, 'neat chapel. The bell had ceased. ringing ere
we arrived, and we entered in the same order as we
had come. The services had' already commenced. The
worshippers were singing to a sweet air, full of 'energy.
"Awake, my soul! stretch every nerve,
And press with vigour on !"
I looked at the occupant of the desk. . He was a
man of, small stature. He had a fine head. His eye
was full' of earnestness and devotion, and his manner
inspired m~ with a reverence akin to awe. iXe prayed,
the little congregation 'all.'kneeling. I can never forget
the soft' low, earnest, musical tones, of his' voice.

above his head-
~'TIME ROLLS ON; ETERNITY hASTENS,

An eloquent sermon followed, and then the worship-
pers sang the beautiful .air which may be known to my
readers as Naomi:
"'Path~'r'! whatever of earthly liliss,

known no .more of each other than We could learn Ia
that evening's aequaintanee; but he looked earnestly.
at me when he bade me good~night,. and said-
"You and I would never quarrel, I. think." And
he left me. I had, years afterwards, cause to recall.
the remark.
The, next evening there was a meeting.-.~ conven-
tion, it was eaile~l.-.-.-of the abolitionists, I found
Liberty' Hall thronged, and Wendell Phillips was thrill-
ing the multitude with his eloquence. Jove! in what
a delirium of excitement did his burning eloquence.
leave me! He speaks, and lectures even, withetit
notes. But his memory is so tenacious, his reasoning
faculties so strong, his command of language so extra-
ordinary, that you sit, entranced by. the astonish1
union of so much grace and elegance with profoun.
and critical learning.
My moVning walk was usually to the wharf, where
"The. Whale-hunter" lay. She was a' beautiful ship.
of about four' hundred tons. I accustomed ~m~y~self to
going aloft, in order that it might be a less irksome
task at~ sea. It was some~ time, however, before I ven-
tured above' the cat-harpings, aiid when I did accom-
plish that memorable feat, I clung with might and
main to the topmast rigging, a~nd looked tremblingly
downward upon the deck, as distant, to my lubberly
vision, as the realms of Pluto from upper air. I soon
overcame this timidity; and was quite at home any-
where about the. ~bip' except the jib-boom----a place
which, though I never shrank from going there, I
dreaded.whe.n I had been months a~t sea.
I was fond of conversing with 'the patient, pains~
taking old carpenters who were sheathingg "The Whale.
hunter's" d'ael. They. told~ me, one of them particu-
larly,' some fearful' tales of the 8~OIP To these, sailors,
who were arriving now and theii, .gave m~ horrid addi-
tions, recommending 4Liue to stay at 'home an&amp; dig
ditches, rather. th~~i. go to seas My answer was ready~
No; I had resolved to go at least one' voyage.


104                LTNnE WEISS.
cordingly, when we were summoned one morliing to
have an interview with the captain, I went with several
others to the office of Messrs. Twist &amp; Screw, the
aget~ts. I must do them the justice to say that they
treated me with uniform kindness, and, so far as r
could discover, j;he utmost fairness. Both were ger~tle~
man-like, and stood fairly among their fellow-citi~ens
as merchants 'and as men. So far,' therefore, as I, am
c6ncerned, and so far as I am acquainted with "outfit-
ters," they are not always the ghouls they have been
represented to be.
Captain Beverly appeared well. He was of large
stature, and somewhat inclined to corpuloncy. His
features were regular, and he was decidedly handsome.
He looked manly and good-humnoured, and, from all I
could see, IL set him down as being conscientious, firm,
and decided, but well-tempered; such a man as sailors
mean . to describe when they say, "You always know
where to find him."
I do nOt know', how far I' was distinguishable by my
own dress and habits, but niy observation~ soon .taught
m~ie to know' a candidate for the whaling-service at sight.
He goes to New Bedford in quite a flow of. animal
spirits, with pleasant visions of "a home on the rolling
deep." He lnts heard, and perhaps sung, the chorus
of the 'fine, old song-
So happy are we,
mining Fearless and free,

He. has' heard of the, green 'isles-houri homes, of the
South' Seas-of the fruits of the' tropics-of lands of.

and pork are as salt as salt can make them). to give it a
relish. He has not dreamed that. captains, of the sua-
viter in modo stamp on shore, may be of the fortiter in
re genus on board the ship. Some disheartened whaTe~
man, who has returned from a four years' voyage penni-
less, tolls him "his experience." The tyro lowers his
crest, forswears thin potations, and taketh. to gin-.-
smokes a pipe-swears lustil~y-4doff~ hi~ "shore togs,"
and calls everybody "shipmate." At last his vessel
hauls off into the stream, and an hour or two in grind-
ing "old irons" (he being employed, in turning the
grindstone) begins to rob "the deep, blue sea" of some
of its romance.

CHAPTER XVI.
UNEXPECTED ARRIYAL.~TREACHERY.~T~ QUAflREL.
A PEW days before the one appointed for hauling into
the stream, I .was surprised by a most unexpected oc-
currence. Mr. Wellfleet came in about sunset one
evening, and handed me a note. I was still more as-
tonished to and it in my uncle Hugh's hand, and with-
out a postmark..
"Of course, he is in town 7" 1 said to Mr. Welifleet.
"Yes! at the Parker House."
"You have seen him, perhaps."
" Yes, several times."
II opened the note, and read a~ follows:
"PARKER ROUSE, Thursday evening.
"My DEAR IJYNPE :---We were uneasy about you,
and, after some days' inquiry, we traced you to New
2Redford. Now, we (Mr. Grayson, Jessie, and Kate

affected his health and spirits; so much so, indeed, that
he felt unequal to a journey from Boylston to this city.
I need hardly say to you that, under these circum-
stances, it is very desirable for you to accompany us
home~ Do not desert us, Lynde. We have interest
enough t&amp; establish you in business; or, if' you so pre-
fer, Counsellor'S--" will give you a seat in his olfiee
as a student. ~Jome .and see me, or shall I wait upon
you at .your quarters?
"Your affectionate uncle,
I was l6ng in coming to a decision. I thought of my
father, and resolved to go home; and then Jessie Gray-
son's rejection of my suit determined me to go to sea.
Was it possible, I asked myself', that sh~ knew the pur-
pose of my uncle's coming? No. She had too much
native delicacy for that. Had i~iy uncle relied on the
sight of her face, and the calm unanswerable logic of my
sister Rate, to persuade me to forego my purpose?
Again I thought of my father, and decided to go home.
Mr. Welifleet came in, as I closed the debate, end i~d-
vised me very earnestly to abandon the idea of ~going
to sea.
"You have for many.years been a student,'.? said he.
"The habits of your whole life unfit you for the Ia-
bours and hardships ~f the sea. You have been deli-
cately nurVured,-~you will be exposed to hardships al-
most beyond the power of endurance. You have been
accustomed to good society; you are going among the
lowest and most filthy, vulgar, and obscure of the dozen
nations which you will dind represented in theforecastle.
You have never known the want of wholesome and
palatable food; as~ a sailor, you must know it. You
have been accustomed to regular and unbroken sleep,-

"I will."
"You will?"
"Yes."
"That's right. I congratulate you. 'Come, let's go
to the Parker House, and ~ee your uncle."
"Not in this dress."
"Never mind the dress. Walk by the hotel with me,
and if you would rather not go in, I'll call your uncle.
out, and you can walk with, him. If you want ~money
or clothing, that is very easily arranged: I can supply:
you, and you may pay me at your leisure. By-the-by,
do you know that your uncle has been here for several'
days?"
"No."
"He came on Monday. It was with some difficuhy
that ~he found you, and he hardly knew, he says, how
to begin the negotiation."
"That is surely no very difficult matter."
"Why, I do not know," said Mr. Welifleet, with a~
significant smile. "Boys are~ obstinate, you know;
sometimes. By-the-by, now I think of it, where's your
friend Dodge ?"
"I am unable to say.
"He has decamped, I suspect."
"Hardly."
"At any rate, he has not been at the house since
Monday, and this is Thursday evening. However, it's
time we were going."
Drawing my arm through his own, Mr. WelllIeet then
walked with me to the Parker House. He left me at
the door 'and entered' the~ hotel.
"Come in; Weiss," said he, as he came back.
"They're all at tea, and nobody will see you."
I followed him into the 'hotel, and up a single flight
of stairs. He advanced a few steps and then paused.
"That's the room, No. -," said he, as he pointed to

the sound of voices. For one of them, I could have
sworn it was that of one who was still dear to me; I
could hear the throbbing of my heart as I stopped to
listen. There wa~ a man's voice in reply. I stepped
forward. . There, kneeling at the~ feet of Jessie Gray-

,DR. DODGE DISAPPEARS.. UTFITS.4JAULIN.G OFY-A DAY IN TUE
BThEAM.
M~ uncle, it seems, kr~ew me too well to remonstrate,
and I did not see him at~all. Doctor Dodge disap-
peared. Two days after the occurrences of the last
chapter, the outfitters sent for us to select our outfitst4
My own allotment was a monkey jacket, round jacket,
trousers for warm and cold weather, shirts, stockings,
tarpaulins, blankets, and a hay bed. I am but an in-
different financier, but I thought the prices reasonable.
The outfitters were certainly very liberal, and they dis~
armed me of my prejudices against them.
The day came to haul into the stream. Qur 8ky~
blue chests were high up-piled on a stout truck. We
bade the outfitters good-by, and left the shop in ~
straggling order, much like a fleet in a gale of wind.
Motley was the "wear." Our chestswere soon huddled
into the forecastle. The fasts were cast off. A warp
was passed to the steamer Telegraph, (of which exploit
pars magnafui.e'). and we were speedily under way. The
pilot leaped up to the night-heads, and testily issued his
orders.
"Starboard!"
"Starboard, sir !"
"Port!"
"Port, sir!"
"Steady!"
"Steady, sir !"

Such were some of the elements of the hubbub. We
anchored opposite the light-house on Clark's Point.
The steamer left us, and we were left to amuse our-
selves as best we might.
I discovered that there were many on board whose
faces I had not before seen. It was the understanding
(I know not whence it came) that we were to have on
board the Whale-hunter a picked crew of young Ame-
ricans. We had, indeed, undergone a. personal inspec-
tion by Captain Beverly, and I supposed that I was
going' to ~see a rather "select society." I found in the
forecastle, however, one Dutchman, one negro, one
Canadian, one Spaniard, one Portuguese, one Chilian,
and a South-Sea Islander, in the number of my ship-
mates. The scene was a queer . one. From such occa-
sional glimpses as I could catch while I arranged~ my
berth, I tried to form some idea of my future mess-
mates. There were some good faces among them.
They were occupied in divers Ways. One was playing
the violin. Another wearied our ears with a wheezing
accordion. Some were playing cards. Some slept.
Some were mending, "fixin' for Cape' Horn," as they
expressed it.
'This, by-the~by, is a singular trait of sailors. You
may see them, in the earlier part of the voyage, putting
patch upon patch, until you cannot divine the original
colour6 Thrift herself would blush at their superior
economy. Well, months, perhaps years, pass away.
Jack comes home with some hundreds of dollars due
him. A thousand to one he is drunk in six hours after
he gets ashore, and his money goes in three dayW or
six; and then he goes to sea again-to economize.
On the following day the wind was directly in our
teeth, and we lay at anchor all day. The Whale-hunter
began to show her mettle, as the long swell rolled in
from seaward, tossing, uneasily at her moorings, and
fretting like a chained mastiff in his kennel. " We
gave her the best bower and a goodly scope of cable,
and she behaved better. There were some faint fore-

LYNDE WEISS.               ill
shadowings of sea-sickness during the day. There was
a very noticeable Solemnity on divers faces. It might
be from grave reflections. It was, more probably, the
"shadows before'7 of events to come when we. should
be fairly at sea. For my own part, I stifled all thoughts
of home. I overhauled my ~chest,. an invaluable re-
sourse to all sailors.' I climbed the rigging; I wrote
in my journal; and so got through' the day.
On the following morning it blew great guns from the
north-west. The captain and pilot, came on 'board, and
we got under way. 'The wind was so fresh that we
could only show whole topsails. The Whale-hunter was
cast to port. She bounded, as she fell off, with a curveb
like a war-horse, and my veins tingled with pleasure as
she gathered way. As the pilot left us, I happened to
look over the bulwarks. A yacht wa~ passing *us.* In.
a group that were seated in the stern-sheets,, I saw a
face that was familiar to me. As I looked, he rose de-
liberately, lifted his hat, and made ihe ,a low salaam,
with a profundity and a malignant smile that cQuld only
belong to Dr. Dodge. A vague presentiment of evil
crossed my mind, and I turned in disgust to the duties
of my new berth. By the time we got the anchors on
the bows and the decks cleared up, it was blowing so
freshly that Captain Beverly thought it prudent to reef
topsails,-and now came my first trial. We were well
out at sea, and the land was growing dim6 'The Whale-
hunter pitched heavily in the angry sea. In common
with others, I felt very decided symptoms of sea-sick-
ness. Some had already gone below. One and an-
other were looking astern, and murmuring "Good-bye
to New Bedford!" when, with the voice of a young
lion, the mate shouted-.~
"Hands by the topsail halyards! Lower away!
Man the topsail clewlines! Qlew down? Haul out
the reef-tackles! Lay aloft there, and take a reef in
the topsails! Two reefs there in the m izzen-topsail!

"Ay, ay, sir!"

"Bear a hand there, now I"'
I bounded after a boat-steerer into the main-rigging,
and followed him to the topsail-yard9 A faint, death-
like sensation came over me as I crawled out on the
toot-rope, and looked' down on the foaming sea. I was
~t "the dog's ear," which is to say, next to the boat-
steerer, who had the post of honour-the hearing, lie
looked around at me as I was trying to assist him in
hauling the sail out "to windward," and seeing how sick
I was, he shouted fiercely-
1''
"Lay down! lay down, man.
This was all Greek to me.
"Go down on deck, you lubber! You ha'n't got the
strength of a kitten! Laydown on deck, afore you
fall overboard! If ye do fall, it's all day with ye! Lay
down; I tell ye, lay down !"
Amid i~i~ smiles of the captain, officers, and all the
~id "sea-~gs," I crawled wearily to the lee-scuppers,
and, in company with half-a-score of poor greenhorns,
paid my matriculation fee by way of initiation into the
occult mysteries of getting my "sea-legs." Of these
I stood in most imperative need, as my limbs were of
little use to me. I was resolved that I would not go
below, I staggered-fell--crawled about deck. I ate
broiled codfish in its quintessential saitness, I drank
sea-water--all to no purpose!
* Anon the people were called aft, and the watches
were formed. 'I was chosen in the captain's watch.
Of this I was very glad, as I had taken a decided liking
* to him. This accomplished, the order was given-

ward, and descended the ladder into the dark forecastle.

CHAPTER XVIIL
A Sun' is the world in miniature. Especially is this
true of a man-of-war.-.-where, it has passed into a pro.
verb, every man finds his level. The sailor whom you
select for your hammock-boy may have been, in more
prosperous days, a man ef wealth and distinction. The
man who helps to pull you ashore in a cutter, or the
dinghy, may have been a man of some eminence in pro-
fessional life. You meet with men of ~li countries, and
the most marked and startling contrast in .habits and
character. In one man you find the mere a~nima4-
dull, 'lifeless, soulless; a machine' almpst.~-not many
degrees above the dray-horse, or the 'treadxnill-~-one
whose brain is not often visited by ideas that are not on
terms of the very closest intimacy with his rations of
beef and grog and his watch below. In another you
see the lubler, who trembles in' a whole-topsail breeze,
and to whom the royal~yard. and the jib~boom are purga~
tory. His messmater is the ambitious. man-who makes
his way patiently, and step by step, from the rate of
Johnny Raw to that of able seaman, captain of a top,
or quarter-master. Another is the jovial "good fellow,"
who can sing a good song, and spin a yarn as long as

firmly as Atlas or Gibraltar .at his post, in the face of
almost certain death.
But to my story.
Night came on. Oh! that first night at sea! The
ship plunged' and reared like a restive horse impatient
of restraint. The sky w~s heavily overcast, and as
'night settled upon the sea, rain added its raw discom-
fort to the' accumulation of other diversities' of misery.
At eight'o'clock, r. ~., just as, in utter weariness and
exhaustion, "an exposition of sleep" came over me, I
heard, in Cyclopian accents, at the scuttle--
"Eight bells, there below!. Tumble up here, now!
No sick4ist to-night! Come ~n deck, all of ye! D'ye
hear, there ?"
."Ay, ay, sir !" growled one of the few "old salts"
who had shipped before the mast.
The forecastle-lamp had gone out, and there was some
delay and' a great' deal of swearing in lighting it.
"Plague take the bloody' ole lamp !" exclaimed the
doctor, (the cook,) who was waiting for Portuguese Peter
to light it. It was lighted at last. I turned out. I
found my jacket "over to leeward," and one of my
shoes 'half-full of' lamp-'oil. With an heroic effort, how-
'ever, I dressed and went on deck, the first of my watch.
I could see nothing in the surrounding darkness, but I
groped my way to the weather~rail, and staggeringly
crawled aft.
"-Come aft here! all of you 1" shouted the captain;
and we were glad to 'get' out of the way of the floods
of water that were dashing over the bows at every
'plunge of th~ ship. Faint, sick, almost exhausted, I
eroi~iched njider the weather bulwarks, somewhat alarm-
~ed, if" the truth must be. said, by the loud, sharp thud
of the swell against the bows, the quivering of the hull,
and the creaking of the bulkheads. The gale abated,
and we made sail to top-gallant sails. Wearily' passed
the first long night-watch, and my heart ~leaped with
'joy when the second mate (the captain had retired 'at
'six bells) shouted-'

"flight bells! Call, the watch !"
"Go below, the wa tch !" was the order a few minutes
later, and we wen~jielow. With a keen sense' of com-
fort I crawled (how, I hardly know) into, my bertha
With a miser-like consciousness. of my ability to sink
instantly to sleep, I remember a coquettish delay to

soundly. It was net yet seven bells in the mid watch
when
"Starboard watch, ahoy !" in a shrill m
started me from a dream of home. , masculine yell,
"All hands! A squall, hoys'! Make haste !"
With a beating heart I bounded up the ladder. As
I stepped U~QT1 deck, the wind took my very breath
away, and I staggered into the lee-scuppers. I crawled
with' some difficulty to windward. The rain was . pour~
ing down in torrents, and the ship was heeled over
almost on her beam-ends. The wind whistled fierce-
ly through the 'rigging. The green hands stood in
mut*e terror, utterly at loss where to go and what to
do. The mate, I could readily see, was himself alarmed,
and he was shouting' and Swearing, giving two or three
Orders in a breath.
I may remark here, in passing, that it is by no means
uncommon for whalemen to sail from port with a crew
in which there are not more than four Or five able Sea-
men in the forecastle. Such was our own: predicament.
Indeed, I doubt whether there was one in the Whale~
hunter's forecastle who would have rated as an able
seaman in the n~wchant-service or the navy.
I now received my first lesson in the management of
a 'ship. As I stood near the booby~hatch, unable to
understand the orders of 'the mate, who was yelling like
a hyena to the men, I saw dimly in the darkness the
tall, manly form of Captain Beverly. He threw 'calmly

a look aloft, and, in a tone of voice, little, if any, louder
than his ordinary gruff, heavy accents, he said quickly,
"Maints'gallant-y-ard, there ~"
" Sir !"
"Wha1~'~ the trouble with that sail ?"
"The clewline 'a jammed, sir."
"Mr. Pintle, see that clewline clear !"
"Ay, ay, sir. All clear!"
"Clew up I"
"ATy, ay, sir I"
"Hands by the topsail halyards! Lower away!
Clew down! haul out the reef-tackles! Who's that at
the wheel?"
"Tom, sir."
"Luff, half a point."
"Ay, aysir. Luff it is."
The ship was now safe. The squall abated, and we
made sail again. I can never forget the calm, yet
prompt and seamanlike style, in which Captain Beverly
restored confidence to the men, and relieved the writhing
spars of a strain that would have carried them by the
board, had they not been of the best material and well
stayed.
It being our morning watch on deck, we scruJ~bed
decks, (a new and very interesting operation to me,
'which, in my greenness I supposed to be a sort of Sun-
day scrub,) and made sail to royals. Of course, we had
the forenoon watch below. I again sought my berth, as

"Whose's' deal ?" "Spades no more !" were among
the expressions that met my drowsy ear. I slept at
last. It could' not have been long; for 'when I awoke,
the players were still intensely, engaged. My Dutch
neighbour was smoking his pipe, and watching 'the gam-
blers. At last they, too, turned in. The little fore-
castle was still. The Dutchtnan's eyes were ~drawing
drowsily together, when, suddenly, a rooster that had
escaped from the hen-coop and 'strayed 'forward, 'set up,
just ~t the scuttle, his very loudest and shrillest crow.
The enraged Dutchman rose on one elbow, 'thrust his
head out of his berth,' and, looking fiercely ~'p the scut-
tle, he growled-.
"Ach! by tam! are you there ?"
A roar of laughter followed; but, at last, about six
bells, the Dutchman snored, and broad chests around
him also snored, and puffed, and "phew"-ed, and snorted

CHAPTER XIX.
FLORES.-FAYAL.-LIFE AT 5EA.-THE FIGHT.
FINE weather succeeded the storm. I recovered
slowly from my sea-sickness; and, as I gre.w more ac-
customed ~o my new home, I began to love the sea. So
it is ever. A wise Providence has so formed us that,
be our abiding-place where and what it may, we learn
to love it. There is always, in every possible condition
of lif~e, the relative good and evil, joy and sorrow,
which settle 'into the ordinary share of happiness which
falls to our lot. Panting beneath the equatorial sun,
or shivering in polar snows, in freedom or in bondage,
tl~ere is so nice an adjustment of the balance of joy and
sorrow, that little ground is left for choice among the
diversities of human condition. There is no shade of
hardship or sorrow but has its corresponding intensity
of comfort and delight. I loved my little berth. I cut
engravings from the papers and magazines that had been
given me, and pasted them upon its rough sides. I fitted
it with a world of bachelor conveniences; and, were
there no other tie, the animal luxury of the delicious
sleep I enjoyed in it would have endeared it to me.
I set myself at work to learn the names and uses of
"the ropes." I was constantly looking aloft to see
where the brftces, sheets, and . clewlines "led." I in-
quired restlessly the names and ixses of every thing.
I was the first among the green hands to take .a trick
(alone) at the wheel; and Captain Beverly complimented
me on my skill. When I was not "looking out" aloft,
or at the ~wheel, I contrived to be at hand where the
officers were fitting the boats, getting their "irons"
(harpoons, spades, and lances) in order; or setting up

rigging. In this way I learned a great deal of sailor
lore in my first month at sea. The fourth mate, a-
negro, was a huge, brawny fellow, and, by report, a
good whalernan. Seeing my desire to learn, he took a
special liking to me, and was never weary in answering,
Again and again, my countless questions. I also took
especial pains, on all occasions, to be first ~n executing
an order. In bracing the yards, in making or taking
in sail, in relieving the wheel or the look-out, it was
my pride to be prompt, active, ever ready. This oh-
tamed me the good-will of the captain and officers.
The former would often call me aft to assist him in
taking an observation; and the latter would select me
from a knot of idlers to assist in working upon the
rigging. What wonder I began to love the sea? ~ ay
after day, in almost uninterrupted sunshine
on towards the Azores.               , we bounded
We had two passengers on board. They were Por-
tuguese, and bound to Flores. As we drew nearer
the islands, one of them (a gray-haired old man, who
had been for many years away from his native islan4,)
was in a fever of excitement. He. was constantly
watching the binacle, and asking a thousand questions
about the course, the latitude and longitude, and the
rate of sailing. Indeed I began to share his excite-
ment as we drew nearer Flores.
Amid all the novelty, however, of life at sea, my
thoughts would wander homeward. In the busy hours
of the. day I could drive away such thoughts easily
enough; but at twilight, in night watches, and in
dreams, my fancy was ever busy with the scenes of
home; and
"My heart, untravelled,"
sought a solace for the present in the recollections of
the past. I remember that I lay down upon my chest
one day, after dinner,, and fell asleep. I dreamed of
home. I was at the well-remen~bered board, and

I

around it were my father and his family, with good old
Allan Grayson and his daughter. I was seated beside
Jessie. It seemed to me, in my dream,, that I had won
her heart' and hand, and that she looked blushingly at
me as I recounted my hardships and adventures since I
left my native village. Suddenly there was a ~pea1~ ofe
thunder. Jove! how faithfully did my fancy recall
the familiar features of every faGe, wearing a ~look of
surprise at the sudden approach of the storm! Knives,
forks, spoons, were dropped, and we looked now at one
another, now at' the window, through which we could
discern the vivid flashes of the lightning. 1V[y elysian
dream was rudely interrupted by simon Nehemiah, the
blacksmith, who bawled hoarsely in my ear-
' ~I say, yaou! Weiss! Rowse out here! *Your trick
at the wheel!"
I bounded up the ladder, discovering, as I did so,
that the cook was grinding coffee, and that he had thus
~unintentionally furnished the thunder for my dream!
"Land ho /" was 'the cry the next morning, and by
noon we lowered the captain's boat and went ashore.
Our,, passengers were half frantic, as well they might
b'e, for Flores deserves its naine.. It is one of the most
beautiful islands I have ever seen. True, it lacks the
vegetation 'of the tropical islaiids of the South Sea; but
then it is so well cultivated, that it looks like one vast
floating garden, in the sea-approach. I could have
kissed the earth, so delighted was I to see, once more,
the beautiful green of broad fields, instead of the wide,
monotonous expanse of sea and sky, on which I had
gazed for the past fortiiight. I had become so much
accustomed to the motion of the ship, that, at first, 1.
could not walk on land without staggering.
While the captain was busy in bargaining for a sup-
ply of fresh provisions-potatoes, onions, fruit, ~iogs,
and. chickens'-I pawned divers little superfluities for
oranges. One ill-looking fellow, whose' "oomple~don"
was "perfect gallows," singled me out for his victim,
and, with wealth of smiles, and an urbanity that would

have made him a prime favourite at court, he contrived
to cheat me most villainously. There was a skill in
his tactics which stamped him a great cheat. He might
have sat for the portrait of Cool, in "London Assu-
rance, and young Courtly's words might very appro~
privately have been written beneath it: "There is a
pungency about his invention and an originality in his
equivocation that are perfectly refreshing !"
We got our supplies on 'board, and sailed for Fayal.
We stood off and on, while the captain went ashore.
On his return we filled away, and, with a sigh, I bade
farewell to beautiful Fayal. Years have passed, yet I
still recall the beautiful Azores-.their hills, valleys,
fields, groves, cascades, and neat white churches and
cottages that decked the hillsides.
I have neglected to say that, for some days pre-
viously to our reaching the Western" Islands, there had
been some ill4'eeling between the larboard and star-
board, or mate's and captain's watches. As I have
already stated, the greater part of the foremast hands
were "green horns." Some of them complained viry
bitterly of the noise, at night, over the forecastle, made
unnecessarily by the watch on deck. There i#as very
reasonable ground for complaint; though, for my own
part, I was so weary with the labour of the day and
my loss of accustomed sleep, that a national salute
would not have waked me, except at the regular hour
for calling the watch. Such is the case with all expe~
rienced seamen. The watches retaliated upon eaeh

last sleepless watch, until, 'at length, the quarrel' be-
came general.
One night, when we were running down the south-
east trade-wind, one of the watch on deck came below,
(I was in my birth,) and struck a light. It proved to
be Simon Nehemiali, the blacksmith. He made so
much noise and remained so long that he was sus-
pected of trying to keep us awake.

stockings.
"Go when I git ready !"
"Go now!"
"Yaou be-~-!"
Brown sprang from his berth and struck the in~
uder. The watch on deck heard the noise, and
hd and the fight became general. They fought
ruse below. The watch below bounded from their
like tigers. The contest was at its height when there
were three heavy raps on the scuttle, and Captain
Beverly shouted-
"Avast, there! Come on deck, all of you !"
"We can't do it, sir," answered Brown.
IAk# a lion springing upon his prey, the captain
leaped into the forecastle. He was a man of enormous
strength, and, striking right and left, he scattered the
combatants as if they were children. I saw him throw
four men headlong against the berths and bulkhead.
"On deck I" shouted he, in a voice that might have
roused the dead, and they obeyed him. He followed
them, and went aft.
"Sen'd Brown aft !" said he to the mate.
"Ay~ ay, sir. Brown, lay aft here !"
He came.
~" Seize that man to the mizzen-rigging !"
The order was obeyed.
"Now, sir, what say you ?" said he to Brown.
"Forgive me, sir !"
"Cast off the lashings. I forgive ypu, but remem-

forward."
There was no ni~re fighting on board the Whale-

oar of the *captain's boat. We pulled lustily for a few
moments, and then made sail. When within a short
distance of the whales, the sails were lowered, and we
took the paddles. In this way we approached, almost
noiselessly, a huge old spermaceti whale that lay with
his back above the surface of the sea, reminding me, in
the single glimpse I caught of it, of' the adventure of
Sinbad the Sailor.
When we left the ship, the fourth mate, who was hold..
ing the steering-oar, constantly urged us to the greatest
possible exertion, by such expressions as
"Pull, my bullies! Will you pull! Weiss? What
d'ye say, there? Sperm whale, boys! Do pull! Say
you'll pull !"
And while he steered with one hand, 'he aided our
little after-oarsman with the other. lie had gradually.
lowered his voice, as we drew near the whales, to a
whisper.
"There they are, boys! Sperm whales! Old set-
tlers. Two hundred barrels apiece! Two years, and
a full. ship! What's the news, now? lYil~ you pull ?"
When within a few fathoms of the whale he had
selected, he said in a low voice, to the boat-steerer,
"Stand up, Ben! All ready! Stan' by, now,
boys! One minute more! Softly! aive it to him,
now, Ben!"
The boat-steerer threw his harpoon with coolness and
skill. We were "fast." The huge monster settled
heavily down, threw his flukes (tail) lazily aloft, as if a.
flea had annoyed him, and "sounded."
"'Mind The line, there, boys !" shouted *the fourth
mate. "Johnson, (the boat-steerer,) come aft, now."
The boat-steerer (whose province it is to throw the
harpoon, and who does' not steer' tb~e boat until after he
has dane so) now took the steering-oar; and Mr.
Butler took his place. By the time' he had taken the
sheath, off' his well-polished lance, the whale ceased
"sounding," and started for the surface. We peaked our
oars, 'and hauled in the slack of the line. As soon as

he' reached the surface, his spout' told us where lie lay,
and we h*~uled the line rapidly inboard. When within
a few~fathoms 'of him, Mr. -Butler threw his lance. It
.struck the whale a little abaft the fin, and with his next.
spout came the blood.
"Spouts blood, boys~! lie's ours !" shouted the ex-
cited mate. ~"Two hundred' bar..--JuMP, Weiss, fur
your life I"
I sprang instinctively from my seat, and was in the
act of following Mr. Butler, who had' leaped overboard,
when the tail of the huge monster struck the bow of the
boat; giving me &amp; blow that paralyzed one of my legs.
I fell helplessly into the sea. ~The mate bad seen the
occurrence, and he caught toy arm ;' supporting himself
by clinging to the boat. The waist-boat happened to be
nearest to us, and she- picked us up. By the time we
were safely on board, the whale turned upon his side-.-
dead. He was towed alongside, and secured by heavy
"fluke chains" to the ship.
Signals were then made to the other boats to return;
but the officers' either could not or wonid not see, and
they kept on 'in pursuit ef the whales. I can give the
reader no' idea '(and he cannot form one adequately) of
the intense excitement of suoh a chase. The race-course
or the gambling-house may give some notion of it. One
of the boats was "fast" to a young whale, (the young
whales are always the most troublesome,) and he was
dragging the boat at a fearful rate~ away from the ship.
I barely caught a glimpse of her, as I was lifted ~on
deck. I was carried below. Night came on. The
doctor (the cook) reported 'to me that "de boats done
gwine out o' sight, and de cap'n ben make a light ou do
try-works."                              -~
The boats did not reach the ship until t~ o'clock.
The 'crew then shorte~ied sail, and preparations were
made for "'cutting in." ~'I should but weary~the, reader

were got on deck, and the work of the "whaling-
ground" was fairly begun. Though suffering much
pain from the blow I had received, I crawled to the
scuttle, and looked out upon deck. The officers and
men were gathered around the try-works, the blaze of
the fires throwing their forms into clear, relief against
the surrounding darkness. The smoke was whirling
away in huge volumes, to leeWard, and hundreds of
storm-petrels were chattering in our wake.
We cruised in that region for several days. During
that time the severe pain I suffered brought on a fever,
by which I was so much reduced~tIiat Captain Beverly
decided to touch at Rio Janeiro, and leave me for medi-
cal treatment. It was desirable, moreover, to touch at
that port, in order to send home the oil we had taken,
amounting to some two hundred and seventy barrels.
This was obtained from the large whale captured'by the
fQurth mate, an&amp; two smaller ones subsequently taken
by the larboard and bow boats.
On arriving at Rio Janeiro, Captain Beverly placed me
under the care of the consul, to whom hegave my pass-
port, and said to me that he proposed to cruise for a
month off Rio Janeiro. If, at the expiration of that
period, I should be able to resume my berth, he would
reserve' it for me. If not, the consul would find me a
passage home. The month passed. The Whale-hunter
returned; but I was yet an invalid, and I sorrowfully
watched the brave ship as she sailed past the Sugar-
loaf and disappeared. A few days later I took passage
'on board the barque Julia, of Salem, for the United
States. We had a pleasant passage of fifty days. It
was on a cold, raw, cheerless day in February that we
landed. Of the money left in the hands of the consul
formeby Captain Beverly, I had fifteen dollars iemain-
ing. I went to a sailor's boarding-house, and, as I laid
my head upon my pillow, my heart throbbed fiercely
;w hen I asked myself what L should do. Go home?
'Never! unless in better plight than I was at that time.
Of' course, I must get employment. But how? where?

127

I was not yet sufficiently restored to be capable of hard
labour. Should I try to get a situation as a teacher?
Alas! I 'was an utter stranger, and I had not a single'
letter of recommendation. I spent several days in the
invention and consideration of different plans of action.
All to no purpose. Sick, disheartened, despairing, I
left the boarding-house one evening, for a walk on the
beach. I crossed the bridge, and walked towards.Mar-
blehead. On my - return I stopped at the wharves,
where a little fleet of "jiggers" and "pinkeys" (fish-
ing-vessels) were lying side by side. As I stood gazing
at them, I saw a bright-eyed Yankee girl busily engagedd
in cooking supper for the crew. She looke&amp; search-
ingly at me for a moment, and I fancied that there was
a gleam of sympathy in her dark eye, asshe said-
"Come aboard, friend! ~Come on deck a minute,
John 1" added she, turning towards the cabin-doors.
"Here's a craft in distress, or I'm no prophet. Come
aboard! come aboard! You're as welcome as a fair
wind !"
I complied with the request.
"On a lee shore, shipmate ?" asked the ~man, (the
captain, as I soon discovered.)
"Yes !"
"Wal, walk below. John Manchester's my name. I
command this jigger, the Norma. 12iet me make you
acquainted with my wife."
I bowed..

" Wal, that's strait forward. I like your looks. Mal~e
yourself tew hum. To-morrow, ef I kin dew, any thing
for ye, why jest say 80. Stop aboard with ua~to~night."
I acc~pte4 the invitation. We had some little chat
the next morning, while breakfast was in preparation,
about matters of general interest; in which, with gen-
tlemanlike delicacy, the captain asked me no questions
touching my history, or my existing embarrassments;
After breakfast, we walked. As we passed ray board~

ing-house, on our return, he again invited me to go on
board the Norma.
"Are you a fisherman ?" I asked, as I took his hand,
to bid him good morning..
"Yes; amack'reler."

"And, give me until to-morrow to decide ?"
"Yes; until nine o'clock' in the morning."
He left me, 'and I entered the boarding-house. The
fim~ hung heavily upon my hands. I read the Pirate's
Own Book, three old almanacs, and all the newspapers
I could find. At nightfall, weary, dispirited, unde-

I went on board the Norma and made the necessary

CHAPTER XXI.
THE JOURNEY HOMEWARD.
THERE was. a raw, frosty chilliness in the air, that
quickened my footsteps, as I set out on my' long jour-
ney. It was the last of September. There had been,
already, several frosts;. and the woods that skirted the
road had put on their many-coloured garb of crimson
and yellow and brown. These shades were thrown
beautifully into relief by the dark foliage of the native
spruce, cedar, hemlock, and pine, which abound in the
interior of New England. I passed through Nashua,
Keene, Walpole, Bellows' Falls, and other towns, on the
much-travelled stage-route, taking the southern~ pass
through the Green Mountains, through Rutland.
Despite the circumstances under which I w~ return-
ing home, every hour's travel lightened my burden of
care and anxiety. I suppose that I must have travelled,
one day with another, about twenty miles a day. Occa-
sionally, my pride rebelled against my resolution to go
home in* my sailor garb; but I mastered the feeling;
consoling myself, to some extent, to say the truth, with
the thought that my unshorn hair and beard, together
with the hronzed complexion I had acquired at aea,
would prevent immediate recognition. At Rutland I
encountered a somewhat serious difficulty; none other
than he utter exhaustion of my little stock of~inoney.
I pondered long upon the means of relief. I had re-
solved that I would not, under any circumstances, write
home for money. Should I beg? Could I? I walked
until noon, when, weary beyond expression, I sat down
on a log by the wayside. A careful examination of my
pockets brought to light a solitary shilling. With this
I stopped at the door of the first farm-house; and,
having eaten my bowl of bread and milk, offered the
coin Vo the good housewife.

"No, sir! we don't take money for trifles like this.
You seem worn out-almost sick. Stay, won't you?
Remain here until morning.,, Have you far to go ?"
"About a hundred miles.
"Well, you will accomplish the distance quite as
soon if you remain here to-night."
I thanked her, but declined the kind invitation, and
told her of the urgency of my journey. Her gentle
eyes glistened as she said good-bye, and my voice re~
fused all utterance, as, with the hot tears on my own
cheek; I pressed the extended hand, and resumed my
journey. As I left the house, it began to rain. From
an impalpable drizzle it grew to a cold, raw, easterly
storm, that beat ruthlessly upon me as I trudged, with
aching limbs, towards home. At length, after many a
weary hour's travel, night came on. There was no
dwelling in sight. The rain had ceased falling-and,
exhausted by the day's travel, I went into the woods
by the roadside, broke a quantity of boughs from the
low hemlocks, an d stretched my tired limbs for a night's
repose.
I slept. When I awake it was broad day. I was
covered with the yellow, withered leaVes. I shivered
with cold-.--and, on attempting to rise, I was almost
frantic with the stinging, aching, nerve-palsying pain
that besieged every joint. Any one who has travelled
through those regions of southern and western Ver-
mont, where the prevailing soil is clay, especially if he
have done so after a protracted "spell" of rainy wea-
ther, will readily understand how slowly and pa~ifully
I forced my way onward through the yielding, slippery,
glue-like mud. A hot, feverish feeling succeeded the
death-like chilliness I had experienced when I awoke,
and I was on the point of yielding in despair to the
feeling of utter helplessness and hopelessness, when I
heard behind me the dull tramp of a horse. I did not
turn my head. I discovered, however, as his large, un-
wieldy horse trotted past me, that it was a man on
horseback. He was a hearty, ruddy, good~humoured&amp;

looking man of forty-five. I observed that he eyed me
with a somewhat keen glance of scrutiny as he passed.
I did not speak, however-contenting myself with the
mental ejaculation-
"Jove! had I but a mule I"
He must have been a reader of faces, for he checke~1?
his horse, and said-.
"So you'd like to ride, eh.?"
"Yes. I'd give the world to ride."
"You shall keep your .share of the world, and have
the ride besides."
"While you walk ?"
"Ay. I've a frame of iron. You're. as frail as a
girl; and there are girl's tears ready to overflow your
cheeks, now. Pshaw! Cheer up, man. Here! put
your foot in the stirrup. What! you can't? Well
then, this will do as well, I take it." And, so saying, he
lifted me, as I would have lifted an infant, into the saddle.
"'Never look sad; nothing's so bad
As getting familiar with sorrow;
Treat him, to-day, in a cavalier way,
And he'll seek other quarters to-morrow!"'
continued my companion, as we jogged along.
"Where do you live ?" he asked.
"In' Boylston." -
"Across the hake ?"
"Yes."
"Do you know George Weiss ?"
"I'm his son.
"~'ou? his son?"
" Yes.~,
"W-h-e-w !" (A long w1~istle of 8UTprz8e.) "Why,
how came you in this plight ?"
I told him.
"Well, I'm as glad as if I'd discovered the north-
west passage. Your father did me a kind turn when I
was a boy, and I've a chance now to pay him a small-
instalment. Hurrah !" 12

And he threw his hat high into the air, in a somewhat
Irish dernonstratioii of his eminent satisfaction.
"There's the lake; see it ?"
"Yes."
"And there's my house. You will stay there with
~ne to-night, of course."
"I can't possibly."
"Why?"
"Why, father is ill."
"Ah !~ tluia indeed? That alters the case. By-the-
by, will you oblige, me by handing this trifle to your
father ?"
"I thank you, sir. You can pay him when you visit
:Boylston."
"Hang it! how sharp you are! Have you got any
money ?"
"No."
"Well then, how do you propose to get across the
lake ?"
"I will be your debtor, so please you, for a shil-
ling."
".Yoi~'li take supper with the Great Mogul as much.
Here !"
And again he p~offe~ed me the notes.
"No, sir; only a shilling, if you please."
"You're, an obstinate cub. There's a dollar. If
you won't take that, you may swim the lake for me."
I laughed as I dismounted.
"That laugh's a good sign. I'll see you agt~in, ere
long. Good-bye. God bless you !"
And, with a hearty shake of the hand, he left me.
It was about four in the afternoon when I found' my-
self on the western shore of Lake Champlain, a little
to the south of Crown Point. I made my way to the
black, craggy mountain that rises at the head of Bull-
waggy Bay, (" Oh! the names that things take on!"),
bounded u~ its side, and, urging my way rapidly on-
ward, reached Port Henry at twilight. A night's rest
gave me new energy-and, as the sun rose the next

morning, I began my last day's travel. It was but
twenty-five miles-and though it was the Sabbath, I
hurried on towards home. The sun had just set 'as I
reached the brow of the hill from which you descend as
you approach Boylston from the south. J~ leaving the
highway, I walked slowly along in the thicket that
crested the Ledge, (it is cut down now,) until I was op-
posite the hQme of Jessie Grayson. In my "fulness
of heart," I knelt upon the green swatd, bared my tem-
pies to the cool west wind that swept down from the
mountains, and thanked God that I once more behehl
my native village. I arose, and Walked slowly home-
ward-when, suddenly, in a cluster of huge pines, IL
saw the gleam of a white dress. I heard the sound of
voices, as I drew nearer to the spot-and, as I ap-
proached still nearer, I heard, in tones that I could not
mistake, the words-
"Leave me, sir. It is not yet your privilege to corn-.
mand."
A tall form was just visible in a retreat through the
neighboring underwood. Whose it was I needed no
special revelation to inform me.
"Jessie !" saidJ, as she turned to go home..
"Dear Lynde! is it you ?" she exclaimed-and she
gave me both her hands. "Oh, I was so frightened!
I"
She stopped, suddenly.
"Where have you been, Mr. Weiss? When did you
return ?"
"Mr. Weiss ?" I echoed bitterly.
"Forgive me, Lynde. I know not what to say. You
would pity me, if you knew all."
"All, Jessie? What is it ?"
"I have promised to tell no one."
"But you can explain all by-and4iy ?"
She shook her head.
"it is time I was at home, Lynde. ])o net think
hardly of me."
"Think hardly of you? Do you still reject n~e?"

"I must."
"Then you love me, Jessie.' You"-
"When Miss Grayson requires your special attention,
sir," said some one at my elbow," we will very grate-
fully avail ourselves of your kind' assistance. At the
present time, you will excuse me for saying that she is
not in need of your services."
"Father !" exclaimed Jessie, reproachfully.
"Come, my daughter. It is time you were in-doors.
I hoped that your knowledge of this young man's pro-
fligacy' '--
"Profligacy, Mr. Gr~yson? Profligacy, did you say?
How, and when, and where ?"
"I did say profligacy, sir; and I beg to~ add that I
meant it. Good-bye, sir I"
I heard a stifled sob, as they left me; and I sank
wearily down upon the earth, heart-sick, despairing--
as one bereaved. I remained there-I know not how
long-until a thought of my father nerved me with new
energy. I rose hastily and strode homeward.
At the northern extremity of the Ledge was an enor-
mous pine. Next the path, it had the appearance of
being seund; but the northern side ~of it had been so
much burned as to leave a large cavity, still black and
charred, as it had been for years. As I passed it, a
slight rustle in the leaves arrested my attention. I
turned, but saw nothing; and thinking that it was the
wind stirring the dry leaves, I paused a moment and
looked over the village. It was, as far as I could see,
unchanged. It was now quite dark, and thelights were
gleaming che~rful1y from many a remembered window.
"Oh, my father! is it thus I come home to you?"
said I aloud; "in rags, penniless; you wellnigh as
poor, spirit-broken, ill? Pshaw! This is mere boyish
whining. There are no difficulties in your path which

"DEan !" hissed a voice fiercely in nay ear. A
sharp, burning; stinging sensation caused me to put my
hand to my side, as I turned to discover the. persoti
whose footsteps I heard in the underwood, and the warm
blood gushed forth from the wound. I remember' &amp;
feeling of dizziness and nausea, and a rnomentar~ sens6
of pain, as I fell upon some l6ose stones at the foot of the
pine. The assassin had done his work with some skill.
CHAPTER XXJJ.
~iLOME, AS I FOUND IT-A VISIT TO PAULA WARREN-THE
CIRCLE BROKEN.
I hAVE a dim recollection, as of a dream which I can
but half recall,. in the bustle, of the day's toil, of a dark-
ened room; of white, fringed curtains; the form and
proportions of which evaded my efforts to define them;
now distinct and natural, and then vague, shadowy, im-
palpable. I remember closing my eyes with a sigh of
exhaustion at the fruitless effort. I remember hearing
my name pronounced by a familiar voice ~ and after
that is another chaos. When my consciousness was
again restored, I remember feeling an accession of
strength. I could see nabre distinctly. I raised my
hands, and looked at them.. And them I asked myself
where I was, and how I came to be' in that particular
room. Turning my head, I saw, hanging against the
wail, a barQmeter and an 'old military chapean; one
F   of which articles I recognized as my father's; the other
as my brother Griffith's. The key was found, and I
soon recalled the incidents of my return to Boylston.
On a light stand, b.y the bedside, were divers cups and
phials; and among them was an ancient-looking silver-
12*.

bowed pair of spectacles, with a much-faded crimson-
morocco case, which I at once remembered as the pro-
perty of my aunt. I was wondering why I had been
left 'alone; and was about to make an effort to call some.
one of the family, (it would have been fruitless,) when I
heard a light footstep at my bedside. Oh, how my pulse
leaped as I turned my eyes! There, pale, sad-ill, to
all appearance-stood the idol of my life-long worship.
Lying, as I did, in deep shadow, she did not discover
that I had opened my eyes. She looked down upon
the phials and cups that covered the light stand, and
sighed.
"Jessie !" I said, in a hoarse whisper.
"Lynde! do you know me ?" she exclaimed.
"How long"-
"Hist! not a word! The doctor says you must not
attempt to talk. Thank God! he's saved !" she mur-
inured; and, bowing her head, she wept. A moment
afterward she left me. She returned with my father,
Griffiths, and my sisters.
"My dear boy !". murmured my father. "God bless
you! You have had a narrow escape. There, don't
try to say any thing.. Keep perfectly quiet, and we'll
have you up in a few days."
My aunt Caroline, Ann West, and my uncle Hugh
came in as h~e enjoiiwd me to bequiet; and as I looked,
in almost infantile weakness, at the familiar faces, there
were tears answering the hysteric flow of my own.,
"Leave him now," said my father. "Brother Hugh
wilL sit with 'him awhile, until Dr. Blair returns.
They left me. Wearied by even so slight an exertion,
I again sank into a profound slumber. When I awoke
again, the doctor was at my bedside, and near~ him
stood the clergyman, Allan Grayson.
~"Getting stronger, you -see," said tJ~e doctor to his
companion. -'
"Oh, decidedly," was the reply.'
"Well, Lynde, you have had a~ pretty sick time of it.
You're doing nicely, I see. Let me caution you to be

quiet. Don't speak to an~oc1~,', for a day or two yet.
II suppose you are lonely; tired, eli ?"
Nodded.
"Well, Griffiths may read Robinson Crusoe to you.
Here's Lucy and Jessie, though; we'll press them into
service. Here, Jessie! read this forlorn young gentle-
man a full, true, and particular account of Robinson
Crusoe's sickness, and his grand tobacco panacea.
Come, friend Grayson, the ladies are the best nurses,
you know. Here comes Kate; and, if the three can't
cure him, he's beyond my skill. Ha! ha! ha! Don't
have the dumps, my boy! You won't die, this time !"
And the gentlemen left me. With the gentle. minis-
trations of home, I recovered apace; and in a week I'
was able to sit in my father's arm-chair. Paul Warren
and his family were among my first visitors. My old
playfellows and neighbours came in as soon as the
medical ta6oo was removed; and their friendly sympa~
thy removed the unpleasant thoughts of my unexpected
arrival and my 'penniless condition.
My uncle Hugh relieved me one day of a burthensome
anxiety, by quietly telling me that my father's~ creditors,
on a careful examination of his affairs, were so well
pleased with his upright dealing, and so thoroughly
satisfied of his ability to pay all he owed, that they had
given him "an extension." The price of iron and lum-
ber, he added, had recently risen with a rapidity and
to an~ extent almost without precedent, and my father
did not, at that moment, owe five hundred dollars. The
rise in the value of real estate had been very consider..
able;' and his property, real and personal, would com-
mand fifty thousand dollars.
At last, after an interval of some' three weeks, I could
walk. With my father and my. uncle Hugh, or ~with
Griffiths and my sisters,-occasionally with the house-
keeper and Jessie 'Grayson.-.J strolled languidly through
the garden and into the fields. On one occasion, as we
were passing Fogg &amp; Gibson's store, Barney Fogg
rushed to my side.

"Hallo! Lynde! Got out ag'in, eh? 'Pon my
word, I thought you'd a-died. Who do you 'spose it was
that struck ye ?"
Griffiths: checked the. flow of Mr. Barney Fogg's short
sentences, and we walked home.
"Do you know who struck you, Lynde ?" asked
Griffiths.
"No."
"But you suspect."
"We'll talk of that by-and-by, Griffiths."
The recollection of this conversation was speedily
banished by the occurrences of* the next few weeks. I
now remember---what I did not then notice---that no al-
lusion was made to the occurrences connected with my
return. Besides, there was a great deal to absorb my
attention from day to day. I had no sooner recovered
than I re~risited my home among the mountains. The
lapse of a year~ and a half, though its effects were not
noticeable in Pauk and Mary Warren, had effected a
decided change in Charles, who was one of the lustiest
and most active among my father's lumbermen, and in
young P~aul, who, by dint of persevering study, had
succeeded in passing a very creditable examination at
a neighboring college, and was then winning golden
opinions from the faculty and the students. It was on
the very day of my visit that his mother had received a
letter from him. She had scarcely ended her eager
inquiries as to my fortunes during my absence, when,
with .a mother's joy swelling her heart and speaking in
her eloquent eye, she placed it in my hand, with the
simple announcement-
"From Paul." -
I opened it, and. read as follows:
"M-, December 21st, 18-.
"My DEAR MOTHER :-I shall be with you at Christ-
nias. The days are dragging their length very tediously
away, as you may well imagine, but the day after to-

morrow will set me free, and then, dear mother, I shall
soon be with you. Rejoice with me. Although I am
the, youngest of' my class, I have been elected to the
censorship of the literary society to which I belong. I
am so fortunate, too, as. to have pleased the president
and faculty, and they speak-somewhat vaguely, to be
sure, but definitely enough to set my heart bounding
like that of a thorough-bred in a fox-hunt---of good news
for me, which will not be very tardy in coming. Be-
sides, (and I say this because you will be glad of it,) the
little trifle I wrote in the summer vacation has received
the most flattering comments from the editor of -'s
Magazine, and it recently came to me in an English re-
print. Oh, if I can but succeed! dear, dear mother. I
thank God that I yet have a mother. How will I con-
jure up a spell that shall relieve grim poverty of her
long and unthanked sentinelship at your door? Do
you know, I am proud, and that I 8tep proudly when
I pass the starched and gloved, fashion-aping nonenti.

I long to do something; yet my better judgment says,

He arrived on the following day.. Decided as was
the change in himself arid Charles, I was surprised by
the greater alteration in the appearance of his sisters.

Ruth was now twenty, and was, as I soon learned, soon
to be married. Mary and Judith were like their elder
sister, fine-looking girls, nearly grown, and. great
favourites among the young folk at the Falls. Amidst
some idle badinage with Ruth about her approaching
nuptials, I noticed that a shade Qf unpleasant feeling
clouded the features of the mother, while Judith hung
her head with a deep blush. Paul happened to come in,
however, at that moment, from his work, and the inci-
dent was forgotten. The young student, too, arrived
that evening, and, in the joy of our greetings, I should
not probably have given the matter a second thought,
had not an occasional look of deep sadness and some
long-drawn sighs recalled it. I was at once satisfied
that Judith had given her heart's wealth away. To
whom, was a question for time to answer.
The Christmas holidays went merrily by, and, at the
urgent request of Paul Warren, I consented to prolong
my visit until after New-year's. ~oung Paul was then
to leave us, to take charge of a country school, and~
Charles was to return with hjs father ~to the Lumber-
men's Lodge. The da~ys went merrily by. The young
farmer tQ whom Ruth was betrothed came on the day
after Christmas, and, what with musie, dancing, and
sleigh-rides, there were few~dull moments for the happy
occupants of the cabin. New-year's came.
"You must excuse me this morning, Lynde," said
Paul, as we left the breakfast-table. "I've a few loads
of wood to haul to-day, and by-andby, if you have no-
thing better to do, why, cross the old rye~fleld, and
eome into the clearing where I am chopping. 12 shall
commence hauling in time to get home with a load of
wood at dinner-time. Good morning !"
"Good morning, Paul," I replied; and, as he turned
away with his ch&amp;~erfuI sTmile, his eyes flashing with
good4humour and beaming with kindness, his hearty
ringing tones falling welcomely upon other ears be-
sides~ my own, I sighed, as I silently asked myself if

LYNDE WEISS.               143
I too should, ever have such a home, with such an
angel-wife to gladden it with heaven's own joy and
peace.
The morning wore away. Charles accompanied John
Williams, the young farmer, to the Falls, while I sallied
forth with- young Paul through the snow towards the
clearing.
"Father must be loading," said Paul, as we left the
rye-field a~d entered the narrow thicket that separated
it from the place to which we were going. "I don't
hear the axe. It seems early, though, for him to begin
hauling."
We soon came in sight of the cattle. They were
standing quietly beside a large pile of wood.
"Your father has gone to the brook for water, pos-
~ibly," I remarked, as we approached the sleds "No,
here he is! He is hurt, Paul."
We both sprang forward. There, stretched at full
length, face downward, in the deep snow, lay Paul
Warren.
"Paul!" Iexclaimed, as I grasped the collar of his
coat, and attempted to raise him.
"Father!" screamed my companion, hoarsely. There
was no reply, no motion. The limbs were~ stiff. Th~
face was ghastly, and the eyes set. He was DEAD! He
lay as he fell. There was not a vestige of the slightest
struggle. We knelt in the snoW beside him. We chafed
his hands and temples. We loosened his clothing, and
rubbed the broad chest with snow. We be~ught him
to speak, to. give some sign. Alas! alas! Wo to the*
widow and orphans-he was dead!.

"the severe afliictio'ns" of which he speaks. To such
purpose did I strive, when the first violence of grief
was chastened, to give such poor woi~ds of condolence
as I could command to the stricken mother. But the
circle was broken. The chair was vacant. The cheer-
ful smile no longer enlivened the board; the well-
remembered voice rang no longer at the hearth. The
dust gathered on the favourite books. The spinning-

wheel was ~siIent. The necessary household duties were
silently performed. Now and then the mother and her
children leaned their heads mournfully together, bitt
the tears fell in* silence, and were stealthily ~wiped
away.
I remained for some weeks at the cabin. Just before
my return to the village, my father had dismissed his
clerk, at his own request, and Charles Warren was in-
stalled in his place. This was a most fortunate occur-
rence, as it served to divert the widow's thoughts from
the all-absorbing subject of her great and irr~p~rab1e
loss. Paul was successful in his school, and the friends
of the family found means to relieve them from all
fears of pecuniary embarrassment. A short time after
I returned home, the family removed to the Falls. By
a little exertion on the ~part of his friends, the appoint-
ment of postmaster was obtained for Charles Warren;
and thus, for the time, all was well.
I was, more than once, urged to reveal the partieu-
lars of the attack upon me; but, feeling that I could
not swear positively to the commission of the act by
Dodge, I refused to do so. My recollection was, of
course, imperfect ~ and, besides the want of positive
testimony, the circumstantial evidence was by far too
meagre to convict a man on so grave an accusation'
Oh, how tediously that long winter wore away I I
saw Jessie but seldom, and never alone. Dr. Dodge
had become an inmate of the family, and 'it was cur-
rently reported that the marriage would take place in

however, that there was 'no zest in any of my ~leasnres.

my room. With a profound bow and a most deferen-
tial scrape of the foot, he announced his mission. with-..
"Mistlier Lynde, honey, yer sister Lucy'll be

"Where is she, Jerry ?"
"In the gairdhin jist."
"Very well, Jerry."
I met both my sisters near a little nursery of peach-
trees, which had been the object of our especial care,
and which promised to bear fruit in the course of time.
"Why, Lynde !" exclaimed Lucy, with a very good-
natured frown, "you're as slow us the peach~trees.

"Possibly five' minutes."

"' Where. are Madam Grayson and Jessie?" asked
Lucy.

CHAPTER XXIV.
AN AYPAIX WITH TH~ LUMDERMEN~
MONTHS passed.~' Spring had come again. It was
late in March. The snow was incIting rapidly, ~nd th~
lumbermen were looking for the breaking up of the ice. -
The timber for some fifty rafts lay upoz~ the banks ef
the Bouquet; ~nd the jolly old raftemen rubbed their

1han4~ in genuine glee, as they recounted their exploits
on the rapids, and looked forward to ~another trial of
their skill. There2 was half-a-score of young men who
had, that winter, escaped the restraints of the school-
room, and they were looking forward to the perilous
descent of the rapids as the test which should give
them character and standing among the rude but
manly lumbermen, or overwhelm them with the dis-
grace of failure. There was, among the lumbermen,
an old crony of Paul Warren's, whom I had always
liked, (none the less because Paul lo~ d him,) and who
seemed equally attached to me. Lie was known as
Morris Farr.. He was a tall, ungainly, ~black-looking
personage-a jovial, hearty fellow; yet precisely the
sort of man whom you would prefer as a friend, and not
as an enemy. . I met Morris one day, after the ice had
broken up, as I was hunting with Munch near the
Lumbermen's Lodge, and he gave me his usual hearty
greeting.
"Hallo! Lynde, my 'boy! ' Thought I was never
goin' to see ye no more! Why ha'n',t yot~. hen to see
us?"
"I hardly know, Morris.~ I"-
"You don't know. Well, I do."
"Hardly."
"Then my name's not Morris Farr. Come closer,"
added he, in a whisper, and he looked very cautiously
around him. "You love Jessie Grayson !"
I know~~not why, but the expression felk gratingly
upon my ear, and I was angry with the man for his
abrupt remark.
"If I do," I replied, somewhat tartly, "I do not
choose to have my private affairs meddled with by any-
bod~%~ don't, eh ?" replied the himbe~man, a little
nettled) as' well, he might be, by so rude an answer to a
remark Which . h4 had made in all kindness. "Wa1,

hold ye !" added he, and, as he spoke, Charks Warren
and. Doctor Dodge approached us.
"You Can try your hand at measuring, me, if you
so choose," said I, angrily, not heeding the approach
of the doctor and his companion.
"Why, Lynde! you and Morris Farr are too good
friends to quarrel. What are you doing, with that
gun ?"
"I have been hunting all day."
"Well, come, Farr, make up. I thought Lynde
was your best friend. Shake hands and make up."
"I flatter myself that Morris Farr and myself are
competent to settle our own difficulties."
"Oh, well, if he's so touchy, let us leave him," said
Doctor Dodge, and they walked on towards the Lodge.
"I know that 'ere Dodge," said Norris.
"I think it quite likely," said I abruptly, and I
stalked away into the woods.
An hour's walk ~nd a few shots calmed my ruffled
temper, and I turned towards the place where I had
met him, for the purpose of asking his pardon. As I
did not care for further sporting, I left my gun un-
loaded. Munch went bounding along before me-now
following some tracl~ upon the surface of the snow-
now gambolling about my feet~ to my no small annoy-
ance, in a style that had more than once. welinigh sent
me headlong. I followed the river's bank until I was
opposite the, place where~ Farr had been chopping.
There I found a small raft, confined to the bushes on
the bank by a single withe. The fastening seemed in-,
secure, and I was about to~ adjust it when I heard the
report of a gun. I sprang hastily up the bank, think.
ing that Chai~les Warren, or his comparison, might have
started a deer, and made my way in the direction of
the report. I observed that the peal of Morris parr's
axe. had ceased, and hurried forward towards the .place
where I had left him. A sad sight aWaited me. . At
the foQt of a huge. pine,,, which 'he had nearly cut
through, lay the stalwaii~ lumberman, and from a small,~'

but unsightly wound in his' temple, the blood wa~
trickling down upon the snow. 2Re was stiR' warm,
and, laying i~y hand upon his breast, I thought I could
detect a feeble pulsation. Laying down my gun, I
tried to staunch the wound, although, from itS position
I thought it scarcely p~ssiblo to save him. lli~ dinner-
basket was near him, and along with it a pitcher, such
as the lumbermen were accustomed to use for bringing
water from the river. Seizing this, I ran to the bank,
and leaped upon the raft to fill the pitcher. My mo-
mentum, it seenis, loosened the already frail fastening,
for when I turned to 'juuip ashore, the furious current
had swept the raft at least ten feet from the bank into
the boiling current. Throwing the pitcher into the
water, I grasped, instinctively, a setting-pole, which,
fortunately for me, lay upon the raft, and, for a few
minutes, every thought was absorbed by my perilous
situation. For a considerable distance there were no
very abrupt turns in the river's channel, and there was
little dt~nger, provided I could regain the shore before
the raft should reach the rapids. I strained every
nerve to guide it to the nearest point; 'but the river
was swollen to a great height-the setting-pole was un-
~wieldy-~---the current was very strong-and, in utter
despair, I passed the point. There was yet another
chanc~ for me. A little below the point was an eddy,
into which there wa~ a possibility that I might guide
the raft. If I failed, there wals 'but the perilous alter~
native of leaping into the boiling, current and attempt-
'ing to swim to the shore. Exerting all my strength, I
succeeded in gaining the eddy. A loud shout greeted
x~iy ear as I approached the shore.
"Hallo! Lynde, is that~ you ?"~ exclaimed Barney
Fogg as I. leaped ashore. Beside him stood Frank
Gibson.
"W~ thought it ~was all day with you, Lyn&amp;," said
the latter. "You have had a narrow escape. Why,
you've hurt yo~.irself. Where does' this hlood come

from? Your hands are both bloody !-and this sleeve,
and your vest I"
I shuddered as I thought of m~' gun, left by the
body, and of the, Possibility that my bloody appearance,
together with, the fact of its being. found there, might
direct suspicion to me. Confused for the moment, I
replied-.
"I-i--Morris Farr is killed 1"
"Morris Farr!. Killed ?"
"Yes-that is, I believe he is not quite dead."
"Blow did it happen ?"
"211 cannot tell. Will one of you go for Dr. Blair,
while I return to the shanties ?"
"I'll go," replied Frank Gibson,. hastily; "and
maybe the constable wouldn't be amiss. Eh, Lynde?
You are looking pale to-day."
And he bounded away towards the Falls. Leaving
the bank of the river, I led the way for my companion
to a narrow lumber-road, along which we urged our
way at a rapid pace towards the Lodge. As we ap~
preached the body, we heard the sound of voices, and I
shuddered as I heard Charles Warren say-
"Oh, I am certain of it. I know his gun as well as 211
do my own."
" Had a bit of a quarrel, you say ?"
"Both were in evident ill-temper," replied DoctQr
Dodge. "Ah! here he is, boys!" he added, as '1i~ saw
me approaching. "The blood isn't dry on him."
"Is he alive ?" I asked, almost breathless with my
walk.
"As dead as his axe !" answered one of the blmber0
men, with a scowl. "Better for you, I'm thinking , ef he
W~8 alive. Killed the best feller in the settlement,
since Paul Warren died. Shouldn't wonder ef you hed
a hand in that."
"Liar !" I retorted, and* I levelled &amp; blow at him
which would have felled him to the ground had not
some one caught my arm*.
"So! ~o-o-Q !" hissed the fellow through hi~ teeth,

What d'ye say, boys, don't he deserve stringing' up for

"That. he does! Yes! Jest right f~r him !" sho~ited
some of the men, and; several other lumbermen coming
up, the vote was taken again.
"This won't do, boys," said Charles Warren. "Give
him his trial. The court sits tl~e first Monday in next
month."
"So I say," added Doctor Dodge; "Fair play.
Give the devil his due."
"Who ari you ?"' replied Saxton. "Jest rein in yer
houses, or we'll string you up, too! Ef it hadn't ben
for you, he'd ben better off. S~o jest shut up, or you'll

"For God's sake, Sam, you're not in earnest !" ex-

"Stand off! Let me go! Men! will you hear me?

"Never mind the butt. Freeze to him, boys 1 Hold

He was obeyed. With his own hands he put the

CHAPTER XXV.
A WEEK IN~ JAIL.-THE TRIAL.
OH that week in prison! I would not pass another
such for years of life. True, I was allowed the use of
books and paper. My father, my uncle Hugh, and my
aunt Caroline, Grifliths, and my sisters visited me-as
did many others. I was supplied with every imaginable
comfort, and was partially reconciled to my confinement
by the assurance that few, if any, thought me capable
of the commission of such a deed as was laid to my
charge.~ Counsellor S-.~--, whom my father had em-
ployed as leading counsel, visited me, and heard my
detailed statement of facts. Kate whispered in my ear
a kind message from the parsonage. Yet, notwith-
standing all this, I passed the week in agony. I could
not read, or write, or think. I could not rest. I have
no words-nay, there are no words-that can ade-
quately express my wretchedness. Not merely that I
was charged with the comi4~ion of a foul crime; not
that my defence seemed almost hopeless; not that I
was, in all' probability, to die a dog's death by the hang-
man; but that I was fettered. Against the probable
result of the trial I could nerve myself; but the being
chained, like a sheep-slaying cur-oh, that was what
goaded me to madness. The snow melted from the
earth. The mild air of spring came in nt my grated
window. I could hear the robin's song at daybreak, and
I strode angrily, in my clanking fetters, to and' fro in
my cell,-4' have lain for weeks upon the couch of sick-
ness. I have been confined for weary' days and nights
to a narrow berth in a ship's forecastle; but, in all my
life, I remember nothing that so ~gnawed at my very
life-strings as that week's confinement in jail.

LY2~DE WEIS0.              157
It wore away, and at length came the' day appointed
for the trial. It was about nine o'clock that I was con~
ducted by the sheriff to the court-house. There was an
immense concourse of people around the jail. They'
were gathered in knots and engaged in eager conversa-
tion.
"Here he comes !'~' said somebody, as. I left the yard
of the jail; and, instantly, all eyes were turned upon
me. The crowd approached as near to me as the guard
would permit, and I heard not a. few declaring their
belief in my innocence.
"Keep up good heart, Lynde !" said Paul Warren,
who, it seemed, had come home to attend the trial; and
the words provoked a murmur of approbation in the
crowd,
"Chip o' the old block !" said one.
"Ay, that he is. What 'd old. Paul a' said to the
like o' this ?" said another.
As I entered the' court-house~ I turned to .catch the
eye of the young student; when, directly ~ehind him,.
I met the glance ~of Dr. Dodge bent upon me, wiA~h a
smile of malignant satisfaction., lit was but for an in.
stant. We passed on, and I was placed in. the dock. I
looked around me; and as I found every eye bent upon
me, a sense of my own innocence and of the wrong
abQut to be done me~ gave me the ~air of proud defiance
as I looked arou~ui me. The tedious empanneling of
the jury was at last got through with, and the indict~
went read,
"What say you, Lynde Weiss ?" asked the clerk,
"are you guilty, or not guilty ?"
"Not guilty !" I answered.
"Are you ready, gentlemen?" asked~ the district &amp;t~'
torney.
"We are, sir," replied Counsellor $-.; and the
former addressed the jury.
He began with some general remarks about their re~
sponsibility, 'in the trial of an offence involving the
reputation and liberty-perhaps the life-of the pri-

sorter. He reminded them that the court would in-
struct them to givo the ac~ised the benefit of any
rational doubt of his guilt. "But, gentlemen," he s~id
in conclusion, "while you must not suffer yourselves to
be prejudiced against the prisoner, it is my duty to
caution you not to suffer your previous acquaintan~o
with him, or your previous regard for him, to interfere
with your solemn duty. We will now proceed with the
evidence.. Samuel Saxton !"
"Samuel Saxton I" repeated the sheriff.
"Here 1"
"Takethe stand."
"Now, Mr. Sexton," said Mr. Harper, the common-
wealth's attorney, when the witness had been sworn,
"tell the jury what you know of this affair."
The witness stated, in a surly, dogged tone, that, on
the day of the murder, Morris Parr had been ordered
to fell a large pine; that he went directly to the place
and began the task; that about two o'clock, he heard
several sh~s, and the barking of a dog; tha~t he paid
no attention to it; that a few minutes after this, Charles
Warren and Dr. Dodge came to the Lodge, with their
dogs and guns, and that he invited them in to drink with
him; that they Aid so; that immediately afterward, on
leaving the Lodge, the dogs struck each a different trail,
and that Charles Warren said to the doctor, "Dodge,
you follow that trail, and I'll follow thi8 ~ that they both
disappeared in ~the woods; that, some twenty minutes
later, he heard a single shot; immediately after which
they returned, beth' at the same time, in the same direc-
tions in which they left him; that', he heard Doctor L~odge
say, "Come, Warren, this is dull sport; let us go home ;"
that. he;started with them from the Lodge, on their way
homeward, to see how Parr was getting along; that
th~yifound him . lying at the foot of' the pine, dead;
that the prisoner's gun lay beside him in the:snow, and
that there were fresh tracks both towards and from the
river.; that they followed the tracks to the bank, where

they could be traced no farther; ~but- saw no one, and
therefore returned to the.b~dy.
"Are you aware of' ahy ill-feeling between the de-
ceased and the prisoner ?"
"Why, I've hearn tell"-.
"Never mind what you have heard. Do you know
of any."
"No, sir; t~iey was always uncommon good friends,
fur as I knowed any thin' 'bout it."
"That will do. Mr. 8-, have you any questions
to ask the witness ?"
* "One or two, Mr. Harper. What were you doing
when Warren and Dodge found you at the Lodge ?"
"Mending a sled, sir ?"
"They went in different directions, you say ?"
"Yes;"
"And returned at the same time ?"
" es."
"Would the course taken by either of them- lead you
near the place where-Parr was chopping ?"
"It would. Doctor Dodge must have gone mighty
nigh in sight o' the spot."
Here there was a general turning of heads; but Doc-
tor Dodge 'was not in the court-room. -
"They returned, you say, in the same directions in
which they started ?"
"Yes."
"Did you see any thing peculiar in the manner of'
either' of those gentlemen ?" - -
"No, sir, I can't sa~ as I did; though I thought Doc-
tor Dodge seemed to be in consid'ble of a hurry to start -
for hum."
"Very well; you may go down." -
Charles Warren was then called. lie stated that, on
the day set forth in~ the indictment, he went to the
lumber settlement with Doctor. Dodge, with two dogs and
guns, for a few hours' sport; that they found Farr and
the prisoner in an altercation. . - -
"Some hard words ?"

"Not' very. ]?arr said, 'Don't get into a luncheon,
for a demijohn would hold ye,~ and the prisoner replied
'You can measure me if you choose."'
"You left them, then ~"
"Yes."
"Heard no more hard words ?"
"No,. sir."
* "Did you hear any threats Y" asked Mr. S.
"I did not. The prisoner said they could settle their
own difficulties."
"That will do."
"Doctor William Dodge !" called Mr. Harper.
"William Dodge !" echoed the sheriff.
"Here I" replied the witness; and he made his way
to the stand.
His testimony, as elicited by the prosecuting attorney,
was of the same tenor -as that of Warren, and he was
handed over to my' counsel.
"How long were you gone on the trail which you
followed 'from the Lodge?" asked Mr. S
"Possibly twenty minutes."
"Did you see Farr?"
"I did not."
The witness smiled, as' if ridiculing' the idea of his
beiPg suspected.
IL turned to the court.
"May I ask the witness a question, your honour ?"
"Certainly."
"Doctor Dodge, did you ever know Morris Farr, be-
fore you came to Boylston ?"
He turned pale for an instant, but answered firmly,
"Never."
Young Gibson and Barney Fogg were then called in
succession., and testified to the 'facts already known to
the reader. There was a murmur of satisfaction as they
stated IL had requested them to go for the doctor; bat;
this gave place to gloom and doubt when it was further
elicited that my manner was confused, and That my
hands, sleeves, and vest were bloody. The coat, vest,

~*nd gun were then produced and identified. The boots
that IL wore were produced, and several witnesses swore
to the exact correspondence of size with the tracks near
the body, and those going to and from the river. It
was further proved t~jat the pitcher belonging ti~ Furr
bad been found in the channel of the river, a short dis-
tance below the Lodge, but a day or~ two previous to
the trial.
Having got through with. the witnesses, the district
attorney arose and addressed the jury.~ 'He had under-
taken, he said, the discharge of an unpleasant duty, at
the opening of the case, with the hope-almost with the
belief, that the prisoner was innocent. Yet. so full, so
unbroken ~was the chain of testimony, that (however
painful it might be to him, as an old friend of the
prisoner's father,) he must say that there was no doubt
of his guilt. lit was proved that there were hard
words-that the parties 'were left together-that the
gun, the tracks, and the spots of blood had\ been sworn
to by unimpeachable witnesses. "I will not now say
more," added he; "we will see what the prisoners
counsel has to urge in his defence."
Counsellor S---... rose slowly, as if overwhelmed by
the weight of adverse testimony.
"May it please your honour and. the gentlemen of
the jury," he began, "I frankly confess to you that the
testimony against the prisoner at the bar is very
strong. Yet I say t~ you, in all sincerity, that I be-
heve him to be as guiltless of the murder of Morris
Parr as I cam. Let me beg you to bear in. mind that,

a boy's petulant reply. The circumstances which have
occurred during the last few months, and which, you
will pardon. me for saying, have had somewhat to do
with the prisoner's manifest depression of spirits, are
well known to you. . Educated from infancy, side by

father, who was then confined to his sick-chambe~. He
meets Miss Grayson on the 'Ledge, in sight of her
father's house. He zsees some one leaving her as he

senseless. Gentlemen !" exclaimed Mr~ S.-, raising
his voice till the court-room rang with it, "who struck
that cowardly blow?"
"No one knows," said the district attorney.

"Does he know ?" asked the court.

who else but Dodge could have struck the blow? He
never had an enemy at ]3oylston, and iDr. Blair~ells
us that the blow could not possibly have been struck
by himself."
"May it please your honour," interrupted the prose-

guilt have done that ?"
"No! Bless you! bless you, Mr. 5-! lIe is
innocent !" said Lucy, as, with streaming eyes, she
clasped the hand of the speaker.
"Order! Silence !" said the sheriff, mildly, but his
eyes, and hundreds more, were wet with tears.
"I believe she is right, gentlemen," resumed Mr.
S.-.--., when he had gently reseated' my sister. "But
there is one other point to which I beg you to give
heed, and which will show the court and my learned
friend over the way, that m~ remarks have not been so
irrelevaiit as they may have seemed. It is in evidence
that Dodge left Saxton, and went into the woods in a
direction which must have carried him nearly, if not
fully, in. sight of Parr. Now, I am not permitted to
show you that Parr had, a few moments before, de-
clared that he knew Dodge."
"Really, your honour," interposed the prosecuting
attorney, ~' I"--
"Well, let that 'passb But I may show, and I have
shown, that Dodge. was in' a very remarkable hurry to
get home. Who is this Dodge? 'Does anybody know?
Gentlemen, I must close. I confess that I cannot give
you positive proof of the prisoner's innocence, but can
you doubt it? I think not. There is no positive evi-
dence Qf guilt-no pretence of previous malice-no
proof whatever of any adequate cause for' the murder.
If you have any doi~bts of his guilt, gentlemen, bear it
well in mind that you cannot bring him in guilty. The
attorney, for the commonwealth has~reminded you of
your duty in bringing in a verdict according to the
'evidence. And what is the evidence? Wo34d any one

frail a thread? 'Is one man to be hung merely because
you do not know whom else you shall suspect! Oh, no,
gentlemen! You are too intelligent, too manly, too
christianized, to do so merciless an act of injustice.
Admit for a moment that, in a paroxysm of passion,
the, prisoner had committed the crime. It were. then
but homicide, and his life, at least, were safe. 'But
will' you even deprive him of liberty on so frail a tissue
of evidence? I cannot believe it. No, gentlemen,
even where there is "positive proof of' guilt, justice is
not a soulless stock-a mere Juggernaut, underneath
whose ruthless wheels whosoever falls must be inevita-
bly crushed. You may admire the artist's conceit in
painting her blind; but she need not, therefore, be
deaf. If justice and punishment be synonymous, why,
then, be the reeking axe, and not the scales, her em-
blem. Let the lowly, self~righteous Pharisee, the~
ceremony-begotten, form-nurtured saints, whose 'fine
linen' ~is their 'righteousness,' say what they will.
Humanity and religion' say that the deed alone shall
not constitute the crime. T-he scales were, else, as well
the ghastly gibbet, stationary, senseless, merciless; as
nell' the guillotine, that never moves but at the behest
of death. Justice! She weeps' scalding tears over the
deeds done in her name. Why, gentlemen, Mercy held
her arm when-if the popular orthodoxy he~ true-she
would have sent earth's quivering millions to a hope-
less eternity of agony. Mercy is the right even of
the guilty; how much mere his right whose guilt you
can but surmise.

He took his seat, and the district attorney rose in
reply. He began by saying that he must acknowledge
that his friend 5- 'had never more eloquently ad~
dressed a jury in behalf of a prisoner. How good a
compliment he had paid the jury, on the present occa~
sion, by appealing to their feelings, instead of their
judgments, he left for themselves to decide. Were his
own feelings to bring in the verdict, the prisoner should
go free, for it was no case of hardened crime. But he
and they were there t? uphold the law-to discharge
duties upon oath-to give in a verdict according to the
evidence, and not in accordance with their feelings.
He then reviewed the testimony, and sat down.
The judge charged the jury to the effect that if they
had any reasonable doubt--and this he took care to
define very carefully-they were to 'give the prisoner
the benefit0 of it; and with some feeling remarks on the
solemn responsibility under which they rested, he closed
'his remarks.
Oh, what terrible moments were those which suc-
ceeded! The jury retired, andl was remanded to my
cell. All access was denied to.~ me, and I paced the
stony floor in utter despair. To increase the gloom, of
my cell, a 'fierce storm came on, accompanied by the
first thunder that I had heard since the coming of
spring. The lightning hashed, sending its fierce glare
into my narrow iron.barred window, almost blinding
me with light, and then leaving me in rayless darkness.
It was welluigh day ere I slept.
At the opening of the court I was again ushered to
the dock. Some preliminary business was 'attended to,
and the clerk then said to the jury-
"Gentlemen of the jury, are you agreed ?"
"We are," replied the foreman.
"What do you say? Is the prisoner at the bar
guilty, or not guilty ?""
I remember hearing a loud shriek, and then a feel-

ing of dizziness came over me, as I heard th~ an-
nouncement. It could have been~ but momentary, for I
heard the sheriff exclaiming-.
"Silence in court !" in a* loud and authoritative
tone.

CHAPTER XXVI.
~
FoR a few days there. was a great deal of talk about
the trial. It was urged by some that Dodge should
be arrested and tried, while, others asked, "' To what
purpose ?" What new fact could be elicited? True,
it was proved that I was innocent; but where was there
any thing better than circumstantial evidence against
Dodge? The excitement wore away gradually, and, as
is usual in such cases, many took sides with the doctor
as an injured man-the more readily, since Allan
Grayson and his wife remained his staunch friends. He
was still an inmate of the parsonage, and it became a
settled understanding that ~his marriage with Jessie
Grayson would positively take 'place 'ere the moon
waned. So reliably, did this rumour come to me, that
I, at length, gave it credence, thinking that, with Jes-'
sie, pity had given place to a warmer feeling. Accord-
ingly I did~ not visit the parsonage. I resumed my
sports in the woods, and upon the river I refitted my
sloop. Paul Warren' remained a few days at home to
recruit his health, and we were ever together. In this
way it happened that I was scarcely ever at home.
~one of the family molested me, and .~ felt grateful for
their forbearance-the more so, as it seemed the tacit
reward for my abandoning a recent intention to go to
sea. I became a constant visitor at my foster-mother's,
and the former coolness wore away. There' was appa-
rently 'but ~one of the family who had i~ot, to some ex-
tent, recovered from the shock of the father's death-
and that' was Judith. I observed that she' became a
constant visitor at~ the parsonage, and that my sisters
scarcely ever went there; while both they and Griffiths,

LYND~ WEISS.               169
my father and my uncle Hugh, especially the latter,
became, every day, more attached to the widow .and~
her excellent family. I saDw,' too, with the keenest
pleasure, that Grifliths Was becoming ~very attentive to
Mary Warren, while Charleis Warren, to whom my
father was gradually resigning the entire management
of hi~ large and prosperous business,, was more than
suspected of making advances to my sister Lucy~ In~
this manner three weeks passed away. It was near
the last of April, and but a single week remained he~
fore the ~expected' wedding.~ I ~had persuaded' Paul to
remain at home until that time,' on the condition that'
half of our time should be devoted to study. ~One
evening-it was Thur~day, I remember---we were pass-
ing the inn, when a traveller rode leisurely 'to the door
on horseback. It so happened t1iat~: neither mine host

"'Oh, no," replied Paul, laughing. "I'll call th~

"You Jack Collins!' Jack Collins, .1 say!" shouted
the innkeeper.
"Comm', sir'," was the reply, and that functionar~.
speedily made his appearance. ' ''

"Not to my knowledge," I replied. "DQ you know

stranger, he became chatty and communicative. He
became very particular in his inquiries about Doctor
Dodge, and invited ihine host to take wine with us for
the purpose of. obtaining all possible information.
"If it's a fair question," said tholatter, whose ~curi-
osity was aroused by the stranger's queries, "why do
you inquire so particularly about Doctor Dodge~ Old

"Yes. Butyon seem to. know less about him than
Ido."
"Bless your heart, stranger, we don't know any
thing about him. He came here a little .more'n a year
ago, and stuck up his shingle as a doctor. He hadn't
done much in that line; but he lives well, and has
plenty ~ money.~~
"That he has, I'll be bound."
"How he gets it, no one knows."

"J3ut J shall get mine.
"How?"
"Maybe I'll tell you before I go. I'm tired and

The stranger retired, and we left the hotel.
~" Joy for iou, I~ynde," said Paul, grasping uiy
hand.
"Why?"
"Why? Can't you expose the villain, and save
Jessie Grayson ?"
"Would the Gr.aysons believe any thing to his dis-
advantage ?"
"But here is proof."
"Ay, the assertion of a somewhat shabbily-dressed

"But we can write."

"You're right, 'Lynde. Let's go nearer."
We did so. For a moment all was still, but,. a

"Yes. Speak softly. Come down-I want to see

"Yes, and I'm the. man to do it."

1~HE FOOT-DR!DG-~E~RIBUTION.

characterr 'of Doct~r Dodge, that eminently original
personage was requested 40 find other quarters. lie

with logs and drift-wood. 'Before noon~ the bri4ge,~wa~

which had been built for the convenience of) ~he *ork.
men at the forge, and which was but a few yar~s above
the dam. It. was huil-t somewhat in the ~mai~ner of ~a
suspension-bridge, being supported, by iron z'ods~ and it
was sufficiently strong for any ordinary'. purpose.. hi-
deed, it was thought to be amply strong to si~ppprt the
weight .of thirty or forty persons, though it was seldom
that mou~e than. two or three were ever ,seen Upon it, a4
the same time. The. workmen had been a little siiy of
it at first, but theK feeling wore away, and it came to be
considered as. safe, for its intended purpose, as the
more substantial h~idge above it.
It so happened that the annual town~-meeting, held
for the election of officers, and for, other matters per..
taming to the welfare of the little commonwealth, had
been appointed for that day, and,. as the. meeting was
to be held in the school-house, on the easterii~ bank. of
the river, a large portion of 'the residents (the' lumber-
men among them) were obliged ,to, ,make us~of4ie
little foot-bridge. Accordingly, during the early~.part
of the day, you couhi se~ little knots. of people pausing
on the bridge, asthey crossed, ~o look, upon the- swollen

"The Washington Inn" had provided most bountifully
for his~'guests, and what with the earlier potations of
the day, it was no great marvel that they grew noisy
and somewhat troublesome. The dinner, however,
passed without any serious disturbance. The politics
of 'the' day then engrossed the attention of the village
politicians, who disconrsed learnedly to the lumbermen
of State-rights and the tariff, democracy and federal-
ism-mtrch, it must be confessed, to their mystification.
As the afternoon wore away, the potations of the
throng'grew deeper and more frequent. Loud words
were now heard, and feeling 'confident that the usual
quantity of fighting was about to commence, by way of
vent 'to 'the ' excit~ixient of the occasion, I turned to
Paul and asked him' to accompany~me home.
' "Sha'~n~t we stay, Lynde, and see the opening of the
bear-garden ?" he said, laughing.
No7 go home with me."
"Well, y-ou'll.drink a glass of wine-with me
"Yes."
We stepped. to the barand were lifting our glasses,
when' Paul was 'very rudely interrupted by some one at
his elbow.
'"What d~ you. mean, sir ?" asked Doctor Dodge,
(for it was he.) "You knocked my tumbler out of my
hahdV'
"It was entirely accidental. 'Pardon me.
"Accidental, you say. Perhaps 50."
".Youcan take it as you please."~
"Then take 'that !" exclaimed he, and, quick as
lightning,"'he dealt ~Paul a blow that made him reel
against me. '.' My' arm was caught as I attempted to
punish the miscreant.
"Stop a ~inute, LyLide !" exclaimed Sam Saxton,
the lumberman. "I've a small account ~to settle with
this gentleman," and be laid 'his iron grasp upon his
victim's throat.
'"Ibid on, Sam ! ~Don't choke him! 1"ve a settle-

8ent~y~O make
men         with that feller," said' another, and pre~
the doctor was surrounded by some half a score
angry lumbermen. At this juncture one of them
shouted-
"Throw 'him off the bridge!"
"Right! right 1" exclaimed others. "Didn't he
stab Lynde?"
"And shoot Morris' Farr ?"
"And deceive the minister ?"
The trembling wretch was now hurried aw&amp;y towaids
the bridge. Knowing the certain doom that awaited
him, without some more powerful interference than 'I
could' command, I begged th~ innkeeper t&amp; run for
Allan GraysoD, while I hurried home to apprize my
father and Griffiths of what was going on. ,B~th had.
one to the forge. Despatchin~ Jerry for them, at the
op of his speed, I in'et the lumbermen at a short dis~
stance above, the bridge.
"Let him go, Sam," I said to Saxt~n. "You have
no proofs of his guilt, and you surely wouldn't kill an
innocent man I"
"Get out o' my way!"
" Remember how nearly you had murdere&amp;me."
"Yes, I do ; '~but this 'ere's a villain as don't deserve
to live."
"That is for the jury to sa~y, Sam."
"Boys, jest take Lynde away, will ye ?" said Sam,
~ho still retained his hold of Dodge.
"Here comes minister !" exclaimed one.
Before Allan GraysoA could reach the spot, the
lumbermen, to the 'i~umber, perhaps,' of twezity, had
dragged their victim upon the bridge, and when the
clergyman came; his remonstrances 'were unheeded
"There comeS Uncle 'George !" tried one of the
crowd, and; hearing this, the enragedd lumbermen were
lifting the struggling man to the railing ef' the -bridge.
My father 'had" already reached it. By; this time the
lumbermer~ 'had '-raised thefr victim W the top of th~

the bridge broke in the middLe, and fell .with a loud
plash into the river. The parts, of the bridge swung
patiently round, so that~ the ends were not more than
thirty feet from the shora.,. The 8hor.t. plazi~ks. which
composed. the footing of the bridge. fell from it and
floated away, and thus there was no way to reach the
three persons who were clinging to the extremity near-
est the eastern shore. As the bridge swung round,
we~..discoiered that I~odge was clinging ~to the iron
railing, while his body was under. the :surface of the
water. Sam Saxton was clinging to him, and to Sam
his crony Bill Ferguson. wa~ holding, by the skirt of

current, and the noble fellows were lost. One of them
had been noted for his piety, ~nd he sang, as he floated
awaythe air and words of a favouiite hymn.,
It was plain that t~odge was n&amp;w wellnigh exhausted.

For a long time, the villagers stood silently on the
shore, awe..stricke~n by the warning providence that. had
thus rebuked the attempt to mete ~ut justice t&amp; the
