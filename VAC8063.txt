CHAPTER L
In the morning twilight of the tenth da
of &amp;pril of the year eighteen hundred and
forty-six, Lopez Pecosta, an aged citizen of
Santiago, as he looked across the great
gulf toward the east, observed the dim out-
line of a ships hulk, floating within the
moutn of the river. Surprised at a sight so
unusual~ for at that day a vessel seldom en-
tered the channel, he picked up his walking
itick and trudged down the bank of the
stream, until he stood directly opposite.
Leaning forward upon his staff, which he
planted firmly on the ground foji support, he
raised his hand to the broad brim of his
hard felt hat, and p~illed it a little downward
to intercept ~he glimmering. After intently
gazing for a few moments, he was enabled to
make out a schooner oftwo or three hundred
tons burthen: but the darkness prevented
more particular observation.
~ot content wIth what. he could discern he
shifted the position of his hand, and placing
it behind his ear, bent to the segment of a
circle, endeavored to distinguish the conver-
sation of those on board. But the bustle
of the sailors, busily employed at some sort
of noisy labor, and the confusion of different
voices, several persons speaking at the same
moment, completely baffled his effoit. ~ever-
theless, he wee now and then able to ce.t~h a
word, more distinctly or loudly uttered than
Iii fellows, and became satisfied that the

language used, although he conki not under
stand its meaning, was English, and strongly
suspected that those on board were Amen'
cans.
This conclusion seemed to inspire the old
man with renewed vigor, for he instantly
raised himself from his leaning posture, and
stood firmly upon his own natural suppor-
ters. "Thank God!" he exclaimed, with a
gesture of reverence, "myprayer is answered.
Here is a way opened, and through it I shall
conduct to power the pride of his conntry~.
to power which he only ougnt w exercise
over a country which he alone can save from
destruction."
Having uttered these words, he walked
quickly aws~ toward the village; but after a
few paces, changing his intention, turned
again to the vessel, .which he hailed; as if he
would assure himself before he returned.
"Ahoy, ship I" he cried in the Spanish
tongue, hoping to attract the attention of
those on board, and to elicit an answer that
would quiet his doubts.
"Who calls, and for whatpurpose?" replied
the Captain of the vessel, In the same Ian.
guags.
On hearing this answer, the old man ez-
claimed with a great oath, "l)ecelved again,
again disappointed." And in the anger of
the moroes4, he gnashed his teeth and struck
the ground repeatedly with his cane, which
was split from the socket to the haft, and
rendered entirely useless.

"Doeshe know ivho we arc?" inquired the
state.
"No," replied Captaiu Leonard; "but as
oou as the sun dispels the twilight, he will
not only discover our true character, but de-
tect me in a falsehood."
"A falsehood!" repeated the mate, "Why,
what did you tell him?"
In reply, Captiiin Leonard rehearsed the
conversation that had passed between hini~
self avid Pecosta in the presence of Mr. WI!-
hams, who, like the rest of the crew, utider~
stood not a word of Spanish.
"And whether the curiosity of you old
Mexican is satisfied," he added in conclusion~
"depends entirely upon the degree of credit
he attaches to my story; but otir safety de-
pends, in a great measure, upon our own ex-
ertions; for as soon asit becomes known that
a vessel is in the river, the banks will be
covered with both male and female lenders
of almost every age, laden down ~with bread
and meat, and garden vegetables, wishing t~
traffic. I have traded a great deal among'
these people, and am well acquainted with
their customs."
"What course do you propose to follow?"
inquired Mr. Williams, who was beginning
to grow uneasy.
"In the first place," replied the skipper,
"the stars and stripes must be lowered, and
the flag of Buenos Ayres run up in their
stead. In the next pls\ce, we must throw a
tarpaulin over the barrels upon the upper
deck, and permit nothing to remain visible
that may be distinguished from the shore and
lead to our detection. And in thethirdjlace
if they come, as I believe they will, we must
trade with them on the shore, and endeavor
to engage their attention until the flood ena-
bles us to escape."
"But suppose they come in boats, as is
frequently the case at New Orleans and G~i.
veston with those who wish to sell or barter
vegetables?" suggested Mr. Williams.
~'We must immediately weigh anchorl' ~
plied the Captaib, "and pass out of the river
beyond the possibility of such intrusion.

TItlE RANGER'S REVENGE.'

There is space' enough between the bar and
the shore to ensure our safety, as the canoes
of these people would be swallowed up in
such billows as are now dashing against the
beach"
Turning to the sailors, who wore sitting
about in difi~etent places, spinning yarns for
the amusement of each other~ he cried, "UP,
my lads, and heaVe the anchor."
A portion' of t~ sailors, u~jder the direc-
ti~n of the second mate, pro~~ded to raise
the anchor, and the remaind~"~uided by Mr.
Williaiils, to unfurl a sail.
The noise of the capstan soon attracted
the notice of others of the inhabitants of Sai~
tiago, and before the labor was half done,
some fifteen or twei~ty had assembled on the
north shore opposite, near the spot where
Pecosta stood when he and the skipper were
engaged in conversation.
A few'minutesafter, Pecosta, gliding along
with ~e current in a li~ht canoe, approached
the b&amp;w of the' vess~I unperceived; for al-
thoi~gh the da~ had b~gun to' break, the ship -

"Captain," continued the Mexican, pull
ing his canoe alongside of the schooner, "I
am astOni5hCd to find Ton w~ighiing anchor at
a time when an attempt to go over the bar
will be certain destruction."'
"I do not intend to destroy my vessel by
the rash step you regard as the cons~qtience
of a necessary preparation," replied Captain
Leonard; I axil only getting ready te avail
myself of the flow, ~t6 clear the bar without

"But five hours must elapse before the
tide will be high enough to carry you over
in safety," returned PecOsta, "and meantime
if the anchor is taken up, your vessel will be

These last words were expressed with a
firmness that clearly evinced' his determina-
ilon and were followed by increased exertion,
which soon curried the little canoe beyond
vision of those on board the schooner.

In the.meanwhile the sailors, under the ex~

place themselves beyond the reach ofdanger.
Round and round they turned the capstan,
link by link they shortened the chain that
supported the anchor; but time progressed
as well as their labors. Much was yet to

l~d ai~d water. And the orb of day waa
b partially visible when Pecosta's oanoe,
shooting around a projecting angle in the
bank, appeared in full view in the stream.
"Heave away, lads," cried Captain Leon-
ard, to the men at the capstan. Then turn-
ing to his mate, he continued, "Mr. Wil-

some one with him, who, at thii~distance,
looks like a woman."
The descent of the canoe was like a streak
of light, so short a time~e~apsed from its first
appearance until it touched the side of the
schooner.
"I admire the promptness with which you
meet your business engagements," said Cap-
tain Leonard, with a flattering smile.
"But you must not infer from my expedi-
tion," replied the Mexican, quickly "that I
amoveranxioustodisposeo in vegetables.
I ~an find a ready sale for the~n Matamo,
ras; and art Point Isabel, which is occupied
by a detachment of Mexican soldiers, or at
Corpus Christi, which is the head quarters
of the Army of Occupation, they command
a price considerably beyond what you were
charged. But it is less trouble to. sell at
one's own door as it were, and I hurried lest
you would be beyond the mouth of the river,
when I should not like to venture my little
canoe, and whence you might have thought
it too much trouble to disphich a boat to
meet me at a point of safety."
"You think less of my honor than I do
myself," replied Captain Leonard. "Not
for one moment. should I have considered
the trouble against a breach of my engage-
ment. Besides" he added, glancing at the
young lady who occupied a seat in the stern
of the canoe, "a sunlight view of so sweet a
countenance would have amply rewarded
me for a greater venture, without the vege-
tables."
"This is my daughter," said Pecosta.
"But, sir, do not~ be surprised; a rose may
grow in a peasant's garden as welL as in a
lord's, and if it receives less culture, may
possess no less fragrance. Olinda is a dair~-
t~y thing, if she is uncultivated."
To which Captain Leonard replied~ raising
his Panama and bowing to the young lady,
who returned his salute with a slight incli-
nation of the head, "I shall feel myself highly
honored if you and your pretty daughter will
step aboard my vessel and taste glass of my
wine. It has travelled with me from France
the country of its manuta~ture, and is none
the worse for being unadulterated."
"it is very seldom I indulge in vinous be.

replied Pecosta. "As our pursuits are hum.
ble, our habits of life are simple and our diet
frugal."
"If the lady's rosy lips but touch the rosy
wine," returned the captain, "I shall be satis-
fled."
"Do not urge my darling," said the Mexi-.
can, "I shall drink enough for both father
and daughter."
"That will suffice," said Captain Leonard
with a smile, "if the daughter beats the father
company."
"To manifest their good will, it is far
from necessary that either should enter your
vessel," retukiied Pecosta; "nevertheless, that
you may not esteem me churlish, I will sht~re
with you the contents of your bottle in your
own cabin."
As soon as the second cargo of vegetables
was transferred from the canoe, a rope ladder
was thrown over the starboard side of the
schooner, and Pecosta received on board.
Olindawith her blushing face averted from
the rude gaze of the sailors retained her seat
in the stern of her father's little boat.
Captain Leonard received hiaguest with
out.~tretched hand, and conducted him to his
cabin. From a small closet hetook a bottle
of wine, and filling a brace of tumblers that
stood on the table, presented one to Pecosta.
The other he took in his own hand, and look-
ing steadfastly into the face of 'her father,
simply uttered the name of Olinda.
Pecosta returned the look with a tearfut
eye, and swallowed the contents of his tum-
bler at a single dranght, to indicate that his
daughter's happiness, compared with all
things else together, was as the flowing gob-
blet to the dregs that settle at the bottom.
Captain Leonard in the most courteous
manner, imitated the example of the affec-
tionate parent,. and immediately refilled the
glasses; but Pecosta decline~1 &amp;second indul-
gence, assuringg him that the large quantity
he had already imbibed, owing to his abste.

'"There are conditions in which a man is
unable to express his though~," returned
Captain Leonard.
"While reason controls the man, he can
control his tongue," replied Olinda.
"Wine will thicken a man's tongue before
it will muddy his brain," said the Captain.
'2~'ew men are so abstemious as my father."

"And suppose I have," returned Captain

"If the ft~ther has suffered treachery and

hope to fare better," said Olinda.
"But if he has snfl~red no injury?" persist
ted the Captain.
"Then my presence is not needed;" an~
swerved the maiden.
- Captain Leonard, not knowing how to
meet h~r objections, returiled to the cabin,
and repeated to Pecosta the language of his
daughter, a~d passed a suitable encomium
upon her for her quick-witted replies.
"I will not~ bid niy daughter come aboard

river till within a few yards of the bank,
where it was turned up the stream. As she
elided by those on the shore, she spoke a
few hasty words, which produced an instan-
taneous excitement, that in a few minutes
was visible to all on board. When she reach-
ed the projecting angle before mentioned,
she looked back on the schooner, and seeing
her father leaning on the gunwale with his
eyes bent on her, waived the paddle above
her head, and the next moment 'disappeared.
CHAPTER III.
N~w the necessity for increased exertion
on the part of the sailors was greatly enhan-
ed, for although the maiden was ignorant of
thetrue character of the vessel, yet she was
too well assured of the facCthat~er father
was therein a prisoner. From those on shore
there was obviously nothing to apprehend, for
beside a large quantity of vociferous talk,
there was rio evidence that the fact had come
to their knowledge. Captain Leonard was
unable to account for this inactivity, on any
other than the following hypothesis; It was
his opinion, which he expressed to Pecosta
at well as his crew, that they were made ac-
quainted with the intentions of the maiden,
who had gone to apprise some garrison ~
other body of soldiers, of her father's im-
prisonment, to procure their assistance to
effect his liberation.
"I am not at all surprised at the deport-
ment of those on shore," replied Pecosta,
when Captain Leonard inquired the cause
of their inactivity. "They have no interest
in my welfare, for I am a stranger among
them. I came hither from Texas, and they
regard me as a fugitive from justice.' They
m~y term your act a daring outrage or a
'villianous treachery, arid shower upon your
head curses innumerable, and yet j know
they secretly rejoice that I am here a pris-
oner."
"But the same cannot be said of your
daughter, who ha~ gone to summon the sol.
diers to her assistance?" said Cartain Leon-
and.
"You greatly mistake the chb:acter of my

darling," returned the Me~icari. "She is not
a heroine. On the contrary, she is timid as
a fawn, and starts 4 the approach ~of danger
as she fled from the presence of her father's
imprisoner."
"Answer me, and answer me truly, "said
Captain Leonard, with an air of authority,
"is there a Mexican garrison at Santiago?"
"There is none within the disputed territo-
ry," replied Pecosta, "except the small de-
tachment at Point Isabel, before men-
tioned."
"Only two weeks ago," returned Captain
Leonard, 'all the coast country lying between
the Rk Grande aiid the Nueces, was filled
with straggling bands of cavalry, belonging
to the regiments under the command of
Canales and Minon?"
"But since then." replied the Mexican,
"they have been collected together, and are
now at Matamoras waiting the arrival of
General Anista, who is entrusted with the
chief command."
During thisconversation, Pecosta leaned
upon the gunwale of the schooner, with his
eyes intently turned towards the north. But
his gaze did not escape the observation ~
Captain Leonard, who repeatedly looked in
the same direction, concluded, as he could
discern nothing unusual, that succor was ez~
pected from Point Isabel. 'Under the influ-
ence of this opinion he urged his men to still
.greater efforts, and expressed the confident
b~llef that themaiden had gone to summon
the Me~icansoldiery, mom whom they could.
expect nothing but robbery and death.
Stimulated to more vigorous exertion
by the increased apprehension, the seamen
soon brought the anchor home, and spread
the great three-cornered sail to catch the
gentle wind that was to bear them to a point
of safety.
When the prow of the vessel was turned
towards the gulf, the Mexican shifted his
position to the opposite side, and cur uued
to gaze toward the north. Again ~aptaiu
Leonard looked in the same direction, and al-
though nothing appeared to support the opin.
ion already mentioned, he was more firmly
convinced of its truth, as the singular' beha-
vior of the Mexican 'was otherwise iriexplicav

Is. ~ut as they were passing beyond the
eaci of danger, he regarded it as a matter
C small importance-scarcely worthy of con-
ideration.
"And is it the design of your govern~
ient," said he, resuming conversation with
costat, "to fight for the little strip of bar-
~n land lying between these rivers?"
"Most assuredly," answered the Mexican,
rith emphasis. "And it expects to blot out
is only evidences of title which the Amen-
ins have, with the blood of their mercenary
ddiers."
"You have a mistaken notion of our
tiny," returned Captain Leonard. "Our
~ldiers do not fight for money, but for the
orion of their country."
"Are those native Americans who Corn-
rise the 4.rmy of Occupation?" inquired
~costa. "I do not mean the officers, for
icy are of course, but the rank and file!"
"It must be confessed that many of those
e foreigners," replied the American; "but
military service is as much their vocation as
~rdening is yours, and they pursue it for
is same purpose-a livelihood."
"That is to say," returned the Mexican,
hey fight for money."'
"It is one thing," returned the Captain,
o engage in military pursuits as a busi-
iss, and quite another, as you very well
aow, to engage services for a particular oc-
isbn and consideration."
"Th~re is certainly a difference," said Fe-
)stalvith a sneer, "and there is also a dif-
rence between tweedle-dum and tweedle-
is.',
"It is of little consequence to our govern-
out," said Captain Leonard~ "whether a
idier be a native or a foreigner; success is
is groat desideratum."
"Yes," said Pecosta, with another look of
sdain, "and that will account for the great
umber of foreigners which are to be found in
ur army. Your government is too ambi-
)us to engage in a war of invasion and con-
uest without the hope of success, and in the
ssent case there is reason to believe that
us hope is based upon the prowess of her
risk soldiery."
"You cannot have abigher opinion of Irish

intrepidity than I already entertain," return-
ed Captain Leonard, "so that subject admits
of no discussion on the present occasion; of
American bravery I have only to eay, that
the history of the past furnishes abundant
proof of its superiority, and supercedes the
necessity of particularity."
"You have reason to vaunt," said Pecosta.
"Your arms have been many times victorious.
But as yet you have only met the aborigines
of the wilderness, whose wooden bows and
flint pointed arrows avail but little in a strife
where lead and steel are used against them;
and the English, who are only in&amp;imitabla
when they encounter the effeminate inhabit.
ante of the Eastern Hemisphere."
"You are not so young as to have never
heard, nor so old as to have forgotten, the
battle of San Jacinto, where General Lions.
ton, a native of America, with a small body
of American 'troops, met the flower of the
Mexican army, under the command of its
most distinguished Captain, and against a
very great odds obtained a most eounplet.i
victory, and made the General in chief of'the
discomlited army a prisoner of war. You
must have heard of that engagement?" said
Captain Leonard, with a smile of triumph.
A shade passed over the dark features eA~
Pecosta, but he made no reply. His eyes
were still turned in the direction before men-
tioned, but the shore, the chapperal, the trees
and the sky, were all that were visible;
For a moment Captain Leonard regarded
him with attention. He was of the medium
height, slender, and slightly stoop-shouldered..
His features, like his person, were meagre,
and his complexion a chesxu~t-brown. His
eyes were large, black of course, brilliant,
and very expressive. He was clad in a suit
of coarse gray cloth, and over his shoulders
his hand thrust through the centre, hung a
blanket of inferior quality, such as are usu-
ally worn by the poorer classes of that coun-
try.
But in the midst of his observation, Mr.
Williams claimed his attention. The vemel
had passed out of the river, and was rapidly
approaching the bar, which-it should have
been mentioned before-surrounds the gulf~
and greatly obstructs navigation. The depth

of water upon this bar is not the same in all
places; along the coast of Texas, and parti-
cularly in the region of Brazes Island, it
ri~s so near the surFa~ee aS t~o prevent the
passage of large vessels under any circum.
stances, and those of small dimensions except
at the flow of the tide; And in some places
it is much nearer the shore than in others, a
fi&amp;ct which note u'a&amp;equently'Ieads the nnskil-
ful navigator into difficulty.
It wa~ durii* the night that Captain
Leonard, riding upon the huge billows that
dashed against the beach passed over the
river, and he was totally ignoait of his pre..
cise situation. 'Besides, h~ Wa~ mit at all
certain that there was tnor6 wat~r than the
Mexican had represented while his vemel
was drawing nearly six feet. Under them
cireutnstances it became necessary to drop'
anchor, launch a boat, and rely' upon the in-
dications of the plumit.
Accordingly, the abchor ~as unloosed
from its fastenings and a boat lowered to the
water, and manned with sailors under the su-
perintendency of Mi'.' Williams, who mana-
ged the rudder, while another of the crew
cast the leadand noted the depth of the wa~
ter.
Almost inimedlately,'Pecosta left the plate
he had occupied during the vessel's descent,
and joined Captain Leonard; who stood at

old mail by the throat, aid hurling him is
the deck with great violence. Then calling
through his trumn~et, he ordered Mr. Wil.
iams to return to the vessel immediately.
By this time a company of musketeers,
some forty in number, appeared in'the dis.
tance, and in a few minutes after at the top
of their horse's speed, dashed down to the
very water's edge.
Here they formed themselves into a line,
and the officer in command detnanded of
Captain Le6nard, in a very peremptory
manner, an immediate liberation of his
cotifitryman, threatenfug the destruction of
both vessel'and' crew it' he refused. Captain
Leonard replied that as soon as his boat re.
turned he would comply with his req~test.
Hereupon Pecosta called to the commander
of the soldiers, to dispatch the citizens for
their canoes and come and take the vessel
which was an American transport, loaded
with provisions for the Army of Occapati9n.
I~~ accordance with the direction ol OS.

nothing to everything, compared with his
fear of the Mexicans.
Deserted by much the larger portion of
his crew, Captain Leonard turned ~o the re-
mainder, and said to them, that as they had
shipped with him to labor and ant to fight,
he would not control their movements in thin
emergency.
"Yet," be added, with energy and deter-
mination, "if bat one of you will remain, I
will fight till the last drop of blood oozes
from inyveins before I will surrender; but if
you prefer, you may follow the example of
your cowardly inesmates."
Very much to the surprise of Captain
Leonard, who hope~I to be able ~o defend his
vessel against the attack of the musketeers,
the remainder of the crew, regardless of the
shame attached to their ignominious flight;
immediately launched the other boat, jumped
aboard, an~d struck out toward the shore
which their terrified fellows had akeady~
reached, leaving him with none in the vessel
but the Mexican, and without the means of
escape.
The musketeers who were descending the
south bank of the river, observing the flight
of this portion of the crew, started in pursuit,
and running between them and the shore forc-
ed them out to sea. For nearly an hour their
little boat was visible, and then it entirely
disappeared and was never heard of after-
wards,
CHAPTER IV.
Meanwhile tl~e other pa~y, beaded by the
officer in command of the company, had ta~

tam Leonard a prisoner. Not a prisquer qf

Leonard, "tnat I could so tkr lose control of
my temper as to lift my hand against an old
man, and he a prisoner."
"~nough," said Pecosta; and he turned
about immediately and cried," Stand back,
men," waving his hands to the soldiers, who
were surprised at his interference, and
still more at his authoritative demeanour~
"By what right doyou interrupt our pl~a-
sures?" demanded the lieutenant drawing his
sword' over the head of the old man "Away,
thou scum of the republic, or I will sever
your hcad from your body, and give your
carcase to t~ie dogs."
"To you, Captain Jose Peron, I appeal for
clemency on behalf of this helpless prisoner,"
cried Pecosta, turning to the officer in com-
mand.
"Captain Peron," said the lieutenant,
"grant not this captive's llfe, lest we quar-
rel, for I say he shall die."
"First let me hear the reason for this re-
quest," said 'Captain Peron.. "It may be
such as will juetiI~y his preservation."
"Speak out, old man," said the lieutenant,
~nd let ue know what reason you can assign
f'r this unwarrantable 'piece of interfer-
.ace?" V
"I have a reason," replied Pecosta, with
a dignity of manner that abashed thelienten-
ant; "but it is only for the ears of Captain
J'erou."
"Mr. Muffles," said the commander, ad-
dressing his lieutenant, "yon will see that
no harm befalls this man in my absence."
He then joined Pecosta, who had drawn a
few paces apart that they might converse un-
heard.
"Who is that man who has dared to con.
trol our actions-to interrupt our pleasures?"
demanded the lieutenant of one of the citi-
zone.
"I don't how," replied the man addressed
"He tame here a few days ago, but~where
from Idon't know. He dresses like the peo-
ple of 8antiago, but he talks different. It Is
the general opinion that he isn't what he ap..
pears to be, but who he is I don't know."
"And I dent know," said the lieutenant,
"and, I don't care. One thing I do know;
ioweyer, that this nhnil shall die or Jose Fe-

l~IDE; OR,
ron shall never be a major." Drawing a line
upon the ground with his sword, as Pizarro
did on another occasion, lie added, "Those
of you who are id favor of the prisoner's
death will join the side of Pedro Muffles."
A ehort ~time before all the soldiers wore
intoxicated, and the nausea occasioned by
the sea had but partially sobered them. In
this half drunken condition, the anger of their
lieutenant found a ready ~sympathy in their
bosoms, and without an exception they cross-
ed over the line which he had drawn upon the
ground~and swore that mortal man should
not deprive them of their vengeance.
In the meanwhile the following conversa-
tion took place between Pecosta and Cap.
tam Peron.
"The time has at length come," said the
former, "when an act of mercy may discharge
a debt of gratitude. To preserve tbe life
you villains seek to destroy, will be an act of
justice that may subserve both our interests.
At least, nothing can be gained by his death.
"I am not insensible of my obligations to
you or unmindful of the many servicOs receiv-
ed at your hands," returned Captain Peron,
"but if Muffles is resolved upon that man's
death, I must submit to lose his influence,
without which I shall be defeated."
"The influence of Pedro Muffles might
have been essential to the election of Captain
Peron," replied Pecosta; "but Captain Pe.
ron the captor, stands in need of no such as-
sistance. His name will be trumpeted
throughout the republic. All men will speak
in his praise. flis enemies will not dare to
open their mouths."
"And suppose all these things should come
to pass, and they are a great deal more than
I expect, what difference can the preserva-
tion of this man's life produce?" inquired
th~ officer.
"tie is a citizen of the U~ States-.-the
greatest republic upon the face of the earth,
and the master of one of his government's

a4 prisoner, than it would the destruction
otyonder prize."
"I cannot perceive the importance of this
mnan'spreservation,"returned the officer. "The
prime is valuable, because both vessel and
cargo are useful; the former will increase our
navy, which is none too large, and the latter
will support our army, which is none too
well fed."
"But of what value is the prize compared
with the life of a human. being?" inquired
Pecosta.
"It Is worth a thousand such as this man's,"
replied the Captain.
"1 speak not of the life of an American
but of a Mexican," said Pecosta.
'1 cannot see what the life of a Mexican
haste do with the matter," returned Captain
Feron. "To preserve one of my country-
men, if he was a worthy man, I would save
or destroy a dozen such lives, and sacrifice
a score of such prizes."
"Very good," said Pecosta. "If General
Arista was a prisoner of war and in the
hands of the enemy, would a hundred such
prizes procure his liberation? Would a doz-
en such secure the freedom of the meanest
private in our ranks? And yet, this man
would be received in exchange for any com~
mon soldier, perhaps for any officer whose
rank was not above your own. Do you now
see the importanoet"
~'Viewing the matter in that light," said
the officer, "it is of some consequence; never-
theless, I will not anticipate such a contin-
gency."
"The fortunes of war," returned the elder,-
"is a proverbial expression, and like all' pro-
'verbs, its truth has been established by time
and experience. Ten years have not yet
elapsed since the flower of our army was de-
feated at San Francisco, and the commander
In chief made a prisoner. It was these very
people wh~ were then our conquerors; and
Arista may experience the fate of Santa An-
an"
"In this opinion we widely differ," saidthe
young man. "I believe we shall be conquer-
era, pd 'more than conquerors; you imagine
that Arista will be repulsed, and consequent-

ly disgraced, and that Santa &amp;nna will be
~recalled from his banishment and placed at
the head of the army."
"I do sincerely believe~that all these
things will occur," replied Pecosta. "And
if they should, all the officers who enter th~
field with the defeated general, will. share his
disgrace. If Ayista sinks in the estimation
of his co~rntry, Jose Peron will sink with
him, unless he is fortunate enough to secure
a broken mast to rest upon. If Santa An-
na is recalled, Lopez Pecosta will doff his
peasant'sgarbfor his counsel will then be re-
quired. And then, if the captorhas notst~ined
his hands with the blood c~f innocence, and
covered his memory with eternal infamythe
exiled secretary may do him a greater service
than Pedro Muffles and all his friends could
accomplish."
"Allow me to quote another proverb," re-
turned the officer. "A bird in the hand is
worth t*o in the bush. The certainty of a
majority is to be preferred to the merepossi-
bihity of a colonelship."
"But Irepeat," said Pecosta, impatiently.
'that if Arista should be-defeated, Captain
Peron will share his disgrace. As the eap-
tor of a valuable prize and the first prisoner
of war, his name will become notorious, and
if that prize and prisoner are surrendered
to the government without injury, his fame
will not exceed his country's praise. Send
this man to Arista in my charge. and there
will then be one at head quarters to urge your
claims."
"And suppose Anita should see through
your disguise?"~inquired the officer. "Your
life is a forfeit the moment you set foot upon
Mexican soil."
"I care not if it seals my doom," replied
Pecos)a. "I will no longer no a wandered.
I would rather have a grave in the land of
my birth, than a home in any I have visited.
I have been dispossessed, disfranchised, ban-
ished; I may yet be executed; but I must die
in my own country, If for that country I die
a sacrifice."
"I will do what I can," said the officer~
"You can do all I ask," returned Pecoata
Thus the conversatl~n ended, and the
twain retraced, their steps in silence. Cap.

THE RANGER'S REVENGE.             17

At first a lowering cloud gathered upon
*is brow, but it was quickly dispelled, and
with a sn~ile he thanked ~the captain- for his
firmness, which had kept him from the coin-
mission of crime, but begged as a favor, that
height be permitted, with a few chosen
men, to pursue those of t)~ crew who had
escaped.
Captain Peron, hoping ~..o conciliate, gran-
ted the request; after which he and Muffles
bad a short private conference, which resul-
ted in a satisfactory understanding. The lat-
tsr, with his party, immediately set out upon
their expedition, crossing the river in the
boats of the natives, and causing their horses
to swim by their sides.
An hour afterwards, Pecosta accompa-
nied by his daughter and four or five of the
citizens of Santiago, the latter as a guard,
started for Matamoras. They were moun-
ted on mules, except the ppsoner, who was
seated on a donkey, with hi~ hands tied to-
gether behind him, and his feet tied under
the beast's belly. A. rope was fastened at
one end to the bit of the bridle, and the oth-
er was held in the hand of one of the guards.
It was about ten o'clock when they com-
aenced their journey, a distance of some
thirty miles. They proceeded up the river
until they reached a point opposite Burita,
at which there was a kind of ferry, where
they crossed to the Mexican side of the nv-
or.
Xn this village they stopped and baited
their horses and dined themselves. After
dinner they resumed their course, at a brisk
trot, that they might, as Pecosta said, reach
the city before the out-guards were stationed
for the night; but in reality because he feared
some treachery on the part of Pedro Muffles.
In this manner they were jogging along
three or four miles from the city, when a
young man, mounted on a coal-black Mus-
tang pony, and dashing along at a reckless
speed, as he passed bya thicket that concealed
the road in advance of the party, suddenly
appeared in their midst, and ran with such
force against the mule upon which Olinda
wan riding, that she was thrown from her
Ntj and but f~r his presence of mind and su-
perior horsemanship, she would probably
2

have been allied. As it was, he caught her
falling, and with a swing, assisted by-the mo-
tion of his horse, raised her to his withers,
and immediately after dismounted and lifted
her to the ground.
The excitement occasioned by the collision
was sudden a$ extreme, but it lasted only
for a few teoments. (flinda, who was at first
very much excited and frightened, soon r.~-
covered her spirits, and her father, instead of
reproaching the young man for his heedless-
ness, thanked him for his service.
The voice of the parent caused the young
man to lift his eyes from the beautiful face
of Olinda, and notwvhsmnding the disguise
which so effectually deceived others, he in-
stantly recognized the er-secretary.
"Rodainont!" he exclaimed, with a look
and gesture of surprise.
At the sound af this name, which they has
not heard pronounced for months, both fatbei
and daughter started, for the young man wa-
a stranger.         -
"It was in my father's house," said tb~
youth, observing their surprise and hasten~
ing to explain, '~that you were for a montI~
concealed to escape the emisaries of Santa
Anna's successor, who were charged wlib~
your secret execution."
"Alphonso MartelIaI" cried the old man,.
throwing his arms around the youth, au4'
embracing him with an affection almost pa-
rental; "my dear, dear boy, are your parents
well?"
"They are," replied Alphonsd, "and are?
at present in Matamoras, where they have
been living for some months past.. 'lliey of.."
ten speak of you, and will be rejoiced to see
you again, even in the peasant's garb that'~
enabled you to elude your pursuers."
"Olinda," said the elder, adr.lressing his' '
daughter, "this is the youn~man of Whom
you have so often heard rue speak. Alphon..
so," he addedturning to the youth, '1this is
my daughter."
Martella stepped forward and took the
maiden's dainty little hand in his own, with
such a warmth as friends manifest who.
have been a long time separated; and he ut~
tered words, scarce above a whisper, that'
brought the color to her cheeks, still ~

"You can net intimidate me by your

"Juan," cried the lieutern.ot to one of his
party. a large, heavy, square-built man, "pull

dozen with the end of your lariat."
The musketeer, sinking his rowels into his
horse's sides, rushed toward the old tuan, who,
with a sudden jerk of his bridle reins, threw
his beast upon haunches, and thus avoided
the grasp of the soldier, who designed, in
passing, to drag him from his seat.
AU this while the donkey refused to go
forward, 'and Muffles, out of patience with
the stubborn beast~ ordered his men to cut
t~ thongs: of the prisoner and mount him
upon Pecosta's mule; and then cut the use's

Immediately 'the men set to work, some .at

levelling it at Muffles breast, cried out,
"Hold 'villainsl the moment yen unseat that~

'Pull him olf," shouted Muffles, with "'an-

Scarcely were these words ~zttered, en'
jPeeosta was thrown with violence to the
ground. Olinda screamed, ar'd flung herself
from her beast to run. to her father's assis-
tance. And Alphonse Martella, true to hi#

4' the court of General Clarke while military
governor of Matamoras and its dependencies,
General Arista, surrounded by his officers
was publishing the plan of his future opera-.
lions. An orderly appeared at the door, and
at asiga from the commanding officerannoun-
ced Lopez Pocosta, who advanced to the
center of theapartment, bowed profoundly to
Arista and the other officers present, and in
a clear succiut manner, narrated all the inci-
dents of the day, and thus concluded:
"It was the order of Captain Peron that I
should report the prisoner to ~he comman-
dant at this post; accordingly, I have
brought jiim hither, and have him below in
the grand.chamber. The remains of Lieu-
tenant Muffles are there also. I regret the
death of this man, but my orders were imper.
ative, and the necessity unavoidable."
"What name bears this stripling who has
deprived us of one of the best fighting men
in the armies of Mexico?" demanded Ar-
ista, with a sternness of expression that clear-
ly showed his dissatisfaction.
"He is, if I am correctly informed," replied
Focosta "the son of General Martella"
"Alphonso?" cried Arista.
"His name may be Aiphonso," answered
Pecosta, affecting ignorance. He is very
young, almost beardless indeed, but brave as
his grandfather whose name adorns the pa-
gee of oar nation's history.
"What can a peasant know of his coun-
try's history ?" inquired Arista, glancing at
the old man with suspicion.
"I knew his grandfather well in his life-
time," replied Pecosta "and Ibe young mart
told me that his name is printed in books."
"Where did you know the great Martel-
l~~" continued Arista.
When he resided in Puebla, at which time
he and the elder Rodamont, with whom I
lived, were fast friends," answered Pecosta.
"How old are you ?" demanded the gee-
oral, abruptly, doubting the truth of his
statement.
"1 was a boy at that time," replied Pecos-
to." The younger Rodamont, who was af.
terwards secretary of war, and with whom I
Eyed up to the time of his bat~ishment, is
*     aboutmyownage."

~A.nd where is flodarnont now ?" said the
questiorior, eyeing the countenance of the old
"It was said hefl~d to the United States,"
replied Pecostawith a perfect control of his
features. "And it was runiored on the coast
a day or two since that he had crossed ~the
Nueces, and Intended to visit Matamoras
and offer hisservices to the Republic."
"I sincerely wish he lirould," said Arista,
with flashing eyes. "W"e need his services at
tbis moment."
There was ~meth1ng sinister in the ex-
pression of the general's countenance as he
uttered these words, and something in the
tone of his voice that made the old man
think of the gibbet.
"You live on the coast?" inquired Arista.
"I reside in Santiago," repliedthe old
man.
"What is your name?" said the general.
"Lopez Pecosta," replied the disguised sec
rotary.
"That is all," said the officer, with a mo
tion of his hand toward the door But at
the old man turned away he quickly caIlek
him by name and added, "Mr. Pecosta, we
desire the counsel gf Rodamout, and corn
mission you who were formerly his servant to
seek his refuge and conduct him hither
Your services will not go unrewarded."
Pecosta bowed and retired. But he wa~
s~arceIy beyond the thresholdwhen he wa~
again recalled by the general, who said.
"Give the remains of Lieutenant Muffles in.
to the hands of the guard, to he conveyed to
his friends. Turn the prisoner over to the
officer of the night, to be brought hither for

In the course of a few moments, Captain
Leonard was conducted into the presence of
Arista. His hands were crossed behind his
back and bound with thong&amp; There was
anxiety in his countenance, but his step was
firm, and his bearing undaunted.
The general of the Mexican army, said to he
one of the largest men in the republic, pri.
dot himself not a little upon his dimensions;
but when he looked upon the gigantic pro-
portions of the prisoner, he keehly felt his
own insignificance; and more particularly, as

at the moment of Pecosta's announcementhe
was speaking of the Americans, and repre-
senting them as a diminutive and effeminate
people, from whom they had nothing to fear
but the loss of their property.
"Prisoner" said the general, "to what count..
ry do you beloDg." "I am a citizen of the Re.
public of theUnited States," replied Captain
Leonard.
This morning you called yourself a citi-
zen of Buenos Ayres ?" said thegeneral.
"T did," returned the prisoner, "but it was to
avoid difficutly. lam a native of Ohio, and
a citizen of Cincinnati."
"What is the name pf your principal ho-.
tel?" inquired the general quickly, perciev-
ng from this answer that he could judge of
his truth in other things by his replies to
Interogatories requiring local information.
"When I was last in Cincinnati." replied
Captain Leonard "it was Broadway."
"Where is it situated ?" continued Arista.
You wish to tes~~y veracity" replied said
I the Captain, "for you are well acquainted
with its location, it being the hotel at which
you and Major Isadore put up during yo~Ir
'tay in that city."
"From whom did you learn these facts?"
~sked the general.
They came to my knowledge during boy-
~iood," replied the prisoner, "and in that way
which st likely to leave an impression.
A. distinguished leader of the forces of the
great republic of Mexico, an exile in a
strange country and in the midst of stran-
gerM, soon obtained a notoriety that excited
~ e curiosity of the universal Yankee nation.
As one of that people, though 'at the time
aschoolboyI felt a desire to look upon a man
who was accounted worthy to suffer, for the
cause of his country, and so ventured to the
Broadway Hotel, when I was introduced in-
to your presence, not as on this occasion, but
with unshackled hands."
The allusion to scenes and sufferings so
long past. but in which he had acte4 so
prominent apart and enduted so much ~fter-
wards, touched a tender spot in the~general'e
heart and melted it to tears.

"Unbind the prisoner," said he, as sees
as he could master his emotion.
The officer of the night, to whom these
words were addressed, immediately stepped
forward and severed the bonds tiat bound
his hands. A chair was brought for him to
sit upon, and a basin of water to reducethe
swelling occasioned by the thongs.
After a little while spent in silence, Arista
addressing the officer of the night, gave some
directions touching the arrest of Alphouso
Martella. He also directed that a party of
thirty men should he detailed, fortbwith, to
go in search of Rodamont,~who was supposed
to be somewhere within the disputed tern-
tory.
Turning to one of the officers with whom
he had been conversing, he added," Captain
Costo, I will entrust you with this expedi-
tion, and leave you in all things thereto per.
taming, to follow the dictates of your own
judgment. You may depart to-night, or wait
till morning, aslou prefer."
He next addressed the prisoner, inquiring
in wha country he had learned to talk the
Spani language.
nearly eighteen years," replied Cap.
tam   onard, "I have followed a sea-faring
life; half of that time I have commanded
a vessel, and traded along the coast of South
America; and the greater portion of the last
mentioned period I have talked no other lan-
guage."
"Then how is it that I find you in this
unpleasant situation?" asked thegeneral.
"A few months ago I tarried a cargo ci
cattle.pelts from Buenos Ayres to New Or-
leans," replied CaptainLeonard, "and while
here was solicited by General Hunt,, the
quartermaster at that p!ace~ to take a ship
load of bread to the army of occupation at
Corpus Christi. Since then, until made a
prisoner by Captain Peron, I have been ii
the employ of my government."
"I suppose your attachment foryour~ na-

interrogatively, "sincq you have been ecu-

CHAPTER VIL

The prison in whioh Captain Leonard was
eonfiued, was a small dark r~om, thp further-
esost from the plaza, situated in a back cou-~
tinuation o~ the building above z~i~utione~1.~
The entire ediflee~ including' all tAe floors
the lower story, w5s made of brick. There
was no window an the ~(ponj except a entail
aperture nepr the eel~Ing, about the size of a
~man'aban4~ Through this. at mid.dey, scarce
enOugh of light pex~eWpted to qnable the cap-
tala to see the walls Qf his prison. In one
qorner stood ~ truz~kle.bed, and;by its side a
ohair,~au~ near. at hand an earthen jar filled
with        id'    '    Costa, "is your

)' Good night," returned' Captain Leonard,
with emotion, partly occasioned by hismis.

frtune, and partly *y the kindness' of the
officer, who iminedi~tely retired and locked
the door on the outside.
For the space of an hour Captain Leonar4
walked backward and forward across the floor
of his cell, meditating upon his unfortunate
situation~ iwd striving to conjecture the des.
tiny of his little schooner. But at the end
of this time lie had only gained exhaustion,'
which perhaps enabled him sooner to forget
his Sorrows in the profound repose of youth
and innocence.
The next day the jailor brought his break~
fast about eight o'clock. It consisted of a
cup of coffee, a beefsteak, and cakes of maize,
prepared without sifting and mixed with
water. He drank the coffee, but found it mi.
possible to swallow a mouthful of the bread
or moat; not because they were unfit for diet
but for want of an appetite.
At noon the jailor came again, and then
he managed to eat a little, but his appetite
was small and easily satisfied. And agaiu
in the evening he took a few bites, and drank
another cup of coffee. And thus passed the
first day of hisimprisontuent.
All day long he bad expected a visit from
some person authorized to conduct him to
the better quarters proniised, but tue day
passed and no one entered his cell but the
sailor, who made no allusion to the mMter,
but served him in silence. ~&amp;t first he sop.
posed the apartment to be fitted for his ac
coinniodation was not made ready for want
of time, perhaps, hat he ilusily concluded,
when no one came near during the day, tbat
the promises of 'the general-in-chief were all
hollow, and hetbrew himself upon his bed
in a state of dsspalr.
The neXt utteringg 'he interrogated the
jailor, who infor~aed him that his name had
not been mentioned, to his knowledge, on the
day previous., "The mind of the command~
ant," said he, "is occupied with a matter at
more importance."
It appeared that on the &amp;veniug pi~e~Uu~,'
Aiphonso Martella, on arriving at Matiino-
ras, surrendered himself to the municipal an.
thorities, to be examined in reference to the
death of Pedro Muffles.
A short time after, the guard detailed by~

~ect, who claimed that the inihtary had no

of the alguazil was a high-handed measure
that ought not to ~O unpunished.

authorities f~r t~antination, was entitled to
an investigation of the matter at their hands;
that ixe tv'as a civil an~ not a iniiilitary citizen,
and ought therefore to be judged by the civl
and not by thQ martial law of the i~epublie;
and that the examination beibre the prefect
ought to he Ilnal and satisfactory.
On the other hand, General Arista ma~n~
~ained that asthe murdered man was an officer
of the army, the murderer ought to be tried
byacourt martial, and judgett by th~ military
law of the Republic.
It was probable that an examination be-.
fore either tribu~ial wo~dd reeu~lt in the ac-
quittal of the prisoner; but the matter in-
voaved a question which neither party was
willing to sacrifice. The state of excitement
was already very great, and the quarrel wax-
ed warmer with the lapse of time.
This information fully explainedd the cause
of the neglectCaptain Leonard had experi-
euced~ and he began to regard the dungeon
as. his' future abode. For hours after the
sailor withdrew, he paced his cell in a state'
of excitement little phort of insanity. Up
and down, and across~and back, an4 angular
-there was no course he did not take, and
~arcely a spot upou which he did, not tread.'
Once near the head~of 'his bed he felt a,
brick give slightly nuder' the pressure of his
footi, but he was too much excited at the mo.~
au~nt to derive any advantage front the die-
covery. He oniy avoided ii in future, and
oontinu'cd to pace the floor until a~ain ex-
hausted when he cast himself upon~ his bed

and tt~ied t~ thr~et Ins~tnisery; but sleep had
forsaken his eyes, and slumber his eyelids,
and after tossing about for a time he rose
andhresumed his w.~tking.
Bat though he slept nM' wlitlo he lay oi
the bed, he was nevertheless rested, and his
mental excitement to a g~eat degree allayed.
Now he 6e~an to consider~ his sltuat.ioxr die-

to the residenceofMru. Cathedra, a widow of
great wealth and beauty, who had many ad-
mirers and not a few suitors, although she
filled the alliterative. phrase, "fat, fair, and
forty," except that her complexion was de-
cidedly olive.
Now, it so happened that at the moment
Captain Leonard passed up through theearth
like Samuel at the bidding of Endor's witch,
the beautiful widow was standing at the door
of her house, within a few feet of the pris-
on wall, talking to one of her lovers who was
about to take his departure.
The beams of the moon were exceedingly
brilliant, and the walLof the prison was cov-
ered with their light, though the widow and
her lover stood within the shadow of her
dwelling.
The widow, whose face was turned toward
the wall at the moment of the disrupture of'
the earth and sudden appearance of a creature
whom she thought the princeofPandemonium
shrieked and fled into the house, leaving her
lover to divine, as beet he bould, the cause
of her singular behaviour.
The noise of the breach attracting his at-
tention, he turned about just at tfie moment
Captain Leonard removed the blanketfrom
his head, and seeing a man hale-way protrud-
ed through the earth, with a long beard
sweeping his breast, mistook him for the spir-
it of Samuel himself, and was scarcely less
frightened than the widow, and fled with as
much precipitation.
Half a douen of the lower liricks fell from
their places, and that part of the wall imnie-
diately above the Subterranean passage, sunk
several inches; but the pressure from each
side prevented a general crash.
But the aperture was so much diminished
by the wall's depression, that it became nec-
essary to remove a couple of bricks before
Pecosta could force his body through.
"Captain Leonard," said ho, speaking
through the passage, "the removal ofa single
brick will cause the entire waIl to crumble
down; the noise will rouse the garrison, and
we shall be recaptured before we are fairly
free.~ Make use of your liberty, and leave
me to my fate."

'No," returned Captain ..eonard, "I will
not forsake a fellow prisoner."
"But there can be no sympathy between'.
as such as other criminalsfeel for each other,"
said Fecosta, "for you are a prisoner otwar,
and I a prisoner of the law ; you are confined
to deprive your country of your services, but
I by legal arrest, to suflbr for a crime."
"True," replied Captain Leonard,, "we
have not the emotions of criminals, for we
have not sinned like them; but thereje the
sympathy which one human being feels for
another in distress and that's enough to jus-
tify my further assistance."
"But there is no law of our nature stronger
than self-preservation," said Fecosta, "and
not even gratitude requires the sacrifice or
one man's life to save another's."
~"A man may take another's life to save
his own, and by the law be justified," re-
turned Captain Leonard," because there is
nothing dearer to a man than his life, and
such an act is human. And a man may if
he chose, give his life for another's and none
should condemn' the sacrifice, for the deed is
divine, at leaat so far as emulation extends,
Christ having died for a sinful world."
"But if you -remain here," said the Mcxi-
.cau, "both may be lost; whereas, if you fly
at once, one may escape. I will wait a few
minutes, until I think you have got beyond
the wall that encloses the garden, before I
attempt to enlarge the aperture."
"I will not go," said Captain Leonard,
firmly. "It shall never be said, that I aban-
doned a fellow prisoner. It Is enough that
we have occupied, though for an hour only,
the same dungeon cell."
"YOu Americans are a 'singular pco~le,"
said Pecosta. "But a few mornings since,
you seized me by the throat, dashed me to
the earth, called me liar and scoundrel, and
now you basard your life to save mine.

"Thea bow can ~ strangergain admittance

"He may knock at the front doer the same

costa, "and if he is a person who ought to be
admitted, which may be' aetern*ined (rota the
balcony, he will be invited to pass round to
the wicket, at which a servant will be found
ready to conduct him tobie mistress. These
things are not uncommon in Mexic~ cities
that are garrisoned." . /1
"What shall we do next?" a~k#I Captain
Leonard.
"Remain~ quiet," quickly replied Pecosta,
"until the persons I hear Wking without
shall have passed."
"They have stopped at thegate," said Cap.
tam Leonard; "they are about to enter."
"Follow me," said Pecosta, darting from
the wall, andfiying with the speed of a young
man to the opposite side of the enclosure.
Captain Leonard did as directed, though
he found it no very easy undert~king, so
quick was the start and so rapid the flight
of the Mexican.
When they reached the opposite wall, a
continuation of the prison from which they
had Just escaped, they threw themselves
upon the ground in the shadow of an orange
tree, at the same time to avoid detection and
make observations.
.PresenUy, the wicl~et from which they had
just fled, was thrown open, and several per-
eons entered, and having closed it again, pro-
ceeded toward the spot where Captain Leo-
nard appeared, issuing from the ground to.
Mire. Cathedra and her suitor.
"We must not reinahi here," said Pe. t
coeta; "for the moment our escape is die- I t

"But how shall we get there?" said Cap.
tam Leonard. "Between us and it there
are a hundred yards of space, and eviry one
is filled with the rays of the moon."
We must glide from tree to tree, 'and from
bush to bush, until we reach the opposite
wall," answered Pecosta. It is not the first
time I have thus ~caped~
Au he finished speaking, he darted from the
side of his companion, and like a streak of
light, so quick was the movement, passed to
the shadow of a poramegranate bush.
Captain Leonard *as preparing to fellow,
when his eye accidentally fell upon a postein
partially concealed by the shadow of the tre-
under which he was standing. Therefore
instead of following Pecosta, as was hs in-
tention a moment previous, he turned to and
examined the, gate, which, to his surprise,
was fastened only with a latch. Of this fact
he immediately informed Pecosta, who~ re-
turned to the shadow of the Orange-tree, with
a celerity that showed his eagerness t~ escape
from the enclosure.
In the space of another minute the fugi-
tives had passedthe wicket, which they closed
aller them, and fastened, by drawicig a stick
through the~handle of' the latch. They were
now in the enclosure of General Martilla,
whose wife and Mrs. Cathedra were very
ntirnate, and kept up a daily intercourse by
neans of this postern; but these facts were
unknown to them until afterward.
CHAPTER LX.
The fugitives, after a brief consultation
touching their future movements, proceeded
~ explore the wall of the enclosure which
hey had lust entered; hut, save the wicket
breugh which they escaped, they foi~n~ no
peiiing on the south side, nor on the past,~s-

but a considerable portion of the city, and
produced a general consternation.
It was afterwards made to appear, that
enact lire exa~$ning party In the adjo4iing
apolosure, seeing the pendant brick which the
clothes of Pecosta had partially displaced,
thoughtlessly struck it with tir. end of his
baton, and forced it from its fastenings. As
before observed, this brick was the key to
the whole arch, and when It fell there was
nothing to support the wall and roof, both
of which came tumbling down with a fearful
noise, and completely crushed and covered
theprls6ners bed beneath the ruins.
When the astonishment had in a measure
subsided, or ore were given to remove the
rubbish an extricate the prisoners, who
were sup sed to be underneath. A party
of soldicr~s were immediately set to work,
who, aftsr half an hour's vigorous labor,
reached the bed, which they found brokeii
dowe, but unoccupied.
Up to thi~ time the story of Mrs. Cathe-
dra's lover bad received but little attention,
and even now it was not fully credited. That
the prisoners had escaped by a subterranean
passage was obvious upon examination; but
the opinion obtained generally that they had
received assistance.
As Velasquez Rornanno, the lover above
mentioned, was the' only peiuon present who
had witnessed the prisoner's eruption, ~nd
as the story Itself was highly improbable in
the opinion of the officer of the night, he fell
under instant suspicion, which was mani-
fested at the moment rather by significant
looks and nods thati by words, for he was a
merchant of the city, a man of great wealth
and influence, and almost universally re-
speCt8d~
But when these facts were reported to
.krlsta, he orderedihe merchant to be imme-
diately arrestedaild kept in cotifinement sub.
ject to his farther orders. But Captain Bar
beta, 'who was a personal friend of Romanno,
after his arrest being charged with his cue.
tody~ released ~hi~n ~n his parole, believins,
po~wlthutandlng ~.rista~s suspicion, that his
lnuot.ence w~iuld be clearly, and if certain in~
formation should prove to be correct, pert
haps easily established.

Meanwhile the fugitives lay close to the
ground in the shadoW of the east wallfor the
Inmates of the dwelling, alarmed by the crash,
bad gathered together upon the vestibule
and the slightest movement could not have
escaped their observation .
CaptainBarbata, who, as before observed,
believed the story of his friend, concluded
that the fugitives, the wicket having been
properly secured, were somewhere conceakd
within Mrs. Cathedra's garden.
Acting vpon this belief, a company ci
searchers were formed, to make an examina-
tion; but after the lapse of half an hour, the
garden having been thoroughly scrutinized,
an inspection0of the wall was ordered, and
the poster through which the prisoners es
caped discovered.
* As the gate was barred on the other side,
Romanno was dispatched to inquire of Mrs.
Cathedra concerning the communication. Ii
a few moments he returned with information
to the effect, that the wicket opened Into her
garden from general Martella's, and that it
had never been fastened. other than with a
latch, since the General's family came to re-
Bide in MatamoraS.
This intelligence increased a suspicion al~
ready existing in the minds of Captain Bar-
bate and others present, that the former
friendship of Martella anctflodamont, had in-
duced the former to procure the latter's libe-
ration.. It was well known that in all the
army, Santa Anna~ had not so devoted and
fearless a friend as the General nor any where
so able and tr~ithfiil a counsellor as the ex-
secretary; and these facts were the ground
of suspicion.
On receiving this information, Captain
Barbata, who was a secret enemy of General
Martella, ordered the examiners to stave the
postern, and search his premises, and If neces-
sary, not to spare his lady's bedroom. The
last clause of this sentence was a sort of gene.
ral license todo whatever inclination prompt
ed, and was made that the soldiers might give
the family all possible annoyance.
No sooner were the orders pronounced,
than they sett~ work tocarryit into effect,
-. with an energy~that clearly showed in whaV
sense it was understood. A very few ini~

ments sufficed to break the bolt, or the handi
of the gate through which it was thrust, an
thea they came teeming into Martilla's in
~closure.
During all the time occupied in the re
moval of the rubbish from the broken bed
and the examination of Mrs. Oathedra'e
garden, the fugitives had remained in th
place and position above mentioned; bul
when the searchers forced their way through
the poster, further concealment was im
possible.
'~ We must now run for our lives," said
Pecosta; "for the Philistines are upon us.1'
"Whither shall we run ?" inquired Captain
Leonard. "We are encompassed by walk
half as high as the houses to which they are
attached; besides, the moment we move
we become visible."
"Do you suppose my young friend," said
the Mexican, energetically, "that by remain.
big here we shall escape discovery? I assure
you there i~ot a foot of ground within the
enclosure tha will not be examined."
." I do not,"~answered Captain Leonard.
"But I repeat, whither shall we fly ?-how
shall we get beyond these walls?"
"To the housa, and through the house,"
replied Pecosta, springingto his feet. "Fol.
low me, quick," he added, darting off in the
shadow of the wall toward the dwelling.
Captain Leonard instantly obeyed: but
he had not made above a dozen steps, when
the surface of the ground gave way, and he
disappeared from the sight of recosta as
suddenly as he had appeared a while before
to Romanno and the beautiful widow.
The noise of the rupture attracted the at..
tension of the soldiers, one of whom, seeing
the Mexican in his fight, which he continued
notwithstanding the sudden disappearance of
his companion, cried out, "Rodamont," and
gave immediate chase. Tbeothers,.catching
up the cry, hurried away in the same direc-
tion.
As they rushed forward eager in the pur-
suit, and heedless of their steps, one of the
foremostinthe chase chanced upon the chasm,
and 'involuntarily followed Captain Leonard
into his subterranean concealment. Iliscom..
onionsn, indifferent to his fate under the ex-

e citement, held on their course, and entered
I the house soon after the fugitive.
- lt~was not until Pecosta was within a few
rods of the building, that he recognized the
residence of General Martella; but ~this die.
cover inspired him with hope, and animated
him to greater exertions.
The lower door of the house had been
opened for the egress ot the servants, one of
whom stood upon the threshold, resolved to
proteethis master's domicile against intruders.
~ut he had scarcely determined his duty,
when Pecouta darted past him, mounted the
stairs, passed through the scuttle, and stood
upon the house.top.

bricks such as are generally used in tropical
countries for floors and pavement&amp; On the
* west side of the Plasa do ilidalgo, from the
residence of Mrs. Cathedra to the corner of
the block, and thence westward to the corner
of the cross-street, the houses were all joined
together, and a person might pass from the
roof of one to the roof of another without
difficulty.
Lbpez Pecosta, when he reached the house.
top, did not pause to survey the scene below,
in which servants and soldiers were striving,
the one to gain and the other to prevent an
entrance; but hurried away toward the west
until he reached the futhermost house, to
which was attached another running back,
with a sloping roof, the eaves of which at one
end touched the wall. Down this roof he
hastened, and then along the wall to the ex-
tremity, when he disappeared.
By this time Alplionso Martella, by his
presence and authority, had quelled~ the
-strife between his father's domestics and the
repulsed soldiers, and then the following con-
versation ensued.
"What means all this confusion?" said the
young man to one of the soldiers.
"We are in pursuit of ,pld Rodamount,
who has escaped from prison and sought re-
fuge in this house," replied the man addess..

"But there isbetweenthis garden and Mrs.

the seeker, with increased impatience.
"Tbeyare not in this house," said Martihla.
"It is only a few momentsuince thed~or was

"It is false,"said the soldier. "I saw him

the receptaclelxOlookSd tobediscever5d, and
had neither the means of concealment nor tb
escape. This was his apprehension, that his ci
~ursuer5, seein% tlit chasm, would cause the sc
cistern to be explored; and it was increased n~
by the misfortune of their companiOn, whom CI
they would certainly seek and find at the
bottom9
Hoping that his disappearance had es- ti
caped the observation of all but Rodamount, i'
he dre.gged the body of the dead Mexican
which had tumbled toward the center of the
reservoir, back to the opening, that it might b
be discoVered by the first who entered; and
the manner in which it was subsequently die- e
posed of, has been already related.
After the soldierfrhad abandoned the search
and returned to their quarters, Capt. Leonard h
endeavored to extricate himself, but without
success: for the board that yielded to his
weight in a horizontal position, and by means
of which he tried to reach the top of the re-
servoir, did no better service as an inclined I
plane.
It was now evident ~that at the bottom of. 4
this cistern he was obliged to remain until
assistance was afforded by Rodamount, or, if I
.J of his power, by some one he himself
might attract to the breach by his cries.
However, for the~ present he resolved not to
give an alarm, lest he should discover h~s
lurking.plO.Eie to tome patrol or sentinel, but
to wait until the morning, when some person
belonging to the family ehonld pass by, to
visit the broken fiower-be~L -
Accordingly, he threw himself upon the
floor of the cistern, ~which like the sides was
smoothly plastered, and being fatigried, soon
fell asleep. It was nine o'clock the next
morning when he awoke, and the first
sound that greetedhis ear, was the musical
voice of Olinda Rodainont. For a moment
he believed she was sent thither by her father,
to effect his further liberation; butter words
which were distinctly heard, soon convinced
him of the contrary.
"Let me talk of my father, of the bearded
American. of this broken cistern that will
hold no water, of anything on earth, Al-
phonse, but love," said the maiden earnestly.

"Ikuow that thOse you have specified are
ie popular themes of gossip throughout the
ty," replied Martella, whey voice the pri-
immer instantly recognized, "but they have
r interest for me beyen~l the pleasmr~e oc~
isionOd by your IMlier's escape."
"See how little Lola's flower-bed is bro-
en?' said Olinda, wishing to avert his
droughts from the subject he was endeavor-
ig to introduce.
"It can be mended?' returned Martella,
but if you break my heart, Olinda, I should
ecome a wreck."
Aiphonso," said themaiden, with increased
arneetness, "why will you persist, when
hereby both of us are rendered miserable?"
"It is in your power to make us both
appy ;" replied Martilla, "but I fear you
will not, unless you are urged."
"And will not if urged by all the friends
have on earth," returned Olinda, em-
)haticall
y.
"Captain Peron is in no respect your
~quaI," persisted Martilla, not a particle die.
3ouraged by her emphatic manner; "and in
i. moral point of view, he is totaUy unworthy
of one so pure in thought, and so prudent in
behavior."
"it may be true, Alphonse," said Olinda;
but it becomes me not to hear remarks ut-
tered in dispraise of one to whom I am affi-
anced."
"But~ it is your duty to consider them,"
returned the youth, "for the happiness of a
life-time is of vastly more importance than
the fulfilment ofa promise. Besides, Olinda,
you do not love him,.and rio woman should

"Proceed, Aiphonso," said the maiden,
resignedly, "my imprudence merits your tor~
ture."
"Your imprudence, Olinda," exclaimed the
youth; "you have never done an imprudent
thing in you life."
"Have! not?" said the young lady. "Then
to confess a love for one and he betrothed to
another is not an imprudence."
"Net so great a one certainly," replied
Martilla, "as to love one and wed e.nothe~."

"I will leave you, dear, if it is your wish,"

"Do you fear that I shall destroy my life,'
ked the maiden. "But you need nut, it
not yet so great a burden. I prefer to re-

"I go, then," said Alphonse; "but I carry

With these words he turned away, and
alked slowly toward the mansion, leaving
linda by the broken flower bed.

"One who entered unwillingly, ~hut would

tInder the guidance of a young man select-
ed for his courage and trust-worthiness,
Captain tAeonard started upon his perilous
iourn~y immediately after his deliverance.
The n~oon was above the horizon, and shin-.
ing as brightly as it had ever done in Mexico4
There was not a cloud to obscure its beams
not a mist to dim it rays Earth, air and
sky were illuminated.
Guide and fugitive, side by side,. and in the
shadow of the hous~~~, left the mansion of
Martilla, and started toward the river. lint
"the streets of Matamoras were at that time
partrolled from dark to 'day-light, a~d several
times on their' way they were challenged,

They niet with no Serious opposition, how-
ever, until they had passed beyond the city
proper and entered the suburbs, where they
were again challenged, and being exposed to
the uuoon'slisht, Captain Leonard was recog.-
nized and immediately- ~rreeted. But~ the
guide4 taking advantage dt the snrpri~ 'und
soy-of the patrolslipped away unobserved,
and effected his ese4se.
Captain Leonard w&amp; placed: between tV4~
soldiers, having loaded muskets ~vith the

bayonets fixed, who were ordered to conte~
him safely to the quarters of the comiteauid
ante The patrol, except the two detalIe~
to conduct the prisoner, continued om thel
course; and these set about to ~xecuite thel
orders.
That there might be no possibility
escape, theywalkedso close the prisoner tbt
his and their elbow touched. And i
* this manner they proceeded until the patro
was out of sight and hearing, when (laptal
Leonard, striking each guaad across th
throat at thesame moment and throwing lii
weight of his own body backward, assistedb~
the strength of his arms, hurled them both I
the ground and fled.
By this action one of tb~enn was stunned V
insensibility, but the other, who was consid
ably injured by the fall, discharged his mu
* ket, and summoned the patrol to their assis
ance.
Meanwhile the fugitive had reached II
river and taken possession of the bomtbavii~

some resistance. But thepatrol immediately

His pursuers immediatelyrowe4 their boats
to the bank, and gave chase among the chap-
arab The prisoner was swift of foot, and
having a loi~g start, soon left them behind
and out of sight. But escaping from one
danger he ran directly into another.
Captain Costawhoni Arista had dispatched
in search of Hernando Rodamount, having
scoured the country between the Rio Grande
and the Nueces, for fifty miles from. the coust,
was on his return to the city. lie was en-
camped to rest ~r~d refresh his horses during
the heat of the day, and was concealed be'
neath a ~clump of ~osqueet trees, which Cap-
tain Leonard endeavored to place between
himself and purs~crs
This brought him completely within the
powe~ of the searching party, who made him
a prisoner, and conducted hiui to Matamo-
ms1 where he was Confined in the city prison.
The question between the civte and milit-
ary authorities, touching the arrest and trial
of AlphonsoMartella, which had been referred
to the Ecesident for decision, was nOt yet set.-
tied, and a new difficulty arose out oUthe
capture of Captain Leonard.
The prefect of the~ city refused to receive
the prisoner or be aei~ountable for his securi-
ty, unless the general would resigrt Martella
into the hands of the municipal authorities;
rand Arista, inflamed on account of his arro-
gance, threatened to place the city under
inartiallawand take forcible possession of the
prison.
At this juncture General Martella arrived
in the city, andyroposed that his eon should
be submitted for an examination before both
authorities, and be judged by the laws of
each; and that as the military,- except under
the most critical circumstances, ought~to be
subservient to ith~ civil powers, the first ex~
examination should be made by the authorities
to whom the supposed offender had surren~
dere&amp;himself.
A~ this, could be done independent uf'the
abntracti'ou submitted for the decision et
President Jierrera, the~ proposition was at~

once adopted, and the young 'man, after .a
great deal of verbiage and speculation was
honorable aquit~ed, on the grounds ofjnstift.
catioui and'seIt-defeu~e, by both tribijuale.
The adjustment of this ditei~etice rt~movec1
the difficulty fn ref~euce to Captain Leon-
ard's impris6nmeiit, and he was thrust like
Paul' into the iuner dungeon, after being sev.-
erely scoured by order of Captain Barhata,
who was that day the officer in' charge of the
post.
Sandoval Ambrosia, a humane man, and
one of the Alcaldes of the city, being in-
formed of this barbarous treatment, first corn.-
plained of it to Arista, and then visited the
prisoner, whom he ordered to be brought forth
into the light prison, when he had his back an-
ointed, and a bed brought for his repose. H~
afterwards sOnt him some palatable i-efreslt~
ments, and did many other little thhi~s for his
cotnfoi-t.
The noit day~ General Martella's division
entered the city, and encamped 'bn the Old
Pifiza, and the day following the Tainpico
Guards and Le Vega's Artillery arrived. And
on~ the third, which was the 5e~enth before
the battle of PalO Alto, all the troops at Ma.
tamoras, to the number of about et~ht thbnsm-~
and, were marshalled in the PisiM de Hidsd~
go, to be revIewed the geuer~t-in-eliiet~
On this occasion' G~neraI arista again t~
spoke of the American soldiery, but rno1~ in
the same contemptuouS terms used' on"the~eve-
ning of the d~y of Captain Leonard's arrest.
Now he carried his descd~tion tofli6 othen~
extreme, and represented theta as a gigantic
people, wit~h Tong' beards; strong arms, brave
spirits, and~crnel hearts; in short, as barbar.-
ianS, who kill~d,'rava~ed and ~onsumed from

tam Leonard if he was ready to die, adding
that in Mexico, if a prisoner, in an effort to
escape, caused directly or indirectly the death
of another person, he was accounted a mur-
derer, and was punished accordingly.
Captain Leonard replied that lie was in
their power, and however unjust his condein-
nation and punishment, he had not the power
to prevent their execution. He then reques-
ted a pen and paper thas he might indite a
letter to General Taylor.
At the mention of this name the officer
smiled, and said-
"You can .ave writing materials ifyou des-
ire, and may write a dozen ~pistlesto the chief
of the invaders, but they will avail you noth-
ing, for it is General Aripta's intention to
cross the river in a short time, perhaps on to.
morrow, and drive the Army of Occupation
beyond the Nueces."
"With the force you nave marshalled on
that ~'laza?" inquired Captain Leonard, con-
temptuously.
"That is a much greater force than the
American army," replied Barbato.
"But in the army of the Anglo-Saxon, es-
pecially on this side of the Atlantic," replied
Captain Leonard, "no inax~ is received who
cannot whip his weight in #ld-cats."
"The American is great boaster," returned
the officer, "and bragadocia is an infallible
sign of cowardice."
"0 no, sir, the Americ~n is not a brag-
gart," replied Captain Le~nard. "It would
be no boast for General houston to say he
conqueredd Santa Anna at S~n Jacinto. There
is nothing the American ~ilI not undertake,
and nothing he cannot accomplish."
"Villain I" cried the officer, in a great pas-
sion, "how dare you mention Houston and
Sa~ J~cinto in my presence ?'~
"I thought the recolleot~on of them might
assist you to form a more ~~orrect conclusion
iii 'reference to the power~ of the American
soldiery," r.~glied Captain ~.eonard.
"Barbarian," said the officer, "It is General
Arista's intention to engage the army of Oc-
cupation in open battle,~to defeat and disperse
Its members, i~i~ capture its general, put out
his eyes, and exnioit him throughout the lie-
public of Mezico.~'

"The man who is capable of such a deed,'
returned the prisoner, "is worse than a bar.
barian."
"Dare you speak so of Mexico's favorite?'
demanded Barbata, drawing his sword.
"Would you strike a prisoner ?" said Ca?
lain Leonard, stepping back towards tis
wall.
"I would thurst my sword through the
arch-bishop himself, were he to apply such a
term to Arista," replied the officer, striking
at the face of the prisoner, and cutting away
a portioii of his beard.
"Brute I" exclaimed Captain Leonard,
seizing a broken brick that lay on the sill
of the window, and assuming an attitude of
defence.
"Do you defy me ?" said the enraged Bai
bata, springing forward with his swors
raised above his head, and his arm stretches'
to its utmost capacity.
Captain Leonard, compelled in order t~
save his own life, hurled the brick at the ot
fleer, and struck him full in the forehead, a~
the ruddy faced stripling of Israel did tlu
great' champion of the Phulistines, but in
stead of the like fatal result the officer re
ceived only a severe cut of several inches ii
length, which laid the flesh open to lbs
skull.
Now Captain Barbata's rage knew nr~
bounds, and had he not been blinded by the
blo9d of the wound, the prisoner must ham
lost his life.
At length when the troops were all mar'
shelled around the Plaza, with faces toWard
the centre; when' Arista, sitting 'on horse.
backing the midst of the square, had harran.
gued them for an hour, descanting upon the
prominent traits upon the American charac.
ter, and portraying the death and deso.
nation that would fall upon the Mexican peo'
pie if their army was defeated ; when news of
the injury received by Captain l3arbata had
been officially received and in like' manner
communicated to the army, with a false ac.
count of the prison translation that placed
Captain Leonard in a very unjcst light, y~t
stimulated the curiosityy of the impatient sol-
diery, Who had been promised a sight of the
prisoner, Captain Costa was ordered to bring

him forth, that he might be exhibited as a
fair specimen of the people whom they were
expected to meet and conquer.
CHAPTER ~IL
While Captain Costa was preparing the
psison~t for exhibition, the troops were all
faced about, and the general and his staff, all
of whom were on horseback, leaving the cen-
tre of the square, took a position immediately
in front of the prison. The line of the troops
was also extended, by marching them toward
the houses that surrounded the square, and
by reducing the number of ranks. When
within thirty feet of the building they were
caused to halt, this space being reserved for
the passageof the prisoner and the mounted
officers. By this arrangement the troops were
enabled to obtain a close observation of
captainn Leonard, while the citizens who oc~'
cupied the pavements and balconies, were in
dke manner gratified.
At length every thing being in readiness,
the prisoner was led forth bareheaded, with
his hands bound behind his back, with a
tope of several yards in length, each ~nd of
which was firmly held in the hands of an~al-
guazil, who walked behind. The position of
the prisoner was in front of the procession, a
politic arrangement of the general, who was
excessively fond of admiration, and not choos
to be rivalled by an American captive. He
clearly perceived that if he and his suite rode
.u front, anxiety would induce the beholders
to look over their heads; whereas, on the
contrary, if the prisoner was put foremost,
after their curiosity was gratified, or the ob.
ject of it beyond 'further observation, their
eyes would then be turned admiringly upon
their general and his splendid retinue.
Captain Leonard left his prison under the
apprehension of death, though the fear that
filled his breast was not visible in his coun-
tenance. He resolved to die as became an
Amerkan, and moved forward with an~un-
Jaunted step, and a look of defiance, which
greatly enhanced the impression made by the
general'~ 'representations.
On leaving his cell, he observed that the
balconies in front of the houses which sur-

rounded the Plaza, were filled with persona
of both sexes, whose curiosity was scarcely
less than that of the soldiers and rabble;
and the thought occurred to him that among
&amp;e ladies he might catch a glimpse of the
sweet and beautiful face of Olinda Reda-
mont.
The city prison adjoined the old legislative
hall on the north side, as the mansion of Mrs.
Cathedra did on the opposite. Hence as, the
prisolier first moved toward the north
the curiosity of the handsome widow was the
last to be gratified, though, perhaps, in con-
sequence of the fright she had received~ it
was more highly stimulated than any body's
else.
In front of the procession, to clean away
all obstruction, a platform of musketeers.
with fixed bayonets, and weapons to charge,
were marched immediately before the prison-
er, who was thus rendered conspicuous.
That all might have an opportunity iso
make a thorough examination, the procession
was caused to move like a funeral, which en-
abled the prisoner, not only to observe the
countenances of those who filled the balconies,
but to notice the appearance and equipage of
the soldiery, among whom he most admired
the two divisions henceforth specified, Le
Vega's artillery and the Tampico guards.
Captain Leonard was not a military mar~
he lacked even the taste and judgment of an
amateur; but the opinion formed of the troop.
at that time, was fully confirmed by their
subsequent deportment, especially at Resaca
do Ia Palma, when the guards were the last
to leave the field, and Li Vega was captured
with a torch in his hand.
There was not a female face visible at the
windows or on the balconies that Captain
Leonard did not 'closely scrutinize, but are-
ong them all he nowhere beheld the fafr
features of Olinda. lie had already~passed
the north, the east, and the south sides of tto
square, and so much ~f the west as lay norta

of his search, and he began to feel like one
who treads alone a banquet hall deserted,
There was yet one house to pass before he
arrived, at~ the barracks. It did not occur Is
him until they had passed all the otherfr

Ir~peon earth cnn heaven-so long as there ii
'was strength in his arm or efficacy in the (

Captain Leonar~ was a man of good edu- n
cation, wide experience, and extensive tra. ~
vel; he had seen the beauty of many coun-
tries, in Its most attractive guise, and wit- t
messed, in almost every clime, the exquisite t
pleasure and transcendent happiness of ma- ~
trimnonial life; and yet lie had lived until his
days were six-and-thirty years, without a de- ~
gire to change his condition. But the sIght ~
of beauty weeping on account of his mnis~ (
fortune and misery, roused the latent affec.. I
tiori of his heart, stimulated his ambition to I
higher purposes, and determined his career
of future usefulness.
These reflections, though the consequence
of an imaginary change in his situation, as
will presently appear, had a beneficial effect 1

)aptain Leonard. "Uisde~ortmenttoWad

riorning, has been as rude and cr~iel as your
wa has been manly and gallant."
He then went on to report the conversa-
ion which passed between himself and Oap~
am Barbata, and to describe the scene in
ibich he had been victorious.
"I do net doubt the truth svtyour r*labion,"
aid Captain Costa, "although Barbata des.
tribes the int.ereourse and encounter in very
liffeient language. But his punishment, if
iot greater than the occasion demanded, is
nuch greater than I could have desired."
"To what' extent Is. he injured?" inquired
Daptain Leonard, with solicitude. "1 should

"I presume there will be no objections,"
replied Captain Costa, though your corn~
inunication 'with the former eFould have to
undergo inspection."
"Such a precaution is highly prophet " said
Captain Leonard. "I only desire to inform
him of my situation, and to inquire if he
possesses the means necessary to secure my
deliverance "

"And meantime," said Captain Leonard
"I will prepare a Commtinicatiop.kif you wilt
send me ink awl paper, and if ik is not ap-
proved, it ean be destroyed."
Upon the paper used in Mexico there is a
~mp duty, which rendered it at that time
very expensive, afact that Captain j4eonard
was ignorant 4~f until long afterwards. But
Gaptain Costa, whose deportipeni~ toward
him had been courteous on all occasions, sus-
pecting that he had been robbe~1 of his
money as well as his ship and liberty, p~ir~
chased for his use a case of writing materials
and some ~ne white English paper, and sent
them to him with a note informing him of
arista's perinissiou~.-an act of kindness that
was subsequently remembered to his sslvan.
CHAPTER XIII.
Having obtained the co~isent of the Mex-
ican. General, Captain Leonard opened the
writing desk sent hint by the kind.hearted
Captain Costa, and taking from .it a sheet of
paper, wrote a brief note to the American
Consul at that place, requesting an interview.
This he dispatched open by a messenger, feel-
ing assured that it would~never reach its ~is~s-
tination unexamined. Re then returned lo
the desk and wrote a long letter to General
Taylor, to whom he recounted all the events
that had passed from the time he left New
Orleans up to the moment of the writing.
This letter he folded ~aud addressed to the
Commander of the Army of Occupation, but
left it unsealed that it might be examined
before it was ~forwarded.
He had jn4t completed his h~bors, when
Mr. 8hatsell,1~he American Consul, was an-
uounced, Ca~iu Leonard immediately arose
sand extended is hand to the red faced, round
.bellied old man who stood at the door of his
pajsou. After the usual salutations, Captain
Leonard apologized for having troubled him
on his own account, but that he f9und his
loneliness so oppressi~~and his confinement
.$0 ineu~pportabIe, that he was anxious if there
~was any way in his power, to obtain his ii-
oration.

Mr. Shateell assured him that he was ao~
aware of his capture until that morning, ba~
ing suspended his official relations with the
government doinicil. But that on that
morning he had come ont to witness the re.
review of the army, and wae painfully sur.
priced at the sight of a fellow countryman ~
bonds and upon exhibition. And that he
had obtained permission to visit him in hii
confinement, and inquire the circumstances
connected with his iniprisonmefit.
Captain Leonard thanked him very warr~
ly for his disinterested sympathy, adding, "I
am delighted to see you, even if it is not in
your power to relieve me. This solitary
confinement is not endurable."
"My dear sir,.-my countryman," said Mr.
Shatsell, earnestly, laying his hand upon the
knee of the prisoner, "I should have called
upon you and done all in my power to relieve
your necessities and protect you from insult
and abuse, if I had inly known you were
here. But as I have already said, I was first
aware of the fact this morning."
"Is there anything you can do toward af-
fectin~ my liberation?" inquired Captain
Leonard. "I am anxious to be at liberty.".
"I presume I can do nothing to secure your
permanent liberty," replied the Consul.
"Thejhold you as a prisoner of war, and my
official capacitica are all civil. However, I
may relieve you of your confinement, if you~
will accept a parol.
"That I will do witb pleasure under the
circumstances," replied Captain Leonard.
"Indeed, as for the matter of that, I may
considermyself in that situation at the pre.
sent moment. You see those wooden bars;
well, it would not be difficult for meto break
them and enjoy the liberty I so much desire.
But I could not remain in 'this city if my
liberation was thus obtained, and I should
rather remain in this prison than be compels
ed to fly to Texas.
"Whatl" exclaimed the Consul, surprised
"prefer ~m Mexican prison to the wide prairies
of free Texas, and you an American?"
Captain Leonard was about to confess his
love fo~ the unknown beauty where commi.
seration had ~o excited his love, as the only
way to satisf~ the surprised Consul, wh~ was

en the verge of indignation, when the kinc
mess of the arcade occurred to his mind, auc
he made It the excuse for the supposed pro

Is he not justified, as a man of honor, in pro'
- fearing his confinement?"
"He is, most assuredly;" replied the Consul
with a warmth of manner that made the ob-
serving Captain suspect his southern origin.
'But this is a condition in your case with
which I was not acquainted, fly whose
kindness do you enjoy the air and light?"
"My benefactor is one of the alcades of the
aity,' but I do not recollect his name," re-
plied Captain L~onard. "He is a mat~ per-

tn~ly meagre, resembling a corpse more than
.a living animal. But he has a beaming eye

Shatsell, and he is every way worthy of the
good opinion you have formed of him. He is
unive~ally respected among his own people,
and is my favorite. I like him very much.
He is a gentleman and a scholar. He has
travelled in our country, and has a high
opinion of our people. You will value his
acquaintance."
"I trust I have a just appreciation of his
kindness, which was entirely voluntary," said
Captain Leonard, "and I long to be at liber-
ty that I may make the proper acknowledge.
ments br his disinterested benevolence."
"I certainly wish it was in my power to
procure ~'our li'berty," said the consul, with
regret; "but I cannot see how I am to serve
you in this respect. It may be that Gener-
alTaylor, ifinformed of your situation, could

"I had just coucluded a comm~inieatio,~ to
him before you arrived," said Capt. Leonard.
"So then, you had no ~monfidenc&amp;in my
assistance after all?" said the consul.
"You cannot think so if you received ray
letter," replied Captain L~onard.
"Your letter.?" replied the consul. "Why,
I saw no letter from you."
"I dispatched one to you an hour before
this was concluded," said Captain Leonard,
placing the end of his finger upon the letter
before him, "and supposed you came hither
at my request."
"No, my son, I came -of my own free will
and accord," replied the consul. "lam grat-
ified that you sought my assistance. It does
my soul good to aid one that I know will ap-

"And I am more highly gratified that you
came of your own choice," replied Captain
Leonard.
"Well, well, my son, it seems to have tur-.
ned out to our mutual advantage," said Mr.
Shateell. "But enough of this. Let me see
your letter to General Taylor. You need
not hesitate to show it to me, for it will be
read by the Mexican General, or In his pres-
ence, before it will be dispatched to Corpus

"It was my intention to submit it for your
perusal and approval," said Captain Leon.

vantage, I should also like to have your ceu'~

So saying, he .himnded the letter to Mr.
Shateell, ~vho read it carefully throughout,
and at the conclusion expressed his approba
tion.
"There is one thing that might as well
have been omitted," said the consul, "and
they may require you to expunge it, and
that is the description of your ~naltreab~
ment.~'  -     -
"I have thought as much myself," replied
Captain Leonard; "but it will be an east

CLIAPTER xv
Oa~talnBarbata, on leaving the prison,
had mounted his horse which a servent held
at th~ door, and rode at an ambling pace to'
thO other end of the city, where he entered~
the max'ket placeand'paused at the door of
Valarequier Roniano. H~ knoOked againstt
the door with th~hntt of hit whip, and im~
immediately it was opened by a ~ex'vant, who
led the horse into the house directly after hie
master had entered, and through to the gar..
den, wher~lie: was secured to a post for that
kind of purpose~
Another Servant conducted the officer to
the presence of Ronuano, who was sitting in
asrnall side room, in the center of. which
stood srtablecovered witha white linen cloth,
containing dishes: and victuals for their sup.'
pets. Bomano rose at the entrance 9f the
officer, extended his band in welcome, ,w
showd him to a seat at the table.

Every thingha.ving been so prepared as to
render assistance~ uranScessary, the servant
who had conducted the captain hither was
immediately dismissed, with order to remain
within hearing of tue bell. But servants
not unfrequently, when not permitted to go
as far as inclination prompts, remain much
nearer than is altogether desirable.
Thus the young man who was banished
froih the presence of his master and bisinas-
tet's guest, endeavored to pass the time em'.
ployed by them in snp~ing and conv~rsatlon
in taking some key hole notes. But owing to
a dullness of comprehension, he get bat a

reprovingly. "I had becOme qnite4impa~

'Well, and what is the present condition

"gow mau~ does Ambrosia's expedition

"I could not te1l,'~ replied the officer.-
"The escort consists of Captain Feron and
his musketeers, and about a score ot~ mounted
Rreicheroes under the ohakge of Juan Mor~

'But how many people-.--you can certainly
make a guesS?" taid I~oinauuo, impatiently.
"At least s~hundred," answered Barbata~
"The devils" exclaimed the merchant, sun~
poised. "Why, Who?"
"I know net- who all," replied the officer,
"there are at least thirty families represent.
"Who?-who?" cried t~oinanno eagerly.
"The families of Genres, Menehaea, (~hap.

"And is Maregnanara among t~e number?'
interrupted the merchant, anxiously.

feared."
"A hi indeedV' exclaimed the officer. "Why
what difference can she znakel"
"More than you can imagine," replied Re-
macno; but not wishing to be interrogated,
he quickly added an inquiry, that required an
answer and a change in the subject of com-
munication. "By wlmatmeans doyou expect
to detach her from thecompany?"
"Who, the widow?" inquired Barbata.
"No, curse the widow, and you too if you
don't forget her this moment," answered
Romanno. "I mean Andronita."
"Oh! I scarcely. know," replied the officer
"I think I have fQrined no plan as yet. I
shall endeavor toenlist t'eron in the matter.
He will go as far for money as I will for
revenge, and that you know is not a little

"fle is in love with old &amp;damont's daugli-:

Barbata.
"He is bet~rothed to hen, but in love with

"I can't admire his preference," said liar..
bata, "for Olinda is greatly the superior'."
"Say so where and when you will but in
my presence," returned the merchant, "Olin-
dais a superior woman when compared with
most Of hSe sex, but Andronita is withouta

"1 have thought of no other plan than the
subvention of Peron," and Captain Barbata,
resuming the subject in hand. "But if your
in&amp;~rmatlon is correct, some other must be
axed upon. Perhaps Mortior may be con-~
trolled?"
"Scarcely, if he is of Peron's comniand,"
answered BOnlanno.

"Prisoners!" exclaimed Romanno, truely
surprised. "Why, for what are they prison-
ers?"
"Is ltpossibleyou have not hear4?" replied
the officer. "They were this morning arres-
ted for hating assisted in the escape of Rod-
ament and that cursed American who spoil-
ed the beauty of my countenance."
"This is fortunate," said Romanno: "It
will enable na to manage the thing without
difficulty. A feigned attack upon Mortior's
command will bring Peron to his assistance.
when a rush among the women and children
will enable you to carry off Andronita."
"I do not altogether like the plan, for it is
attended with too much daK~ger," replied Bar-
bata. "I am of the opinion, that by joining
the party with the 4merican, I shall escape
suspicion; and having gained the confidence
of Peron and &amp;tortior, shall find little dUll"
culty in discovering an opportunity to carry
off Andronita during to-morrow night."
"Perhaps that will be better," ~aid Ro-
manno, thoughtfully. "At any rate, I see
notl4ng preferable at the present moment.-
But it is time we were under way, or they
wrn get toO much the start."
"No fear of that, for they must necessarily
travel slow," replie~l Barbata. But unless I
get the prisoner beyond the city to night, I
shall stand but a slim chance for revepge;-
Even if the Americans do not come and set
him at liberty, Ambrosia will protect him
against me until he is exchanged."
"Well, if you have finished your supper,
there is nothing to detain you," said Roman-
no. "The Men I promised to furnish, are in
the court ready to set out ata moments warn-
ing."
"Then, the sooner we are off the better,"
said Barbata, rising from the table.
"Where is the General's order?" inquired
Bomanno, with a smile.
"Here," answered the captain, touching
the breast of his coat opposite his waistcoat
pocket,
"Give it me," said Romanno.
Ba~bata deliberately unbuttoned his coat,
rejt in onepocket of his vest and then in the
other, then in both his trowacre pockets, but

F BRIDE; OR,
the order was in none of themat least it was
not found.
"I certainly put it in this pocket," he ra
marked, feeling again in the pocke which he
had first examined. "It is not here! I must
have lost it."
"That is very unfortunate," se~id Romanno,
quickly, "for it defeats all our purposes."
"It cau't effect them at all," replied Bar-
bata. "The ~order has done its work; it has
procured us the control of the prisoner."
"But it is a forgery, and if evil befals the
prisoner, will easily be detected, and the deed
may be fixed upon its rightful perpetrator,"
returned Romanno. "Though the signature
is good enough no deceive the prefect, Arista
would detect the imposition, for he would
know he never executed such an order. So,
through your carelessness both our plans are
frustrated, and our most cherished purposes
defeated."
"There is nothing to prevent the progreu
of our intentions," said Barbata,
"N~othing but the tess of the order~" re-
plied Romanno.
"That is a small matter," said the officer,
contemptuously.
"It involves my honor," said the merchant,
man excited tone, "and unless it is recover-
ed, nothing further shall be done. I can ef-
feet my purpose in some other way."
"It may be sticking in some corner of my,
pocket," said Barbata, renewing the exami-
nation.
It will be perceived from the foregoing
conversation, that the officer and merchant
had entered into an agreement, each to assist
the other in carrying out a favorite object.
The conditions of that agreement were brief-
ly, that Romauno, being an excelnt pensman
and acquainted with Arista' s signature,
should forge an order apon the city prefect
for the delivery of the American into the
custody of Barbata, and furnish a company
of fifty men to carry hire beyond the city to
a place of security; and for this service Bar-
bata was to sieze Andronita Rappello on hew
way to Victoria, and carry her off toward
the mountains, where Romanno should suds

denly cross his path, and rescue her from her
fancied danger,
Romanno purposed no wrr~ beyond the
mere abduction. He loved .&amp;ndronita-lov-
ed her almost to dis~rac~tion; but his love was
not reciprocated. Until he saw her, he had
loved the widow Cathedra; but the beautiful
widow had no chafins for his eyes after they
had once dwelt upon the angelic countenance
of the adorable Andronita.
It was on the day of Captain Leonard's
exhibition to the Mexican soldiery and popu-
lace, that he first beheld this lovely creature.
She was standing at the north end of the
widow's Balcony, in the half concealed atti-
ude described many pages back, and the tears
f compassion were trickling down her dim-
led cheeks, and falling softly, one after an-
ther, upon her heaving bosom. Jim atten~
on had been directed toward her by the ad-
iring gaze of the prisoner, and the discove-
y of such angelical sweetness and beauty
netantly inspired him with love for the mai-
en and hate for the unfortunate being whose
tuitionn had called forth her tears.
But scarcely had he discovered the lovely
n~#nita, when Mrs. Cathedra, who leaned
pon his arm, claimed his attention, and di-
ted it toward some object in quite a differ.
ot direction. Much against his desire he
implied with her request, but as soon as he
ould without attracting her notice and excit.
g her jealousy, turned his eyes again toward
e spot where he had seen the ethereal beau-
* But to his surprise and vexation, she
one, and before he could free himself from
e widow, she had left the mansion.
Romanno was too deeply enamored not to
ake some exertions to discover the object
his love, and he was not long in obtaining
a desired information, and what he prized
en more, an introduction. As already said,

But to his surprise~ .Audronita Rapello

tered. She described his hehavior as perU.
dious. She refused to hear a contrast be~
tween he~ own and the wid~w's beauty. She
told him plainly that if he was not bound t.
another lady the sacred promise of matrinno-
nialallianceshe could not love him. In abort,
she repulsed him winhreproaches, and threat-
ened to discover his faithlessness to his be
trothed.
]1~~manno insisted that it was not his fault
that he admired her beauty; any other person
must have done as much. Of conree he was
to blame for having confessed his foolish love;
but he was impetuous, and the hope of win.
ning ~o fair an angel ought to excuse even
a greater indiscretion. He begged that she
would not expose this love passage, but on
the contrary give it consideration; he had the
vanity to hope if she could realize the depth.~
of his love, she would regard him with favor.
To all of which the maiden replied, that.
the charaeler of his love could make no dif-
ference with her, because she loved another
But to his inquiries concerning her love, and
more particularly if it was reciprocated, she.
refused an answer.
Romauno found it impossible to elicit an~j
thing beyond her ingenuous confidence. 0
other persons he made inquiry, but gained n~
information which could assist him to a rolls
ble conclusion. Among the youth of tha
city, many had heard of her beauty, but until
the day of Captain Leonard's exhibition, n~
one had ever beheld her, so carefully had she
been guarded from their gaze, in the quiet of:
her rural nome.
The merchant was of the opinion, that if~
hecould render her some signal service, it
would make such a deep impression on her~
mind, that gratitude would assist her in the
accomplishment of his purpose.. And with
this object in view, he entered into the agree-
ment with Barbata.
On the ~ther hand, the. officer, lent upon

In security.
While he lingered, doubting, the shadow
of a person passed alopg the ground before

This order Ituparted scarcelygr~at~r plea-.

ricans. There were some directions from
General Ta$or~ respecting Captai~ Leonar4,
but as ha was ~Iready at li~~ty~hey are of
little conaequen~e.
As soon as all these fade were published,
preparations were made, and the parties se..-
parated; Peron, with those under his charge,
journeying forward, and Mortior taking
charge of those who returned, Each party
reached its destination withoUt unusual trou-
ble or deisy, though it was nearly midnight
when the latter arr~ived.
A~ this party approached Matamoras, a
circ~inrntancO occurred that caused some ap.
prehension. They were challenged by the
American pickets, stationed near the ruin of
an old fort, a short distance south of the
city. Great excitement prevailed, and but
for Olinda, *bo explained the challenge to
Mortior, dispersion and flight would have
ensued.
The sentinel oir duty at this post, charged
with strict orde~~s*hich be dare not disobey
called for the officer in charge of the picket
guard, giving his number, which indicated
his position, an4 enabled the offleer, whoever
be happened to he when the call reached his
ears, to proceed directly to the post from
which tJie alarm proceeded.
The next sentinel, on each hand, repeated
the words, and in a very few minutes, the
otUcer arrive~i. A few words from Olinda
explained everything, and all save Mortior
and his command were suII~rcd to pass.
'These, by order of General Taylor, were die.
armed, but permitted to return to their
homes~
This little circumstance, so dithrent from
anything they had expected, notwithstanding
the assuranCe of the prefect, inspired cone-
denee and respect. And this confidence and
respect were never forfeited, although the
three mouths' t~6lunteers culled into service
by GeneralGaines, did very many thingeoct

out removing t~relr apprehension; for they
had scarcely less to fear from guerillas, large
partiesof whom infested that region of Ta-
maulipas, and plundered all who were not
strong enough to make successful resistance.
The commander of the approaching party2
$serving the warike attitude of the other,
called a halt~ and dispatched a messenger to
communicate with Captain Peron; it proved
to be Romanno and his lahorers~ whom he
had arAed to make sum the capture of An.
dronita. With the mention of one other
fact, the merchant will be left to explain his
presence and the armed condition of his
people, as shall accord with his mativesof
propriety.
The night upon which he and Barbata had
ooncoct~d a plan for the capture of Andre.
nitnand the destruction of the American, as
soon as the latter had departed, he called to
iris servant and gave orders for his rancheros
to prepare for the march.
A little before daybreak he left the city,

and by a circuitous route, gained a designate .

tidings. 8o weencamped for the night, re.

light enough to discover the course pursued

the robbers had disp~rs~d, and every one
taking a course of their own, no trace was
left 1y which we might even guess their ren--
deivous. After several fruitless attempts to
fix upon their course, the pursuit was ahan--
doned.
"Shortly 4ter a' solitary footman was
observed farther down the valley, and a cou.-
plc of men were dispatched to inquire of him
respecting the guerila. But as soon as he
noticed their approach, he turned and fled
at the top of his speed; whereupon I imme-
diately' ordered a general pursuit.
"The fugitive bent his' course toward the
hills,,and so rapid was his flight, that our
utmost exertions were not sufficient to pre-
vent the attainment of his object. A score
of my followers at once dismounted, and con--
tinned the chase on foot, but their best ef--

taking.

cleared at a bound, with the ease and grace
of the mountain goat. Prom rpcks that
crumbled beneath his weight, he would leap
to a firmer foothold. And by means of
shrubs not strong enough to support one half

pleasure, and u~ith perfect s&amp;,urity
"Perceiving the impossibility of his cap.
tune by direct pursuit, I ordered those of my
iollo~ers who were on horseback, to ascend
the valley for half a league, and then dis--
mouxit and intercept his course. The move~
ment was successful,!though an hour and up.
wards were consumed in the effort. But the
capture was worth the exertion
This narrative was made lathe presence
of all those under Peron's protection, and
was listened to with lively interest.

Who is the captain I" inquired Perom~
eagerly.
"Captain Leonard," replied R~manno.
An hour before the widow Cathedra bad
expressed her joy at the American's escape:
but her accustomed cheerfulness had scarcely
returned before he was again in their midst.
At the mention of his name she shrieked and
shuddered as if she really felt the4ear she
affected. Romanno flew to her Eide and en--
deavored to allay her apprehensions.
"My love," said he, "be not afraid, he is
bound."
"Your love," cried the widow, forgetting
the part sh. was playing in her eagerness
to manif~'st her indignation, "how dare you
address me in such terms, after what has
transpired ?"
"I must, beg to be enlightened before I
can answer," returned the merchant.
"Its very easy to affect Ignorance," said
the widow, angrily, "but it don't always
answer the purpose intended."
"I am not conscious of having done
anything to merit your displeasure," said
Romanno.
" it nothing to violate your troth--
plight?" demanded Mrs. Cathefira, with in--
creased anger.
"I do assure you," began the merchant-.-
"I will hear none of~your assurances," in-
terrupted the widow. "I have listened to
too many already for my own peace of
mind."
"If you would but listen a moment," en-
treated Ro4ltnno, "everything would be ex-
plained to y~ur satisfaction."
"To what would you have me listen ?"
cried the beauty fiercely. "To a confession
of your own guilt? To an avowal ~f your
own perfidy? To an acknowledgment of
your own disgrace ?"
"I know not how or what to answer," said
the merchant, growing impatient. "A little
reason instead of so much excitement might
enable us to come to an understanding.
"0, Velasques Romanno I" cried the
widow. "I could never bare suspected you
of such perfidy. I shall never put my trust
in man."

"You have heard ~ falsehood;' said the
merchant. "Barbata has lied upon me, and
prepi~red a noose for his neck."
"It will be of no consequence then," said
the angry widow, except in the hands of the
resurrectionist."
"What do you mean 1" asked Bo~nanno
quickly. Captain Leonard had refused t.
'~onverse, and he was ignorant of the fate~of
his accomplice.
"Barbata is dead, as he ought to be," said
Mrs. Lfathedra; "and be is in his grave,

"Dea4 or alire," cried the excited mar.-
~bant, "he is a liar and a scoundrel."

turned the widow; "but in neither respect

It is not strange thOn, thut the gloomy ~..

many events which had mark~'d the history
of Mexico, in other days. The old castle

abledto ascert~In from a small aperture at
one side of his cell, through which a faiti

sinsak of light was enabled to penetrate.
With the night, came thoughts of escape,
and he arose from his hardcouch in order
to scan the appearance of things about him.
He had at different times during his lmpri~
sonment in Mexico, discovered some of the
many secrets of their architects, and hell~ti~
doubted, but that there were some secret
springs connected with his dungeon, besid~
the one at which he had entered. With these
thoughts in his mind he arose to hie feet audi
conunence~l a diligent survey of the apart.
merit. After spending near an half an hour
in search, which proved unsuccessful, he was
about to relinquish all further effort when
his eye was arrested by the sight of a small
hole perforated in the solidmasonry at one
side 01' the apartment. At any other time
this might have failed to attract his atten-
tion, but so firmly was he bent upon effect-
lug hii escape, that this slight ~iireurn~tance
convinced him that his first Impressions in
regard to a secret outlet, were not without
foundation.
With these thoughts in his mind, be
looked around the sp~rtment for some
pointed instrument with which to prove the
ralystery. In this he was successful; a few
steps frost the spot, he discovered a some-
what curiously shared nail, which had evi-

rushing intothe ipartnstht, which ho *us at

whose duty it was to alu~iply him with food,
and taking It Lu his hand, strode back to
the secret outlet. One moment more, and

butwas positively prevented by the sound
of foot-steps approaching his prison: With
a quick movement he stepped back and drew
the open door toward himwhich closed with
a creaking noise, just as the door on the other
side was thrown open to adnut theguard,
who supplied him with food and w~t~r. As-
suming an air of composure that he ~did pot
by any means feel, Captain Leonard; turned
to the man who was evidently much sur-
prleed at the appearance Qf the prisoner with
his lamp in his hand.
"Captain Leonard is astir Jate," remarked
the guard eyeing th~ prisoner closely.

willingly place themselves in contact with
the dreaded scourgee of the Rio Grand." In
this state of mind he mused over the many
prominent events of his past life. Lieute-
nant Ricardo was born near the city of Val-.
ladolid on the river Dour~, His parents
were not wealthy, but in respectable circum~
stances. They lived by the management and
culture of the grape. At an early age
Lieutenant Bicardo had expressed a desire to
enter the ranks oi the army, and as his father
had been in his younger days a soldier in the
service et his country, his inclinations were
not opposed. Accordingly the youuget
Ricardo entered the service in, the private
ranks. In the course of time, he was promo-
tedand upon hissubsequentarrival inMexico
received the Commission of, Lieutenant from
8auta Anna, by embracing the cause of that
ostensible noblemen. Of his quarrel and
~nco~nter with the now-bandit chieftain
before quitting Spain, the reader has already
been informed in the wordp of Cawile himself,
when explaining his motives to his prisoners,
so nothing further uced be paid in order to
introduce things, in their proper light.
Lieutenant Ricardo was now convinced that
by some means the commander-in-chief had
been induced to betray him into the power of
of his old enewy, and he partly accounted for
it in the following manner. At the present
stage of the struggle between ~the United
l~tates and Mexico it was well known that
'the forces of the latter were some-what di.
mished by the recent disasters at Palo Alto
and Resaca de la Palms, for the great force
that was afterwards concentrated at Buena

'much on the assistance of Clamile, in carrying
forward the 'assassin..like warfare which he
was then waging against his more open and
generous enemy. From these circumstances
Lieutenant Ricardo was induced to believe
that Santa Anna, in order to retain the aid
and good-will of the formidable ranchero.
had betrayed him into the hands of his mast
deadly enemy. The hours passed over, but
the Lieutenant knew not whether day or
night reigned over the world without,, for it
brought no visible changewithin his prison-.--
all was damp and gIoowy~. Feeling wearied,
he laid down in one corner of his cell, where
a small quantity of. straw had been place~,
and in a shorttinre his deep breathing ar~noun.
cad that he was asleep. ~ot long afterward, a
slight rattling noise was heard at one side of
the apartment, and ,the next instant a heavy
door creaked on its hinges, and admitted the
form of Camile, or as he was firat introduced
to our readers~Guy Retries He weedressed
in the sante sty4 as before, and the same
demoniac smile ~rcsted on his dark and sun-
browned features.
"Ua? sleepingi" muttered he between his'
clenched teeth. "But 'tis well-4or me thinks
'twill be his last upon earth. Ricardo-m.ray

than ~ali, she complimented him highly on
behalf of his beard, which she had describ'e4
to some persons; under o4her circumstances,
as ugly, frightful, hideous~ detestable.
Meanwhile many changes had taken place.
Aiphouso and Olinda had daily advanced in
love, and Captain Peron would not have
been indifferent to this growing attachment,
if his thoughts bad not been otherwise ezn.-
ployad, and his a$mtions otherwise engaged.
From Victoria he returned immediately on
having discharged his duty, and since he
came back had done but little else than
make love to Andronita.
As to Captain Leonard he had inquired of
Olirida, who the maiden was that commis-'
serated his sufferings with tears osi the day
of his.exhibition~ but Olinda did not know.
He asked Mrs. Romano, and she did not
know.
"Do you know a maiden whose. name is
Rapello ?" inquired the Captain, surprised
to think no one had witnessed the tears that
controlled his destiny.
Captain Leonard did not know that his
sympathiser and deliverer were identical; 'he
felt thatthey must beand that was all. One
he had seen, and her tears; the other be had
heard, and by herr assistance had gained his
liberty, and eventually saved his life. Ba-
pello was the name of his delivere"r; she de-
served his thanks; and then ~he might be the
object of his search.
"Yes," replied Olinda. "Mr. Ambrosia's
niece is so named---Andronita Rapello; but
surely it is not alma you mean ?"
"It may 'be," said Mrs. Romano, "she
was at my house the day the monster was
shown," This was said playfully and was
accompanied with.a smile.
"It cannot be," said Olinda. "She is
but a child; I mean in years, for she is a
sage in thought. I love her dearly, for she
Is a true woman. And she' is kind, but not
tender; I never saw her weep, if she could,

"The girl I mean is tall, straight, slender,

Leonard. "U ~r hnir hangs about her neck

is exceedingly handsome, and htr Ibatures

"Yes, and perfectly," answered' Olinda.
"But I am astonished she never wept before'

have suffered in contemplating' human
misery, never did it manifest itself in this
wise She is a strange compound-soft and

ture to be the woman in all things; yet, if
occasion require, she can act a manly part,
if that part is heroic."
"I know another after this sort," said
Captain Leonard. He would have added
something more, if he had not been inter-
rupted.
"She may be of this sort," said Olinda,
quietly. understanding whomhe meant, "but
a very feeble type of the character, which
Andronita so completely represents."
"Do you know Miss Rodamont, that I
greatly admire what I have seen of this
young lady ?" inquired the American.
"She would be dull indeed who did not
suspect as much from your conversation,"
replied Olinda.        /

tion in my favor of that heroic manliness
which you say constitutes the under current

ard.
"Ido not," replied Olinda.
"Then she has not told-you ?" asked- the
Captain, surprised.'
"She has told me nothing," answered
Olinda. "What was there to tell ?"
Did it never occur to your mind to inquire
how'the thongs of the prisoner come to be
severed on that particular night ?" said the
Amerjcan.
"Yes, and often too, t~en'and since," re-
plied Olinda. '~ And alow I can comprehend

THE MEXICAN BRIDE; OR,

why Andronita was so composed in the
midst nf the tumult, so collected amid the
distraction."
"Is she so very young as she appears?'
inquired the Captain;
"She is but eighteen," replied Olinda
"Eighteen 1" repeated the American.
A pause ensued Captain Leonard re-
flected. Olinda~and the widow observed his
thoughtfulness; they glanced at each other,
but neither spoke. The pause was brief,
and was broken by the Captain, who talked
to himself. abstractedly.
"Eighteen I" he repeated. "There is a
great discrepancy; is it 00 much ?"
The Captain, it wil be observed, by the
reader, wa~ compa ing the maiden's age
with his own; hut Olinda understood the
language as applying wholly to Andronita.
"You think, then," said she, "that her
appearance is younger than herself?"
"I think," said the Captain, blushing, as
he recollected his language, "that there is a
slight discrepancy; she looks to be no more
than sixteen."
"It is her flexible form and transparent
complexion that gives her so youthful an
appearance," said Olinda. "She is more
the woman than she seems."
"Eighteen!" repeated the captain. "In
that many years women mostly pass through
'~bree distinct phases of existence-the days
of infancy, the days of instruction, and the
days of flirtation. What is Andronita's
history ?"
"In the first period she lost her parents,
and found a home with the kind-hearted Am-
brosia, the second period was spent in San
Louis Fotosi, and has just concluded; the
third, therefore, has not yet elapsed, and
I think I may promise Captain Leonard a
share in the' pleasures-" It was thus Olinda
answered.
At the moment, Captain Leonard gave
her concluding words but little attention;
afterward, however, then he recalled them,
and the look by which they were accompa.'
nied, they seemed to have a significance
which he had entirely overlooked. But

what t~iey could mean he could not well cot
jecture.
With this subject uppermost in his mind,
he set out that afternoon for the residence os
Andronita. The Alcalde lived on the Texas
side of the Rio Grande, about five miles
from Matamoras- He owned a large tract
of land, upon which lived some four-score
families, whose rude dwellings were clustered
together under the name of San Augustine.
His own house was a large adobe builPing,
fronting toward the north; the roof covered
*ith fiat tiles, forming a promenade, and
protected by a ballustrade the height of a
woman elbow. Behind the house was a
spacious garden, surrounded by a wall of
brick, and full of tropical trees--orange,
lemon, lime, fig, citroh, tamarind, palm, and
pommegr&amp;nate.
At San Augustine Captain Leonard had
a warm reception. Ambrosia, though not
a great, was a good man. He was glad to
see the American; he said so, and a goon
man utters no falsehood. His manner was
kind and demonstrative, and his language
flattering. The Captain was accustomed to
compliments, and could return them; and on
this occasion he did, mingled with repeated
thanks. They discussed, in a very friendly
manner, all the little incidents, pleasant and
unpleasant, which had transpired since the
Flying Cloud put into the Rio Grande for
shelter from the storm.
An allusion to this circumstance induced
the Captain to inquire the fate of his vessel,
which had been confiscated. This fact he
knew, and had known for weeks; but he
also knew that the schooner, unless by pur-
pose or accident destroyed, was somewhere
in the waters of Mexico. Ambrosia had
the required information, and he gratified
the inquirer. The Flying Cloud was .~
Alvorado.
After this conversaIi~~ Ambrosia pro.
posed a walk, and he and ~ gnest strolled
out into the village, to look at the people
and their dwellings. Captain Leonard felt
but little interest in either; nevertheless he
listened patiently to all that Ambrosia had
to say respecting them. It is written pa.

THE RANGER'S REVENGE.

gently, and patiently it wits so far as appear-
inces was concerned, but patiently it was
iot in reality. Captain Leonard, though
,is manner evinced anything else, was ex-
sedingly anxious to return.
At length the round was accomplished.
rlreir steps were about to be retraced; they
Lad turned their face toward the mansion,
in the top of which Captain Le9nard dis-
inctly saw two persons, the one a man,. aud
lie other a woman. He was too far off to
lietinguish, but he felt that one was A.ndro-
ita, Bud the other a suitor. The tonight
sade him miserable. Re began inwardly to
Leplore his fate; he regretted that he had
eft Matamoras, for there he could have
honked Ambrosia, as well as at his own
Louse. But this was not the object of his
isit, though he intimated as much to the
~Icalde, and tried to deceive his own mind
etothe same belief.
Before they had proceeded many steps,
he twain upon the house-top descended out
f eight, and who the gentleman was, he was
eft to conjecture. On their return to the
ouse, Ambrosia conducted his guest to the
ining-room, where tea was prepared. Mrs.
~inbrosia, a very agreeable, lady-like, ma..
ronly woman of fifty, having in this respect
sine ten years the advantage of her good,
husband, (whose hair was quite gray with
he frosts of sixty,) was the hostess on this
cession.
The conversation turned upon books and;
authors, and those of Spanish origin were
chiefly discussed. The Captain was fami-
ar with many such, 'and the conversation
us agreeable. Still he could not but think
ow much more pleasant it would be to con-
erse on these topics with one who belonged
nder that roof, yet was not present. He
ad but a small appetite, on that occasion
ad it was easily satisfied; the meal was
On dispatched.
After supperVAmbrosia proposed a walk
his garden. But scarcely had they got
every beyond the door, when the Alcalde's
presence was required at the front of the
suse. He excused himself, told the Captain
follow the main walk, and promising to
6

join him presently, hastened away to obey
the summons-
Captain Leonard followed the directions
until he reached the termination of the walk,
where he waited some minutes for his cora.
panion and guide. But growing weary, he
turned out into a narrow side path, which
wound away to another and more distant
portion of the garden. As he walked along,
musing, he heard human voices close-at hand
and directly in front of him. The speakers
were concealed from view, but he inst~antly
recognized the voices of Andronita and Capt.
Peron.
"In that you are greatly mistaken," said
the latter.
"I do not irnow that I am," replied the
former.
"I have not forsaken Olinda." said the
officer.
"Then why are you not with her ?" in.
quired the, maiden.
"She has forsaken me," returned Peron.
"And you came hither because forsaken?"
said Andronita, disdainfully.
"There is nothing on earth so dear that I
would not forsake for your sake," said the
officer; "but I have been obliged to forsake
not and therefore guiltless of the supw
posed perfidy."
"Guiltless inact, certainly; but not guilt,.
less in thought and will to do the deed had
it been necessary, if what you\say is true"
rejoined Andronita.
"Incorrigible creature! why will you thus
willfully pervert everything I ntter ?" cried
Peron, with impatience and-vexation.
"Because I do not believe the half," an~.
swerved the maiden, frankly but severely.
"But you must believe," returned the
officer, with a strong accent upon the aux~
iliary.
"How can I 7" demanded Andronit.
quickly. "You are betrothed to Olinda.
and the engagement Is not broken, nor do

who could prefer another to Olinda

"Andronita," said the officer, with in-
ereased firmness, "I have now let you go on,
until lam wearied."
"I am heartily glad of It," answered the
maiden quickly; "perhaps I shall have less
trouble In future."
"I say I am wearied," repeated the officer
impatiently. "You must decide this mat-
terliere and at once."
"Captain Peron," replied the maiden,
earnestly, "on two other occasions~l have
bid you as plainly as language could tell,
that I would never be your wife; and you
persist to no purpose. This I have also told
my uncle, who favors your suit, in spite of
your engagement with Oliuda; the Only
thing I ever knew him to do that did not
meet the world's approbation. He once
hinted at services rendered him by your
father, and I can account for his strange
demeanor toward yourself and me en nO
other ground than gratitude. But I con-
ceive that the deeds of your father, however
much they may have~ heriefitted my uncle, is
no reason why the niece of the latter should
become the wife of the former's son-aside
from every other consideration."'
"And do you adhere to this determine.
tion ?" said the officer in a low but firm
voice?' "Reflect before you answer."
"If I could have had my way, I had been

In this camp, as might be supposed, there
was very little discipline. In truth, Peron
hims~if was seldom there. Most of his time
was spent at Saint Augustine and Matamo-
ras, thenglz n theli~tter place he always wore
a disguise. Of course he was known to
his acquaintances, but by the Americans,
could hot be distinguished from any other
stranger of the republic.
It was In his camp where he planned the
abduction of Andronita. And every neces-
sarything was so completely arranged, that
he must have succeeded but for the timely
Interferenceof Captain Leonard.
But he was not a man to be thwarted with
Impunity. He was of a determined mind, and
of a vengeful disposition. He loved adven-
ture, and always preferred the post of
danger.
His misadventure in Ambrosia's garden,
Ired him with revenge. He returned with
his men to their camp, and there concocted
another plan to secure the forcible posses-
sion of the damsel, as well as one for the des-
truction of her deliverer.
Both failed, however; and the latter re-
~ulted talus recognition, and well nigh in his
arrest. The assassination was atte1n~ted in
a billiard-room, kept by Angelo Oliva, an
Italian, by whom it was happily prevented.
It ~as after night, and the assassin, by
means of the darkness, effected his escape.
One of his men, however, was caught and
sent to the ~Mexican prison; but he was die.
charged in the course of a few days, no one
appearing to prosecute.
The second attempt to' kidnap Andronita,
also' failing, Peron grew more deterrnine4,
and resolved to storm the Inansion. But
Ambrosia fearing such an event, obtained
permission from the cousnaridant of the post
atMatamoras, to arm a certain nuniber o~
his ~anc1rero~ for the defense of his flimily.
Ne~ of this preparation having reached
Peron, he concludedthat It would be unsafe
to niake the contemplated attack, sod it was
thei~efore abandoned. But other means were
Iwhediately adopted toaccomplish the same
ptitpOs~.
Meanwhile time elapsed, and other events

transpired. Captain Leonard had becoaw
a frequent and welcome visitor at the house
of the alcalde, and the accepted lover of his
beautiful niece, with the approval of her
friends.
More than this. A day was fixed for their
nuptials, and a messenger had heen dis.
patched to Victoria for a bishop, who waste
perform the ceremony;, and this high digni-
tary was daily expected.
Among the first informed of these things,
was Olinda Bodamont, who visited Saint
Augustine at the request of, Andronita, to
remain with her until after the nuptial ce-
remony.
During the interval she received a parti-.
cular account of Captain PeronYs behavior
toward his niece, which afforded her an
additional proof of his gross perfidy toward
herself.
Olinda was not an angel, and much as she
loved Andronita, she could not forgive the
officer the preference manifested for her friend
although she herself loved another.
Almost daily Captain Leonard rode over
te the mansion of the al~alde, and Alphonse
not infrequently bore him company. On
one occasion the following conversation
transpired.
"Has anything been heard of Captain Pe-
ron ?" inquired Alphonso.
"Nothing reliable," answered the Ameri-
can. "A company of traders, from New
Leon. reported to have seen him at Riconada
Pass; but I am inclined to discredit the
account."
"And I should unless I knew the narrt~tor

"He is a merchant, from Cadareyta, highly
respected in the city where he lives, and fa.

Matamoras;by whom his story is credited,"
replied Captain Leonard. "But all these

Afraid to fire, lest in his effort to kill Pc-
ron he might destroy his wife, Captain Leon-
ard thrust the pistol back into his bosom,
struck his spurs deep into the sides of his
horse, and exerted every nerve to overtake
the fugitive. But the attempt was useless,
for his own beast, though swifter than the
Other for a certain distance, was not capable
of as much ~fatigue and endurance; and the
space between them, which until now had
gradually diminished, began to increase with
fearful rapidity.
[n this extremity, Captain leonard again
plucked the pistol from his bosom, and le-
veiled it at the fugitive; but the drooping
body of his wife, again thrust between the
wI~im ano his danger, paralyzed the finger

that pressed the trigger, and the weapon an~&amp;
hand fell heavily by his side together. Bnt
the next moment both were again raised, and
the contents of another barrel discharged~
but not at the politic villain, who was armed
with a shield more effectual than brass or
iron; but at his tireless steed, which received
the load in its head, and reared and plunged,
and at length fell down in the agonies of.
death.
In the fall, Andronita and Peron became
separated. The former, who had fainted, as
soon as she found herself in the arnie of her
rejected lover, lay on the ground senseless
~ short distance from the dying beast. But
Peron quickly regaining his feet, drew his
sword and rushed upon Captain Leonard,
who had leaped from his horse to protecthis
bride. The American still held in his hand
the pistol from which he had already five
times discharged a messenger of death: and
it yet contained another, which the next mo-
mont, was deeply lodged in the breast of his
lawless rival.
In a little time, several of the officers ar-
rived, and afforded their triumphant country.
man such assistance as the emergency re-
quired. Andronita was conveyed to her
uncle's mansion and by the help of suitable
medicaments, was in a little while restored to
consciousness. But in consequence of this
interruption, and the many deaths it had
occasioned, thirteen of the musketeers having
shared the fate of their commander, the wed.
ding ball, which was to have come off that
night at the splendid mansion of Velasques
Rornanno, was deferred until the following.
After the departure of the guests, most of
whom returned to the city that evenIng~ the
rancheros wore dispatched to collect and
bury the dead bodies of Peron and his ill~~
fated followers, and to administer to the re-
lief of the wounded, who were unable to ce-
cape, of whom the number embraced nearly
one third of the company.
