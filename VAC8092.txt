JENK1NS,   MUTTERINGS AND MUSINGS OF  AN  INVALID-. OH DEAR, another miserable, worthless day before me. How long is this, loathsome farce to last? How long am I doomed to drag this contemptible carcass about the earth? How many more weary months must I linger here, a eye-sore to my friend a nuisance: to myself? When, oh when; will the blessed day of release come, -that I may go .down quietly to my grave, and .be resolved intp my kindred dust? Why, why was I ever pemitted:to see (day-light? What right had my  n'thking parents to, inflict upon society such a wretch as I am? Yes, 'twere far better for all concerned, that ;I were out of the way-the sooner the better--let me go then-box me up-1.pack; metoff-send me home-home, to nmy mother earthwithout parade towrth has few vain. wojrd as. posi blo  -!et:,.ie drop off, unheeded as a falling leaf. But-- some hale and: hearty looking friend ,will enter presently, 1*   10      MUITTERINGS AND picking his teeth, perhaps, after a substantial break- fast, and tell me that I am wrong, quite wrong, in feeling and talking thus--that it is ungrateful, sin- ful-that it is mere chicken-hearted whining-an unmanly shrinking from the wholesome trials, the needful discipline of life. Sir, I am not convinced- nor do I like the dictatorial tone of your remarks. Grumble I will-it is the sick man's privilege. , I uwish to know why I am tormented thus? What vile offence must my poor soul have committed in some pre-existent state, that it, has thus been con- "demned to ignominious imprisonment in such a pitiful humbug of a body as this--look at me- 'what a lantern-jawed, guinea-visaged, hollow-eyed scarecrow have I become-a mere bag of sorry -bones. Why, if I were cast ashore on a Cannibal 'island to-morrow, no respectable native would con- descend to eat me. Were I in a den of lions, I should feel perfectly safe, without faith; they would scorn to lay their royal paws on such a paltry more sel. 'See that infernal, rascally, impertinent, truth- 'telling looking-glass; with what a quiet malice it confirms my statements--vile reminder of my 'wretchedness, let me dash it into ten thousand atoms--yes, let me hurl it at the head of that ob- streperous wretch who is even now crying sand   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.   t   " tinder my windows--what a ragged, rugged. looking dog he is-what a solid-legged, broad-backed, im' pudent scoundrel-such a pair of lungs, too. Now is it not too bad, that I should be penned up here, like a bit of wax-work in a museum, and that this noisy, unprincipled vagabond should be as free as air? Curse my unlucky stars! Patience, patience, patience, my dear boy, think of poor old Job, and his patriarchal sufferings- studded with boils, tormented by a vixen of a wife, teased and insulted by hypocritical visitors-what are your experiences, compared with his? think of that, and so possess thy soul, and gulp down thy pills in patience.                   Pills, forsooth! have I not been gulping them down continually, for the last quarter of a century? hundreds of thousands of them, of all sorts, sizes and denominations? Blue, Life, Health, Dinner, Assa- foetida, Paradise Pills? I verily believe that I have tossed down more of these balls into my stomach, than there were votes polled at the last federal election--yes more than there were ever confetti thrown, at the gayest Carnival of Rome. I have no doubt that at this moment they are sticking %bout in the' coats of my stomach, thicker than 3apers on a leg of mutton-pills, say you? ay, and   12      MUPlEIKINGS AND powders too-have I not swallowed powders enough toimake a first-class sand-bank? Have I not swilled down saline and bitter draughts, enough to float the navy of Europe? name to me, if you can, a dough;drop that I have not tried; a cough candy 'that I have not sucked-or any gum, paste, root, syrup, tincture, that has not crossed the threshold of my stomach-Wintergreen, Camomile, Valerian, Habirhound, Liverwort, Sarsaparilla, have I not sued to them all in vain? Have I not bowed down and worshipped at the shrines, first of Allopathy, then of Homieopathy, and finally, of Hydropathy?  Have I not all summer long been soaking in wet  sheets, and tossing down multitudinous tumblers of  Croton? Have I not crouched down in sitz baths  of all temperatures? what part of my poor carcass  has not been a target for the contents of douche- pipes of all calibers? and has it not turned out a sovereign, a stupendous humbug:?  Water-cure,  forsooth I Why the first great water experiment of all, the Deluge itself,.did not-effect a cure; for who does not 'feel it, in his very bones, to! be true, that 3 the world is just as full of scamps, and quacks, and i sots, and; riffians, as" it was before the Flood? 'We, well,  well we-let;: me compose myself-let me  see if a cup of tea, and the morning paper cannot,  jl   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      13 between them, bring me down to a more rational, Christian frame of mind. Heavens I what a mon- ster sheet-it is really a job to fold it--why six irritable fellow-citizens might read abreast here, without any excuse for growling or hustling. If it keeps growing at this rate, the Times will soon be a mere chicken alongside of it; and as to those poor little starvelings that they call Journals in France, and Austria. and Italy, they sink into absolute nothingness. What says the editor? "We present to our readers," &c., "unwieldy as it may seem, we assure them that it is quite too small to be a faithful mirror of the world's doings, or an adequate ex- ponent of the wants of our vast, momently growing, and ever dearly beloved Gotham"-you say truth, no doubt, most amiable of pen-wielders-the world's doings, indeed-no trifle, they, ,in our day-how vast, how manifoldl Has there ever before been such a stir and bustle in this planet of ours? Can it be, that our brethren in the other orbs of space are so full of business? if so, what an active, enter- prising universe it must be. How proud we ought to be to belong to it! Why, here there is seare. a corner left for the meditative man-the philosopher can scarce find a quiet day, or quiet night, .whJereT to pursue his speculations.; asfor the poor pooe, th    i14 M- UT"i'ERkINGS AND jig is clearly up with him; he may as well hang his harp upon the willows forthwith, or take it to the, nearest pawnbroker's shop-he must no longer "Murmur near the running brooks A music sweeter than their own;"- both-brook and poet are looked upon by the com- munity with a jealous eye--the former must .no longer be permitted to prattle and loiter amongst groves and meads, but must be cut short in its course, and pressed into the service of Mammon-as to the latter, let him take refuge instanter in peddling or book-keeping, if he would dodge the operation of the vagrant act-public opinion will not be trifled with--and public opinion hath voted " calm contem- plation and poetic ease" to be intolerable nuisances, as much so, as intramural burying, or bone-boiling. Drop your books, then, my young friend-suspend your rambles--leave the lily on its stem, the Shak- peare on its shelf, and come and join the great con- gregation of Workers-come, help us plough and plant and sow and reap and dig and build and chop and spin and grind-fear not, there is work enough and to spare, for the whole of us-yes, for the whole nH e hundred millions  see what herculean labors we are already engaged in, and have out out for our   MUSINGS OF AN INVTA, T).     15 children and childrens' children--tapping lakes, cut- ting across isthmuses, scooping out harbors, putting rivers in- trim for business, drilling holes through mountains, ransacking the bowels of the earth for gold and silver, undermining whole States for fuel, chasing whales from ocean to ocean, sending forth our packs of steam-hounds to scur- the earth by sea and land, plucking out the heart of its mystery from either pole, holding wire-talks with the antipodes, turning the great globe itself into a huge whispering gallery-surely these are laudable, and most appro- priate tasks for human wits and nerves-most true- but, meanwhile, are there no other departments of thought and action? Is theology to go by the boards? are metaphysics to be forgotten? are the higher mathematics to be abandoned to the angels? May we no longer chop logic as well as wood? are the flowers of rhetoric to wither on their stalks? Is jurisprudence to be deprived of her fair-proportions? Is science only to be valued, as she may minister to our comfort? Is Art herself to forget all that is lofty and holy in her calling, and to become a mere turnspit in the service of Appetite? Heaven forbid -and yet, while we all cheerfully admit, in theory, the supremacy of things spiritual, are we not de- voting the great mass of. our time, thought, and   X-MUTTCRINGS AND mians' tot hig materiaml?. turning, our back upon the lubstancej while hasinb the teazing, deceiving, and tormenting shadow? But I forget myself- what:business has a poor cripple, like me, to indulge in these vain speculations? Has not the doctor ex- pressly tabooed. all such entertainments-ay, all approach to anything like argument, or even medi- tation? :My great occupation, he says, ought to be, to keep this infernal blood of mine from mounting up and iboling .in my brain-pan, and to resort to every possible contrivance for coaxing and forcing it down towards my heels-delightful employment! Hurrah, then for the hair gloves and the flesh-brush, after which, a cheerful, graceful turn or two with the dumb-bells. Better to day--I find it a relief to record my sen- sations;, and to give imy thoughts and whims an oc- casional airing-yes, I am worth full ten such poor devils as I was yesterday, and almost begin to think I Tmay yet live to be called venerable. How would a course of sparring lessons'suit me? BRough sport for an invalid--no, I hhave:hardly physical capital enough for that line of business-and yet there is     MUSINGS OF. AN INVALTT.   something very fascinating about it-so dignified, so heroic, too I I have a sneaking kind of admiration for prize-fighters-I took, I fear, an inexcusable de. gree of interest in the great Hyer and Sullivan en- counter-perhaps we sickly, feeble fellows are too apt to look with a sort of idolatry at these magnifi- cent specimens of muscular development, and are not sufficiently alive to their moral and intellectual short-comings-true, and yet it is a "glorious thing to have a giant's strength"-ay, a delightful thing to be able to trot along comfortably, with a barrel of flour under each arm; or, in a moment of right- eous indignation, rapidly and scientifically, to lay low a score or two of insolent hackmen, This is certainly a great deal more than Dr. Channing could have done, at any period of his career-he was a champion of a different stamp-in the matter of physical force, he was not worth a pinch of snuff- a small boy could have floored him with ease-but oh,. what a Titan with his pen-I was just reading a fine passage in his remarks on Fenelon. How many writers are there on the globe at this moment, who can construct so exquisite a sentence as: this  "Has the reader never known a season, when, in the fullest flow of thought and feeling, in the uni- versal action of the soul, an inward calm, profound   18       MUTTERIXGS AND as midnight silence, yet bright as the still summer noon, full ofjoy, but unbroken by one throb of tumult- uois passion, has been breathed through his spirit} and given him a glimpse and presage of the serenity of a happier world?"How many individuals, too, are there in this quarter of the globe, who could venture to reply in the affirmative to the questionM therein asked? a very small upper chamber of a very small mansion would probably hold them all. Do we even comprehend the meaning of this spirit- ual peace, these heaven-anticipating visions? we, 'who live in this " great center of commercial inter- ests," as we proudly call it, this bustling, crowded, Grand Cafeof a town-we bury the Doctor's books, to be sure-we give them an honorable place in our libraries. But do we read them with decided relish? Would we, on the whole, consider it a privilege to have an hour's talk, per-diem, -with the author'? Do we sympathize with him in these lofty views of his? Would we care to accompany him in these heaven- ward flights? I think I hear an overwhelming ma- jorityr reply, promptly and honestly, no, no, no--we are in no hurry for these celestial entertainments-- give us a snug perch, close alongside of dear old mother earth-we would not be super-spiritual yet a Wliile-we are for hugging, and making much of   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      i9 the good things about us. We decidedly prefer getting together over our pipes and punch-bowls, and discussing crops, trade, and politics--if con- science will, now and then, ask impertinent ques- tions, or if fancy will paint disagreeable pictures of the life to come, why, then we smoke all the more furiously, and drink the more deeply. Miserable deluded creatures, that say thus, if not always with their lips, at least in their lives-and yet we inva- lids are quite as bad in our way, quite as great earth- worms--are we not forever chattering about our groans and pains? Do we not gloat over and make as much of our pills and our purges, our tonics and our gruels, as our brethren, the epicures, do of their fricandeaux and their foie-gras, their wines and their salads? But surely there is some shadow of an excuse, in our case. Nature herself seems to have condemned us to be mere animals-ay, wilfully to have closed the gates upon us, were we ever so much disposed to enter any of the broad avenues of business, philanthropy, or study. If I, for instance, were to continue even these idle pen-ramblings for an hour longer, or were to read half a dozen more pages of the Review of Fenelon, what would be my reward? Why, all sorts of uncomfortable feelings. Feet like icebergs, head like a furnace, great diffi-    20       MU b'L 'ERINGS AND oulty of breathing, yes, all sorts of shakings, shiver- ings, shudderings, and nasty inexplicable sensations. I should have to resort fortwith to a scalding foot- bath, turn down a gallon or two of hot catnip tea, by way of stomach-soother, and probably have to lie all night, sandwiched in between two huge mustard plasters., Now, would it pay? Is knowledge worth having at such a price? as it is, I shall turn in with fear and trembling-fully expecting that broken, troubled, unrefreshing sleep that ever awaits the In- valid. r  A vile; vile day--sick as a dog-cold as a frog- cross as' a bear--hoarse as  crow-were my bite within gunshot of my bark, I could soon make my teeth meetfin this mahogany table--yes, I could nip off the heads of ten-penny nails, as if they were so many sprigs of celery, or spears of -asparagus. But alas,"few and inefficient are my grinders--calo- mel, and such like pleasing preparations, have con- signed two thirds of them- to an early grave-and as to getting a new porcelain outfit, would' it pay? Is it at all likely, that I should ever get a fair, satis- factory days work out of them? Could I -get a   MUSINGS'OF AN INVALTD.     21 new stomach with them, it would be an object, per- haps --what a queer world we live in-how many hundreds and thousands are there of my fellow beings, endowed with magnificent sets of masti- cators, and with stomachs longing for employment, who, nevertheless can only procure a meal of vic- tuals by begging or stealing it; while I, and many unfortunates like me, are surrounded by dainties, yet have no apparatus worthy of the name, either  for laying hold of theme dissolving them, or ex- tracting any comfort or benefit from them. Say, why is this? Tell us, ye ready readers of life's riddles, why are the gifts of nature and of for- tune distributed in this capricious, this abominable manner?! What have I done, that I should be cursed with this miserable constitution? My pa- rents have both been uniformly hale and hearty. I have committed no excesses, either in the way of pleasure or of study, that can account for my suffer- ings, No, I have been a sorry, rickety concern from the start-as an infant, my, kickings were fee- ble, my squallings tame and short-lived; as a boy, I had no strength for running, or kite-flying, or even marbles. I don't believe, I ever took a meal in all my life, before or since weaning, with real, unaffected relish-I ask again, why is this? Ex-   22    .   MUTTERINGS AND plain to me, ye, who decipher so promptly the handwriting of the Creator in all the minutiae of life, explain, if you please, the cui bono of this particu- lar arrangement. I cannot see it  Ah sir, you have no faith-faith-faith-had you a cheerful and abiding faith, you would put a better face on matters, and would not be whining and grumbling thus-alas, too true, too true, and yet how easy is - it for you, in this pert, flippant way to prescribe this sovereign remedy. I should like to see a little more of it in your own conduct and conversation; you are quite too sleek and rosy, most of you, for genuine disciples-let me be patient, however, I shall soon be on the other side of the great gulf-- then will this painful problem be solved-ay, and the ten thousand other mysteries of life, that now so tease, and vex, and puzzle the will, " and make sick the souls of us poor fools of nature." Confound those kittens-there they are, again, dancing the polka round my creamjug-pretty lit- tle villains-hide your diminished heads, ye Tagli- onis, and Ceritos, ye Ellslers, and Fitz Jameses-- what are all your- saltations, and circumgyrations, and attitudinizings, compared with the motions of these youngsters, these miniature, tame tigresses-- what treacherous looking eyes, though--yes, they   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.  -   23 look as if they had a vivid recollection of the apos- tasy, and were anxious to commence hostilities forthwith, with the whole family of man. Can it be, that the tradition hath been thus faithfully handed- down from one generation of cats to anoth- er? You would like, no doubt, you young scamps, to be in the woods at this moment, there combin- ing and confederating with your kinsmen, for the purpose of eating us all up, and having the planet to yourselves--yes, you would like to be sucking my breath, and scratching out my eyes, this blessed minute-off with you, sc--t' sc-t. This is Election Day, and we are all urged by our brethren of the press, in leaders of unusual fervor, to rush early to the polls, and deposit our votes; it seems that the country is more than ever in danger, this fine frosty morning. I can't help it, for one, I shall not budge an inch. What, wilfully run away from the discharge of this imperative duty? blindly waive the exercise of this sovereign right? throw away this choicest flower of your prerogative? Most assuredly-not, however, for any such pitiful reason, as that I am profoundly ignorant of the characters, even of the names of nearly all the gentlemen on each list of candidates; because, cripple though I be, it was clearly my      ;24  .MUWft'ICINGS AND duty to get full and clear information on these: im- portant points. I shall stay away, simply because I have not strength and nerve sufficient fairly to meet those annoyances which I am sure to encounter, if I go. I have quite too vivid a recollection, I assure you, of the scrape I got into, whilst exercising the elective franchise, last season. What did I gain by that experiment? Was I not detained, hustled, bruised? Were not my corns trod on? Did I not part company for ever with the larboard skirt of my coat? Was not my hat cut off in the flower of its youth? And did I not overhear myself called, several times, a cursed old Federalist? And was not one of these- very traducers, a servant whom I had turned off a few days before, for stealing my wine? And did not his vote destroy all the efficacy of mine? And did I not the next morning find, as usual, that I had been voting with a hopeless minority? And do you presume to ask me to make the same fool of myself to-day? I shall do no such thing, I assure you. Ay, but the union of these States--the blessed union itself, my dear sir, is in danger. I am. sorry to hear it, gentlemen, but really if it be in such a rickety condition, that its salvation depends upon the votes of a few invalids, why, the sooner it goes by the board, the better.   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      25 But I don't believe a word of it. I have no more doubt that, whichever of the two sets of candidates be chosen this day, the great, permanent, substantial interests of the union will be duly watched and protected, than I have that the boats will go up the river to-morrow, or the cars leave for Boston. At the same time, I am equally convinced that, in the present excited state of the public mind, there will be, in all human probability, as there was last year, a most disgusting scuffle at the Polls, which, as a sick man, I would fain dodge-so leave me, if you please, to the peaceful enjoyment of my morning gown and slippers. Disunion, forsooth! pray, where are these mighty men, these political Samsons, who threaten to bring down this glorious fabric about our ears? who would fain demolish this, the most solid, magnifi- cent structure that legislators ever erected for the admiration and imitation of mankind? Well, gen- tlemen, how are you going to, work? Where do you propose to begin? What vulnerable point have you selected for this impious- assault? What spell have you found potent enough to dissolve these myriad relations which bind us together, with -all 'their dependent duties, interests, memories, affections? relations which are multiplying every 2   -26       MUTrERINGS AND moment, by inter-marriage, by emigration, by al sorts of enterprises, public and private, religious and secular? Are we- not literally tied together by ten thousand bands of iron? And who are you, that would thus madly pull us apart, in spite of Nature and Art themselves? in spite of Steam and Lightning, who are even now, in fillfilment of their great mission, drawing us closer and closer con- tinually, as brethen and as sisters, and are con- verting this huge and ever growing republic into one great and loving family? Are we not at this moment, through their influences, far more compact and solid as a nation, far nearer together for all purposes of pleasures, or of business, for all inter- change of visits or of ideas, than we were when the old thirteen first joined their hands, and pledged their faith around the blessed tree of liberty? And now that the thirteen areson -the eve of becoming three times thirteen, do you propose to break up this beautiful association, to destroy this harmonious movement, and to throw us all back into confusion and chaos? Thank heaven, the idea is as mon- strous and absurd, as it is unfilial and villanous. Dissolve this union, truly I as well might a six- months-old babe undertake, with his tender little fingers, to pull a huge cotton mill to pieces--as well   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     27 ,might a parcel of truant boys, in a crazy sailboat, undertake to run down an ocean steamer, as this miserable gang of malcontents to wreck our glori. ous ship of state, OH DEAR, what a strange, absurd, ungovernable humor I am in this morning. I seem to have no control over myself whatever I can hardly keep from making all sorts of animal noises, from cutting -all sorts of silly capers-I feel like breaking all the panes of glass in the country--like smashing all the crockery and furniture of the land to atoms-- yes, I would like to begin, this minute, throwing double sommersets, and keep at it, heels over head, head over heels, even till the crack of doom. What crazy whims will continually enter this poor brain of mine, in spite of myself. I was, even now, in imagination, going down in 'a diving bell, down, down, down to the bottom of the sea, and for no other purpose than to pop a counterfeit hundred pound note into the hands of an astonished sea- nymph; and presently, I was going up in a great balloon, in company with chattering  apes and grinning wild-cats-yes, up, up, up to the blessed s .ts    28       MUTTtICING :SAND- moon itself and with no other or more laudale object in view, than to take the venerable man thee:of? by the nose..- Pray, is it not enough that my broken slumbers should be invaded by such abominable fancies, but they must beard me thus in broad daylight? -Am I not a poor, unlucky dog? At this rate, reason will soon leave me in disgusti .and- forever--ay, nd fdconscience will not mulch, longer condescend . to hold her court in such a miserable concern as I ami. What sort of a life is this I lead? What dignity, or value, or -moral meaning hath it?  A moment ago, I was. for indulging in all kinds of antics-making a perfect ninny and harlequin of myself; ,directly, I shall be as dull, and dumb, and helpless as a, mummy ;.or at- best, fidgetting over the fire, or growling over my gruel-yes, I begin to feel the reaction already --oh, how grim I look,-had I been chewing ashes for the- last six months, and washing. them down with ink, I could not have a more lugubrious visage. W;hat a time for some fool of a friend -to secure my portrait-what an inspiring. subject, .too, for-the artist. Unless he flattered me most villan- ously, his iwork would be a perfect emetic to the beholder. Oh, why am  I thus afflicted? thus incapacitated for all that is useful, respectable,   MUSINOS OF AN INVALID.     2 heroic in life? Why was I not;endowed with facul- ties of mind and: body, that would have enabled me to command an: army, or compile a code, or '"the applause of listening senates to command," or to plead the cause of the oppressed, or to preach God's word to my brethren? Why, in place of: all this, am I 'condemned :to wretchedness and useless- ness? a mere cumberer of the ground? tied down and enslaved to this wretched, dilapidated frame. What sort of a partnership is this, where the poor soul is quite defrauded of all share in the management of the concern? I am for dissolving. it forthwith. I long to say farewell to this rebellious stomach, these crazy lungs, these inefficient legs, these dull eyes, this unserviceable brain-let me go then, and have a -new outfit in the way of faculties-some new machinery, here or elsewhere, whereby I may be- come useful to others, and a comfort to myself-- yes, I am  willing to be the humnblest angel that ever flew upon a heavenly errand, or helped swell the celestial choir-anything,- anything that may please heaven, so I be speedily emancipated from this vile vassalage.    ,   o30 -     MUcTERTIGS AND WHAT a dose I have been taking! not of the usual kind, however.    has been in to see me, and has almost talked me to death-for two long mortal hours hashe been rattling away, with his. usual ardor and fluency, about what? Why, no less a theme than the uses and capabilities of India rubber. You would have really supposed, from his ,tone and manner, that there was nothing left under the canopy of heaven, but this great gum-that all the trees and shrubs of earth had given place to the syringe tree, and that the wholoe human race were, , or ought to be, hard at work, securing the precious sap. As to inserting a word edgewise, either in the way of approbation or of remonstrance, it was quite out of the question. Now, is it not too bad? What right has a man to monopolize the conversation thus? What right has he thus to unburthen him- self of his thoughts, however weighty they may be, without the slightest refeience to the taste, or habits, or character, of the person whom he is addressing? Why, what in the name of old Nicholas and all his imps, do I care about India rubber? What's caout- chouc to me, or I to caoutchouc, that he should bore me thus?" To make the matter worse, I was feeling tolerably comfortable this morning, and had abso- lutely forgotten my poor, sorry self, in the divine   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      31 pages of Milton-and to be disturbed in this unrea- sonable, unseasonable manner, to be literally hauled down from the seventh heaven of invention, to the low and grovelling-things of earth. I am out of all patience. I quarrel not with the gum, it i a good thing in its way--by no means the least of the gifts of the great Giver-let us use it, then, gratefully and intelligently, let us make the most of it in the way of coats, covers, bags, bottles, and knapsacks. If, possibly, there be some latent nutritive principle residing in it, let us have it out-if, under Provi- dence, India rubber be destined to supplant buck- wheat, in the shape of cakes for breakfast, why all the better-but do not, in the name of all that is reasonable, do not postpone to it, or to any thing that was merely given for food, or raiment, or shelter, matters of infinitely more dignity and importance. It is really sad to see a man of talent, and energy, and integrity, so far astray-to see him thus ab- sorbed, heart and soul, in things perishing, and wil- fully turning his back upon things essential. If we must be enthusiasts, do let it be in some great cause -so noble a  passion ought to be reserved for grand occasions-be enthusiastic, if you will, about your faith, or about great general truths and principles in science, art, government, but do not throw away all   32      - MUTTRINGS AND your zeal on iuch comparative trifles as the maxi- mum speed of a steamer, or the maximum product of an acre. - In this short, frail life of ours, can we be too particular as to the choice of our pursuits, the character of our ends and our means? can we be -tob careful as to what pleasures we seek, what books we read, what company we keep?   But au enthusiast is quite too apt to seek the society of those who reflect his own opinions; of those who, in their folly, or in their cunning, are the mere echoes of all his sentiments. Thus petted, and flattered, and be- guiled, will he not necessarily become conceited, opinionative, full of himself and his schemes, jealous of all opposition, if not positively overbearing and tyrannical? If his cause-were the loftiest on earth, surely these are not the qualitiesto add to its lustre, or to ensure its success, on the contrary, are not such men invariably, in the end, betrayed to their ruin, either -by their own blind passions, or by the arts of crafty men, whose tools they have become? Still, they may have the consolation of perishing in a noble. cause, but when a man's enthusiasm is forever expended upon trifles, and he is, moreover, per- petually shifting the objects of that enthusiasm, then there is neither diginity nor comfort to sustain him In the hour of trouble. If his schemes succeed,   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      33 there is no true glory in them-if they fail, as they are almost sure to fail, in his inconstant, impatient hands, they leave him without any claim on the ad- miration or sympathy of others. As to the kind offices of friends, what right has he to expect them? has he not ever preferred, to true friends, the com- pany of flatterers and underlings? Nay, fortunate will he be, if he escape the sneers and taunts of the very scoundrels who-have used him for their own selfish ends., Is'it not then, I ask again, a sorry sight, to behold a man of ability, and of good in- tentions, thus wandering from the right path; thus mistaking the true objects of life; thus wasting his energies upon a series of visionary projects; letting go this wild, mad-cap scheme, only to take hold of the next that comes along; dismounting from one hobby, only to jump up on another, and so to keep it up, to the end of the chapter, dashing and hurry- ing along, with all the speed and fury of a Gilpin, but, alas, without the good luck of a Gilpin at the close-yes, to see him, at last, thrown ingloriously to the ground, and, if escaping without broken neck or limbs, at best sadly bruised and wounded, in body and spirit, harassed, mortified, soured, ending his days, it may be, in gloom and bitterness of soul? But are we, who behold and comment upon this sad 2*   34      -MUTTliERINGS AND speeCaeei a whit better ourselves? Are we not all a poor miserable set of bunglers and blunderers? Prayi how many of us are there who are on the right track? How many are there on this round earth, this very moment, who can lay claim to any re- spectable amount of wisdom or of goodness? Are we not all blindly mistaking, or wilfully forsaking the true road to happiness; if we know the right, do we not still the wrong: pursue? Do we not meanly surrender to every little paltry temptation that springs up in our path? Who so amiable and exemplary, that he is not at- times disgusted with himself?. For my own poor part, when I think of what I ought to be, and of what I am, I am tempt- ed to curse the very hour of my birth. In what Women of the universe dare I -hold up my head?

Blue pill, the cause? let me give it due credit therefor-but then the infernal debit side of the account remains to be seen-I shall pay for it, no doubt, with most usurious interest-meanwhile, let me enjoy my freedom-let me taste this blessed, balmy air. I have had the happiness of seeing again, to-day, that noble work of art, the Comrse of Empire. Oh, is it not a magnificent performance? what grandeur of design-what beautiful and elaborate execu- tion-what affluence of ideas-and those ideas il- lustrated in so faithful and masterly a manner-no running away from the grand theme-no, it is fairly grappled with, and with a giant's strength-- into what a world of details, has the artist gone, and in what a thorough, exhausting way has he han- dled them--the whole forms, indeed, a glorious epic on canvass. In such hands, the pencil seems   36       MUTTERINGS AND more impressive and eloquent in its teachings even than the pen. Could Wordsworth himself have taught us this great lesson with equal power and beauty? There is, indeed, great similarity of genius in the two artists-the same loftiness and purity of thought-the same finished and elaborate splendor of style--the same intense love of, and diligent fol- lowing after, Nature. How different again, were they in their destinies-the .poet was permitted to wander and meditate in his loved woods, even to a good old patriarchal age-the painter was suddenly summoned from his labors in the very bloom and vigor' of his powers; when his brain was more than ever fertile in images of beauty, and his hand more than ever prompt to give them life and lustre. Oh,- can it be, that these rare faculties of his are forever hushed in death? No, no--our hearts protest, most fervently protest, against the horrid thought. Surely they exist, even now, and are actively employed in some higher sphere-exert- ed under more genial influences; emancipated from the paltry cares that so distract the artist's career on earth; united to some far more exquisite organi- zation; surrounded by far higher standards of grandeur, and- beauty, and goodness; expatiating in scenery far more magnificent; yes, drinking in   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      37 with an hundred-fold more joy, reproducing with an hundred-fold more power, lights and shades, ailf forms and hues, which it entereth not into the hearts of us poor residents of earth to conceive. Is it not better to believe this, than to believe that such precious gifts are rusting in the earth, unused? Is then the great soul of Shakspeare still a prisoner beneath that solemn chancel? condemned, for how long we know not, to the silence, and darkness, and nothingness of that dreary vault? or is it at large, playing some lofty part, doing some glorious duty, in some nobler region of the universe? The idea of annihilation cannot be tolerated-but this indefi- nite suspension of our faculties, this waiting in our graves, thousands of years, perhaps, for some vague- ly defined and ever-receding day of judgment-is it a pleasant, an inspiring thought? And those of us who were without graves, who were burned to ashes, or ground to powder, or devoured by beasts, or swallowed up in ocean, where are they slum- bering? What has become of these millions on millions of souls that were made since the world began? Are they all in a state of unconsciousness? And are they to be joined by millions on millions more of sleepers, century after century, even to the dawning of this great day of reckoning? Why   %a       :l tJrMUTTIKClNGS AND -this indefinite postponement of the rewards of the uous, and of the punishmeilts of the wicked? Why this monstrous waste of faculties, that might have been put to noble uses elsewhere? But if this' be the Scripture doctrine, how worse than idle are all these inquiries. Submit then in silence; ask no more vain questions, that cannot be answered on this side the grave-Revelation hath not conde- scended to answer them; Reason is overwhelmed in the attempt to solve them-these are themes to be approached but seldom, even by the mightiest mmds-and then with honest purpose, and reverent demeanor. What right then have such fellows as I, whose wi'ts, such as they are, are all enfeebled and entangled by disease, to meddle with these matters, and to puzzle ourselves with thoughts beyond the renhes of our souls? Let ipe then run away intime, else death or lunacy will surely overtake me-far better for me to be chopping wood thes minute, or drawing water, or even crying elamns along the high- way, than to be indulgingg in these vain specula- tions. Am  I not already paying for this abuse of my freedom? My head swims, my blood is stag- nant--let me rush out into the street, and walk as if eighteen hundred bailiff: were after me--yes, doc- tor, I will-you're right--the animal nature must   MUSINGS, OF A3 NVAT TT)D.    39 be developed-the legs must do double duty, and the brain must retire on half-pay. Boating, riding, billiards, shuffleboard, quoits, tenpins, be these the great, the predominant employments of my days-- chequers, cribbage; backgammon, be these the so- lace of my nights--chess is quite too intellectual. As for mathematics or metaphysics, farewell, for- ever, to them--a long farewell to Locke, and Bacon, and Shakspeare, and Milton, and Coleridge.

Yes, my dear doctor, you merely ask me to throw the ear of corn away, and hug the husk to my bosom--to let the kernels go, and fasten my teeth in the shells.

How can it be otherwise? Is not my stomach again in a state of rebellion? Do not my legs refuse to honor my drafts ? I might as well carry a pumpkin about upon these shoulders, as this poor, miserable, unserviceable noddle-oh, how the thatch is tumbling from this thin roof of mine--my hairs are leaving me, faster than ever rats abandoned sinking ship. If paying away dol- lars to quacks could have effected it, I ought now to be putting Absalom  to the blush, with my thick, golden clusters; but no, gentlemen, in spite of your long classic names, your flaming manifes- toes, and your gayly-colored and nose-inviting pre- parations, the tonsure is hourly increasing in cir- cumference-not all the oil in all the bears of either pole can mend the matter-my pate will very soon become as smooth and shining as yon ostrich egg- it is so written in the book of fate: I am strongly inclined, moreover, to the opinion, that a furiously small proportion of the heads that fall in your way, reap any benefit from your costly mixtures-be- tween ourselves, is not the whole- -thing a gigantic   I   humbug?   And yet, your patients seem to be in- creasing continually-your deluded victims are scattered all over the union, even to the remotest bounds of Oregon.   You grow rich, you build splendid houses, you drive showy equipages, you lead the fashion, you lay down the law, not only in your own department, but in all the walks of life. You would, no doubt, feel indignant, to be compared, either as men of intellect, or as benefac- tors of your race, to Hale, or Holt, or Mansfield, or Marshall, or Kent, or Story.

How restless, how fidgety-how precious your time has suddenly become-you either-wilfully feign a pre-engagement, or bluntly refuse to give a solitary penny to any such visiona- ry enterprises. You are: willing to give ten dollars for a single concert ticket, but refuse half the amount to the aged indigent females, or colored half orphans of the county-you propose to give a thou- sand dollar ball in the course of the season, but have not the remotest idea of adding five to the salary of that hard-working clergyman, who is compelled: to; sustain hiself, wife, and baker's dozen of children upon paltry two hundred.

Is this mere talk, or the naked truth?  So intellectual, too-will any man deny, that, even in this glorious nineteenth century, there are far more hundreds and thousands who relish cock-fights and prize-fights, than there are units and tens who enjoy the sermons of a Chalmers, or the opinions of a Marshall? I 'speak not as a cen- sor-alas, I am not a whit better than my neigh- bors; disabled, shut out as I am from their ordi- nary amusements and dissipations, am I not, in my small way, quite as selfish and sensual ?

Yes, even that were better than to sit here, moping, and groaning, and nursing these hor- rible feelings, these cruel enemies of my peace. I OUGHT to be grateful for a rare privilege that I have enjoyed this morning-that of seeing two ex- quisite pictures-Cole's Dream of Arcadia, and Du- rand's Thanatopsis. The first is a composition full of beautiful details--replete with all that is sweet, and touching, and soothing in rural life-.here are noble spreading trees, and far reaching vistas-in the dis- tance, gray hills and towers with time-stained walls -nearer, on the right, a gushing, sparkling water- fall-in front, the same stream, placidly winding through the valley-mothers with their children are wandering along its banks-boys are gathering lilies on its margin-a little farther on, it is spanned by a graceful bridge, over which a maiden and her lover are galloping--under the trees are scattered groups of old men and women, young men and maidens-some are spinning, some dancing and making music, some   MU'lTERIEINGS AND returning from the chase--others are chatting, or quietly basking in the sweet sunshine-on       the brow of a neighboring hill stands a classic temple, its image partially reflected in the stream that skirts its base-before it, priests are offering sacrifices, the smoke from   which is gently curling up into the calm, bright sky-oh, what a charming scene, so happily composed, and clad "in such robes of splen- dor-what a cordial to the nerves is it, to behold a picture like this. Blessed he, who can dream such dreams, and can thus portray them for the delight and edification of his brethren !I How different the Thanatopsis-less brilliant, less crowded with im- agery, but equally fine in its way-a calm, solemn, comprehensive picture-far more subdued in its style than the other, but far grander in its subject, and appealing far more powerfully to our hearts. How admirably doesoit illustrate and enforce the thoughts of the poem which suggested it-" Earth, and her waters, and the depths of air," are here in- deed teaching the great lesson which the poet assigns them, in his. matchless verse-here are the same hills Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun-the vales Stretching in pensive quietness; between- The venerable woods-rivers that move In majesty, and the complaining brooks That make the meadows green.   I   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.   47   Here too are the familiar images of Death--the church, and churchyard, the narrow  house, the funeral rites, all announce his presence, while his past triumphs are disclosed by broken statues, and prostrate columns, half buried in earth-over the scene the setting sun is shedding a gentle, mellow light, diffused'through the "soft vapory air"--the effect of the whole is most tranquillizing and delight- ful. I say again, happy they who can see such things, and can describe them thus, with pen and pencil, for the gratification and instruction of their fellow-men:--"Blessings be on them, and eternal praise"--their laurels well become their brows-true benefactors are they; far more deserving of the name than the man who merely multiplies the blades of grass upon earth's scrface-what doth he, but hum- bly minister to our bodily wants, while they sustain, and comfort, and elevate our hearts. ANOTHER bright morning-would that I were -bright; but no, I'm as dull as a penny that has been in circulation half a century-I am disgusted with myself and life, and all that belongs to it-I am tired to death of this eternal round of little paltry nothings    48      - MUTTL'rRINGS AND that go to make up my existence-tired of paying tribute to this vile body-it is a sufficiently humili- ating service that we have to render, even in good health. What with the calls of nature and the re- quirements of decency, we have an abundantly busy time ofit--what a frightfully large portion of our lives is necessarily consumed in eating, drinking, sleeping-in washing, dressing, shaving-tying and untying-buttoning and unbuttoning!--what an infernal amount of brushing, rubbing; scouring, combing, paring, trimming, must be performed by every mother's son of us, be he wise or foolish, hearty or sickly--why, at least half the gift of life is swallowed up in these miserable minutiae. But to 'have to lavish these,--and ten thousand other little delicate attentions, on such a contemptible, ungrate- ful carcass as Iam tied to-is it not too bad? Yes, I am sick unto death of standing under shower- baths; of irritating this old hide with plasters and hair-gloves; of dancing attendance on cathartics; of gagging over bowls, while waiting the good pleasure of emetics-out upon it--what vile, intol- erable slavery it is-oh dear, this is the thousandth time to-day, I believe, that I have blown this ras- cally old nose of mine-ought I be to very grateful for such a small-beer, small-potato existence as this?

Fie, fie, fie I shame on you, man. Is this the language or the conduct of a Christian, or of a respectable heathen? Would Socrates have talked or acted in this disgraceful manner? not he; nor Aristides, nor Phocion, nor Philopoemen--true, true, true!

Have I an appetite so often, too, that I can afford to have it taken away in this infamous style? pah! never, never shall the filthy wretch darken my doors again. But am I not too hard upon him? Is he not, with all his nastiness, one of the most talented, amiable, exemplary of men? In- deed, he is. I ask his pardon-nay, I confess, that though I was forced to hold my nose during the whole visit, I was right glad to keep my ears wide open, for he talked both wittily and wisely. The more the pity, that he should be cursed with such an infirmity. There seems to be no help for it-all the remonstrances of his friends, all the mortifica- tions that he is constantly subjected to, make no impression upon him--he is determined literally to fulfill the injunction of Scripture, "he which is filthy let him be filthy still"-he will be, most unquestiona- bly, so long as that vile breath remains in that un- washed body-of his-the only bath he will ever take, will be owing to a tumble -into some dock, or the capsizing of a boat, or, possibly, the misdirected efforts of some hose: company. His wardrobe, too, will, no doubt, retain the same spotted aspect, the   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      51 same dilapidated condition, even to the closing scene. What sort of lodging must the man live in--few piggeries, in the union, probably, as unsa- vory. Can he wonder that people dddge him, cut him, slam their doors in his face? Is it at all strange, that boys stop their sports to point at him? that babies squall, and horses take fright, when he heaves in sight? that dogs bark at him? that tem- perance tracts are slipped into his hand? that om- nibus-drivers hesitate about receiving him? that barbers are in no hurry to shave him? that discreet sextons will not show himn to a pew? that landlords say, " we are full," when he presents himself at the counter? a pretty fellow, he, for a pall-bearer, or groomsman, or manager at a ball, or aid to a Grand Marshal. Ought he to expect any reasonable wo- man to accept his addresses? to acknowledge him as a lover, compared with whom, the farthest-gone cheese is as fragrant as the rose of Sharon? No, no! Love is blind, but then the nose has its claims, and cannot put up with such a standing insult as this-- and if he were married, I doubt whether it would alter him in this particular-the -habit is quite too confirmed-if he did not positively disgrace- himself upon his" wedding day, still, long, long beefore the   52     .

Ought there to be any compromise with nastiness? Filth--the enemy, not only of comfort and comeli- ness, but of good order and sound morals-what can we expect from a community that will not keep their streets clean? what, but eternal tumults and breaches of the peace?

Nay, who would take the wisdom of Diogenes, if com- pelled to take his dirt along with it? who would listen to the divine Plato himself, if forced to hold a bottle of salts to his nose, or to burn pastiles all the time he was talking? no-Beauty, Dignity, Morality, Piety, all alike protest against such intolerable beastliness.

Ought I  to bluah when I say that I often envy my four- footed brother his many privileges? his sound sleep, for instance-his unfailing  appetite, his princely digestion, his freedom  from care, his exemption from all the servile labors of the toilet-no boots pinch hMs toes--no hat chafes his brow-no coat cuts htim to the quick-his life is short, to be surehis death violent; his exit is a noisy and undignified one, I  admit-but then it is soon over--and after death, there is the consoling thought that he con- fers pleasure on the man that eats him-while I enjoy nothing here, nor shall be enjoyed after I am gone.

Yes, the great English moralist himself was but too happy to descend from his sublime moral stilts, to drop down from his lofty rhetorical flights, and literally transform himself into a swine, not only in the quantity that he ate, and the voracity with which he pounced upon the viands, but in the actual vocal accompaniments of his over-relished meals. What right, then, have we ordinary mortals to take airs upon ourselves, and to disclaim all relationship with our poor four-legged neighbors, and co-tenants of earth? Are not they, as well as we, a part of the blessed work of creation, and were they not pronounced good? And are we so very much bet- ter? No, I say again, that for one, I am more dis- posed to'envy than to crow over these brethren of the land, and sea, and sky. So far from insulting them, I am for cultivating amicable relations with the whole concern, even with- mosquitoes even they must have some latent good qualities, or they   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     55, would not have; entered into the creation-plan.

Who has not seen horses that he could almost hug, and dogs that he could almost die for, such noble traits have they revealed-nor let the pig go un- honored--he too, has done wonders in his day. Who does not remember with pleasure the exploits of the famous learned swine, who a few years since made the tour of our beloved Union? what a fa- mous crop of laurels he gathered for himself and of dollars for his owner--it was delightful to see him, sitting cozily on his haunches, and taking a social game of whist-often securing the odd trick, too, by a happy display of memory and judgment. I won- der what ever became of that interesting porker-- was there not a dark rumor that hefell, in the dead of night, before the treacherous blade of a Cincin- nati butcher? and yet I can hardly believe that such a wretch as he must have been, ever trod the soil of Ohio--yes, it was even so-and at the very time when the dear quadruped was about to comrn. renee a course of German literature-out upon this vile, money-loving age and land. Had this pre- cious pig been a native of Italy, how different had been his career-he would have gone down to his   56       bUlri'EINSONGS DAND gravee-full of years and honors-his pen would have been lined with mother-of-pearl, and hung round with masterpieces-poets would have sung his praises statues of bronze and marble would have been raised in his honor, in everypia of ever city through-the land.

Had my constitution been other than it is, might I not at this very mo- iment have been a gambler, drunkard, rake, or an impudent quack, or vile pettifogger, or pot-house politician, or somet other suclh hauisance to society? or;, if innocent, still a. poor drudge, and hack, a slave to cares immersed in unprofitable pursuits, absorbed in vain speculations?

What sort of goodness is that which never tastes the air-which sees no service--which never, perhaps, has had a solitary fair up-and-down fight with the adversary? pretty poor, flimsy stuff I should say-and snall and cheap ought to be its rewards--no burden in the cross, no lustre in the crown--who wants such paltry laurels? No, give me a prize worth fighting for-give me health, strength, vigor of mind, ay, all the endowments of a man, with all his perils and responsibilities. Thus armed, let me go forth and struggle with Beelzebub, as best I may-if I conquer, then bind my brows with victorious wreaths. If I fall, I fall through my own folly and wickedness, and let me pay the bitter penalty-let me suffer, in shame and silence, the punishment that I have fairly earned. But am I not deceiving myself? Even as it is, am I so very sure of heaven-are my prospects in the next world so very cheering? ave I even that negative good- ness of which I speak?

Why, -did I not, but even now, in the bitterness; of my/heart, curse an inoffensive brother that parsed; by my window, and for no better rea- son tthan because he-looked plump, and rosy, and vigrous, and swung his arms about with a happy, selsatisfied air? Am I not, too, continually envy- ing the rich man his riches, the scholar his acquire- ments, the harnied- man his familyl? Am I not at  4 this very momient, murmuring at :my lot, compelled as I am by sickness to, this vile, dreary bachelor ex- istence. Why may I not discharge the great primal duty of man, that of begetting offspring? Is it not all that the Scriptures, icondesend to tell uis about men, :for the first twenty centuries of their exist- ence, that they begat sons and daughters? And why am I deprived of -the duties: and pleasures of marriage, why thus shut out from my proper place in society? And so I fret, and grumble, and curse my hard fate, and question the ways of Providence.         qu   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      59 And is such a fellow fit for heaven? A pretty figure, truly, should Icut amongst the cherubim and sera- phim-great pleasure should I take, indeed, in their sweet hymns and fervent hallelujahs! Iy feelings are far more like those of wicked Machethi "I 'gin to be aweary of the sun, And wish the estate of the world were all undone." Fie, for shame, where is-'my faith-faith, the only comfort for poor, erring mortals, the only stay for falling sinners-faith in the paternal govern- ment of God.  But, oh I how hard it is to get Such faith.  The idea seems almost monstrous, that I, a feeble, imbecile nobody, occupying a mere pin-point, as it were, of space, living but a poor hour or two of time, should claim such near and dear relation- ship with Him who is eternal, omniscient, omni- present, omnipotent. Alas, these very'attributes that we so flippantly ascribe to the Creatori so far from ministering to our comfort, only crush and overwhelm our minds. The idea, again, that by means of some vile sickness, or paltry casualty, we are summoned forthwith into the presence of such a Being as this, is it reasonable? On the contrary, must not millions and millions of years elapse, with their corresponding development of my moral and   60       MUTVE'iRINGS AND intellectual nature, before a creature, such as I, could endure, for a moment to be be -confronted with the ineffable glory of the Infinite God? Do not all the laws of Order, and of Progress, and of Harmony, forbid a notion so monstrous? Still leave me not desolate, let me have some Father in heaven, though he be not the very God of the universe-let me have some Throne of Grace, at whose feet to lay my petitions-some dread tribunal, to which to render my account-my poor soul must repose somewhere. I would not be an outcast-from heaven-I seek not to be absolved- from my allegiance-sinner that I am, I would not escape my just punishment. Such a poor, helpless wretch as I am, must lean upon some higher power, even were it the most cruel of tyran- nies-some future state or other I ask for, even were it one of torment, anything, anything but annihila- tion. The thought that I am the mere child of chance, and as such, entitled to a dreary indepen- dence, ending in oblivion, is too horrible to be borne; heart and soul rebel against it; all the phenomena of life give it the lie. Men sometimes affect to believe it, but no, they do not. Were it the real creed of the world, it would become one huge den of drunk- ards, thieves, and murderers, ere this new moon were old.

Could there ever have been any education, or laws, or manners, or any society whatever, without the religious prin- ciple? No, we should not have even risen to the dignity of savages, but would have been positive beasts. The earth might still, perhaps, have per- formed her circuit in the heavens--might still hive been visited by the fair light of day--but what a rugged, howling wilderness she would have been, instead of the dear, glorious, venerable planet that she is.

What had I done, to be thus tormented? Had I been an usurper and a murderer, like Macheth, there would have been some meaning in the thing-had I even had the "raging tooth," which kept that respectable man, Iago, awake, I might have been reconciled to it--but to feel neither the sting of remorse nor of downright physical pain, and yet to be condemned to this horrible sleeplessness, is it not too bad?

Well, it's allright; no doubt,'twas so ordered,so written, with other and weightier matters, in the book of -destiny;- so we go; it's tough little neigh- bor, there will .very likely fight out the gale, and a great many gales.; yes, will be' standing there a century hence;: possibly my own, surely some of myneighbors', great great great grandchildren, will be frolicking rounib it some fine morning in the year   MUSINGS OF AN INVAT Tm.     83 1950. Where shall we be then? ugh I I shiver to think of it. Our poor carcasses, we know, long, long before that day, will have become cold victuals for hungry worms; our poor bones will have quietly settled down into powder; but the undying part; the soul, the conscience, the affections; where will they be? ah I dear, dear, dear, the wisest and best of us know but precious little aboutthe matter. Reason, with all her airs and pretensions, her owl-like looks, and solemn head-shakes, her plausible conjectures and dashing theories, has mighty little to say in the way of satisfaction or comfort-Revelation, blessed thing that it is, is nevertheless amazingly sparing in its statements about the future life-a few vague facts are told us, a few dark hints thrown out, no- thing further, no details-the when, and where, and how-not a word, not a word on these points--and yet these are questions which it seems the most natural thing in the world to ask; children are ask- ing them continually; tell me, tell me, where shall I be, when this poor breath has taken leave of this miserable body? Alas, that good book, that dear venerable quarto yonder, with all its glorious mes- sages, its glad tidings of great joy, will not con. descend to answer me; well, well 'tis wisely so de- creed: why then bother my poor head about the   ugly   - MU-TTERIBSXGSND mattedr?

How wcud he have helped it; is it not an essentially, supremely ridiculous spectacle, to behold the hab- itual wearer of a wig suddenly deprived thereof, be it by an unmannerly puff of wind, or by the mis- chievous hand of childhood? Can any moral worth on the part of him who is thus unceremoniously laid bare, or any intellectual preeminence, or any lofti- ness of station, prevent our having a good, hearty, glorious laugh at his expense? no, assuredly not; now and then, a thing will turn up, so intrinsically ludicrous, that, seasonable or unseasonable, right or wrong, there is no running- away from it; laugh we must, or give up the ghost. Who could control himself, for instance, when  found that sow in hispew, on that famous Sunday morning? How the old creature ever got there was always a mys- tery; it was supposed that the heat of the weather had entrapped the Sexton into an unlucky nap, during which the veteran street-walker had pro- bably straggled in, and so blundered up the middle aisle, coming to anchor in the aforesaid pew. Who,   MUSINGS OF A-y INVALTID.     87 that was present, can ever forget the scene that occurred when the discovery was made? such- poking, and pulling, and kicking, and squealing, and grunting, ending, after much delay, in the forci- ble expulsion of the intruder; it was altogether too much for the nerves of the congregation; after many laudable efforts to hold in, it was found of no use, nature would have her way, a hearty laugh arose from all present, effectually driving away all im- pressiveness and solemnity from the sanctuary; the clergyman himself could not resist the contagion; the sacred desk fairly shook with peals of uncon- trollable laughter; seeing the turn that things had taken, like a sensible man, he immediately dismissed us, stating, as he did, with some difficulty, that after what had transpired, it was quite out of the ques- tion to get through the services of the morning in the right spirit; oh, Lord I it makes me snicker to think of it, even now. Well, well, well, let's laugh while we can; heaven knows there's enough to cry about, in this strange world of ours. What a world, what a frightful, complicated mass it is, of all sorts of mysteries; nay, the experience of a single day, to a man of any reflection or sensibility, what a ter- rible jumble it seems of conflicting thoughts, feel- ings, occurrences. What does it all mean? Who   88      -MUTTERINGS AND can unravel this tangled skein? Who can explain the morale/ or the rationale of all these strange phe- omena, in ourselves, and in things about us? An hour ago, it was high tragedy with me, and now'tis broad farce; then, there was a meaning, a .dignity, a solemnnity in life and all that belongs to, it; then - .felt like a rational, accountable being, with glorious faciaties to- be developed,- with high aims for me to acomplish,-and a lofty'destiny in store; now, every- thing seems:: a mere harlequinade; I'd as lief be the clown in the ring as the king on his throne; as lief be that bawling, begrimed -charcoal vender in the street yonder, as the great champion of the consti. tution himself. Why this absurd transition, this piti- 'ful inconsistency? Why am I, one moment, full of faith and hope, disposed to look upon the bright side of men and things, cheerful, resigned to what- ever may happen, ay, ready to meet the hardest- blows of fortune, with the calm submissiveness, the placid smile of: a martyr, and, the very next minute, perhaps, cursed with abominable thoughts, silly fancies, vile appetites, tumultuous passions? Why, :why is this frightful war for ever going on within us? - A little while -ago, I felt like an intellectual 'being, eager to learn, delighted to grapple with any difficulties in art or science; :ready to climb the diz-   MUSINGS- OF AN INVALID.    89 ziest heights of mathematics, or to explore :the dreariest labyrinths of law; now, I shrinkback fom the simplest sum in the arithmetic. Out Upon such rididulshvet          e, -  ridiculous incongruities, such-vile weaknesses! And then, again, what frightful inequalities, what strang e anomalies, what horrible casualties, do we see per- petually occurring in the world without us; how in- explicable, how overwhelming at times Yonder goes a man rolling in wealth and luxury; he was born to it; he will doubtless die, surrounded by it. When he departs, they. will put him in a sumptuous coffin, shining like a mirror, and as richly lined as was her lady's boudoir; they will give him astately funeral, and solemn funeral rites; and so they will send him to his long home, with a grand flourish of drums  and trumpets; fulsome obituaries will be served up in his honor, and in due time, a gaudy monument will rise over his remains, in. some fashionable rural cemetery. The poor fellowthat ran against him just now, and whom he cursed so, what a  different time he has had of it in this world, and is likely to have; that - moving- naas of rags began to draw breath .in some dark-den of shame and infamy; a penniles, friendless ra.- bond from the beginning, thus far he has been kicked and cuffed along the highway of life, and he   90      MU'-T'ERAINGS AND looks as if he expected to be kicked and cuffed up to the closing scene; the terminus of his sad pil- grmage, most probably, a prison or the gallows; no funeral ceremonies will be thrown away upon his poor carcass, no tear be shed over it, no grave re- ceive it; no, 'twill be chopped up in some pro- fane dissecting room, most likely, for the edifi- cation of a set of noisy students, who will crack their vile jokes, and puff their filthy tobacco smoke over it, in mockery-oh, can it be, that these two men are the children of the same Heavenly Parent, alke creatures 'of his care, alike heirs of immortali- ty, alike responsible at his bar? Why, why then permit such terrible, such cruel disparities of condi- tion at the very outset of their career? Why con- tinue them thus pertaiaciousoly to the close? Why, again, these frightful inequalities as-to endowments? There goes a man across the street, with a bundle on his head-it is his calling-he is equal to. no other-his head is only fit to balance bundles on- education can do nothing for him-he has been tried and found wanting-there is nothing there to educate-you could no more educate that man into a respectable merchant or competent lawyer, than you could by culture convet a squash into a cluster of delicious grapes-yes, and the very next person   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     91 that you see there, following at his heels, but whc knows him not? Who knows not that capacious brow, those eyes that flash glorious fire, that tongue which sends forth its winged words, whose burning eloquence sets the hearts of a whole nation in a blaze? Why, oh why, is our Father in heaven so prodigal of his good gifts to the one, and so cruelly sparing of them to the other? Why, again, put one immortal soul in a poor, paltry, contemptible body, with scarce a sound organ in it, a perpetual source of disquiet and pain to its owner, yes, a continual stumbling-block in his path, while another is en- dowed with a glorious set of nerves and muscles, a magnificent pair of lungs, and all other appurte- nances that can minister to its wants and delights? Oh, is it fair? Why does one man prosper in all his undertakings, everything he touches turning to gold, his very blunders even having a happy issue, while his neighbor, equally amiable, more intelli- gent, perhaps, is for ever in hot water, cheated by crafty villains, worried out of his life by hard- hearted creditors, and dying at last a poor desolate bankrupt? Why is one fair island blessed with all that a land can be blessed with; made the seat of wealth, power, art, science, civilization, while its neighboring sister, equally lovely by nature, is yet   ^  MU' UTI'EINGS AND cursed with every evil under the sun?-is become the Head  Quarters of Wretchedness, Famine, Death? 'Why permit these -things? Why, too, permit so much innocent suffering in the world? Why should all these poor wives and children un- dergo 'sotrow, poverty, ignominy, for the misdeeds of husbands ard 'fathers? Why allow one man's drunkenness, or incompetence, to send hundreds of souls to their account, without a moment's warning? Why allow the insane ambition of another to bring thousands and thousands to an untimely end upon the battle-field? Why, too, all these dire accidents- these famines, floods, pestilences, shipwrecks, earth- quake  conflagrations? What do they mean? What lesson do they -teach? Who can decipher them? - Oh dear, what child cannot ask these ques- tons? -- What sage can answer them satisfactorily? Who is not tempted at times, when pondering over these terrible mysteries, to become desperate, and unbelieving, 'and reckless?-, One is almost dis- posed to ask, can:it -be, that God is actually watch- ing over this world of ours? Hath he not :aban, dOned the 6charge to, underlings; to a set of ne glectful angels- who are either slumbering on their postgs,or have -deserted them? Why then worry -my head abbutf the matter? Why not let things   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     93 take their course? Of what consequence is it, the life: I lead, or-the death I die? Why care to pre- serve Law and Order in this little world within, when I see everything at sixes and sevens in the great world without?  Why care to be wise? What does wisdom bring its owner, but a clouded brow, and sunken cheeks, and hairs white before their time? No, let's laugh and be jolly-let's drink, dance, fool, fiddle away our lives, and let Reason and Conscience go hang. A-precious con- clusion to come to, to be sure--and yet, who does not at times give way to such rascally feelings? Or rather, who does struggle with them as he ought? Are not the lives of most men a virtual endorse- ment of these horrible notions? Oh, away- with them, irrational, sinful, perilous that they are-- there is, there is a meaning, a deep hidden wisdom in these arrangements, of Providence, though our poor feeble wits cannot fathom it-there is a key to these dread puzzles-an answer to these soul vex. ing riddles-not here-'the blessed life to come will answer all these questions--oh, without that faith, that hope, existence were:a miserable, dreary farce indeed--meanwhile, are we,because thus ignorant and in the dark, to break out into rebellion? To throw Reason and Conscience overboard, and let   MU'1IfiRINGS ADND the vile crew of appetites and passions take com- mand of -the ship? Oh, no, no, poor children that we are, we must obey, not question the orders of our Parent-scholars, we are to learn the lessons which-the Great Teacher sets us, not set up a course for ourselves-a pretty idea, truly, that we babies, in this infant school of our existence, should array our little silly notions in opposition to the plans of the great Governor of the Universe--better submit, without useless noise or scuffling, to the discipline prescribed--how absurd, too, to be kicking and pounding, in this petulant way, against the door which the Master hath closed and barred against us --we cannot enter-we are wasting breath and tem- per, neglecting our tasks, and earning a hearty whip- ping for our pains. Alas, alas the most puzming and; painfnl part of the problem of life still keeps staring us in the face. Oh, why, why is it, that' with such clear convictions of duty, with Reason, Conscience, Interest, all uniting to point out the right path, we will obstinately stick to the wrong one?- Why is it so much more natural, easy, con- genial to our feelings, to be wicked than to be good?- to be earthly, sensual, devilish, than to be pure, and spiritual, and heavenly minded? Why is it, 4that for one bona fide, handsome victory over the   I   MUSINGS OF AN INVATLD.   evil one, we must plead guilty to a hundred dis- graceful, ignominious defeats? Is it not so? There may be a lucky handful, with whom it is otherwise, but are not an overwhelming majority of us just such infatuated beings? Have we not been so from the start? Only think of the frightful accumula- tion of evil thoughts, words, actions, that has been going on, from the creation till now; contrast it with that meager heap of offerings to virtue-Olym-- pus to a mole-hill. Why was itso decreed? Why was it not rendered more easy, more agreeable to our propensities, to do right? Why has Satan been allowed such authority, such fatal influence over our hearts? Why is he permitted to run away with so much of the wit, beauty, energy, talent of the world? Why were not these gifts consecrated to the cause of goodness? We do not ask to be mere puppets, propelled, willing or unwilling, along the path to Heaven; that would render life a stupid, vapid affair, indeed-the dullest of all dull panoramas-but why compel us to fight against such terrible odds? But how unwise, how wicked it is to dwell on these questions-such are the de- crees of Infinite Wisdom, and we must submit-- r* I   Why murmur then? Why indulge a vain spirit of curiosity, that may not be gratified?

Well, well, be it so-I must be satisfied to be an ignoramus, a nobody--and yet, it is pretty hard to have to turn one's back for ever on such a goodly company--there are some choice spirits upon those old shelves-there's Goethe and Schiller and Dante and Boccacio and Cervantes and Moliere. Dear old Homer's there too, and Virgil and Horace and Cice- ro and Demosthenes and the glorious -tragedians. What troops of English and American friends, too- wits, poets, essaysits, dramatists, historians. Philoso- phers, too, and statesmen, and jurists, and divines of all denominations--and may I never again have the privilege of an hour's interview with any of these worthies? never again set at the feet of these great teachers, and drink in their words of wisdom? Is life worth having, on such conditions? What, must I abstain henceforth from tasting this pure nourishing mental food, and nibble away at newspa- pers, and 'such small talk as I can pick up in streets and-parlors? 'or, at best, snatch a hasty innutricious  ,    98.      M UTTUrlBINGS AND meal at churches or lecture-rooms, or mass-meetings, or theatres? How can a soul grow and thrive on such sorry fare? But why grumble? I am fit for nothing better-the doctor's right-I have no busi- ness here, amongst these bards and sages and ora- tors-this poor brain is quite unequal to such ex- citements. If I persist in them, I shall become a hopeless cripple, perhaps lose my poor wits alto- gether. Away, then, away-why linger here another moment? I ought now to be out, scowering the streets, tumbling over boxes, bales, hogsheads, pric- ing rum and -sugar and cotton, -discussing Bank Stocks and Government Loans, and ship news, and rates of Exchange, and such matters-that's what my brethren are all about-they are astonished that I should want to be locked up here amongst these books. They'd as lief be sent to Sing Sing, as be compelled to pass two consecutive days in this little 'Sanctum of mine-they may be right; and yet, to me, it is the most fascinating spot on earth, even now, when I can no longer enjoy or profit by its treasures. But away, away-don't sit here, inviting wretched- ness and imbecility-any exercise, any employment, I care not what, sooner than such a miserable state of things as this-better be opening oysters, or sell- ing cabbage, or accumulating soap-fat, all day long   ]MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     99 -anything, anything that will work a revolution in this outer man of mine.' Oh, shall I ever know what it is to have a pair of rosy cheeks,and a strong arm, and a good stomach? What is wit or learning worth without them? Who would not rather be a garbage-gatherer, in high health, than a neuralgic archbishop? Oh dear-health, health, health--the great blessing of blessings, the foundation of all that is delightful, useful, glorious in life; why, why amIthus defrauded of it? Can it be, that these very books, that I have so idolized, that I now leave with such regret, are at the bottom of all my sufferings? not so--I will not be so ungrateful as to tax them with these rascally feelings. They certainly have aggra- vated them, though.  They certainly have cheatedl me out of much wholesome exercise, and sound sleep-have made me   hurry down many a meal most villanously. Have they not given this beau- tiful curve to my shoulders, too? Have they not driven these eyes of mine to spectacles; before their time? Confound them, they are greatly to blame in this matter. Now that I look at them again, they have not half the lustre and the dignity they had- ill is not gold that glitters-there s a great deal of rubbish, trash, humbug, mixed up with that wisdom and beauty--how much real, substantial merit, when   -MU'TtRINGS ANJD  you come to analyze it, is there upon these shelves? How much of it is mere covers and fly-leaves, and title-pages, and blank pages, and errata, and indexes, and tables of contents ? How much is fulsome dedi- cations, and needless prefaces, and superfluous notes, and vain repetitions ?-oh, how it keeps dwindling and dwindling away--the really solid, weighty, pre- cious thoughts do not occupy a hundredth part ol that showy assemblage--yon- bulky Encyclopedia, for instance, how much exploded learning it con- tains: Law and Gospel in its day, but now proved to be unsound, almost worthless; what folly it would be, to plough through all that rubbish; that dainty collection of British Poets there, fifty vol- umes strong; are.there no conceits, puerilities, plagi- arisms, is there nothing false, indecent, blasphemous, under those sumptuous bindings? Sift them fairly, thoroughly, and whata frightfully scanty residuum of genuine -wit and sound sentiment is leftthose goodly rows of law-books, too,-is it all wisdom and Equity, and Truth, that is reposing: under those stout buff covers?            - Is it presuamptuousiireverent to say that a very large portion of their contents is mere quibbling, and: hirspHtting, andwordtorturing, and cobweb weaving? That ponderous work upon the Logos,   MUSINGS OF AN INVALTD.   101   there-in four plump quartos-is that all solid gold ? a gem of purest ray serene," or not ? Is it a privi- lege, a luxury to read it? Has it done the slighest good in its day and generation, or is it likely to in those that are to follow ? Is it a monument of wis- dom, or of folly? If of wisdom, what a blind, stupid, unappreciating community has it fallen upon; were it brought to the hammer this night, not all the persuasive eloquence of a Keese could raise a bid for it, unless some stray pastry-cook happened to be present. That Shakspeare, there, in twenty substantial octavos-how much of that vast space does the divine bard himself occupy ? not a tenth-the rest is crowded with wordy, windy commentators-what business have they there, smothering the poet alive in this abominable man- ner ? For one single note that sheds any comfort- able light upon the text, there are a hundred that are mere exhibitions of spleen, or vanity, or arro- gance. Who wants to wade through such trash? one's time: would be far more profitably spent in fishing or shooting. But if it were all fine gold, if every page of every.one of those books were worth reading, what fblly to be bending over them for- eyer-why surrender one's freedom, even to such masters ? Far, far better, to be sure, than an igno-  - 1 02    MUTTERINGS AND minious slavery to -Rum, or Cards; still, is it not a perversion of one's faculties, a wretched investment of one's time? an abuse, sure to recoil at last upon the head of the transgressor-oh, let me be warned then in time--let me fly from these fatal fascina- tions-let me go forth and read the great volume which the Lord himself hath written. Why waste alln my precious hours on these erring, imperfect transcripts? Why be contented to pick up all my knowledge, at second hand? Who so silly as to linger over a picture of Niagara, when the glorious original is athand? Would he not be a ninny, who would keep kissing the miniature of his mistress, when the sweet lips themselves were by, and smil- ing upon him? And am I not just such a fool, to stay here, poring over these musty books, when I can see for myself all these fine, and wonderful, and mysterious things in nature, and the heart of mat? Let them go, then; were my picture gallery all Olaudes, and Salvators, and Coles, I would not be - aprisoner in it give me the veritable -blue sky, and the dancing brooks outside; yes, better abandon for ever the-society, even of Hamlet and Prospero, even of rRosalind and Imogen, if it is to cut me off from all other-from all' intercourse with the wise men, and :harming women, and dear children about me.   MUSINGS OF A INVALID.     103 WHAT a wretched morning I have had of it-- thank my own miserable folly therefor. Satan, indefatigable angler for souls, ever on the qui vive for victims, appeared before me, some two hours ago, with a magnificent mint-julep in his claws, got up by one of the most clever and fascinating of his imnps, confound him--and I, like a greedy pike, devoured it--sucked it to the dregs; of course I have felt horribly ever since; oh, what inexcusable weakness, what infernal infatuation! What, did H then, for the sake of a little momentary gratifica- tion, thus deliberately insult my stomach, oppress my brain, turn myself, for the time, into a perfect numskull? Yes, even so-oh fool -fool, fool-so we go-the same old story, from Adam down-tempta- tion, yielding, misery, ruin--frightful words-on what page of human history are they not to be found?    And yet, was I not far more sorely tempted than Adam  was?    Did any apple ever grow in Eden, one half so seductive as that delicious, that rascally julep? no, no; so fragrant, too, so picturesque, so alluring to eyes, nose, palate -is it strange that I  was captivated by it, this warm summer's day? that pyramid of ice, with its rose-colored summit, looking for all the world like an  iceberg lighted up by the setting sun -that   104      MUTTERINGS AND charming combiiation below, of strawherry, and pineapple, and mint, and: sugar, and old mellow peach, and venerable cognac-plague take it, who would have believed that such amarvellous specimen of art was of the devil's own handiwork, a snare laid for souls, a smiling traitor? Ah dear, when will a wolesone beverage be half so inviting? why are we so cruelly tempted? Even now, in the midst of my sufferings, silly wretch that I am, my fancy will keep dwelling on the charms of that insidious poisonl; nay, I fear, that were the very same temaptation presented tome to-morrow, I might be mad enough to fall disgracefully before it. Shame, shame, shamel How can I ever expect to fight my -way to the gates of heaven, if I have no more strength-of will than this? Alas, I shall never see those blessed gates; I am not hero enough to carry tthe dy;, I am too fond of comfort and self-indul- gence; I love to have my nerves tickled, my appe- tites humored; I have no relish for briers, and rocksi and tempests; I&sdere no: crown--no laurels :for:these. brows-that shabby nightcap becomes them better; well, well,-the great majority of my brethren are quite as bad, as sensual, as selfish; thlere's a mean kind of consolation in the thought, Is there nsot?

And do not our own guilty, perverse hearts echo back its truth? What right have we to future happiness, living and acting as we do? Frightfully mysterious as the arrangement seems, who dare question the right- eousness of it? No, whatever my destiny may be, let me at least have the decency not to mutter and grumble over it; what claims have , pray, on my Creat6r? What good am I doing, that I should be spared, even here, much less, rewarded hereafter? What business haver I in heaven? a fellow like me, who has no control over his, propensities, but who tumbles, most disgracefully, as I did this very morning, into the very first temptation that lies in his path. No, "the economy of heaven is dark,?' but who dare say it is unjust? who dare deny that the great mass of men are vile sinners?-that evil 5   1,06      MUTTERINGS AND thoughts, words, actions, outnumber the good, even as the pebbles of earth outnumber its diamonds? It is awful to think of the amount of open, unblushing villany that is going on continually in the world; but when we add to it the hundred-fold greater sum of secret crimes and vices-when we think of the multitude of private drunkards, and gluttons, and gamblers, and libertines there are-and liars and slanderers, and scandal-mongers--when we think of- the manifold hidden villanies of trade -of the countless falsehoods daily told at coun- ters, false marks, false entries, false manifests- of the abominable tricks, quackeries, rascalities that degrade- professional, life-when we think of the frightful accumulation of slang, and trash, and filth, *- *and profanity, and bestiality that is for ever going on, in all sorts of dark holes and corners--and, saddest of all, when we think of the innumerable meannesses, and pitiful jealousies, and unjust sus- picions, and sour looks, and harsh words, that are perpetually rqarring the comfort of firesides, and poi- soning the peace of families; oh is it not enough to make us hide our heads in shame for ever?

How can we evade the solemn requirements of justice? "It is the eternal law, that were sin is, Sorrow and shame must answer it." That we can get round it, that we can sneak into heaven, as it were, by means of a miserable death- bed repentance, what folly, what mockery to sup- pose it. No, the penalty must be paid, and to the full. After all, how profoundly indifferent and reckless most of us seem- to be about the matter. So long as we have the use and enjoy- ment of these dearly beloved senses of ours, we are quite willing to postpone spiritual pleasures indefinitely; and as to spiritual sufferings, why they are generally dismissed with a laugh or a sneer. To be sure, a relative or friend will die, now and then, and we may be scared into a little thoughtful- ness and self-examination, but it is soon over, and away we go again to the old appetites and employ.   108      MUTTERINGS AND ments; as tyrant Richard: with his drums and trumpets, drowned the voices of an outraged wife and mother, so do we seek relief in the din of busi- ness, and the whirl of pleasure, from the remon- strances of reason and conscience. When these bodies turn against us, when they are no longer faithful servants, but have become positive encumbrances and nuisances to ourselves and all about us, then, indeed, it is high time to be alarmed, and to mani- fest some little interest in the world of spirits; when, at last, the summons to quit comes, "that fell arrest without all bail," when the paws of the monster are upon us, when there is no escape, but go we must, then the dread truth. flashes upon us in all its hor- rors-then the judgment to come has a stern, earnest, terrible reality about it, from which we shrink back in despair. Oh, what a miserable set of cowards, then; how we cling to life; what remedy so loath- some, that we will not submit to it? what quack so vile, that we will not hearken unto him, if we can but have a :few weeks, days, hours' respite from this horrible consummation? anything but this-languor, pain, squalor, ignominy, mouldy bread and filthy water in a dungeon; anything under heaven, so we keep this side the grave; but we whine, and plead, and struggle in vain; too late, too late-the day of   MUSINGS OF AN.

What saith the dread record? On such a day, in a fit of savage, causeless wrath, I felled a poor old faithful servant to the earth. On, 3   MUTrslRINGS AND  such a day, my best friend and benefactor was vilely slandered, and I, mean coward, stood silent by; he died, soon aftr, a broken-hearted man. On such a day, I poured forth torrents of cruel, biting sar- casms, that sent my poor mother weeping to her bed-planting thorns in her pillow, whom I should have died to serve. On such a day, when I should have spoken, I uttered not a word, no, though a few kind tones and smiles might have saved that mother's heart from breaking. On such a day-but oh, God, spare us, spare us the remembrance of these horrible thingsl Can any bigot conjure up a hell more terrible than the gnawing memory of deeds like these? Well may you shudder, guilty, trem- bling sinner, at the prospect of such tortures close at hand; no evading them, now; what, think you, that a few vain confessions, tears, and prayers will pay this frightfil debt that has been thus long accu- mulating? no, no, no. And how long are these torments to last? How long is the poor soul to be thusleft to prey upon itself, ere kind mercy inter- pose?  Alas, is it possible that, knowing and feeling these things to be so, I can still go on, day after day, piling error upon error, transgression upon trans- gression? 'Even so, just such miserable, infatuated creatures most of us seem to be.   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.   But are these things so ? Are men thus wicked, deathbeds thus terrible? Is retribution a thing so frightful? Are we all such vile wretches?   Is trade, then, a mere pack of lies and frauds ? Are professional men a mere gang of swindlers and pick- pockets ? Is there no high standard of honor and morality in public life? Are families so wretched ? Are there no happy firesides, no loving hearts, no generous impulses in human nature ? God forbid, that any man should be found, to utter a thing so absurd and monstrous-there are, there are good men to be found all about us, in the highways and in the by-ways of life-and pure and lovely women, angels before their time, who go about doing good, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, comforting the distressed. " Blessings be on them and eternal praise" therefor. But oh, are there not more, far more unfledged d6vils around us, certainly amongst the men ?-fellows who do their master's bidding here most faithfully, and who will be amongst his trusti- est agents hereafter. Yes, busy, crafty, cursed fiends in hell. I can't help thinking so, though I shall, no doubt, be called a cynic, and a misanthrope, for ex- pressing such an opinion. Ah, here comes my hearty, jovial friend     . I wonder what he thinks about these things--he certainly does not   "2      MUTT"RINGS AND look as if he troubled himself much about such speculations-what a bluff, ruddy visaged fellow he is, to be sure-here he comes, puffing away, as usual, at a fragrant Principe-let's see what he has to say -.uponthe subject. But I know what he'll say-he'll only laugh in my face, and call me a blue-skin-he evidently considers such sentiments as mine so much old fashioned Calvinistic cant and humbug; or, at best.,a sick man's whims--the Voice of Dyspepsia, not of Truth. He thinks this world a very com- fortable, respectable one, and its occupants, on the whole, a pretty decent set of fellows-as to Death, he only dreads it as a means of -withdrawing him too soon from thebanquet of life-so long as he can get a full meal of this world's pleasures and excitements, he has no notion of worrying himself about the nex xt- well, it is not strange. He certainly has, everything that can make this life agreeable-a palace to live in, a bright, cheerful family, every comfort, every lux- ury-high health, too, an unrivalled digestive and locomotive apparatus, and a gay, devil-may-care temper. HBe is, moreover, a large holder of .overn- ment and State Securities, which command high premiums-he has his Bonds and Mortgages too, as solid and substantial as the round globe itself- nothing can shake them, save a second deluge, or   MUSINGS OF AN INVALTD.     113 the-great final fire-no wonder that he has a good opinions of a world which treats him in this hand- some, liberal manner. He would be quite resigned to stay here a century or two longer, on the same terms-oh that I could only give him this rickety constitution of mine for the next twelve months, and get his glorious one in exchange-a precious bar- gain for him, to be sure-would he still chatter away so agreeably, still wear that pleasant expression, think you? And yet such an experiment might be the very best thing in the world, for both of us- might teach us many lessons well worth learning. Yes, we are both wrong-my views of life are quite too bitter and gloomy, his altogether too reckless and superficial. If I need the cheering, genial in- fluence of health, he is quite as much in need of the wholesome discipline of sickness-his conscience is getting quite too drowsy-his inner man wants stir- ring up--he ought to be scared out of this gay Epi- curian mode of living-he has no right to take the world so easy, when there is so much wretchedness and ignorance around him-he has no business to squander away his time and money as he does, on fleeting pleasures-what a world of good he might be doing, this very minute--there are, no doubt, now, -poor wretches absolutely starving for want of work,   "4      MUTTERING8 AND within a stone's throw of that costly house of his- if he knew it, he would relieve them, I am sure, amiable, kind-hearted man as he is-but why does he not know it? why is he not hunting up these poor, suffering brethren of his, instead of lounging along the streets in this pleasant, nonchalant way? what has he been about all the morning?

What, am  I to turn life into a mere entertainment, run away from all its duties, devote myself exclusively to the gratification of my appetites and fancies, and shall I not be called to a most strict and bitter account for it hereafter?

Precious little good does it seem to have done you, in the way of mending your temper and character- for aught I see, you are quite as worldly, selfish, and sensual, as the gayest, heartiest buck in town." Too true-too true-yes, we are both of us sadly astray -both miserable invalids, so far as spiritual health is concerned-pitiful paupers in all that constitutes true riches--worthless, worthless indeed, such lives as ours-what is there noble, or even respectable, about them?

Like a fool, in- stead of submitting silently and patiently to this shower of abuse, I got mad in return, and replied in the same strain, and so, before we knew it, there we were, like a couple of belligerent tom-cats, spitting   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     119- and sputtering and growling, our backs up, eyes glaring, and very whiskers trembling with wrath -luckily a huge table was between us, else we should have undoubtedly resorted to the ultima ratio - of fisticuffs--as it was, we kept up for a good half hour a pyrotechnic display that would have done credit to Vesuvius himself-till, finally, the absurdity of the scene seemed to strike us, all at once, and a hearty fit of laughter restored us to our senses-he apolo- gized, I explained, we shook hands-then we had another hearty laugh, and parted, at last, as good friends as ever. Ah dear, what a pity that a man so well meaning and kind hearted as he is at bottom, should yet be so utterly without self-government- one would suppose that the infinity of scrapes and annoyances that this peppery temper of his is for ever getting him into, would teach him wisdom- what a dance it has led him, to be sure-how many black eyes it has cost him-how many streams of claret has it set flowing from that fine Roman nose of his-how many nights at watch-houses, commit- ments for contempt, actions for assault and battery, challenges, expulsions from theatres and concert rooms, in fact, all sorts of disagreeable experiences, have been occasioned by this sad infirmity.

Oh, how wrathy he gets-it is as much as he can do to keep from throwing it, dish and all, right out of the win- dow-he has actually precipitated a dictionary into the street, for not containing the word that he was looking for.

What a pity that he should be afflicted thus-that he should carry this devil about with him wherever he goes, to torment himself and everybody else. Will he ever change?

Somewhat grandiloquent, to be sure, still there is a hearty, earnest enthusiam about it, which is quite charming; who can help using large words, when talking about such amazingly large things?  Who can help being taken off his feet at times, when he thinks of the wonderful things in store for this dear land of ours?-when he thinks of the magnificent picture which the valley of the Mississippi will present, a century or two hence.

Still we keep rising, and now we can no longer hear the hum of the busy hive beneath us, or the pleasant sound of the church-bells; but what a grand and glorious map is spread out around us; we are looking down on happy homes, and well-tilled fields, and cheerful workers, and frolicking children, and comfortable flocks and herds;- no grim castles, no dismal convents, no huge   MUSINGS OF AN INVALnID.     127 unsightly barracks deface the picture; but there are churches, and school-houses, and colleges innumera- ble, scattered all over this glorious valley; tall fac- tories, and stately warehouses full of corn, wine, and oil; depots, that look like towns, filled, too, with the products of all climes; there are thousands and tens of thousands of swift steamers, for ever run- ning on the errands of this great multitude; trains of cars, whizzing along continually; telegraphs without number, speeding over the wires, inces- santly, their magic messages from north to south, from ocean to ocean.  Still we soar and soar, and now the great Mississippi seems a mere thread of silver, and those tall trees upon its borders the tiniest of shrubs, and that vast city that crowns its banks, why, it looks as if you might stow it away in a toy-box. That little fairy spot on the opposite shore is the far-famed cemetery--Auburn is vene- rable, Greenwood is charming, but this far exceeds them both in beauty-where else, on earth, will you find such trees, and fountains, and winding walks, and  exquisitely carved monuments?

Would not its occupants be turned into abominable slovens, blackguards, ruffians, thieves, murderers?  Who can doubt it? Even were we permitted to live out our days, who would take life on such terms? What, a world where there are no mothers, wives, sisters? No, no, the sooner such a planet went to the dogs, the better-it wouldn't be worth saving--dreariest, forlornest part of the universe, it could not be knocked out of it too soon-the very angels would turn their heads away, as they flew by it.

Hang the old raven!-why the deuce didn't he stay at home? What right have such fellows as he to inflict themselves upon their neigh- bors? Haven't I blue devils enough of my own to annoy me, but he must set his vile crew of imps on me? Besides, there's some shadow of an excuse for my grunting, with my wretched nerves, and rickety- contitution-but he, the old rhinoceros, he ought to be ashamed of himself-why, if he were to sleep out all night, in this gale, it wouldn't hurt him-he'd be as well as ever in the morning, and as impatient for his breakfast-such a break. fast, too-the very bears- would blush to see him at it-he grumble, forsooth--a man, who never had a sick hour in his whole life-a man, who carries   NO40      MUTI'TEINGS AND aboE ut towmwn such a magnificent stomach as he does -why,-if it were put up at auction this day, what a scramble there would be-for it among the epi- cures uwere ostriches the .bidders, there would still be a rush- for it-for shame, man-take a lesson from it; faithful, hard working, unmurmuring drudge, that it is, what a rebuke does it read its peevish, fretful, owner-but why remonstrate?

And oh, how little a thing it takes to annoy me-how trifling a matter will upset this querulous temper of mine; did I not get angry this very morning, at the sight of a few straggling gray hairs in my whiskers?  Did I not rail and pluck at them, in a savage, vindictive spirit ? Did I not curse a faithful old coat too, and the man that made it, for simply parting company with a button ? Oh, is there any mishap in life so trifling and insignificant, that a man of a snarling, captious temper cannot turn it into an engine of torture, and himself into a perfect vessel of wrath, because of it? What folly; why not take things coolly? Why quarrel with the flight of time, the decrees of destiny ? And yet I do; I am angry, this very moment, with the whole rising genera- tion; I am not willing to be supplanted, to be driven off the stage of life-though my entertain- ment has been a meager one, compared with that of many of my brethren, still I am unwilling to leave it, and I frown and grumble because the great Giver of the feast so wills it.

Why is it so? Why has not our Maker endowed us more gener- ously? Why has he not condescended to let us into more of the secrets of his government, the pro- cesses of his works? I am tired of being the in- significant ignoramus and nobody that I am-why, if I were to die to-morrow, I should not be half so much missed from this big town, as a seed from a fig; can it be, that the earth itself is of no more account in the great Universe ?

Am  I not snugly housed, and seated by my comfortable fireside? I've no brothers on the deep-no wines, or silks, or spices, tossing about upon the billows. I can enjoy this wild music and dancing of the elements; at least, can be cool and philosophical on the subject; but they, the poor bereaved and plundered ones, what say they to this vile mischief-making tempest? Do they see the finger of God in it, or the wild, wicked pranks of Satan? Patience, friends, patience; keep your tempers; rebel not, blaspheme not; these are not the howlings of malignant fiends,- no, nor the manifestations of God's- anger; the injuries they inflict, grievous though they be, and hard- to bear, 7   "6      M UL'SERINGS AND yet what are they, compared with the benefits they yield us? Could we get along at all without them? Would the air, be fit to breathe, the world to live in? What a dry, drooping, dreary planet it would be, to be sure. Instead of grumbling, then, ought we not to welcome this glorious gale? Is it not out upon a right royal and beneficent errand? a messenger of love, not wrath?' a purifier, invigora- tor, breathing new life into all the veins and alleys of the earth? preserving the wondrous frame of things about us, in all its strength and freshness? Ought we not to greet all the phenomena of nature, all the dispensations of Providence, in the same spirit? The few casual mischiefs that they cause, are they to be named for a second, with the innumerable, ceaseless blessings that they'bring? Any other view of the matter is heathenish and savage. Oh, 'tis these cursed propensities, these vile passions of ours, that are for ever blinding our eyes  to the truth. Ambition, pride, avarice, sensuality, these are the, false lights that are for ever leading us astray; how can we expect to see our way clearly, to read aright life's lessons, while we keep such company?  Out upon them why can't I turn my back upon them at once, and for ever, and seek straightway the blessed society of the   MUSINGS OF AN INVATID.     147 Virtues?

I have read about them, to be sure, in the good book-have heard about them in sermons -have seen them in pictures--gazed admiringly upon their, sculptured charms, as they grace the monuments of popes and saints; but the things themselves, the blessed originals, I feel that they are strangers to this wayward, perverse heart of mine. How can I expect to be happy, then? to have peace within, or sunshine without? Happy indeed!-oh, no, no--all is disorder, tumult, rebel- lion within me. What right have I to expect any- thing else, filled as I am with false views, harsh judgments, blind prejudices, tormenting doubts, sinful desires?-precious materials for happiness, these. Is it any wonder that I grumble? that I find fault with God's doings? that I am constantly growling at myself, and picking bones with my brethren? Why will I consent to remain in such a state? why do I not rise up at once, and thrust out these vile tenants, that are breeding perpetual warfare and wretchedness in my heart?

What was the use of that long string of attributes, drawled out in that affected way ? why go into all those his- torical details.? what business had they in a prayer? why that painflly elaborated climax, towards'the close? why that awful dropping of the voice at the word Amen ? Why, too, spend a good half hour, piling up this vain mass of words, wearying us all out in body and mind, when a few,brief, earnest, fervent sentences would have been infinitely more edifying to the hearers, more acceptable to God? And above all, how could a pastor, worthy of the name, presume to put such sorry feed as that upon his sheep, in the way of sermon? Meager, misera- ble trash; all noise, wind, gesture; baldest of comT mon-place; not a solitary new idea; not one fresh, fragrant flower of fancy, from beginning to end-; a mere showy humbug throughout; and yet, strange to say, this man is popular; he has a handsome, well-filled church, and a substantial alary.

Was St. Paul himself at all com- parable to him in any of these particulars? and are not these gifts quite as acceptable, in this degenerate age, as fervor, piety, self-devotion, thoughts that breathe, and words that burn? I can't help think- ing, that if the glorious Apostle were alive to day, and were willing to accept a call from this congre- gation, he wouldn't' have the opportunity-three- quarters of them would be for retaining the present incumbent; the other would only make them un- comfortable; would be quite too personal; would be saying all manner of unpalatable, irritating things. He never would consent to having a pro- fane drunkard for an organist; he couldn't sit still in his- pulpit, while a notorious, shameless harlot was officiating in the choir as first soprano--oh, no, he would be breeding a perfect tumult in the church, within a week; as it is, things go on smoothly-- minds lis own business, and, lets the music committee mind theirs;, he sticks to his text, never ventures on unwelcome reforms, never handles for- bidden topics, and see what a quiet, snug, cozy flock he" has of it.

How many real, devoted Christians were there pre- sent this very morning? a poor baker's dozen or so, at most; the rest of us were a mere set of worldlings- vacant, sleepy-looking old people, and restless, flip- pant young ones--how listless, how indifferent! Had the preacher been enlarging on the properties of contingent remainders,. instead of hammering away, as he did, upon the necessity of justification by faith, we couldn't have looked one whit more uninterested or stupid. Had the scene suddenly been changed to the opera, and had Elisler come bounding on the stage, we'd have all been wide awake in a twinkling, I warrant you-what a stretching forth of necks, what a levelling of opera- glasses; -or had Burton come rolling in, with his funny face, and his broad jokes, we should have been, instanter, bright as buttons. Oh, what abomi- nable perversion, what an insult to the great founder of our faith, to put his name to such hollow, worth- less services is these I Do we not need another Paul, indeed, to stir up these stagnant waters, to alarm these slumbering consciences, to create a thorough revolution and reform in the church?

On the way home, stumbled on  ,  ; he looked as cold, sour, bitter, as, ever--he'd. not. been to church, not he--catch him wasting his time in that way--he don't believe in any such nonsense--but what does he believe in? poor unhappy, skeptic, he has no faith in himself or his neighbor, or his Maker, in the past or the future. History: he considers little better than a string of lices -revelation an arrant forgery--prophecy a clumsy, contrivance of the priests--so with the vir- tues, patriotism, philanthropy, piety-, what are they tohTimn, but hollow, unmeaning sounds?

After he had gone on in this strain for some time, I asked him if, he had read that volume of Channing, which I lent, him the other day.

Men may be tamed down a little-they may not cut each other's throats quite so freely-- may not plunder each other quite so openly-'there may be more intelligence among them-a greater show of right and justice-but what does it all amount to? Is not the devil served just as faith- fully as ever? the nature of those services is some- what changed, that's all-what the men of old times did in a bold, manly way, with their swords, we do in a quiet, sneaking one, with our pens-they took lives, we murder characters--they robbed, with violence, on the highway, we! prefer the peaceable employments of picking pockets and forging signa- tures.

Do you really think that this poor planet of ours has made no progress whatever, in the long flight of ages? Have we not gained somewhat, in the way of manners and morals, upon the men of Sodom and Gomorrah? Is our worship quite as blind and cruel as that paid to Baal, and to Moloch? Has civilization, then, done nothing for the race? Christianity nothing?" "Precious little that I can see-they may have modified the out- side of things somewhat-but is not the same cursed canker gnawing at the heart of man, as ever? - There is less unblushing, disgusting brutality on the earth, I grant you, but are not' our imagina- tions and desires just as foul and abominable as ever?

As for civilization, has it not multiplied the vices of men far more than it has strengthened their virtues?

"Poh-poh-this is mere talk for effect. I say again, I don't see this peace, and light, and progress that you speak of-at least, nothing that will bear inspection and analysis. I repeat it --I don't believe there has been any radical change in the hearts and lives of men, from the beginning. I have no doubt that we are, at bottom, quite as great rogues and ruffians as they were when the keel of the ark was laid-to be sure, the school- master has been abroad, very extensively so, since then-there is more enlightened self-interest in the world-we are beginning to find out the folly of fighting eternally-or rather, we quarrel more with Nature, less with our fellows-we- are not such blood-thirsty savages, perhaps, as we were-but still the spirit -of fight and selfishness and rebellion rages within us-the objects of our passions may have changed somewhat, but the passions them- selves, are they not alive in our hearts, in all their fury and venom?  What folly, then, to represent it otherwise--to assume that we are so much better than our forefathers--to put on this jubilant, saucy, self-righteous tone, so fashionable in this preten- tious nineteenth century of ours, and in this coun-   t568     'MtU'?1iERBTINGS AND - try- of loud talkers--the-idea that there is any substantial, difference between the Americans of to-daya, and the -Greeks and Romans of two thou- sand years ago- humbug-humbug-humbug." "I differ from you-I think we do present a much more respectable appearance; that we are much more acceptable objects in the sight of our Maker, so far as decency and sound morals are concerned, than the men of old-you yourself admit, too, that. we have gained wonderfully upon them, in the way of knowledge-that we know far more about the earth we inhabit-about the heavens above us -that we have made precious discoveries, in all- -the kingdoms of Nature, that they dreamt not of." "I am not so sure of that-at any rate, the facts will not justify our bragging in the way we do- just look at the matter a moment--here we have had possession of the planet, heaven only knows how. many thousand years, and how much have we really found but about it? How much of the mere crust of it have we faithf lly explored, and subju- gated to our purposes:? How much of it still be- longs to the beasts? How much is in the exclusive possession of the elements? We are fond of boast- ing of ur -victories over, these last, but when- they -reay arise, in their..might, what a wretched fight   MUSINGS OF AN tT, INVATD.    I we make of it! A pretty figure truly does the great lord of creation cut, when the tropics send forth their hurricanes, and the poles their squadrons of frowning icebergs. They, too, the venturesome fel- lows, who have tried to find out the secrets of these polar regions, what have they gained by the exper- iment? Where are they? Shall, we ever know what has become of them? - With all our wit, skill, science, will we ever be able to find them, or even bring their poor frozen bodies home,- for Christian burial? Pretty fellows we, to crow about -our ex- ploits-why, we haven't yet had wit and energy enough to cut the two anericas apart-we still keep sending our ships thousands and thousands of superfluous miles, wasting alike lives, time, and money--it seems as if we wouldn't take the broad- est hints that Nature herself gives us." "But, my friend, be reasonable-these things require time-- don't forget that our Continent only hove in-sight four centuries ago." "True, and is not that fact itself a perfect satire on the enterprise of mran?-a very spirited, industrious set, to be sure, who have been so many ages finding out the limits of their place of residence Ah I had we been the energetic, excellent set of creatures that you try to make us out, the world might have been worth living in.   160      M ABI*1'hINGS AND, But n-o-then as- now , men- have ever preferred fighting and frolicking and destroying, to working and. studying and doing good-who does not .prefer lolling over . novel, or lingering over the wine-cup, to digging into a dry book of mathematics, or going about hunting up objects of charity!

"True-but has not a great change come over the:iworld, of late? - If we have been, hitherto, little better than a set of worth- less ignoramuses, as you seem to think, are not the prospects ;ahead very different? Has not a new era dawned upon society?  I think- so. I think the astounding discoveries of the day, in physical science, are the precursors of wonderful revolutions, not :only in.: the face of Nature, but in the character of man. Is:there not, already, a restless energy, an insatiable spirit of curiosity abroad, that will not be quieted? a determination to explore, and sift things to the bottom? -Is there not an amount of intel- lectual capital employed, in all sorts of great enter- prises, without all-parallel in the experience of the past? It really seems as if the earth were at last   MUSINGS OF AN INVALTT.     161 to be thoroughly overhauled,-the wilderness to be invaded, in right earnest--the wild beasts to be ferreted out of their dens-savage life to be put an end to-the hidden treasures, the dormant mineral wealth, the latent water-power of the planet, all to be brought to light, and pressed into the service of man. A grand new crusade seems to have com- menced, to which the famous ones of old were mere trifles-what were they, after all, but so many su- perstitious, sanguinary expeditions; and for what? to recover a small patch and corner of the earth from the clutches of infidels. Now, we mean to re- deem  the whole length and breadth of it from rugged, savage Nature, and to win it over to the blessed dominion of civilization and Christianity- nor is our victory to be won by mere fire and sword -oh no-no such vulgar weapons for us. Steam and Lightning--they are the instruments that are to. work these wonders-to bring about this glorious revolution-to bring the nations together-to cre- ate a grand interchange of interests, ideas, senti- ments, all over the globe-to give us all, at last, a common language and a   common faith-yes, to turn the whole race into one grand, peaceful, lov- ing, thriving family.

As to the dawning of a new era, I certainly do think that phrase better adapted to a Fourth of July Oration, than to the conversation of sensible men. Nor do I believe the day will ever come, when there will not be a pretty large assortment of wild beasts on the earth, and a fair sprinkling of savages-they may have to change their quarters from time to time--but while Commerce and Civilization are making one place too hot to hold them, Decay and Desolation will ever be on hand, to furnish them   MUSINGS OF AN INVArT.    163 with another. As to men being in any great hurry to become a band of brothers, I really can't see any violent symptoms of it, just yet-or that the English language is going to supplant all other languagcs or that all other religions are going to be swallowed up in Christianity. Such vast pre- dictions seem to me little better than the absurdities of Millerism." "Ah well, we don't agree upon these matters, that's very evident-I think you wrong, both in depreciating the past, as you do, and in supposing that the future is to be a mere repetition of it. I think, as I said before, that a magnificent drama has already begun in the moral and physical world, and that America is to play the leading part in it-that the developments which another cen- tury or two will bring about, will be altogether un- paralleled in human history. What a spectacle will the Pacific and its shores and islands present, by that time-what myriads of beautiful steamers will be ploughing its waters-what stately cities will line its coasts-how will its now quiet, desolate gulf and harbors be filled with life-what an inter- change of men, and merchandise, and knowledge- yes, we shall carry Science, Art, Religion, to the remotest wilds of Asia-we shall put new life in her old veins-make a new Continent of her-root ('   164      MU'TT'RINGS AND out her miserable superstitions and despotisms, and give her in their place the priceless blessings of Liberty, and Education, and Christianity.

I must take the liberty of differing from these gentlemen. I can't help thinking that the nineteenth century, at least, will be gathered to its fathers,; before the cultivation of the Anglo-Saxon language and literature will be considered a neces- sary part of the education of the young men of Tobolsk, or eke of Irkutsk; nor do I believe that there will ever be a very furious rush for the Waverley Novels in Kamschatka.

Will not London and Paris, by that time, have become as miserable ruins as Balbec and Palmyra now are? Shall we not be losing as much on one side of the planet, as we are gaining on the other? I have no more doubt of it than I have that the planet itself, by this time next year, will have got round to the same part of the heavens through which it is- now whizzing. But I have no time to discuss further with you the possibilities of the' future-the realities of the present are waiting for me, in the shape of dinner. And so I must bid you good morning." A strange genius. We might have talked till sunset, without agreeing-and yet, I am quite too prone to indulge in the same gloomy, doubting views of life, myself-can they be the true ones? Oh no, no. What better evidence of that, than the very influence they exert upon the temper and conduct? how souring, depressing,   MUTqlEINGS'- AND paralysing If we-persist in. cherishing them, we are sure to become misanthropists, and, probably, unprofitable idlers-perhaps, alas, before we know it, poor miserable drunkards.  It is very easy to give wayt to them. There is a sneaking kind of comfort in dwelling on the worthlessness and monotony, of existence-in reading the future by the past-irI seeing the same eternal dreary round, alike in the experience of life and in the move- ments of the stars; in talking about the littleness of man, and of earth-it is easy to say that this planet of ours is of no more consequence in the great creation, than a solitary grape in a vineyard; it amuses the fancy, to dwell upon such images- but is there any real truth or soundness in these notions?  Do they who express them, believe them in their very 'hearts ? Are they not at war with all our best affections, our loftiest aspirations? Had men really cherished them, would they have ever done the little good they have in the world? No, it would long since, have become a mere sty for hogs, How absurd and impious, too, to sup- pose that God should have lavished so much power and wisdom and goodness, in behalf of a set of beings, who, frail, ignorant, sinful that they are, have yet reached the highest point to which they   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.   ever can go; to suppose that-this earth is to wit- ness no grander exhibitions, moral or intellectual, than it has already witnessed  Has then the planet seen its best days ?

Are all future human performances on this great stage to be, at the best, mere wearisome repetitions of the past ? If so, indeed, then the curtain cannot drop too soon; let the old orb go, it cannot be reduced to cinders too quickly; and yet, it seems had to destroy a world that has already produced its Washington, its Shakspeare, its Raphael-one can't help feeling that there are glorious things to come out of it yet-one can't help looking forward to magnificent results, from all these mighty movements in educa- tion and colonization, from these World's Fairs, and Conventions of all kinds, Religious, Political, Commercial, Literary, Scientific, Artistic, that are being held continually, both here and in Europe.

Well, the law will do them jus- tice; poor fellows, they might have hanged, drown- ed or starved, or ever he would have given them a stiver, while living; and now, this sudden ava- lanche of riches comes rushing and tumbling in upon them, and will, no doubt, be the ruin of them.

Besides, hasn't he had things pretty much his own way, all his life? Hasn't his voyage been a smooth and-delight- ful one, from the very start? No, no, no-far from it-he has had his full share of squalls and storms -his full allowance of losses and bereavements- grievous and bitter ones, too-"no man, indeed, has had more to test his temper, and thoroughly search his heart-and how triumphantly has he icome out of his trials-how nobly has he borne his lossesI It  is not many years since he had to part with his wife -such a wife as she was-no lovelier woman ever brightened a home--he knew her-he appreciated her.

To be sure, he has made no distinct profession of Reli- gion; he seems to be mightily indifferent about sects and creeds .and ceremonies-too much so, per- haps..  heard him say, indeed, once, that he did not care the toss of a copper whether his faith had thirty-nine articles in it orthirty-nine hundred, and   MUSINGS OF AN INVATID.   187   that it -did not make a straw's difference .to him, whether the minister officiated in a surplice or a roundabout, so long as his heart was in the matter- he has a frank, incautious way of expressing him- self on these subjects, which of course exposes him to misrepresentation. fHow many precisians are there, who would have rolled up their eyes in pious horror at this very speech, who, so faras the essen- tials of goodness are concerned, are not even worthy to black his boots! For, though thus negligent about the mere forms of Christianity, has he not, all his life long, been faithfully practising its vir- tues? Has he not been conferring benefits, forgiv- ing injuries, bridling his tongue, subduing his appe- tites, drying ten thousand tears for every one that he has caused to flow?

And why may I not hope to meet him hereafter, and hear him, in some brighter world, talk over his earthly experience in the same agree- able strain in which he chats about old times here?

Well, I deserve it; I have disobeyed the doctor's injunctions; have been using my head and neglecting my heels, and I have got to pay for it; yes, this is pay-day. Doesn't this hot, throbbing brain tell me so, plain enough? these dim, heavy eyes, these relaxed muscles about my mouth, this dry skin? Oh, how restless and nerv- ous I feel Hso irritable, too; couldn't I fire off a volley of oaths, now, that would put the profanest postilion in France to the blush, that would make the most voluble vetturing in Italy whistle in his amazement? What disagreeable things and per- sons keep coming into my mind continually I I was even now having a half dozen visionary bouts at fisticuffs all at once, with as many rascally acquaint- ances. Didn't I see them afterwards, too, all group- ed on the boiler-deck of a Mississippi steamboat, the captain drunk, the engineer asleep, the boat driving along at a furious rate-crack, crack, crack went the boilers, and these same fellows were all blown into the air, and down they came again with a splash into the water; poor, scalded, mangled, slaughtered wretches; surely, my heart bled for them? not a bit of it, not a bit of it; I was tickled, positively tickled at the sight; I all but gave three cheers; had Beelzebub himself been by, I could      Oo -      MtcrERmINGS AND have shaken hands and exchanged congratulation with him on --the occasion. For shame, man, fo: shame!I how can I give way to these diabolical feel ings?--and there is that blessed Bible, too, all this time, lying on my table; how dare I look it in the face? And. is this the frame of mind for a Chris tian to be in? this the course of conduct prescribed in the Sermon on the Mount? I'll read a chapter it may do me some good, perhaps; may bring me back to reason. Ah, I have opened on th very sermon itself--"And seeing the multitudes, he wend up into a mountain; and when he was set, his disciples came unto him. And he-opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, Blessed are the" but no, no, no; let me not insult these divine beati- tudes; let me not profane them with my lips, feel- ing, as I do, my heart to be all full of gall and bit- ness. Oh no; railings and cursings are far more in keeping with my temper- "Lay on, Macduff, And damned be he who first cries hold, enough." that's the way I feel-that I can comprehend and sympathize- with--yes, I can relish the tremendous emphasis-which the frenzied, desperate Macheth lays on that word, damned. But those sublime   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     191 benedictions, alas, I feel them not-I understand them not-Lear cursing his daughters, Timon hurl- ing his imprecations upon Athens, Othello sum- moning black vengeance from her hollow cell, these things I can enjoy, can dwell upon them with savage pleasure-wasn't I repeating the last oi those passages to myself, this very minute, with wicked glee? . "Yield up, O Love, thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate-swell, bosom, with thy fraught, For 'tis of aspics' tongues--"  Ugh, how fine that last line is-I think I hear the hissing of ten thousand hellish snakes in it. Fie, fie, fie, why will I cherish these angry passions? let me be patient. It /s hard, though, that I should be treated in this way--that I cannot be allowed to take a little mental food occasionally-that I may not, once in a while, treat the immortal part of me, without my body's kicking up this infernal row and uproar about it, reminding me perpetually of the vile bondage to which I am subjected. Don't tell me that life is worth having on such terms as these -so far from its being a boon, I call it a downright dose. Confound it I I am cheated both ways-I am defrauded alike of the rational enjoyments of the   192      M U'lThrEINGS. AND man, and of the sensual gratifications, the high health of the beast. I wish, oftentimes, in the bit- terness of my heart, that I had been a quadruped- why wasn't I a Polar bear, for instance? I should have got far more out of life-what strength, what an appetite, yes, what glorious endowments of wind, limb, and stomach, would have been my portion- I could have run 'my hundred miles a day, and swiam my fifty-what hearty hugs, what stirring fights I should have had-what magnificent meals of fish, and seals, and young whales in their season, with every now and then a brace or two of Green- land babies, by way of change-what long cozy naps, too, free from nightmares, all through the winter-what charnming summer excursions on the ice-wouldn't it have been delightful?-such a pleasant circle of enjoyments, such an unfailing round of excitements. Oh, would not such a career as this have been quite as satisfactory to myself, as acceptable to the Creator, as the tame, paltry, good- for-nothing kind of life that I am now,leading? Ah, well-submit-submit-submit-this sneering and grumbling will not mend the matter; 'tis so written; 'tis decreed that I must go through the world, a poor cripple, an ignoramus, a nobody-I must descend, a very numskull, to my grave--the   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     193 golden gates of knowledge are barred against me- the avenues of ambition, business, philanthropy, I may not explore them-the flowery paths of plea- sure, they, too, are not for me; they are reserved for stronger heads and nerves than mine. Well, most people would say, perhaps, or at least their actions say for them, that this last is, after all, the only loss worth grumbling about-the idea of fretting over the want of learning, reputation, fame, and such like windy humbugs, why how silly-why shouldn't I get along without them, as well as nine hundred and ninety-nine thousandths of my brethren? how un- reasonable-they don't take on so-no, indeed--they are perfectly satisfied with the arrangement-what care they, forsooth, whether or not their brains- be lined with knowledge, so long as their stomachs are stuffed with good cheer, their purses with hard dol- lars? What care they for the " all hail hereafter," so long as the ignorant present is a comfortable, jolly one?--that's their view of the matter-so they talk, and so they live, and eat, and drink, and sleep, and die, and crumble into dust, and their tombstones crumble after them, and it is as if they had never been. Their names may occasionally linger on the earth awhile, after their owners are gone, i. e., in directories, account books, legal advertisements, and 9   194      MUTTERINGS AND such like precious documents-or on old door-plates or umbrella handles-their faces may survive awhile in atrocious portraits-but these mementoes are soon Licked out of the way, and it is all over with them-so far as posterity are :concerned, such fel- lows are of no more account than the very flies that bit them, the very hogs that they devoured, when living. "Well,"says one of them, perhaps, in reply, " well, be it so, what care we? posterity be hanged-are the learned, and powerful, and famous of the earth any better off, in the long run? are they any happier in their day and generation? This fame, that you keep talking about, is pretty poor pay, after all-a pretty shabby return for all the sleepless nights, and anxious days, and aching brains it costs-what difference is it going to make to a poor fellow, whether posterity gets wind of him, or no? whether a frail cross of wood is stuck up over his last resting place, or a huge pile of marble, carved all over with extravagant allegories and pompous lies in Latin? My next door neighbor is a famous man--no doubt he will be remembered, and his books be read with pleasure, a thousand years hence, while I shall be forgotten the very moment that my debts are paid and my estate set- tled-but what folly to worry and get mad about  MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     195 it--meanwhile, am I not haying tenfold more fun and pleasure than he ever dreamt of, for all his noddlefull of knowledge?

Give me a jolly time of it with my contemporaries- secure me that, and posterity and ancestry both be hanged, for aught I care." Well, the man's honest- he avows, openly, what the great mass of us do, in our actions-and yet, what sentiments!-how flip- pant, how reckless, how utterly unsound!-what, do you mean, then, deliberately to say, that the plea. sures of the senses, the short-lived enjoyments that the bottle, and the harlot, and the dice-boxcan give a man, are the only part of life worth having? and do you dismiss, with a sneer of contempt, the pure, deep, inexhaustible delights of the student? You epicures and profligates, then, are the only fellows that are on the right track, that are getting anything for your money, and the scholar is wrong, altogether wrong in the matter? Yes, a poor, self-deceiving,- self-defrauding visionary and shadow-chaser-you hardly know whether to pity, or to laugh at, his absurd infatuation. Oh, out upon such unblushing impudence, such rascally views of life as these! we are not to be fooled by them any longer-you may   196       MUTTERINGS AND try, indeed, to make them pass current with us; you may dress them up in all the wit of a Congreve or a Sheridan; you may enshrine them in verse more musical than that of Horace or of Herrick; you may wed them to strains more delicious than ever haunt- ed the brain of a Rossini; you may get ruby lips to plead for them, and sparkling eyes to smile upon them, yet we will not be deceived-fascinated, per- haps, we may be, ensnared for a season, but our eyes will be opened at last, to their native hideous- ness-no, we are not going to surrender our free- dom always, to sell ourselves to ruin and despair for such abominable follies as these. Silence, then, ye profane sensualists! we will listen no longer to your miserable sophistries-and as for your flippant sneers and pity, the scholar flings them back in scorn-it enters not into your shallow hearts to conceive of the depth, the fervor, the intensity of h/s pleasures-there is some excuse for his excesses, something honorable in his servitude-yours is an ignominious, ,beastly slavery. Pretty fellows, to talk about infatuation-it is a mighty easy and con- venient thing, too, for you epicures to cry down fame, and the love of it, and to say that it is of no value to a man after death--but what do you know about the matter?-for aught you know, the soul    MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     197 of Shakspeare may be musing, this very moment, in pleasant vein, on the mighty power which his works are exerting on human hearts, and which every hour is extending and deepening-for aught you know, his plays are already performed, (ay, and altogether finer ones than he wrote on earth) in half the planets of the universe-such audiences, too, as he has had--Homer has heard them, and Virgil, and Dante, and Tasso, all his glorious brother bards of olden times-for -aught you can say to the contrary, all these gifted, l;lessed spirits may, even now, be holding sweet converse together. Of course, you will sneer at all this, and reply, fudge! humbug! silly dreams!-be it so; I believe in such dreams my- self-I believe they do a man good, keep him out of mischief, keep alive a holy enthusiasm in his heart, inspire him with a lofty ambition, put a new meaning and beauty into all the scenes of earth, all the phenomena of life-your sensual, skeptical no- tions are fatal to all that is good, venerable, lovely. Precious fellows, you, to sneer at musty books, as you call them-why, what would have become of the world without them?--a world without any his- tory or poetry in it?-a prettyplace to be sure. But why waste one's breath, arguing such a point? you are not in earnest, in avowing such abominable sen-   198      MUTTERINGS AND timents-you know well enough, that if they were faithfully carried out, men would, ere the next genera. tion had fairly got its growth, become so many filthy swine, this beautiful earth a vile pen-oh, no, 'tis mere reckless, desperate talk-" wild, whirling' words with which you would fain drown the voice of conscience. If you would but listen to that voice, would act up to your real convictions in the matter, if you had the courage to throw your bottles to the dogs, and to take to your books, forthwith, and in right earnest, what a glorious revolution we should have of it, what a delightful world we should have to live in. But when have men ever had that courage? Have not flesh and sense had it pretty much their own way always? Has not appetite carried the day against reason from the very start? Did not Noah himself, whom God took so much pains to savre-did not even he, ere the earth was fairly dry, most shamefully forget himself, most in- gloriously fall before the fascinations of the wine cup? Have not his descendants, from that day to this, hailed with frantic delight everything that had intoxication in it, everything that could help them run away from their consciences and their, duties? Did they not greet with wild enthusiasm the fatal, accursed tobacco, enemy of the race?--did it not   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     199 take like wildfire, circulating with incredible swift ness all over the planet, while the poor, innocent potato, man's true friend and nourisher, was over- looked or despised, and only after long years of struggle, found its true place, and was duly recog- nized amongst the choice gifts of heaven? And have we not always been just such fools in our selections? always hugging the poisons to our bosoms, and turning our backs upon the wholesome pleasures of life? evermore crucifying our bene- factors, throwing stones at those who have come to us with words of wisdom and of warning, while we have been prompt to greet with acclamations, to tload with honors, any wretch that would cater to our appetites, that would enlarge the circle of our indulgences? And would you wilfully foster and de- velop these sensual, devilish propensities of our nature? Would you consummate matters by taking away our books and oar meditations? Are we not sufficiently bestial already? With all the counter- acting, elevating influences of religion,- and science, and art, and sentiment, are not the great majority of us, now, little better than so many cattle, roam- ing about with our heads to the ground, with no eyes save for the garbage under our noses? -But enough of this-this may be a true picture of human   -200      MUTTERINGS AND nature-it certainly is a sufficiently gloomy, per haps bitter one.

Ah, dear me, what a humbug of a life--I have been turning over some fifty books, at least, this morning, from the 'Holy Bible down to Kicklebungs on the Rhine, and not one of them can I get interested in-even 's frothy, windy editorials are too deep for me--what a precious condition my immortal soul is getting into-what an ignorant imbecile I am fast becoming-were I to die to-morrow, what a shabby figure I should cut in the next world-what could I tell them about the place I came from?-a stupid traveller, indeed--my company wouldn't pay at all -they wouldn't be civil to me-the very angels would give me the cold' wing--I should make as sorry an exhibition of myself as my countrymen too often do abroad, when over-persuaded by their better halves, in the evening of life, to take a peep at the antique portions of the planet. Some fine summer day, at some Swiss or Rhenish table d'hote, one of these worthy men finds himself suddenly confronted with an intelligent foreigner, who, ad- dressing him very politely in French or German, begs him to favor him with some few explanations on certain difficult, abstruse points, connected with 9*   202      MUTTERINGS AND that beautiful but complicated structure, the Consti- tution of the United States. What-a situation for our friend; he is just about as competent to .the task as a youthful negro, kicking up his heels, in naturalibus, in the streets of Congo or Loango, would be competent to furnish an elaborate de- scription of the steam engine-poor fellow, what should he know about the matter? has he not been toiling like a galley-slave all his days; working, working, working, night and day, day and night, up to his very eyelids, in soap, or lard, or rum, or sugar? his only approach to anything like literature, being a hasty perusal of the morning papers? what, the old Harry, does he know about the scenery, his- tory, government of his country? why, to give any clear answers to the questions proposed, even in his vernacular, would be a terrible undertaking for him; but as to airing his views on these points, in any other language, the bare idea of the thing would make any acquaintance of his whistle. Unfortunate man f how gladly would' he exchange the sublime scenery around him, for a snug berth in Simms' hole; how willingly he would make for the anti- podes, cheerfully taking all risks of central heat, en route;-how he stammers, blushes, stutters, mutters, and, finally, with a convulsive pantomimic move-   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      203 ment, refers the stranger to his wife, who, somehow or other, contrives to get him out of the scrape in what she, doubtless, considers good French. Just such a shabby, sheepish, pitiful figure should I cut in the other world-what information worth having, could I give them about this earth of ours?-what know I of its scenery, antiquities, history, laws, man- ners, usages? of its trees, flowers, fruits, rocks, mine- rals, water-courses, birds, beasts, fishes? why, the humblest science in the circle, the meanest art on the list, what sort of an examination could I stand upon it? Yes, I shall go out of the-world, with no more adequate, intelligent notion of its con- tents, than a traveller would have of the con- tents of St. Peters, or of the Louvre, from    a single, hurried, teazing, bewildering visit. Well- so it is--most true, and most infernally morti- fying. But suppose it had been otherwise-sup- pose I had had Methusaleh's lease of life, and a glorious constitution into the bargain-suppose I had studied faithfully, all that time, making due allowances for all bodily requirements, and had kept my health and faculties sound, through it all --should I not still have died, a comparative igno- ramus? Should I not still have been a mere peb- ble-gatherer, on the great sea-shore of Truth? Nay,  204      MUTTE'INGS AND had I exhausted all the learning that Earth had to offer, in each department, still what a mere mite would it all amount to, in the great sum of truth stored up in this vast Universe-why grumble then, about my ignorance? why not take a philo- sophical nview of the matter, and be resigned? What a strange arrangement, by the way, it seems in our poor eyes,'that all these long lives should have come off, at a period when the world was least interesting. Now, a man might manage to find employment for his ten centuries, but how un- der heaven Methusaleh got through with them, is a puzzler, indeed. Travelling, say you? why, what was there to see, but the face of Nature? fine mountain scenery, to be sure, grand sea views, charming pastoral landscapes--but one soon gets tired of mere Nature. Art must come in, after all, to make the thing really interesting. Where were their cities? Small, scanty, unentertaining ones, doubtless-their roads, narrow, rough, tedious. How did they get along without steamboats, and railroads, and telegraphs? no penny press, then- no cheap publications-no theatres, operas, ballets -no world's fairs and crystal palaces--little or nothing in the way of manufactures, commerce in its cradle, navigation of the most timid, creeping   MUSINGS OF AN INVATLT),    2ds kind--why, what was there on earth/ to live for? That, one would have said, would have been the time, of all others, to have put men on the short allowance of threescore and ten--now, when the world is so crowded with objects of interest of all sorts, we might easily use up fivefold that amount, with pleasure and advantage. Is it slanderous to suggest that these dear old " earliest inhabitants" of the planet must have been far less witty, bril- liant, and intellectual than their short-lived descend- ants? exemplary as many of them were, were they not somewhat stupid withal? It is melancholy to think how much of their time must have been spent in dozing, how much in whittling, how much in mere twiddling of their thumbs-anid oh, how did they manage for Tobacco? the idea of ten cen- turies of earth, and no pipe to smoke, is too painful to dwell upon. But what stuff is this I am talk- ing? whither is my whimsical, profane fancy lead- ing me? Well, it took me away from myself, any how-yes, I had positively forgotten, for a moment, what a poor, rickety wretch I was.' But the reac- tion is at hand--oh, it is returning with a ven- geance-that's right-throb, throb, throb away, -hot, rascally head--why not split open at once, and have the job over-my feet, all this while, are as numb o     206    .

Well, while it will not fail to amuse and edify the neighbors and bystanders, why might it not also be of service to me? a service- able counter-irritant? it will soon bring this vile blood to the surface, I warrant me. Why not be peppered and bruised in that way, as well as be locked up between two rascally mustard- plasters? 'tis only a shorter cut to the desired result.

I take them quite coolly. I can hanker after the dainties of the epicure, the laurels of the scholar-I can get mad, because I may not extort the applauses, sway the hearts of my brethren, and, all this while, the great, the glorious, the only object in life worth living for, is within my grasp, and I do not even lift a finger towards securing it-true, I may not be vigorous, or rich, or powerful, or renowned- but oh, may I not be, if I will, kind, and forbear- ing, and forgiving, and charitable? I cannot take towns, or conquer languages, but I can subjugate this vile temper, can overthrow these villanous passions of mine.

And yet, is your mere goodness worth having, after all?  What signifies a kind heart, unaccompanied by any vigor of body or mind? praiseworthy intentions, with neither health, wealth, nor talent, to aid and abet them, and bring them to any practical account? who wants to be an amiable nobody? an exemplary cipher? to have a character so intrinsically feeble and insignificant, that it is of no manner of consequence to the world, whether it be in repair or in decay, in cloud or in sunshine. Such a spectacle, is it not almost as mel- ancholy as to behold brilliant talents enlisted in the service of vice? nay, far more so; for there is always some hope of reclaiming the one, but what under Heaven can ever be made out of the other?-a good- natured imbecile, forsooth. If that's the part I have got to play all my life, I'd rather leave the stage at once; to be a poor, silly cripple, indeed; not worth the crutches that hold me up; too feeble to defend myself; too stupid to contribute one solitary item to. the comfort or happiness of those about me; a mere cumberer of the earth; can it be that I am fast get- ting into that condition? if so, let me die, die, die,   MUTTERINGS AND             i forthwith and have done with it. I ask again, what is mere kindliness of disposition worth, unless it be allied with quick wits, sound nerves, untiring ener- gies? then I can do something with it; can bring it to market; can make it serviceable to my brethren and myself--on such terms, the game of life is worth playing; the voyage worth pursuing; otherwise I am for making for'the very first port. But is this a sound view of the matter? Is it not, rather, the language of an impatient, rebellious spirit? Be- sides, can there be any goodness, without intelli- gence -how unreasonable, how absurd to talk in this style; mere goodness, forsooth ? why, what does the very idea imply, but quick perceptions, warm passions, a hard struggle, a glorious victory? What has imbecility to do with it ?-'tis an abuse of language to associate them-and as to poverty and sickness, do you mean to say that they take from the dignity and value of virtue ?-charming doctrine, to be sure. What, the very things of all others, that most show off its lustre, its divine beauty and preciousness ? No, no; 'tis mere false pride, and sickly ambition that make me feel and talk thus. This is not the language of the beati. tudes; this is not the Christian's view of life; these obscure, passive virtues, that I neglect, nay, shrink   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.   * from, why they are the very ones that Christianity most exalts, most insists upon; 'tis they that form the crowning glory of the character of its Founder; sneer not at them, then, as only fit for cell and cloister, and the chamber of the sick; as if more truly heroic deeds and words were not daily done and uttered, in these same sick chambers, than battle-fields have ever witnessed. Ah! yes; to be devout and patient and unmurmuring and forbearing and unselfish; to stifle one's resentments, to withold words of com- plaint and reproach, to be ever ready with words of love and kindness, these are the real virtues after 'all-worth more, far more, than the active, showy ones that figure and bustle about camps andcourts- these you are sure of; the others are always more or less mixed up with selfishness and ambition; these are pure, sincere, precious; 'tis these that mlake woman lovely; these that God and holy angels delight to look upon; and oh, the reward that they bring with them-such inward peace, such sweet serenity of mind; shall I ever know it, feel it ?-what are the applauses of the mob, along- side such a treasure as this?  Who would be ass enough to exchange a quiet, unreproving con- science, for all the plate that has been presented, all the resolutions that have been voted; all the  212      MUTTERINGS AND medals and banners and titles and pensions that 4 have been decreed, all the blasts that have been blown on Fame's trumpet, from the Deluge down? And if I will, I may practise these virtues, may enjoy these rewards-who may not?-what corner of earth so obscure that they may not be found there? Who so poor, so lowly, so sickly, so igno- rant, that he can ,escape these duties, can be de- prived of these privileges? And that I should wish to turn my back upon them; should wish to sneak out of life, before my time; should be for throwing up my part, in a pet, because it does not suit my notions, when I might make so much of it if I chose; should wilfully forego such glorious oppor- tunities of being and doing good, and of setting a good example to those about me.

Isn't every popular election a monument of pop- ular folly? Won't it be, so long as this infernal humbug of universal suffrage prevails? -And such a bench of Judges as they have put in--a precious set of fellows, to be sure. Who are they? Who knows them?

That's quite out of fash- ion. Abominable perversion, to be sure; 'tis like preferring a piece of sparkling, sputtering fireworks to a lovely golden sunset-but so it is; noise, fury, glare, mystery, are the order of the day. Who ever thinks, now-a-days, of reading a good, old-fashioned, hearty, natural, sound English novel, like Tom Jones :or Joseph Andrews? We have no stomachs for any such wholesome fare as that-but the sus- picious, high seasoned dishes served up by a Sue, or a Dumas, we can all bolt them down with most frightful avidity., -'What millions and millions of those filthy, fiery French: novels are continually cir- culating through the country; every book-stall, steamboat, rail car, is filled with them-they are- driving all the sound, generous literature of our forefathers off the course.

The ocean itself, we only think of it as a race-course for steamers; hurry, hurry hurry, that's the motto of the age; one can hardly find time now-a-days to chew his food, or pick his teeth, or pronounce his words. It is as much as a man's character is worth to be seen walking deliberately, or looking in at a shop window-he is forthwith pronounced an idler, a vagabond, one who is shirk- ing his duties to society; he himself feels guilty, feels as if the police had their eyes upon him.

There is no dignity, or tranquillity, or depth, or heart in them. Yes, we are fast becoming as fussy, and fidgety, and noisy, and superficial, and conceited a set of fellows as ever made a planet un- comfortable.

Why make this elaborate parade of human weak- nesses? why dwell with such suspicious gusto on the details of all this filth that surrounds you? Would a genuine reformer talk in this style?

Nevermind- don't turn back-don't let your nose run away at the first assault--'twill be a good lesson for it, such a stench as this--we shall relish all the more, too, the pure air and sweet roses at home-come ahead. h, worse and worse-a suspicious-looking neigh- borhood this--don't be alarmed, though-there are our friends with the stars-we are safe enough; to besure, it might be advisable to take off those dainty lemon-colored gloves of yours-they might, provoke an unpleasant strain of remark in these parts. Now come on--ah, viler and viler-what a hole--what crumbling, dilapidated houses, what ragged abandoned-looking inmates. Whew what a steam is rising from these abominable streets.   MUSINGS OF AN INVALTP.      225 Surely this must be the Five Points-what else should it be, but that famous pit of iniquity, the sink of the earth, the headquarters of filth and ras- cality and wretchedness. Ah, you're for getting off, I see, as fast as possible-you have no notion of risk- ing your precious limbs and pockets in such a den as this: itisn't strange; we are amongst a set of horrible wretches, to be sure. What, you shrink from them; you are unwilling to speak to, even to look at these poor devils? for shame, man! you, who are so fond of railing at the vices and miseries of the world, are yet afraid to look them fairly in the face, are for beating an inglorious retreat - the moment that you are confronted with the disgusting reality -stop, man, stop-now that we are here, let's look "into this matter--let's see with our own eyes what this terrible place is made of-terrible, indeed- heavens, what a crew!--what a nest of thieves, drunkards, strumpets, vagabonds of all colors and sizes-see that group of half-naked, dirty brats- poor things, what a place for them-what a school- precious lessons are they learning-no prayers, no hymns, do they ever hear, nothing but cursings and railings and foul, beastly words--such faces as one sees here-leering, loathsome wretches, there is no- thing in Hogarth half so sickening, so appalling--no 10*   H' 6      MUTTERINGS AND wonder one shuidders, and is for hurrying away from them. "And yet, we ought to be here, we ought to come, and realize, and take to heart these sad, dis- mal scenes-yes, man, you, to whom God has given so many good things, on whom he has so freely be- stowed health, and means, and leisure, where could you better expend them, than here? What an opening, what a field of labor for the philanthropist is this. Wouldn't it be glorious now to revolution- ize this spot, to replace these vile haunts with come- ly dwellings, to let in the pure breath of heaven amongst these pestilent streets and alleys, to help restore to order and decency these poor souls and bodies of these degraded brethren and sisters of ours? Come, let's try the experiment-what nobler enterprise could be devised for human wits?

Oh, it must be de- lightful to have conscience on one's side, quietly endorsing all one's transactions-delightful to feel for one's self, and not merely take it on hearsay, that pleasure and duty may jog cozily along tot gether on the same road; that's the only receipt,   228       lJIUTT'EINGS AND after all, for a quiet life, for a peaceful exit-then -we shall have the approving Smiles of the angels, shall be received as welcome guests, as worthy citizens of heaven .

And yet, fortune did not inflict her heaviest, most stunning blows upon him--she neither robbed him of health, or means, or friends. or reputation-but she seemed to take pleasure in annoying him in ten thousand little paltry ways-teazing, badgering, and worry- ing him out of all comfort and patience. Indeed, I don't know that I ever saw him comfortable for five consecutive minutes-something or other was for ever fretting and distressing him--his boots, were always pinching him, or his hat was chafing his forehead, or his coat was cutting him to the quick, or he had a tickling in his throat, or a bleed- ing at the nose, or a spark in his eyes, or a singing in his ears, or some infernal thing, or other, that kept continually reminding himswhat a poor mis-   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     229 erable mortal he was-so was it at all times and in all places-at home, he had no comfort-his wife was always sick, or his servants were drunk-his chimney was all smoke and no blaze-his bell-pull was broken--his beef was cold-his wine was warm -everything seemed to go wrong--at church, he could not enjoy Divine Worship--his pew was always the first to be pounced upon by intrusive strangers-confound them, what right have people to trespass on one's property, in this way? I should as soon think of jumping into a man's carriage, un- asked-he was right in getting vexed about it. The same on C'hange8-'twas his luck, invariably, to be a bull when he ought to have been a bear, a bear when he ought to have been a bull. Did' a new set of counterfeit notes make its appearance in the community? He, of course, was sure to be amongst the first and heaviest recipients-the same in his purchases--if he took a bill and receipt, he could never lay his hands upon it, and so was con- tinually squabbling with insolent tradesmen. The only lottery ticket he ever bought, that drew any- thing, happened to be the very one that he was in- duced to part with, to a friend-his luck, his luck --poor fellow, he seemed to be eternally called up- on to do jury duty, to be served with a perpetual   230      XMUrltlvRtNGS AND succession of subpoenas-he was always in hot water about his taxes and his militia fines--not a moment's peace or quiet could he get out of life- his very watch seemed to conspire against him, and to love to stop, at the very time when he most de- pended upon its going--how many times, in conse- quence, has he been'left behind by steamboats- how many trains of cars have given him the slip, to his unqualified disgust, and the equally unquali- fied delight of a set of jeering porters and loafers- he was for ever running against fresh paint getting spattered by omnibuses, tripped up by dogs, or ap- ple-parings, having umbrellas poked in 'his eyes-- more than Once, has he been, most innocently too, involved in a street fight, and his poor head has taken a shower of blows intended for other noddles --so fared he always-if he went to the theatre, there was isure to be an apology for the very per- former-whom he had set his heart upon seeing. Oh Lord--I shall never forget that night he was col- lared and carried out of the stage box, at the old Park, from his most Unf&ortinate resemblance, as it tiuLed' ut afterwards, to a notorious counterfeiter of the day--ollared just as he was comfortably set- tling hiroself in a most- eligible seat,- for which he had paid some four hundred per cent. premium, that   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     2S1 very morning; and no wonder-'twas a great occa- sion-no less than Fanny Kemble's first appearance in America. Who that witnessed, can ever forget that glorious, delicious personation Of Juliet? Is it strange, that   could never allude to that affair, without using language, strong even unto blasphemy? Poor soul, his last sickness, they say, was quite too much in keeping with the whole tenor of his life-it seems that the stupid old fool of a nurse that waited-upon him, would persist in mis- taking tonics for cathartics, and cathartics for tonics, till the patient was really cheated and worried out of existence, in the most unseemly, disgraceful manner--and when, at last, the breath was out of his body, even then, it seemed as if Fortune were determined to have one more malicious grin at his expense-for while they were rendering the last sad offices to his remains, the hearse that was convey. ing them to their final resting-place, most per- versely, parted company with one of its wheels- this frightened the horses, who began to cut up a variety of most unseasonable capers, to the great an. noyance of the mourners and friends, and the ill- smothered merriment of the heartless bystanders, Is it to be wondered at, that a man thus vexed, and irritated, and pestered, should occasionally have   282      MU'r1TItcINGS AND lost heart and patience? ' Better far," he would say, "to be fairly knocked down, and trampled upon by Fortune-there would be something re- pectable in that, something dignified, something that might lay claim to the sympathies of one's fel- low-men. But to be made a perfect ass, and a butt of, to be the mere theme of her Ladyship's laughter, 'twas more than mortal man could bear." Is it strange, that he should get angry, and fall to curs- ing his unlucky stars-and at times that he should question the ways of Providence, and think it hard that the great Creator, who sees "alike the hero perish, and the sparrow fall," should permit the life of any creature of his thus to be turned into a nuisance and a torment? Well, well, well--peace be with thee, old friend. I trust that thou art now having a quiet time of it, art enjoying a sweet, dreamless sleep, and that when thou awakest, thou wilt enter upon a scene of pleasing duties, of tran- quil enjoyments, unvexed by the thousand annoy- ances, unvisited by the " thousand natural pangs that flesh is heir to." MY good genius took me to the theatre last   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     233 night, to see Richard the Third--ah, what an en- tertainment! I wouldn't have missed it for a good many bushels of gold dust. Never was the usurper in higher health and spirits-never before have I seen one half the amount of exercise taken in the part-such a knocking together of gloves, such a clatter of boots! How he did fly about, to be sure. What infernal faces he kept making up-what an outlay of lungs-what a perpetual making of points, from the very first line of the soliloquy, up to the great final fight. Such a fight, too-there seemed to be no end to it. The tyrant seemed de- termined not to give up the ghost, come what would-punch, punch, punch, went Richmond's blade, through and through him, at leastoa score of times; still he kept at it, as brisk as a bee, as full of sound and fury as ever, to the evident surprise and disgust of his antagonist, and to the great edifica- tion of an intensely excited pit-when he was fairly quieted at last, after a world of kic,king,-and floun- dering, and gasping, then the feelings of the audi- ence were poured forth in such a mingled torrent of yells and cheers, as, young and ardent Demo- cratic Republicans alone know how to give-'twas a glorious tribute to genius-one hardly knew which to admire most, the performance itself, or   234      M UT'ITEINGS AND this cordial, beautiful recognition of its merits. If tradition speak truth, how very flat and stupid, in comparison, must Garrick and Henderson have been in this part--how tame and inefficient the versions of Cooke and Kean-my neighbor didn't think so, though-it was clear that this superb piece of act- ing was completely- thrown away upon him-but then he was an Englishman-a bilious, bigoted Englishman-confound him, in some of the most thrilling passages, I overheard him muttering to himself, what an infernal humbug---and when the curtain dropped at the close, he had the audacity to pronounce aloud the words atrocious swindle, and then rushed out of the box, slamming the door vio- lently after him. Ah dear, such is the force of vile, vile prejudice-the conceited old wretch-as if he had ever heard anything half so fine, at Drury Lane, or Covent Garden, either. And yet, to be candid, it must be confessed that the play was not so-judiciously cast throughout, as it might have been. For instance, was it altogether the thing, to put those two fat, red-faced women, each weighing her two hundred and fifty pounds, in the parts of Lady Anne and Queen Elizabeth? Was there anything regal or interesting in their appearance or movements? Again, were those two dirty,   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.    235 shabbily dressed brats, that spoke so through their noses, and made such frightful havoc with the text, anything like adequate representatives of the lovely i    young princes? Was it in keeping with the char- acter of the timid, amiable, philosophizing King Henry, to be so frightfully over the bay as he was? -so much so, indeed, that he could hardly stand up to be stabbed by the tyrant? Wasn't it rather cruel, too, in the manager, to thrust that poor fellow, who- was evidently laboring with a severe touch of bronchitis, into the arduous part of Buckingham? there were little slips, moreover, in the matters of scenery and costume, that ought not to have been made, in an establishment of such princely re- sources. What right had Richard to woo Lady Anne, in St. Mark's Place, Venice? Why did Richmond address those encouraging remarks to his troops, in a pass in the Tyrol? and, above all, what business had the American flag to wave over the field of Bosworth? Why should the usurper have fellows in his pay, who, by all the laws of dress, ought to have been at Salamis, or Marathon? And why did that individual in the cocked hat and drab breeches perform such feats of valor on the Lancasterian side? Hang him, he was at least four centuries before his time-he ought to have been   236      MUTTERINGS AND- earning those laurels at Saratoga, or at Benpningto:l. But I am hypercritical, perhaps-after all, these were mere spots upon the - sun-the glorious, the magnificent, the intensely intellectual RicharJ. atoned for them all, an hundred-fold. It is, indeed, an epoch in one's life, the witnessing such a perform- ance. 'Twas something, doubtless, to have seen a Siddons, or a Kemble, in Macheth--to have heard the pleasant voice, the merry laugh of Mrs. Jordan, in Rosalind -to have seen the School for Scandal, or Twelfth Night, cast as Lamb describes them-- but oh, how they would have all failed and faded into insignificance, before the superb demonstration of last night! Why couldn't Lamb have been present, and Coleridge, and Manning and Hazlitt, and the rest of them? Poor fellows, they lived a half a century too soon. Ah well, let me be grate- ful, profoundly, lastingly grateful for this unpre. pedented dramatic treat. OF all the polite and amiable men that have made their bows, or waved their beavers, since the Flood, my excellent friend  certainly bears the bell., I speak not of mere skin-deep politeness   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     237 conventional civility-oh, no; his is a thorough- going, bona fide, unremitting courtesy-a suavity springing from the heart, and pervading and ani- mating every muscle and bone of his body. Let him that doubts but behold him, as he makes his entree in a drawing-room, and above all, observe him while he is discharging the arduous duties of New Year's day-what a thorough dedication of the whole man is here to the great task before him; what profusion of compliments does he keep pouring forth--what frequent, earnest, hearty hand- shakings for his intimate friends; what effective and eloquent bows for the rest. What deep duckings and divings of the upper portions-what nimbleness and suppleness in the leg department--yes, a sweep of full ninety degrees, in that last conge. Surely this man means something--this is no joke, but a veritable labor of love. At times, indeed, to say truth, my friend's politeness is almost a source of annoyance to those about him. I have known him, for instance, under the influence of this feeling, per- form, in the aisle of a church, a series of picturesque and animated evolutions, quite as ill-timed as they were well meant, and which have sadly discomposed the nerves of the more sophisticated occupants of the adjoining pews. At other times it is merely lu-   MUT'l'ERINGS AND dicrous. I happened to be with him in the street the other day, when a drove of hogs passed by. Now, is so amiably disposed towards all God's crea- tures, that this feeling, aided and abetted by the courteous practices of near half a century, absolutely impelled him to take off his hat to them. Soon after this occurrence, a most shabby and worthless- looking terrier made his appearance, and would persist in gettihg in -'s way, once or twice nearly tripping him up. Any other man, under such circumstances, would have said very promptly, Get out, with a kick probably, and possibly with some disrespectful allusion to the terrier's mother. All that could be forced out of  was a gentle wave of the hand, and "Make room, if you please.  I even fancied once that I saw him actu- ally bowing to a roast turkey, just before proceed- ing to carve it-absurd as it appeared, I neverthe- less interpreted it into a sort of apology to the great family of turkeys, for the apparent heartlessness and cruelty of the transaction-in the same spirit he would no doubt ask pardon of a rose-bush for rob- bing it of its flowers; nay, of a very mosquito, for injuring it while in the very act of biting him-so deep, so abiding is the kindness of this man's heart. Thus has it been with him, they say, from the be-   ginning; his nurses are reported to have said that he was the best infant that ever drew breath-that when weaning time came, he manifested a spirit of resignation most creditable to him-that amidst all the terrors of teething, he behaved beautifully. His school-mistresses and masters all agreed in rep- resenting him as the quietest, most docile pupil they ever had; that the birch and the ferule, that were plied so continually and so vigorously all around him, never alighted on his innocent little person; they are said to have added, that they did not be- lieve he had ever murdered a fly, or pelted a frog, in the whole course of his boyish career. And yet there are those who, incapable of comprehending so rare a goodness, have utterly misinterpreted these manifestations of it, and have even gone so far as to insinuate that my old friend is somewhat out of his head, which they most absurdly attri- bute to his having been crossed in love some years since-others have impudently thrown out the idea, that there have always been a good many vacant apartments in his attic, while a third class do not scruple to avow that they believe him to be a great rogue at bottom; taking it for granted, that he in- dernnifies himself for all this outlay of civility in public, by all kinds of secret meannesses and ras-   240      MUTTERINGS AND calities. Abominable, atrocious libels these, alike upon his head and heart. He is as intelligent and sensible as he is honest and warm-hearted; he is indeed of the excellent of the earth; God keep him long upon it; we can't spare such a delightful old neighbor and peace-maker; there are quite too few of them in this brawling, wrangling world of ours. Yes, old friend, sero in colum redeas. And when thou takest thy departure, may I be graciously per- mitted to accompany thee. I would fain be by, when thou presentest thyself for admission at the celestial gate. What a profusion of bows, saluta- tions, and acknowledgments wilt thou bestow on holy Peter. I greatly fear that the heavenly Jani- tor, if he retain any portion of the impulsive tem- perament that he had here below, will lose patience and exclaim, "Come in, friend, come in; have done with all those flourishes and fine speeches, and enter, enter freely." And then with what a pleas- ant smile wilt thou greet thy old friends and kins- folk; with what profound respect, with what deep sense of the honor conferred, wilt thou make thy bow of introduction' to the old prophets, and patri- archs, and all the other notabilities of the Holy City.-- But I dare not dwell upon anticipations so delightful, and so must bid thee adieu for awhile, with my humble, but most hearty God bless thee!   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     241 I FEEL decidedly better this bright, beautiful autumnal day--such a day-too good for us poor invalids-we can't- enjoy it-how completely is such a treasure thrown away, too, on your men of busi- ness, your politicians, your sensualists-the poets and the painters, they can comprehend it, can ap- preciate it, can reproduce it with their glorious pens and pencils-yes, this day, doth it not live and glow, in all its brilliant beauty, in the matchless pictures of Cole, in the exquisite poems of Bryant? Alas, the artist's version must soon fade and moulder away, while the poet's will live for ever- will it not be so?-will not that matchless sonnet to October last so long as earth lasts, and its hours, and its seasons?-surely, surely it will. Let me read it again-if I can't enjoy the original as I would like, let me at least make the most of this beautiful copy-true, I have not health, strength, nerve, capacity enough, to hunt up and explore for myself all these hidden beauties and meanings in nature, but I can relish these charming descriptions; can avail myself of the labors of this gifted trans- lator, this wise and kindly interpreter; let me be thankful for such a privilege. How lively the street seems, this morning. Ah, there goes --  , smiling, cozy, placid as ever-   242      MUl'T rINGS AND he's in no hurry, evidently. Did that man ever run? I doubt it; I doubt if the smartest shower that ever fell, could force him into a trot; you can't get rapid motion out of him; you can't fluster him, either, or discompose those'nerves of his, for the life of you; I don't believe the great day of reckoning itself could throw him into much of a flutter; and yet, how dare he take things so coolly? A man, at his time of life, a rational, accountable, sinful man, how dare he manifest such indifference about his spiritual welfare? A  man, too, who has such numerous and heavy creditors all over town, what right has he to amble along in this tranquil, pleasant sort of style? He looks, don't he, as if he was worrying himself about his sins, or his debts, either; as if he cared the toss of a farthing, how matters stood with him, either on the books of his brethren here below, or on those of the recording angel above? not he: oh, no, present comfort, present enjoyment, that's, his motto; he means to have an agreeable- day of it, come what will; he will, probably, spend -the morning cracking jokes, smoking his friends' segars, beating them at billiards; if his wine be well-iced at dinner, and in good condition,-what cares he whether it be paid for or not? You'll be sure to find him at the opera to-night, in the very best,   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.    243 snuggest seat in the house; no man there will enjoy more the pure tenor of Salvi, or the winning ways of Bosio; to be sure, he'll have no right to be there; he ought to be living humbly, frugally; he ought to be hard at work in some honest calling-striving to reduce that mountain of debt, instead of secretly enjoying its extent and elevation, but he won't-; he will, in theory, indeed, cheerfully recognize the propriety of punctuality and honesty; will even express himself, on these subjects, as neatly and pithily as -the Hon. Joseph Surface ever did. But there it ends-the scamp-the scoundrel. And yet, I fear, I am not half so angry with him as a truly exemplary man would be; to say truth, I. fear I am, this minute, rather envying him his high health and his good spirits, than grieving over his delinquencies, or feeling any real alarm about his prospects hereafter. Ah, dear, this reminds me of my whimsical neighbor    , and of his queer views on this same subject of indebtedness. 'Twas only yesterday that I heard him air his feelings on this delicate point. I happened to run against him in the street; I saw at once that he was in a high state of excitement about something. I could not help asking him what the matter was. "Ah," said he, drawing a long breath, ":I ought to be   244      MUTTERINGS AND ashamed of it, I suppose, but the truth is, I have just been paying a heavy grocer's bill, and it goes to my very soul; I cannot- get over it; I feel as if I had been making a fool of myself; I might, just as well as not, have kept the man out of his money for another month; he evidently did not expect it. Confound the fellow! I could see by the quiet grin with which he received the money, and counted it over, that he was having a hearty laugh within, at my expense. Yes, I feel quite angry with myself; I could almost blaspheme about it; I could kick the fellow with a righttgood will; I should like to see a dog flying at him, this moment, or a pugilist damaging his ugly frontispiece. Ah, this is wrong, is downright criminal in me; I know it-I confess it-still I feel so. And what aggravates the mat- ter, my dear fellow, I was ass enough to pay the man in gold, hard, glittering gold; yes, a whole score of bright, new half-eagles. Oh, how could I have been such a fool? Why not have waited a while, and then have discharged this cursed obli- gation by means of some old, ragged, filthy bank- note, with the signatures half eaten away. And if there had been a slight cloud of suspicion hanging over the credit of the institution, why, all the better-then, perhaps I might have felt   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.    245 differently; I might have been comparatively cheer- ful; as it is, I feel small, cheap, wretched."'- "But, my dear friend," said I, " tell me-was not the debt a fairly contracted one?" "Certainly," said he. "Were not the articles good?" "Excel- lent." "The prices reasonable?" "They were." "Have you not had, then, a fair substantial pro quo?' "I have." "Why then begrudge this worthy -man his quid? Why take the matter so to heart? You have but done your duty; but obeyed the authoritative voice of conscience; take comfort then-hold up your head-thump your breast- take a manly stride or two-appeal cheerfully and confidently to the mens conscia recti. How do you feel now? "Cheap as ever," he replied; "yes, it would be all folly and humbug for me to pretend that it were not so. Had I actually been doing wrong, I should not have felt half so bad. But why is this, my friend? Am I so much worse than my neighbors? Oh, am I the most depraved of my race, when I confess to you, that if I had squan- dered this very identical amount on a champagne frolic, or had I melted it--down into a bracelet for some silly girl, I should have been better satisfied; or had I given it to the cause of the widow and the orphan, or to some missionary enterprise, I might   MUTTERINGS AND at least have derived comfort from the publication of the gift; as it is, you see how I feel. Yes, scoun- drel that I am, I avow to you, that I take far more pleasure in the indulgence of an appetite or a senti- ment, or in the gratification of a paltry vanity, than I do in the faithful discharge of an humble duty. Is not this a frightful state of things ? What-am I to do? Perhaps the perusal of some sound treatise on the law of debtor and creditor might do me good might compose me, might restore the balance of my mind. Have you such a work? If so, pray send it to me. Meanwhile, I'll hurry home, and see if a chapter or two from the good book may not be of benefit to me." And off he went; no doubt he recovered himself long before he got home; all he wanted was an opportunity of venting his whims. I; dare say, he was rattling away, the very next minute, about something widely different, but in the same extravagant style, half jest, half earnest; a queer genius-queerer never drew on boots. H6Ww different 'a 'man,; to be sure, from the other; catch him talking- in this way-Oh no,-he would affect to be greatly shocked at such an exhibition of unsound sentiments, of rebellious, reprehensible feelings--enjoying them, sly dog, all the while, in his sleeve, most amazingly. And yet the one, ae-   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.   247   cording to his own showing, is the most punctual of paymasters, while the other never intends to dis- charge a solitary obligation so long as lying and impudence can prevent it; so long as a solitary new victim remains to be plucked. Beautiful resolution, glorious plan of lifel He'll persist in it, though, most faithfully, and I dare say most successfully, to the last-there is a kind of comfort in being fleeced by such a handsome, well dressed, gentlemanly old fellow--who tells such pleasant stories, too, and bon mots, who sings such a capital song, who makes such an unimpeachable salad; the idea of confound- ing such an artist as this with the vulgar scoundrels of the day-the idea of banishing such talent to Sing, Sing--monstrous I How dare you apply to this thorough-bred, delightful performer in the great social drama, such opprobrious epithets as rascal? swindler? thief? fie-fi--fiel ANOTHER  bright, bracing day-Neighbor don't seem to be taking much notice of it though.

HEow does he stand it?-why, wasn't he' in his grave yearsago? Well, there are - plenty like him intown. It seems to be the order of things in'this community; 'tis the spirit of the age; the age of improvement, this; the wonder- working age-of Associations and Corporations; the poor old natural man is fast going by the board, fast being swallowed up in the artificial; the good old-fashioned parts of father, son, husband, lover, are fast going out of the drama; at any rate, they axe no longer the leading Dram. Pers.; their places have been usurped by Voters, Delegates, Trustees, Directors, Cashiers, Secretaries, andmembers of all sorts of Societies. Is not this the tendency of things? Are not men fast degenerating into mere math'les,mere: wheels, big or little, in the great social. clock-work, mere spindles in the great social mill?

So we go; what with our own, and the business of the public, our brains are kept in one eternal whirl-and what do we gain by it? Knowledge, Health, Happiness? not a bit of it; we manage to pick up a superficial, unsatisfying acquaintance with a host of subjects, but have no clear, deep knowledge of any one. Health, say you?--why, it is getting to be a perfect rarity, to see a downright hearty, robust individual among one's acquaintance; such a set of sallow, attenuated wretches as we are fast becoming; why, there would hardly be a bid for us amongst the anthropophagi; pretty soups and steaks should we make for a re- spectable Feejee table; Happiness, say you? How can there be any happiness where the affections are not exercised? where a man wilfully alienates him- self from the only legitimate objects of those affec- tions? makes himself a stranger to his own house- hold? deliberately sacrifices all the precious smiles "'   -: 250     MU[I'EKRINGS AND and tears and intercourse of home, for what? a puff in the papers, perhaps, or a hollow vote of thanks, from some board of cunning directors-precious pay, this; beautiful return for a life of slavish, unna- tural devotion; and yet, how many are continually enlisting in this hard service; how many hundreds if not thousands are there, in every large city of the land, of these same victims of the Public; the flower of whose youth, the strength of whose riper years, the vigor of whose minds, and the bulk of whose fortunes have been sacrificed upon its cruel altars; nay, who have themselves, in the blindness of their idolatry, offered up wife, children, home, friends, faith, everything. It almost makes one wish that there was no such thing as Public Spirit; makes one sigh for the good old patriarchal days, when men used to sit down and chat together at their leisure, under their vines and fig-trees; when they had time to admire the golden sunsets, and the music of the brooks, and the swaying of the branches, Sand- the bright stars above them; when they were not eternally dancing attendance on telegraphs, living at the mercy of ocean steamers, sighing after Extra Heralds at the all-glorious Falls themselves, 'discussing vile politics evenon the sacred summit of Mount Washington-then a man might venture   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     251 forth alone, atr eventide, to muse and meditate upon his Maker, and hmself, the fair scenes of Nature, the deep mysteries of life; be caught at it NOW, and you are set down at once, either as half-cracked, or else as a disreputable vagabond. It really seems as if men must have had clearer minds and warmer hearts in those days; as if their piety had been more fervent, their love more deep; as if all the passions which exalt or degrade our nature, had had more freshness, keenness, intensity; if men worshipped, they worshipped with all their souls; if they gave thanks, they did it right heartily; if they fell to cut- ting each other's throats, they set about it in down- right earnest. What modern battles begin to ap- proach, in horrible carnage, those recorded in Kings or Chronicles?   On the other hand, what modern poet has put one tenth part of the fervor into his songs, that we find pervading and penetrating the Psalms of David? Hospitality, too, the word meant something in old times; in this civilized age, has it not degenerated into a mere interchange of cards and formalities? our Holidays, too; are not the life and soul fast oozing out of them? Thanksgiving, to be sure, still " something smacks, something grows to--it has a kind of taste"-but New Year's Day, is it not fast becoming as cold and stately as a Royal   MU1TTTIERINGS AND Drawing Room ? How infamously we neglect the Birthday of Washington; and even our own Na- tional Birthday, how many of us even begrudge it a handsome, cordial celebration. We are quite too busy, to throw away our time on mere sentiment; yes, altogether too busy to be either patriots or Christians; too busy for the pleasures of home or the enjoyments of Art; at Church, we are restless and eager for escape; at the concert-room, we gape and are fidgety-even Jenny Lind herself can hardly keep us together unto the end of the pro- gramme; at balls and social gatherings we are mute and solemn as if we were at a funeral; this infernal Business it is, that takes the color from our cheeks, the lustre from our eyes-that is fast taking all the heart and soul out of social life. Oh, what a pre- cious consolation, to be told in reply, that we have the honor of living in the most civilized, enlight- ened, and wonder-working age that the sun ever shone upon; that we are better fed and clad and lodged, and are in every way more comfortable than men ever were before; that even we modest republicans can command ten thousand luxuries which Queens could not, two centuries ago; that we can travel ten times faster, and can send a mes- sage ten thousand times sooner, than King Alfred   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.   253   himself could have done-suppose we can, what then? what trifles, after all, are all these things alongside of good health, good spirits, a cool head, and a heart free from care-we certainly are not anything like so strong or healthy or hearty or merry as were these same contempories of Eng- land's glorious King, and it would take a pretty able lawyer, I think, to show that we are substan- tially wiser and better. I MET my irritable neighbor     again in the street, to-day-oh, what a frenzy he was in. " What is the matter, my dear fellow?" I asked. "Why you are as pale as a ghost-fists clenched, too- what are you muttering?"  "The infernal scoun- drel; how I should like to break every bone in that vile carcass of his." "What scoundrel? whose car- cass? I see nobody-pray, what is the matter? who has provoked you thus?"   "Hang him, I don't know who he is-I never exchanged a word with him in my life-I don't even know the dog's niame." "What, and wasting all this wrath upon a tranger? fe, fie, how can you give way to such feelings?" '" Yes, a stranger; but what of that?  254      MUTTERINGS AND Haven't I met him every day now, for the last five years? Haven't we regularly looked daggers at each other, all that time? Curse his"- "Oh, for shame, man, for shame--is it manly, is it decent, to have no more control over yourself, than this? Besides, why can't you turn your eyes away, when you see the fellow coming?" "I tell you I can't- nor he, either, confound him-there seems to be some infernal fascination about the thing--ther'll be a murder, a murder, I tell you, come out of it yet." "But how absurd, how ungentlemanly." 'Oh, you needn't put on that long face-it's mighty easy to preach about these matters. I tell you, I hate the puppy, hate him. Ugh-I couldn't sit in the same room with the scoundrel's portrait, even. Wouldn't I have it down from the walls, wouldn't my heel be through his vile phiz, in a twinkling. I'm glad- I don't know the scamp's name--a dis- gusting one, I dare say-the very-sound of it would make me sick--the very sight of it, on a hotel register, of the initials of it on a trunk would throw me into a fever-ugh l"I saw it was of no use to talk to a many in this condition-so on I went. What a pity, what a pity, that a poor fel- low should be afflicted in this way-that he should be the slave of such a terrible temper, of such   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     255 abominable caprices-how  silly, how paltry it makes him appear. How many men, now, are there, infinitely inferior to him in all substantial qualities, that yet cut a vastly more respectable figure in the world, simply because they can hold the reins, while he cannot-men, too, who having little or no pepper in their own composition, can make no allowance for the frightful preponderance of it in his--phlegmatic, pharisaical wretches, they will even shake their heads, when they hear speak of him-will point him out in the streets to their children, as a terrible example-and yet, there is more real worth, more genuine sensibility in him, than in ten thousand such solemn humbugs. Hang them, when would they ever, (as I have known him do, more than once,) get up from their warm beds, to keep a poor drunken brother from freezing to death? catch them sitting up, night after night, with a sick, friendless stranger. But this man is perpetually doing such things--yes, this very man, who will fly into such fits of causeless wrath at times, who will rave so absurdly, who will make such a pitiful, and at the same time, ludicrous ex- hibition of himself, I have reason to know, has been playing the good Samaritan, in this way, almost every night for a month past. Such is the native,   MltU'tl1SINGS AND radical kindness of 'his heart. Oh Lord, what strange inconsistencies in character one is seeing continually, in this inexplicable enigma of a world of ous. I dare say, the other man, who was the occasion of this sudden explosion of temper on 's part, is just such another' specimen as himself. I have no doubt, that if the two could be fairly brought together, and were to have five min- utes' talk and explaination of matters, it would end in their being fir' friends for the rest of their lives -but it is' altogether unlikely that any such eclair- cissement will ever occur. i It seems fated that most of us should go through the"world without under- standing each other-and so, these men, who ought to be playing Damon and Pythias, this very mo- ment, will, in all human probability, keep up this Same scowling and growling in the street, so long as their powers of locomotion last. Well, well-I can sympathize with them-at least, with the weak part of the". I have just such another temper of my own-no doubt Ishould have got up the same head of steam that   - was under, this morning -at the same short notice too, and with no better reason-nay, did I fi6t, as it was, behave' abomina- bly? I did not, 'to be Sure, make a phenomenon of myself, in public, as he did, but I disgraced myself   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.   at home-and all for what? simply, because my tailor disappointed me. Did I not, shame on me, consign his eyes to the lowest pit?, Did I not, mentally, discharge at his head an incalculable amount of stones, glass, crockery, boots, boot-jacks, filth of all sorts ? Did I not wish him all manner of disasters, by flood and field ? a martyr to corns, a victim to pickpockets, a receiver of bad money, left behind by steamboats, his luggage for ever going one way and he the other, caught in perpetual showers, an eternal sipper of cold coffee and sour claret? Yes, every contemptible wish that could enter into the head of a peevish, whimsical, irrita- ble wretch. Such is this beautiful temper of mine, heightened and embellished, no doubt, by being united to such a lovely, vigorous frame as I have the honor of lugging about the earth. It will never be any better, I fear. I see nothing but fuss, scolding, tumult ahead-weak and wrong as it is, to give way so, still, things don't seem to mend with me-I shall keep it up in this style to the last. I foresee that I shall make a most unseemly, discreditable exodus of it. I shall not give up the ghost, like a good Christian, no, not even like a gentleman-I think I see myself, now, cursing the nurses, blowing up the doctors, railing at my medi-  258      M UTE'I'NGS AND cines, smashing phials, pounding pillows, doing every thing that is disgraceful, and inappropriate- yes, kicking, scolding, scuffling, to the very last verse of the dreary, dismal chapter-what a finale -heigh-ho-heigh-ho! 'Twas my destiny, to-day, to sit opposite that horrible old glutton   , at dinner. Heavens, what an exhibition he made of himself-with what rapidity, energy, inflexibility of purpose, with what awfully destructive results, did he play his part- as to not looking at him, that was quite out of the question. I was completely fascinated, spell-bound^ by the terrific performance. And to think, that at the end of it all, the old wretch should complain of not having his usual appetite. I thought I should -have choked, in the vain attempt to keep my ciuntenance. For more than half a century, now, has this furious trencherman been waging this deso- lating war against the good things of the earth. Vain, indeed, would it be to ask, frightful, indeed, would it be to discover, how many head of cattle, flocks of sheep, droves of turkeys, flights of minor birds, how many shoals of fish, how many tons of   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      259 bread and cheese, how many pipes of wine and ale, have fallen victims, in this sanguinary, this tre- mendous campaign. And still is the old warrior as eager for the fray as ever-still doth that capa- cious, that insatiate maw cry out with the horse- leech, give, give, give-still do those faithful grind- ers ply their ceaseless task. "So was it, when he was a child. So is it, now he is a man." So will it be, till the great Prince of Gluttons shall pounce upon his victim; when, by the great law of retri- butive justice, " this desolator desolate, this victor overthrown," shall himself become a dish. Ah, if this man were to serve his country with one-half the fidelity and zeal that he doth his stomach, what a model patriot our happy land might boast of-or were he to make kindred sacrifices upon the altar of his faith, what a second Luther we should have amongst us to startle and reform this wicked age. Faith, forsooth! the market-place contains the arti- cles of this man's faith; the table is h/s solemn tem- ple; the bill of fare his ritual, and he the most single-minded, the most devout of worshippers. And behold the beautiful results of this devotion. Behold that pot-bellied, crimson-visaged, heavy- eyed mass of flesh and- blood-all symmetry of form, all expression of face lost, swallowed up in fat; all   20O      MU'IJTRlKINGS AND", energy of mind, all alacrity of body, all sensibility to the grand or beautiful, quite smothered, buried alive under that bloated, that unwholesome load of flesh; a conscience, too, that is slumbering on its post;; a; soul, torpid almostunto death--unsightly, useless cumberer of the earth--neither fit to live, nor to die-ere long to be huddled into an obscure grave,8 /unwept, unhonored, and unsung. Is his a grave to be depked with roses, or to be moistened with the .tears of friendship, or of love? Justice forbid. As he soweth, solet him   reap; like a beast hath he elected to live, like a beast, then, let him perish; else what meaning, what value were there in the laurels that clasp the patriot's brow, in the monuments we raise to long-suffering virtue? Still, this gross epicure, this miserable devotee to flesh anid sense, is my brother; ought I not, then, to sympathize with him, to weep over him, to do all- I ca to reclaim him, instead of sneering at or frowning upon him?  "H'eaven  only knows  the power of'the teqmptatioiis that "have thus overcome him  knows what: strange, sad peculiarities of tem- perament he may hae inherited. ; Rebuke him not, then, but aid him to return to the true path--urge him by every possible motive to -abandon this -la, mentable, this soul-starving, body-stuffing career.   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.    261 True, true--but is the attempt a practicable one'? Is it so easy a thing to break these iron chains of habit? Pray, how are you to get at that soul, all the avenues to Wiich are thus obstructed, blocked up? IS it not hopelessly benighted, incarcerated in that vast prison-house of flesh? What tones of truth or wisdom can penetrate those thick walls of sense? What, save the liberating hand of death, can ever let in the glorious light of day upon that unhappy captive? Alas if it be so, indeed- meanwhile, let me look to my own life; let me purify my own heart, chastise my own appetites, frown' down -rebellious and unholy thoughts-let my conscience be ever on the alert, an unsleeping sentinel, ever ready to sound the alarm to virtue; so may I hope to escape those rocks on which my poor erring brother seems likely to perish. HAD a call this morning from my friend He was as hearty, cordial, enthusiastic as ever. He had been to hear Jenny Lind lasts night. How he did go on about' her to be sure  How he did fling the epithets about!"'Such a voice-such a woman; you must go, my dear fellow--you must    262     MUTT"ERINGS AND i not throw away this glorious opportunity." I told him I thought it would be unwise for a sickly, deli- cate man like me to stem such a crowd, to expose myself to any such violent excitements. ' Don't be alarmed about that; I'll see that a good seat is secured for you. Go you must; you never heard such singing. There never was, there never will be anything like it, this side Heaven." And so he went on. He is always in the same gale of excite- ment; 'twas so when Ole Bull was here. I remem- ber going with him to one or two of his concerts. How completely carried away he was-such ap- plause; never were two hands knocked together with such fervor before. If he had had as many as-Briareus, 'twould have been all the same; the wholefifty pair would have been going together, with the same vehement energy. Gabriel Ravel was another of his weaknesses. He seemed to get perfectly beside himself with laughter and wonder at the jokes and the feats of that prince of fun, that amazing Acrobat. He has at times -manifested these feelings to such a degree, that loud cries of order, order, put him out, have been the conse- quence. Poor fellow! he was utterly unconscious, that while rendering this generous, this overflowing tribute of admiration to genius, he himself had   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.    263 all at once become the prominent performer in the scene. It may readily be imagined how such a man would behave on the Rhigi, or at Chamouni, or Niagara, or any of those great headquarters of the sublime and beautiful in nature. Ah! 'tis delightful to see such heartiness, such enthusiasm. It must be confessed, though, that it is not always expended upon scenes or artists that have such a legitimate claim upon it as the above; my friend's judgment is by no means so good as his heart; oh, no; he has made some terrible mistakes in his day. His love of novelty, his hankering after new sources of excitement, have played the mischief with him, at times; he certainly has been severely bitten by some most atrocious humbugs.   What a dance mesmerism led him, for instance; how many trashy books has he bought, how many gatherings has he attended, how many vile impostors have had him by the button, in connection with this subject, for the last five years; all that time has he been on the lookout for amazing developments, as he calls them, for astounding spiritual discoveries; they have not come along yet-they never will come; he himself begins at last to think so, begins to feel that the whole thing is essentially a swindle-- not an unmitigated swindle, perhaps; no doubt, in   264      MUTTERINGS AND all-this chasing after wonders, this hunting after miir- acles, some valuable facts have been laid hold of, some few precious grains of truth have been added to the Treasury of Knowledge; still, who is not con- vinced that the whole 'system, as now paraded before the world, is substantially a humbug, found- ed in fraud, kept up by impudence, nourished by credulity? Hydropathy, too, with what earnest- ness he took hold of that subject, with what zeal did he expend his praises and his pence, in its behalf-what floods of eloquence has he poured out upon it--and what does it amount to? Has any really new and valuable information been commu- nicated to the world? the idea that men have been in possession of the element for thousands and thousands of years, using it all the time, too, drink- ing it, diving and dabbling in it, in every conceiv- able way, and yet, till now, have been profoundly ignorant 'of its true virtues and offices-who's going to believe any such monstrous statement -as this? the idea that water is going to revolutionize all medical science-that the whole Materia Medica is to be swept out of the way, in this summary style, poh! Why, what did the Lord give us all these herbs, and roots, and earths, and salts, and minerals for?- What are we going to do with them? -Nay,   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     2C5 what an insult this theory is, to the great Physician himself, who, with his own kind hands, hath mixed our medicines for us, and hath caused them to spring out of the earth, in copious fountains, and in pleasant places, surrounding them with health- ful airs and charming scenery, as if expressly inviting, urging his children to come, and drink, and be cured-why, every mineral spring-gives the lie to such atrocious pretensions. -  him- self begins to take this view of the subject, begins at least to admit that there is a large infusion of quackery in the system-'tis his way-he is ever ready to recant, on cause shown-ever open to con- viction-'tis delightful indeed, the amiable, cordial way in which he acknowledges his eirrots. Oh, how different from most enthusiasts-as a general thing, what a conceited, petulant, overbearing, domineering set they are; more so than ever, it would seem, in this enlightened age and land of ours-how many are there of these same pestilent fellows, in this very community; most provoking, most inconsistent of mortals. Bigoted Radicals, X persecuting reformers, tyrannical advocates of lib- erty, men who are for ever - prating about truth, progress, principle, freedom of opinion-and yet who are ready to fly into a fever, if you take the   26.6      MUTTERINGS AND liberty of having an opinion of your own-whose whole lives betray the hollowness of their preten- sions-who only want the authority, to be just as great despots, to be just as ready to chop off the heads of their opponents, as ever Persian Sophi was, or Arabian Caliph--he is no such man--no, indeed-he is as kind-hearted as he is impulsive; whether you agree with him, or disagree with him, he is the same excellent friend, the same hearty, genial, glorious fellow. Ah dear me--I shall never forget one absurd scrape that this sanguine, go- ahead disposition of his got him into; 'twas at a time, when balloon ascensions were much more common than they are now.     had long en- tertained the notion, that a little voyage of this kind would be alike agreeable and instructive-he confessed, he had an ardent longing to see how our old Alma, Mater of an earth looked, from that posi- tion-in fact, the novelty and excitement of the thing were quite irresistible-so he made his ar- rangements with    , the aeronant to be his com. panion in his next air-trip-to keep the affair quiet, no announcement was made in the bills to that effect --unluckily, or rather, most luckily, his friends got wind of the thing, but only a short hour or two be- fore the starward journey was to come off-they   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.'    267 were greatly shocked, of course-the idea of his periling his valuable life, in this visionary way-it must not be-no, no--to be sure, no man was bet- ter prepared, no man fitter for heaven, so far as mere human merits were concerned-no doubt he would make an admirable, useful, influential angel, an ornament to the heavenly courts-but he couldn't be spared, yet awhile, he was making al- together too many of his friends happy on earth- there were plenty that might go, if they chose- then, if the parachute were not disposed to do its duty, or if the bag itself should take a notion to burst, they could be resigned to the result-society would probably be a gainer by the transaction. But there was no time for reflections lik6 these- this thing must be prevented-there was not a moment to be lost-where was the man? Nobody could find hihm-as to laying violent hands upon him, at the very last moment, that would never do- a man of his ardent temperament, too-the crowd would no doubt side with him, in the matter-it might end in a most disgraceful row. Ah yes-we have it-swear an assault and battery on him-get out a warrant instanter, and let an officer post down to the Garden with it, forthwith--no sooner said than done-away went the man of law-he ar-   268      MUTTERINGS AND rived in the very nick of time. -----had abso- lutely got one leg over the basket,. when the words, I have a warrant -for you, struck his astounded ear --it must have been a rich scene, that-what, with the bustling movement and eager inquiries of the crowd, his look of mingled amazement and indigna- tion, the mute wonder of the aeronant, and the beautifully imperturbable deportment of the depu- ty, the earnest remonstrance of the disappointed voyager,. his tardy recognition of the supremacy of the law, his final exit under the -wing of the offi- cer, amidst the cheers and jeers of the multitude, altogether, the thing must have been intensely dra- matic-no man appreciated more thoroughly than he did the- absurdity of; the' whole transaction, when it was once fairly explained to him, and. even \i  now, if any allusion is made' to it, he will erow like a cock, for a-good half hour, Well, he'll never change,: I suppose-he'll keep the pot boiling in the same lively .,way, to the close-ever, keeping a bright lookout for- the novelties of the day, ever ready to go all lengths for any scheme that promi- ses to benefit the. condition of his brethren, be it sound, or be it- plausible. And when he goes, surely, no spirit will eyver have left the earth, more thoroughly alive to the wonders and glories in store   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     :269 for it, more thoroughly disposed to render all hap- py about it, in whatever sphere it may be called upon to act. So old    is dead at last-after reeling and cursing about the earth, for the last five- afd-twenty years, he is now quietly under it- yes, he is now put to bed for good-not a tear, not a prayer, not a solitary friend followed him to his miserable grave. Poor, worthless wretch- if from the body of the fair and pure Ophelia, love bade sweet violets spring, oh, what vile net- tles, what unsavory weeds, must needs start forth from thy loathsome and unsightly carcass. Truly, the air seems to be sweeter, the skies brighter, since the removal of this nuisance-there seems to be one. monster the less for dogs to bark at, for-little chil- dren to be frightened at. And to think, that this poor creature was once a fine, spirited fellow, with a handsome, ingenuous countenance, with good talents, bright prospects, with every inducement under heaven to keep straight, and to make him- self useful and respectable; and that he should thus wilfully have thrown himself away, have   2 70      MUTTERINGS AND turned himself into a perfect torment to all about him; have become the theme of alternate mockery and pity to the whole neighborhood; and at last have wound up his career in this frightful, ignomini- ous manner; to think, too, how many millions have done the very same thing before him; how many are doing it now; how many, alas, will do it, even to the very crack of doom I Oh, is it not frightful? Why does tl]eLord permit these things? Why does he not rise in his anger, and extirpate, at once and for ever, from the earth, this curse, this enemy of our race? What other enemy is to be named with it? What are:all the'mischiefs that have be- fallen man, through war, famine, pestilence, ship- wreck, murder, through all other causes put to- gether, compared with the daily, universal, crushing conquests of this Arch-Destroyer?--Nay, what are even its open, notorious victories over human life and happiness, compared with the incalculable amount of secret wretchedness that it is for ever working in the world? Oh how many, many are there, who, while never positively exposing, dis- gracing, ruining themselves, are yet secretly cher- ishing this viper in their bosoms; are clouding their faculties, injuring their good looks, souring their tempers, embittering and shortening their days,   MTUSINGS OF AN -INVALID.    271 for ever manufacturing troubles at thesame time that they are disqualifying themselves to meet the real troubles of life, cheating themselves out of all wholesome pleasures, not making one hundredth part out of the world that they might, either in the way of. duty or of enjoyment Oh what infatuaa- tion, what frightful wasting of one's powers, and one's privileges!--yet, what multitudes are continu- ally throwing away their lives thus--it makes one shudder to think of it. Rum, however, was not the immediate instrument of this poor wretch's death, but chloroform; he resorted to it, of course, for the express purpose of putting himself out of the way, in the easiest and pleasantest manner possible--yes, in this pitiful, cowardly manner did -he' sneak; out of life-perverting Heaven's kind gift to his own vile purposes.  The last sentiment that he was heard to give utterance to, and that with a round oath, was one of utter disbelief in a future state. Glorious farewell speech--beautiful leave-taking, to be sure!-that he was any more sincere than sober, lwhen he made it, is quite unlikely; it was, more probably, a kind of whistling by way of keeping up his courage for, perverted as his faculties all were, he surely could :not have had the insolence and folly to expect any such snug and comfortable   272      MUTTERINGS AND termination to his career as this. What, man, after spending the better part of your life in the service of, Rum; after breaking all the laws of God pnd man; trampling on everything holy and lovely; outraging the feelings of your family and friends; daily brutifying your own nature,-after all this, have you the face to say, that nothing now remains but to lie down, and take a sweet, dreamless, endless sleep? Have you the impudence to hope, that by means of so cheap and paltry a dodge as, chloro- form, forsooth, or prussic acid, you may be able to give the slip, alike to the pangs of Death, and to the terrors of Retribution? oh, no, no, no-there is no need of quoting Scripture on the occasion. Common sense and common justice rise simultaneously from their seats and protest aloud against any such mon- strous assumption, and insist upon it, that condign punishment must and shall be inflicted upon so vile a sinner as this-the nature and duration of that punishment, it is not for us poor, erring, brother mortals to know--but that come it will, who does not feel it in his very bones? else were life a sorry, dreary farce indeed, and human laws a cruel mock- ery. Yes, ere now, perhaps, has this poor soul commenced its long career of suffering-released, at last, from that diseased body, that heat-oppressed   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     2)3 brain, hath -it not already acquired a vigor and ca- paciity, unknown to Earth?

Hath not Reason gained a far loftier throne, from which she can never more be deposed? And must these en- larged capacities, these sharpened perceptions, be ceaselessly directed upon self? Is there no running away from consciousness, no evasion? no skulking behind 'sleep, or ether? no refuge in the bowl? What horrible condition of soul is this, when its every faculty is thus turned into a minister of ven- geance against itself--when every recollection is a piercing arrow, every thought a sentence of death, every vision of the imagination is full of armed and angry spectres. What hell more dreadful could bigot invent, or sinner suffer, than this. It might, perhaps, have been with reference to physi- cal torments, that this poor besotted wretch tried so hard to find comfort in the idea of annihilation -but oh, what are physical sufferings, compared with these? and how long are they to last? for ever and ever? -the thought is too horrible--it can- not be-no, deep and bitter as needs must be--the 12*   3274     'f MUTTERINGS -AND draught: which thepoor sinner is -compelled to take, asr ely, relyely there is .a drop of hope lingering at the:.bottom of the cpap, surely::there is a final day of redemption, and of happiness.

And aliready is that- most'diiigent,: most truthful of his- 'torians hard at 'work tupon the next..

Does the same volume that recites the virtues of a Washing- ton, take note of the humble, unlettered goodness that lies hid in some secluded mountain dell, or that praises God in some far-off log-house of the wilderness? The same historian that lays bare the deep, the Titanic wickedness of a Napoleon, does he also duly mark and brand the petty villanies of every low-browed scoundrel of St. Giles's? Is the same  page, perhaps, whereon are inscribed the sweet hymns and prayers of childhood, stained with the ribald blasphemies of some foul nest of pirates? Is nothing lost, then? What, are all the burning words of orators, the passionate outpourings of lovers, the brilliant sallies of wits, the drowsy speeches of legislators, the quibbles of special pleaders, the mocks of wicked, and the groans of dying men, are they all treasured up in these au- thentic histories? Is it to no purpose, then, that we destroy our .ill-considered writings, take back our hasty words, suppress our evil thoughts? Do they still live, and are they to be published against us?   Horrible, horrible! When, then, oh when are these mysterious, these terrible details to be disclosed? Is it to be on some grand day of au- dience and of judgment, before all the assembled   276      M UrYERINGS AND souls of the children of men? or does each one of us, immediately on leaving earth, hear and receive, according to the deeds done in the body? And oh, what is to be our portion, when confronted with and judged by these not-to-be-questioned records? Where is this heaven, or this hell that awaits us? In what part of the boundless realms of space? These other planets of our system, too, are they -also inhabited by moral and accountable beings, whose daily thoughts, words, and deeds are thus transcribed for purposes of judgment? Are all these systems of the- universe but so many expan- sions of the same great scheme of discipline? or are certain portions of creation set apart as theatres where the great drama of probation is for ever enact- ed, and others' selected for the wonderful realities of retribution?  Which of those two sparkling stars, then, is the abode of the just made perfect, and which the eternal residence of the lost? Or is there no eternal residence for the soul? and are -all these worlds so many points at which we commence, or stages through whi6h we pass, in the progress of a journey that knows no end? Ah, dear! who hath not asked, who is not contin- ually asjring these -questions?-so natural, and at the same time so terrible; so familiar to the mind,   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      217 and yet so utterly inexplicable? Revelation cer- tainly does not condescend to answer them, save in the merest generalities, and Nature's voice returns but vague and indistinct mutterings; the hints that Science furnishes, sublime as they may be, yet are they not far more' calculated to bewilder, appal, overwhelm us, than to inspire or yield us comfort? what a withering, blighting sense of insignificance seems to attach to Earth and earthly things. Vir- tue itself loses heart and is afraid lest, in the mys- terious arrangements of God, it should be over- looked-cheated out of its future existence. Vice becomes more hardened and reckless than ever, as ifit felt sure, through its very littleness, of slipping through the fingers of Almighty Justice. Reputa- tion hardly rises to the dignity of a bubble, and Fame, alas, the loudest blast of her trumpet sinks into the faintest echo of the feeblest whisper-" the great globe itself, yea, all which it inherit" scarcely seems to be an appreciable quantity in the universe, and no more to be missed, were it suddenly plucked out of creation, than a berry would be from a bush, an apple from a crowded tree. But oh, can this be the true view of ourselves, or of our position in the vast scale of being?-no, no-we are not such obscure, such insignificant creatures in God's eyes;   828      MBUTTERINGS AND this dear earth of ours-has not heavenly wisdom contrived it,: planted and watered it, filled it with life and beauty, endowed it with light and motion, Subjected it :to wondrous laws, prescribed for it a glorious pathway in the iskies, entrusted it to guar- dian angels, nay, assigned to it this same celestial overseer and historian, whose labors know no pause, whose records cannot err? Surely some great end is, contemrplated in all: these wondrous plans. CGan that be so very paltry and worthless an object, on which so much thought and care and kindness have been: expended? Not only do mortified pride and alarmed vanity, but reason and good sense also, remonstrate, protest against this belittling view of -man, and his relations to his Maker; this view, which so discourages all that is excellent, and arouses all that is diabolical within us. But oh, how much more potent and triumphant is the voice of Christianity on this: subject!"What, they of no account in his eyes,-;to -whom- God has given, not only so many good things, and; noble faculties, but so many special messengers also, fraught with glad tidings and- solemn .warnings and precious prom- ises?-nay,; who: hath: himself come down from Heaven-- to visit and: enlighten and redeem them?" Happy- the man, who can ask this question in good   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     2-9 faith-who is not shamming in this matter, who is not merely acquiescing in these truths, but in his very heart and soul adopts them, and manfully acts up to them. If these things be so, indeed, what a delightful position he occupies; if they should turn out to be an illusion, still what a charming, glorious. illusion-an illusion that tends alike to cheer the heart and mend the life, to make a man a blessing to those about him, an ornament to his race, who wouldn't cherish it? But, to' look at this matter again, as a poor natural man, is there, after all, in the phenomena which Science discloses or suggests, anything to force us to take such frightfully humble ground, and to make us, out such a contemptible portion of creation? If mere bulk, indeed, is to be the measure of value, our little planet must certainly cut a pretty sorry figure in the skies, alongside of its unwieldy brethren Jupiter and Saturn, for instance. But may we not have the advantage of them both, in matters of far more consequence:? As in the earth itself, there are favored tracts, alike removed from the heat of the equator and the polar - cold, in which alone are to be found the highest mani- festations of beauty, the-rarest exhibitions of intel- lect, may it not be the same thing in the system? may: we not have-a iar more felicitous positio Xiii   z-280      MUTTERINGS AND ,that system, for- the development of physical and intellectual excellence, than either the inhabitants of Mars or Venus, or than those of the greater and more distant planets? may not our little orb, after all, then,. be, far more precious in the eyes of its Maker than its huge brethren? may not our little- selves, with all our crimes and follies, be far nobler pro- ducts of Divine Wisdom, than their inhabitants-a race, for aught we know, of clumsy, feeble-witted, malignant giants? Why not take comfort in that thought, as well as be cowed down by the oppo- site? May not conjecture, poor, wandering child of ignorance, be allowed to stray in one direction as well as another? But, after all, why indulge at all in 'such vain and -unprofitable conjectures? Are they not quite too much, even for the strongest nerves, the clearest heads, the purest hearts? What right, then, have I, poor, frail, feeble, ignorant sinner that I am, to try to fathom these awful depths, to puzzle my poor brains with these bewil- dering speculations?. Better, far better, confine myself to the humble sphere of duty assigned me, to do all I can, in my small way, towards making W this earth of ours, or at least the little corner of it in which I am called to act, more worthy of the Great Founder---more comfortable, and beautiful,   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      281 and enlightened, and happy--the home of peace and good will-and to leave it, at last, not in a murmuring, struggling, rebellious spirit, but calmly and hopefully awaiting the great mysteries of the future.- "Hope humbly, then, on trembling pinions soar, Wait the great teacher Death, and God adore."
