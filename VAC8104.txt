PREFACE.  I HAVE been gleaning once more in that field where, amid the Spring rains and the Summer sun- shine, my thoughts have ripened for the harvest, and, behold! I come bringing my sheaves with me. Certainly my little book has no lofty claims nor pretensions; but I fondly hope that it may be a guest cherished and beloved by some firesides that it may knock at the doors of some hearts, bringing to them gifts of strength and comfort, of healing and good cheer.

CHAPTER I. "AND SO, Guy, you are straight from the acade- my? Things look as they did eight years ago?" and the speaker pushed across the table, as he asked this question, a cut-glass dish of some antique pattern, brimming over with great purple bubbles of grapes. The guest helped himself to one of the clusters, and, as he held it up in the light, it glowed like a heap of carbuncles. "Just precisely as they used to look. I declare, I wandered out under the old oaks, where you and I have idled so many hours, and it made me feel like an old man almost, to remember what a wide gap eight years made betwixt those old school-boy days and the present ones." "Dear old school days!" said Leonard Talcott, with a thoughtfulness which almost amounted to sad- ness in his voice. "How's the Doctor flourishing?" 7   8     TEMPTATION ,AND TRIUMPH. "He's the same straightforward, keen, warm old soil that he was when we were a couple of jolly rogues under his thumb." "I tell you, Guy," said Leonard Talcott, and he brought down, with very unusual fervor, his hand on the table, "if my faith in all the rest of man- kind were to die utterly out, the thought of that one man, Dr. Reynolds, with his stern integrity, his great, honest, steadfast face, would keep a little corner of light and faith in me somewhere. There is a man, I could say to myself, whom no price could purchase, no temptations corrupt-a man who would go unflinching to the stake or the gallows for what he believed to be right--a man true to his principles to the very core." Just then the face of Leonard Talcott was some- thing to study. It was a fine, intelligent one, with a certain expression of good-natured indifference, which his whole bearing sustained. But just now his look had flashed out of indifference and indo- lence into manliness and exaltation. The better part of the young man's nature was for the mo- ment uppermost, and in his face, as he turned it on his guest, and Guy Kenyon, his old school-fellow and college class-mate and most intimate friend for the last ten years, saw this and felt it. For a moment the latter was silent, gazing on his host. Then he said, more to himself than to the other, "That reminds me of a talk the Doctor had with me about you."   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. "What did he say?-out with it, old fellow!" Dr. Reynolds was one of the very few men whose opinion of himself Leonard Talcott really did care about; I mean aside from that personal vanity and approbativeness, of which the young man had his full share, and which made him relish the admira- tion of all his cronies. "Won't you wince?-some of it will cut close?" questioned Guy Kenyon, a little doubtfully. "I won't flinch. The Doctor's nice mental anat- omy may hurt, but one never gets angry over it, because he never inflicts a pain that he wouldn't spare if he could." "Well, after the recitations were over for the day, he invited me to take a 'constitutional' with him, and we went down through the lane and over the old turnpike, and took the road that strikes west to the mountains--the very road that we used to: go in the Fall .to hunt squirrels and birdsnests, and climb the chestnut-trees.'-' "Go on," said Leonard Talcott; and beyond the words the tone said that the whole scene rose and stood vivid before him. "Well, in the midst of some conversation that went right down into the core of whatever it touched on, and showed it bare for its true worth,- as the Doctor's conversation always shows every thing, the old man stopped short, bent his tall form forward, and looked at me through his spectacles in just the way that he used to transfix us when we   1()    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. were summoned before him after some scrape in which you and I had such a faculty for getting our necks. "What is your old chum, Talcott, doing now?' he asked. "'O,' I said, 'he's taking the world easy after his fashion, having a good time generally, dipping into law a little! A man is n't apt to work very hard when he's got a fortune like Talcott's to save him from the necessity of all exertion.'" "Much obliged to you for holding me up to the Doctor's vision as such a lazy dog!" interposed the young host, with a frown. But Guy Kenyon knew his man, and knew, too, that at the root and core of his nature Leonard Talcott loved and reverenced honesty and sincerity; so the assumed displeasure had no effect. He laughed out, "Well, old fellow, I've said harder things than that, by a long shot, to your face, and you've stood it; so you do n't frighten me now. And the old man ground his great cane with its gold top into the soil, and took off his hat and wiped his grand old forehead, and said, with a force and impressiveness that was fairly awful, because you knew he felt it, 'That fortune will be that young man's curse and ruin, for time and eternity, I fear. When I think of him with his fine instincts and generous nature, with all the splendid possibilities of his life, with all his latent force and power to influence others; when I think of the mark lie might leave on his v/'   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     ." day and generation for good, and truth, too, and think how that miserable gold of. his stands in the way of it all, I feel like crying to God to sweep it all away with one powerful blow. "'Then, the man in him that is being frittered away in mere aesthetic directions, in self-indulgence and indolence, would be roused up to earnest work and endeavors. He needs -what every young man needs to develop his moral muscle-hand-to-hand bat- tling with the world; he needs some strong, noble, controlling purpose to take possession of him, body and soul, to stir him up from his luxurious sloth, ' and to fight for to the death, as every man must fight or be vanquished in this life. But what hope is there for him with that love of pleasure eating into his purposes, enervating his moral forces, pan- dering to his lower physical life, till this subju- gates the higher one? Let him stand alone, with not a dollar in the world, and only his own brave head and his own strong arm, and I should have little fear for Leonard Talcott's coming out right. He's got the elements of a man in him; but,' and the Doctor stood out there just by the willow where the turnpike road intersects the one from the mount- ains, and shook his fine old gray head as he said, sadly, 'he has been rich from his birth, and that shall be his misfortune and his curse.'" Leonard Talcott had been leaning half-way across the great table as he drank- in every word that his guest spoke. You would only have known that he was    12'    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. greatly moved by his fixed attention and a little paleness which came over his face. But as his friend ceased-he put his hand suddenly over his eyes, and did not speak a word. His friend sat still, looking at him with a great deal of solici- tude, almost regretting that he had been so frank with him. But after a while Leonard Talcott drew his hand from his eyes, and they shone with tears now that were rung out of his better self--tears that he was not ashamed his class-mate should see. "Guy," he said, so solemnly that most of, is in- timate friends would hardly have recognized the indifferent, careless, graceful Leonard Talcott, "what the Doctor said was true--I mean that part of it which condemns me. I know I 'm frittering away my time, my opportunities--all that goes to make a strong, vigorous, useful manhood. It's my curse that I was- born with a silver spoon in my mouth." "But, man alive, stir yourself up then, and live down and work off 'the curse with all your moral and mental force." Leonard Talcott leaned over and grasped his friend's hand fervently. "Guy," he said, "do you know that the real root and core of my liking for you --above all the other fellows in school or--college lies in your honest, straightforward, outspoken sincerity? You never flattered me, old fellow, and never praised me without I deserved it. You-told me the truth many   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     13 a time at the risk of offending me; and you'd have sacrificed your own self-interest to my best good any day; and I honor and love you for all this, Guy Kenyon." The class-mate of Leonard Talcott was visibly moved. The two young men, as they sat together in the lofty library, with its massive bookcases on one side, and its rosewood cabinets, filled with all rare and curious treasures, on the other, the sight of which would have made a natural philosopher or an antiquarian glow with enthusiasm-the. two were, as I said, sitting there in the broad lake of light' from the chandelier overhead, in fine contrast to each other. Leonard Talcott, with whom this story has most to do, had a slender, medium-sized figure, with a head finely shaped, about which clustered the thick hair whose deep chestnut would have been beautiful in a woman. His face was not wo- manish though, and the broad, strongly-cut features were not handsome. Dark eyes of a hue that suited the hair, and that had plenty of fire in them, and a good many other things which it took time and inti- macy to discover, and a mouth that usually enforced the expression of the eyes, whatever that might be; such, in brief, is Leonard Talcott in his twenty-fifth year, as he sits in his library to-night. His class-mate is a little taller than he, of lighter complexion, with brown, slightly-curling hair, and deep, penetrating eyes. His features are brown,   "' .   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. open, honest. There is an expression of sincerity about the young man's face that you would be likely to trust in any emergency which renders it neces- sary for one to depend solely upon one's intuitions  of character. There is more thoughtfulness, more " sobriety usually in his face than in his companion's; and he has a slight coldness of manner which repels those who do not understand Guy Kenyon. "Leonard," says the guest, after a little pause, "I felt while the Doctor talked to me as though I'd a good deal to answer for in our school and college lives together. 'If I had any influence over you, I did n't use it to the best advantage. I was too careless and harum-scarum to take your inter- ests and the possibilities of your future much to heart. Those six years I might have done for you something that I shall never have the- chance of doing now; but the remembrance of all that makes me doubly earnest in what I have to say now. Leonard, do n't let the best years of your life go to seed. You have talents, influence, all the things that make a man a force among his fellow-men. Get out of this indolent, diffusive, exhaustive life; concentrate yourself, do something for your day and generation." And Leonard Talcott answered, sadly, "I feel what you say to the quick, old friend and true. But, somehow, I haven't much faith in myself. The old habits and the old life are -strong, and I have n't any strong purposes in life to wake me up   TEMPTATION AND TRIiUMPH.     15 into work and self-sacrifice; and I've made so many spasmodic efforts in the right direction ana come down so flat at last, that I've lost faith in myself. A fellow at twenty-five finds a great many forces against him, both active and quiescent, when he attempts to change the whole drift and tenor of his life. There are his own habits, which get pretty well settled by that time; and there, too, is his own inertia to overcome, physical, mental, moral. There is a small chance for me, Guy." And Guy smiled on his friend a smile in which so much thoughtfulness and sadness mingled, that it was no provocative of mirth. "Leonard, what a misfortune it is that you were born into a for- tune!" "Exactly, dear old mentor! If I were a poor dog now, and had to fight for my bread before I could eat it, I honestly believe that I've got fiber enough in me to do good, stout battle with circumstances; but my bread's baked and buttered," and there was a twinkle in the gray eyes of Leonard Tal- cott.      ^ "More's the pity." Just then the distant whis- tle of the locomotive, caught up and prolonged into a shrill cry by the echoes among the hills, broke in upon the friends. "The down train follows that in half an hour, and I've to reach the depot in that time;" and Guy Kenyon rose up. "Stay over till to-morrow night," pleaded, not   16     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. for the first time, the .host. "We'll have some capital boating on the river to-morrow." "Thank you, Leonard; I'm doomed to stand among the workers, and must be in New York to- morrow noon. Do n't forget what Dr. Reynolds said." "I sha' n't be very likely to if I try. His words will rise up and witness against me, for good or for evil." The young men walked to the front door during the latter part of this conversation; and here they shook' hands and parted, with an apology on the host's side that he could not accompany his guest to the depot, because of his desire to be at home to receive his aunt, who had been in the city for a week on a visit to an old friend of hers. Leonard Talcott never failed in any loving court- esy to the aunt who was -to him more than, alas! many mothers are to their sons. It was a beautiful evening in the early Autumn. The large, solemn stars stood up steadfast, eternal witnesses in the sky, and amidst them hung a full- blossomed moon. The light fell in clear, silver tides on the beautiful grounds and on the old-fash- ioned, picturesque stone mansion, which was part of the heritage of Leonard Talcott. The young owner of the estate walked up and down the veranda with his usual rapid, careless, graceful gait, and then thrust his hands into his pockets and leaned against one of the pillars where the honeysuckles made a scarlet heat.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     17 The broad avenue rolled -away from the stone steps, till the path which wound through it looked in the distance like a silver thread on a dark-green plush; the rare and beautiful shrubbery which filled the grounds stood still, enchanted with the moon- light, and the night wind was not louder than the breath of a sleeper among them. Leonard Talcott looked on all this, and the best part of the man's soul awoke within him, as it al- ways did when Nature called to him out of her inner tabernacle. The power and the tenderness, the nobility and the manliness that made true hearts, whether of men or women, turn to him, was in the ascendant for the time. But it was the misfortune of Leonard Talcott's life that he was a favorite with every body; impressible, susceptible, with a great deal of appro- bativeness, with social brilliancy and accomplish- ments which made him admired, praised, sought for on every hand; and with a fortune at his disposal which indulged him in every luxury that his fancies or his taste suggested, it needed no ordinary moral force and discipline to resist the allurements with which the world crowded itself on Leonard Talcott. He had not resisted them.' But his own words and his own condemnation, wrung out of his higher con- victions and intuitions, shall condemn him. "It's a miserable humbug, after all!" he said to himself, thrusting his hands into his pockets, and walking up and down the veranda; and his fine 2   18     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.  face was thoughtful and troubled now--"a'misera- ble humbug this life of mere enjoyment and aesthetic indulgence that I'm living! Time, money, talents, all wasted in this- way, when I ought to be bearing my part of the burden in the age and the world that I'm living in. Do n't I know, better than any man, even Dr. Reynolds, can tell me, that I'm liv- ing for no purpose in the world? Riding, boating, racing, sight-seeing, and a little studying in the Summer; and in the Winter it is worse than that- with parties and picture galleries, with clubs, and oyster suppers, and operas, and plays! Truly, it's a noble life you're leading, O Leonard Talcott! You've got a reputation among men for a good fellow, among women for an agreeable talker and a splendid gentleman! That's fine capital to carry into another world, is n't it.? For you are neither atheist, infidel, nor sneerer, and believe that this life holds close and eternal relations to another; and, because of this, may be your condemnation shall be the greater. Why don't you rouse up now, and get to doing some good battle with the world, the flesh, and the devil? For you know that disgust, inanity, and despair will, as certain as destiny, overtake you sooner or later, on the road you 're in now." These were the highest moral instincts of Leonard Talcott speaking now. , He did not always talk like this, or see with so clear a vision. Physical and mental inertia, luxury, love of ease, and a keen   relish of outward enjoyment, all combined to drag him down and obscure his perceptions. "I wonder," continued his soliloquy, "if I'd bet- ter face about and buckle down to law, or go abroad; that last looks a little like shirking my work; and then my ill luck would follow me there-the ill luck of being born with a silver spoon in my mouth;" and Leonard Talcott laughed to himself a laugh made up of amusement and bitterness. At that moment a domestic came hurriedly out of the front door,and addressed his young master. "Your aunt has just returned, sir," he said, Half an hour later Leonard Talcott sat in the little alcove just beyond the library, on an ottoman, at the feet of a lady a little past the prime of her years, with a pale, sweet face, about which were parted the silken bands of soft, brown hair, faintly sifted with gray. I am certain that you would have liked this lady's face, with its gentleness, its tenderness, its intelligence; and her voice was in harmony with her face. "Aunt Ellen, it seems good to get you back again, and to be here in my old place." Mrs. Lathrop's hand lay soft among the brown curls. "My boy," said she, "have you got on com- fortably without me? I have n't been absent from you in thought a half hour." "I'll warrant it, when I expressly stipulated you should n't think of me from the hour you left the door till you set foot inside of it again."  20     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. "You always asked impossibilities from a boy, Leonard," with her soft eyes full of pride and-ten- derness. "Come, now, own you've missed me a little, for politeness' sake, if nothing more." "A great deal, aunt Ellen;-" and he lifted up his lips and kissed the lady's cheek as a loving, rever- ent son might kiss his mother's. "There's been a terrible vacuum and sense of loss in the house, so much so that I've abjured it for the last week, except as a lodging-place, and kept outdoors, riding, boating, and hunting; and, for the last two days, Guy Kenyon, your favorite, has been with me." "I 'm sorry that I missed him," said Mrs. Lathrop, a little regretfully. "What did he say to you?" "O , things that made me feel grave--things that you would n't have heard without a strong protest!" getting up and going to a small table on which was a basket of oranges. He took one of them, made a small incision with his fruit-knife, and returned to the table. "A unt Ellen-, Guy's put a new idea into my head." "What is it, my boy?" Leonard Talcott did not answer at once. He con- tinued to tear away the golden rind from the fruit, and then looked up suddenly. "What would you say if I were to go off to Europe for a year?" "O, Leonard!" slipping her arm around his neck, and he felt the shudder that went over her. "Come now, aunty, do n't take it so. You shall go along with me."    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     21 "But, Leonard, I have sense enough to per- ceive I should only be in the way many times, and probably, on the whole, of little service to you." "You would be, aunt Ellen, more than you suspect, keeping me out of many a break-neck ad- venture, into which I should be likely to run my precious neck without you. You never did me but one harm in the world, aunt Ellen." "What was that, Leonard?" asked Mrs. Lathrop, not very solicitously. "You did n't hold the reins quite tight enough when I was a youngster. You let me have my own way a little too strongly; now, when the time has come for me to manage myself, I find it's tough work--very tough work, aunty." Mrs. Lathrop looked sober now. "Perhaps I was not wise always in my over-fondness," she said, speaking quite as much to herself as to her nephew. "But you were all I had in the world, Leonard; for my husband and boys were covered away from my sight; and your father was my only brother, and I had not been two years under his roof when he gave you to me, Leonard; and, as I said, per- haps I was not always wise in my over-tenderness." Mrs. Lathrop spoke the last words in a self-reproach- ful voice that touched her nephew. "Aunt Ellen," he said, springing to his feet, "don't you go to saddling on yourself any of my sins and mistakes. I solemnly assert here, thateif   22     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. there is any thing good, or just, or true in me- any thing that good men shall find to praise where there is so much to blame, and if my future shall have any thing honorable or worthy of pra;i.:,. . arwe it to you, and to the example which your life has set before me of all things that are pure, and beau- tiful, and of good report." The lady looked up at him through her tears, which were only of joy, and her nephew stood before her in all the pride and strength of his young man- hood, and her heart went out to him in a love that was well-nigh -idolatry. And just then tea was announced, and Leonard gave his arm to his aunt, and they went out together to the small table which had been spread for them alone. It seemed good to both of them to sit here once more, and Leonard's smile said this as he received his cup of coffee from his aunt. Then their talk went to lighter subjects of family matters and pleasant gossip of relatives and friends; and at the close of the meal Mrs. Lathrop said to her nephew, "Cousin Esther and I had a little dis- pute about .the time of your great-uncle Jerome Talcott's visit to Europe. There's a bundle of let- ters in some of the drawers in the old secretary in the south chamber with his name- and Brussels on the outside; and as you have the keys, won't you look them up for me?" "Yes, to-morrow." -A'h, on what small hinges turn the mighty events   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     23 of our lives! Mrs. Lathrop little guessed what her question involved, or to what it would lead. And Leonard said, with a laugh, "I must indulge in a third cup of coffee this evening, in honor of your return, aunty." And as she passed the gilded cup to him, Mrs. Lathrop said, with a smile, "Well, Leonard, have you made up your mind about going to Europe?" "I shall stay at home this year I think, and next Winter, when I go to the city, I mean to make a desperate effort and buckle down hard to the law." And so, as it ever has been, man makes his plans and God disposes of them. CHAPTER    II. COMPANY, visiting, social excitement of one kind and another, occupied the month following Mrs. Lathrop's return, and her nephew accordingly found no opportunity of fulfilling his promise of investi- gating the old secretary, till a morning blanketed in low, leaden clouds, with a drizzling, despondent sort of a rain, reminded him of the matter, and sent him up stairs to forage among the old drawers for the bundle of letters which his aunt desired to consult. The secretary was a heavy, old-fashioned piece ibf    24     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.      ,     X mahogany, that had been imported to this country from England by a great-great-uncle of- Leonard Talcott's, -more than a century, ago, when furniture was made more for use than show. It stood, dark and grim, in one corner of a cham-  Hi ber which was only used when the great house had a plethora of guests; and the key which stopd in the  lock had probably not been turned for a half score : t of years. Inside, the old secretary was a curiosity.  : : It seemed to have been especially designed and con- structed for baffling discovery, and would have      served admirably for containing the papers of some    embassador of Philip the Second.   Each large, -drawer was full of various small ones, of little curi- ous corners and compartments, and small doors opening into dark recesses, where all sorts of edicts, : of secret instructions and ordinances might be sequrely bestowed, till the hour arrived for them to see the light.  The young owner examined this ancient piece of furniture, whose interior he now beheld for almost   , the first time in his life, and thus apostrophized it: ' "Really, you belong quite to another age and state of existence, with your infinite drawers and doors, and all sorts of machinery for hiding secret docu- ments and St. Bartholomew decrees. You have a' mysterious, threatening, aggressive sort of physiog-:  nomy, which does n't belong to our broad-daylight nineteenth century. In short, you 're a suggestion of secret dungeons, and conspiracies, and all sorts   TEMPTATION AND TRIU MLH.     2. of political intrigues, and are woefully out of place in this Young-America age." And so Leonard Talcott went on turning the keys in the small rusted locks, and opening the little doors, whose apartments disclosed other sets of small drawers, and these were mostly filled with bundles of letters, and deeds, and bills of sale, tied with faded red tape and ribbon. The great-uncle of Leonard, from whom he in- herited his fortune, including the secretary, was an eccentric and rarely-methodical man, and it was doubtful whether, in the course of his life, he had ever destroyed a scrap of writing addressed to him- self; and the secretary had formed, and continued to be, the sole depository of all his epistolary and business papers. This great-uncle had, by a variety of shrewd and far-seeing speculations, expanded the moderate for- tune which his father left him into great wealth. He was, as I said, a man of many marked eccen- tricities, and some fine qualities of character. His opinions were all stout convictions, which he main- tained with intense obstinacy; he was a shrewd, keen business man, generous and kind-hearted, but of an irascible temper, and much given to odd, out- of-the-way speeches and doingsi being possessed of an aggressive moral independence, which feared nothing, and rendered no homage to established precedents, opinions, or customs of any kind. This man, Jerome Talcott, was a childless wid- 3 26     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. ower. He had two nephews, the sons of his elder and younger brothers. The latter was the grand- father of Leonard; and Jerome Talcott had, in his will, made Lewis, the father of Leonard and son of his younger brother, the heir of his entire property, which amounted to nearly half a million. A little time previous to the old gentleman's death there had been a sharp collision betwixt the old man and the young one on account of a diversity of political opinions; and Lewis Talcott had still further offended this obstinate and irascible uncle, to whom he had always occupied the relation of a son, by a journey to Europe, soon after his marriage, which he made without obtaining his relative's consent. Jerome had threatened to disinherit Lewis, and give his property to the son of his elder brother, although there had been, for many years, a coolness betwixt the families. It was thought that the rich old man might have executed his threat, as he sent for his elder nephew, and received a visit from him; but the sudden death of the former put an end to all the counsels which he took of his indignation. Lewis Talcott was summoned home from Europe, where he was traveling with his young wife, whose delicate health caused him much solicitude, and on his return to his native land found that his uncle's will left him in undisputed possession of the prop- erty. Lewis Talcott had behaved very generously to his elder cousin, who, at least, had every reason to   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.      27 expect that his uncle's last will and testament would leave him a large legacy. Then the young husband settled himself down on his newly-acquired estate, built a large old English mansion on its fairest site, and the world pronounced judgment that Lewis Talcott was blessed and favored above other men. Alas, for the false judgments of the world! In less than three years after he had reared his goodly -home its fair young mistress was laid away under the soiled flannels of Autumn grass, leaving her stricken husband one comfort in his desolation, a little sweet-faced, golden-haired boy, too young yet to comprehend his loss. Lewis Talcott lived three years afterward, the truest and sincerest of mourners; then a sudden fever clutched the strong man, and in a few days he knew that his days were numbered. Mrs. Lathrop, his only sister Mary, was a widow and childless. The two had loved each other with a devotion which rarely exists betweenthrother and sister, and in the very last hour of his life the dying father committed his only son, in words she would not be likely to forget, to his sister's care. How faithfully she had fulfilled the trust reposed in her, with what tenderness and self-devotion, Leonard Talcott would bear witness. The young man did not find the letter of which he was in quest for some time, and his curiosity was somewhat stimulated in his search, so that he   28     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMrH. kept on peering into the various corners of the ancient secretary long after he had accomplished the object of his visit. And as he kept on thoughts of its former owner suggested themselves to him, and the strange stories he had heard from childhood of his strange fancies and eccentricities floated back to his memory. "It is just like him," he murmured to himself- "as full of all out-of-the-way corners, and unex- pected turns, and little surprises in the shape of drawers and doors, as the old man was of whims, and notions, and oddities in general!" Leonard Talcott had not often paused to read the contents of the faded and yellow papers which dis- closed themselves in his search; but at last, just as he concluded he had exhausted the old secre- tary, he touched a spring in the back part of the drawer, and a very small compartment disclosed itself, whose existence one would not be likely to suspect. Some document was carefully folded and laid away here, which the young man drew into the light, and, presuming that some special importance might attach to it from the evident care with which it had been concealed, he- half-thoughtlessly, half-curiously, unfolded it, meanwhile whistling some light tune. But the tune suddenly ceased, and a startled, intense look spread itself all over his face. The young man greedily devoured the old instrument, written more than thirty years ago--greedily de- voured it over and over again, every letter and   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     29 sentence seeming to scorch themselves in fire on his heart and brain. At last he looked up with a white, bewildered face. "What does it mean? Am I awake or dreaming?" spoke Leonard Talcott to himself. He stared all about him. Outside, the low, gray woolens of cloud lay thicker than ever, and the despondent rain of the early day had gained heart and strength, and was beating in a gray sheet against the windows. The old secretary stood before him, grim, and dark, and tall, and it seemed now to the young man as he gazed on it that it suddenly became inspired with a spirit-a spirit that looked down on him, powerful, threatening, defiant--and then Leonard looked on the paper he held in his hand; held and crushed it, and made a quick, fierce movement to tear it in pieces; and the next moment he smoothed out all the folds carefully and tenderly; then he turned and walked up and down the room, and his step, his quick, lithe, ringing step, was uncertain and agitated as an old man's, and his face was white, and the look there was one that they who loved Leonard Talcott best would have grown pale to see. He had entered that lonely chamber that morn- ing the undisputed owner of lands which reached around him as far as his gaze could travel; he would go out  What? The document which Leonard Talcott held could only make answer, for it was the will, duly signed   30     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. and sealed, of his dead uncle, Jerome Talcott, and that will gave every dollar of his money, every foot of his estate, to John, the son of his elder brother, William Talcott! There was- no disputing it. a That old will had at last risen up from its grave of years in the old secre- tary to confront Leonard Talcott face to face, and to tell him that the lands and gold which he and his father had held so long were justly and rightly another's; that he had no claim to one acre of the land about him; that the very roof over' his head was another man's. And then, walking up and down the chamber, with his white face and unsteady steps, Leonard Talcott asked his soul what he should do, what justice and right demanded -of him in this matter. He had always called himself an honorable gen- tleman. His instincts of justice and right were, as we have seen, strong and true; he would have repudiated with high-souled indignation the barest suggestion that he, Leonard Talcott, would not sooner cut off his right hand than do any thing mean or dishonorable; and yet here and now the temptation came upon him with awful power and wrestled with his soul. He saw the whole thing at a glance; saw that if he went out into the world, and proclaimed the discovery he had made that morning, that it would be wresting from him his entire fortune, and that he would find himself a penniless man, thrown upon   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     31 his own resources for his bread and his shelter. No wonder that the luxurious, fastidious, pampered youth shrank from the thought. And then, taking counsel of the temptation which had Come to his soul on that day and hour, he said to himself that no human being knew of the exist- ence of that will, none ever need; all he had to do was to strike a match-and he glanced at the little marble box which stood on the mantle,-touch the small curl of flame to the ,yellow paper, and in a moment it would be a little iblack pile, which the first breath of wind might blow away, and then his fortune would stand on its old foundation, and no earthly power could wrest it from him. And the Temptation whispered its specious sophistries to him that this money was his and his father's before him by absolute right; that Jerome Talcott, in a fit of unjustifiable anger, had no right to revoke the decision of his whole life, and that his first will ought to stand. "And it shall, I say it shall," said the young man grinding the heel of his boot into the floor, and setting his teeth together; and he swung the will over his head, and laughed such a laugh as never before curdled the air from the lips of Leonard Talcott-a laugh made up of triumph and. desperation. "The property is mine, as it was my father's before me. Help yourself if you can, O Jerome Talcott, in the grave where you've lain for more than thirty years i"And the young man drew up once   32     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. more toward the mantle, and then he turned away, sullenly. He could not quite make up his mind to do this thing in the daylight. "I'll come up to- night; that's the time for it," muttered Leonard Talcott; and he went to 'the secretary, and placed the old will in the secret, drawer, among the dust, where it had lain so many years, and went out. Ah, -he was not the same man that went into that chamber three hours before! At dinner his aunt wondered what had come over her nephew, he was in such unusual spirits-full of laughter, talk, and jests; and she smiled as she passed him a second cup of coffee. "Well, Leon- ard, it is very certain that you can bid defiance to all elemental influences, if you can keep up your spirits such a day as this. Why, I was half a mind to have a fit of the blues myself." "Yes, aunty "-setting down his cup with such emphasis on the table that the delicate china rang sharply with the collision-"'I am of the pachy- dermatous kind; and it takes something vastly more powerful than a rainy day to reach any vulnerable spot in me.  I'm weather-proof, physically and mentally." Notwithstanding the storm deepened as the after- noon advanced, the young man insisted that he would ride out, and his aunt vainly- expostulated with him. He parried all her attempts to dissuade him, from going out with jest and expostulation, till at last he came nearer getting angry with her   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     33 than he had ever been since he was a boy. "What is the matter with Leonard?" muttered the lady to herself, as she watched her nephew dash down the avenue, and the gray sheets of rain hid him from her view. He did not return till it was quite dark, and, notwithstanding he was thoroughly drenched, in- sisted that he had had a capital ride. After tea he seemed uneasy and restless for a while; and then his old tender manner to his aunt returned. He came and sat down by her, and, she could not tell just how, led her into talking of her youth, of his father, and of his great-uncle; and one thing led to another, and she went on telling him stories, and he asking questions, till the night grew late-and still the winds rose and the rain strengthened, and there was no sign of moon or stars. That night, when, after an unusually-tender parting betwixt Mrs. Lathrop and her nephew, the young man went to his own room, he paused a mo- ment as he reached the passage which led to the chamber in which the old secretary stood, and de- bated with himself irresolutely. "Not to-night," he said at last; "to-morrow will do as well." And he went to his room, and his sleep was broken, and full of troubled, feverish dreams that night. The next day was more stormy than its predeces- sor; for, though in the early morning there was a promise of sunshine, the clouds triumphed and cur-   31     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. tained the sky afresh, and the wind rose and added its fury to the rain; and this day Mrs. Lathrop did not find her nephew insensible to the weather, for he inveighed bitterly against the rain, and he read the papers awhile; and his state of mind seemed pendulous betwixt moodiness and boisterous glee. After dinner the storm lulled; and again Mrs. Lathrop's pale, sweet face watched at the window while her nephew rode down the avenue again; and this time there was real anxiety in her tones as she said, "Something has come over Leonard!"At supper it was no better. He seemed in some moody abstraction, and answered his aunt's questions in a careless way, which showed he hardly understood them. After tea he did not join her in the sitting-room, as was his custom, but went into the library, and walked up and down the room with a brooding, des- perate face. "There's no use in putting this thing off any longer," muttered to himself Leonard Talcott. "It's got to be done, and I 'd better face it, and- and have it over." And he went up stairs. The storm was broken. He drew aside the cur- tains, and saw among the white sheets of flying clouds the golden clusters of the stars, and as they looked down on him, with their pure, solemn, stead- fast faces, he could not bear it. No stars should be witness to the deed he was about to do. He drew the curtains, and then he turned and walked to the   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     35 secretary with a resolute step, and the Temptation came and walked close by his side. He drew out the will from the concealed drawer, and his breath came hard, and his face was white, and he went to the light with the paper crumpled up tight in his hands. "Now's your time," whispered the Temptation; "you 'll never breathe free till it's over with; and when it's once done this property, which neither the dead nor the living have any right to defraud you of, will be safe in your own hands'; the quicker you put the thing through the better." And then Leonard Talcott lifted the paper to the small jet of flame--it almost scorched the corner- and suddenly he drew it away. "Stop one moment before you do this deed, Leonard Talcott," whis- pered a voice in his soul; "think what you will be after it-a dishonored, disloyal man; the sin will be on your soul, and the crime on your life. No mat- ter if no mortal ever knows it, you will; you must carry the consciousness, eating and burning into your soul, that, honored as you may be of men, you are no better than a thief or a forger; for, put it as you will, it is sin and crime before God and man to destroy that will." It was a terrible crisis for Leonard Talcott-a crisis out of which a man never comes as he was before; he is either a great deal better or a great deal worse. For nearly two days the forces of good and evil had been battling in his soul, and now had   36     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. come the deadly strife--one or the other must con- quer! No wonder the heart of Leonard Talcott seemed to stand still, and great drops, wrung out of that strife-which was not of the body, but of the soul- stood still on his forehead. Then the Temptation clutched him again: "What is to become of you, man, if you hesitate now?" it whispered; "will you go out into the world a beg- gar? For it's come to that now. What 'll life be worth to you when your fortune's gone? Put an end to the one, and you might just as well to the other. The land is yours-the money's yours. Fool! why do you hesitate? This isn't robbery; it's really defrauding no man-only keeping what is your right. Do n't quibble any longer. Burn up that will, and get rid of the matter." He lifted his hand again, and the curl of flame almost caught the paper. Another moment, and the deed would have been done! "Wait one moment," said the old voice, which had been speaking through all the storm and tu- mult which -had been in his soul for the last two days. "You call yourself an honorable gentleman now. There is not a living man before whom you have reason to blush for an act of your life. And is this, this will, Leonard Talcott, your price--the price of your honor, the price of your soul? "Which is worth the more, your fortune or your honesty? And will it pay to go through your whole   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPII.     37 life living a lie, stealing that which is not yours- for, put it as you will, that; is the true word--or by one brave effort declaring before God and men that, let come what will, you have done right and justice to your own hurt?" The hand which held the crumpled will had sunk closer to his side. Suddenly Leonard Talcott looked up. The shadow had gone from his face, light and strength were there. "I will not do this sin," said Leonard Talcott; "get thee behind me, Satan!" And the listening angels rejoiced! And the Temptation passed forever from the side of Leon- ard Talcott, for he had triumphed! It might be an hour later that the young man entered the room where his aunt sat reading. "I have been expecting you a long time," she said, as he sat down by her side. "I suppose so; but, aunty, there has been some- thing on my mind for-the last two days." "I was sure of it, my dear boy, and that you would speak when the right time came;" and she smiled on him, but faintly, for there was something in her nephew's face that troubled the lady. "You shall know all about it, aunt Ellen. But, first, I 've a story-a short one--to tell you." "Go on, Leonard," said the lady. "It happened, not many years ago, that a young man, who was possessor of. a large fortune which he had inherited from his father, discovered, while searching among some old letters and documents, a o   38     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. concealed will, which gave his entire property to a distant relative-this property, which had belonged to the young man all his life, and to his father be- fore he was born. You hear me, aunt Ellen?" "Every word, dear," answered the lady; and, although her face was intent, her nephew saw that she did not suspect the truth. "Well, this-will, which the young man discovered accidentally, stripped him of every dollar of his great fortune, and sent him out into the world pen- niless. It was very hard." "Very hard, Leonard;" and the soft voice of the lady was full of sympathy. "And -no one in the world knew of the existence of this will, and never could unless the young man himself disclosed it; and by doing so he must, as you see, ruin himself. "Do you wonder that there went on a long, ter- rible struggle in his soul?" "I can not wonder," answered the lady. "And now, aunt Ellen-you are a good woman- answer me, as you would answer before God, What was it that young man's duty to do? Ought he to reveal this will when it would inevitably ruin him to do it?" Mrs. Lathrop looked up in amazement at this solemn adjuration; but there was something in her nephew's face which held all exclamation in check, although, of course, she was as far as ever from suspecting the real truth.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     39 And she answered her nephew as before God: "I think, Leonard, it was his duty to make known this will; that however hard it might be for him, still that will made the fortune no longer his; he had no right to keep it." "Aunt Ellen," dropping his head- so that she might not see his face, "I am that young man!" He felt her hand clutch at his shoulders. "Look up, look up, Leonard! What do you mean?" It was best the worst should come at once now. "It means, aunty, that I have found up stairs, in the old secretary, the last will of Jerome Talcott, which bequeathed his entire property to his nephew, William Talcott." An hour later the aunt and nephew were sitting close together-close and calm. She had come to know, to realize it all at last; to know what it meant for the present and the future; and Mrs. Lathrop was not a woman to flinch from any duty appointed her. Her nephew knew that, gentle and loving as she was, she would not shrink from any path which she felt to be the right, although it led to suffering and to death. So he looked at her, with sorrow and tenderness struggling together in his face. "I knew, aunt Ellen, it would come ter- ribly hard on you to go out from the old home, where we've passed so many happy years together; but I knew, too, that thought would not alter the counsel you would give to me in this matter. But my sorrow was not altogether for my own sake."   40     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. "My dear boy, don't think of me; I shall not for myself, only to feel that I have brought this on you; for the first coolness betwixt your father and uncle Jerome was occasioned by my marriage. Your uncle was bitterly opposed to it, because my hus- band and he entertained different political opinions, and that is the reason why he cut me off in his will. Lewis and my husband, as you know, were class- mates, and the warmest of friends, and that in- censed our uncle." "It was his fault. I shall not allow you to blame yourself. And now the struggle is over and the decision made, I feel better and stronger than be- fore." "My darling boy"-and her glance was fond through her tears-"I never loved and honored you as I do this night. O, I thank God that, what- ever comes to us, my boy has been true to himself, to right, and justice!" And it seemed to Leonard Talcott then, that those words were worth more than all his lost wealth. "And we shall still have each other, aunty, with the old love and cares." "Yes, let come what will, we will stand fast by each other to the end." And the lady's smile was sweet and brave through her tears.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPI.      41 CHAPTElR     II. HAVING once thoroughly settled with himself and his God his course of action, Leonard Talcott set resolutely about its execution. The day after he had disclosed to his aunt the contents of Jerome Talcott's last will, he wrote to his cousin, Lester Talcott, acquainting him with the fortune which had, in so sudden and singular a manner, fallen to him, inviting him to come at once and take possession of his new estate, and affirming his willingness to leave it without delay, This done, Leonard Talcott breathed freer. All the true manliness, all the fine heroic elements in his character, which Dr. Reynolds and Guy Kenyon had felt and loved, developed their moral forces at this time. They softened the sting of pain which the young man sometimes felt at the thought of leaving Cedarwild, the name with which his father had so fitly christened his home, in honor of the beautiful grove of cedars at the right of the house. Yet Leonard Talcott could wander through the old rooms, and amid the pleasant grounds, and look them serenely in the face, remembering that after all there was something dearer to him than they, even just- ice and righteousness. When a man has sacrificed all things for these he will not be left comfortless. The former heir of 4   42     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. Cedarwild walked amid all that he had lost with a prouder step and serener bearing than he had done when he held himself their rightful owner. Mrs. Lathrop turned away often to hide the tears which suddenly filled her eyes when she saw the new light in her idol's face, the new ring and fervor in his voice, for there had come a new strength and force to her, nephew's life, which none could fail to see and feel-the strength which comes of self-sacrifice, of triumphing over temptation. In a few days the reply of Lester Talcott was received. From the beginning Mrs. Lathrop had an intuition that her nephew would not be dealt honorably and generously with by the new proprie- tor of Cedarwild. She had not seen him for many years, for he had passed the prime of his manhood in India, where he'had been engaged in business, and he must be over fifty by this time. Mrs. Lathrop remembered him as a cold, reticent, somewhat supercilious man, who had impressed her unfavorably on the few times she had chanced to meet him; a man, it seemed to her, of a narrow, unsympathetic nature; and the little which she had heard of the gentleman, from those who knew him, had confirmed her intuitions respecting the real essence of this man, Lester Talcott. But Mrs. Lathrop was certainly not prepared for the cold, businesslike tone of her relative's answer. He was evidently ready to take possession of his   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.      43 new fortune without any scruples, and with perfect self-complacency; nay, he apparently regarded-him- self and his father as grievously wronged, because they had been kept out of it so long, although it was quite impossible to attach any blame to either his living or his dead relative for the late discovery of the true will. The new proprietor of the estate was certainly haunted with none of those scruples which most men would have experienced on this occasion. And most men, too, would have apprehended the sacrifice which had been made so promptly and so nobly, for no one could fail to see the struggle it must have cost; and by what specious sophistries a man of unblemished integrity might have reasoned himself into thinking that this property was, after all, his own; and that a will made in a fit of rage, and most probably in failing strength of mind and body, which rendered it doubtful whether the maker thereof was in full possession of his faculties, ought not to render the former will, which embodied the great promise and purpose of his life, "null and void." And, certainly, any man whose interests had been so entirely at the mercy of another as had Lester Talcott's at his cousin's, with nothing but the lat- ter's sense of right and justice in the way of his holding what no power in the world but his own testimony could have wrested from him-any man must, it will be presumed, feel under vast obliga-   "    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. tions to one who had resigned so much in his favor for conscience' sake. But it was evident that Lester Talcott was troub- led with no emotions of this kind. It is true that at the close of his cool and self-gratulatory letter he signified a willingness to serve his cousin in any way which the other would suggest, and even offered Mrs. Lathrop a residence at Cedarwild, or, if the lady preferred, to settle a comfortable annuity upon her for life. Leonard Talcott tossed down the letter in indig- nation and disgust at this proof of his cousin's mer- cenary nature. "I will never take a dollar from that miserable man's hands-I will never see you, aunt -Ellen." "My darling," said the lady, shaken out of her usual gentleness by the letter, which she regarded as simply an insult, although the writer did not intend it as such, "I will work with my own hands for my daily bread, before I will soil my fingers with a gift from Lester Talcott." "Dear aunty, you shall not soil your fingers with 'toil for your daily bread' either. I will take care of you." The lady shook her head, amid her tears, not all of sorrow: "Ah, Leonard, my poor boy, you 'll have enough to do to take care of yourself now!" "No, aunt Ellen, I've got a stout arm and a strong heart to shelter you; and though now I lament the confusions of my wasted youth, my lost   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.      45 opportunities, my squandered hours, when the time has come which calls for all the energy, force, and faculty I possess, to earn, as other men do, their bread by the toil of their brow, still, in this one thing I am determined, to earn it for you and for me.' She knew he would when she looked at his flash- ing eyes; at his resolute lips. ",Where shall we go, Leonard, my child?" "I do n't want to stay here any longer; the old associations crush me, the very air stifles me now it belongs to him. Let us go, aunty, together; the world is all before us where to choose." He said this, spite of himself, in a tone of min- gled bitterness and pathos which cut Mrs. Lathrop to the heart; and yet she sympathized with her nephew's desire to leave Cedarwild at the earliest practicable moment. So it was settled in that interview that the change in Leonard Talcott's fortunes should be made public at once, and that he should that very evening write to an eminent lawyer in the city-an old friend of his father's, and because of it a friend to his son- relating all which had transpired, and earnestly de- siring him to obtain a situation in some law office, where Leonard could combine the study of his pro- fession with some practice in it. A few days brought the reply. The friend of Leonard's father proved himself true to the name. His letter bore witness to his combined amazement,   "    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. pain, and sympathy over all which had transpired, and his enthusiastic admiration of Leonard's conduct. And the letter did not end here. The writer had sought to render Leonard just the practical service which he desired, and had procured him a situation in the office of a former partner of his, where he could obtain a salary of a thousand dollars a year. The duties would be somewhat arduous, the margin left for study not large, but the writer affirmed the situation presented a capital chance for a young lawyer to obtain a practical knowledge of his pro- fession, and one that had required the exertion of all the old Judge's influence to obtain for his friend. "A thousand dollars!" It seemed small enough to a man who only the month before had held un- disputed possession of half a million. 'Can we live on that, aunty?" asked Leonard Talcott, laying down the letter and smiling not very bravely just then. "O yes, my boy! Many clergymen, doctors, and lawyers manage to support large families on that sum; and you don't suspect what a capital econo- mist I can be. I learned that in my early married life, you see." "Well, it will at least teach us to make our wants as few as possible. I think I shall close up with this offer, aunt Ellen, till the way opens for a better." "We must go into -the country and rent some pretty cottage there. It will- be easy to find one   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     47 large enough for you and me, Leonard. I've got some diamonds that, as you know, I have never worn, and the sale of these will furnish the little house neatly and tastefully, and I can get along with a single servant well enough." Leonard Talcott looked up with a flash of his old mirth. He had been grave enough, but not op- pressed of late. "Must I split the wood and carry the water, aunt Ellen?" "Not so bad as that, my dear." And then they both went into plans about this little cottage, and their life there, which continu- ally suggested such ludicrous contrasts with the old habits and style of living, that both aunt and nephew could not refrain from laughter, and really began to take pleasure in talking about the future that to one of them, at least, had something of the charm of novelty and romance. Nobody, to have looked at them, would have suspected that these two had just lost all they had owned on earth, and were going out from their beautiful and luxurious home to do hard battle with the world, knowing not even where they should find a roof to shelter them. When the last will and testament of Jerome Tal- cott was made known, it took the whole world by surprise, and Leonard Talcott's conduct in the mat- ter was the subject of wonder, admiration, and ap- plause on all sides. Letters crowded in upon him from his numerous friends, full of condolence and   48     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. sympathy, and yet there were hardly any of the writers who comprehended either Leonard's feelings or the motives which had influenced him in the one great decision of his life. A very few there,were that read its full scope and meaning, and drew from it glorious auguries for the future of the former heir of Cedarwild. The last evening of their stay here the aunt and nephew took a final walk through the grounds. Neither of them spoke. What emotions and mem- ories crowded and surged tumultuous over the young- man's soul as he gazed on the trees among which he had sported away the brightest years of his boyhood, on the old roof beneath which he had been born, and where he had hoped to die, could not be fathomed by any human speech! That they were keen and bitter none can doubt; but one thought took away the fine quick of their anguish, and this was the right which he had held dearer than they. Never for one moment, during that walk which tried his soul so sorely, did Leonard Talcott regret the part he had acted-repent the sacrifice he had made; in the midst of all he rejoiced in it. The night was a beautiful one in the early Octo- ber. Cedarwild never looked fairer in its silver- flowing lake of moonlight. The large, stately, sub- stantial, but by no means pretentious mansion, standing in the distance like a vast gray tent, the white walks winding like a silver embossing through   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     49 the dark green plush of grass-- O, never had Cedar- wild seemed half so beautiful to the eyes of Leonard Talcott as it did now- now that he was about to leave it; now that the old life of ease, of indulgence, of luxurious idleness, of -elegance and pleasure was ending, and the new life of labor, and discipline, and sacrifice about commencing. They -went in together at last, the aunt and nephew, both silent still, and both expressing by that silence the deep harmony and sympathy there was betwixt these two. Mrs. Lathrop leaned' close on his arm, and he held in his the small, soft hand. "Come up stairs with me, aunt Ellen," whispered Leonard, as they entered the house. So they went up into the chamber in which stood the old secre- tary, and the young man drew out the faded yellow document which had so changed his whole life. Leonard had retained the -original, and forwarded a copy to his cousin, who was expected from South America in two or three days. He unfolded and looked at it. There it was, the large, clear, and somewhat formal hand of Jerome Talcott. What a fierce resentment must have burned in the old man's soul when he wrote those words which disinherited the nephew whom he had loved as a father does the joy and strength of his house, his first-born! The will was made only a few weeks previous to his death. Would -that stern, self-willed nature have repented, would the old tenderness have tri- 5   50     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. umphed over pride and resentment, if the man's life had not been suddenly cut short? - Two witnesses- had signed their names to this instrument-one of them was the lawyer, the other the physician of Leonard's ancestor. It was quite singular that three days before the death of his patient the physician had fallen from his horse in a fit, and never spoken afterward, and  the lawyer had been suddenly stricken with a fever, and followed his client in a week. Mrs. Lathrop had known both the gentlemen well, and as she looked on this instrument a change suddenly came over her sad, intent face, and she looked up with a start. "O, Leonard!" "What is it, aunty?" wondering at her sudden agitation. "It is singular-it has just come back to me now, and I have forgotten it for all these years; it explains every thing." The nephew could gather nothing from the lady's, inccherent talk, but in a moment her speech cleared itself. "I remember the night Lawyer Matthews died. Your father and mother happened to be at our house, and there came a sudden summons for the former to the bedside of the sick man who was dying, and who had something to reveal to Lewis Talcott--something, so the message ran, relating to his uncle. We were in great consternation. Your   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPIL.     51 father started off at once; but much time had been consumed in finding him, and when he reached the lawyer's house he was dead! His secret was buried with him; but this has 'brought it at last to light." "It must have been that. How strangely it all has come about, aunt Ellen!" "Yes, Leonard; but I have a feeling, a convic- tion, that there is some hidden meaning and pur- pose in all this thing which we shall live to see and rejoice in-something that is of God, not of man!" "I fancy Dr. Reynolds would say that his wish has come to pass; at any rate, I've lost the fortune that he called my curse, and the time has come for me to go out and battle with the world." He spoke with a grave smile, a little tinged with bitterness. And forgetting herself, as she always did, for his sake, Mrs. Lathrop led her nephew-on to talk of their future--of the pretty little cottage they had been able to rent for a couple of hundred dollars, less than twenty miles from New York, near which the cars passed a dozen times a day; so that Leonard would be able to pass his evenings at home. It was a great comfort to the lady and gentleman to know that the only other face under that roof would be a familiar one; for the cook, who had lived with Leonard's. parents before his birth, had insisted, for love's sake, upon accompanying her   52     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. master and mistress, and sharing their humble home and fate. So the hext day the three went out from Cedar- wild, amid the keen demonstrative grief of all the old domestics. The day following the new owner arrived. 'He was a widower and childless; his head bald on the top, and his hair on either side tufted with gray. His skin had the yellow, dried; parch- ment look which persons usually have who reside long in tropical countries; a pompous, methodical man, somewhat rigid and reserved. "Not at all like the young master," was the unanimous conclu- sion of the domestics. CHAPTER IV. A YEAR and a half have passed. It was an even- ing in the opening of March, and Mrs. Lathrop sat in the pleasant sitting-room of the small cottage, which was her home and Leonard's. It was a small room, but furnished with a sim- plicity and taste which would have gladdened an artist. A warm maroon tone pervaded every thing, the carpet, curtains, furniture. Mrs. Lathrop sat sewing by the small oval table. The gentle face was hardly altered.. The Spring winds strive, and wrestle, and harrow the sodden earth outside, from which the noon suns   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     53 have gathered with golden hands the white flannels of snow, and the lady sews with thoughts far away, and listens for the car-whistle through the tramp and the beat of the winds. "I wonder what kept Leonard over the last train!" murmurs the lady, turning down the edge of her cambric. "It is so seldom that he stays over." And then suddenly she catches the car-whistle, the long, shrill sound rising up and triumphing over the struggle of the wind, and clearing its way through it sharp and clear as a blade. The work drops from Mrs. Lathrop's fingers; she sits still and listens. Ten minutes, and the door opens and Leonard Talcott enters. To a superficial observer the young man is not much altered. A shade older his face may have grown, but when he speaks you feel some subtile change, for Leonard Talcott is not the same man that he was a year and a half ago. He never can be again. This year and a half has done much for him. It has strengthened, disciplined, compacted him. He has had, of course, much to learn; and of that kind of learning which comes only from conflict and experience, from facing and battling with the world, with temptation within and without. How could it be otherwise? This man, whose spiritual physiognomy I am trying to delineate for you, had much to struggle with. There were his   54     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. old habits of self-indulgence to overcome; his old luxurious, extravagant tastes to repress; prompt- ness, perseverance, patience-all these to learn. Ah, Leonard Talcott had put himself to a hard teacher, even to himself! He had had his blessings though. You might well, have envied his feelings the day Dr. Reynolds - made a journey from his academy for the purpose of shaking hands with his old pupil, of saying, with his eyes and lips, "God bless you, my boy! You 've - shown yourself a true hero, after all. I knew it ,was in you." "What has kept you, Leonard?" asks Mrs. La- throp, meeting her nephew half-way. He bends down and kisses her. "At your old tricks, aunty. You promised never to fret yourself about me if I was n't on hand with the train. What is a wonan's promise worth?" The voice is not that of a man who has been overcome; hearty, helpful, hopeful-with some new element of force and will in it, somewhat graver, as his face is, than it used to be. "Leonard, that is the severest thing you ever said of my sex." Mrs. Lathrop's reproof loses its point in her smile. "It came in just at that moment, and saved me from answering your question, aunt Ellen, which, somehow, I was not quite prepared to -do." Mrs. Lathrop saw, by his look, that her nephew's   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     55 answer would be of a grave nature, so she waited, saying, "Martha will be in despair over her broiled chicken. We will have that first." And they went out, arm-in-arm, into the little dining-room together, just as they used to in the great one at Cedarwild. After tea they sat down together before the bright grate-fire in the little sitting-room, and Leonard watched with thoughtful eyes the fire, which lay like a glowing embroidery on the black ground of coals. At last he spoke. "Aunt Ellen, it was a matter of great importance which kept me over the train, to-night-one in which you, as well as I, are deeply interested." "Yes, Leonard." "You remember my old classmate, Paul Irving, whom I have lost sight of so many years; and the Summer he passed at Cedarwild; and the fancy you each took to the other?" "I remember." "As brave, tender, generous a soul as ever -breathed, but somehow always baffled in his strug- gle with the world, Paul broke down in business and in health, and went to California, taking his fragile young wife and two children with him. The climate was not very kind to any of them. The young mother died in a year, and Paul's heart was broken. He kept up, for his children's sake, for another year. Then the fever took him, and the dying man was troubled with thoughts of his boy   56     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. and girl, and of leaving them friendless in that strange land. A friend-a humble but faithful one-watched with him to the last. And, standing by his dying bed, Paul Irving made this friend sol- emnly covenant with him to bring his children to the East, and give them to my care, entreating me for the old friendship- not to forsake his father- less boy and girl, but to take them as his last gift, and give them good shelter and tender love under the roof of Cedarwild; for it seems the poor fellow never learned the change which had overtaken us. There were last, tender, touching messages to you, too, aunt Ellen, which you will hear from the lips of this humble friend, who so faithfully fulfilled his trust, and brought the children with him from Cal- ifornia. They are stopping for a day or two with a relation of his." Mrs. Lathrop looked up through her tears. "You have not seen them?" she asked. "Not yet; it was too late to-night." There was a little silence. "Aunt Ellen, these children bequeathed to my care by their dying father-what shall be done with them?" "You must answer, my dear boy." "Not I alone.  They will be a terrible care and anxiety for you?" "But if it were not for me, Leonard-if any thought of me were quite out of the question?" "I should take them."   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     57 "Then take them now." He leaned forward and kissed her. Then her mother-heart woke up for her darling. "But, Leonard, what a burden you will take on your young manhood! You do not consider, you do not understand what an expense it will be for you, and we have little enough now for ourselves." "I have thought of all that, aunt Ellen; but I can not leave these children of Paul's to suffer and die, any more than I could if they were my own." And the face of Leonard Talcott was beautiful. "We will go together and see them to-morrow," said Mrs. Lathrop. So it was settled. CHAPTER    V. AT the window of the little red school-house she stood a moment, and looked out. The. sky had a quenched, hopeless, bewildered face, as though it was desolate for its lost sunshine; the earth looked up to it anguished, amazed-all grace and beauty blotted out of it. It had rained with a slow, dead steadiness for four nights and days. The grass, what was left of it, was matted into a dark yellow flannel; the naked branches were soaked and drip- ping; there was a damp chill in the air which crept into- the nerves with a sensation like pain,   58     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. and any eyes which searched the face of nature for promises, help, or consolation, found there only loss, pallor, despair. And she--of whom I now write, standing at the window of the little red school-house of Woodleaf, with her young, pale, oval face, in which now some hidden loss and hunger camed out, and wrote itself in every fine, soft lineament-found no olive-branch for her soul. The clouds and the rains had fallen into her life now; it seemed, as she gazed, that the day without typified the day within, and the tears rose-large, salt, quiet tears--and fell slowly down that rare, fine, sweet face watching at the window of the red school-house. The scholars were all gone. The bare, soiled walls, the barren floor, the long, defaced seats, made a cold, ghastly background for the young teacher; and in that hour her life seemed to her as lost, and colorless, and bewildered a thing as the day of which I write. She was somewhere among her early twenties. She was orphaned of father and mother, and had but one near relative in the world, and he was this only in name; for in all the true spirit and meaning of that word, Philip, the brother of Edith Frank- in, was as though he were not. Their father had been a clergyman, well-nigh worshiped in his large parish in a rambling old town among the mountains of New Hampshire.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     59 He had spent his life here. No enticing perspec- tives of higher position and greater emolument could induce the clergyman to leave the Church where he had been settled in his youth, and where he toiled till the years ripened his locks, as the days ripen the year into snows. He was an old man when they laid him under the willows by his wife, and his young daughter could just recall her mother, standing away off in the dawn of her memory. She was in the middle of her teens when her father left her with a dying charge to his son never to fail his sister in watch- ful care and tenderness-and Philip Franklin had solemnly covenanted with his dying father to do this thing, and meant to; but, alas! he was cursed with infirmity of purpose, with an easily-influenced and vacillating nature, with an indolent and self- ishy-indulgent temperament, and the right things which he meant to do these he never did. At times he was impulsively fond and generous; at others, irritable, exacting, selfish. This sister clung to him with self-abnegating devotion-for he was all that was left of her family-and though she had the finest instincts of right and justice, still it was natural that she should be slow to learn her brother's faults; and'so she long heaped his super- ficial and shallow nature with the richness and fra- grance of her own. Her father had during his lifetime saved a few thousand dollars. Edith was a natural student, and   60     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. this money enabled her to complete the thorough education of which her father had laid the founda- tions. Her brother squandered his own, and man- aged to get all his sister's property into his hands by the false representations he made to her. The young man had a fine person and fascinating social qualities. He fell. into -evil company, dissi- pated habits, and at last Edith's eyes were opened to the real character of her brother. But she clung to him; his occasional visitations of remorse, his promises of reform, made her pitiful and hopeful, although these were sure in the end to disappoint her. Her brother's inefficiency aroused all the latent courage, energy, and endurance of Edith's character. She had many friends in" the old New Hampshire town, both for her father's sake and her own, and  she succeeded in establishing a day-school, which promised to expand into a flourishing academy, for whatever this girl set her will to do that she would do well. Her brother failed in all his undertakings; and, at last, a strong desire took possession of him to come to the city. An opening as book-keeper soon pre- sented itself in a commercial establishment. Edith feared the temptations to which the mercurial na- ture of her brother would be exposed, and stronglyv combated his determination to go to the city. But it was in vain. Philip was resolved on this migra- tion, and implored his sister to accompany him, for   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.      61 his weaker nature felt the need of her strength and moral force to rest upon. So at last Edith yielded- to his entreaties,' re- linquished her school, and followed her brother to the city. She had no friends in the metropolis, but she was not of a nature to remain long idle, and when, through the influence of some acquaintances she made, at the house where she boarded with her brother for six months, the charge of the district school was offered her, she accepted it. It was a hard, lonely, toilsome life for the deli- cate, sensitive girl-wominan; but she heaped every auty and sacrifice with the fragrance and gracious- ness of her nature, and wherever her work fell Edith Franklin did it with her might, with that brave, cheerful, conscientious spirit which is "as unto God." For a while all went well with Philip. And in the midst of the hard, wearing toil with which each day burdened her, the heart of his sister turned with hope and joy to the future of her brother. But the old fears and not the new hopes were the true prophets. After a while the evening train did not bring Philip Franklin regularly from the city to the pleasant old farm-house where he and his sister boarded, and the slow watching, the long heart-ache, the wearing anxieties that have been through all ages the lot of womanhood, fell to the portion of Edith Franklin.   62     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. Her brother fell into temptation; went from bad to worse. Brief compunctions of conscience, weak efforts at reform, which had no deep roots of prin- ciple, were only followed by new failure and dis- grace. The clergyman's son became thoroughly dissipated, lost his place; his broken-hearted but still brave sister was often obliged to defray the expenses of his board, although he avoided her as much as possible after his fall. The silent reproach in that young, fair, pale face was more than even he could well bear. And that day, as Edith Frank- lin stood at the window and looked on the dreary, dumb earth, it seemed to her that her life stretched before her as blank, and desolate, and baffled as that day was--going down into the night; and the old cry of the Psalmist seethed up from her heart to her lips, as it has from so many human hearts, "How long, O Lord, how long!" But the night was beginning to fall, and her road lay over the hills, through that cold rain and those drenched and beaten fields, a mile off to her home. She locked the little school-house once more and went out. The wind came up with the night. Perhaps the weakness which  had come over the girl's spirit dominated the delicate frame for the time.   The young teacher could hardly make her way, and she could not hold her umbrella against the wind; it caught and whirled it contemptuously in the small. hands, whose force was not sufficient to control it.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.      63 And so, battling with the wind and rain, the small figure, in its brown garments, caught the eyes of a young man who was walking rapidly from the depot toward the main road in the town of Woodleaf. There was something singularly picturesque and pitiful in that one dainty, desolate figure against the dead landscape. A  graceful, womanly figure, too-a lady's, by grace of birth or gift of God. You knew that, as far as your eyes could see it--a figure that, somehow, to this one pair of eyes seemed to make some appeal for warmth, color, shelter. The young man made better headway against the wind than the solitary lady, and in a little while came up with her as she struggled through the storm. A blast, fiercer than ever, struck her umbrella, dashed her and it suddenly around, and Leonard Talcott and Edith Franklin stood, for the first time, face to face. That fair, sweet, wonderful face-not so mourn- ful but a true observer could see that it held in it all sweet possibilities of smiles and infinite revela-' tions of light and gladness-that fine, delicate, most womanly face struck and thrilled Leonard Talcott as the face of no woman had ever done. The wind had fairly scourged up some false roses to the pale cheeks; the sad mouth was flushed as, with a start that was partly nervousness and partly surprise, she turned it up to the young man.   "    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. Leonard Talcott acted almost involuntarily on his first impulse: "Madam," he said, "you will not be able to hold your umbrella against the wind; won't you take shelter under mine?" And as he spoke the wind answered for the young lady, closing her umbrella and driving her right under Leonard Talcott's with such force that she fairly fell against him. All strength of body and will seemed for the moment driven out of Edith. She said, with the faint, grieved look of a tired child, "I do n't see as I shall ever be able to get home." "Yes, you shall. If you will take my arm, I will see that you reach there safely," answered the frank, kindly voice of the stranger to Edith Franklin. She looked up into his face--a strong, manly, true face--a face for any woman to trust in any need-one that would deal by her reverehtly and tenderly, as a man would by his own mother. Edith Franklin took the arm of the stranger. The wind beat, and the rain fell in dead, slow, chilly sleets, but Edith had no more struggle with the elements. She did not speak till they came to a sudden turn in the road. "This is the way," said the lady; "I board at Deacon Ramsey's. It's only half a mile further on." By this time some warmth and courage had got back to the small, chilled figure.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.    - 65 "I am glad for your sake, ma'am. This is not the weather for a lady to be out." "No; but I must obey a higher law thanr that of the weather;" and a little, proud, sad smile ac- companied the words. Her companion bowed. Whatever curiosity he might feel respecting the higher law which con- trolled her he was quite too courteous to betray it. Edith felt this in a moment. "I mean that I am the district school-teacher," she added, simply. He looked at her again--a look which said he thought her out of place there, and that had, be- yond this, interest and sympathy. They had reached the old farm gate now. He held it open, and went in with her up to the great portico, under whose shelter neither the wind nor rain could reach her. Then she turned round and -held out her hand, and looked in his face with a little smile-a fine, sweet, frank smile. "You have been very kind, sir, to me," she said; "I hope some good angel will remember it of you, and put it some time into the heart of a stranger to serve you when you need it, as you have me." It was a pretty, original way of acknowledging her indebtedness, and the feeling which prompted it brought her face out of the chill and desolation in which he had seen it, ten minutes before, into life and warmth. "Thank you; I hope that good angels next time 6   "    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. will put it into some heart to render you better and higher service than I have done." And he went away. At the gate the wind struck his face again; but it had changed. "The rain is over, the sun will shine to-morrow," said Leonard Talcott. Before he reached the main road again, he met a couple of men, apparently in great haste, who in- quired eagerly the way to Deacon Ramsey's. He informed them, and they hurried on, while he felt a singular impulsion to stop them, and inquire what their errand was. But this, at the least, would be intrusive, and so Leonard Talcott, too, kept on-to the home where warmth, and love, and fragrance awaited him. Edith Franklin had   hardly removed her hat and cloak, when the deacon's wife called her in a voice full of some undiscovered alarm and fore- boding, She hurried down in some vague terror, and found two men there with a message for her, which the farmer's kindly wife tried to deliver with a face that her voice contradicted. Edith soon got at the truth of the matter through the strangers. A man had sprung off from the cars about six miles from Woodleaf, when they were going at full speed. The train was stopped, he was picked up insensible and conveyed to the nearest depot, a couple of miles off. A surgeon was pro- cured, who said that the stranger was injured   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     67 internally, and probably fatally. He had told the conductor that he wished to alight at Woodleaf, at the station nearest Deacon Ramsey's. And so the rough but kindly men had started off to acquaint the man's friends, if he had any, with the accident. The conductor thought he was somewhat intoxicated when he spoke to him. Edith Franklin did not faint, not even did she cry. She covered her face with her hands, and listened to all which the men said. They could see her shiver from head to foot, that was all. When she took her hands away, her face was white as faces frozen in death. "It is my brother," she said, "I must go to him." Three quarters of an hour later she had reached the little depot, in the back room of which her brother lay-dead! A dark, cruel bruise on the temple was all the change which was visible in his face. He lay there, the brown rings of hair curling about the dark, handsome face; and Edith looked down on her brother, and forgot, for a moment, his soiled and sinful manhood, his lost, bankrupt life, the death in which there was no hope. They were the children of one father and mother, and she wept for him as the living weep for the dead. All that night she watched at the little depot with her' dead brother, she and the kind-hearted deacon, who came late in the evening to ,take his place by the side of the lonely orphan.   68     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. It was after midnight before Edith could induce the old man to lie down on the lounge in the little saloon; but at last her entreaties prevailed, and in a little while nature succumbed, and the old farm- er's deep breathing showed that he had fallen into a heavy slumber.              , Then Edith stole back into the room where the body lay, uncovered the dead face, and looking on it there, her heart rose up in a fierce reproach against the dead, such as it had never uttered to the living. She thought of her blighted youth; of her weary, desolate life; of her lonely hours and broken hopes; of all the wrong, the long, cruel, irretrievable years of wrong-which she had suffered; of the love which had been turned back on her hungry, aching heart; of all the sense of loss and desolation which it seemed to her then she must carry to her grave. And all her keen, deep sense of right and justice rose up for a moment against the dead-the dead who now had no power to redeem the past for her. With that thought the heart of Edith Franklin softened; the memory of the long-gone, happy child- hood in the old New Hampshire home came back and pleaded with her for her brother; the thought of the soul that had gone out burdened and alone to its Maker; of the many prayers with which his life had been anointed-all these things came over and melted the bitterness in the heart of Edith Franklin, and with a cry she sank down on her   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     69 knees: "God forgive thee, freely as I do, Philip, my brother!" she cried. And then her tears flowed sweet and healing as the Summer rain. CHAPTER    VI. "UNCLE LEONARD, uncle Leonard, please to open the door!" It was a sweet, pleasing child's voice which asked this question. And some very little fingers fumbled about the knob in an impatient, imperative fashion. Leonard Talcott was walking up and down the little sitting-room, which for once on his return he had found deserted. There was some doubt and perplexity on his face, and he was so absorbed that the little, impatient voice called several times before it reached him. As soon as it did, however, the cloud cleared from his face, and he went to the door with a little, tender, playful smile about his lips. "I believe somebody just called me, or was I mis- taken?" "It was I, uncle Leonard. Please let me in," soft and pleading, said the childish voice. "But who is I? that's what I want to know first," winking to himself in a pleased way. "O, it's Edna." "Edna, is it? Certainly she may come in," ,open- ing the door; and the little fairy creature which   70     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. stood there sprang, with a leap and a shout, into his arms. Her brown curls, touched with gold, fell down on his shoulder, and her cheek, with the glow of a Summer peach in it, nestled softly against his own. "What were you doing here, uncle Leonard, all alone?" "Walking up and down the room, and thinking, my darling. I didn't know but you had all run off and left me." "O, n nono!" hastening to reassure him. "But Martha's brother had just come in a great ship, and she must go and see him, and so aunt Ellen had to get the supper, and Paul and I were helping her." "Great help, I fancy," muttered to himself Leon- ard Talcott; and he kissed the small, sweet face which with the last part of the speech had assumed an expression of much self-importance. "But I shall put a stop to this;" and he hurried out to that part of the cottage which was the faithful cook's especial domain. Mrs. Lathrop was just turning from the stove with a platter of tempting broiled chicken, while Paul followed her, carefully conveying a bowl of gravy. "Aunt Ellen, how could you!" was her nephew's first expostulation, as he took the dish from her hand, and looked into her face, flushed and heated from her unusual labor. She smiled brightly in- his face. "How could I get the dinner when Martha   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     71 was gone? Surely there was no great cruelty in that, Leonard, as your look and words imply. But I meant to have had it ready by the time you got in. For once I did n't hear the car-whistle." "Dear aunty, you have enough on your hands without adding the cook's labor too," placing the chicken in the center of the table. "But this was an unusual occasion. Sit down, Leonard, and see whether my chicken does n't sur- pass hers," said Mrs. Lathrop, removing her apron, while the children crowded around Leonard. Paul Irving was in absolute contrast to his sister, a dark, beautiful, jet-eyed and black-haired boy, just seven, and two years her senior. "There's something in your pocket, uncle Leon- ard," he said, with a bright conviction in his face, after making some tentative investigations about the entrance to that, to him, enchanted territory. Leonard looked down on him with a smile. "I shouldn't wonder if there was something there, very large, and bright, and round, and yellow as the sunbeams, and that a little while ago was glow- ing like great golden blossoms through the dark green of trees that stood under the hot suns of Havana." "O, I know, it's oranges, Edna!" said the boy, turning his dark, glowing face to his fair-haired sister. "Well, we'll have the dinner first, children; that will be sweeter than any Martha ever got for us."   72     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. It was a bright, pleasant meal at which the little family seated themselves. The happy voices of the children, the loving faces of the elder ones, the bright words, and the little jests, all added some new element of gladness to it. And yet Mrs. La- throp's keen gaze soon discerned that some serious- ness or anxiety occupied her nephew's thoughts; his face fell into gravity every few moments, and he had frequently to be aroused from this abstrac- tion. Before dinner was over Martha returned in a state of jubilant emotion. And after the family returned to the sitting-room, Paul and Edna ex- plored Leonard's pockets, and drew out, with shouts of triumph, half a dozen large oranges, and he made lilies of two of these, and then watched the boy and girl as they devoured them with the eager, keen relish of childhood. "My precious children! Aunt Ellen, I wonder if I had a boy and girl of my own, if I should love them better than I do these of poor Paul Irving." "Hardly, I think, my Leonard. How strangely life has turned out for us within the last three years!" "I know it. I was thinking it all over to-day, and asking my own heart whether I was not really as happy with the new work, and cares, and love as I was in the old time." "And what did your heart say, Leonard?" "And my heart answered, 'Yes.'"   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     73 Mrs. Lathrop did not speak for a little while. "Leonard, this day has brought you some doubt or trouble?" "There is no concealing any thing from you, dear aunty," looking up with a smile, while his hand strayed among the brown curls, touched with gold, of Edna Irving. The lady awaited his further reply. "Well, the truth is, I 've had a new offer of busi- ness. An English gentleman, settled here for three or four years, wants a tutor for his two boys, among their early teens. The situation will, in many 're- spects, be pleasant, and the salary will be fifteen hundred. We need the three more, aunt Ellen, sadly, our family has expended during the last year." "It would be most acceptable, of course; but, Leonard, I know you would prefer to stay in your profession." "Certainly; but I have learned to make ' I must,' not 'I will,' the governing verb of my life." "And does that mean that you will accept this new situation-?" "I think so. Let us talk it over calmly, aunt Ellen." "But you will make this sacrifice for my sake and the children's, my poor boy. I will not con- sent to it." Her nephew had to reason and plead with Mrs. Lathrop a whole hour before she was reluctantly   74-    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.  persuaded to do this; but she was, finally, seeing  that Leonard's mind was made up.           - Afterward he said to her, suddenly, "Aunt Ellen,  - you remember the young lady whom I accompanied V  to Deacon Ramsey's in the storm last week?"  xYes."                      -^ "I learned, on the train, this evening, that a  brother of hers-who, it appears, was her only  near living relative-sprang from the cars that  very night, in a state of intoxication, and was killed."  "O, how shocking!" "Shocking, indeed. He was interred here, two  days later; and his sister has returned home to her friends in New Hampshire. It seems their father  was a clergyman. I have not yet learned the lady's name." "Poor girl! What a blow it must have been; and I was intending to call on her this very week."  "Yes; I shall never forget her face. I have never seen one like it; I wonder if I ever shall an- other?" said Leonard Talcott to himself, in a half-  sad, half-troubled voice. But his aunt did not hear him, for just then the children called her. A little later Paul and Edna kneeled down before him, with their hands clasped, and their sweet faces bowed down, and said their evening prayers; and, listening reverently to those child-voices, the pale face of the young teacher vanished from the thoughts of Leonard Talcott.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     75 CHAPTER VII. Two years and a half more had passed. This day of which I am now to write was in the heart of June -a day of winds full of the musky fragrance of the ripening Summer-of sunshine spilling its   A; golden joy on every object, and heaping and over- flowing the earth out of its own brimming fountains of light and gladness. The afternoon wind from the sea came cool over the meadows, and stirred the roses which made a red fire of bloom about the small cottage veranda. And here, on a small lounge, and carefully propped up with pillows, lay the pale, sweet face of Edna Irving. Leonard Talcott sat on one side fanning her gently with a great palm-leaf, or stroking the little waxen cheek out of which all the bloom and roundness had fallen; and then the little girl would lift her blue eyes to her foster-father's, and smile sweetly and happily out of the content in her heart. And the pale, small lips would most likely motion for a kiss, which was sure to come, quick and tender as a mother's to her sick child; and then the small arms, the little white, thin arms, would lift themselves feebly, and tighten about the young man's neck, for Edna loved Leonard Talcott better than any thing on earth, better even than she did Paul or Mrs. Lathrop.   '7G    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. She had been ill with a fever in the late Spring- nigh unto death for several weeks-and nothing but the most tender and assiduous care had saved the life that flickered so low in the pulse of Edna Irving. But the fever spent itself at last, and the little girl began to convalesce; but when they looked for the pleasant Summer days to bring the lost roses to her cheek, and the fleetness to her step, they did not come, and Edna lay still, and white, and pale, almost as the dead, on her pillows; and they could hardly see that she gained strength or appetite as they watched the child day by day. "It seems good, uncle Leonard, to be out on the veranda once more," said the faint, sweet voice of the child, and her eyes sought the roses, burning thick, like live coals, among the dark leaves. "Does it, darling? It would seem better if Edna and I could have one of our old frolics up and down the veranda, and I could hear her quick breath and her glad laugh together, as she chased after me." The old light came into the child's eyes. She clapped her small hands, and half lifted her head, but it fell back again for weakness, and seeing it the heart of Leonard Talcott ached. There was another seat on the portico, and while this brief conversation transpired,- Mrs. Lathrop came out with a large ripe banana on a small china plate, and smiling on Edna, said, as she sat down,   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     " "Uncle Leonard's brought something she will like this time." The child looked at the tropical fruit a little wist- fully, and Leonard took out his fruit-knife, and pro- ceeded to strip the golden rind away, and then cut a creamy slice and offered it to the child. "Will you try and sit up, dear, and lean against me while you eat?" "Yes, uncle Leonard--what made you think of this?" "O, because I wanted to find something that my little bird would n't peck at, just as the canary does, but would eat right down with a grand relish, just as she used to the oranges I brought her." "I was well then, you know;" looking up with an apology in her face, as he lifted her tenderly and rested the shining head against his breast. "And would God you were that again!" thought Leonard Talcott. And Edna ate the slice of banana in the slow, languid fashion of an invalid whose ap- petite nothing can beguile. And when the uncle asked her if she would take another, she shook her head, and in a moment the blue eyes closed, and the child dropped asleep in the cool shade of the veranda. "Aunt Ellen, I do not like this," said Leonard, in a low voice. "Neither do I. It is strange the child does n't gain any strength;" looking with tender solicitude on the pale, drooping face.   78     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. "I ve had a private talk to-day with the doctor." "You have?" "Yes; I could n't let my little flower droop like this!" "What does he say, my boy?" "He says the child needs change of climate; that medicine will do her no good; that she needs the bracing air of the mountains." Mrs. Lathrop's face fell, a sigh smothered itself on her lips. She had no answer for the doctor's prescription. "Aunt Ellen," speaking like a man who has made up his mind, and Leonard's voice had grown to sound like this very often now, "you and Edna  must go to the mountains for a couple of months." Mrs. Lathrop looked at her nephew in a mixture of amazement and distress. '0, Leonard!" she said, "it can not be. We can not incur this great expense." "We must, dear aunty. Edna's recovery, her life perhaps, is at stake, and I have made up my mind to it." "But, Leonard, have some mercy upon yourself. Just think what this long sickness has cost you. How in the world can you ever meet it all?" "Somehow, aunt Ellen; I must take, for the sake of those I love, some new lessons in economy. For instance, my best suit of clothes must last me another year, with a little rejuvenation at the tailor's; just as you turn your old dresses and bon- ... o   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     79 nets, and made them look as good as new. Then I'll do a little extra copying, and so manage to foot the- bill. Of course, hotels, with their prices, are quite out of the question; but you can find some pleasant old farm-house among the mountains of New Hampshire, where Edna can get the free, bracing air which alone will bring back her lost appetite and strength." lirs. Lathrop leaned over to her nephew, and the tears ran swift over her fair, faded cheeks, as she said, "O, Leonard, I never felt the want of that lost property as I do at this hour!" And Leonard Talcott smiled a brave, manly, tender smile in his aunt's face. "Dear aunty, I don't go mourning for it, neither must you for my sake." "Yes; for yours, Leonard. Do n't I see, my boy, for whom I would gladly lay down my life, that you are toiling away the best years of youth 'in this endless drudgery of teaching-teaching to sup- port me and the children! I know that your heart and your ambition are with your profession, no matter with what patience and courage you keep on from day to day, and from year to year, for the sake of "those you love, at this other work. O, Leonard, it seems sometimes as if the knowledge of this would break my heart!" And Leonard Talcott leaned over and kissed the wet cheeks reverently and fondly, as a son would his mother's. "Aunt Ellen," he said, "it is God   80     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. who has appointed me this work, who will give me patience and strength to fulfill it faithfully, and who has taught me how sweet it is to work and to sacrifice ourselves for those whom we love." "But the beloved do not feel the work and the sacrifice the less keenly; and sometimes this thought which I carry, a great burden in lny heart by night and' by day, fairly overwhelms me. I remember Lester Talcott, and I wonder that some especial judgment of God does not overtake him for the wrong he has done -you, and it seems as though I must sit clown and write to this hard, miserly, cruel man all that is in my heart." The face of the young man flushed crimson. "Never, aunt Ellen, never condescend to do this thing. He would only regard the letter as an ap- peal to his charity; and, so long as God gives me health and strength, I will save you from that." At-hat moment the little front gate opened, and Paul Irving's dark, bright face bounded along the walk, full of keen surprise and joy at seeing the family assembled on the veranda. "Ah, Paul, you're home early this afternoon," said his uncle, holding out his hand. "'Yes; school closes half an hour earlier Wednes- days, you know. O, isn't it nice, uncle Leonard? I wish we could always live outdoors." - "Provided it was always June, you mean. But next January, when the winds blow, and the snow falls, and your n6se gets blue if you put it outside   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.,     81 the door-what then, my boy?" laughed Leonard Talcott. Paul looked as though this was a side of the question which he had not yet contemplated, and after watching the child's face with amused eyes for a few moments, Leonard changed the topic most agreeably to the boy by saying, "Come, see what you can do with the rest of this banana, only be quiet, so as not to awake Edna." But as Paul took the plate, and thrust the point of the blade into the heart of the banana, another thought seemed to strike him: "O, uncle Leonard, I forgot! when I was passing the office, the clerk called me and gave me this letter for you." Leonard took it with considerable surprise. He did not recognize the handwriting, and Mrs. La- throp watched him with a little curiosity as he broke the seal. She saw his face start into bewil- derment and wonder, at first, then the paper shook in his hands, and he grew white to his lips. The letter must have been brief, for in a moment he looked up with a strange, shocked look in his eyes, and his first words were those of a man who hardly knew what he was saying. "Aunt Ellen, this brings strange news for us!" "What is it-quick-is it bad, Leonard?" "Lester Talcott is dead!" "O Leonard!" and her face was white as his. "He rode out three mornings ago; his horse took sudden fright and threw him violently down a steep   82     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. precipice. He was taken up senseless, and terribly bruised, and survived only about twenty-four hours. He had, the letter says, full possession of his reason most of the time, and made his will, in which, the writer says, who was his lawyer, that I will hear somewhat to my advantage. The funeral transpires to-morrow, and in order to be at Cedarwild in time, I must take the next train for the South, which leaves in an hour." "O, Leonard, this man, Lester Talcott, was not prepared to meet his God!" exclaimed Mrs. Lathrop, all other thoughts absorbed in this greatest one, and she burst into tears. "Perhaps-we can not tell what those last hours, when he stood face to face with Death, did for our relative," said Leonard Talcott, solemnly, as he laid back the sleeping face of Edna on its pillow, and kissed it; and an hour later he was on his way to Cedarwild, with tumultuous thoughts crowding fast upon him, as he remembered how he had last left it, and under what changed circumstances he was now -returning. And then the thought that God was in all this calmed the heart of Leonard Talcott. He was the only mourner at the grand and deso- late funeral the next day; and with what feelings he looked upon the old rooms, and wandered over the old grounds, where nothing was changed, and which made the last four years seem like a dream that is gone when one awakeneth, Leonard Talcott could never tell,-even his aunt; but at last the old   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     83 memories crowded too thick and heavy, and the young man sat down in an old grape-arbor that used to be his favorite resort when a boy, and cried for an hour like a little child. After the funeral was over, a few of the friends and neighbors of the deceased assembled in the par- lor to listen to the reading of the will. Its tone showed that the last hours were the wisest and best of Lester Talcott's life. There were a few legacies and annuities left to old friends and servants of the deceased, but the rest of his property, including Cedarwild, was all left to his nephew, Leonard Talcott; and the will closed with a solemn adjuration to the living pro- prietor to use this wealth, lost and regained, better than the dead one had done. It was touching to see the old domestics as they crowded with sobbing joy and congratulations about their former master. But in the midst of all the excitement and gladness Leonard Talcott was calm and grave, glad most certainly from the depths of his soul, and grateful to God; but those four years had wrought a great work in the soul of Leonard Talcott, and the new owner of Cedarwild would never be what he had been. The next day he took the train for Woodleaf. He reached the cottage, which would be their home no longer, and which began to grow real once more, just as the sun had crossed the great hill in the West.   84     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. Mrs. Lathrop and the children were in the sitting- room when he entered it, and the golden curls of Edna were scattered over the lady's lap like sun- beams spilled and lost out of the June noon. Leonard was pale. He kissed the three with a tender gravity, and with a look in his face which made Mrs. Lathrop wait for the words. They came in a moment. "Aunt Ellen, Cedarwild is restored to me; the child can go to the mountains!" CHAPTER VIII. "THE work is growing too heavy for me here. I need some change." The speaker of these words looked out from her chamber window over a scene which travelers from afar came many miles over the rough country roads to behold. Right before her, only a few miles off, stood up the great, solemn mountains of New Hampshire in their eternal wor- ship. Between them and the speaker lay the wide meadows, and the green plush of their Summer grasses was changed now to the brown woolens of Autumn, for it was in the early September, and the frosts had touched them. And ,these mountains, standing alone in their grandeur, had never a more loving and reverent witness than this girl, looking out of her chamber' window, as she had once looked out of the little red   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     85 school-house at Woodleaf. Day by day for nearly two -years had her soul gone up to them for worship. They had joined with her in worship, and praise, and prayer, and they had been strength, promise, and healing to her. She loved the mountains. But the time had come for a change. The fine, sweet, brave spirit panted and drooped for it. The monotonous country life, with its arduous school duties, had grown desolate and burdensome; and yet, looking on all sides, Edith Franklin did not know where to go for counsel or help. She dwelt among her father's parishioners in the secluded old New Hampshire town; kind and honest people to the core-true friends to the daughter of the dead clergyman whom they held in such sacred and loving remembrance. But Edith needed what they could not give her, rest and refreshmemt; and yet, when she looked out into the dark and cold of the world she had braved three years before, a chill of dread and dismay struck through the -soul of Edith Franklin. But this hard, daily toil in the large academy was more than she was equal to, even in that fine bracing air. Every week the young teacher felt her strength breaking down, her nerv- ous organization more susceptible, and the doctor said, "You are killing yourself; you want change; you must give up teaching." She knew it better than he did; but whence was this change to come? For once the calm faces of the mountains could not answer her. If she should   86   -   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. obtain a situation in some city seminary, although there was small prospect of success here, the care and the labor would be the same, and Edith Frank- lin was poor--she could not afford absolute rest. If I could only obtain a situation as governess inI some quiet country family," she said to herself, with her fair, sweet face cut against the sky. "There are such opportunities for those more highly favored than I; but I have no father-no brother!"She paused here, and sighed. 'Ah, she was better off without her brother than with him! And in that pause, the eyes of Edith Franklin caught a couple of small figures hurrying down the road, which branched off from  the main one, nearly a mile distant. These small figures-a boy somewhere about his tenth year, and  a girl a little younger-paused almost under the chamber window where Edith Franklin looked toward the mountains. "I'm tired, Paul, and we've lost our way," said the girl, in a weary, despondent sort of fashion, as she looked up in the boy's face. "What will aunt Ellen and uncle Leonard say?" "O, come now, don't give up so, Edna! If I could only find the main road, the way would be straight enough. I'll stop at this farm-house and inquire." And he looked up at the pleasant old white house, and caught the face beaming out of the front window, and listening to his words.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.      87 "I will come down and show you the way," said the sweet, clear voice, which any child in loss, or need, or bewilderment, would have trusted. And taking her straw hat, for the evening was warm, the young teacher went down. The dark, bright beauty of the boy, the fair and singular loveliness of the girl, won strangely upon the heart of Edith Franklin. The road was an ir- regular one, leading through a little belt of forest and past the river before it intersected the turn- pike. "I will go with you," said Edith, putting her face down to the little girl's, and kissing it, "if you will like to keep me company so far." "Thank you," answered Edna, with a shy, sweet grace, which was a pars of her character. "We shall be very grateful to the lady, sha'n't we, Paul?" . And- Paul answered, "Very grateful, indeed, ma'am." And Edith took the little girl's hand, and Paul took the other, so they went toward the turnpike. The children were both prattlers, and Edith learned that the little girl had recently recovered from a long illness, and that her uncle and aunt had come to the mountains for the sake of the bracing air which had brought back the lost bloom to the cheeks of Edna Irving. "They had had capital times," Paul said; "he had been with his uncle, hunting, fishing, sailing,   88     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. and climbing the mountains, every day; for they had rented an old country farm-house, and had brought Betty and a man servant with them. And now Edna was quite restored to health, and they were going home again-not to the pretty little cottage at Woodleaf, but to a great, new, beautiful home, where there were great lawns, and arbors, and a little lake to sail on, and charming avenues, where uncle Leonard and aunt Ellen used to live a long time ago, and which somehow they had got back again. Paul didn't understand how, only uncle Leonard was a very rich man now, and would  never teach any' more." "Woodleaf! Woodleaf!" said the young teacher, catching up the child at that familiar name. "O, yes, ma'am, and--0, uncle Leonard!"-- The boy broke off abruptly, and his sister joined in the shout, as a gentleman on horseback advanced toward them. In a moment he was at their side, and had sprung from his horse. He lifted the little girl tenderly in his arms. "Where have you been, children? Aunt Ellen is well-nigh distracted about you!" he exclaimed. "We lost our way, and this lady was going with us to the turnpike." In his joy at recovering the lost children Leon- ard Talcott had hardly glanced at the lady. He turned now and lifted his hat to address and -thank her; but he started with the first glance that met   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     89 her face. And so did the young teacher, and into her cheeks, always too pale, the blood burned up quickly. "Surely, ma'am, I have seen you before to-day? I can not tell where." Edith Franklin smiled a pleased, tremulous smile. "Do you remember the storm through which you once assisted a stranger, solitary and helpless?" she said. His face cleared into glad recognition in a mo- ment. "I remember it," he said, giving the lady his hand. "But I did not suspect you would repay me here and now, and in such measure as you then hoped my good angel would some time." "I am tired, uncle Leonard, very tired," lisped the, soft voice of Edna Irving, and she leaned her golden head against her uncle. He lifted her and Paul on the horse, and then turned to the teacher. "Our home is only a half mile from here," he said; "if you will permit me to accompany you there, my aunt will thank you in better and warmer words than I can." The teacher smiled again--the sweet, winning, most womanly smile that made her fair face beau- tiful.- "I am satisfied with yours, sir. Good- night." She gave him her hand, and as Leonard Talcott clasped it, he silently covenanted with himself "that he would seek this lady's name, and see her face again before he left New Hampshire;" and 8   90     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. although he knew that Mrs. Lathrop was awaiting his return in almost frantic anxiety, he could not re- frain from turning back several times to watch the small, delicate figure, in its dress of purple lawn, as it moved down the road and lost itself in the belt of woods; and then Leonard Talcott sprang upon his horse, and spurred homeward with all his might, and a minute later Mrs. Lathrop rushed out of the gate to meet the trio on horseback. That evening, after the children were asleep, Leonard related to his aunt his singular meeting with Miss Franklin. "You remember, aunt Ellen, that the face of this girl or woman was to me, at least, like the face of no other woman I had ever seen." v "Yes,- Leonard, I wondered at the time that it should have made so singularly powerful an im- pression upon you! How strange that you should come upon it again, here, in this secluded place!" "Strange enough! Aunt Ellen, you will go with me to-morrow to thank this lady, as I said you would, for bringing back our lost children?" "I will go, Leonard, partly for this reason-and partly for another-perhaps a   less noble one. I am very curious to see her." It was late in the next afternoon when Leonard and his aunt presented themselves at the old farm- house, which had been Miss Franklin's home for more than two years. She came into the large, low, old-fashioned parlor, with a little natural embar-   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.      91 rassment, and yet with a bearing which any where you could not have mistaken--the bearing of an instinctive gentlewoman, which grand old word means somewhat more and better than that of lady, so meaningless and misapplied a term as the lat- ter is. Mrs. Lathrop was attracted toward the young school-teacher' at once. The fine, sweet, pale face touched her. It seemed to need some warmth -and color, just as this girl's life did, and yet it was a face that in any limitation or loneliness would con- front its duty steadily; would do it bravely, and would be light and graciousness in any lot of life. The talk of the ladies went on various topics which the Summer and the scenery about them was most likely -to suggest; and through it all, and quite unconsciously to herself, there shone something of the true quality of the soul of Edith Franklin. Leonard Talcott joined in the conversation some- times, but I think he loved best to listen and watch the face of the school-teacher, and learn it by heart. When, at last, Mrs. Lathrop rose to leave, she held Edith's hand, and said to her in her sweet, most winning manner, "If there is any way in which I can be of help or service to you, my dear, will you not allow me the pleasure and happiness of hearing you name it now?" Edith Franklin paused a moment.   Her face showed how keenly she appreciated Mrs. Lathrop's delicate kindness.   92     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.  "It is just possible that there may be one way in which you could do me a great service," she said. "Tell me, Miss Franklin." "I should like to obtain a situation as governess in some quiet family with two or three children. My health is- failing me here; my life needs change, but I can not afford rest without work, and I have no friends who can serve me in this matter. But it is possible you may hear of some opportunity, such as I have named, and then be so good as to re- member me." Mrs. Lathrop's eyes sought Leonard's. She read in them the thought that was in her own mind. "Miss Franklin," said the lady, "my nephew and I have decided within the last week, to place -our children under the care of a governess for this Winter. Our home at Cedarwild will, I think, be pleasant for you; the children are affectionate and teachable, and we are very quiet people." Mrs. Lathrop smiled here. "Do you mean-do you mean"-    asked Edith Franklin, and then something struggled into her throat. "I mean, do you think you would like to be with us this Winter?" The young school-teacher's face answered for her; in a moment her lips did. So before Leonard? and Mrs. Lathrop left, it was settled that Edith Frank- lin should Join them in a month at Cedarwild.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     93 CHAPTER IX. "THS is like the old times, Leonard," said Guy Kenyon, as he turned his horse's rein toward the broad avenue which led in a serpentine course up to the front steps of Cedarwild. Leonard Talcott spurred his horse up to his friend's side: "Yes, Guy, so much like them that I am often half-tempted to believe the past four years are only a trick of my imagination, and the old days and the new stand close together, without that long bridge which, after all, lies betwixt the 'then' and the 'now.'" "I can comprehend the feeling, and yet"- Guy Kenyon paused here suddenly, like a man who stops to consider and take counsel of his thoughts before he utters them in words. "Go on, Guy," said his friend, patting the arched neck of the beautiful animal which he rode. The young man turned his face full upon his host: "There is no change in Cedarwild, but there is in you, O my oldest friend and dearest!" The face of Leonard Talcott struggled a moment, then it settled into calm, and a bright, grave smile, which one who loved him would never forget. "You are right there, Guy; and if I am ever tempted to believe' the past four years are not, I remember   "    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. what I was then, I feel what I am now, and the years assert themselves; they live in me, and, thank God, they will never die!" "Then," said Guy, softly, "hard as the experi- ence was, it has wrought something for you?" "Something?- Every thing! You know what I was, to what my life was inevitably drifting; indo- lence, self-indulgence, want of all high aim and en- nobling purpose in life, a life that was seeking its happiness in merely aesthetic directions, was ruining me. And now I sometimes go up stairs to that old secretary, that once seemed to have cut down every hope and promise of my future, and made it as. barren and desolate a thing as that blasted old tree we saw the workmen cutting down this morning; and I make low reverence to the grim old piece of furniture, and -I say to it, 'You've kept your secret well, and you've been, under God, my best friend. You've made a man of me!'" "Bravo, old fellow!" answered   Guy, and  he reached over, took his friend's hand, and wrung it in a way which, with him, said more than his lips could ever have done. "Do you remember, Leonard, the talk we had together that last even-' ing I was at Cedarwild?" "Remember it, Guy?    How vividly it all used to come back to-me in the months that followed!" "And how little we either of us suspected that the crisis of the trial was so close at hand! There must have been an hour of terrible temptation for   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPI.      95 you when you first discovered the existence of that will!" "Terrible, Guy; and the temptation had almost got- the mastery of me. I thank God-I give the glory to him who delivered me in that hour from the evil!" And Leonard Talcott took off his hat and bent his head reverently, and so did his companion. Then the latter spoke, with a little smile that faded into seriousness in a moment: "I find the present owner of Cedarwild a little graver, a great deal wiser and better man than he was. Is he less a happy one?" Leonard's answer came quick and decided: "O, no. Is a man ever the less happy for having learned the joy there is in self-sacrifice, in working and de- nying one's self for others?" At that moment there was an opening in the trees a few rods from the door. The gentlemen reined up their horses, and looked at the lady who came out upon the veranda and stood still, leaning against one of the pillars, her face standing out, sweet and fair, from the dark green vines which, although it was October, the frost had not yet touched. She was dressed in a simple lawn, relieved only by some blue ribbon, which fastened a dainty ruf- fling at her neck. What a picture she made, of something most sweet, and delicate, and womanly, the lady could   96     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. in no wise suspect as she stood there, with her large azure eyes, beholding the beauty of the day. A wonderful day it was, too; its golden ripeness set in the heart of October. The winds seemed    . to hold the musk of the distant forest; the soft,   . tender sunshine spilled its glowing tides every-   ! where; the earth smiled back serene and reconciled to the brooding, peaceful sky; and this girl, stand- ' ing on the veranda, smiled too, not so much with   .:; her lips as with the happiness in her whole face, the fair, delicate, womanly face of Edith Franklin. Guy turned to his friend: "The lady is your children's governess, I believe."  "Yes; what do you think of her there and now?" "It is a fine, rare face- not handsome; I think few men would call it beautiful; and yet there is some singular charm and attraction about it. I think it is a face that will wear well, that will bear study. Where did you find her?" "Among the mountains- of New Hampshire. She has been with us but a week, and is, I think, shy about meeting strangers--the natural result of a life so introverted and secluded as hers has been. That is the reason that you've met her only once since you reached here yesterday noon." "There is no subtile resemblance betwixt the physiognomy of their native mountains and that face and figure. There's no ruggedness about the latter," said the guest of Leonard Taj cott, with his eyes on the lady.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. "Not the least; and there's no want of bright-. ness and health there, I think." At that moment Paul and Edna Irving burst, with their young, joyous voices and their merry laughter, out on the veranda. It was quite evident that the young governess had managed to secure the confidence and affection of her young charges during the week that they had been under her care. They rushed toward her, and asked, in their bright, confident way, "0, what are you doing, Miss Edith?" She bent toward them, the gladness of her face concentrating now in a warm, bright smile on her lips: "Pretty children, I am beholding the beauty of this day!" "Every thing is beautiful here, I think," said Paul. "Don't you, Miss Edith?" "I think so." "The most beautiful in the world!" slipped in the soft voice of Edna. "It seems so to me, dear child!" said the gov- erness, speaking mostly to herself as she caressed the child's golden curls. "And we are always to live in this beautiful place--here at Cedarwild; uncle Leonard says so," said Paul, in his prompt, asseverating fashion. "And you will live here, too; won't you, Miss Edith?" subjoined Edna, slipping her little dimpled hand into her teacher's. 9j  98     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. "I do n't know how that will be, dear," said Miss Franklin, a little seriously; "I hope I shall stay till you and Paul here have grown too large to need me any more." "That will be a long, long time," answered Paul, decidedly. "O, Miss Edith, I want you to come and see the three deer in the back lawn, and the white stag; Edna and I have been feeding them, and they are just as tame, and rubbed their noses into our hands, and looked at us with their great, beautiful eyes." "I'm afraid there will hardly be time before dinner," answered Miss Franklin, a little irreso- lutely. "O, yes there will! Uncle Leonard and his friend haven't returned yet--do come;" and, half against her will, the children persuaded their young gov- erness away. "Leonard, old fellow, there's one thing more you need to complete Cedarwild," said Guy Kenyon, as the gentlemen reined up their horses before the front door.  "What is it, Guy?"-springing from his horse. "You will want a wife, Leonard, one of these days, to share with you this beautiful home-to ennoble and enlarge you with her tender\ sympa- thies, with her keen, pure, most womanly mind, with her warm, loving heart. You can not con- ceive, O my friend, what new blessing and happi- ness such a woman will be to you-what her sweet   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.      9t influence will be about your life! If I speak warmly here, it is because I have such a wife now, and re- member the time that I had not." Leonard smiled, half gravely, half merrily; "I have all the other good gifts," he said; "I trust God will send me this in his own good time." "And for the present, happiness and peace to the future mistress of Cedarwild!" laughed Guy Kenyon, as he too sprang from his horse and hur- ried away to his room. Leonard Talcott hurried. to his also, but the words of his guest abode in his heart, and with them abode also the face of the young governess, as he had seen it standing still, shaded by the vines under the veranda. CHAPTER X. "THE wild, white bees of Winter!" said to her- self Edith Franklin, as she stood by the window in the library at Cedarwild, one day in the early De- cember, and looked out on the first fall of the snow, and saw the great swift flakes drifting down and building over the earth its white sepulcher. Miss Franklin had come thither for a volume, and thither also, quite unconscious of its occupant, came Leonard Talcott, in search of another. He caught the lady's words, as he opened the   100    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. softly-sliding door. "Are you fond of the snow?" he asked, close at her side. This was the first in- timation she had of his presence; and she started back, but was too well-bred not to regain her com- posure in a moment. "Yes," she said; "there was a time when snow had no beauty, only blankness and chill for me; but I have come to find grace and meaning in it now, as I begin to think we may in all God's works, if we look at -them with the -right eyes--I mean with eyes out of which a reverent, loving heart looks." And looking in her eyes, Leonard thought there was all this there just then, and somewhat more. "Miss Franklin," he said, half to himself and half to his hearer, "how differently all things look to us in this life, and how much fairer, when we bring to them the right kind of eyes--I mean the eyes of little children, seeing every-where the works of our Father who is in heaven!" She looked up now with a smile, almost radiant in its sweetness, and yet touched with a certain seriousness: "Yes; and yet how long it takes to learn the real meaning and spirit of that loving command, 'As little children.' " He went on: "'As little children,' in simplicity and single-heartedness, in all truth and guilelessness. What a terrible contrast to the conventionalities, the affectations, the hollowness, the false-hearted- ness -of the world, of our actual lives, with their   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     101 petty aims and ambitions, where we are all striving to seem what we are not, while the great work of life is to be and to do what we ought!" "OO dear!" sighed the lady softly, and partly to herself, "how very hard that is!" ( "You find it so?" asked Leonard Talcott. "Find it so?" and she looked up at him, her sweet face full of sorrow and self-reproach-" when my life is a constant struggle with my own weak- ness, my own selfishness; when I am baffled and defeated on all sides, and so often sit down despond- ent and disheartened, amazed at myself, at my utter unworthiness!" "It is the history of the growth of all souls. You know what Carlyle says of David: 'Having fallen, he was not content to lie there.'" "Yes," she said, softly; "and a greater than Carlyle has said, 'Faithful is He that calleth you; Who also will do it.'" He smiled now--a smile that broke up into light the gravity of his face, and yet retained its solem- nity. "The strength and the courage sufficient lie there. What would life be worth without it?" "Not worth living," she said, half sadly, half cheerily; such talk always having two sides.- He looked at her. Never before in all his wide knowledge of women had he found one with whom he could talk in this wise! In the very quick and essence of their lives there was somewhat which answered to the other.   102    TEMPTATION AND, TRIUMPH. "Miss Franklin," said Leonard Talcott, low and reverent now, "there is one great, supreme, central purpose for which we are living; after which, through all defeat, and loss, and weakness, we are    yet struggling -struggling to be Christians. Let  us shake hands together." She looked up in some surprise; but she was of the quality of woman to take such a request calmly, to comprehend its spirit; and she laid her hand, the thin, soft, flexible hand in his, her face dropping downward while she spoke. And as he took it, and clasped the hand so soft and warm, a new thrill of exceeding tenderness shot down, down into the very heart of Leonard Talcott,    ;' a yearning and longing to crush up that small hand in his grasp and cover it with kisses; but as he looked at that fair, drooping profile some other feel- ing of doubt or reverence held him back. Just at that moment the sound of small, swift feet hurried along the hall,' and in the next breath Paul and Edna broke into the library. The children started with surprise to see their uncle and Miss Franklin sitting together. They were quite too young and transparent for any dis-      guises of word or look.   "My little children," exclaimed Leonard, a little    archly, "you look surprised. What is the matter?" "Nothing," said Edna, recovering herself, and    rushing toward her uncle; "only I did n't know as Miss Edith was here."'     TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPI.     103 "But she came for one- book and I for another; and so we met here." "And so you stayed and talked, didn't you?" persisted Edna. "Yes, dear;" and Leonard laughed, and so did Edith Franklin, in a way which showed she enjoyed the whole, although the blushes were wide in her cheeks all the while. "What did you talk about, uncle?" inquired Paul, in his sturdy, practical way. "O, about some very good and wise things which you would hardly understand. Now it is my turn to catechise: what brought you romping in here after this fashion?" This question at once absorbed all minor subjects. "We came to ask you," said both of the children, speaking at once, " if we could n't have a sleigh-ride before night? Aunt Ellen says the snow is deep enough." Leonard walked to the window and looked out, humming a tune to himself. The snow was hardly three inches deep; but it had fallen on ground ready for it, and lay in a smooth sheet, without fold or plait, over the level earth. Overhead there was a rent in the clouds. "Yes; I think there is snow enough to warrant John's getting out the sleigh. Ladies, shall I pack you away in it?" for now Mrs. Lathrop had come into the library. "We shall have a great deal more fun if you and  104    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. Miss Edith go," said Edna, looking at her aunt beseechingly. "Well, then, Miss Edith, shall we help the fun?" smiled Mrs. Lathrop. "I'm ready to do my part," answered Edith, old home memories awakening in her at the prospect of a sleigh-ride. "Well, get your things on within twenty min- utes," said Leonard; and he went off toward the stables. And Edith Franklin hurried away to her own room, and sat down there and looked on the hand which Leonard had taken a few moments before; the small, slender hand, with an old-fashioned gold ring-her mother's wedding   one--on the third finger. Some confused feeling in her heart, partly of pain, partly of pleasure, came and went in her face, but did not make itself intelligible there. At last she rose up with a  deep-drawn sigh. "My work is set plain before me; I must put my heart and my soul in that service," she said to herself, getting up. Were these words an unconscious admission that there was danger of putting her heart and soul somewhere else? And thus there was, at times, a little constraint or contradiction in the conduct of Edith Franklin. The simple, natural character was not changed; the sweet, bright, impulsive nature disclosed itself every day in a thousand ways; but still, in the presence   TEMPTATION- AND TRIUMPH.     105 of Leonard Talcott especially, and frequently when with Mrs. Lathrop, there was in the conduct and speech of the young governess some slight con- straint, or shyness, as though she had imposed some law on herself. But her face was cheerful, serene, happy. She did her work as she had commanded herself, faithfully. The children were devoted to her, and Mrs. Lathrop could hardly have evinced more tender solicitude for the happiness of her own laughter. Leonard Talcott and the young governess were, Df course, thrown much together in their daily in- tercourse; still, they never came quite so close ,ogether in any talk as they had that day in the ibrary. Perhaps' Leonard felt the slight constraint n Edith's manner, and it may have affected his; lot its kindness and courtesy toward her, most cer- ainly, but its freedom. Then, through the Winter there was much com- )any at Cedarwild. Old friends of Leonard's and "s father's-men and women, young and old- locked to Cedarwild, to see its heir, and congratu- ate him on his restored fortune; and Leonard Tal- ott was the same generous, hospitable host as of ld; and yet, all his guests felt and knew that the ian somehow was changed.   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.  CHAPTER        XI. THE Spring had come at last. Many days had she been watched for by eyes grown weary of the Winter. But at last she had come and triumphed. There was the sweet smell of sprouting grasses in the air, the sweet singing of birds abroad in the earth; and one afternoon in the mid-May Paul and Edna rambled off on the hill-side, and brought home what they had heard their governess say the day before her eyes and her heart were athirst for-a little cluster of wild violets. They brought them to her in a small Sevres china vase, as she sat alone, reading in the sun- shine, which spilled itself through the bay window of the alcove that opened out of the sitting-room. A long, low, greedy cry broke from her as her eyes fell on the flowers. She bent over them and inhaled their sweet, spicy breath, with old memories of home, and of her far-off childhood, leaping out of a thousand silent corners of her heart. "0 my darlings, my darlings!" she said; "you are not changed any more than the mountains are where I used to gather you-the mountains of home." At that moment Mrs. Lathrop was heard sum- moning the children to her room on some errand,   ???S  ~TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.                107 and they went somewhat unwillingly, while Leon- ard Talcott, who, unobserved, had stood at the open window, vaulted into it. Edith looked up; the tears stood in her-eyes- they were in her voice too, a moment before, when she spoke that word home! :i 'The voice, the eyes stirred the soul of Leonard Talcott as it had been stirred that day in the library, as very often, all unconsciously to Edith Franklin, it had been stirred many times during those Winter days by her sweet and gracious pres- ence, which had diffused its fine fragrance about his life, and made him a gladder, stronger man, as a true woman does the man who loves her. Leonard Talcott laid his hand on the shoulder of the young governess. "Miss Edith," he said, "have you found so little a home with us that those tears are in your eyes for your lost one?" "No, it is not that, Mr. Talcott," said she, with the tears thickening in her eyes, "but the sight and smell of these violets have somehow brought back my lost childhood to me; and the dear, old Spring days when I used to go searching for them on the sunny slopes of the hills to carry home to my father-my father who loved them only less than he loved me." 'Her voice choked here. For months there had been some new pain and hunger in her heart for human affection; and silently, as a woman must,   108    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. and prayerfully, as a woman should, had Edith Franklin striven to live and to work down this pain; but now it was in her voice, in her face. Leonard Talcott's hand still lay on her shoulder; and over it his heart throbbed with a strength and tenderness that he felt now must force out in a mo- ment some words to his lips; he did not know what ones; but they would be of a nature that, once spoken, could never be recalled. When the words came, hurried up from his heart to his lips, and low and tremulous because of the feeling which freighted every syllable, they were, "Edith, you have said those words of the dead; they are true of the living." She looked up, only dimly guessing at his mean- ing even with his voice and eyes to aid the speech. She was not a vain woman, not given to building air-castles, and had, in some sense, outgrown the romance of her girlhood; else the attentions and the manner of Leonard Talcott might have awak- ened suspicions which had never dwelt in her thoughts. "What do you mean, Mr. Talcott?" she faltered. "I mean, Edith, that of one living, as of one dead, it may be said, 'He loves the violets only less than he loves you!"' There was no mistaking his meaning now. She was above any arts or affectations; but the surprise was so sudden, so great, that she could not have told whether it gave her pleasure or pain. She   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH,.    109 knew that this man, Leonard Talcott, would not say more than he meant. She had no thought of doubting him, but it came to her like a great shock. She buried her face in her hands till the great wave of emotion should go over her. Then she looked up-up iri his face, like a child half-bewildered; and her words were much like a child's too. "It can not be; I can not have heard aright; you so great, so good, so far above me--you who would do honor to the fairest and noblest woman in the land by your choice! And what am I?" He bent down to her and whispered, "The one woman in all the world whom my soul loveth!" He felt her shake in every limb again. Her head drooped. "I am so unworthy, so little fitted for all this. What will the world think? what will the world say?" "Edith, that is the only foolish speech I ever heard from your lips," said Leonard Talcott. This time, when she looked up, scarlet blushes had superseded the pallor in her cheeks: "For what do you love me?"The question, in its sim- plicity, was like her. "Because," he said, solemn and reverently, "my heart finds in you what it needs; because you live for the same purpose and with the same hope that I do, and because you, Edith Franklin, will, by your gentleness and sweetness, by your faith and service, by your daily living, reveal to me more   "O    TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH. and more of the beauty and glory of that religion I have come to love. For this, and for many other reasons, do I want you. My manhood will grow stronger and better for your womanhood taken into my life. O Edith, is there no answer in your heart? Can we not strive together to grow fitter for heaven? Can you not love me?" She looked up with her smile shining through its tears like lights through the rain. "I believe I have been trying not to for a long while," answered Edith .Franklin. And so Leonard Talcott had his answer. A little afterward he said to her, "Come with me, Edith;'" and he drew her arm in his and held it there tightly, and led her out into the hall. She supposed he was about to take her to Mrs. Lathrop, and her loud-beating heart made her almost faint as she heard the soft voice of the lady and the laughter of the children in one of the parlors. But Leonard Talcott led her past the door, and up the stairs into a chamber which she had never entered, in one corner of which stood the old sec- retary, huge and grim as ever. And standing there, Leonard Talcott told her, his newly-betrothed wife, all which had transpired in that very room a few years ago. Somewhat of this Edith had heard, somewhat had suspected; but now, listening to the story from the lips of him who had been so sorely tempted, she seemed to live the whole over again. Sobs shook   TEMPTATION AND TRIUMPH.     1" her from head to feet; but when he stopped, with the victory which succeeded the long struggle, she drew one long sigh. "Thank God!" she said fer- vently. "Yes, Edith, I do so daily for the temptation he sent me in that old secretary, and the triumph he gave me there. Had it not been for this, I should never have been the man, never the Christian, which I humbly hope I am now." And in a moment she drew a little closer toward him, and looked up with her rare, sweet smile full  of new tenderness: "And you would otherwise never have come to Woodleaf, and never have found me?" "No. I owe the old secretary this new, last, best gift of all," kissing the tremulous lips. "Come, Edith, I want to introduce to my aunt her new niece, to the children their new aunt. How delighted they all will be!" And they went out from the chamber together, and the blessing went with them. ,.   -i. r . r   THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE. "HAVE you been over the house, Miss Mar- garet?" inquired Mrs. Stebbins, a little, pleasant- faced, vivacious woman, as she stopped a moment in the sitting-room to adjust her shawl and receive the blue china bowl which she had brought over filled with jelly for Mrs. Phillips, who was an invalid. The mound of jelly stood on the table, on a small cut-glass dish of an antique pattern, and as the sunlight poured its golden rain upon the "quaking tumulus," it looked like an immense ruby. "No, Mrs. Stebbins; I have n't seen the house at all." The tones were sweet and distinct that answered. tHearing them you would not need to see Margaret Phillips to know that she was a lady, so far as cultivation of mind and graciousness of manner make one this. "O, you do n't know what you 've missed!" added Mrs. Stebbins, in her good-natured, sympathetic way. "It's a perfect palace. John says it' built after the style of some foreign nobleman's. There's no end to the money that it cost. I can't attempt 10        113   "4  THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE, to describe it; but there's the library openin' on the lawn, all of oak; and the parlors, with, the green and gold; and the dinin'-room-well, there's no tellin'. But I told John, after I got home, that my house did n't look bigger nor better 'n a shanty. But it's some folks' luck to be born with silver spoons in their mouths." "And some have the faculty of keeping the silver spoons--and some don't seem to." This general statement had a particular application in Margaret's mind, and this was the reason that there was a lit- tle touch of bitterness or pain in her voice, which, however, only a very keen observer would have detected. "That's a fact." Mrs. Stebbins was of the ac- quiescent, approbative type. "But"-slipping at once from general theories to specific facts-"it 's too late now to see the inside of the house, for the family are expected next week, and they've got a train of servants puttin' things to rights." "If it were otherwise, I have n't the time to get over there," answered Margaret, with a lack of en- thusiasm which even Mrs. Stebbins must have per- ceived. "You are -very kind, Mrs. Stebbins, to remember mother so often. I wish you knew how she will. enjoy -your jelly!" "La! don't speak of that. I thought it might set well with an egg, or some chicken broth. My grandmother Parsons used to say, and she was a reg'lar: hand at nussin', that there was every thing   TIIE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.  115 in knowin' how to coax along a weak stomach; it did more than the doctor a good many times." "I have no doubt of it, Mrs. Stebbins; and I really believe the nice little dainties you've sent mother for the last month have done more for her than all her medicine has." The little woman's faded face flushed with genuine pleasure. "I don't feel as though I'd done any thing at all, Miss Margaret; only jest to show that I'd got the .will." "I do-so much, Mrs. Stebbins, that I'm em- boldened now to ask you to do something for me. Isn't your husband on the school committee this year?" "Yes. .He tried to get out of it, but they would put him in." "If he has no other teacher engaged, I shall be very glad to obtain the situation this. year." "Miss Margaret!"Mrs. Stebbins had arisen from her chair, but she sat down again, and there was no need she should express her astonishment at the young lady's proposition; her tones had done this more effectually than any words could. "You are surprised?" said Margaret Phillips, looking her neighbor in the face with a brave smile, and one that had yet a little flickering pain in it. "Well, yes; I am quite taken aback," faltered the small, dark woman. "Of course, Mrs. Stebbins, this step is not, under existing circumstances, a matter of choice, but one   "6  THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE. of necessity. We are poor people now, mamma and, I, whatever we were once; and I must look the matter boldly in the face, as I have done many other things, and it will be a great relief to my present necessity if I can obtain the situation of which I have spoken." "I'll speak to John this very day," answered Mrs. Stebbins. "But how in the world can you take so much on yourself, with the care of your sick mother?" "Mrs. Stebbins," answered' Margaret Phillips, with a solemn faith on her fair young face, "God has given me strength to bear many burdens that I did not once think I could carry. I do not believe he will fail me in this one." Mrs. Stebbins made no further protest. That look of Margaret's silenced her; still, the manner in which she took the girl's hand, and pressed it as they parted, showed that she was both appreciative and sympathetic. Margaret Phillips went up stairs to her own room, and sat down by the window, and somehow -her gaze turned to the eastward, where, about three-quarters of a mile off, a couple of gray stone turrets showed picturesquely through the thick foliage. Somehow the sight did not seem to attract Margaret Phillips. The shadow of pain which had hovered over her face seemed to settle deeper there. Yet it was a morning in the late May, fall of praise and beauty. The white, fleecy mists hung wide on   TIE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.   117 the distant mountains, the air was perfumed with all sweet smells of young grass and blossoming fruit- trees, the birds brimmed the morning with songs, and through the branches filtered like golden wine the sunshine of the Spring. Every thing was glad, every thing but Margaret Phillips. Yet I would not have you suppose for one moment that she was a morbid or sentimental character, that she could not arise out of her own private limitations and losses and be courageous and of "'good cheer," knowing that whatsoever burdens and sorrows were appointed her here, she still had the one love to give thanks for, to rejoice in, and that, sooner or later, if she trusted it, all sorrow and pain should be lost in the rest and the joy which God promises to those who love him. And this Margaret Phil- lips believed, not-in occasional bursts of enthusiasm or exalted sentiment, but in her daily living, in struggle and -weakness, amid diligent work and petty cares, and sometimes amid bitter struggles. A very few\ words will give you a few necessary glimpses into her past life. Her father had been a rich man, honorable to the core in his dealings with all men, and respected and beloved wherever he was known. But, during the latter part of his life, he had been induced, through the influence of his partner, to embark in some foreign speculations which had proved totally ruinous through the weakness. and dishonesty of various parties. A fever, the conse-   "8  THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE. quence of exposure and anxiety, closed his life before he reached his fiftieth year. Margaret was the only and dearly-beloved child of her parents. Her youth had been sheltered by watchful tenderness from every sorrow. Her mother, a woman of a gentle, sensitive nature, had been an invalid for years; and the young girl found herself suddenly face to face with a world of which she had known nothing ex- cept the bright side. Then the soul of Margaret Phillips awoke within- her. She set herself diligently and bravely to meet these altered circumstances as soon as the first shock of grief for her father's death was over. The old, luxurious home was given up, the furniture sold, and, through the' influence of friends, Margaret en- tered a small, pleasant cottage in Woburn; for both mother and daughter shrank from the thought of life in the, city, where the old, harrowing associa- tions would be constantly revived. And for the next two years Margaret devoted herself to her mother's comfort, and the supervision of their small household; for they kept but one domestic. Mrs. Phillips rallied a good deal in the fine country air during the first year of her residence in Woburn; but the second, her health sank again in consequence of a severe cold she took in some ex- posure during the late Autunin; and Margaret Phillips was kept in fluctuations of hope and fear for her mother's life during the whole Winter. With the return of the Spring, Mrs. Phillips   THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.   119 began slowly to recuperate; but now another dread haunted the mother and daughter by night and by day--their slender means were nearly exhausted, and afar off they saw the "wolf" approaching their door. Margaret was not a girl to sit down and fold her hands in weak, unavailing tears and lamentations at this crisis. Not but the anxiety, and doubt, and ultimate decision, cost her much pain and many sleepless hours. But she reached it at last. And, not to prolong this subject, the next week Mr. Stebbins called, on Margaret, had a long inter- view with the young lady, which resulted in another visit, several evenings later, when Mr. Stebbins was accompanied by two other members of the commit- tee, and after an examination, which was merely nominal, she was installed teacher of the district school for that Summer. It was a little, low, long, red building with white shutters, on the side of the road where there were no trees, and the sun poured down with a sickening glare during the heats of the Summer, and within it were gathered more than forty boys and girls- many of them coarse, unruly, ill-bred. It was hard work for Margaret-hard for mind and body; yet she set herself to do it, and sum- moned all her moral forces to the work, and did it well, as any work that is worth doing at all ought to be done. Yet I think any one with fine intentions and gen-   120  THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.  erous sympathies would have looked sad, could they have glanced into the little, bare, red school-house that Summer, and seen the gentle, delicate, sweet- faced young teacher in her high chair, behind her brown desk, surrounded by those half-grown boys and girls, many of them so bent on the promotion of mischief, and petty annoyance, and disturbances, that in order to control them it was necessary to keep her thoughts and observation strained to their utmost tension. She looked too fair and fragile amid those rude boys and girls, and seemed more out of place than she actually was, for Margaret had in her nature some moral force which commanded respect, and to a large degree obedience. And she had various soils in which to sow her seed, and some of it took root there, and gave promise of a stronger, better man-. hood, a sweeter and more gracious womanhood. The school-house was situated less than a quarter of a mile from the new stone house, which was the pride and wonder of all Woburn, and as Margaret went up every morning through the green country lane to her school, the gray turrets of the stately house looked afar through the .green trees upon her, with the sunlight touching them into a new splendor. Somehow the sight of those turrets always hurt Margaret. If you had watched her narrowly, and seen the sweet light widening up into her dark eyes, and about her lips, as she listened to the   THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.   121 birds filling the air with their sprays of song, or looked off where, through the dark plush of meadow grass, the Summer winds went searching to and fro, you would have witnessed a sudden shadow sweep over her face as the gray turrets rose in sight, a shadow that blurred all ,the brightness, and was almost like pain. That stone house was- Margaret's vulnerable point all Summer. She was no faultless heroine-this lady of whom I write-dear reader. She would have opened her brown eyes wide at the thought of being one; but she was a woman, young, brave, lovely, struggling with herself, and all the hard realities of her lot-struggling for faith, duty, charity-- sometimes 'defeated, sometimes victorious. And this thought of the "great stone house" was the thorn in Margaret's side; she tried to put it away, but it came back and haunted her day by day. She thought of it in the hot, weary noon as she sat drooping before her desk in the hour of in- termission; the large, cool, luxurious rooms would rise and shine before her; she would see the soft, mossy carpets sprinkled with leaves and blossoms; she would see rare pictures and statuary scattered along the walls, and gleaming white in the corners, feeding with beauty the eyes which beheld and re- joiced in them; she would hear the sudden rush, and the sweet thrill and quiver of music that drew the quick tears to her eyes; and then she would see the lofty balconies where the June roses and honey- 11    122  THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE. suckles made heats of bloom about the pillars, and where, in the cool moonlight of the Summer even- ings, they told her the guests wandered up -and down; and then jets of laughter would suddenly thrill the air; and stately gentlemen and fair ladies would roam up and down the beautiful grounds, where the fountains threw up their white em- broidery of waters, or where the deep, green shrub- beries made darkness and stillness; or by the lake, where the stately swans went dreaming up and down, and the water-lilies, like great, white pearls, were scattered lavish on its bosom. Margaret knew' nothing of the inmates of the "stone house," except-that they were people of im- mense fortune, and, as their home indicated, of rare taste. -She had gathered, too, from the various gos- sip of the villagers, that the family was not large- a couple of sons and daughters. They had traveled for several years in foreign lands; and the girl fan- cied, without knowing, that they were haughty, purse-proud people. The only possible opportunity she could have had of meeting the family was at the village church, which they occasionally attended; but as they most frequently drove to service in the city, ten miles distant, it did not happen that Margaret met any of the residents of the stone house. But in her hours of weakness and weariness the young teacher thought of these people, dwelling in luxury, sur- rounded by all which could make the outward life   THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.   123 beautiful and happy, and her heart rebelled against her own hard, toiling, uncongenial lot. And so it happened one day, after the heats of the Summer had passed, and the earth was still and serene, and the ripeness of September flooded the year's pulses with wine, that Margaret Phillips sat at her chamber window just as she had sat in the brave life and  gladness of the June which would never come back any more. It was one evening after school, and, weary with her day's work, she had tossed aside her bonnet and shawl, and sat down at the window to refresh herself with the cool air, which was spiced with sweet fern, and sassafras, and pine from the woods on her right hand. The young teacher looked out, and drank in the sweet refreshment of air, and earth, and sky, with a face that grew peaceful as she gazed, till suddenly her roaming gaze fell upon the gray tur- rets of the stone house betwixt the trees. Margaret closed her eyes. "I believe that house is the Mordecai in the gate of my life," she said to herself in a tone made up of annoyance and self- reproach. "It haunts me   every-where, and spoils all my landscapes. I  heartily wish it could burn to the ground." "Margaret! Margaret!" whispered softly the con- science of the girl; and, heeding the admonition, she sat down and took counsel with herself. "After all, isn't it wrong," whispered the still inner voice, "for you to be disturbed in this way,   124  TEHE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE. and to let the sight of those turrets darken always over your sky? Does n't it prove some petty envy L or bitterness in your own nature, which it is your duty to struggle with and overcome? I know those people are rich, and you are poor; but you, at least, are wise and true enough to the best part of your- self not to think that can make any real difference betwixt you and them; and, see here, are n't you only indulging this unhappy morbid state of feeling by avoiding that stone house as carefully as you do? Is n't it your duty now to walk bravely over there and look it squarely in the face? And the more disagreeable the duty the plainer the neces- sity for performing it, and overcoming once and forever- the wrong, unhealthful feeling which has taken hold of you." And Margaret Phillips was of the number of those who, a duty set plain before them, would go to prison or the stake to do it; a woman who made I must, not I will, the great ruling force of her life. And so Margaret Phillips covenanted with herself that very evening to walk over to the stone house and look her "Mordecai" in the face, and then she went down stairs to help prepare her mother's supper. Poor Margaret! they kept but one servant, and she was a little girl. The sun was just behind the hills, leaving tile sky once more for its nightly blossoming .of stars, when Margaret closed her little cottage gate, and, took the old turnpike-road which intersected the   THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.   125 one that led to the stone house. It was a pleasant walk, and the soft light and the throbbing hum of the insects soothed her, and, walking with her own thoughts, she was greatly startled when, turning an abrupt angle in the road, she came suddenly upon the house. There it stood before her in its strength and stateliness, amid green shrubberies and beauti- ful grounds, which made a picture wonderful for loveliness all about it, itself the central beauty and grace of the whole. It seemed to Margaret Phillips, as she gazed on the Gothic pile, that she had been suddenly en- chanted into some   foreign country. She could hardly believe that that great, massive palace of stone rose in its simple, grand architecture on the. homely, every-day soil of Woburn, on the very land which the farmers sowed every Autumn, and plowed every Spring. It seemed to the girl's fine, poetic instincts--although be it here understood that Margaret Phillips had never written a  poem since she was a   school-girl--that that stone palace be- longed to the medieval ages, that old legends and old songs should cluster thick about it, that brave men's deeds and beautiful women's love and grace should have hallowed it;-and, musing on all these things, and entirely unconscious of herself, she strayed through the broad iron gate, and through the thick hedges of shrubbery, and smiled up to the frowning turrets-her own smile, brave, glad, victorious. They could not frighten her any more;   126  THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE. their power was gone; she had conquered them! And so Margaret Phillips, following the serpen- tine path, came into the vicinity of the house. The quietness wooed her on, for, although the doors were open, there was no sight or sound of human life about the dwelling. And so the girl approached the veranda on the right side of the house, and, leaning against a large horse-chestnut-tree, stood still and drank in with hungry eyes the scene be- fore her. Suddenly there came the sound of light voices and rapid steps to her ear, and a moment later a company of gentlemen and ladies poured through the wide doors and scattered up and down the great veranda, some of the latter playfully flut- tering over the mosaic pavement. Margaret stood still under the horse-chestnut in some natural embarrassment, hoping that she should -not be discovered, and would be able to make her escape unobserved. She had no idea what a picture she made, just in front -of the old tree, with the- sunset dropping its golden festoons all about her.- She, stood there, in her straw hat and the delicate lawn dress which two years before had been- her father's gift, for one moment in a flutter of embar- rassment; the next her feet were bound to the spot, and she lost all consciousness of her position, for there were three faces amid the company which she recognized, and the first of these was an elderly lady, with a portly figure and self-complacent coun- tenance, near whom for a moment stood two grace-   THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.   127 ful, haughty-looking girls. And this lady and those girls were the wife and daughters of the former senior partner of Mr. Phillips, the man who had wronged her father as no other man had ever done, the man who had taken advantage of Mr. Phillips's implicit confidence in him, and, managing to evade the law, had yet contrived to get his younger part- ner s property into his own hands, and availed him- self Qf Mr. Phillips's illness to control entirely the firm and so involve matters that, at the latter's death, the widow and- the daughter had been left penniless: and, intimate as the families of the part- ners had previously been, Mrs, Lathrop and her daughters had entirely neglected Margaret and her mother after the change in the latter's circum- stances. The Lathrops were living in splendor now on their ill-gotten, gains; and all this surged and stormed through Margaret's soul as she gazed on them and thought of her delicate mother struggling with ill health and poverty in their lonely cottage, and of her own hard, daily, toilsome life, and of him whose strong arm and loving heart would have shielded them from all this injustice and suffering. She stood still, with her pale face bent sternly on the veranda, almost wondering that some voice from heaven did not cry out against those people for the wrong which they and theirs had done her. And while the girl stood there a group of gentle- men and ladies turned suddenly toward that side of the veranda nearest her, and started as they all   1281  THE TURRETS OF THE STONE IIOUSE. caught sight of the still figure under the chestnut- tree. "Who is that lady?"Margaret heard the sur- prised question from more than one voice. "Ellen, she is a lady; you had best go out and proffer her our hospitality," said one of the young gentlemen to a lady who stood near him. "OO, I know who it is!" interposed at this moment an errand boy, who came up with some letters; "she is the district school-teacher; my cousin goes to her." "Really, Ellen," interposed at this moment Julia Lathrop, the elder of the girls; and she tossed her haughty head, and her laugh and her words came silver and scornful to Margaret's ear--"I don't think I should give myself much trouble for the sake of a schoolma'am, instead of some princess in disguise, as I fancied the lady might be. Your hospitality would doubtless overwhelm her. But, dear me," shrugging her pretty shoulders, "I don't think such people ought to be allowed to wander around people's grounds in this fashion. It encour- ages too much- freedom on their part." It was quite evident that Miss Lathrop had not recognized Mar- garet, or she would not have made this speech. "I think so, too," chimed in softly Caroline, the younger of the sisters. The words and the laugh stung Margaret into a white calm. Some impulsion outside of herself seemed to send her out from the great horse-chest-   THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.   129 nut. She walked slowly and steadfastly right up to the people on the veranda, and confronted with her white face the dozen others that were bent down in amazement on her. The start and look of blank consternation on three of those faces warned Margaret that they had rec- ognized her; and turning to Julia Lathrop, she said in her clear, soft voice, which kept its tone steadfast to the end: "You will please tell your friends, Julia, as you well know, that they have nothing to apprehend from freedom on my part; and as you do not perhaps know, I take here occa- sion to tell you that if your father had dealt hon- estly or justly by mine, if he had not through all the years that he was his partner,and on his dying bed, wronged and robbed him, my mother would not be now dwelling in poverty and obscurity, neither should I be a schoolma'am." The words fired Margaret's lips, and she could not hold them back. Their effect can not easily be described. Every one on the veranda heard them, and stood still, gazing from the young teacher to the Lathrops. They were all, mother and daugh- ters, so overwhelmed with surprise, mortification, and it may be so conscience-stricken, that they could not utter a word. They stood there still, with crimson faces, looking confounded and con- victed. And so Margaret turned away, and walked alone down the avenue which led out of the grounds. O   130  THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE. The feeling which had sustained her for a time gave way as she was out of every one's sight. The gray turrets only looked down on the girl and saw her stagger feebly beyond the gate, and the tears flowed still from the brown eyes of Margaret Phil- lips. She had not gone far when a quick step aroused her, and turning her tear-stained face, she saw the young gentleman who had proposed to extend her some courtesy when she stood under the chest- nut-tree. He was a man about thirty, tall, with a fine figure, and a face that was all that and more, for though it was not handsome, it was a good, strong, cultivated face, a face which compelled you to believe it, for it was inspired with justice, and courtesy, and real truth and manliness of character. "Madam," said the young gentleman, lifting his hat with a grace which no courtier could have rivaled to a lost princess, "if you will do us the honor to accept it, we- shall be most happy to send you home in our carriage. I fear you will find it a somewhat long and lonely walk at this late hour." Margaret Phillips little suspected the beautiful and eloquent thanks which her brown eyes flashed ap through their tears to the gentleman, before her lips, all unbent now, and with a little tremulous flutter about them, answered: "Thank you. I am familiar with the road and with loneliness too, so I am compelled to decline your courtesy." He did not renew it; he had fine intuition enough   THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.   131 to perceive that the girl must prefer just now to be alone, so he answered, with a smile, and the smile of Gilbert Sackett was not just like the smile of, most other men, for higher elements entered into it: "I hope, then, ma'am, you will give us some opportunity of renewing our courtesy at some time that shall find greater favor with yourself. We have only just learned you were our neighbors." And he lifted his hat and left her. And Margaret went her way alone, and the young moon was like a silver lily blossoming amid the golden buds of stars which filled the sky. Three years have passed. In a small alcove which opened out of the sitting-room in the stone house were gathered one day Mrs. Phillips, and Margaret, and Gilbert Sackett. The elder lady was a pleasant, gentle, dignified woman, and the bands of soft brown hair, faintly sifted with gray, lay smoothly about her face, which still retained something of the beauty of its girlhood. The gen- tleman and lady were hardly changed in these years, except that Margaret's face shone with a light and joy which it- never wore in those days when she carried it up to the old red school in faith and patience. Margaret was seated by the bay-window, looking, with eyes that read its new meanings every day, to the beautiful landscape which stretched before her in a rain of June sunlight, the soft winds ruffling   132  THE TUBRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE. the short grass and loitering among the rare and beautiful shrubberies, and as she gazed a flock of thoughts or memories came inlto her head and over her face, which, although these were not sorrow, yet were touched with something tender and sad. "What are you thinking of, my little wife?" asked Gilbert Sackett; and he tossed aside the paper, threw himself on the lounge, and leaned over toward Margaret. Her- hand, her soft, cool hand, moved tenderly through the short, thick, chestnut hair. "What makes you ask that question?"-with a faint, smile just touching her lips. "O, several things! Why don't you answer it, Mrs. Sackett?" "Had I better indulge him, mamma?" said the lady, and this time the smile was emphasized into archness as she turned toward her mother. "Now, mother, I interpose with a protest there," exclaimed the gentleman. "You know you gave up your right and title here into my hands a year and a half ago, and my claim on her is absolute." "I believe it is," answered Mrs. Phillips, smiling fondly on her children. "There, Margaret, you hear!" "Well, if you put it in that light," smiled the young wife, "I see no choice left but obedience and confession. So, I was thinking of some mornings, which are not so far off but that they rise up very vividly before me now and then, and wondering how   THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.  133 I should have felt at that time had any one told me, as I went up through the lane to the old red school- house, and caught sight of the gray turrets that used to haunt and trouble me so, that in less than three years I should be the mistress here!" "What should you have felt, little woman?" laughed Gilbert Sackett, pinching the small rose in his wife's cheek. "It is impossible for me to tell. Yesterday, when you were away, I walked up through that old lane, and tried to feel as I used to, and to contrast the past with the 'to-day.'" "And did you succeed, my dear child?" asked her mother, for both husband and parent were evi- dently touched with Margaret's simple-avowal. "Well, partly. I hope that I realize both with sufficient force and vividness to gather some lessons, some good from out them." "Ah, Margaret, you are not like other women; you never were, and from that first time that I looked on your face till this day, you have always been unconsciously doing something quaint and orig- inal, something to startle and surprise me." The small rose widened into bright bloom in the cheek of Margaret Sackett. "O, Gilbert, I was not seeking for quaintness or originality then!" "My   darling, nobody would ever suspect you of that. Do   you suppose so prosaic and sensible a man as I am would have been so completely con- quered at first sight as I was, had I not known well   134  THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE. a vast deal more than you suspected, O innocent Margaret?" - "I wonder what gave me courage to do and say what I did at that time?" said the lady, speaking softly, half to herself. "I don't; it was like you at such a time and under such circumstances. And, Margaret, I close my eyes, and see the whole scene again." Before the lady could answer, a domestic sud- denly entered with some letters for Mr. Sackett. Breaking the seal of the first one, with an apology to the ladies, he read for a little while. At last he looked up. "Ellen and her husband have taken a house near Paris, and mother and Elizabeth will remain with them for a year or two; so, Margaret, you are sole mistress of the stone house, turrets and all." "How those turrets are changed to me now!" she said. "They stand to me, wherever I catch a glimpse of them, as a sign of all home-warmth, and grace, and happiness, and I have grown to love and welcome the sight of them always." ",Margaret, shall I tell you just what I am thinking of just now?" "Yes; I shall be glad always to know your thoughts, Gilbert"--her little fingers braiding themselves once more in the bright chestnut hair. "I am thinking that you are a very good woman, Margaret-the best woman, it seems to me, that God ever gave a man for his especial love and   THE TURRETS OF THE STONE HOUSE.   135 cherishing; and that I shall be a truer, better man because of your power and influence about my life." He spoke solemnly, fervidly now, looking into her face. The tears were in her brown eyes -now, as she leaned over him and said: "O, Gilbert, what you last said is the one prayer of my life!" And Mar- garet Sackett did not suspect that that prayer was its own fulfillment!   r C B b   HOW  ONE WILL WAS MADE. CHAPTER     I. "TAKE a chair, sir-take a chair, sir!" said Mr. Jerome Reynolds to the minister. And he said it with some unusual quality of cordiality in his voice, and urbanity in his manner; for be it here premised, that Mr. Jerome Reynolds was one of the wealthiest men in Woodside, and rather accustomed to receiv- ing a certain degree of deference from those with whom he was brought in social juxtaposition; so that his own bearing had acquired a certain self- complacency, bordering on pompousness, which a, man is very apt to have who carries with him always an agreeable consciousness of some superior- ity to his fellow-men. Mr. Solomon Dayton, the pastor of the large Congregational Church at Woodside, was a gentle- man of the old school, and he accepted the luxuri- ous arm-chair in his usual courteous and somewhat elaborate manner-not a whit more elaborate to- ward his host and wealthiest parishioner than he was, an hour before, to his washer-woman, when, in 12       137   138    HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE. a flurry of embarrassment and pleasure, she placed her rocking-chair for him in the front room of her yellow one-story cottage, in the small alley which bounded the back grounds of Mr. Reynolds's resi- dence. The clergyman and- his host would have formed that morning an attractive study to eyes looking out of a keen, thoughtful soul. There was a sin- gular contrast in the two faces, as they sat opposite each other, in the lofty sitting-room of the stateliest dwelling in all Woodside. They were both old men-the host and his guest--and the locks of both were frosted white with their years. Mr. Reynolds's expression-,was of that keen, rapid, intel- ligent kind, which years of dealing with his fellow- men, and of contact with them in business relations, and the faculty of sharp foresight and swift prac- tical deductions, is apt to give a man. Mr. Dayton's face was of altogether a different cast, an ample, scholarly, intellectual face, somewhat pale, and re- fined by serious thought and study, and possessing beyond that a kindliness and sympathy which no words can reach, but which the meekest and lowli- est can feel, and which was wanting in the other. So the old gentlemen sat together and talked, and the sunshine, broken by the heavy curtains, spattered the carpet, and laughed broad along the walls, and gilded the massive old furniture. And the talk of the two gentlemen touched on various general topics, philosophical, political, moral; for   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.     139 this latter element always seasoned, like some fra- grant spice, the speech of the clergyman, Solomon Dayton. And at last, in a pause of this desultory talk, the banker cleared his throat and said, in a graver tone: "I've wanted to see you, my friend, for several days, to consult you on a matter that's been weigh- ing on my mind for a year or two; and there's no man whose advice in this thing will carry with it quite so much weight as yours." "I shall be very happy to give you any counsel that 's in my power, sir," answered the clergyman, tapping the arm of his chair, softly. "I was certain of that at the beginning; and, to reach the point at once, Mr. Dayton, I'm reminded almost every day, by some growing weakness or infirmity, that I'm an old man now, and that I must soon leave my place and my work to others; and I think it's every man's duty to make his will while he is in full possession of his reason and. health." "Just so-just so. We ought not to leave any work undone while the day lasts, my friend; and, as you say, it's getting toward night with you and me now," added the clergyman, who viewed the matter from a somewhat different stand-point from his parishioner. "I'm anxious to secure this money from being scattered to the four winds when I am gone. I should. like to feel it was doing a little good in the   "O   S-OW ONE WILL WAS MADE. world. It has cost me a life of hard, steady toil; wo trld r  e     w a abo ve it- a .  sing rl a for I made every dollar of my fortune m yselfsir Mr. Reynolds added this with a good deal of com- placency, and it did not strike him at the time that, however anxious e ight f e about the good his wealth shoula accomplish when he was under he had never manifestee any solicitude on ha score while he was aove  it--a singulr fact in the history of many rich men. "That is certainly a natural desire for a man whom the Lord has- made steward of s large a portion in his household," answered the clergyman, out of the sincerity of his heart. "My friend, I shall be glad to aid you all I can; and on every side there are noble institutions and blessed char- ities languishing for means to carry them on to the full attainment of their high purposes, both or God and man. But a man owes something to  is friends and relatives, if they are deserving; and I suppose these, in your case, will receive, as they justly should, the first consideration? Certainly -Mr. Reynolds had never put himself to himself in that light before; never conceived it pos- sible that he could occupy the relation of debtor to any man in the world. He moved a little uneasily in his chair. "I have, as you know, my ear sir, no family of my own, and most of my distant relatives are well provided for, with the exception perhaps of a single family--that of the widow and orphans of my late   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.      141 half-brother, Lucius Reynolds. I have, of course, a number of legacies to leave, and old friends to re- member in my will." "And this family of your late brother's? I think you spoke of them as being possessed of small means?" pursued the clergyman, to whom the very sound of widow and orphans had something touch- ing and significant. Mr. Reynolds settled himself back in his chair- "Ye-es," speaking half to himself, half to his min- ister, "I imagine that must be the case, although, to own the truth, I have heard little or nothing of the family since the death of Lucius, some eight years ago. He left three or four children, I be- lieve; but the family moved off into New York State some time previous to his death. The truth is, Lucius never had any business capacity, and would be sure to come out a poor man, let him put his hand to whatever he might." And here the speaker's tone was pendulous betwixt pity and con- tempt. "He was a good-hearted, good-natured fel- low, honest to the core, sensible and intelligent, too. I believe he was cut out for a scholar, if circum- stances hadn't baffled him there; but, though he had as fair a chance as I did, he was sure to come out without a dollar." "Ah, my friend, you to whom the Lord has given the power and capacity of gaining wealth, owe him a great debt of thanks," said the minister. Mr. Reynolds had, during the course of his long   "2    H ow ONE WILL WAS MADE. life, been much more in the habit of giving the glory to his own business sagacity and energy, in- stead of to his Maker; but perhaps he was not just then conscious of this. "I suppose we," do he answered, which was, after all, little more than a verbal acquiescence he felt bound as a matter of course to render to the nister remark. As I was saying, I have n't heard from the family for years. Lcis was ten years my junior; but I '1 hunt them up, and remem- ber them, for the sake of relationship, in my will." And then the rich banker went on to state to his pastor that he wished to endow the young college at Woodside, on which the minister's heart was set, with a hundred thousand dollars, and found a oung men's institute; which would take another hundred thousanld, and leave a fund to remodel the ancient church; and the good old clergyman's heart was in all these things, and he entered into them with the deepest enthusiasm; and so, before noon, the whole four hundred thousand dollars, which Jerome RPeynolds had been all his life heaping to- gether, was disposed of; and at last the clergyman drew his handkerchief across his forehead, heated with the eagerness of his talk, and said, with a smile: "Well, my friend, though you leave neither wife nor children to inherit them, yet you have not gathered together your riches for nothing. Your arne will not die with you, for generations will   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.     143 rise up and call you blessed, long after you have laid still in the grave." These were very pleasant words to the rich old banker from his pastor--from the man, too, whose character he respected, and whose piety he revered above that of all other men. It somehow made him feel that the road to heaven would be a very smooth one to him, and that his pastor's testimony would be indorsed there. And at that moment the servant entered, bring- ing in a waiter, with cake and coffee, and a dish heaped with small early pears, that seemed like a pile of jewels of gold and opal, as the sun struck in and over them. "Now, my friend, we've settled these things, and I shall have the will drawn up, signed and sealed before another Saturday night goes over my head," said the host. "You'll take a little lunch after your long talk?" "Thank you!"The clergyman looked at his watch. "We keep up very primitive customs at our house, and dine at one; and it wants only half an hour of it." "No matter, a cup of coffee and a little fruit won't spoil your appetite." And, partly for courtesy's sake, the minister ac- cepted the invitation; and while he was sipping his coffee, and secretly congratulating the town of Woodside on its good fortune, the thought of the banker's dead brother presented itself to his mind   "4    ROW ONE WILL WAS MADE.            ' again. He was a just man to the core, and so he said, suddenly, "I hope, my dear sir, that in these grand public charities of yours, we have not forgotten any private ones. We must be just in the least, as well as in the greatest matter; and a rich man owes, as I said, something first to his relatives, if they need it, and are worthy/of it. You will not forget this orphan family of your brother's?" Somehow, while Mr. Reynolds was very enthu- siastic about all his public donations and endow- ments, he never felt a particle of interest when his brother's family was mentioned. Indeed, although he never troubled himself to divine the cause, he was conscious of a certain feeling of aversion when- ever the subject was alluded to. But the minister thrust the matter home in the light of a debt and a duty, and so, to appease his conscience on the sub- ject, Mr. Reynolds answered: "Well, I will make some inquiries here, and, if they need it, I will put them down for twenty-five thousand dollars in my will. That will certainly be generous enough to a family whom I have not seen for fifteen years, and who probably expect nothing of me."  Parson Dayton agreed with his host, and soon after took his leave. In less than a week after the conversation trans- pired betwixt the banker and the clergyman, the former happened to meet a gentleman who resided   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.     145  in the pleasant country town in New York where his brother had lived and died, and was buried. Mr. Reynolds made various inquiries respecting the family of his relative, and was answered in a brief, matter-of-fact way; for the gentleman of whom the inquiries were made was one of those practical busi- ness men who have little interest or sympathy to spare for others. Mr. Reynolds, however, managed to learn that the widow and her four children were all living, and that although the family were highly esteemed in the community, they were left without any fortune, and the delicate motherand her young sons and daughters must have had a hard struggle with the world. Hearing this, for the moment, the heart of Mr. Reynolds softened. The memory of his now dead brother rose up from the east land of his soul, and walked over the billowy years, and stood tender and fair in the west of his life. He plunged his hand into his pocket, and glanced toward his writing- desk with a half-defined purpose of sending his sister-in-law a check for a few hundred dollars; and it seemed to him that the fair face of his dead wife, and his two sweet young children, who had slept side by side so long, looked down over the billowy years and smiled on him. But the gentleman went on to speak of other matters, and Mr. Reynolds thought, "No matter, it will do just as well after he has gone," and the face that had arisen and walked out of the land of 13   "O6    HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE. his youth, and the faces which had shone down on him out of the later years faded away, and when the rich man was left alone again to take counsel with his own thoughts, the old griping and grudg- ing of his wealth, which had taken such deep root in his soul, vanquished his better impulses again. "They'll have that twenty-five thousand in a lit- tle while," said Jerome Reynolds to himself. "I've done well by them in my will, and I han't live long to keep them away from enjoying it. Little they'll be apt to care for that under the circumstances. And so putting it in this light he grew slightly indignant with these, his nearest relatives on earth, and somehow felt himself a wronged, ill-treated man, and at last took refuge in the thought of how people would talk and wonder when his will was made known; and he wondered, too, whether the new buildings, which were to-be erected on the site he had designated in his last will and testament, would be christened the Reynolds Library. It would certainly be most natural and fitting that they should be! CHAPTER II. THE little white cottage sat pleasantly behind its two small, drooping firs. 1ignonnette, and helio- trope, and moss roses, made their white and purple foam ,and their coals of bloom on the small circular   -IOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.     147 mound which tasteful hands had raised a few feet from the front windows. Altogether, that little cot- tage would somehow have attracted and held your gaze, if you are the kind of person I hope you are, O my reader! Inside of this little cottage, whose roof, you saw at once could not cover more than six or eight rooms, sat, on the Summer morning of which I write, four of its five occupants. The elder of these was a lady past the prime of her years; and yet you would hardly have called her old, although her dark hair was so thickly tufted with gray, and a few lines were graven deep in her forehead, and the pale, smooth cheeks had dropped all their bloom years ago. It was a sweet, sad, motherly face--a face over which you felt at the first glance terrible storms had thundered, and left it waiting patiently and steadfastly. A little way from the mother sat a young girl, who hardly looked her years, and they were only sixteen. It was the mother's face over again, with all the thin outlines softly rounded, and the carna- tion bloom in the cheeks--a delicate bloom that, looking on, you felt rude winds or any rough usage would surely blight and quench. The young girl's face was half-hidden by the thick, soft hair which shaded the cheeks, and stood out in a rich maroon hue where the sunbeams touched it. She was wholly absorbed as she sat by the table in some volume over which her head was bent low.   "8    HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE. And in an opposite corner sat a boy and girl, he in his fourteenth, and she in her twelfth year. They were shelling peas, which half an hour before they had gathered from the garden; and the roses they had found there burned healthful in both their cheeks. They were a pretty picture, sitting there with their young heads bowed over the large tin basin, into which flowed constantly the small tribu-' tary of peas, that the pods furnished to their rapid fingers. The boy had a bright, eager, open face, a good deal sun-burnt with working outdoors, and the girl's had some general resemblance to her brother's a pretty, childish face, with wide, blue, wondering eyes, which seemed to hold a laugh that some' thought or experience had touched with seri- ousness. "Elizabeth, my child," said the mother, in her sweet, anxious tones to her elder daughter, as she laid down her sewing, "do leave that book for a little while. You'll be sure to get sick again if you don't take care." Elizabeth Reynolds looked up with a little plead- ing smile that touched her whole face with a new life. "I- think I shall stand it this time, mamma," she said. "You know next week the committee meet, and if I can get through with the examination, I, shall have the school--Mr. Jacobs said I should, and then there.'ll be four dollars a week for us!" It was worth something to hear the tone of joy-   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.     149 ful triumph with which she uttered these last words, The little girl in the corner paused in her work, and a very plethoric pod scattered its contents on her lap, and they freckled over her gingham apron as she whispered: "Just think how much money that will be, Harry!" "I know it, Ellen. Some day, though, I mean to make a good deal of money too!" Here the mother's voice interposed again. "I know it's a good deal of money, dear, but I don't see how in the world you can take such a responsibility on yourself at your age, and with your health. Then there's that long walk of a mile and a half every morning and evening!" "O, mother, I can, I will do it," answered Eliza- beth Reynolds, her fair young face kindling with solemn  purpose. "Don't you know  what  this money will be to all of us, and how it will help lift the dreadful burden off poor Norman's life, and get you a doctor, and do so many things for all of us! As for the walk, it '1 do me good on pleasant days, and Mr. Jacobs says he'll take me over in the milk-cart on stormy ones. He's the best friend we've got in this world!" Mrs. Reynolds sighed to herself. She thought of her young son toiling beyond his strength and his years for his widowed mother and his orphan brother and sisters, and her heart ached for him.   150    HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE. Poor woman, it had ached on through the long, slow, weary years, till it seemed to her that she could hardly remember a time when it had been free from gain! She thought of that slow, iron poverty which lay so heavily and terrible on all their lives, and of the Winter that was coming, and she did not dare to enter a protest against her daughter's determination to take the district school that year, inadequate as she knew Elizabeth's years and health were to so' arduous and responsible a work. Ten years ago- Mrs. Reynolds had seen the hus- band of her youth covered up under the gray flan- nels of the Autumn grass. She was a delicate, tenderly-reared woman, very little fitted for hard wrestling with the world. But she had four help- less children left dependent on her alone, and for their sakes she roused herself and struggled with the world as she never could for her own. Her husband had been unfortunate in all his later business enterprises, and a few debts, and a few hundred dollars, was all that he left to the widow. Mrs. Reynolds possessed the genius of economy. She managed to live somehow with the help of those few hundred dollars, by renting a small cot- tage, cultivating the acre of ground about it, and teaching a small school. But at last her health failed -her, her little fund was exhausted; and then 'her eldest son obtained the situation of under- clerk in a wholesale store-in the town. So they   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.     151 had managed to exist for the last three years, de- pending mostly on Norman's wages, which it almost broke the mother's heart to take. But the exercise of the most rigid economy could not entirely avert the debts which slowly accumulated on one side and another. The whole of these did not at this -time amount to two hundred dollars; but it was enough to haunt the soul of the mother, by night and by day, like some awful presence of terror, and eat with its slow rust into the very springs of her life, and lie with its brooding shadow on the blossom- ing youth of her children! Dear reader, God forbid that I should magnify in any wise the value of money! Riches heaped to- gether for the good of the owners thereof, and be- queathed to children, are perhaps oftener a curse than a blessing, and may so be read when the books 'are opened and the day shall declare it! Good, brave, strong wrestling with poverty never yet hurt any man-it has made thousands! How many a youth has been ruined, body and soul, whose life might otherwise have been a bless- ing to himself and his generation, because a fortune fell to him 1 How many a poor, nervous, morbid, in- dolent woman, absorbed in herself, and in her own narrow life and petty needs, has been made all this because her money precluded the necessity of all- healthful exertion and activity- on her part, and made all -the forces of her life centripetal, no one can undertake to declare!   152    IIOW ONE .WILL WAS MADE. But the weak, the tender, the delicately reared, and helpless, they who need the strong arm and the stout heart to shield them from the storms and the struggle of life-to them, when left alone and out in the cold of the world to'do battle with it-to them is poverty a curse- a thing bitter, and strong, and terrible, beyond all that my pen can write. Surrounded on all sides with its darkness, with no earthly hand to, help or -to deliver--the mean, the greedy, the coarse, and the selfish taking ad-, vantage of their want and weakness, to press and insult them if they are any-wise in their power-0, to these, the young, the weak,- the helpless-God be witness that the words which I write here are words of truth and honesty-is poverty a bitter and a fearful thing! It was this to the wife and the children of Lucius Reynolds; and yet the brother who had dwelt with him under one roof, and with whom  he played through the bright years of his early boyhood, could, without feeling it, by a mere stroke of his hand, have bestowed on them a few hundreds of his many thousands, and lifted all the weight and the cold dread from the heart of the mother'and the young lives about her, and made them brimming over with gladness! It was no excuse for him that he did not know all this-that if any body had presented it to him in such a light, he certainly would have done some-   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.     153 thing. It was his duty to search out and know the truth. Were they not his relatives! and does not a man owe to them his first duty and fealty? Truly God declares how he values wealth, in 'the sort of men whom he often allows to attain it! And as the little group sat there that Summer morning, with rifts of sunshine on the faded carpet and old-fashioned chairs-relics of better and hap- pier days-the door was suddenly thrown open, and Norman Reynolds entered the room. He was a slender youth, with the same thoughtful, delicate cast of features as his sister--bold and strong enough not to be feminine though. With the first glance at his face, his family saw that something had happened to him; it was white as a living face can be, and a terrible, wild despair was in his brown, large eyes. "O, what is the matter, my boy?" asked the mother, and her heart leaped into her voice. The youth sat down and looked on each of them in a haggard, bewildered way, which was pitiful to see. "I've lost my place this morning." He said it in slow, hopeless tones, which told how the iron had entered his soul. "O, Norman!" Even the mother's cry of surprise and pain was added to the chorus of her children. "It's true. You'd got to know the truth, and there was no way to keep it from you if I lived at   154    HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE. all, and God knows how I longed to die before I should come home and utter these words to you! They said they'd no fault to find with me. I'd done the best that I could; but they wanted stouter muscles and heavier strength than I could bring to the work where thlere was so much lifting and lug- ging to be done; so they'd got a stout young Ger- man in my place. What is to become of us now, mother?" There was no answer--a cold chill crept over each one. They looked in each other's white faces and found no comfort there. "And our rent is due, and we haven't a dollar in the world to meet it! O, mother, it isn't for my sake that I care, but for yours, and the children's!"  Then the courage and faith which lay at the core of Mrs. Reynolds's soul, and which had carried her through all these years, roused themselves at the sight of her crushed boy. "Don't give, up, my darling," she said, in her sweet, brave tones. "God will not suffer us to perish. Some way that we do not look for, he will take care of us." And Elizabeth, to whom  Norman was dearer than her own life, slipped over to his side and put her soft cheek down to his, and her little- fingers fluttered tenderly in his brown curls, as she whis- pered: "Don't take it so hard, Norman dear. I feel   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.     155 almost certain that I shall get the district school, and I shall earn four dollars a week, and that's as much as your salary into one dollar; we shall get on somehow, I know we shall." "And I'm just going to ask farmer Jacobs to- find me a place as chore-boy, somewhere," said Harry, getting up, and looking very fierce and brave; "and I can earn a dollar a week, I'll bet now." "And I mean to get some of the bags from the factory," chimed in the childish voice of Ellen, as she pushed back her golden curls from her girlish face. "I can make four a day, and get twenty-five cents a dozen!" And so-brave hearts-they tried to comfort the elder brother, till at last he put his hand over his eyes, and when he drew it away there were tears in their brown depths. The brave, tender, hopeful youth-he was comforted at last. "Mother, is n't there somebody in the world who would be willing to help us a little just now we might pay them some time, and it would not seem just like applying for charity?" asked Eliza- beth. The mother shook her head; and then a moment later looked-up. "Your father had an only brother and he was a rich man," she said, "If I knew where he was living, I should certainly write to him, and in the name of the dead entreat him to do something for   156   : HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE. the living. But I lost all knowledge of him years ago." "Our help must come of ourselves and God!" said Elizabeth, and her young face seemed trans- figured for the moment with the brave, steadfast smile that glowed all over it. "I shall go off in a few days if I can't get any thing to do here," interposed Norman, and so they all took comfort and courage at last. And in this town where Mrs. Reynolds and her children lived were many wealthy people; many broad-minded, generous people too, whom any tale of sorrow or suffering would have touched, who never allowed a beggar to go unfed or unclothed from their door. But because Mrs. Reynolds never made any sign of her need, because -she was a gen- tlewoman by birth, breeding, and life, who could not solicit charity, it never entered the minds of these people that they-might bestow theirs in some such delicate manner as should not wound her natural sensitiveness. It never entered the minds of these people, I said, but it should, for they knew that her husband had died insolvent, and left his invalid wife and children witl no resources. It would have. been easy enough for some gen- erous, unknown heart to have helped her in quiet, secret ways, so that she should never even have suspected the hand which was reached out to her rescue in the hour of her sore need, and verily the giver would not have-lost his reward.   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.      157 But people are as careless and injudicious in their charities as in most other things, and the coarse, the importunate, and often the undeserving get the most. Five days after Norman Reynolds had lost his place, his sister Elizabeth burst into the little sit- ting-room. The family happened to be all there, for it was just at sundown. "O, mother," she said, tossing her bonnet on the table, and fairly dancing up and down in her joy, "I've got the school! I've got the school!"It was the first gleam of light that had shone through the darkness about them. During this interval Norman had vainly exerted himself to obtain some employment. The delicate, slender youth was not fitted for that rough labor which required strong sinews and iron muscles, and consequently his efforts had been unavailing. Elizabeth brought further good tidings. Farmer Jacobs had agreed to take Harry during harvesting, and pay him a dollar a week. "There, now, don't look disconsolate any longer. We'll make up your salary betwixt us," cried the boy to his brother, after performing a series of gymnastics--the first ebullition of his delight at the news. But Mrs. Reynolds looked at Elizabeth, and her heart misgave her. She looked so young and deli- cate, so little fitted for the work which stark neces- sity forced upon her. ,y fore   158    HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE. "God help my poor child!" prayed the mother. "Next week I shall start off," whispered Norman to his mother. "The landlord will let us keep the house three or four weeks more, and now I shall not be haunted with the fear. that you are starving while I am gone!" "My dear boy!" and Mrs. Reynolds looked up, and smiled through her tears. Three weeks more went by, and- one afternoon in midsummer a wagon set Norman Reynolds down once more at the cottage door. He made an effort to dismount, but was unable to do so, and the driver who had brought him from the depot was obliged to lift him out as he would have done a little child. He staggered into the house, where loving, pitying faces gathered about him. A few words will tell the story he told them. For some days he had-been unsuccessful in obtaining employment, and : he had not sufficient means to procure comfortable lodgings; consequently, he had been much exposed during inclement weather. At last, however, he had succeeded in obtaining work at unloading a vessel; the labor was beyond his strength, the exposure was great; but he had determined to con- tinue at his post till the work was finished. So, with moral heroism which the angels took noteof, he staggered to his work every morning; his head would swim strangely-one moment cold chills would seize him, and chatter his teeth together, and shake him' to and fro as the bitterest blasts of   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.      159 Winter never did, and these would be followed by strange heats that throbbed fiercely in his temples, and beat in all his pulses, and left him at last half blinded, and with a sick faintness all over him. But the last day came finally; the work was done; he had earned fifteen dollars; and *s soon as he had received his pay, he had staggered off to the depot and come home. "And now, mother," he said, "I want to go to bed, and fall asleep with you sitting close by me, as I used to when I was a little boy. I have dreamed of it through all these long, slow days that I've been away from you." But he was too weak to walk to his bed at last, and that night Norman Reynolds lay in a raging fever, moaning about his mother and the rent that was unpaid, and the home that was so far off, and the work which was so heavy and hard! It was. heart-rending to hear him. He lay for the next week in the clutch of that terrible fever, which had drunk so deeply into his young life during that time of hard labor and exposure. As soon as his illness was noised abroad, people crowded in on all sides to do kindly offices for the invalid. The physician was unceasing in his atten- tions. The tables were heaped with all rare fruits and confections, which the sick youth could not touch, but the cost of which, a week before, would have saved all his suffering. The fever fired his brain, and paroxysms of in-   160    How ONE WILL WAS MADE. sanity alternated with stupors of insensibility. It was pitiful -to see him lying there, with his wild, brown eyes burning like coals out of his white face, and beseeching those who gathered around his bed- side not to take his place away, for his mother and sisters would starve if they did. But the end came at last. One night he seemed to be sleeping, and the watcher who took the post at midnight by his bedside fell into a doze. They knew afterward that Norman must have risen from his bed and. stolen out softly into the night. His strength could not have carried him far, but there was a pond only a short distance from his mother's door. He walked to the brink of this and sprang in. The water was hardly deep enough to reach to his shoulders, but he must have fainted away when it closed over him; and, in a little while, the life and the fever dropped forever from the brain of poor Norman Reynolds. The next morning they found him, and carried him home to his mother and his sisters; he would never have to go out again to seek for work! Of that morning we can not write; but the rich, child- less old man, in his stately home at Woodside, was responsible for that night's work-for that stricken home! Three years more had goine over the cottage roof where Mrs. Reynolds and her children still dwelt. They had been like the rest-years of steady   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.      161 struggle and battling with poverty and physical weakness. During all this time Elizabeth had kept her arduous position of teacher of the large district school, at a salary of four dollars a week in the Summer, and five in the Winter. Her brother, who was now sixteen, had a situa- tion as clerk in a dry-goods store, with a hundred and fifty dollars per annum, and these formed the entire resources of the family. On the Autumn afternoon of which I write, Mrs. , Reynolds sat in her old place by the window. The lines on her pale face had grown deeper since the death of her boy, and the silver shone brighter and thicker ina her hair. Ellen had just laid the table- cloth for supper. The round, childish face was blossoming into the soft outlines of early woman- hood, and the laugh held by the deep-blue eyes had lost somewhat more of its old merriment, but nothing of its cheerfulness. "Isn't it strange, mother, that Elizabeth don't come?" she asked, smoothing the corners of the fine ancient damask. "Yes, dear, I was just thinking of that. The wind is blowing up cool, too. I'm afraid it will bring on her cough again." The door opened, and Elizabeth Reynolds entered the room. She had grown taller and slighter in these three years, and the small roses were quite quenched in her fair young cheeks. She sat down in the nearest chair without removing her bonnet "   162    HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE. and shawl, and burying her face in her hands burst into tears. "Why, my darling, what is the matter?" eagerly asked her mother. "It's taken me two hours to'get home to-night, mother. I had to sit down three times on the road, and the pain in my side has been sharp as the cut of a knife all day. O, mother, my health has all gone!"' Mrs. Reynolds rose and walked feebly to her child-"My daughter," she said, "I have tried to shut my eyes to it for the last year. That school is killing you." "But, mother, I must die then, for I can not give it up so long as I can crawl or stagger there." "Yes, you can," interposed Ellen, coming for- ward, her eyes full of tears, but a brave purpose shining through them. "I can take your place, Elizabeth, for a while, till you get stronger. You don't know how -much this has been on my mind, nor how hard I've been studying lately in view of it; for I saw you were sinking under the work," A severe attack of coughing retarded the young teacher's answer, and before it was over there came a loud, hasty summons at the front door. Ellen answered it, and Mr. Jacobs, a sun-burnt, broad- shouldered, stolid farmer, with an honest, good- natured face, walked right in. Years ago he had been Mr. Reynolds's gardener, and had always proved himself a stanch friend of the family.   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.      16; "Mrs. Reynolds," speaking in his kindly, abrupt way, "here's a letter for you I just found at the post-office, and I thought I might as well step over on my way home, and hand it in." -The widow   took the letter in silent surprise. She did not recognize the bold, business hand, and opened the envelope in a little nervous tremor. It was written  by one of the executors of Jerome Reynolds's will, and briefly informed her that her husband's brother had died recently and suddenly, and had left her and her children in his will the sum  of twenty-five thousand dollars. Mrs. Reynolds laid down the letter. "What does it mean? -  what does it mean?"she asked, turning from one astonished face to the other; for the tidings had fairly bewildered her. It was too much--too good to believe. Mr. Jacobs seized the letter in some  alarm, and read it aloud, carrying his voice steady to the close. The sun-burnt face of the farmer was ra- diant for joy as he'finished. "Wall," was his characteristic comment, "if that 'ere an't the greatest windfall!" and he drew a long breath. Ellen was the first who seemed really to compre- hend the meaning of the letter. "I'll tell you what it is," she cried, amid her jets of happy tears- "it's life, and peace, and comfort to us all. It's rest and medicine for you, mamma, and  Elizabeth. It's a  new and pleasant   164  .  HOW ONE WILL- WAS MADE. home, and freedom from the long poverty, which has eaten into our very lives, for us all." Then Harry came in. These three years had changed him into a tall, slender youth. He was not long in hearing the good tidings. Of what followed it is easier to imagine than to write. The long darkness was over for them at last, and with the death- of Jerome Reynolds the -morning -had dawned for them. Harry and Ellen talked the most, and laid all kinds of plans for the future. "We'll rent some new, pleasant little cottage, Harry, and you shall have a horse and carriage, and take mamma and Elizabeth to ride every day; and you and I will go to the academy; and you can prepare for college-only think of it all!" "'It's glorious, Ellen. What makes you so still over it all, Elizabeth?" The young girl smiled. "I like to sit and hear you and Ellen talk, and think I shall not have to go to school to-morrow." "No, nor never any more-thank God!" said her mother. And in the hollow of Elizabeth Reynolds's cheek, there glowed now something that was like a bright living coal of fire; and the mother's voice broke tdp into sobs. "O, if my dead boy out yonder had only lived to see this day!" she said; and the glad faces around her all fell into a shadow of grief, The mother's lightened first.   HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.      165 "He has gone to possess better riches than these, nor would I now wish to recall him," she said, with a smile, that made her wan face beautiful. CHAPTER      III. "T'S a handsome monument, Harry." "Very, Ellen; and a handsome epitaph, too." The lady who spoke first was young-somewhere in her early twenties. She had a face that com- bined sweetness, refinement, and intelligence in a very rare degree; and the young man who stood by her side looked, as he was, a little her senior. He had a fine, manly countenance--one yo  would have respected and trusted at once. "But, somehow," continued Ellen Reynolds, "it seems to me that it might be better for the soul of Jerome Reynolds if part of his epitaph had never been written. 'Christian philanthropist,' 'public benefactor,' he might have been-true relative he never was, as three low graves, far away from this one, bear solemn witness. Norman-Elizabeth- mother-we might all be here to-day, a happy, unbroken family, if the man who lies under these green sods had done his duty to us. His money came too late to save Elizabeth--it was that school killed her; and it was the loss of Norman and Elizabeth that killed mother."   166    HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE. The words were suddenly checked here by a storm of tears and sobs, which shook the graceful young figure to and fro. The young man drew his arm around his sister. He was silent for a while, and his heart rose up for a moment in bitter accu-s sation against the dead, who lay at his feet. At last he spoke:                     i u"Ellen, he has gone where God, not we, shall judge him." She looked up-the sweet lady through her tears. "I know it,-Harry; and yet, when I stood to-day before that magnificent pile of buildings they called the Reynolds Library, and the crowds about us were making speeches,-and doing us honor for his sake, I was thinking of my blighted childhood- - of my brother's baffled and broken youth--of my sister's sweet and suffering girlhood-of my moth- er's long years of toil and sorrow--thinking, too, of all the noble promise and possibilities of Nor- man'smanhood, and Elizabeth's sweet, lost woman- hood; and standing there, I said to myself, sternly- and bitterly-'Jerome Reynolds, the money that laid the foundations of one of those buildings would have kept them all-on earth to this day; and that lofty pile and those low graves stand up to-day to witness against you.'" "I said all this, too, Ellen, sweet sister; and 'then I remembered"- "What?"      ,   ]HOW ONE WILL WAS MADE.     167 "That perhaps he and they had met together, and they would forgive him." Her flushed face dropped into calm. "If they have forgiven him, so should we," she murmured. "That is true, Ellen, and  though the money came too late to save them, it has been full of good and blessing for us." She looked up with a smile; and the smile of Ellen Reynolds was worth going far to see. "I thought of that yesterday, Harry, while you were delivering your oration at Commencement. fO Harry, these last years have been happy years "They have been happy years for the dead, too, darling sister, and they have what our mother said Norman had that night the fortune came-better riches than ours." She smiled again. "O0, Harry, your words comfort me!" "And we  will be- glad, not only for our own akes and for theirs, that while we have enough f   this world's goods for our need and comfort, fter much early suffering has taught us truly to ppreciate and enjoy them, they are gone where hey have the better, eternal riches." There were no more words spoken. They both oked up a moment at the lofty granite monument, whose foot slept all that was mortal of their lcle, Jerome Reynolds.   168    How ONE WILL WAS MADE. The capitol glowed brightly over them in the sunset light, and all-bitterness and indignation had faded from the eyes of Harry and Ellen Reynolds as they gazed on it. Then the lady took her brother's arm, and the two went silent and serious out of the cemetery at Woodside. And how many among the dead and the living are there like this man, Jerome Reynolds, of whom I have written. How many who hoard and clutch their wealth to the end, and then leave it to endow colleges, and 'found asylumsg and libraries, and all manner of high-sounding public institutions, while their own kindred may be secretly wearing down a life of suffering and toil into the grave, for want of a little of this wealth, hoarded in life, to buy a name after death! Ah, how many public benefactions are founded in private wrongs! How often he that is unjust in little, is generous in much! A man's first duty- first charity, is to hisbown kindred, although neither of them ends there; and he who thoughtlessly, heart- lessly, willfully neglects his own relatives, will find that all splendid public donations and charities, which men praise and trumpet with sounding brass and tinkling cymbal, will not purchase for them the kingdom of heaven. "It is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment!"         @  *    ,   AFTER THREE YEARS. "WELL, Mary, why don't you tell him     you won't stand this treatment?"The voice was re- monstrative, alm6st vehement. It was quite evi- dent that the speaker was considerably stirred. "There is no use, George.  I have left nothing undone to alter this state of things; but I can not move Robert Grover; he seems to delight in making my life miserable." The voice was not passionate, but weary and plaintive. "He's a   scamp!" This laconic statement was intensified by a  strong blow, which sent a shiver through the small oval table by which the speaker sat. Mary, the wife of Robert Grover, did not seem startled at the opprobrium which inhered in the epithet bestowed upon her husband, and yet she did not look like a  woman who was in any wise used to the hearing or the speaking of harsh words, as she sat rocking back and forth in her low chair, a few, feet from her brother, with her head resting against the back. It was a daintily-poised and prettily- shaped head, with bright, abundant hair; and the 15       169   170      AFTER THREE YEARS. face was a pretty one, too, with soft outlines, and sweet lips, and eyes pleasant to look within. I think a searching analysis might have penetrated to some wrong or want in- the face which had its meaning in something beyond. In certain phases of feeling like the present there was a disquiet and disappointment about it which had its root in the character, and did not indicate a soul in harmony with true and Christian ideals of life. 'Only to think, George, of my asking my hus- band for a new silk dress this morning--and I have n't had one since last April--and what do you think he said?" "I can't imagine, Mary; but I shouldn't be sur- prised at any thing, after what I've heard." "Well, he went off into a towering passion, and declared that he never saw a woman yet who had a particle of reason or common sense, and that it was absurd to talk to a man about silk dresses who was likely to fail before night, and he insisted that it would serve the whole race right if we had to come down, to linsey-woolsey, and spin and weave it ourselves, as our grandmothers did before us." George Humphreys leaned back in his chair and laughed outright-a laugh which was made up of indignation and amusement. Perhaps the latter triumphed at this moment. "That's just like a man," he said. "Get one of them provoked, and he's sure to go on after this fashion." "It was any thing to me but a matter to laugh   AFTER THREE YEARS.      171 at," subjoined Mrs. Grover, in tones which plainly showed that her brother's merriment at this junc- ture had hurt her. "O now, don't mind that, sis! It's outrageous that you should be insulted in this fashion, and you sh' an't be any more." "No, I don't intend to," answered Mary Grover, firmly and quietly. "I've made up my mind; these things have reached too terrible a pass for me to bear them any longer." "Well, Mary, what are you going to do now?" asked the young man, with solicitude; for there was an ambiguous threat in his sister's voice. "I am going to leave my husband, George Hum- phreys,; I am going out into the world to toil with my hands for my daily bread, rather than submit- any  longer to his tyrannies and insults."  Her tones were raised to a higher key now, as though they would admit of neither argument nor contra- diction, and the flush on the cheeks confirmed the words. "Why, Mary, has it come to this?" asked George Humphreys, shocked beyond further speech for the moment. "Yes, it has, George. You would not have your own and only sister stay here to drag out a life which is worse than death;" and a  great sob swelled the dainty throat over the snowy lace ruffling. "No, I   would n't, Mary, darling"--his fraternal   172   '  AFTER THREE YEARS. sympathies quickening again. "Only I did n't know but something further might be done before you take such a step. It's never best to be rash, you know." "I know it, George; but I have reflected on this subject for a long time, and I take the step de- liberately," "'I wish you had never seen that villain!" said George Humphreys, getting up and pacing to and fro the small, prettily-furnished sitting-room, where he and his sister were holding a conversation on which hung all the happiness or the misery of her future. "I wish that I never had seen him"--and here the sob in the young wife's throat burst in a gust of tears. "O, George, do you remember the dear old boy and girl days, when you and I were so happy together in the old home at Walpole, and how I used to sing 'The Watcher,' and 'The Old Sexton'--papa's favorite-every night after supper in the parlor, and how papa would pull me on his knee afterward, and finger my curls, and you and I would have a chase round the- old hall? Those were happy days, George!" "Very happy days;" and the young man's voice struggled a little before it conquered the words. -"And do you remember-further back still-the Autumn days, when you climbed the great pear- trees, and the yellow fruit came tumbling down on the grass, as I stood watching you with wonder while you called to me away up in the great boughs?"   AFTER THREE YEARS.      1 X73 "I remember it all, Mary;" and this time the voice of George Humphreys struggled harder than before, and he paused and stroked the bright hair of his sister. "Don't cry, darling"-for the tears came in great jets,. staining her cheeks. "And the times that you led me to school through the mulberry fields, and through the hick- ory grove, where we used to throw nuts at the shy squirrels? O, George, I wish that I had never left the old home! I wish I was the little girl that papa and you used to pet." It was not strange that the heart of George Hum- phreys was melted within him, for it was a heart young, and brave, and manly; it was not strange that, as he listened to the sobbed-out words of his only sister, he did not consider that a youth of such fondness and indulgence as that she pictured would not be likely to discipline her ardent, im- pulsive nature for the inevitable trials of life, or nourish the best possibilities of her character. He forgot, as he looked on the fair, tearful face of his sister, that she had been petulant and exacting, and, with all her loving4 impulses, that she was -irritable and unreasonable if ever so lightly crossed. George Humphreys only thought, with burning in- dignation, of the man who had taken to wife his beautiful sister, and broken her heart with unkind- ness and harshness, and his whole soul stirred with fresh anger toward the husband, and pity for the wife, as he lifted Mary from the chair, and seated   174     -AFTER THREE YEARS. her on the lounge, and, slipping his arm around her, said: -"There, don't shed another tear, dar- ling; you shall not live with this villain any longer. Come back to me; I 'll take tender care of you, as I did in the days before you were married. We 'll go back and live in the old homestead, and no human being shall dare to find fault with you so long as you've got a brother to shelter and defend you."* And Mary Grover put her soft arms around her brother's neck, and thanked him through her sobs. And it was settled then and there between the brother and sister that, Mary should accompany George when he -left the city, as business compelled him to do the next night. Mrs. Grover did not expect her husband home till the late evening train, and she and her brother would be several hours on the journey before he returned to his home and learned all he had lost. And a flush of triumph went over the young wife at the thought, for she knew that her husband would be utterly dismayed when he came to understand the decisive step to which his cruelty had driven her. "I hate scenes!" exclaimed George iHumphreys, as he rose to go, for the night was growing fast, and he had promised to' meet a friend at the St. Nicholas. "So it is lucky we shall avoid one, as the fellow happens to be absent. But I haven't done with Robert Grover yet, and one day he shall answer to me for his brutality to my sister."   AFTER THREE YEARS.      175 Mary caught her brother's arm with a cry of terror. The thought of a meeting between the two men, knowing as she did the fiery spirit of both when exasperated, filled her with dread, and she fancied herself haunted by life with a fear that her brother or her husband might fill by the -hand of the other. "George," said the white lips of Mary Grover, "promise me solemnly that you will never seek an interview with my husband so long as you live. Promise me this, or I can never leave his home for yours." "Why, AMary, it is my duty "- She checked him, shivering and shuddering. "No, George, I foresee what the consequences would be only too well. Promise for my sake and my peace, George." "Well, then, I promise, for I want you to be at rest, Mary. But it's hard to shut up my mouth in this way." This time it was shut up with fond kisses, and so George Humphreys went his way. It is useless to linger on the causes which had developed such unhappi ness in the life of Robert and Mary Grover. Both were greatly in the wrong, and each had somewhat to plead in exten- uation of his and her faults. Each had had a spoiled childhood, an indulged youth; each was exacting, and unconsciously and habitually selfish; and on the other side each was generous, warm- hearted, with most attractive and lovable qualities   176      AFTER THREE YEARS. of character. Marriage had been a keen disappoint- ment to both, for Robert and Mary Grover had been the most ardent of lovers, and the young hus- band and wife were appalled at the first disclosure of human frailties in the other. A. little self-sacrifice, a yielding to each other's wishes and tastes in the small details of every-day life, and the exercise of good common-sense, might have remedied all these things. But, alas! per- sistent self-sacrifice in little things was something to which neither the .young merchant or his wife were accustomed; and their judgment was blinded because their hearts were wrong! It is the old story. Things went from  bad to worse. Each grew soured and indifferent; a habit of incessant fault-finding, of petty recrimination and retort de- veloped itself, and the married life which had com- menced three years before under such sweet auspices of youth, and hope, and love, was become to both sorrow and bitterness, and neither could see that the remedy for, the great wrong lay in his or her soul. The road between New York and Philadelphia had been partially blocked up by the recent heavy fall of snow, and the ride was a slow and tedious one for all the travelers on the train that day. Robert Grover soon exhausted the morning paper, which seemed a particularly-sterile one, and then he looked out of the window awhile, as the cars toiled painfully along; but he only saw the dead   AFTER THREE YEARS.      1" woolens of Winter drawn level over the face of the earth. And as he sat there, with nothing especial to fix his attention, the words which he had spoken to Mary, his wife, that morning, came back to his memory. They did sound rather harsh and severe now, and he winced a little under them. "The truth is," thought the young merchant, settling his graceful limbs on the seat, for the cars were not crowded that morning, "I s'pose I did go a little too far; but she must come at me in just the wrong time, when I was bothered to death by that letter, telling me there was no help for it-I must start right off to-day for Philadelphia, or I'd lose every dollar that house was owing me, for it would be down before the week was out. I wonder if there ever was a woman, from Eve downward, who had the least idea of the bother and worry of a man's business, or who would n't attack him at the very moment when he was head over heels in trouble, and of course then he's sure to say the very worst thing he can!" And then the face of his wife came back to him as he had parted from it, with its white, still look, and the strange, settled expression of the lips, as though she had made some deadly resolve within herself; and he remembered how her gaze had fol- lowed him, steady and defiant, as he left the room. He had the- last word, too, which was. not often the case. - Robert Grover moved uneasily; the still, pale face troubled him more than any flush of   178      AFTER THREE YEARS. rage--the silence more than any angry recrimina- tion would have done, "I suppose," he mused, "Mary'll sit at home to-day, and brood over what I've said, and think I'm the greatest brute in existence! Ah, well! I wonder if marriage proves the failure in ninety- nine cases out of a hundred that ours has! It's evident enough that Mary and I were n't intended for each other! And yet who would have believed, three years ago, that it would have come to this!" And the young man sighed heavily. And then his thoughts drifted off to the time beyond those three years, and he saw Mary Humphreys in all the sweetness and grace which had won him to love her. What a pretty, charming, loving creature she was! half child, half woman! How beautiful she was then! how he used- to worship her! And the old radiant days of their betrothal marched in shin- ing array before his memory, and smiled on him, and then they softly vanished away to make room for one day fairer, standing alone, crowned and glorious, the brightest day of his life. He saw Mary as she was that- day, looking to him like an angel in the silver cloud of her white laces, with the damask roses widening on her soft cheeks, and the sweet quiver of her lips! What a happy bridegroom he was! How radi- ant before them seemedt-o open their future! And with the sweet face of his newly-made wife stand- ing before him, the young merchant closed his eyes   AFTER THREE YEARS.      179 and dropped into a light slumber, and the face fol- lowed him. But now it was farther off, and a great, reproachful sadness seemed to drift up into the dark eyes and over the smiling lips. It was turned toward him, but there seemed an invisi- ble, intangible barrier betwixt them. Mary seemed slowly receding from his gaze, with the reproachful sorrow in her face. He stretched out his arms, and called her in agony to return; but she shook her head mournfully, and the sweet, sorrowful face grew fainter and fainter, and in his alarm and anx- iety the traveler stirred uneasily, and awoke. The white, dazzling level lay before him, and the car wheels were painfully toiling their long way to Philadelphia. But the vision in his dream haunted the soul of Robert Grover, and in his stirred and softened mood he saw many things in a new light. He did not now reproach Mary for her share of the sorrow and bitterness of their wedded life; he took great blame to himself. He saw how in many things he had erred, how he had not been tender, pitiful, gentle to her youth and inexperience, as he should have been. He saw that many times he had been harsh, authoritative, peremptory with her, when explanation and forbearance might have ac- complished all that he desired. He remembered the home from which he had taken her, the loving atmosphere which had surrounded her, the doting fondness which never saw fault or blame in her; and as his roused conscience brought before the   180      AFTER THREE YEARS. man scene after scene in which he had been unkind, or overbearing, or too little thoughtful of his wife's happiness, too little indulgent of her wishes, the heart of Robert Grover smote him, and then it yearned toward his wife as it had not yearned for years, and he solemnly resolved, with the help of God, that his future should not be like his past, that he would do what he could, by gentleness and forbearance, to win back something of the old, lost tenderness, and make their married life somewhat of all their betrothal had promised. He would even acknowledge the wrong which he had done, though it cost him something of a struggle to re- solve on this, and would try and see if he could not prevail upon Mary to join him in his purpose. "I'll find her one of the prettiest dresses in Philadelphia, let it cost what it may!" murmured Robert Grover to himself. And the wind which beat at the window did not make that sudden dampness in his eyes! "Well, every thing's done now!" exclaimed Mrs. Grover to herself, as she entered her parlor, and sat down in a crimson velvet chair, and looked up the long vista of the luxurious room. And as she sat there a strange feeling of soberness and dread came over her. She had' been in a state of inward excitability, though she had controlled herself well during the last several hours, She had packed her trunks so quietly that neither the cook nor the chamber-maid suspected her in-   AFTER THREE YEARS.     ' 181 tended departure, and she had written, with a hand which did not falter, her last letter to her husband, explaining, but without any passionate reproaches, the causes of her departure from his roof, and her conviction, founded gn the unhappy experience of the past three years, that a separation was the only course which would insure the peace of either, and that she was promoting his happiness as much as her own in leaving him. And now there was nothing more for Mrs. Grover to do, except to await the arrival of her brother. She had now no excitement, no outward activity to sustain her; she would only sit still and look straight in the face all the meaning and significance of the step she was about to take. Her gaze wan- dered, with a little touch of regret, about her parlor, as she remembered that in another hour she would be its mistress no longer. Every thing there had a familiar look, and she had taken pride and pleasure in the selection of every piece of furniture. And then she began to wonder what her husband's feelings would be on en- tering the house and finding her absent, and with what sort of emotions he would read the letter on the dressing-table, which would explain all. Would anger or regret predominate in his heart? She was very certain that the possibility of 'her taking such- a step as the one she was resolved on had never occurred to him, although each had some- times threatened to leave the other in moments of   182   '  AFTER THREE YEARS. passion. And Mrs. Grover wondered what course her husband would take in the matter. Would he seek to win her back? If he should come to her, and acknowledge all the great wrong he had done to her, and promise that the future should atone for the past, and she should find, after all, that he really did love her, perhaps--she could not tel-- she might be prevailed on to return to him. But it was not likely that Robert Grover, with all his pride, would do any thing of that kind. Probably he would come home to his lonely dinner with just as good an appetite as ever, and she did not believe that the absence of a face which had sat so long at the head of his table would seriously impair his relish for his coffee and his roast beef. In a little while, too, he would doubtless forget her; and after obtaining a divorce for desertion, he would find some other woman whose charms and graces-- But here Mary Grover sprang suddenly to her feet and put out her hands as though she would avert some blow. She could not understand that sharp pain which pierced her heart; but her thoughts instinct- ively turned away from the path which they were pursuing. Mrs. Grover had deceived herself with those specious sophistries of the heart which always blind our'moral vision. She really believed that she was doing right in- thus leaving her husband, and she had no doubt that he was entirely responsible for all the sorrow and disappointment of their   AFTER THREE 'YEARS.      183 married life, and that to a husband who had been all that her heart craved she would have been the most loving and devoted of wives, going for his sake to prison or to death. Still, as she walked up and down her room-for she did not resume her seat again-her memory crept over the last three years, and for the first time she could recall an oc- casional instance of passion or petulance on her part, of which her conscience would not quite acquit her. She had to admit before that tribunal that she had not always been as forbearing or as thoughtful as was possible; but then Robert had such a stinging, aggravating way of talking that nobody but a saint or an angel could stand it. And yet who could have believed the married life to which she looked forward three years ago with such hope and faith would have ended like this! How fair and sweet 'on the vines of the future blossomed the days of her life, beautiful with youth, fragrant with ten- derness! Alas! alas! for the withered flowers, for the blasted fruits! Alas! alas! for all the hope and joy of Mary Grover's life! "O, if Robert Grover had only been a different man, a better husband, it need never have come to this!"She put her hands up to her eyes, for the tears that blinded them were wrung from her heart, and she could not see, walking up and down her parlor. She dashed the drops aside and sat down, for she was trembling in every limb. She had heard the front door open; her brother had come   184      AFTER THREE YEARS. earlier or the hours had gone faster than she ex- pected. He enters the sitting-room, returns in a moment, crosses the hall; the door opens, and Rob- ert Grover stands in the parlor! Mrs. Grover grew  very white, a little, half- smothered exclamation broke from her lips. "Are you so surprised to see me, Mary?" asked the young man, as he approached his wife. "What makes you look so pale?" "I don't know, Robert," stammered the agitated woman. The merchant sat down by the side of his wife, and looked at her fair face with a new tenderness in his eyes. "The truth'is, Mary, I got troubled about you, and took the morning train for that very reason." "What does it mean?" asked Mary Grover, lift- ing her hand to her forehead, and making this in- quiry more of herself than of her husband, for the woman was half-bewildered. ,He could not suspect half the ground that this question covered; but, interpreting it according to his own knowledge, he supposed that Mary was as- tonished at the unusual tenderness in his manner; and, slipping his arm about her waist, he said: "It means, Mary, that I 've been thinking many wise and tender thoughts of you since I've been away, and" --there was a little pause and a little strug- gle, for it cost the spirit of Robert Grover some- thing to say it, but he did--"I've felt that'I was   AFTER THREE YEARS.      185 harsh and unjust the morning before I left. I was bothered with my business, and did n't know what I was saying. But, Mary, I 've made a -solemn resolution that I will try to be to you somewhat of all that I promised more than three years ago. I mean to be gentle, more tender, forbearing for your sake; and for mine will you not try, my little wife, to be better to me, more forgetful of my faults, less irritating to my temper, and won't this tempt you a little?" He took up a small roll on one side of him, tore open a corner of it, and tossed it into Mary's lap. The torn wrapper discovered an exquisite brocade, the dark-green ground-work scattered with crimson buds.: Mary Grover glanced at it; then she covered her face with her hands, and a great storm of sobs shook her soul to its center. Robert Grover was greatly moved; he knew those tears were not tears of passion or pride, but that they flowed sweet and fresh from a fountain which had long been sealed in the heart of his wife. He drew her to his heart, he soothed her with broken words and tender caresses, and when the sobs grew loud at last, he told of all that had been in his heart and thoughts since he left her. At last Mary lifted her lips softly to his cheek, and he knew  that the kiss which she left there was the seal of a new and better covenant betwixt her and her husband.   Just then the front door opened 16      ,   \186     AFTER THREE YEARS. sharply, rapid feet hurried through the hall, and a loud voice summoned Mary. "Why, that's your brother George! I did n't know that he was in town!" exclaimed Robert Grover. Before Mary could answer, her brother had opened the parlor door. No wonder that he stood -still, his face revealing nothing of his thoughts, except their utter amazement, as he stood still, looking on the two who sat there. Robert Grover rose and -gave his hand to his brother-in-law warmly. "George, old fellow, I'm glad-to see you. Walk in." George responded with his hand, scarcely con- scious of what he was doing, for his eyes were fastened on his sister. "I have n't but ten minutes to stay, for I must take the next train north. Mary, I want to see you a moment." "O, I'll leave, George. I want to get on a dressing-gown," added Robert Grover, good-natur- edly; for he -was too much engrossed with his own feelings to detect any peculiarity in his brother-in- law's manner, and merely supposed that he had some private matter of his own to communicate to his sister. "Now, Mary, I should like to know what all this means?" exclaimed George Humphreys, turn- ing upon his sister as soon as her husband went out and the door closed. "Are you going off as you agreed with me?"      Hi   AFTER THREE YEARS.      187 "No, George; I've seen things in a differenr light." "A pretty affair this is! I never knew the woman yet who held to the same opinion twenty- four hours!" Now, George Humphreys was greatly mistaken here; but men have a singular habit of attributing to the whole of our sex the faults which belong to the particular ones with whom they occupy intimate relations. And then Mary Grover told her astonished, half- skeptical brother of much which had transpired in her interview with her husband, and, taking part of the blame to herself, affirmed her determination to be a better woman and wife in the, future. "It looks odd enough all round," was the young man's comment on her conclusion. "In short, it's beyond my depth; but if you're satisfied, I s'pose I ought to be. Any how, it's time for me to be off, and it seems that I must go without your company." "Dear George"-and Mary put her soft arms about her brother's neck, and kissed him. "You will say good-by to Robert first?" The kiss was warmly returned, and the request complied with. The two young men parted cord- ially, although George Humphreys did mutter to himself as he brushed down the steps: "I wonder if that's always the way with married folks-quar- rel and make up after this fashion! When Ellen-   188      AFTER THREE YEARS. bless her heart!--belongs to me, we'll have a dif- ferent life, I 'll warrant." Mary Grover hurried up stairs with a fear at her heart that her husband might have discovered the letter on the table. But she found it lying there still unopened, and with a little cry of joy she grasped it, and the next moment- it flashed a red torch upon her eyes and dropped its glowing flakes among the red coals in the grate. That night Mary Grover resolved that she would not be outdone in generous confession and acknowl- edgment by her husband; and so, sitting down on an. ottoman at his feet, and leaning her cheek in the old, caressing way on his knee, she told him of the purpose to leave him which had taken possession of her, and whose consummation was only prevented by his return. She did not stop here; she acknowl- edged, with tears of shame and sorrow, her own share in all the wrong of the past, and her resolve to be in future the loyal and the loving wife which her marriage vows implied. And Robert Grover drew his young wife to his heart, and the fond kiss on her lips was the seal of his forgiveness. And kneeling down for the first time together, they prayed for help and strength to enter on their new life with hearts taught by the past, and that each might learn the habit and the joy of self-sacrifice for the sake of the other; and they rose up together better man and woman. And   AFTER THREE YEARS.      189 a new life grew afterward, not without many strug- gles and prayers, not without much weakness, and temptation, and failure, as all human growth and good must; but the true purpose was never lost sight of, the wrong was always acknowledged and repented of, and the blossoms, strung like thick pearls on the vines, promise sweet and fragrant clusters for the coming years- of the life of Mary and Robert Grover.   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN. "AND now, Mark, I want to show you my new pink dress. Is n't it a beauty?" It was just after supper, and I could n't wait to wash up the tea-dishes before I displayed my new purchase to my husband. He had had a hard day's work, building a stone fence around the south pasture lot, which he has concluded to plow up this Spring, and he seated himself by the open window and watched me with his pleased smile as I snapped the cord and tore off the wrappings, and the delicate folds rolled down like a heap of white and pink clouds which I have seen -in Winter just after the sun has got behind the mountain. Mark looked at the fabric with that half-curious, half-incompetent gaze, with which I have often observed men regard some article of feminine apparel upon which they were called to pass judgment. - He took a corner of the calico and rubbed it betwixt his thumb and fore-finger, just as I have seen him try a fresh specimen of grass seed. "It's a pretty thing, Eunice. It pleases me," 190   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.     191 and I knew that Mark Truman meant every word that he said. "It was two shillings a yard," I went on to say. "Rather expensive for poor folks like us; but it's real French, and it'll wash and wear like iron, you know, and it is n't the best economy always to get the cheapest things. Then I wanted something to dress up in afternoons, and pink always was my color, :do n't you remember, Mark?" "To be sure I do. You had on a pink muslin when I saw you for the first time at the picnic, and I have n't forgotten what I thought when I set my eyes on you." "What was it, Mark? do tell me"-shaking out the calico as I held it before me, its snowy ground flushed all over with pink blossoms. "Well," I said to myself, "Mark Truman, that's just the sweetest face you ever laid your eyes on in this world; but I hadn't any idea then that it would one day be the most precious piece of prop- erty a man ever carried in his heart!" "O, Mark, I do believe you are a flatterer!" but I knew the words were not true while I spoke them. He put his strong arms about me and said, "If I was one, Eunice, I should praise you oftener than I do, just for the pleasure of seeing the blushes come and go in your cheeks. They are like the buds on your new dress this mrnute." "I'm so glad you like it, Mark," as I folded up   192   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN. the pattern. "I shall fit it myself next week. It's such a saving to be able to fit one's own dresses, and then aunt Comfort used to say I had a won- derful tact for dress-making." "I wonder what she has n't got a tact for, except for making a good matrimonial bargain!" "What do you mean, Mark?"-laying down the bundle, and looking in his face, for there was just the faintest shadow of doubt as well as of mirth in my husband's tones. "It means, I do n't like, Eunice, to think how much better off you might have been than you are now-a poor, hard-working farmer's wife, obliged to stretch every dollar to the utmost, when you might have been in such different circumstances this very hour." I looked at my husband a moment after he had done speaking. I suppose he is not a handsome man; aunt Comfort said, nobody would ever think of calling him that. I know his face is sun-browned and somewhat weather-beaten; but it all looks good to me, any how, and nobody could search into the deep-gray eyes without finding the kindly expres- sion hidden there; and the open, generous smile that beams over the sun-browned face is kindled away down in the deep, warm heart of Mark Tru- man. "What is the matter, my little girl?" asked my husband, as ^I stood still looking at him, my thoughts full of these things. "Are n't you sorry   THE HEART OF MARE TRUMAN.    193 that Eunice Webber did n't do a little better for herself?" "Are n't you ashamed, Mark Truman, to ask me such a question? As if I wasn't glad every hour of my life to think I 've got a true, good, honest man, whom I could trust away down to the quick and marrow of his heart! And as for the work, I've got a willing spirit and strong hands to make it easy; and all I have to say, this night, Mark Truman, is, that if every wife in this world is as well off as I am, she's reason to thank God and be a happy woman!" "I like to hear you speak--I like to see you look like that, Eunice!" said my husband, as he took my hands in his strong, hard ones, and there beamed a light out of the deep-gray eyes which was like the pleasant May sunshine dropping suddenly upon me. "Well, Mark, you know I mean it all; and I've lived long enough, and had trouble enough, to know that when a- woman gets a good, strong, tender heart to lean on through all her life, she's got the best thing which this world can give her. And I would n't exchange you, Mark Truman, for any man in the whole world, no matter if he would place me in a palace and surround my life with the splendor of a queen." And these words set Mark Truman's heart at rest, for I know that it remembers sometimes its old rival, Rufus Patterson. 17   194   THE HEART OF MAIK TRUMAN. And Mark thinks--which is a great mistake- that I was better fitted for a merchant's wife than -a farmer's; that if I had chosen the former, I need never have soiled my hands with labor; for Rufus Patterson, if he was not rich, was proud and ambi- tious enough to make a lady of his wife. But notwithstanding the merchant's handsome face and smart manners, I knew who had the best, truest heart-yes, I knew! I found the newspaper for Mark, and set about washing up my tea-dishes, for it was growing dark. There was so much warmth and gladness about my heart that evening, that, as I wiped the cups and saucers, and went back and forth from my pantry to the table, I kept humming snatches of old tunes; but that is a habit of mine when I am happy, and I wondered if there was another woman quite so much so, in the whole world, as I, Eunice Webber Truman! I love my little house so--every corner and crevice of it! I go outdoors sometimes and stand on the little grass-plot in-front, and say to myself, "That's all yours; Eunice, every bit of it!" It's a little cottage with white window-blinds and seven small, pleasant, airy rooms. The whole cost just a thousand dollars, and we've paid every dollar of this. Mark /earned half, and there was five hundred came to me when the old homestead was sold after aunt Comfort's death. I furnished the little house myself from garret to   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.     195 cellar, and that cost three hundred more, which I laid by during the two years that I taught the district school. I thank God for my brave, willing heart, that always turns to the light as the leaves and the flowers do. I thank him for my strong, healthful youth; for my happy, happy home; and, above all, I thank him for my dear husband, Mark Truman! He's only been this for three months, though it seems a great while longer-short as the days are, filled with cheese-pressing, and butter-churn- ing, and all the care of housekeeping which has fallen on me;- for, of course, we can't afford to keep a girl; but, dear me! as I tell Mark, one would only be in the way, -and I never was quite so well in my life as now. It's evident that housework agrees with me. Just as I was folding the table-cloth there was a rap at the door, and Paul walked in. My heart bounded, as it always does, with my first glance at the delicate face that grows handsomer every day. "O, dear, why didn't you come an hour earlier? We've had our first dish of strawherries for tea, and I didn't enjoy them half so much, thinking of you!"I exclaimed, as soon as we had exchanged kisses, and Paul had shaken hands with his brother- in-law. "Never mind the berries, sis; I'll take the will for the deed," throwing himself into an arm-chair with a faint smile which suited the weary tones.   196   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN. "Paul, something is the matter with you! What has happened?" He looked up at me a wistful, half-introverted, half-hopeleas look, that went right to the' quick of my heart. I was at his side in a moment, brushing back the thick, crisp locks of hair, with the brown lights adrift among the shadows. "Paul, darling, tell your sister what it is that troubles you!" "Yes, Paul, let us have it!" added Mark, leaning forward on the table. Then it came in a few words. "Uncle Joshua has been angry again. He's -sworn to-night that he'll bind me out to a trade before a week is over." "What kind of a trade, Paul?" "A joiner's." "It's a burning shame! He shall never do it!" I exclaimed, flushing into a great anger, as I looked at the delicate boy in nowise fitted for such labor. "I do n't think he will, for I shall probably run away. It 's pretty hard to go to sea, but it will be getting out of his sight for the next four years." "And out of ours too--0 Paul!" Something trembled over his face which struck the unusual flush out of it. "That is the toughest part of it, Eunice!" he said. "I can't--I won't let you go, Paul!" throwing my arm around him. "Mark, can't you advise- can't you do something to help us?"   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.     197 "Don't get excited, Eunice. Sit down calmly now, and let us first get at the true facts of the case. Go on, Paul." And Paul told us the whole story. Uncle Joshua's conduct was in keeping with his whole course toward the child of his dead brother. It appears that he wants to keep a "chore-boy" in place of Paul, who he has at last discovered is not strong enough for hard farm-work; so he has concluded to bind him out to a trade, and with the hundred dollars which he will receive yearly for his board, he can keep a "raw hand" on the farm. The whole thing was an outrage. Paul's tastes and feelings in the mratter were never once con- sulted; but uncle Joshua disclosed his intentions in his blunt, coarse manner, after supper. Paul was overwhelmed with surprise and indignation, and a good many angry words passed betwixt the uncle and nephew. For once, Paul forgot his uncle's gray hairs and his own youth, and defied him to do his worst, and hurled bitter reproaches against him for all the long wrong and cruelty he had suffered at his hands. The old man was stung into a white heat of passion; he shook his clenched hand in his neph- ew's face, and swore a fearful oath that the boy was in his power, and would be till he was of age, and he would make him feel it too, and do with him just as it suited his pleasure.   198   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN. "And at last I came off and left him in the midst of his rage, and as I turned the corner of the road, and the river lay bright and cool in the distance, my heart ached so that, I wished it was lying still and cold-under the waters, and then there came over me the thought of you, Eunice!" so Paul concluded his story. I was sobbing very hard. Mark was walking up and down the room with a red flush in the center of his brown cheek; at last he spoke. "Paul, you shall not stand this abuse any longer!" "O, Mark, I bless you for those words in the name of that boy's dead father and mother!"I broke down here, for the memory of my mother's last look came over me as she placed her thin hand on his curly head and the whisper went out on her last breath, "Eunice, take care of little Paul!" And she left with Paul her eyes and her smile; and,left more than these-the sensitive, thought- ful spirit, the generous, loving nature, to which coarseness and harshness are exquisite torture. It does not seem seven years since the old pas- tor's voice read over my mother the burial service of those who die in the Lord. Paul was only ten then, and there was no one to take the motherless boy but his dead father's elder brother, Joshua Webber. He is a coarse, stern, harsh man, whose greed of gold has eaten out every better instinct of his nature. His wife is an ignorant, narrow-minded,   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.     199 toilsome woman; and the four boys are like their parents. It cost me many sleepless nights, many -bitter tears, before I could accept the ungracious offer of my uncle, and send his delicate, sensitive nephew into so ungenial an atmosphere. Their natures and Paul's are utterly antipathetic, and each can not comprehend the other. But what could I do? Poor aunt Comfort was an invalid who sadly needed my care, and her small pension could not possibly be expended so as to include another in her expenses. Poor Paul! I have done all that lay in my power to throw some bright colors over the som- ber years of his boyhood, but it's been hard enough. But the truth is, he was "cut out" -made for a scholar; his greatest delight is in books, and it is. amazing, with his small opportunities, that he has taken the stand which he does in his classes. I know the one great hope and aspiration of his life is to obtain an education, and this desire his uncle would only meet with rude contempt and derision. He has always cherished an ill-concealed spite toward Paul, because he was not like his own coarse, sturdy sons, and each year my brother's life has grown more intolerable, and the thought of him, has been the one shadow, darkening over all the joy of my newly-wedded life; for I love the boy committed to my care, with a yearning tender- ness which my lips can never find words to utter.   200   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN. "My darling, my beautiful boy!"I said, and the tears went faster down my cheeks than the broken words did from my lips. "Uncle Joshua will find that his power has come to an end at last. You shall, never go back to him; I will never see you bound out to a trade; he knows you haven't the strength for it." "Quiet, quiet, my little girl; it never does any good to get excited!" broke in the round, cheerful tones of my husband. For once they jarred along my mood. "Well, Mark Truman, if you can stand still, and see Paul abused after this fashion, it's more than- I can." "You sha'n't have to 'stand' it, Eunice; but what I want just now, is to look the matter square in the face, and see what can be done. Now, Paul, speak for yourself. If you had your choice, what sort of a life would you carve out for yourself?" Paul leaned back in his chair, and paused a little. The moon was just opening her white vase of silver through the broken clouds, and the still, sweet light came into the room, and filled it with white calm, and Paul's deep eyes grew luminous, and his face was radiant when he spoke. "What I want, Mark-Eunice, is an education. For this my soul hungers and thirsts night and day; for this I am willing to sacrifice any thing- endure any thing. I feel each day, more and more, the stirring of new faculties, the kindling of new   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.    201 aspirations within me; and they are not young dreams and fancies. I'm willing to work beyond my strength-willing to do any thing-so that beyond I can see the one great hope of my life open up to me-the way to obtain an education." "You shall have it, Paul!"I cried; "you shall have it!" and then a little voice rose up in' my heart, and said--"How?" But Mark's tones reassured me-the calm, steady tones, which always carry hope and conviction with them, falling pleasantly through the stillness. "Well, Paul, we'll think this all over, and see what can be done. *One thing I'm resolved on, you sha' n't go to that trade, though it may be better for you to return to your uncle's to-night, so he will not suspect we've been laying any plans to circumvent him. Be a brave boy, Paul, and trust in God." My brother took hope from my husband's words; so did I. And, after Paul had gone, we sat up a long time, talking over this matter. "It's very evident, Mark," I said, "that Paul was n't cut out for hard work. Not that I think a little tough experience does any one's youth any harm. But you see how it is--he was born to be a scholar." "I see--I see," said Mark, pinching my cheek. "Well, what are we to do about it?" "There's the rub, Eunice. Paul would make but a little better farmer than he would mechanic, and   202   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN. if he comes here, as I am resolved he shall, he ought not to waste several of the brightest years of 'his youth working on the farm." "O, how I wish I was rich!" "What would you do then?" "Send Paul to college." "It's hard to be poor, sometimes, for others' sakes more than our own," said Mark, with the faintest breath of a sigh. "Well, Mark, he must come here and live with us, and work enough to pay for his board; for Paul is very proud, and would not be dependent on any one. Then he can study J here till he can do better." "That strikes me as the best plan just now," said Mark, -getting up and closing the window, for the night was wearing late, and its old illuminated missal, the sky, was shining with a thick engraving of stars. "But uncle, Joshua will never give up Paul so long as he thinks he can make a sixpence out of him. Love of money has made his heart harder than a nether millstone." "I know that, Eunice; but I think I can manage that; and if it comes to the worst, the law will reach him in this matter, for he has no legal claims on his brother's son; none, at least, that can not be set aside." And once more Mark's words gave me courage. The next morning I had gone out to search in   THE HEART OF MARK TRtUMAN.    203 the barn for some fresh eggs. It was a beautiful Summer's morning, but the tender smile of the sky, and the rejoicing of the earth beneath it, could not remove the shadow from my heart; for the thought of Paul lay heavy upon it. After a long search, I found half a dozen eggs, and I sat down a moment, at the foot of a great pile of hay, in one corner of the barn; and I watched the sunbeams quiver and flash, like the golden wings of forest birds, along the old brown rafters of the barn, transforming all their homeliness into strange grace and beauty, just as some good, loving, self- sacrificing deed will transform the homeliest face into beauty and sanctity. -And then my thoughts leaped off to Paul, and to the hard, harsh heart of his uncle, which is just like the old barn, in a dark, rainy day--cold, and bare, and gloomy, with no flicker of sunshine along the blackened rafters, and away off in the dark corners. And then I thought of the hard, toilsome years, which rose up before Mark and me, before we could pay for our farm. Three thousand dollars! It would be long before we could raise that, though. Mark got the land at a great bargain, and there was no doubt but it would be worth six thousand in ten years under his care- ful cultivation; but we can not, with the utmost economy, clear more than a couple of hundred a year from the land, after the interest on the money is paid; and somehow my heart sank terribly, as I   204   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN. thought of Paul, on one hand, with his long craving for knowledge, his sensitive, high-spirited nature, constantly galled, and half crushed by contact with ' his mean and sordid relatives; and on the other hand, I thought of the long path of ceaseless toil and labor which Mark and I must walk together. I don't know when the tears came, but I found them storming down on my hands, and then there came a thought which was like a great shaft of light through the darkness of my soul. I put aside my basket of eggs, and kneeled down there in the old barn, and carried Mark, and Paul, and my own weak, overburdened spirit to the Great Heart which held us all in the chambers of its mighty tender- ness; and when I rose up the bitterness was gone. "Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort." "Eunice! Eunice!" I had not left the barn when the well-known call hurried along the sweet morning air, and I hastened up to the house. Mark met me at the kitchen door. "Why, I'd no idea it was lunch-time yet!" "It isn't, Eunice. I'm half an hour too early; but John's just been to the office, and brought me back this letter for you. It's in such a hurried, business hand, that I thought it might be some- thing important, and hastened home with it." I took the letter from my husband's hand in si- lent wonder. The bold, scrawling characters were   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.     205 entirely strange to me; and even a letter is quite an event in my life, as I have only a couple of oc- casional correspondents in the world. "Break the seal," said my husband, as I threw my sun-bonnet on a chair. I was not long inr doing this, and Mark leaned over me as I read the letter. It informed me, briefly, that Ezra Northrop, my grandmother's brother, on my mother's side, had died suddenly, a month ago, being eighty-five years of age; and that in his will he had bequeathed me a thousand dollars, because I had borne, at his request, the name of his dearly-beloved sister, Eunice Northrop; and the letter was signed by the executor of my uncle's will. "O, Mark, can it really be true?"I said, sinking down into a chair, while the letter shook in my hands. "There's no doubt of it, darling." "God must have sent it to us, Mark." "And we will take it from him most thankfully." "And now you can pay off a third of the farm. O, Mark, what a great burden it will lift off our shoulders!" Mark answered my words with a responsive smile of gladness; and then a second thought came into his face which sobered the smile.  "What is it, Mark?"- "Where's Paaul, Eunice? It isn't fair that we should have all the benefit of this."   206   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN. I had forgotten him for a moment. I think the clock ticked away five minutes before we spoke again; and then looking into each other's eyes, we knew that the same thoughts 'had been busy with both. "Mark, do you think it is best so?"I stam- mered. "If you do, Eunice. We shall have to work harder and longer; but we can do it for Paul's sake." "And this money will set him straight on the way to college?" / "O, yes.; the road will be clear enough then. He can have the interest of this money for the next year, which will pay Parson Adams for fitting him for college; and he can be ready to enter in a year from next Fall. And after he is there, he can teach, you know, in vacations, and manage to get along with what the thousand dollars will do for him; many of the first men in the country have done this." "And who knows but Paul may be a genius, Mark?" "Who klnows, Eunice? At all events, he shall have a chance to prove whether he is." "So he shall. We will make up our minds this hour, Mark, that we shall never touch a dollar of this legacy of my uncle's; Paul shall have it all." So it wasi decided betwixt us; and then Mark concluded we would go over to our uncle's that   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.     207 night, and release him forever from all charge of my brother. "O, what will Paul say when he hears of all this?" "It 'll almost upset his wits. I can sympathize with him, Eunice, in all his youthful hopes and as- pirations, though nature never intended me for a scholar, I suppose." "She intended you for a good, true, noble man, any how, Mark Truman." "It's pleasant to hear such praise from your lips, little lady. But, bustle up, and get my lunch in a hurry, for I must make hay while such a sun as this is in the sky." And, while Mark ate his biscuit and pie, and praised the Spring beer I had made the day before,: I went away back into my childhood, and searched among the closets of my memory for my old uncle, Ezra Northrop. I remembered the white-haired old man came to see us, when my life was slipping off its fifth birthday, and that he had trotted me on his knee, and told me stories of the days when he was a little boy, and his father, who was a corporal in the Revolutionary Army, shouldered his musket and went off to battle; and how he took Ezra in his arms and blessed him; and his mother, who was my great-grandmother, put her arms around her husband's neck, and said: "The God of battles take care of you, Jedediah!" and how the strong man could not speak another   208   THE HEART   I MARK TRUMAN. word, but went out of the gate with a look that his son had carried in his memory through all the years of his life. And Mark listened and laughed, when I told him a moment later, how my great-grandmother paused suddenly in the midst of her sobs, and the tears stood still on her cheeks, and she rushed out of the gate, and a little way down the road, and called to her husband,l'who was just turning the corner of the road by the creek-"Jedediah, you'll find the doughnuts and the apple-pies in the white towel in your right-hand pocket." And Mark brought down his- hand on the table, with a blow that made it ring, and said: "That's just the sort of a wife a man wants- one that will see her husband start out to defend his country, with the blessing of God, and her brave, loving heart; and that won't forget to slip the gingerbread into a corner of his coat pocket at the last minute. A man's rich enough with such a wife, Eunice." And Mark poured out another glass of my beer, and, as he raised it to his lips, said, in his own peculiar way: "All honor and praise to them, for their brave, loving hearts--for their strong faith in God, that never faltered, in the darkest hour of their coun- try's need and peril--for all they did and suffered- for -the old firesides they made so happy-for all their teachings and examples left to us, their chil- dren, and which have mode us the men we are this   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.     209 day. I drink to their memories--the mothers of the Revolution!" Arid, looking on Mark Truman's face, as he set down the glass, I wondered how any one could ever call him a homely man. Just after tea, in the cool of the Summer even- ing, we rode over to uncle Joshua's. My heart was full -of the great joy it was bearing to Paul; but I was a little tremulous and excited, for I feared there might be high words betwixt my husband and my uncle; but when I suggested this to Mark he just said: "Don't you go to getting nervous about that, Eunice. I know the man's weak point and I can manage him." We found uncle Joshua quite alone, for his family happened to be away from home. He sat by his table, with his head bowed over some accounts he was "running up" of the probable gains of the next harvest. He is getting to be an old man, and as he lifted his head and I saw the iron-gray loks. round the hard, harsh, wrinkled face, on which was written the story of his life, a shiver, half of pity, half. of disgust, went over me, I think he divined the object of our visit, for there was a little defiant expression in his eyes, though he shook hands with us and offered us chairs. There was a little indif- ferent conversation betwixt the two men on the weather and the promise of the crops, and then Mark said: 18   210   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN. "I am not a man of many words, Mr. Webber, and so I may as well open the subject of my visit this eveningj at once. You have had our brother with you a number of years now; and as we have a home of our own and want him with us, we have concluded to take him off your hands; and from this night you need never have any farther care of him. I have been in a hurry to have this thing settled, because Paul has told us your intention of apprenticing him to a joiner's trade, for which busi- ness he has no kind of liking; and I think young boys should have some voice in selecting their own following in life, as I believe their bent is to be con- sidered. However, that's not to the point. We 'll take Paul off-your hands from this hour-that's all.?" The old, harsh fac'e flushed into a great heat of anger. "I reckon you'll find," he said, "that it takes two to make a bargain afore you get through; and I do n't intend to give Paul up so easy as that. Il've made up my mind that he shall go to a jiner's trade. What the boy wants is a good toughinin', and to have some of his womanish notions which he got from his mother knocked out of him. I know what's good for him, and I do n't intend to let him go now, after I've had the care and trouble of him for six years." "Look here, Mr. Webber," answered the calm, steadily-poised voice of my husband, "there's no use in getting angry over this matter, and I did n't   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.    2" come here to-night to have any quarrel with you. What I have to state is a few facts, and then I'm done. If you don't choose to give up Paul, that's all; but I know the ground I'm on; and I've had a long talk with a lawyer this afternoon, and I'm certain that you have no legal claim on the boy. His parents never gave you any; and, moreover, he's paid you in hard labor, as I can bring forward plenty of evidence, for every meal he's eaten under your roof. Moreover, there's a piece of woodland in South Meadows, as you know, that you've got rather a shaky title to, as Paul's father could prove if he was alive, and as I shall try to in case you make us any further trouble about your nephew. I don't come here to threaten you, only to state what I know, and I shall put the matter through at once, for I'm a man of my word, and you'd better consider before you decide; for in my mind, if you carry a high hand now, it'll be a pretty ex- pensive piece of business to you before -you get through." Many changes went over the old man's face while my husband was talking. It reddened and paled alternately. There was a little pause, and then uncle Joshua spoke; and his voice was not like his former one. Mark had well said he knew his weak point. "Wall, Mr. Truman, if you're bent on havin' the boy, take him, I say, afore I'll have the bother and plague of a lawsuit at my time of life. He's   212   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN. never earned the salt to his porridge; and as for his bein' any good to me, I shall be better off to be rid of such a lazy dog." The old farmer's voice trembled, and his great brown hands shook with suppressed rage as he fin- ished. But these last words stung me out of si- lence. It had been very hard to bear the sneer with which he had coupled my dead mother's name with Paul's, and the indignation at my heart broke out at last. "What you say is not true, uncle Joshua, and you know it. I charge it on your gray hairs that you have wronged the son of your dead brother! I call God, who will judge you in a little while, to witness the truth of my words, that you took that helpless, orphan boy to your home, and for six years compelled him to work beyond his strength; that you blackened and blighted his helpless youth all that you could, with many cruel words and taunts, because he had not strength to labor as you could; and you did all these things because the love of gold had got possession of you, and eaten into your very soul, and made you a miser instead of a man! And now answer to God as you can for these things; and answer as you can to Paul's father and mother when they meet you with the question, 'Did you 'do well with the child that we left on earth?"' The words came right up from my. heart to my lips, as though some one else spoke them. I could   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.    213 not have stopped sooner than I did. Mark looked at me in utter amazement. As for my uncle, he shook from head to foot, and his face was whiter than his gray hairs. I had spoken solemn facts which no other human being would have dared to utter to him, for every body with whom  he is brought in intimate contact fears him. But now the truth struck home, and his whole life stood out before him in its true colors. It roused all the evil passions within him-it stung him into frenzy. He rose up, every limb shaking, and he opened his white lips twice to speak, and the words died out in his throat; the third time they came. He shook his clenched hand at me with-a fearful oath. His face blazed with wrath. "Begone out of my house!" "Come, Eunice, come!" said my husband, and he took my hand, and the old man glared after us as we walked out of the house. The moonlight lay like a silver lake over the earth, and we saw Paul coming up the road. Sud- denly he caught sight of us and rushed up, his brown eyes full of amazement. "Get in and go home with us, Paul," said Mark. "You'll never cross your uncle's threshold again!" "Mark--Eunice, what does it mean?" asked Paul, staring bewildered from one to the other. "Do n't ask now; jump in, that's all," and Paul followed me, without saying a word, and evidently half believing he was in a dream.   214   THE HEART 'OF MARK TRUMAN. As we started, I leaned my head on Mark's shoulder and burst into tears. "Do n't cry, darling," said my husband. "You've done a good work, a grand work to-night. I did n't know my wife was such an eloquent little preacher before." "'T was n't I, Mark. It was something speaking through me." And Paul's beautiful, pale face lifted to ours still asked, "What does it all mean?" And as we drove home through the black surf -of shadows, and the white foam of moonlight, Mark told Paul all that had transpired during our visit to his uncle's. My brother slipped his hands into mine, and the tears glistened still in the eyes that his mother gave him; then a shadow fell where they shone. "O Mark--Eunice, how can I come to you and be dependent on you!" I answered before Mark could.  "No matter, Paul; we've got all that arranged, but I can't tell you till we get home." It was a still, happy ride the rest of the way, that I shall never forget. We went into the house and sat down in the dear little sitting-room. Then I told Paul of the legacy that had come to me from my uncle Ezra Northrop, and what we had concluded to do with it. And Paul's answer was not for himself, "O Mark -Eunice, I can not, I will not take this from you!"   THE HEART OF MARK TRUMAN.     215 Mark and I had to reason and plead long with the proud boy before we overcame his scruples. At last he threw down his slight, graceful figure on a stool at my feet. "Well, Eunice, if I take this money it shall only be as a loan! I will pay you some day! O, you are the best sister a brother ever had!" "But just think, Paul, you are to realize the one dream of your life; you are to have an education!" He was on his feet in a moment, and. giving him- self up to the great joy of that thought. "It seems too good to be true! O Eunice, from this night my life opens new and glowing before me! I have no more to ask of it." "I have," subjoined Mark, with a covert flash of humor from his eyes. "I want a glass of beer and a slice of loaf cake; come, Eunice!" And that night three happy hearts went- to sleep, blessed of God and at peace with the world, under the small cottage roof wherein Mark Truman was master.     TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. "CHRISTINE, will you go out on the lake this evening? It's a splendid night for a sail." The young lady thus interrogated sat by one of the front chamber windows of a large and handsome country residence. Her feet rested on an ottoman, and she was surveying the; rosettes which mounted a pair of daintily-embroidered slippers, with a lan- guid air and an absent, half-dissatisfied expression. At her brother's question she turned and looked out of the window, and the Summer evening re- vealed its beauty and its glory to the eyes of Chris- tine Jarvys. The house was situated on an eminence which commanded a view of the country for miles around. The moon had just come over the distant mount- ains, and from her urn of- gold was poured out that crystal river of light, whose waves overflowed the landscape, and lent a spiritual grace and beauty to every object which they touched. About a mile off, beyond the meadows, lay, the lake--its silver 19       217   218   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. seam of waters flashing between the green shores, and losing itself in a bend of the mountains. The winds shook out sweet perfumes from the garden beneath; the thick stars over head were blurred by no faintest film of cloud; and so, in its white flowing tunic of moonlight, the Summer evening uncovered its face, and stood up before Christine Jarvys. Her eyes, like harebells, did not brighten much in loving recognition of its beauty. There was a shadow still on the young and sweet face, which she turned to her brother. "I don't feel muohi*. like going out on the water this evening, Asa,"  she said, and the listless tones suited the shadows in her face. "Who is to go besides you?" "O, nobody except Frank Reynolds and Ben Grant to manage the boat. I say, sis, you'd bet- ter go along, instead of. staying here and moping through the evening all alone." And the young man threw his slight, graceful limbs into the chair opposite his sister. "I think that I shall be able to stand it some- how," answered the young lady, with a resigned expression of tone and face which plainly indicated -that she regarded martyrdom as her peculiar des- tiny, and intended to meet her fate with becoming fortitude. Asa Jarvys leaned forward, rested one hand on his sister's knee, and looked in her face. "What's gone wrong now, Christie, that you're   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART.   219 down in the dumps like this? Come, sis, don't act so, but brighten up, and tell a fellow what's to pay." Thus adjured, the young lady condescended to explain the causes which had produced her present gloomy views of human nature and the world in general. "The truth is, Asa, you're a man, and won't un- derstand any thing about it; but my bonnet came home this afternoon, and it's a perfect fright-a great bunch of poppies onr the outside, and purple mignonnette scattered through the inside trim- ming-when purple is so unbecoming; it always made me look hideous." Asa Jarvys was ar generous, good-natured young man--moreover, he loved his pretty sister dearly- so he put on a deeply-sympathetic voice and face, much as a father would over a decapitated plaster of Paris dog, which his child might hold up to him. "Well, it's too bad about the bonnet, Christie, that's a fact." "But that isn't all, Asa. My dress-maker has just sent me word that she forgot the blue trim- mings for my dove-colored silk when she went to the city, and so I sha' n't have it ready to wear to Judge Hamlin's to-morrow evening." "The victim of, a milliner and a mantua-maker! On the whole, Christie, you are an amiable girl, but I do n't suppose that the most exemplary of your sex could stand such a conjunction of trials and  220  TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. sufferings! A ruined bonnet and an unfinished dress! It's too much! I stand appalled before such an abyss of-miseries!" and a loud, hearty laugh concluded, as was most fitting, the mock sympathy of Asa Jarvys's speech. ' But to tell the truth, he commenced it with a benevolent intention of entering fully into -his sis- ter's feelings and disappointments. But his sense of the ludicrous was keen, and his relish of a joke intense, and the latter carried the day. Christine Jarvys drew back with an unusual dis- play of dignity. "I see how it is, Asa; you're making fun of my troubles after all; I do n't want any more of your pretended sympathy." "Well now, sis, it is too bad, really. I'm just as sorry for the little girl as I can be;" leaning for- ward once more and seizing the small wrists. But as though his sister's cup of afflictions was not yet filled to the brim, a jet bracelet, exquisitely mounted with carved ivory, snapped under the young man's -hand. Christine gave a loud shriek, as the beautiful, fragile toy fell to the floor, and scattered the carpet with snowy fragments of dainty workmanship. This was too much. Christine Jarvys fell back in her chair and burst into tears. Her brother felt this was no time for joking, and with real concern on his face he put his arm around his sister. "I'm so sorry, Christie; I wouldn't have done it for all the world, truly. Come now,   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART.   221 kiss me and make up, and you shall have another bracelet, handsomer than this." "I do n't want another," sobbed the petted girl. "Uncle Rufus gave me that on my last birthday, and I wouldn't have had it broken for all the world. I know what your sympathy is good for, and that you are laughing at me all the time." "Look up, and see if I am. Come, sis, don't pout any more.' Forget all about your troubles, and go out and have a sail and a song with me; it's high time we were off." "I can't go with you, Asa; do n't wait for me"- hugging the luxury of her grief. "Well, then, good-by; when I come back, two hours later, I hope I shall find a better-natured little sister," said the young man as he rose up, a little annoyed that his attempts to appease the girl met with no better success. He kissed her fore- head, for her cheeks were hidden in her hands, and then he went out. Christine Jarvys sat still in the moonlight, and listened for- her brother's steps. She heard them go swiftly down the long stone walk, and pause at the front gate while he talked with the gardener. She took her hands from her eyes and looked out, and the silence and beauty of the night reproved her. The better part of her nature rose up, and showed her that she had been unjust and irritable. Despite all the faults of her education, she had fine instincts, and a generous and tender nature. She   222  TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. sprang up and ran down stairs, and out .into the. garden. Her brother had gone some distance down the road, but her voice reached out after,' and found him. "Asa! Asa!" He turned back, at once half suspecting the truth. "Asa," and she put her soft arms about his neck, "Iam sorry I was so cross to you just now, but I was so fretted, you know. 'T isn't any matter about the bracelet;- and. I've come down here to kiss you good-by for two hours." "What! are n't you going with us? Run back and get your bonnet." "I can't, Asa, dear. Mrs. Melvyn sent me a message that she would pass an hour with me this evening, and I promised to be at home. But I hope you 'll have a nice time." She put up a pair of lips that were like'the June roses in the full blush of bloom on the veranda, and her brother bent down his handsome head and kissed them warmly. "Good-by, Christie. Be a good girl, and I shall be back in a couple of hours." And so they parted at the garden gate; and the last chapter of Asa and Christine Jarvys's -life to- gether was closed without sign or warning. Its pages had been made up of the pleasant years of their childhood and youth, and all the lines had been written in light and gladness. But in after   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART.    223 years, those last words- and that last kiss were to the heart of Christine Jarvys like golden blossoms, covering the tendrils of memory, which took their deep root in that last hour of her brother's life. Asa and Christine Jarvys were orphans. They had, however, been adopted by their father's brother and his wife. The gentleman was a wealthy banker in New York, and as he had' no children of his own, he and his wife had lavished their affection on their nephew and niece. No wealth had been spared--no luxury it could purchase forgotten in the training of the young or- phan boy and girl. Their uncle and aunt made earthly idols of the children which had fallen to them, and they grew up with no faint idea of all the sorrow, and trial, and discipline, which are the heritage of the sons and daughters of men. The brother and sister were favorites with all who knew them. The boy, with his dark, thin, finely-cut face and flashing eyes, in which spirit and mirth were forever at strife, was a perfect antithesis to Chris- tine, whose face was the bequest of her mother. Looking on her, at rest, you would have thought of a lily, with its great snowy petals opened full to the sunlight. But the face of Christine Jarvys was not often at rest; it was full of quick change and re- sponse, which set bright carnations in the cheeks; and her eyes, like harebells, kept smiles, as her brother's did laughter; and in light, and in shadow, fell over the soft oval profile the brown hair, whose   EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. rich tints were also the gift of the mother to the child, who could not remember her. Asa had graduated with high honors at college. Christine, two years his junior, was accomplished after her age and social standard. But though her life of ease and luxury had weakened and warped her heart and soul, still the good seed waited in the warm soil for the early and latter rains, which should quicken them into life and blossoming. Mr. and Mrs. Jarvys resided in the city; but as they grew older, their annual visits to watering places became irksome, and they at last purchased i, handsome country house in a picturesque little town in the interior of the State, and thither the family repaired every May. It was a beautiful spot, locked up in rare shrub- beries, with gardens and groves; and as the master and mistress were extremely hospitable, their coun- try home was frequently crowded with company from the city; and so the brother and sister sported and dreamed away the Summer, in the midst of scenery that was a constant picture and poem to the head that could .receive it. Mr. and Mrs. Jarvys had been suddenly sum- moned from home on some business, at the time of which I write, and it chanced that the brother and sister were left alone, as the guests they were ex- pecting, did not arrive till a week later. Christine Jarvys went slowly up to the house in the white moonlight. The shadow had gone off   from her face, and it had now its look like the lily, with the sweetness and the dream of a Summer afternoon resting upon it. She quite forgot her spoiled bonnet, her unfin- ished dress, her broken bracelet. She gathered a few sprays of mignonnette, and some carnations -for flowers flanked either side of the front walk-and then, after a long pause on the front steps, in which she did true and loving reverence to the night, she went into the parlor. A gentleman rose up from the sofa, and informed her that he brought her a message from Mrs. Melvyn. The lady had been surprised that evening by the unexpected advent of her parents, and would not be able to fulfill her en- gagement with Miss Jarvys. The bright eyes of the young heiress searched the speaker's face as he delivered his message. It was a fine one, with a thin delicacy of outline, and a thoughtful, earnest expression, which made you feel at once you were in the presence of a man of force and cultivation. The eyes had a steady brightness, wholly unlike the flash and change of Asa's; and the lips had a smile not frequent nor mirthful, but full of grave sweetness, which matched the eyes. "Will you take a seat, sir?" said Christine, as the gentleman concluded his errand. "Thank you; I fear I shall detain you;" and the young man took his hat, evidently supposing the invitation merely conventional.   226   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. "O, no; I, am quite alone, as my brother has gone out on the lake for an hour or two." The gentleman looked in the girl's face. It was a steady, searching gaze, yet by no means intru- sive. He was satisfied that her invitation was a sincere one. He resumed his seat. "You are a friend of Mrs. Melvyn's, I con- clude?" asked Christine. "My older brother, who is dead, was a friend and classmate of her husband's. I am, for the next. six months, the tutor of her two sons." Somehow  the better instincts of the flattered heiress recognized the true manliness of her guest in the brief, candid answer. - There was no question but the tutor was a gentleman, after the best, truest meaning of the word- a meaning that com-  prehends certain indigenous qualities of heart and soul, which no social grafting can confer. Christine smiled the bright, frank smile, which filled her face with light and sweetness. "Well, I am a woman, you know, and have my legacy of curiosity; but I will not exercise the prerogative of my sex further than to ask you one question more-What is your name?" "Latimer Winthrop. It is known neither in camps nor councils, neither in the world of letters nor on Wall-street; it is famous nowhere; and in the wide world its best merit is, I believe, that it is precious to a very few hearts."   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART.   227 "You are a very strange man," thought Christine Jarvys. Her guest smiled quietly to himself. "Did he guess what I was thinking!" wondered Christine. After this, she could not tell how, they slipped off into an animated conversation on a thousand differ- ent matters. Christine was glad enough to find a man who led her out of herself, and whose speech had some nerve and force in it; who never availed himself of -an opportunity to turn a pretty compli- ment to herself; but who stimulated her own thoughts, who was full of suggestion and apprecia- tion of men, books, and the world in general. At last, in a pause of the conversation, they heard a sudden gasp and cry of the wind outside. "Dear me! what can it mean?" said Christine, and she and her guest rose and hurried to the window. It was a strange sight-the great cloud, coming up from the east, and wrapping in its black gar- ments the golden "stream of stars," and the grace and beauty of the night vanished like the vision of a dream before it. "O, how dreadful!" exclaimed Christine; and she shuddered, standing by the tutor of the young Melvyns. "That depends upon the eyes with which we look at it," said the young man, with his grave, sweet smile, and it was evident that to his eyes the cloud -had no "dreadful" voice or language. This thought came into Christine Jarvys's mind   228   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. as she stood by the window. It was followed by another, which struck all the color from her cheeks. "O, what will become of Asa, if the wind should overtake him?" "(Does -he know how to manage the boat?" asked Mr. Winthrop, with a good deal of interest. "Not in a storm; but Ben Grant, who has charge of the boat, is an old sailor--still, I can't help feeling alarmed." i "I think there is no cause for solicitude; and r.. then there is no thought to calm our fears like the blessed one that God is over us in all danger." Christine's eyes, like harebells, lifted to her guest's, grew full of a strange awe and wonder. Truly this man was unlike any she had ever met. Then the storm broke with a wild cry. The great branches rocked and wrenched under it. It thundered back and forth, and fairly shook the foundations of the great house, where Christine sat with the young tutor, her heart filled with a great fear for her brother. But the storm did not last long. Swift as the wind arose, it fell. The black wings of the cloud dropped- slowly away, and there was a great calm. The stars looked out from a mist thinner than the film of bridal laces. "It is time Asa was here," exclaimed Christine. At that moment the front gate opened sharply; swift steps pelted the stones, and a moment later a youth of about sixteen burst into the parlor. His   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART.   229 coarse, yellow hair hung in draggled locks about his white face; his clothes were dripping, and he stammered out, in an agony of fright and terror- "The boat's gone down! The wind upset her! Won't somebody go to their help?" If you had heard poor Christine shriek then! Mr. Winthrop caught her, or she would have fallen. But there was no time to be lost; he laid the girl on the sofa; and he did not know that his lips ut- tered aloud the prayer which was in his heart, and that Christine had heard it--"God have mercy upon you!" Then the young man rushed out of the room; but his hostess sprang up, and swift as a deer met him at the front door--" O, you will save nmy brother!" she cried, with lips like those out of which never came word nor sound. "God be witness that I shall try!" and he was gone, and the boy followed him. Mr. Winthrop was a fine swimmer; and though the lake was nearly a mile from the residence of Mr. Jarvys, he was only a few minutes in reaching the shore; for his feet seemed scarcely to touch the ground on his way. He paused once only to ask the boy, who had followed but could not keep up with him, a few nec- essary questions. He ascertained that he was the son of the fisherman, Benjamin Grant. His father had been suddenly summoned from home that even- ing, and the two young men had persuaded him to   230   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. go out on the lake with the sail-boat, which he was not accustomed to managing alone. They would, however, have been safe enough if it had not been for the sudden " squall of wind" which overtook them before they could reach the shore; and in attempting to turn the boat around, she upset. The boy swam to shore, and hurried to Mr. Jar- vys's for help, as that gentleman's house was near- est to the lake. He fancied both of the young men could keep their "heads above water" till assist- ance could be procured. And with a prayer that it might be so, Latimer Winthrop rushed toward the shore at the point the boy indicated. The moon sailed out from the frayed edges of the clouds, and looked down upon the fretted waters. In the distance the young man thought he discerned a head sinking and rising in the waters; he plunged in, and was not long in reaching it, and with great difficulty conveyed the nearly-drowned man to the shore. Benjamin Grant had just arrived there. The honest-hearted old man was full of alarm and grief at what had occurred. He looked eagerly in the white, unconscious face which Mr. Winthrop laid down on the sands. "It's Mr. Raymond!" he said. And where was Christine's brother? The small sail-boat was drifting to and fro on the waves, like great silver wings blossoming out of the dark wa-   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS AEART.   231 ters. The two men swam out to it, after consign- ing Mr. Raymond to the care of Benjamin Grant's son. By this time all traces of that wild cloud was wiped off from the face of the sky. The stars and the moon looked down bright and calm on the white faces of the men. They searched for an hour in silence, and then they found him! They drew him up tenderly and laid him in the boat; and as they thought of his sister at home, both the young man and the old one felt that they would gladly lay down their own lives if they could call the breath back to that beautiful clay. The moonlight fell sweetly on them young, dead face, which had in it no traces of pain or struggle, and shone over the sweet, clustering hair which had so lately crowned the proud, restless head. No wonder the strong men wept as they laid it down tenderly in the boat. And Christine? For two slow, slow hours, that seemed longer than all the rest of her life, she had watched and waited. The servants had all gone out, with the exception of a chamber-maid, who tried to comfort her mistress, as she sometimes sank down into stolid despair, and then rose up and wrung her hands, and wandered through the rooms, her wild, white face full of agony. At last her strained ear caught the muffled sound of footsteps outside. They were bringing   232  TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. their burden up the walk. "Carry him in by the side door, and I will go up and try to break the truth to her,"-' said Mr. Winthrop, in a low voice, to the men. But at that -moment a slight figure plunged down the steps and rushed toward the lifeless form. The light, of the moon fell brightly on the dead face. Christine staggered back. "Is he drowned?" she said, looking up in so pitiful a, way that the men could not speak; but she looked in each face, and read her answer there; and then Christine lay on the ground as unconscious as her brother. Latimer Winthrop lifted the girl and carried her into the house. He bathed her temples, and as- sisted the frightened chambermaid to restore her to consciousness; yet he dreaded the time when she should open her eyes; and looking on her as she lay in her fair, sweet beauty before him, he said, stroking the bright hair, "Poor little crushed lily! I wish that I could help you, for the first great storm has come down on your 'life, and how can you meet it-you for whom it has always been sunshine and soft winds?"But the youth in Chris- tine's veins triumphed in a little while, and she opened her eyes. The young man saw that she knew all. She was off from the lounge where she lay, in a moment, and when he would have held her back, she struck aside his arm, and rushing out of the room, seemed led by some instinct to the one where her brother lay. **   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART.   233 She knelt down by him-with her shaking fin- gers she put away the clustering hair from the broad, white brow. "Look up at me; speak to me, darling," she moaned. "You said you'd come back to me in an hour or two, when you kissed me at the garden gate. Your little sister can't live without you, Asa, for she loved you better than her own life! I must have you back again. I must hear your voice call- ing sweetly after me-'Christie! Christie!'-as it used to. I can't believe it's silent forever! O, Asa, my heart will break!-my heart will break! Open your eyes and smile at me once more," and she put down her warm cheek to the cold white one, and shuddered as the chill went through her. She looked up, and Mr. Winthrop was standing by her side. "Can't you help me?" she said, as a lost, frightened child that had sobbed itself into exhaustion would have said it. "My child," answered the young tutor, in a voice husky and broken, "it is qGod only who can help you now." And Christine's broken heart went out, for the first time, with a new call and yearning after Him, whom, in her happiness, she had scarcely remem- bered, but who, she felt in the hour of her great sorrow, from which all human aid shrank appalled and unavailing, could alone give her help or healing. "God have pity upon me!" she sobbed, and then the tears washed in great jets over her face, and 20   234  TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. Mr. Winthrop led her faint steps from the room. Poor Christine! All that night he did. not leave her; and O, what sweet, and strong, and blessed words he said to her--words that fell in healing balsams on her spirits--words of faith, and trust, and submission; and, for the first time, Christine Jarvys's eyes were opened, and she saw something of the Great Eternal Love, whose sea had flowed all about her life; and from the lost earthly love her heart went, as ,so many have done, to the heavenly. And when the first gray flakes of dawn were seen in the east, Christine Jarvys fell asleep, strength- ened and comforted. The next day a telegram brought back Mr. and Mrs. Jarvys to their broken household. There was no one to behold the meeting of the uncle and aunt with the nephew, whose eyes were never more to look upon them, and who had been the pride and the joy of their hearts. He lay there, so lifelike, with something of the old smile coming back to his white lips; but- alas for thy beauty laid low in the morning, Asa Jarvys! II. Two years have passed. It was once more the time of the blossoming of roses, and Christine Jarvys came out of the front door of her country home, and looked once more upon the fair land- scape in its shining wrappers of moonlight. The   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART.   235 bright seam of waters flashed in the distance; the road lay, like a soiled yellow fringe on the dark- green edge of the meadows, and far off stood the great silent hills, reposing in majesty, and the robe of the Summer was woven thick and beautiful upon them. Christine came out from the shadows of the vines which covered the veranda, and leaned against one of the pillars, and the moonlight fell full upon her face. Somehow, those two years had changed it, but the change was that which comes not of years, but of character. Something more thoughtful, more spiritual, had come to the sweet face. The memory' of that night came back to Christine Jarvys as she gazed. "It was just such an evening as this, and right in that white belt of moonlight by the gate you kissed me for the last time-0-, Asal" she murmured. "Miss Christine!"The girl started, for the speaker had entered the grounds by the side gate, and come round to the front steps so lightly, that she had not heard him. Her face flushed into glad surprise, as she gave the speaker her hand, with the cordiality of a long friendship. "I am glad to see you back once more, Mr. Winthrop." "Thank you. The three months since I left have seemed a long time to me, though they've been filled to the brim with hard study. I 've   236  TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. finished my profession, and run up to get yours and the Melvyns' congratulations!" "You would have had mine without the asking." "That is -more than I expected. It is a night wonderful for beauty, Miss Christine." "Wonderful for beauty!"But there was some- thing in the lady's sweet voice which made one think of the tolling of bells. Latimer Winthrop glanced swiftly in her face, and he knew what nigh-ther memory clasped with this one. "I do n't know what I should have done without you -then," said the young girl, drawing a little nearer to -the gentleman, as the old memories surged over her. 'It was not I, Miss Christine; it was God that helped you." "I never could have borne it otherwise. I won- der if I needed that terrible lesson -if without- it my life would always have gone on in the old chan- nels of frivolity and self-seeking, with no real aim, or purpose, or hope!" Looking on the girl as she spoke, a grave, sweet smile-went over the face of Latimer Winthrop, but something flickered along the smile, and up into his eyes, which Christine did not see. He drew  nearer he took her small hand in his own- "Christine," and the speaker's voice had lost a little of its steady poise- "I, must speak what I have to say in few words. That sweet ideal of womanhood which my heart has so long hungered   TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART.   237 after has been revealed to me. I do not believe that I should ever have found it if it had not been for that night two years ago. Christine, you are rich, and I am poor., I have nothing to offer you but a love that has twined itself so closely around the roots of my life, that it seems as though it would be death to tear it away. Yet it would not be, because I trust in God, and he will give me strength to receive your answer, whatever it may be. The Melvyns have told you all about me that there is to tell. A young lawyer, strug- gling up in life, can have little to offer a woman in your position, particularly when his dearest friends have all gone to sleep before him, and he has nothing but his own brave heart and his faith in God to help him. Christine, you know the rest. If your answer must be 'No,' do not let it come from your lips, only take the hand, which I hold here, away."                 i The little, trembling hand lay still in his own, and Latimer Winthrop had his answer. Half an hour later, walking up and down the path swathed in moonlight, he said to her: "But, your uncle and   aunt, Christine! You know what value they place on what I can not give you-wealth and position." The eyes, like harebells, of Christine Jarvys, made answer with her lips: "They will value my heart more than these, when I tell them it is yours, Latimer."   238  TWO EVENINGS, TWO YEARS APART. And so the sorrow and the joy of the two June evenings were blended together in the heart of Christine Jarvys, and ever afterward they lent a tender sacredness and significance each to the other.   "TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME." "COME now, Ralph!" And the lady sprang up with a blush and a frown, and a little flutter of a smile, while the  slipper which she was embroidering dropped to the floor. "Well, hang it! you've no business to look so pretty that a fellow can't help kissing you." And he stood there, with his handsome, saucy face, his bright, amused eyes, his jaunty air, and the half-mischievous, half-penitent look which he had taken on for the occasion. She tried to look serious and dignified, as became a wife of three years' standing. "Cousin Ralph, you forget that we are no longer children, and that it is n't quite proper that you should be so- rude." "It 's a fact, May," gently seating her, and pick- ing up the slipper; "but looking at you sitting there as I came past the window, with your face bent down over your work, and your curls flutter- ing about it, I quite forgot that you were any thing but May Darling, and I Ralph Upham, your boy 239   240   "TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME. lover, who used to tease you from morning till night, and end by loving you better than ever. You have the sweet face that used to laugh, out on me from betwixt the lilac bushes, at the old south window at uncle Jacob's; and I only thought of this when I kissed it." His words had touched some secret chord of memory and feeling--you would have seen that, by the tremulous shadows which went over the sweet face-by the small, faint sigh that fluttered out of the lips, red as a stem of ripe currants. He had seated himself by her side, 6nd had caught the tassels of her dressing-gown, and was swinging'them back and forth while he talked with her. "Those were pleasant times, Ralph;;but perhaps it's as well, now, not to talk of the past." "Why not, pray?  There is nothing, surely, in that fair picture lying away back in the memories of both our hearts, that we should not recall it together." "O, Ralph, you have n't lost your old trick of talking every body into just your way of thinking!" and this time the lady looked up and smiled in her companion's face; but there was a little shadow of doubt and pain in the smile. "And you have n't lost your old face, May Darling, with its childlike, wistful look-the dear, sweet face that was the angel of my boyhood and youth."   "TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME."   241 He was stroking the glossy, golden hair now, with that sort of restless grace with which Ralph Upham always did every thing. A deep flush mounted to the lady's brow. " O, Ralph, you must not talk to me in that way!" and she moved uneasily. "I beg your pardon, -May, but how in the world can I help forgetting, every other minute, that you are the wife of another man! By the by, I want to hear something of this husband of yours. I shall always owe him a grudge for cutting me out; but then he must be 'an incarnation of all excellencies to have found his way into that best room of your little heart." "He is a good, true, noble man; and he would sacrifice his very life to make me happy." She spoke the words out strong and bravely, as though they expressed a settled conviction of her heart. "I am glad to hear it, May. Whatever scape- grace I may have been in times gone by, my heart has always cherished the warmest desires for your happiness." He saw these words had their effect, and con- tinued, after a little pause, "Well, tell me some- thing further about this husband of yours. Is he handsome?" "No; but fine-looking." "The world calls him a most promising young lawyer. Really, May, you can have nothing more 21   242   "TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME." to wish for!" watching her face with his bright, keen eyes. "No-O, no; nothing!" She spoke quick and emphatically, but not ex- actly with enthusiasm. "Well, I'm satisfied now, May, respecting your life-fully, entirely; and I need not tell you how my heart rejoices in this." "You are very kind, Ralph;" and now she looked up and smiled openly and warmly in his face. "I was at Winsted last week. The old place looks just as it used to." This was opening into a great storehouse of old memories and old associations. Mrs. Denison's thoughts instantly leaped forth to grasp them, for she was an impulsive little creature; and she sat by the sitting-room window with her cousin that Summer morning, and talked of her childhood, and walked. amid the scenes which they two had lived together. Her cousin led her adroitly up and down the green, fragrant passages of her youth; he spoke of frolics in the fields, and berryings in the woods, , and sails on the pond. He flashed up before her the old Winter evenings at the brown parsonage, with their crackling birch fires, their piles of nuts and apples. The years of the past were his loom, and like a skillful weaver he shot out of it just what devices and patterns he liked; every word that he uttered brought some new vision before his hearer-opened some window   tTEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME."    243 to the eastward of her life. Nothing was too small or trivial for his notice, from the robin's nest in the great pear-tree, to the swing in the garret, and the ears of small corn which they brought down from the bushel basket under the rafters in the garret, every Winter. And Mrs. Denison drank in every word, and her face kindled, and quick laughs rang out of her lips, almost as sweet as the birds' songs did out of the lilac-trees outside, and were caught and lost in the current of another laugh, stronger and deeper. O, she was a pretty, pretty creature, sitting there with her blue eyes so full of light, her fair, round cheeks kindled into quick flushes, and her glossy, golden curls flickering like lights about her face! May Darling had been the only daughter of a clergyman, who had been for more than thirty years installed over the South Church in the quiet old country town of Winsted. The daisies grew over her mother's grave before she could remember her; and about the large grave clustered a company of small ones, telling the num- ber of her brothers and sisters who were angels in heaven. May was the light of her father's eyes. She was a generous, impulsive, fascinating little creature, and her life was much like the robins', which made their-nests every May in the branches of the pear-tree that grew close to the kitchen door. She had just touched her eighth year when Ralph   244   aTEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME." Upham came to the parsonage. He was three years her senior, one of those off-hand, sparkling, fun- loving boys that are sure to be favorites with every body. He was the son of the minister's oldest sister's first husband, and he was left quite alone in the world when his parents and his step-mother were called away from it. So the kind-hearted clergyman received him into his own family, and he became as a son to him, and as a brother to his child. But Ralph caused his foster-father many hours of anxiety and pain; for, despite all his bright, merry ways, the minister could not fail to discern the lack of truth and fixed principle which, the boy so fre- quently indicated, and without which there is no foundation to build up-a character either perma- nently good or beautiful; and as the boy and girl grew up to man and womanhood, the old pastor watched with vague regret their growing attach- ment to each other. He resolved to send Ralph to college, but he passed all his vacations at the parsonage, and, on his entering on his junior year, May was be- trothed to her cousin with her father's consent. She had blossomed, in that quaint old parsonage, into a rarely-beautiful girl-woman, and she gave to Ralph Upham all the sweet flowing fountains of her woman's faith and tenderness. But a terrible blow  was appointed her, for   "TEMPTED,- BUT NOT OVERCOME."   245 though Ralph Upham  graduated at college with the highest honors of his class, certain facts which transpired during the first year of his professional studies, justified the clergyman in. withdrawing his consent to his daughter's engagement. May yielded to her father's will; but her obe- dience cost her a long and severe illness, from which she had scarcely recovered before her father was gathered to his wife and his children. After- ward May went to reside with an aunt of her mother's in the city, and it was not- strange that her loveliness won her many admirers. Her aunt was, however, a judicious and Christian woman, and softened and nourished by the rains which had fallen into her life, the character of May Darling blossomed into new strength and beauty, and the man who at last won her affections was one to whom her father and mother in heaven would have rejoiced to commit the earthly welfare of their child. May Darling had been for three years the happy and dearly-beloved wife of George Denison, when one afternoon, on coming out of a dry-goods store, where she had been making some purchases, she suddenly stood face to face with Ralph Upham. The meeting was demonstrative on his side, and embarrassed on hers, for May had not looked on that graceful figure, and those rings of bright-brown hair, since she watched them go out of the old par-   246   i TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME." sonage one May morning, seven years ago,- when she was the betrothed wife of Ralph Upham. No wonder she was fluttered and embarrassed when she looked into,that handsome face, that the old memories which he awakened arose and knocked at her heart. Mrs. Denison had known little of Ralph Upham's career subsequent toaf-feir parting, save that he was practicing law at the West. He congratulated her on her marriage, and to her inquiry whether she should respond with like sentiments, he an- swered, half-gayly, "O no, May, I am an ordained old bachelor, you know." But the glance which accompanied the words could not be misinterpreted, and Mrs. Denison knew that Ralph Upham meant her to understand it was for her sake that his heart could never hold another love. He accepted her invitation to call, and the next day-but you know this, reader, Ralph Upham was a skillful reader of human nature, and he was a bad man. Perhaps not ex- actly so, as the world goes, but he was bad- in com- parison with a truly-good and noble ideal. Vanity and selfishness were the great underlying motives of his life. He was impulsive and susceptible, capa- ble of rising into temporary appreciation of all that was good and true in man or woman, but incapable of a noble, persistent life. The stream was corrupt at the fountain, and his was the more dangerous   "TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME."    247 because of his fascinating social qualities. No man was a greater favorite with women, and no mana ever studied their hearts and characters, their hidden lives of emotion and feeling, with more ana- lytical shrewdness than he did. He had conversational powers of no ordinary kind, and as he was sympathetic and reflective, he had a remarkable degree of social pliancy and adaptation; he could be brilliant, tender, gentle- whatever the time and circumstances demanded- and nothing stimulated his vanity so much as the knowledge of his success in awakening an interest in the hearts of women, and wicked and contempt- ible as was this object, it had become a habit and a passion with Ralph Upham. There is no question but something of his better nature had awakened in his interview with Mrs. Denison-for all that was freshest and best in his heart had loved the beautiful girl with whom he had passed his boyhood and youth. But he was resolved to ascertain whether his old power over her was entirely gone, and he was bad and base enough to sit beneath the roof of another man's dwelling, and leave no effort untried to awaken in the soul of his wife those feelings and associations which it could only be wrong to him for her to cherish for one moment. "Is it possible! one o'clock! I have been here three whole hours!" Ralph Upham   glanced at the French clock on   248   "TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME." the mantle, whose silvery voice had just swung through the air. "Where have these three hours gone to?" ex- claimed Mrs. Denison. -"I'd no idea it was eleven!" "Neither had I.  You will pardon me, May, for engrossing so much of your time. They have been pleasant and precious hours to me;" and now he took her hand with the freedom of a brother, and something of the tenderness of a lover, and clasped the soft, white -fingers in his own. "But there is no use; Hmust come back to the hard, barren pres- ent, from the dear old lanes where I have walked to-day with you, May-where we walked together in our youth;" and then, he repeated, as though half to himself, those exquisite verses in Long- fellow's "Gleam of Sunshine:" I' Here runs the highway to the town, There the green lane descends, Through which I walked to Church with thee, O, gentlest of my friends I The shadows of the linden-trees Lay moving on the grass, Between them and the moving boughs, A shadow thou didst pass. Thy dress was like the lilies, And thy heart was pure as they; One of God's holy messengers Did walk with me that day." Then there fell a little silence. Mrs. Denison's golden lashes were dropped low over, her blue eyes, and her companion fancied they were blurred with   "TEMPTED BUT NOT OVERCOME.    249 something which did not let her see clearly the half-finished embroidery in her lap. "We dine at two. You will stay, Ralph?  I want to present you to George." "Thank you. Nothing would afford me greater pleasure; but I have an imperative appointment at that time.- I shall, however, be disengaged at four, and with your permission will call at four, and take you to ride in the suburbs." She looked up, a little doubtful and disturbed. "O, come now, May, you won't hesitate to grant so slight a privilege to one who was for so many years your brother? Say you will go, for the sake of the old rides we used to have." "I think I will go, Ralph." He bent down and kissed her cheek; this time she did not reprove him, but she turned away from the door and listened to his parting steps; and then she sat down, and sobs shook to and fro the delicate figure of May Denison. "Don't, George, you'll tumble my hair," and the lady drew her head back with an impatient move- ment, and .there was a quiver of petulance in her tones. George Denison bent forward, and gazed earnestly in his wife's face; it looked cold and forbidding. "What's the matter, little lady-got the blues?" "Why-what makes you ask?" "Because when a man comes home to dinner he   250   "'TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME." likes to have the smile and kind word that he's always used to." The words touched May Denison, for she was an impulsive little woman; part of the coldness went out of her face as she leaned forward, saying- "Well, excuse me; I was just a little absent-minded, George." At that moment the bell rang for dinner. George Denison was not, socially, a brilliant or fascinating man, but to know his character long and deeply, was to respect and love the man. His affections were singularly warm. and deep, and constant, but his habits were reticent and un- demonstrative, and it was with difficulty he over- came them. But he was a man honorable, generous, noble, with the springs of his poetry and tenderness lying deep and serene in his soul; not flashing up readily to the surface, in all graceful acts and words, but flowing through his .life-still, strong, perpetual currents. He loved his beautiful young wife, as such a man would be apt to, the wonian of his heart's election. "O, guess who's been here to-day?" asked Mrs. Denison suddenly, in a pause of the conversation at dinner; for the little cloud had quite passed out of her face. "I can't, dear. Any body that I should be glad to see?" "I hope so. It was cousin Ralph Upham."   {TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME."   251] The young lawyer put down his knife and fork in his surprise. "What! that old beau of yours?" "Yes." "How long did he stay?" "O! some time. You know we had a good deal to talk about-of our old home and the days when we were children." "Why didn't he remain to dinner, and give me a chance to look at him?" "He had an engagement, or he would have done so. You've never met him!" "Never!" Then there fell a little silence betwixt the hus- band and wife, and, somehow, both felt uncomfort- able, especially the gentleman, who, half-uncon- sciously, linked his wife's manner, on his return home, with this visit of her old friend; for May had acquainted him with her engagement to her cousin. Mrs. Denison opened her lips to speak, and then closed them, while a thought darted through her mind-"{ What is the use of telling George? I can just take my ride with cousin Ralph, and say nothing to him about it "-for she had an intuition that the announcement of the invitation would not be agreeable to her husband. But she put aside the thought the next moment, for she was too honorable for the slightest conceal- ment. "Well, you will probably have an opportunity to a:         /   252   "TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME." meet cousin Ralph at tea, as he invited me to ride out an hour or two with him this afternoon." "And you accepted the invitation?"    i "Certainly. You have no objections?" There was no immediate answer, but May read her husband's face. "O, George, you are not so absurd as to mind my riding out for an hour with my cousin, and the old companion of all my childhood?" "Why do n't you add, also, your old lover?" The blood flashed into the lady's cheek; for the speech wounded and irritated her; and it was one that, -in a better mood, her husband would not have made. "It would not be very wise or delicate for me to. say it before a jealous husband." The Answer stung him. "You can apply what terms you like to me, Mrs. Denison; I simply wish to know if you accepted the invitation?" "Of course I did!"She said it. defiantly, tapping her little feet on the carpet. "Have you any ob- jections to urge?" "No, you will do-as you like; I never laid my commands upon my wife. It is against my prin- ciples." The dinner was finished in silence; George Deni- son sat stern and pale, May flushed and lowering; and the husband rose from the table and went out without so much as bidding his wife good-after- noon. x   tTEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME."    253 "It was outrageous, cruel!" exclaimed Mrs. Den: ison, as she walked up and down the room, slip- ping the rings round her small fingers, while the tears stood still on her cheeks. "To think he was angry because I am going out with cousin Ralph! I shall just have my own way for once. O, dear! if things had only turned out differently!" She did not finish the sentence; she was fairly fright- ened at the angry, repellant feelings which gath- ered gloomily in her heart against her husband. And as Mrs. Denison leaned her head on the marble table, a book which her arm brushed away fell heavily at her feet. She picked it up. It was a small prayer-book, with covers of crimson velvet. The leaves had dropped open, and her eyes fell upon the marriage service, and- those solemn, mys- terious words flashed through her soul-"And live together according to God's holy ordinance." They stilled the storm of passion and pride, of gloom and bitterness, which had gathered in her soul. Mrs. Denison sat down and thought what depth and holiness of meaning- dwelt in those words, and what that sacrament was which set them twain apart, and shut them uip from the world-husband and wife. "And live together according to God's holy ordi- -nance," not simply in word and deed, but in thought, in feeling, in spirit, forbidding all wanderings of the heart, all foolish imaginations, making each to the other tender, pitiful, forgiving, self-sacrificing-   254   "TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME.' just as God, the Father, interpreted those words when, standing at his- altar, she had taken on her soul the vows of her wifehood. There was a long, sharp struggle in Mrs. Deni- son's mind; but she was a Christian woman, and she knew whence strength would come for her weak- ness. "Well, little lady, all ready for your ride?" Ralph Upham asked the question in his pleasant, assured way, as he twisted the cord of his whip round the handle. There was a little pause, and a little flush crept up and settled itself in the sweet face. Then the answer came, low and steadfast--"Ralph, you will have 'to excuse me from riding out with you to- day." "Why, May; is it possible you are not going with me!" surprise, disappointment, and chagrin combining in the tones. "There are reasons, Ralph, and good ones, which I do not consider myself at liberty to mention, which make it best for me to ask you to excuse me." "Can't do it, May," in that graceful, positive, off-hand way that was usually so irresistible with ladies. "I've set my mind on the ride, and now you won't disappoint a poor fellow, will you, that's come two thousand miles for this little bit of enjoy- ment?"   "TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME."   255 It was hard to resist the look which gave the right point and emphasis to these words; but Mrs. Denison did not waver. "Rtalph," she began. But he broke in, taking the soft fingers--"Come now, May, you won't be so absurd or squeamish as to refuse to give me, your brother, this little ride, for the sake of those other long-ago rides that one of us, at least, can never forget?" It was harder still to resist this last tone and look; but if she faltered a moment her voice was steady and earnest as it answered--"I have not declined your invitation, Ralph, without duly con- sidering it, and therefore it can be of no use to urge it." Ralph Upham's handsome face darkened, and his eyes flamed out suddenly. "I see tife drift of all this, May. Your husband is n't willing -to trust his wife with me for an hour. I do hate to have a man set so low a value on himself that he's afraid his wife may fall in love with an old friend, if they happen to be brought together for an hour." Ralph Upham had gone further, and revealed more of his true character in his disappointment and chagrin than he intended, Mrs. Denison lifted her eyes, and confronted her guest with a quiet, steadfast gaze; he would not have known .how much he had stirred her if it had not been for the deep flush which had run into her cheeks. "(Ealph, you forget that George -Denison is my   256   "TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME."  husband, and that you must not speak thus of him, in his own house, to his wife." No man would be likely to after hearing those tones. Ralph Upham was thoroughly crest-fallen; but minds like his are seldom susceptible of real contri- tion, and 'it was with a feeling of petty anger and wounded vanity that he answered: "I beg your pardon, Mrs. Denison; I shall never offend you so again. Good-afternoon;" and he turned toward the. door.  And then the memory of their childhood, and her father's love for Ralph Upham, came over May Denison's soul, and she sprang toward him with outstretched hand. "Ralph, do not let us part in anger. ,Come" back and take tea with us to-night, and you and George shall be friends." "Thank you; I shall leave the city to-night. I wish you all happiness and prosperity, May;" but, somehow, the tones belied the words, and so did the cold, polite touch of his fingers as he bade her good- afternoon. "'What! I did n't expect to find you returned so soon - and alone?" George Denison said these words as he opened the door of the sitting-room, and found his wife seated by the window with her sewing, as sweet and per- fect a little home picture as ever gladdened the heart of a husband; and, somehow, it took away   TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME."   257 half the coldness and bitterness which had been in his heart that afternoon. "Cousin Ralph stayed only a few minutes," an- swered Mrs. Denison. There was a little pause. The young husband did not come forward and kiss his wife, as was his habit. He removed the papers from his pocket and laid them on the table. "Did you- have a pleasant ride?"He asked the question coldly. "I have n't been to ride, George." "Haven't been to ride!"-facing square about nd looking-in her face. "No." "Did n't your friend come for you?" "Yes." "And why did you decline going with him?" She opened her lips to speak, but something shut 'he. words back in her thoughts. Her husband saw it; he came toward her and aid his hand softly on her bright hair. "May, was it for my sake?" his voice was ;carcely above a whisper, and it was not just teady. She bowed her head. The young husband lifted her silently in his ,rms, and sat down in the chair; he held her very lose to him, and he whispered softly: "My own, precious wife!" Then her tears broke out, a quick torrent; but 22   258   "'TEMPTED, BUT NOT OVERCOME." they were tears in which was neither sorrow nor shame-tears of peace and gladness-and they flowed amidst sweet, soothing caresses, that healed whatever of pain was left in May Denison's heart, And at last, when the tears were over, or only hung-in still, bright drops on her lashes, she told her husband all that had been in her heart that day. "Will you forgive me, George?" And his eyes-those deep, beautiful, brown eyes-made full and satisfactory answer s And sitting there they held, afterward,*a long, sincere, loving talk, such as two can have who come out from doubt and darkness into perfect knowledge and peace-and love, which comprehends both the others. And May Denison learned then,- as she never had before, how her husband loved her, and what she was to him. And when, in the bright, serene years of her after wedded life, May Denison looked back upon that day, she blessed God that when she was "tempted" she was not "overcome of evil." O, young wife, reading this story, has it for you, too, neither message nor warning?   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. CHAPTER I. "T'S two cents for foot-passengers." It is very singular, but I hear those tones still; the small, sweet, susceptible voice, winding in and out of the delicate syllables, and I see the little, brown, thin hand which was thrust up at the toll- gate. I was sixteen years old at that time, and I have doubled the years since then; but the little hand is before my eyes now, and the voice, sweet as an old tune, in my ear still. I see the old turn- pike road, too, which I had come upon suddenly, twisting itself like a rumpled brown ribbon along the hills and among the pasture-fields on-either side. "You're rather small to tend toll-gate," I said, as I slipped the money into the child's hand. She looked up, and smiled a smile that was not completed on the lips, but ran up into all the dark, sunburnt features, and did for them what sunlight does for Catawha wine, and emphasized itself in the eyes; which were large, and of a kind of brown or dark agate. 259   260    THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. "O no! I shall be eleven years old next Au- gust"--with an air which said her age ought to prove her a person of good judgment-one who might be trusted in almost any important conjunc- tions or relations. I was amused at her half-childish, half-mature manner, which latter would have sat rather comic- ally upon her if it had not been for her extreme sincerity; and I was about to answer her remark with another, when a wagon drove up with a farmer, who was evidently a neighbor, for he asked in a loud tone after "Mrs. Plummer's rheumatiz," and how the seine was coming on; and the little girl darted into the house, and I kept on my way. On what very small, hidden springs does God turn the great events of our lives! That very morning my grandfather Bryant had shown me a large seal ring which had belonged to his youngest son, my uncle John, who died in his early manhood, smitten by a sudden fever in the East Indies. "It just fits my fore-finger"-as it slid easily over the joint. My grandfather looked at it tenderly. "Poor boy!" he said. "He used to wear it on his little -one." And he shook his fine old gray head. "You had better let me keep it for you a little longer, Bryant; I'm afraid it will slip off your finger." ' Well, let me have it an'hour or two, grandpa." I had my way, as I always did. But a little while later, a fancy seized me to go   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.     261 off into the woods; and I had rambled farther than I had expected, and came out upon the turnpike three miles from my grandfather's.  -  I was passing the Summer at Longwood. My father had conceived a dread that I inherited some- thing of my mother's delicacy of physique, because I had her features, and he had sent me up into the country in hope that fresh, bracing air and daily exercise would counteract any tendency to disease. But the fears were unnecessary in my case; if my mother had given me her face and figure, I had my father's stamina. of constitution. I was his idol. All the love which was not buried in the grave of his girl wife was poured on the head of the child she left him. My father was a very rich man, twenty years my mother's senior, proud, stately, reticent. I had been nursed in luxury and indulgence of the most debilitating kind. I was selfish, exacting, and impulsive, yet, on the whole, a good-natured boy; I made every body's ease or comfort subordinate to my own wishes or whims; but it was a habit with me, and I was  unconscious of it. I was naturally studious, and outdoor life in the woods and fields was a perfect passion with me, and saved me from becoming effeminate. My father had found my mother in the first flush of womanhood at her country home, at Longwood, xwhere he was stopping for a week. People said that her beauty won his heart, but this was not all   262    THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. the truth; her graciousness of soul, the gentleness and beauty -of her life, gained for her what her face never could, with its delicate, sweet outlines, its "gentian eyes," and its marvelous sweetness of ex- pression, which made the face of my mother seem like'the face of an angel. "See here, you must have dropped your ring just after you paid me the money, for I found it on the ground." The little girl panted out the words, breathless with her long run, for I was nearly half a mile from the toll-gate. "So I must"-taking the ring. "Dear me, what a run you have had! How did you know it was mine?" "I saw it on your finger when you paid me. O-h." This last word, which suddenly shut off the rest of her sentence, ran through her lips in a groan, and her forehead contracted with sharp, sud- den pain. "What is'the matter?"I asked, in much con- cer n.  "Why, you see, I stumbled over a stone, and I've hurt my ankle, for it aches." And here the tears forced themselves into the brown eyes. They touched me, for I was very sensitive to suffering. "Come and sit down on the stone fence," I said, for it ran low along the side of the road, and I helped her to it, and sat down beside her. "You're very, very kind to bring me my ring; but I'm sorry you've hurt yourself."   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.     263 "I was in such a hurry, you know." "Does your ankle hurt you?" "O yes, hard!" "It's too bad! What can I do for you?" "Nothing, I guess, thank you." But she winced with the pain as she said the words. aIf you 'll let me-hold you so that you can rest your ankle here on the rail, it'll feel easier." "I 'm afraid I 'm too heavy." "No." I lifted her up gently, for she was a light little creature, and seated her on my knee, and she rested her foot on the rail. "There, now, does n't that feel better?" "Yes, a great deal." Then she looked in my face with her bright, deep, unabashed eyes. "You are very kind to me!" she said. Nobody had ever spoken such words to me be- fore. People had caressed and flattered me, but it was almost the first time in my life that I had ever had the luxury of doing goqd to another. "I think it is you who have been kind to me." And I removed her brown gingham sun-bonnet, and smoothed her hair. Then we fell to talking-and I learned that the little girl's name was Margaret Willoughby; that her father and mother were dead; that she had neither brother nor sister, and lived with her grandmother, who kept the toll-gate, and knit seines for the farmers to go fishing in the Summer.   264     THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. . They were very, very poor folks, indeed, Margaret said, with a sweet, tearnest gravity on her little face; still her grandmother had managed to buy her, that Summer, a strawhonnet, trimmed with white ribbon, and a pink lawn dress, and a pair of morocco shoes; and it was her belief and convic- tion that she looked as nice as the other little girls, when she and grandma went on Sundays to the brown-stone meetin'-house on the green. I drank all this in greedily. It was a new reve- lation of life to me; and the perfect freshness of the child-the entire simplicity and earnestness with which she confided to me her history and. her heart, drew me toward her; and I kept on ques- tioning her further, and watching the quick changes that came and went in her face, with her bright, quick, intelligent answers. At last she rose up hastily, "'O, what will grand- ma say- 'cause I'm gone so!"But with her first step a sudden pain shot through her ankle. "Margaret, you can't, go home alone; I'll walk with you; lean on me:" and I slipped my arm round her waist, and half-carried, half-led the light figure along, so that little weight came on the sprained ankle. "Now, supposing, Margaret," I said, as we moved slowly on, "that you were very rich, and could have every thing you wanted to, what would you do with your money first?" She twisted the strings of her gingham sun-bonnet a few moments, thoughtfully, around her fingers,   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.     265 and then she looked up with a sudden light over her face. "O, I know!" "Well, tell me." "I'd jest have some new dresses, and go to -the academy on the hill; and I'd buy a whole lot of new books to read. You see we have n't but about a dozen at home, and I've read 'em over and over." "I 've got more than you could read in a dozen years, at home; and I'll send you a little library." How her eyes shone and danced! Then she an- swered in her sweet, grave way, "I thank you; more than I can tell, I thank you!" then, after a little pause, "Can you spare so many, though?" "O, yes; I can get more easily enough." She looked up in my face with a searching curi- osity, but she did not speak. "What are you thinking about me, Margaret?" "That you must be rich." "How do you know?" "O, I can tell! I al'ays knows rich folks!" "Do n't you like them?" "Not very often; they're so proud." "Am I proud?" The same searching look into my face; but this time there was a doubt in her eyes. "You look so; but you do n't act so." It was a delicate compliment, and I thanked her for it. We had now reached the toll-gate; and a little 23   266    THEE OLD TURNPIKE 'ROAD. old woman in a white cap and a calico short-gown put her head out of the front door of the little yellow, one-story house that sat close to the gate. i 0O, Maggie, child, I did n't know what had taken you;" and she stopped short on seeing me. "Why, grandma, I had to run a long ways be- fore I could get to him with the ring, and I've sprained my ankle, and he had to come home with me." "Dear me!" said the old woman, inspecting me with her dim eyes, on this informal introduction- "I'm sorry she's made you so much trouble." "It's of no consequence whatever, ma'am, only I think her ankle may require immediate care." The old lady invited me to walk in, and her granddaughter indorsed the invitation with her eyes. But the long Summer day was leaning toward the night, and I had a walk of three miles before me; so I declined the invitation, but promised to accept it during the week; and I took leave of the old lady and the little girl, and went up the old turn- pike road, laying plans to serve my new acquaint- ance, and musing on all she had told me; and the voices of the coming evening began to wake up prophetically in the woods, but no voice whispered to my soul that God had sent his angel to walk with me that day! On reaching home I learned that a letter had been received from my father, stating that his busi- ness required his going abroad immediately, and   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.     267 that he had concluded to have me accompany him, as the time of his return was somewhat indefinite, and I could pursue my studies in Europe as well as in America. I was to leave my grandfather's the next day. I have quite often wondered that in the midst of the interest and excitement which this news occa- sioned, the little girl at the toll-gate did not quite escape my mind; but she did not. I had a private interview with my grandfather, and related to him the history of my meeting with Margaret Wil- loughby, and succeeded in awakening the old gen- tleman's interest in my little protege, and obtaining his promise that he would send her for two years to the academy on the hill. The four days which intervened before our de- parture were occupied with the hurry and bustle of preparation; but I managed to find time to prepare a large box of books, of a miscellaneous kind, poems, histories, stories, etc., which were duly sent to my grandfather's care, for the little girl at the toll-gate. CHAPTER      II. "COME, Bryant, put your book down, and hold this skein of silk for me, please." She said the words in her pretty, half-peremp- tory, half-coaxing way, as she came toward the   268-    THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. lounge where I was lying close by the open window, reading, alternately, the page of that beautiful Spring day, and the page of the book which I held in my hand. One, somehow, seemed to-harmonize and fit into the other. The face of the late May, looking down on the Summer, had caught the glory and the glad- ness thereof; the fruit-trees were puffed and fluted with blossoms, and full of the song of birds; the dozing winds breathed sweet fragrances into the window, and the sky wore the bright, radiant smile of the -completed Spring upon its face, And the book which I -was reading wore a smile, too, upon its face-the smile of one whose hope and whose trust were in 1the love of our Father who is in heaven. The volume was a collection of miscellaneous stories and poems, and the unknown writer was evidently a woman, and in her youth. There was a glow and freshness about- her genius which could only belong to the May of life. There was a little throb of sadness, too, running through the pages, which touched,-with the ir soft, healing, wondrous skill, the loves and the sorrows of human life. Much the writer had rejoiced; somewhat she had suffered; but the sunshine and the rains had alike nourished the sweet, gentle, loving womanhood which warmed and sanctified the pages. I thought all this before Annie, the wife of my cousin Fred- erick Mathers, came to my lounge, and kneeled down   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.      269 by it, with a skein of silk slipped around her dainty fingers. She had a kind of passion for crocheting and embroidering, and for all those nicknacks with which women are forever busying themselves. Annie was a bright, merry, good-hearted little thing; no great depth or force to her, to be sure; but she was just such a wife as Fred needed--full of domestic tact and taste, very pretty and graceful withal. So she gratified him aesthetically, for he was naturally fastidious. Twelve years lay between this Spring and the last one I had passed at Longwood. They had brought many changes Ito me, as they usually do to all lives. My grandfather had laid his gray head under the grasses six years before, and a sudden fit of apoplexy had stricken my father just as he was on the eve of returning to America, three years be- fore. One  night, twelve months later, while I was traveling through the south of England, that great and terrible misfortune befell me, which swept out, for a time, all my hope and desire in life. The bridge over which our cars were 'passing broke down; many of the passengers were hurled over a  precipice into the river, a hundred feet below. I was thrown  upon a part of the bridge which re- mained, and I remembered nothing more. A long, slow illness followed. I was internally injured, my ankle broken, and I found myself a cripple for life- I believed then, a confirmed invalid. I returned to   270    THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. America a year later, somewhat improved in health, but still physically a wreck of what I had been. Frederick Mathers, my only cousin on my father's side, had been my most intimate companion and friend during my boyhood; and we had kept up an intermittent correspondence during my residence abroad; for I had graduated at a German univers- ity. Frederick was a young physician; he had married six years before, and was succeeding well in his profession. But he was still poor, while I was the only heir to my father's wealth. I easily persuaded my cousin to go to Longwood, and take up his residence in the gray old stone house which my grandfather had built. Wbe had the interior a little rejuvenated and modernized, without seriously altering its old-fashioned physi- ognomy-for I am   no iconoclast. Early in the preceding March we had settled down here. It was the only spot on earth which was home to me. Fred and Annie were enchanted with their new residence, and we daily congratulated each other on the success of our project. "Bryant," Annie began, in her light, quick way, while the silk ran in a crimson ripple over her rapid fingers-"I think it's high time you were waked up. You've just done nothing but settle down here over your books, ever since we got snugly under this blessed old roof. Fred says you ought to pass two-thirds of your days under the trees, from this time to November."   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.    2 71 "You must n't make it so pleasant in the house, then, that a fellow can't- muster up courage to get out of it." "Well, if that's all that's wanted to get you out, I assure you nothing shall be left undone on my part," with a comical dip of her bright head, and an arch laugh running out of her blue eyes. "And accomplish it, no doubt, because you are a woman; but, Annie, if you get me outdoors, it wouldn't be far or long;" and I glanced at the, crutch which stood at the foot of the lounge. A little sadness crept across the brightness of her face; "O, yes you will, Bryant;" but the sentence was broken into by an urgent summons from some neighbor, which at once took Annie down stairs. I lay still, amidst the bright sunshine and the dozing winds, but, for a while, the thoughts which came over my soul were like those cold mists which sail in from the north-east, and cover the face of the earth every November. I thought of my bright, careless, affluent youth; of my proud, strong manhood, all crushed out of me in an hour; of the broken dreams, and health, and hope; of the slow life, and the crippled limb that I must carry to the grave; and I laid 'my head back with a slow, weary heart-ache, and almost longed to die. And with that last thought a new light and warmth came through the mist, and glorified it. Whatsoever my life was, my death would be better   272     THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. for the evil that had befallen' me. Had I not learned in that long, wasting sickness, patience and submission, love to God and to man? "Uncle, uncle Bryant, see what I've got for you!" A slender thread of sound came through the open door, and there was the soft patter of a child's feet in the room, and a little head with clusters of shin- ing curls, and pretty red lips, that were always full of the motion of talk and laughter, came up to me, and a little hand, that was like a sea-shell, held up triumphantly before my eyes a cluster of white roses. Large, queenly, luscious flowers they were, their snowy blossoms, full of heavy, passionate fra- grance, as they lay half-sheltered in a covert of green leaves. "O, Barry, my pet, where did you get these beautiful roses?" "Miss Willoughby gave them to me," lisped the voice of six Summers. "And who is Miss Willoughby?" "She's my school-teacher, you see; and I went home with her to-day, and when I saw the flowers growing all round the front window, I spoke right out, 'O how  uncle Bryant would like some of them!' And Miss Willoughby smiled, and said, 'Would he, dear?' And then she gave me these; but I knew she meant 'em for you, though she did n't say so." "What do you know about this Miss Willoughby,   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.     273 Annie?"I asked of Harry's mother, when she re- turned to my room. "Very little; I've seen her but once. She struck me as a quiet, lady-like person, a little over twenty; and, altogether, her manner pleased me. She teaches the district school, and I sent Harry to her, just to get the little rogue out of the way for a few hours. I remember, now, that Mrs. Peekham. told me the school-teacher's name is Margaret Wil- loughby, that she writes poetry occasionally, and supports her grandmother, who is an infirm and very old woman." "Margaret Willoughby! Margaret Willoughby!" The name seemed to go in slow, silver, liquid echoes up and down my thoughts, as though it came from some far country in the past, and wound through all the years, and called to me, soft and faintly, "Mar- garet Willoughby!" "That's it!"I brought my hand down suddenly, and with no little emphasis, on the table. "What's it?" cried Annie, half-springing from her seat with the start I had given her. "Something I've found in my thoughts." "Bryant, you are the oddest man alive," an- swered Annie, and a laugh ran out of her lips as she wound Harry's silken curls around her fingers. And I sat there opening and shutting my eyes, and thinking of that far-off day when I first met Mar- garet Willoughby. I could see it still-the old turnpike road, wind-   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. ing away like a brown, crumpled ribbon through the green pastures, on either side, and the little girl at the toll-gate, with her small, tanned face and strange, bright eyes. I had not thought of it for years; but it all came back now, vivid as a thing of yesterday, and I recalled now a letter which my grandfather had written during my first year in Germany, in which he mentioned Margaret Wil- loughby, stating that he had sent her to the academy, and that she was a remarkably-intelli- gent child, and he was much interested in her. And that little girl had blossomed into woman- hood, and taught school, and wrote poetry now! and she had not forgotten, I had evidence of that in the roses that were like great snowy goblets pouring out delicious fragrance in the tall Venetian glass on the table. I kept my own counsel, but I resolved that not many days should go over my head before I looked on the face of Margaret Willoughby. CHAPTER III. "GRANDMA, we shall have strawberries and cream by week after next. I've been out among the vines, and they're doing finely." The voice fluttered out of the front window of the dainty little white cottage, as I stood at the   I   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.      275   gate that June morning. The house looked in the distance like a little white cup hidden among the trees. It couldn't have contained more than five rooms. It was picturesque enough, though, all hug- ged round with woodbines; and on either side of the grass-plat was a bed of flowers with a fringe of box. The next moment she came to the window, where her voice had just preceded her, and she shook out a table-cover of red and black, in that quick, skill- ful way which made one feel at once that her hands were used to all that kind of work. She did not see me, but I had a good view of her face. It was a strange, contradictory one; for the eyes, of a large, deep brown, had the look of a child-the look I remembered, full of wonder and wistfulness, with endless smiles and variations in them; but there was a certain gravity about the mouth, and a sweet seriousness about all the oval features, which thought, and discipline, and sorrow could alone have given them. It was not a handsome, pretty, beautiful face; but there was a charm about it. So I watched her as she arranged the books on the table, wiping off the dust with a small cloth, and humming snatches of old tunes, or replying to some question of her grandmother's, who must have been in another room, and probably a little deaf. At last I went up to the house, and she came to the door with a face full of surprise. She did not recognize me.   276     THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. "Miss Willoughby," I said, offering her my hand, "I have come to thank you for the roses you sent me by your little pupil, Harry Mathers, the other day." What a leap of surprise, recognition, pleasure, and timidity there was in her face! Then she put her hands, her little, soft, warm hands in mine, and said, just as she would have said- it thirteen years before, on the old turnpike-"I am very glad to' see you, Mr. Hamilton." I went into the parlor and sat down. It was the neatest, plainest, cosiest little spot imaginable. There was a dark, ingrain carpet, and cane-seat chairs, green lounge, and a little table covered with books. We sat down on the lounge. I saw her glance at my crutch and my crippled limb, and such a sweet sadness came into her eyes as I have seen in children's when their mothers' faces were sorrowful. "I thought it most likely you had forgotten us," she said. "O, no. I remember the old turnpike road, and the toll-gate, and the little girl with the sprained ankle." A smile ran into her lips and then over her face; but I knew a word more would have brought some- thing into her eyes besides a smile, so I said/ quietly, "Did you get the books I sent you?" She answered my question indirectly: "If you could have seen me the day they came, or have   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.     2" known the marvelous treasures which they opened up to me; if I could tell you of the new life which they nourished in my soul!"-she stopped here abruptly, but her face finished the sentence as even her voice could not have done. After this I have no remembrance of what we talked about, but there were few pauses in the con- versation, and I remained three hours. Margaret Willoughby - was a new revelation to me; for, be it remembered, I have met with the noblest born and highest bred, the loveliest and most gifted women of both hemispheres; and I had learned what it takes so many near a lifetime to learn-- that no grace of mien, no gift of mind or person, no outward adorning can make a lady; I mean that sweetness and gentleness, that tender- ness and sympathy which Luther meant when he said, "The heart of a Christian woman is the sweet- est thing this side of heaven." And Margaret Willoughby was this-a lady by the will of God! I knew it during that morning that we passed to- gether-for school had a week's vacation. We rambled over many subjects, and, though I can not recall these, I remember perfectly the im- pression which Margaret Willoughby's conversation left on me. What struck me at first most promi- nently was a kind of childish artlessness which wound its golden thread through her whole speech and manner; yet it was tempered with a sweet, womanly gravity, and dignity, and thoughtfulness,   278     THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. just as the expression in her eyes was by the rest of her face. Perhaps somewhat of this was owing to her small knowledge of the world; for she told me she had never been thirty miles from Lonigwood in her life. But she had read, studied, lived; and so she had bloomed into her young, sweet, fragrant womanhood like the white roses she had plucked for me. I saw the young school-teachervery often after this; for as the Summer grew, I gained strength of body and soul, and we had frequent rides together; and there was a little fringe of woods back of the small white cottage where we used to go, and sit, and listen to the brook, whose silver waters tangled themselves with gurgling leap and laughter over the stones; and -Margaret was never weary of listening, with those bright child-eyes and that womanly face of hers, to the stories I had to tell her of foreign countries. She had read much and -seen little, and this always gives to a woman a kind of strange, contradictory air and manner. She had something, too, to tell me of her life; of its strug- gles and aspirations, and how, after she had at- tended the village academy five years, she was offered the situation of village school-teacher, and since then her grandmother's increasing age and infirmities had rendered her unfit for any active cares- or duties. I looked at the small trembling figure, and wondered at the brave, true, strong soul which it held.   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.     279 "I shall leave you here to take care of your- selves with a great many doubts and misgivings, but there's no help for it," said cousin Annie, as we all gathered in the sitting-room after tea, one evening just in the opening of September. She had been summoned to the bedside of her mother, who was ill--not dangerously so; but in that state of mingled nervous excitement and prostration which required her daughter's care and society, and Fred- erick had given his wife "leave of absence" for a month. We all felt sad enough at the thought of missing Annie's bright face and cheery voice about the house, and I knew the lightness of her tones was assumed to hide something deeper in her voice, as she pushed an ottoman to her husband's feet, and, throwing herself on this, rested her cheek on his knee, while Harry perched himself on the other. "I expect Bryant and I 'll make awkward work, keeping old bachelor's hall," laughed the young husband, as he smoothed the yellow silken hair that lay in its abundant beauty on his knee. "Our case looks dubious, Fred. We shall have nobody to scold us for not being punctual at dinner, or keeping the rooms in disorder-in short, for committing any of these numerous delinquencies by which the sons of Adam have managed to keep the tongues and tempers of the daughters of Eve in a constant state of excitement during the last six thousand years."   280    THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. Annie lifted her head, and shook with playful threatening her white hand in my face. "Bryant," she -said, "I wish you would take one of those daughters of Eve you've just maligned so to wife before the next twenty-four hours goes over your head." "Thank you for your benevolent wishes. If I could only find her now!" Here Harry slipped off his father's knee, and pattered up to me, and put his pretty face close to my ear. "Uncle Bryant," he said, confidentially and earnestly, "I know of somebody you could get to be your wife." "Who is it, my pet?" "Miss Margaret Willoughby." How his father leaned his head back and laughed, while his mother clapped her hands and shouted! "But how 'do you know she'll have me, my boy?"- lifting the little fellow on my knee. He nestled his head on my shoulder. "I'll ask her to-morrow, and see." Another peal of mirth-Annie's sweet laughter tangling in and out of her husband's. "No, thank you, Harry; I prefer to 'speak for myself' on such a subject, or I fear that I should meet with no better success than Miles Standish did with the Puritan maiden, Priscilla." "And probably uncle Bryant will select a some- what different 'maiden' from your school-teacher, Harry, when he does speak for himself."   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.     281 "How do you mean, Annie?'" "Why, I mean different in position, family, for- tune, every thing. Do you know, Bryant, M1rs. Peekham was wondering this afternoon that you could visit Miss Willoughby so often. She says she has never had any position in Longwood, that she 's low-bred, and her grandmother kept the toll-gate!" "And what did you tell her, Annie?" "O, I told her that I knew nothing about Miss Willoughby, having never met her but once, only she was- a little proteg# of yours once, though I knew you had no serious intentions in- that quarter." "HJfow did you know it?" She turned and 'faced me. "Why, Bryant, you have n't, have you?" "It has just struck me that I have." "Well, that's cool, old fellow!"It was Fred in- terposed here, not knowing exactly how to take me. "Now, Bryant, are you in sober earnest?" asked Annie, coming over to me. "Yes; I think I shall take Harry's advice, and ask Miss Willoughby to be my wife." ' "O, Bryant, what will Mrs. Peekham-what will the world say?" "Do you think I should stop to inquire, Annie Mathers? Do you think when I found a woman whose "soul was crowned with those rare and beau- tiful jewels above all price, which make a loving and Christian womanhood-do you think I would not gather her to my heart sooner than a crowned 24   282    THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. queen, and holding her there--its joy, and light, and completeness--do you think I should care what Mrs. Peekham or the world said of it?" "No, I wouldn't if I were you, Bryant!" out spoke Annie; for her heart was full of noble and generous impulses that responded quickly to the right touch. "No! a thousand times no!" answered the deep, emphatic tones of her husband. And then I told them a little of all Margaret Willoughby had been to me, how, unconsciously, the knowledge and the love of her had wakened my life into true and higher purpose; and how her sweet, childlike faith had called-to mine, which lay cold and dormant in my soul; and how the great sorrow of my life had taught me, at last, a new submission to the will of God, our Father; and how I, who once longed to die, was now willing and re- joiced to live for his sake. And when I concluded my cousins came and placed their hands in mine, and said, "Bryant, may you be very happy with the wife of your choosing!" I went up toward evening to the little white cot- tage set like a cup among the trees. Margaret was sprinkling a moss rose bush, in the front yard, with a small watering-pot. She came toward me, her brown eyes full of their shy smiles, and the soft flush going in and out of her face. She wore a-lawn dress, with sprigs of pink scattered over the white ground, and the sleeves were looped back from the   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.     283 small, white arms. We talked awhile of the sunset ,clouds, of the flowers in the yard, of the farewell of the Summer, and then I said to her, "I have a book, Miss Margaret, and out of its sweet, fresh, perfuming pages I have selected a little sketch which, with your permission, I shall read to you." "Thank you;" and we went into the parlor to- gether. But when I drew the book from my pocket, she glanced at it and said, with a sudden drawing in of her breath, "O, is that the book?" "You have seen it, then?" "I have heard of it;" and she turned away, and seemed very intent on smoothing the folds of her dress. The book was the one which I had read that day that she had given Harry the roses. It struck me that her manner was a little sin- gular, but I sat down and opened the book, and she sat a little way from me, and listened to my read- ing. She sat, as I said, a little apart from me, her hands lying still in her lap, except when the little fingers fluttered restlessly against each other--for they had a kind of habit of motion. The sketch was a very brief one-a little, exquisite, pathetic picture of a country home, and hearts made very heavy with the anguish of misapprehension and parting, and glad unspeakably with the sudden joy of meeting and reconciliation. "Isn't it a touching little thing?"I asked, as I closed.   284'    THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD. "I--do you like it so much?" and her face was radiant. "Yes- do n't you?" She opened her lips--her blushes came and went-suddenly it flashed across me- "Margaret, you wrote this book!" She tried to look astonished, but she was not used to dissemble. She buried her face in her, hands, and broke into sobs. "Margaret, dear Margaret, have I no right to your secret--the right of one who would be nei- ther friend nor brother, but more and better than these?" She understood me, but only sobs kept swaying back and forth the small, slender figure. Once, and once only, I tried her. "Margaret, you do not answer me. Is it because you can not love a man who is crippled for life? whose health can never be"- Her face sprang up from her hands. The tears were held in check upon it. "O, Mr. Hamilton, you do not think so meanly of me as that!"' and I was answered. Then, for the first time, I gathered her to my heart, and kissed the red blossom of her lips, and. thanked God that she belonged to me for life; that she would walk by my side, true, tender, sweet, loving till death took us apart-my wife, in the best and holiest meaning of that blessed word.   THE OLD TURNPIKE ROAD.     285 Two years she has been this--two years which have taught me how priceless was the pearl I found on the old turnpike road--the pearl that I found, and wore on my heart-Margaret Wil- loughby.   t': I a rr   ONE MAN'S WORK. "I THOUGHT I heard you call to me," said the gentleman, turning back. "O no-no-I-you are mistaken, sir!" an- swered the lady, in a fluttered, half-coherent man- ner, as she stood in her front door. The gentleman lifted his hat with a grave courtesy, which indicated that he was not on famil- 'iar terms with the lady; she. bowed, and as he turned, still a little irresolutely, the front door closed, and there was no more to be done or said. And yet this man, Cleveland King, did not feel quite assured by the lady's answer, as he went with his firm, rapid step down the broad pavement, with the row of gas-lights making a long golden perspec- tive on his right hand. His hearing could not have deceived him. The lady whom he had just left at her residence, had certainly called to him, and the voice was one of involuntary terror, bewilderment, appeal, such as one might make in the depths of a dark forest, or on the verge of some beetling preci- pice, to which they had wandered, to find the sands crumbling under them. The voice haunted Cleve- 287   288      ONE MAN'S WORK. land King, as he kept on his way to his sister's, at whose house he had promised to pass the night, for her husband had left town for a few days on busi- ness. Cleveland King was not a man to shut out 'from his thoughts any call of helplessness or suffer- ing, and this one somehow went beyond his thoughts into his heart, and troubled it. And yet, what could he do, and what did it mean? Of the lady, Mrs. Northam, he knew very little. He had not met-her more than twice before the present evening; for Cleveland King was very far from a man of society. The lady's face had struck him the first time he saw it; it was a fine, delicate, sweet face, without much glow or bloom about it, but one that, in any crowd, would have attracted and impressed you. It was a young face too, so young that Cleveland King was surprised to learn that the lady was married. Afterward he had met her riding out with her husband, a man whose life could not lie far on the hither side of fifty, a hard, pompous, purse-proud man, as Cleve- land read in the first glance at his face, and he had thought to himself, as the two rolled past him in their luxurious carriage, behind their magnificent bays-"That woman can't be happy with that coarse, hard man. Her face shows she has fine enough intuitions to repel him. It's another mat- rimonial bargain-money on one side, grace and beauty on the other; and ambitious and heartless relations to manage the whole thing."   ONE MAN 'S WORE.      289 Cleveland King was a man of keen observation, of fine, generous nature. He was young still, al- though by his own talents he had made a consider- able fortune, and was now silent partner in an old, wealthy house; but he was among the very few men into whose soul the greed and the lust of gold had not entered. He had settled in his soul just how much and how little it could do for him;. and he resolved that the ambition- of his life should not be to become a millionaire. He was only a little way among his thirties; he resolved to indulge his natural tastes for reading and study, of which his previous business life had afforded him but little opportunity; so he withdrew from comparatively-active life in the house where he had passed his youth. His partners ridiculed and remonstrated, but he was not a man to be easily swerved from an object on which he had set his mind. "It's a shame!" they said to him. "You might be one of the richest men in the city in ten years." "Exactly, but I want to be something more than a rich man when I die." The old gentlemen opened their eyes. It was a new philosophy for the house on Wall-street. And so, Cleveland King reached the house of his sister, with the fair face of the lady he had left standing before him all the way, just as she stood in the front door, with that sudden look of anguish, doubt, and terror leaping out of it, just as the cry 25   290      .ONE MAN'S WORK. did out of her voice. He had seen it for a moment as he turned back when that cry reached him. "Perhaps I'll mention it to Julia," thought the young man, as he rang the door-bell of his sister's stately dwelling. "Why, Cleveland, I couldn't think what had kept you out so late!" said Mrs. Gresham, as her brother entered the sitting-room, where she was awaiting him a-little impatiently. They were as unlike in person as in character- this brother and sister; and yet it was natural they should be fond of each other, as they were the only living members of their family. Mrs. Julia Gresham was a couple of years older than her brother, a tall, dark, stylish woman; a practical, ambitious, worldly-wise one; a woman whose creed was founded on real, substantial, exter- nal good. She believed in, she reverenced wealth, position, prosperity. She had married a rich and highly-respectable gentleman, who proved himself a somewhat dull, but good-natured, indulgent hus- band; and they lived in very handsome style, and had charming receptions, and moved in the best society; for in these things consisted the life-after all, the paltry, barren, worldly life--of Mrs. Rufus Gresham. "Yes, Julia, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting; but I had a note this morning for a little informal company at the Merwins' this evening. If it had been on a larger scale I should certainly have de-   ONE MAN S WORK.       291 dined, for you know 'what a bore a large party is to me; but I could find no reasonable excuse, and had, after all, a pleasant, social, reasonable time." Mrs. Gresham smiled. "I should know any where that those adjectives came from you and nobody else." And Cleveland smiled in return. "Well, they are just what all adjectives should be, simple, truthful exponents of facts. We leave the intensified and inflated ones to your sex." Mrs. Gresham respected and feared her brother a little. He was a profound puzzle to her-a real provocation sometimes-but she occasionally got glimpses, through him, of a better, higher life than the one in which she revolved. He frequently held up certain of the weaknesses, foibles, and sins of her sex in general, and of her set in particular, in a half-ironical, half-protesting way, which placed them before her in such a light that she could not help seeing and half acknowledging them. "Whom among the sex you profess to despise did you meet this evening?" asked the lady, not, as usual, taking up the gauntlet in defense thereof. "That last question of yours involves a most specious sophistry, my dear. Instead of despising your sex, it is because I so honor and reverence it from my inmost soul, that it is a continual pain and anguish to me to see woman so disloyal to her high- est self and mission on the earth, absorbed in self- ishness, in petty rivalries, and aims, and ambi-   292      ONE MAN'S WORK. tions-false to, duty, to herself, to her God--it is because that I see these things daily that I some-- times speak of woman with irony and bitterness, instead of with that tenderness and reverence with which man always should." "I suppose you include your sister among those women whom you condemn?" said Mrs. Gresham, with a little conscious look. "Yes; I will not spoil a story for relation's sakes. I include my sister among those very women." Mrs. Gresham did not seem indignant. Indeed, there was an expression of softness, which almost touched on humility, on her usually-complacent face-an expression which was never seen there unless it might be in some conversation like the present with her brother. "Well, I will not dispute the position you assign me now; and, in return for my good nature, do answer my question." "I beg your pardon;-- I've really forgotten it, Julia. "Did you wait on any lady home from   this party?"- changing somewhat the spirit and form of her first question, "Yes; Mrs. Northam." "Mrs. Northam - a married woman  Cleveland!" "Why not? her husband was absent; the young ladies seemed mostly supplied with company, and so I volunteered nlyself for Mrs. Northam's service, as her husband was not there; and she did not wait   ONE MAN S WORK.       293 for her carriage, but left early, as I did. What do you know of the lady?" "Not much, except that the Northams move in the very best society. She was married about two years ago, and her husband can't be far from thirty years her senior. She was an orphan, and her uncle, who was her guardian, it is said, helped him- self to most of her property--which was n't large- and then half allured, half compelled her into this marriage. She was a prize for Robert Northam. I think he is proud of her; but the marriage could never have been a congenial one for the lady." The gentleman did not answer. He was debat- ing with himself whether he should relate to his sister what had transpired that evening. She looked at him and was silent for a little while; at last he lifted his eyes from the carpet and met hers. "What are you thinking about me, Julia?" "That I wonder if you 'll ever get married. Shall you, Cleveland?" The gentleman drew a deep sigh. "I do n't know," speaking half to himself. "If I can ever find the right sort of a woman-a woman, earnest, tender, noble-whose influence and atmos- phere about my life will tend to stimulate and nour- ish the best part of me; who will, in short, make me a better man, and to whom I can be what, by right of my manhood I should be-strength, pro- tection, love-then, surely, I shall marry her, Julia."   294       ONE MAN S WORIK. "I wonder if there is a woman made -especially to suit you! I'd go a good ways to see her." Cleveland looked at his watch, and rose up. He had made up his mind to communicate nothing to his sister. She had not the tender sympathies to enter into it, and all he could say would only stim- ulate her wonder and curiosity. So he bade Mrs. Gresham good-night, and went to his own chamber; and in his prayer before he slept, Cleveland King remembered before God the face of the pale young wife, as he had seen- her standing in the front door, and he prayed him whatsoever bewilderment or an- guish, whatsoever fear or suffering was about her life, to lead her in the right way, the way of duty, of light, and of peace. The next day, when Cleveland King walked down to the office, the face and voice of Mrs. Northam was still in his thoughts. They haunted and troubled, and appealed to him through all the business of the morning; and he found himself fre- quently pondering the question--"Can I do any thing to aid or to serve this woman?" It was a delicate matter to manage, and Cleve- land King remained longer in doubt over it than he often was over any course of action. But he said to himself at last--"My motive is one that I am not ashamed of before God -I need not be before man. - It is simply to render this woman any serv- ice of advice or. help which some strait of her life may require. I will make some errand for calling   ONE MAN S WORK.       295 on her at this time, and then if I watch for an op- portunity, and God wills, the way will probably be opened for me to say all that is needed. And so Cleveland King having come to his determination, acted upon it at once. The young man did not wait long in the luxurious parlors, where taste and wealth had combined to produce splendor and beauty. The rich carpets, where the feet seemed sinking into forest mosses, the white gleam of the statues in the corners, the glow of the rose-wood fur- niture, the gilded walls flushed with rare pictures, and the lace curtains which seemed like heaps of snowy mist: Cleveland King had only time to linger a moment on these, when the mistress of all this splendor made her appearance. That young, fair face--that graceful, girlish figure, it seemed, somehow, as if the years had not yet fitted her for her place and station, yet she came forward with a grave, easy dignity, and gave her hand to her guest with a graciousness and self- possession which showed she was used to doing the honors of her stately home. Mrs. Northam could not, however, quite disguise her surprise on seeing her guest, but she was too well-bred a woman to manifest it in any way which would embarrass her guest; so the conversation slip- ped into easy and general channels. XCleveland's ostensible reason for this call was to learn the address of a mutual friend, which he was really desirous of obtaining, and which gFrs. Nor-  ,    96       ONE MAN'S WORK. tham furnished him at once. As she lifted her face to him in the interest of their conversation, he watched it narrowly, and he saw, at times, a troubled, anxious look flit over it; sometimes the look deepened into pain, and the deep-blue eyes would seem to be wandering after her thoughts, and Mrs. Northam would seem unconscious of her guest. Then she would rouse herself with an effort and take up the thread of- conversation,' or intro- duce some new topic with easy grace, and yet, all the time, it was evident to Cleveland King that some dread and pain lay cold and heavy on the heart of his hostess. At last, in a little pause of the conversation, he spoke: "I feel singularly impelled to say to you, Mrs. Northam, that the ostensible reason of my calling is not the real one. I am aware, too, that my con- duct must seem singuiar, and probably intrusive to a stranger, but I have, somehow, a conviction that in this matter you will not' misinterpret me or my motives ?" He paused; the fair young face of his hostess was lifted in wonder to his, and it seemed,to him in fear--not of him, but of something beyond; yet she answered simply and earnestly to his question: "I do not think I shall, Mr. King!" "Well, then, I am emboldened to speak to you frankly and plainly, trusting that you will receive it in just the spirit that I speak. I have been haunted all day by a singular feeling that you are   in some trouble, some strait or trial in which it is possible you may have no friend to consult or to aid you; or those who have the right and the au- thority to do this, may for some reason be excluded from your confidence. I do not seek it--I have no claim to do it, only if you can trust me as a friend, I am willing to serve you by word or deed, and I shall ask no questions, any further than may be necessary. You yourself know whether my suspi- cions are true, and if they are not, forgive a stran- ger whose only motive was to serve you as a friend." Doubt, amazement, indecision had by turns strug- gled for the mastery in Mrs. Northam's face. As her guest closed his singular offer she tried- to speak, but a sudden sob swelled in her throat and mastered the words-she broke down into a con- vulsion of sobs and tears. Her guest looked at her, and a feeling of pity, that was almost tenderness, for the forlorn young creature in the midst of her splendor came over him. He longed to shield her from, or avert the invisible evil which was hanging over her young life. Instinctively he reached out his hand to lay it on hers, and then he remembered she was the wife of another man, and -he withdrew it; for Cleveland King was an honest man, a true man to the core; no word or act would he bestow on any woman, which, were that woman his wife, he would hesitate to see her receive from any other man; and so he was always a '"law unto himself."   298      ONE MAN S WORK. At last the storm cleared its way into calm. Mrs. Northam looked up into Cleveland King's face. How those earnest blue eyes searched and penetrated it! Her woman's intuition was true; it was a strong, manly, honest face; a face to be be- lieved in, trusted in any temptation, in any con- juncture of trying and evil circumstances; a face that bore witness to a soul which would be true to itself, and so, true to all men and women besides. Mrs. Northam drew a little nearer. "Yes," she said, in a low, rapid, frightened voice, "I am in terrible trouble, and there is no one in 'the whole world to help me." "I felt it ever since I heard your voice call to me, and saw your face for a moment last night.". "O, sir, I know I told you a falsehood; but really I was so confused and frightened I didn't know what I said; and it all came upon me so sudden, too -a great avalanche of anguish that I couldn't bear--and so, as you turned away the cry leaped out of my lips before I was aware. It flashed up to me in a moment all the good and kind things I had heard of you, from the children of the Sabbath school of which you are superintendent, and-others; and I felt so helpless and desolate, and I longed so for some counsel and sympathy, and it seemed so hard to struggle on any longer with this terrible burden, and I wished for the moment, with an unutterable wish, that you were my friend, whom I could go to, and confide in, at this time; and   ONE MAN S WORK.      , 299 then, before I knew or could help it, the cry you heard leaped out of my heart." It seemed now that these words leaped out of her heart too, she spoke in such a low, rapid tone, as though they came almost without any volition of hers, and she dared not stop to reflect on the con- sequences of what she was saying. There was a little silence. "God must have sent me here this morning," thought Cleveland King. "'And so-you understand, Mrs. Northam, that I heard the cry, and have come here now to answer it, by serving you in any right and just way that I can." Another frightened glance into his face, that an- swered for itself. "I ought to tell you all now, but the trouble in- volves another another who is dearer than life to me;" and the paleness. of her face was overflowed now with deep blushes, as she buried it in her hands. Her words and pantomime startled her hearer with a new fear. Could it be that the desolate young creature, in the midst of all her splendor, had been lured into temptation, and had bestowed on another the confidence and affection which she had no right to do; and had the evil led to the confusion and suffering which sooner or later it must inevitably do? The thoughts chased themselves rapidly through Cleveland King's mind, and before   300      -ONE MAN'S WORK. he was aware they had shaped themselves into this question- "I hope this friend is not one for whose sake another must be wronged?" She understood him; in an instant the bowed head was lifted quickly, and her face answered for her before her voice with its calm scorn did- "I assure you, sir, that any love I may feel or express for my own brother is nothing for which I have reason to blush." Her wordg lifted a sudden burden from his heart. It was his turn now to feel embarrassed. "Forgive me, Mrs. Northam, if for a moment your words made me misapprehend you." "Yes; it was perhaps natural they should; and now I have told you so much, it is necessary you should know the whole." And so, little by little, Cleveland King learned the truth. We will not give it in Mrs. Northam's words; for it was pitiful to see the poor young wife's distress, and how often she had to pause in the midst of her story and wring her hands, as dread, terror, shame by turns convulsed her. This was what Cleveland King learned. Her only brother, Calvin Humphrey, had been dis- charged from college for the remainder of the term, because of some foolish sophomore frolic in which he had been involved, with several other members of his class. He had left the city and gone to-some watering-place, where he had fallen in among evil 9  .   ONE MAN'S WORK.       301 men, and into evil ways. He had gambled--he had become very heavily involved in debt; his creditors had been inexorable, and one night, after drinking deeply, and stung to desperation by the thought of his debts, he had used the name of his brother-in-law to the amount of four thousand dol- lars, hoping to be able to redeem the note before it should be due. But he had lost the entire sum at the gaming-table. The note would be due in a few days, and so, driven to desperation, the young man had at last written to his sister, in a state border- ing on madness, and he had solemnly declared his determination to end his own existence, rather than confront the disgrace which must follow the dis- covery of his crimes, and Mrs. Northam understood Calvin Humphrey too well to feel that this was on his part an idle threat. "You will not utterly condemn Calvin because of what I have said?" besought the young wife, as she closed her painful story. He is so young-hardly twenty--so generous and warm-hearted, that all who know him best love him most; but he is im- pulsive and impressible, and this has led him into evil company, and, alas! into this terrible sin; and now I can not help lhim!" and the lady forgot her guest and wrung her'hands again. He was certainly shocked at the story, but all , other emotions were mastered by the young sister's distress. "Mrs. Northam," he said, "I am sorry for your !   302      ONE MAN S' WORK. brother from my heart. I shall not think now of the wrong he has done, only of how I can serve and save him." She looked up with such ia radiant glow of thanks that there was no need she should speak, although she tried to-tried and failed. "And in order to help him in the best way, I must make a few inquiries which under other circum- stances must seem intrusive." "O sir, you may ask me any thing!" "Your husband-does he know any thing of all this?" Mrs. Northam sat so near her interlocutor that he felt at this moment the shiver which went over her. "O no!" she gasped with a look of terror. "The truth is, Mr. King, my husband is not kindly dis- posed toward Calvin; for my brother strenuously opposed our marriage, nearly three years ago, though he was but a boy at the time, and brought on himself the indignation of uncle Harry in conse- quence. I should not dare to tell Mr. Northam. I do not know that even -for my sake he would save Calvin, and, at all events, he would drive him to desperation. Do not ask me any thing more," and once more the lady turned away her white face, and buried it in her hands. Cleveland King sat silent, while a storm of indig- nation thundered over his soul. What a glimpse of that poor young creature's married life had she just revealed to him! What a witness that she still held herself loyal to the innermost spirit of her   ONE MAN'S WORK.       803 marriage vows, to the name and the duty of wife, was in that appealing cry of hers--"Do not ask me fur- ther!"Even then she would not betray her hus- band by one word of reproach or blame--not even then, when he held the honor, the very life of her brother in his hands, and she, his wife, did not dare to throw herself at his feet, and beg the man" for her sake to save him, though he would in nowise have missed the few thousands from his vaults, and could with them have saved from anguish, bitterer than death, the wife whom he had taken in her sweet and thoughtless girlhood to love, protect, and cherish. Not even then would she speak. Truly this woman was above other women! And Cleveland King's heart ached as he looked on her and thought of her desolate grandeur, and thought, too, how she had been sacrificed to cu- pidity and pride, and his heart rose up almost as fiercely against her dead uncle as it did against her living husband.  But in a little while he had con- trolled himself to consider what was to be done, and the best way of accomplishing it, and his voice had a kindly, tranquilizing tone as he said, "It will be best for me to see your brother, Mrs. Northam, in order to be of most service to him;" and his remark, going so wide of her last speech, showed how fully he understood and appreciated both it and her. "O, sir, if you only will see Calvin!" her smile, out of its tears, was radiant.   ONE MAN'S WORK. "And you will give me a letter of introduction to him, stating that I am his friend and yours, and knowing all have come to serve him?" " Mk.I King"-    "There, I am not going to let you thank me at all, Mrs. Northam. Indeed; I shall be rude enough to tell you that I have n't time to hear you; but I shall send a porter for the letter and take the cars before six o'clock. I am a practical man, not much given to sentiment, you see;" and he rose up and had moved half way across the room, when Mrs. Northam sprang to his-side, and laid her hand on his arm. "I have fifteen hundred dollars--you must take that," she stammered, her face stained with tears, burning with blushes, shame, gratitude, relief, all struggling in her face. "I have sold the diamonds uncle Harry gave me at my wedding, and I can raise the rest after a while. 0, sir, may God re- member you for this day's work!" He lifted the little hand which lay light as a flake of snow on his arm, and kissed it gravely and reverently, as belonging to another, and without speaking a word went out. Late that afternoon Cleveland King received a note from Mrs. Northam, inclosing a letter to her brother and the fifteen hundred dollars of which she had spoken. The next morning he was at the watering-place where the young student had gone to rusticate the weeks of his dismissal from college.   ONE MAN'S WORK.   It was not difficult to find his address, and Cleve- land King accordingly dispatched a brief note to' him, designating the house where he could be found that morning, and referring to his sister's letter, which he inclosed, for all further explanations. An hour later the brother of Mrs. Northam pre- sented himself before Mr. King. He was.a slender, fine-looking young man, with a family resemblance to his sister, although the soft, delicate features of Mrs. Northam were cut in stronger, bolder lines. It was not a bad face, only the mouth lacked some- thing of character and decision, which years might give it, but which was the key to the weak side of Calvin Humphrey's character; yet the mouth was not weak after all-only boyish. But what shocked Cleveland King was the hag- gard, pallid face of the young student. Truly, the ways of evil had not been to him smooth and pleas- ant ones. Shame, remorse, anxiety must have eaten deep into the life of Calvin Humphrey, to have wrought that anguish in his young face, to have filled those dark, hollow eyes with their look of de- spair. The two' men grasped hands, and looked in each other's faces. Cleveland King had one, as I said, that any man might trust. The younger spoke first. "I have read Ellen's letter," he said. "She tells me that you know all, and that you have come here to help me." It was a relief to Cleveland King to have the 26 306      ONE MAN S WORK. subject opened in this plain, direct fashion. It saved all embarrassment on both sides, and the elder had fine intuition enough to perceive that now was not the time for counsel and advice. He wanted to gain a strong hold on the confidence and ,affection of the young man in whom he had felt so keen an interest-first for his sister's, and now for his own sake. So he answered him-- "I came, sir, for that especial object-to render you what service I could, and here is the proof of it." He drew some papers from his pocket and slipped them into the young man's hand. That contains my check," he said, "for twenty-five hund- red dollars. You will also find bank-notes there to the amount of fifteen hundred, which your sister, having sold her diamonds, was enabled to send you.  Calvin Humphrey drew his hand across his fore- head. "I am a free man now," he said; "I expected to be a dead one before night!" It was evident that he had been through a ter- rible experience-,one which must haunt him more or less for a lifetime, and out of which he must come a better or a worse man. The terrible incu- bus was removed too suddenly for the young stu- dent to fully realize it. There were no transports of joy over his deliverance, as there would have been had the terror been slighter. "That was wrong, my young friend," answered   ONE MAN S WORK.      307 the calm, kindly voice of Cleveland King,- "But the way you have taken always leads to that road. You should have trusted to God to deliver-you." "Has God done this for me?" asked the young man, and the hollow eyes suddenly grew damp with tears, and he reached out for the hand of Cleveland King. "God has done it, my friend," he said, grasping the other.{ "Carry this thought in your heart when you go out now to use this money--for the purpose for which you understand it is given you." "I will be back in an hour, and then I will say to you what I can not till the money is paid." "Poor fellow-poor fatherless boy!" murmured to himself Cleveland King, as he closed the door after the other, and resumed his walk up and down the room. "And yet, after all, this terrible lesson may prove, under God, his salvation. His whole nature will be tender and impressible now. I will seize this golden moment for reaching and influ- encing him for good." In less than an hour Calvin Humphrey returned. The haggard anguish was gone now-a new life and joy irradiated his face. He seized the hands of his new friend and wrung them. a O, sir," he- said, " do you kn6w you have saved me?" And even while he spoke a sudden pallor crept up and, vanquished the life in the speaker's face. He staggered and fell back, and if the strong arm   308      ONE MAN S WOEK. of Cleveland King had not been there, he would have fallen senseless to the floor. When the young student opened his eyes he did not recognize the grave, kindly face which bent over him, nor the voice-soft as a father's-which called to him. The reaction from that long anguish had been too much for the young man's physical and mental powers, after the long strain upon them. For the next three days he was in a raging fever, which crept up to his brain, and during which he raved continually to Cleveland King, who watched by his bedside. The sick man disclosed much of his character and life during these ravings. His intense dislike of his brother-in-law, whose coarse, selfish nature his finer instincts penetrated; his tender love for his only sister, whom he regarded as utterly sacrificed by her uncle to a man for whose character she could have little respect or af- fection-the fact that out of her own allowance she generously defrayed his expenses at college; and all the -peculiar temptations to which the young man had been subjected before his fall, were revealed to Cleveland King. They only served to increase his interest in his pity for the young life which lay so blighted and nearly broken before him. - On the third day of his illness a long and refreshing slumber fell upon Cal- vin Humphrey; and when at'last, toward the close of the sweet Autumn day, he opened his eyes and saw the kindly face which bent over him, a look of   ONE MAN'S WORE.       309 perplexity and bewilderment filled them. In a little while, however, memory returned; he closed his eyes, and' when he opened them again they were laden with touching gratitude for his benefactor. "You know me?" asked Cleveland King. "Yes--and all. How long have I been sick?" "Three days; the danger is over now. Your' physician says you'll come out a new man." The pale lips of the invalid smiled sadly. Cleve- land understood him. "Yes, my friend, I trust and believe you will be that in a better, higher sense than your doctor means it." "If I do I shall owe it all to you," answered the invalid. "No; give the glory where it only belongs--to God!" There was a little silence here. Calvin was the first to break it. "Have you been with me all this time?" "Yes, my friend, I was bound to see this job through." And after this the young men had a long talk- a talk which neither of them ever forgot; and Cal- vin Humphrey learned, then and there, all which had transpired betwixt his sister and his benefactor; and when he heard it he turned his head softly on the pillow, and tears rained down the pale cheeks; and Cleveland King blessed God in his heart; for he knew they were tears of repentance and healing.   310      ONE MAN'S WORK. At last he said, turning his face suddenly toward Cleveland- -  "My precious sister-I wish I could see her!' "I will write her this very night, so that she may come up and take my place here. I did not mention your illness in-the note I dispatched two 'days ago, to be delivered by my porter into her hands. I feared to add to her anxiety." "Poor Ellen-she would come if she could; but I am doubtful about her gaining her husband's per- mission to do this. The man bears me a deep-seated grudge, and would be glad to annoy me in any way he could, at any cost of suffering on Ellen's part. Still he might not dare to refuse, for the looks of the thing." "Is the man a brute to your sister?" "Not exactly that, but he is of a coarse, hard, unsympathizing quality, pompous and self-conceited too, and when he is crossed, a tyrant." "What a sacrifice!" said Cleveland King, with a shudder. "Yes; boy as I was, I opposed the marriage with all my might; and Ellen-pobr child-wavered many times. But uncle Harry, as we afterward learned, had good and sufficient reasons for desiring the consummation of this marriage, and he argued and plead, and appealed to Ellen's affection for him,/ and so at last it was done." "I am afraid you are exhausting yourself, my young friend, by talking so much. You must not   ONE MAN S WORK.       3" talk any more now. I shall write to your sister to-night about you." Mr. Northam ?" There was a little hesitancy--a little doubt, or reluctance which inhered in the lady's articulation. "Well, what is it?" asked Mr. Benjamin Nor- tham, settling himself back in his easy chair, and opening his paper. He was in his after-dinner mood, which was always his most complacent one. Ile sat there, a heavy-framed, stolid, pompous man, with a rather hard-featured, yet on the whole, not uncomely face; a face which, however, the more you studied it, the less you found to like in it. A certain hardness and coarseness interpenetrated it. The gray eyes were keen and cold. You would not have liked to have been that man's debtor, or to have solicited a favor of him. The tones with which he answered his wife were not inviting. There was something in them which, to very fine intuitions, implied that the man was conscious he was master of her and his house, and that in one way or another he would make others feel-it also. There was a little pause before the words came. The lady sat opposite her husband, in the little graceful alcove which opened out of the parlors. Any one watching her narrowly might have per- ceived that she was agitated, and making a despe- rate effort to overcome the feeling. Her fingers played nervously with a paper-folder, which she  312      ONE MAN'S WORK. had taken from the little table on her right. At last she looked up and said, "I have heard from Calvin to-day." The words came out steady, but hurried, as though they cost her an effort; but her face, a little quieter and paler than usual, witnessed for her now, that having said the words, she would stand by them, and that she had, if necessary, some reserve- courage to fall back upon. Mr. Northam's first look was one of astonish- ment; then his brow darkened angrily. "I thought, Mrs. Northam, that subject was never to be mentioned between us." "And I have always complied with your wishes in the matter, as you know; but the time for speak- ing has come now. The letter is not from my brother, but a friend of his, Mr. Cleveland King, who happens to be with him"-and here Mrs. Nor- tham paused a breath, to thank God that her. brother was entirely and absolutely out of her hus- band's power- " and with whose name you doubt- less are acquainted. The gentleman writes me that Calvin has been very ill." "Your brother's health is. no concern of mine, and I had rather not have the subject intruded on me," was the unfeeling rejoinder, and with a lower- ing face, and what he intended should be a majestic air of disapproval, settled himself to his paper. "But it is of mine-his own sister's." The lady's courage was evidently rising-a small flame   ONE MAN'S WOREK.       13 burned steadily in her pale cheek. "He is absent from college at this time, at a hotel, and among entire strangers, saving for the presence of Mr. King, who is compelled to' return to the city." "Mrs. Northam, what is to be the end of all this?" asked her husband, putting down his paper, and confronting his wife's face, and confronting, too, something there which he never had done before. "Simply that my brother is very ill, and needs my care, and I must go to him for a day or two, at least." Mr. Northam  was thoroughly astounded. His authority contemned, his will set at defiance in his own house, and by his wife, too; the gentle child- woman who had always stood in awe of his will and temper, and whom he had found so easy to bend to his authority. The worst side of the man was aroused-the hard, inflexible side; for gen- erally, Benjamin Northam, if he had his own way, and received a certain deference from those about him, which pleased his vanity, was in tolerably good humor. He brought down his hand on the table. "Mrs. Northam," he thundered, "you shall not leave this house to go to your brother, be he dead or alive! I forbid that!"-all his temper roused now. She rose up quietly; the flame had quite died out of her face and left it white as ashes, still there was a look on it such as we fancy some kind of 27   314      ONE MAN'S WORK. generals might wear at the head of an army, just before they gave the order to charge, on the enemy- she, the little, delicate, shrinking woman. "Do it if you dare, Benjamin INortham!" said, low and emphatic, the white lips of his wife. The man was taken aback. He had never con- fronted a spirit like that; for the moment blank amazement superseded the hot anger in his face; but it burned back in a moment, for Mr. Northam had too much aggressiveness and determination to have it easily overcome. "This is really very ridiculous of you, Mrs. Nor- tham. You'd better think twice before you take it on yourself to disobey my commands." "I. have, Benjamin Northam. I should be very likely to do that, when you know that from the hour I became your wife, I have been obedient to every wish of yours, and have yielded my own rights, my own wishes, my own happiness, so many. times to yours; and you know, too, whether you have dealt generously or justly by the woman you prevailed upon with promises you have not kept, to marry you in her early girlhood, before she was old enough to understand you, or comprehend her own rights, and brought her to the home where you have been more of a tyrant than a husband to her!" The words, or rather the truth in the words, stung the self-sufficient man--stung him into fiercer anger; and yet, he began to feel a kind of respect   ONE MAN'S WORK.       315 for his young wife which he had never felt before. He found there was some latent force and spirit in her, which he had never suspected till now. "When you get through, I will answer, Mrs. Northam," was the sneering retort, but in his secret soul he had a feeling that he was losing ground in this talk. "I want only a few   moments, and I shall be done. I have made up my mind to take the even- ing train to my sick, it may be dying brother. If you turn me out of your house now and forever, I shall go. If by violence you compel me to remain away from him, I shall tell this whole story on the very first opportunity which I have, and you can best tell whose side public opinion will take in this matter, and whether there is one man or woman for whose respect you will care, who will not absolutely despise and condemn you for your cruelty, for I shall hold nothing back; the world shall know the whole, and that your only reason for persecuting my only brother, for forbidding him your house, and commanding me never to utter his name in your presence, was simply and entirely because he feared to give his only sister, when she was little more than a child, into your power, lest you should not make her, what I solemnly declare before God you have not, a kind and tender husband! And I shall tell, also, that when my fatherless, mother- less brother lay sick, and it may be dying, in a strange place, among strangers, you refused to let   316      ONE MAN'S WORFE. me go to his side, you even compelled me to re- main away from him, when I besought you to let me, the only sister he had on earth, go to him, to do for him what I could with my presence and care; and you know, too, that when this story is circu- lated of you, throughout this city, as,. if you drive me to desperation, it surely shall be, there is not a decent man or woman in it who will not call you a brute." It was strong language, and put in a way that would tell best with a man like Benjamin Northam; for, like most pompous, conceited people, who have made for themselves a position, and pride them- selves on it, he was sensitive respecting the opin- ions of others, and the fear of social ridicule or contempt was one of his 'weak points. He had sense enough to perceive that his wife was in the right, and if she disclosed the simple facts concern- ing this treatment of her and her brother, all- his wealth would not procure'him indemnity from the indignation and contempt of the community. He looked in her face once more. There it stood-pale, resolute, defiant to the death. oShe would do all she said; he felt it. He, Benjamin Northam, was in this one little, fragile woman's power. He must yield. The knowledge galled and infuriated him; he would do it in the way to pre- serve his insulted dignity, and wound her as much as possible. So he cleared his throat, and rose up- "Mrs. Northam," attempting by a new accession   ONE MAN'S WORK.       317 of dignity to atone for his waning authority, "I have no time to waste with you to-day in such mat- ters. - If you desire to go into tragedies, I wish. you to understand, once for all, that it is quite out of my line. You know already my wishes in the mat- ter; but as I never have used violence, as you term it, to compel you -into obedience, so. neither shall I do it now, and you will take your own course;" and he walked out of the room, and slammed the door. Mrs. Northam had triumphed. For a moment her face showed it, kindling into a kind of fierce exultation. Then she sank down into her chair- the spirit which had sustained her broke down. "I've conquered this time," murmured the poor young wife. "I shall go to Calvin--but 0, what a price I 've paid for it!" and a look of mingled agony and disgust tortured the fair face of Ellen Northam. "To frighten my husband into justice, to be compelled to threaten the man whom I ought to honor and, love into an act of simple humanity toward his wife-0, it's terrible, it's terrible !" and sobs shook her to and fro as the branches of pines are shaken by storms on the sea-shore, and she clasped the palms of her small hands together in her anguish and desolation, as she thought how she must carry this great sorrow and shame through all her life, and Ellen Northam needed to pray as she did, "God be pitiful to me!" But she had gained a greater victory than she  S318      ONE MAN'S WORK. suspected, for from that hour Ellen Northam was mistress of her own house. Her husband did not forget the desperate spirit that he had once roused in his young wife, and he did not care to encounter it again. Of course he was pompous and self-con- ceited, and liked to make as great a display of his authority as ever, but the essence of domestic abso- lutism had disappeared. His wife had met him once on his own ground, and vanquished him. Then the way in which she had put his tyranny to him- self had a profound effect; for he saw how it must appear to others, and the esteem of his fellow-men was something Benjamin Northam could not afford to lose. Had his wife been in his power, as, but for ClevelandeKing she surely must, the matter would have been entirely changed; and it is, to say the least, extremely doubtful whether the man would have been reached sufficiently by his wife's suppli- cations and anguish, to save her brother from the exposure of his crime and the disgraceowhich must inevitably have followed it. But when his own conduct was placed before him in a light which he saw very plainly would outrage public sentiment and result in his own disgrace, then Benjamin Northam felt as nearly guilty, and! experienced something as closely resembling com- punctions of conscience as it was possible for a nature so pompous and self-inflated to do. He saw through the world'seyes, and his wife had actually (   ONE MAN'S WORK.       3 9 made him for once stand in fear of her, and the lesson was one he would not be likely to forget. It was of course very contemptible, but there are a great many contemptible men in the world, and probably will be-till the millennium. "Come in", said the voice of Calvin Humphrey to the soft knock which came at his door with the early day. Cleveland King had been obliged to leave him late the night tefore, and the young convalescent had been watching the morning sun- shine as it spattered the walls and lay bright on the floor of his chamber; and while he watched, Calvin Humphrey held solemn communion with himself. The door opened softly--the sweet, temulous face of a woman put itself inside the room- "O, Ellen!"Calvin Humphrey lifted his head from his pillow, and his heart was in his cry. She sprang forward, and the next moment the brother and sister were in each other's arms. There were no words for the next half hour. They wept but together, as children do, some of the pain and sorrow that was in both their hearts. "O, Ellen, it was good-it was like you to come to me now!" and the young student caressed the pale, wistful face with his hand. "I began to fear that he would prevent your coming." Something of the dauntless, defiant look of the day before returned to Mrs. Northam's face.   -ONE MAN'S WORK. "He tried to," she said; "but I stood up and dared him to do it to his face; and for the first time in his life Benjamin Northam was afraid of me." "And you have traveled all night to get to my bedside, poor little sister!" She smiled out of her face, that looked pale and weary now for want of sleep. "O, Calvin, the night didn't seem long, because I was coming to you!" And then the magnitude of his sin-the shame and anguish it must have wrought for the sister, who, for his sake, would have sacrificed her life, came over the young student as they never had done befoe. He clasped his, hands over his pale face, burning up suddenly into shame and anguish, and his voice choked through the words- "0, Ellen, can you forgive me?" Her answer came in a whisper, soft as an angel's might- "I did that, Calvin, before I came here." He looked up now, with eyes full of tender rev- erence - "O, Ellen, if you knew it all you would think my suffering had atoned for my sin!" She clung to him now--the emotion and her face telling what she would not allow her lips to--all that she had suffered. "O, Calvin, for the sake, and in the name of our dead father and mother; for the sake of your own   I   soul here and hereafter, and for the sake of my heart, that will break for grief if you do, promise me that you will never yield to this temptation again!" He held her hands and looked up in her face- "Ellen, can you trust me?" he asked. Calvin Humphrey's face was at that moment for a sign and a witness for him. His sister looked at him, and answered fervently, "Yes, Calvin, from my soul I do trust you." Afterward there was silence betwixt them. Mrs. Northam remained three days with her brother; and during that time the invalid recuperated rap- idly, and was able to ride- out with his sister the morning before she left. Those three days were, on the whole, the happiest which the two had passed since the careless, happy boy and girlhood which grew up under their uncle's roof--their good-natured, improvident uncle, whose last days had been his worst; for he had not the moral courage to meet the consequences of his own mistakes and betrayal of his trusts, and conse- quently sacrificed his niece to save himself. But Mrs. Northam and her brother, in so far as it was possible, during this time, put the inevitably- dark side of their lives out of sight. They were both young and of bright and hopeful natures, and the recuperative forces of youth were yet strong in both. They talked of the old, happy days; they laid plans for the future, they comforted and   ONE MAN'S WORK. strengthened each other; and when the last hour of Mrs. Northam's visit drew near, they both looked wonderfully better and happier. "I shall get down to college by next week, and, Ellen, I mean to make up for lost time," said Cal- vin Humphrey, gravely, as his sister sat by his side, her hand clasped in his; for the inexorable hour was nigh. "You must not work too hard, dear," with a kind of mother-fondness in eyes that looked on the face she was so soon to leave. "I shall go through New York. You will come to see me at the depot ?' "No; you must come to see me next time!" she said, with a significant look. The st:uent started in amazement. "No, Ellen, I shall not subject myself to insult from your husband," he answered, after a little pause; and the look Mr. Northam had seen in his wife's face was in her brother's now. "You know he would only turn me out of the house." "If I believed that, Calvin, I should not ask you to come; but I have not lived for the last four years in vain with Benjamin Northam. I have found there is one thing which he does stand in awe and fear of, and that is public opinion. Rather than brave this, I believe he will allow you to visit me, or, at least, withdraw his overt opposition to it. Yes, Calvin, you must stop at our house on your way to college;" and Mrs. Northam rose up lightly   and went to her own room; for her watch-hands were creeping toward the last moment. "What a sister she is!" murmured Calvin Hum- phrey; and he shut his eyes- shutting down the tears in them, too. But she had caught the words, and came back a moment after with her bonnet on. "Say rather, Calvin," she said, with her sweet smile a little tremulous, "what a friend we had!" "I do say that many times every day." "The event proved that Mrs. Northam      had judged her husband rightly. She found him, on her return, sullen and reticent, and he maintained a somewhat morose demeanor for several days; but he did not once make the most distant allusion to her visit, neither did she. It happened that the day on which Calvin Hum- phrey wrote his sister she might expect him in New York, her husband was quite unusually sum- moned out of town on business. His complaisance, such as it was, had returned to him by this time; indeed, in several instances he had avoided annoy- ing his wife after his old fashion. "1 shall be gone three days, Ellen," he said to her; "and if you feel timid about sleeping alone in your part of the house, I'll send our head book- keeper up each night during my absence." The young wife was always touched at any little courtesy or thoughtfulness on her husband's part, which proved that he cared any thing for her be-   324      ONE MAN S WOREK. yond the mere pride which he took in her as a graceful and crowning adornment to his home-the same sort of pride which he had for his horses, and which, after all, was nothing but self-worship; and there was a timid entreaty in -Mrs. Northam's eyes as. she looked up- "Thank you; my brother has written me that he shall be in New York'for a day or two on his re- turn to college. I hope you will not object to his stopping here?" The heavy brow lowered--there was a murky gleam of anger in the gray eyes. "I have told you, once for all, Mrs. Northam, that your brother shall never cross my threshold, and he never shall.'; That was not the way to deal with this man. Gentleness, timidity, entreaty roused the aggress- iveness and the tyrant within him. The latent spirit that Benjamin Northam had once seen in his wife was awake again. She was out of her chair in a moment--her face steadfast, her lips resolute, her eyes blazing-- "Very well, Mr. Northam. If my brother can not cross my threshold, I shall simply accompany him to your partner's, explain how he has been, and is, and from what cause, debarred from your threshold, and ask permission to have him remain there, where I can daily see him during his brief visit. I am certain they will not refuse so just a- request; and you can make your choice betwixt   ONE MAN'S WORK.       325 your own house and your partner's, for I shall surely do as I have said." "The d-1 you will, ma'am," said Benjamin Northam, looking at his wife in a kind of blank amazement-in a kind of new respect, too, which, for the moment, superseded his anger. "Yes, I shall," she said, seating herself once more, quietly, and when he looked at her face, he knew she would, too. He brought down his hand heavily on the table; he swore a fierce oath at her; then Benjamin Nor- tham rose up and went out of the room, slamming the door after him. Mrs. Northam had triumphed the second time, but each one cost her, as it must any refined, right- minded woman, a terrible wear and tear of soul and body. Four years had passed away. Most of this time Cleveland King had passed abroad, it having become necessary for one of the partners of his house to give personal supervision to its financial relations in Europe; and the youngest one's tastes and charac- ter was peculiarly fitted for this department. Cleveland King had, after three years, returned. to his native land. He had traveled a great part of this time, and, as all true travelers -should, he had lived as far as was possible the life of the people amidst whom he sojourned. New aspects of life, social, civil, political and religious, had pre-   326      ONE MAN'S WORK. sented themselves to his observation and study. He had learned much; -he had interested himself in the forms of government, the national develop- ment, in all its varied phases, of the people among whom he dwelt; and he was a man to go right down into the quick and essence of things, not to be satisfied with any mere artistic and surface views. Of course these four years had wrought many changes in the man-had made him larger, more liberal in thought and feeling; but the tender heart, the warm, generous instincts, the childlike faith, combined with that sterling principle and integrity which nothing could shake or corrupt--these were still a part of Cleveland King. Of Mrs. Northam he had heard but once, and that was about a year after he had left America. He happened to be in Brussels at the time, and there received a letter from her, inclosing the- twenty-five hundred dollars for which she was his debtor. It was a brief letter-one that touched Cleveland King; for the emotions which inspired it had overswayed the writer's heart and broke into her words. Of course he acknowledged her letter, and there was an end of the correspondence; but often amid his wanderings the pale, sweet face of the fair young wife rose up before Cleveland King, as he had seen it in the midst of her home of desolate grandeur, and his heart ached for her.   ONE MAN'S WORK.       327 One day not long after his return, he ventured to mention Mrs. Northam's name to his sister in a tone of studied indifference. "Dear me! her marrying a rich old man didn't pay well in the end," was Mrs. Gresham's answer, with a little indifferent pity in her voice. "'What do you mean, Julia?" "Why, M{r. Northam failed more than two years ago. The thing took every body by surprise, and proved to be one of those utter, absolute failures which there is no retrieving; for the man had gone into speculations, in such a rash, headlong manner, that he could not have possessed his senses: Anx- iety and agitation brought a fit of apoplexy, and a month after he was a ruined man Benjamin Nor- tham was a dead one!- He left his wife, and his son of a year old, without a dollar; so those who knew affirmed. The house and furniture were sold; Mrs. Northam went into the country; and her brother, who had just left college, accompanied them. I presume she's living in obscurity some- where." Cleveland King mentally resolved that he would know where, some day. He doubted whether Mrs. Northam needed any pity, and whether she had not been relieved to step from her lonely splendor into "obscurity." "My little boy, you must wait for the currants to get ripe."   328      ONE MAN'S WOREK. "Will that be to-morrow?" asked the child, look- ing up wistfully in his mother's face, and withdraw- ing his small hand that was like a white, full-blos- somed lily, from betwixt the pickets, inside of which the currant bushes stood in a dark-green row. "Not to-morrow, nor next day, my boy, but in a couple of weeks, perhaps, the currants will begin to turn red, and look like the small rubies in mamma's brooch." It was a clear, sweet voice that spoke these words, and a caress interpenetrated them all. The lady who spoke them had a small, graceful figure, in a simple white dress, and her straw hat was trimmed with black bands of velvet. The child by her side was a dimpled, bright, restless, rosy little creature, with curls of deep yellow gold, and eyes of a kind of mellow brown, full of the sweetness and joy of childhood-just one of those children which you feel an irresistible impulse to take up in your arms and deluge with caresses. It happened that a gentleman who was stopping for a few days at the single hotel in the little coun- try town of Woodside, for quiet and mountain air, was on horseback that June-morning, and the sight of the young mother and her child attracted him, for he had a singularly-fine perception of all beauti- ful things. The feet of his horse made no sound in the soft, sandy road; and when the gentleman had heard the lady's sweet, vibrant voice, his curiosity to get a glimpse of her face was strengthened; he   ONE MAN S WOREK.      329 wondered within himself whether it completed the harmony of the figure and voice. The lady stopped before the gate of the small, pleasant little cottage, with some graceful larches drooping in front. "There, my boy, we've got home once more!" The gentleman spurred his horse, for the moment when she should turn to close the gate would be his chance; she dropped her child's hand, and the little fellow taking advantage of his brief liberty darted out into the road, and was the next moment close to the hoofs of the gentleman's horse. He gave a little shriek of affright, the mother turned sharply, the next moment a cry broke from her lips full of fright and agony. "O, my child!" and she darted forward. But the rider was off his horse in a breath. He had lifted the little fellow almost from under the feet of his horse, and he-placed him in his mother's arms, saying: "I assure you, he is not in the least hurt, ma'am." "Thank you, sir; but O, what a narrow  escape, my precious baby!" and for a moment the mother had no eyes, no thought, except for her child. Then she looked up. The stranger was searching her face with startled, intent gaze; a quick surprise and uncertainty startled the blood back into her cheeks, and they both spoke together- "Mrs. Northam!" "Mr. King!" Then she put out her hand with the simple, earn- 28   ONE MAN'S WORK. est grace that she had not lost with her child- hood- " 0, I am glad to see you once more, Mr. King !" and the tears filmed the lady's eyes as she spoke. "I expected to find you some time, but not here and now," said the gentleman, Cleveland King, with a smile that was not on his lips alone. "You will surely come in?-this is our home;" and she glanced at the little cottage, like a white cup rimmed with vines. And as 1he followed the lady Cleveland King thought of that other stately home.where last he had been her guest. The same thought and con- trast must have struck Mrs. Northam too; for she turned toward her guest as they crossed the thresh- old, and with a bright, tremulous smile, that yet had a certain pathos in it, said to him, "It's a very humble home to which I must wel- come you; but 0, it's such a happy one, Mr. King!"    , These four years had gone over her without mark or witness. The girlish, half-wistful look was in her face still, and some new life and hope was there now, too-something which ke had missed before. So they went in together and sat down in the little vine-shaded parlor of the cottage; and the sweet child, tired with his walk and the growing heats of the Summer day, stared at the stranger awhile, then the golden head drooped and finally fell heavy with slumber into his motler's lap.   I   I   'Do you know any thing cf all which has hap- pened to me ?" asked Mrs. Northam; and hel face was solemn, but there was no keen regret in it- how could there be? "Some of all. I heard of your husband's failure and death from my sister, and of your removal into the country."  "Yes; there were several motives which induced us to come here. We wanted the purer country air for my baby; and then it is very cheap living at Woodside, and we manage to get along nicely on Calvin's salary, although it is only eight hundred a year." Her face, in its bright quiet and content, spoke for her-said all that her lips did not-then and there. They had each a good deal to talk over, and Mrs. Northam treated her guest as though he was just what he was - a very dear friend, who would be interested to learn any thing of all which had transpired to her since their last meeting. She told him briefly the particulars of her husband's last illness; and how he had seemed altered, soft- ened, and humbled when his great fortune, whose foundations he thought that he laid so broad and deep suddenly broke from under him; and how kind some of his creditors had proved; and that when the costly furniture of her city home fell under the hammer of the auctioneer, she had saved enough to furnish the pretty little cottage, where, Mrs. Northam   said, the radiance of cheerfulness    332      ONE MAN S WORK. lighting up all her features, "she should be happy to live and die." There was one woman who had had enough of wealth, fashion, splendor, and all these had in no wise harmed her. And Cleveland King glanced around: the small, tasteful parlor, with its relies of other times, and it looked pleasanter to him than all the old splendor of the home where Mrs. Nor- tham had once been his hostess. And he had much to tell; and the lady sat still, and listened eagerly to his bright, animated pic- tures of foreign life and travel; and the June morn- ing slipped through its golden hours into noon, and then Calvin Humphrey came home. Great was the young man's astonishment, varied and deep his emotions on seeing his sister's guest. He- grasped Cleveland's hand and wrung it without any words for a while; at last he spoke- "Our best friend at last! We always think of-. we always speak of you as this!" "And now, gentlemen," said Mrs. Northam, get- ting up with a little gayety of manner, which sat well on her girlish face and figure, "you must en- tertain yourselves for a little while, as I have but one domestic, and my dinner requires some last su- pervision which she can not bestow on it. Edward, my boy, go to your uncle;" for the child was awake at last, and rubbing his sleepy, brown eyes with his small fists. These four years had wrought a great change in   ONE MAN S WORK E.      333 Calvin Humphrey. As Cleveland King looked on him, he thought that he was truly a brother that any sister would be proud of. The slender, student-figure had expanded into manhood; the face had lost its boyish beauty, but it had gained in force, concentration, fixed purpose. Calvin Humphrey had the face of a man who could trust himself, and whom others could trust. When the two gentlemen were alone, the younger said to the elder, "Do you know, sir, that all I am now  all T ever expect to be, I owe to you-to your kindness, which rescued me from the gulf into which I had plunged myself?" "We must agree never to speak of that," an- swered the elder. "Your sister's gratitude repaid me a thousand times for the service I was enabled to render you both." At this moment the child, who had been cu- riously investigating the strange gentleman with his eyes wide for wonder, slipped off from his uncle's knee and drew up to Cleveland with a pretty ap- peal in his face. And the gentleman lifted the boy in his arms and kissed him. And during this inter- view Cleveland King learned that Calvin had, through a friend of his uncle, obtained the situa- tion of tutor in a commercial college a few miles from Woodside, with an annual salary of eight hund- red dollars. "We manage to live very nicely on it," said the   334       ONE MAN S WOREK. young tutor, with a smile. "You can't imagine what a wonderful and economical housekeeper Ellen has developed!" At that moment she put her face, touched with a smile, inside the parlor, and announced dinner. A sweet and wonderful hostess she was at her own table, Cleveland King thought; and her fair, young face had never beamed with such happiness and content,- behind the massive silver in her splendid dining-room, as it did here, seated at her table, under the little cottage roof. Beautiful to the watchful eyes of Cleveland King seemed, too, the love which existed between Mrs. Northam and her brother, so singularly separated from the world, and closely united together. It was a love which, before him, at least, demon- strated itself in no words; but eyes and voices bore to it constant and faithful witness. After the pleas- ant dinner-was over the three came back to the cool, vine-shaded parlor; and there, with a little laugh, Mrs. Northam slipped a skein of embroidery silk over her brother's fingers. "You see, Mr. King, I try to make Calvin use- ful in all small household services, and hope to turn him out a model old-bachelor uncle one of these days," she said. "I find it impossible to tell which looks as if the work was pleasanter-the teacher or the scholar," smiled the guest, looking from the young man to his sister.   ONE 'MAN S WORK.      335 "O, Calvin is the best scholar in the world," said she. Somewhat more added the lady's eyes, looking in her brother's face. "That is because Ellen is the best teacher in the world," answered the brother. "How happy you two must be here alone to- gether!" said Cleveland King, half to himself; and he thought of his own sister, and sighed to himself, but so low that neither his host or hostess caught it. "So happy that the world seems too far off to harm us. We are blessed in our humility--are we not, Calvin?" and the thought shook the tears into Mrs. Northam's eyes. "Yes, Ellen;" and there was more than tender- ness-something of reverence-in the gaze with which Calvin Humphrey answered his sister.  And when the silk had flowed in a white rill away from the young tutor's fingers to his sister's spool, he looked at his watch, and said, "There are two hours, now, of work for me to- day; I should be glad to remain."  And he went away. They watched him from   the window till he was out of sight. "He is the best brother in the world," said -Mrs. Northam, turning to her guest. And Cleveland King thought what he did not say-"Happy is the brother who has such a sister!" He remained at the cottage during most of that day.  They had much to talk over--so much that it was not finished that day, nor any other of the   336      ONE MAN S WORK. days which Cleveland King passed at Woodside, for he did not return to New York till a week after his meeting with Mrs. Northam, and when he did, he felt some new want and restlessness, and his thoughts wandered often to the little cottage that sat like a white basin cosily nestling among the hills at Woodside. So he came back again. He was a sincere, straightforward man, as you know. The second day after his arrival, he invited Mrs. Northam to ride out with him. Among the deep pine woods, filled with a solemn chant, on their way to the sea, Cleveland King told his companion why he had never married: because his heart and soul had never yet found a woman to whom they could say, "We will walk together the time of God's appointment, looking with faith and hope to the end, believing that though it may be well with us here, it shall be better beyond-a true woman- a loving woman-. a Christian woman. Never, did I say? I have found her now. Ellen, you understand me?" She looked up. Many things struggled in her face for mastery; they all broke down into a sob. "Ellen, I know how shamefully you were de- ceived and wronged by one husband; is it because of his memory that you can not trust me?" "O, no, no!'but when I remember the wrong he did me, I remember, too, that he was the father of my child." "And as such we will always speak of him.   ONE MAN 'S WORK.       337 Ellen, may I not be now the father of your child- I pray God a better one than he was?" She nestled up to him; she laid her soft, flutter- ing fingers on his arm; her sweet eyes smiled up into his face full of love- "I will try to be that woman your heart has long sought for, Cleveland," she answered. 29   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH.   SHE, Edna Randolph, opened the door and looked out. It was a cold, chill, bloodless, ashy-faced day. Clouds of a pallid, white gray were drawn thick and tight over the sky, Patches of snow lay in the hollows by the road-side, and on the hills, like breadths of soiled flannel which the winds had torn and the rains had rotted. Certainly there was not much in this day--drooping, baffled, haggard-to give to any soul who went to it for strength, heal- ing, sympathy; and this girl had come to it for help;. and her soul, out of some dumb want, yearn- ing, hunger, made its appeal, and there was no an- swer. She was naturally of a restless, nervous habit, never sitting long at one sort of work, or in one position; of sudden, rapid movements, liking change of physiognomy in her surroundings, and fond of walking in different rooms during the day, and among the long halls where you would be cer- tain to find her, generally with a sweet, bright con- tentment in her face, like one who communed with pleasant thoughts. And a pleasant soul had this girl or woman, just on the borders of her twenty- 339      340   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. fourth Winter, of whom I am now to tell you; a soul gracious, tender, womanly; with a fineness of quality, and a depth of nature, which are bestowed on few, either of men or women. But now, looking on the day, this face of Edna Randolph was- not bright. The vague sadness at the core of her life, that morning, which had start- led her so suddenly from her embroidery, grew deeper and wider, as the increasing mist settled down upon the distant hills. She shivered, looking- off to these, and the tears came large and slow into her eyes. If you had asked her what caused them, she could not have told you, and would probably have fancied it was out of some sympathy with the day, which seemed to her clothed in its sackcloth of clouds, and grieving for its lost sunshine. But Edna Randolph was mistaken here; her tears had some deeper foun- dation than the day. There she stood in the wide,. old-fashioned front door, a woman hardly of middle size, somewhat too slender, with a fair, oval face, all the features finely cut; yet so pale as to give one an impression of delicacy. She was not hand- some; there was not bloom nor warmth enough about her for that. She had eyes of a deep ame- thyst, and a mouth tender, sweet, and which,- though dlosed now, in that sort of grieved way which re- minded you of a little child's, had in it all possibili- ties of smiles. Looking at her in some hours of her life, people                .      *   THE STORY OF EDNA -RANDOLPH.   . 341 had called Edna Randolph beautiful, but they were not hours like this. She was an only daughter, and her father was a farmer in the old town of Woodleaf; a man of the sturdy, old-fashioned New England type; shrewd, in- dustrious, intelligent; a kindly, hospitable, strongly- opinionated old man, who had made his own money, and prided himself on it, and who had settled him- self in the midst of his broad wheat-fields and goodly orchards, to enjoy a ripe, hearty, cheerful old age. Edna's mother had died three years before, and the girl had had that inestimable blessing, the coun- sel and example of a true, noble, Christian mother. Her fine qualities came to her from  this side; but there was added to these somewhat of her father's shrewd, sterling sense, and his strong, sound, practical way of judging men and things. Edna had one brother, two years her senior; a brave, tender, manly nature as hers was womanly. He had just finished his professional studies, for the farmer was a broad-minded, liberal-souled' man, and had spared no-expense in the education of his chil- dren. His son had gone to Yale; his daughter had had the finest advantages which a thorough board- ing-school course could afford. Edna was not an ornamental scholar. - She could appreciate fine music, but she would never have ex- -celled in its execution. She did not waste her time in pretty paintings, in a taste of German, and   342   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. Italian, and French; but whatever she studied, that she studied not for the show, but for the love of it. So at the end of the course she was what so few of her sex are, a fine, well-disciplined scholar, a sincere lover of good books; her heart had kept pace with her intellect; the sweet, tender, womanly sympa- thies, the quick enthusiasm had been strengthened instead of chilled by these years of study. So, on this morning in January, this girl, whose spiritual lineaments I have tried feebly to paint for you, came out on the deep veranda which crossed the whole front of the wide, ample homestead of farmer Ran- dolph-a broad, pleasant 'veranda, sheltering one from sun and rain, and Edna's favorite prome- nade. Edna's life was, on the whole, a very happy one in the old farm homestead. She was her father's pet and idol; spent her time between her books, and care for his comfort-for she devoted several hours of each day to reading and chatting with him; and a niece of his,a childless widow much Edna's senior, had taken Mrs. Randolph's position in the household, thus relieving the girl from all domestic cares. But there were times when the soul of Edna Randolph rose up and protested against this slug- gish life--this life which sometimes seemed to her of one dead tone, wanting in warmth and color, in purpose, activity, in something to enrich and exalt it. It was not singular. Edna Randolph had a   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH.    343 bright, strong, active spirit, which needed some object, idea, purpose, to concentrate and absorb it. Woodleaf was an old town in the western part of the State, half a dozen miles from any depot; and its two centuries gave it a venerable and pictur- esque air, as it sat in the midst of its charming scenery, reminding one of some old English village, wanting only the hawthorn hedges and ivy. And the old town slept quiet and stately amid all the rush and progress of the age, keeping the stately, social forms of a by-gone period, and retaining the old habits of thinking and doing. Edna Randolph was not of the material of which fashionable ladies are made. She did not crave the gayety-and excitement of the city, and she loved that quiet old home among the hills better than any place on earth; and yet it was a necessity of this bright, strong, womanly nature, that it should sometimes repine at its monotonous life; that books should sometimes weary it; and that all the possi- bilities of tenderness, sacrifice, achievement, which slept unfolded within it, should have stirred them- selves into a vague hunger, and yearning, and im- patience. And just now these feelings had made their voice heard with an unusual imperiousness. Edna was exceedingly susceptible to elemental in- fluences, and now the sense of gloom and loss in her soul seemed to respond to the gloom and loss of the day. These seasons/were very unusual with Edna Randolph. She was of too healthful a nature, too   344   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. well poised, and too much inclined to look at -the bright side of things, often to yield to feelings like those which at present possessed her. She walked up and down the veranda, regardless of the cold chill in the atmosphere, and finding some relief in the mere physical movement. And suddenly a couple of young men on horseback spur- red around the sharp curve of the road, and rode directly in front of the house. They both looked up with curiosity at the rapid, graceful figure on the veranda. The exercise had kindled a glow in Edna's cheeks. She wore a morning-dress of some dark, bright woolen, while a frill of lace made a small white surf about her neck--a delicate, picturesque, graceful figure, cut against the gloomy sky. The young men turned and smiled in each other's faces. "I know who that lady is!" said one of them. "Let's see whether you do, old fellow?" "The lady is your sister, Miss Edna Randolph." "Yes, that is Edna," replied the other, glancing up again with eyes full of fondness and pride at the swift figure. Then the two gentlemen spurred their horses. "Edna!" called one of these.  The girl started, turned about with a face full of sudden bewilder- ment; then the roses blossomed out wide and bright in it, the eyes leaped into gladness and tenderness, and to all who might then and there behold, the   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH.     345 latent beauty of the face of Edna Randolph was disclosed. "O, Paul, Paul!" and she put out her arms. The young man was off his horse in a moment, and Edna was drawn into her brother's arms, and kissed on forehead and lips with a fervor which showed what this brother and sister were to each other. Then, as the stranger alighted, Paul Randolph in- troduced him to his sister. His name was not strange, although his face was to Edna, for Philip Denison had been the classmate and dearest friend of her brother. He was the son of a Georgia planter, and the young men were physically a per- fect antithesis to each other. The Northern student was fair, with brown clustering curls of hair, and dark-blue eyes, with a fine, frank, intelligent, thoughtful face; a figure of medium size, which a boyhood of much outdoor life and exercise had de- veloped into muscular force and elasticity. The Southerner was of the same hight, but somewhat slighter built; a dark face, handsomer than his friend's, with a frank smile and a fascinating man- ner; highly cultivated in every respect; impetuous, generous, of quick, sensuous temperament, easily roused to indignation, easily stirred into generous and heroic sentiment; such was the character of Philip Denison, the friend of Paul Randolph. And some tie, deeper than the ordinary associa- tions of college life, drew these young men together;   346   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. for Paul had once been in deadly peril, and his friend had rescued him at the risk of his own life. A party of classmates had gone out one afternoon for a sail. They started with a brisk wind, which gradually grew into a gale. The two small boats were out on the Sound some distance from any land, except a small island, which their only safety depended on their making. Paul was in the smaller boat, and his classmates'resigned the management of the little craft to him. Had he been a less skillful steersman, they must inevitably have foundered. The waves fought and tore themselves' into foam about them, lifting up their arms, and clutching and roaring like wild beasts for their prey, and washing the little crew with their salt agony, as they retired cheated and baffled, and then came thundering back in mighty squadrons, rushing at the little boat, which bent and fluttered and rose, and lived on in the midst of that terrible sea. But just as Paul Randolph rose to give some order, she suddenly lurched on the side where he stood, with such force as nearly to upset her, and when she righted once more Paul was overboard. His terrified classmates saw him rise and strike out boldly for them, and hle had nearly reached the larger boat to which the waves carried him, when she too, lurching on one side, struck him a terrible blow, which took away his breath and his strength. There was no use struggling longer against those   TIIE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH.    347 fearful waves. It was evident that Paul Randolph was going down. Then, Philip Denison, who had watched his friend in white solicitude for his safety, with that gener- ous impulsiveness which was a part of his nature, sprang into the sea, caught his friend, and put out with him for the island, Paul swimming feebly, and half supported by his classmate. It was a terrible struggle, but they reached the land at last. "You have saved my life, Philip," gasped Paul, and then he fell senseless upon the wet beach. The boats, with their half-drowned crew, made the shore at last; not a soul was lost. Paul Ran- dolph was restored after a while. He was not a man ever to forget that his friend had risked his life for him; and so it came to pass that these two, the Southerner and the Northerner, loved each other like brothers. The gentlemen and the lady went together into the house. Of course Edna did not meet this friend and classmate of her brother, the preserver of. his life, with the ordinary courtesy which she would have extended to a stranger.  She had heard so frequently of him for years-his name was so familiar, and linked with so sacred a debt of grati- itude under their roof, that it seemed to her she could find no words in which fitly to embody her welcome to their new guest; but the sweet eyes bore witness for her, as lifting them to Philip Deni- son's face, she said:   E STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. "You are welcome, sir, to our home--welcome as no other friend in the world would be, for Paul's sake." So a hew warmth and color spread themselves over the gray tints of the life of Edna Randolph. She walked no more alone on the veranda when the storms were abroad, and the fogs unfurled their gray tents on the hills. The young men made, of course, new life in the house. - Edna was never lonely where Paul was, and there was always some new'enterprise on hand, or some new topic of con- versation to interest and amuse her. She could not now tell which she enjoyed most, the sunny days or the stormy ones; the days in which they had sleigh rides, or went, after the sunshine had loosened the swaddling bands of snow, into the forest searching for green and gray lichens, and mosses, and swamp berries; or the evenings when they all gathered about the glowing wood 'fires -for the farmer, al- though his house and lands bore witness to the readiness with which he embraced most improve- ments of the age, was inflexible in regard to stoves and furnaces, and here Edna cordially sympathized with her father's preferences. She loved the great, picturesque, glowing tents of flame in the large fire- places, and the rich glow with which they filled the rooms: and so around these great fireplaces there sat three young faces now, full of youth, manliness, earnestness, or the grace and sweetness of woman- hood.; and that elder face, full of the nameless at-   -   I   traction of a good and honorable old age. The talk in these evenings was a pleasant thing to listen to. It glanced on all topics, in its bright desultory way; and it was a banquet at which Edna sat, and her soul feasted. The young students were both men of no ordinary culture; and though widely unlike in temperament and character, they harmonized wonderfully in their views on most of the wide range of topics which came under their discussion. Edna used to watch her father at these times; the silver hairs shining like sea foam about his face; his look of pleased, absorbed attention, as he sat there opening and shutting his eyes, or turning them from his son to his friend, as one or the other took up the conversation. It was a home scene of quiet and content rarely equaled. There was, however, one topic which was at first mutually ignored. That Winter, only two years ago, the cloud which so long had spread murky and threatening along the edges of our political horizon, had now risen over the land till all the people heard the thunderings and the lightnings thereof. We all know how that Winter passed in vague doubt and dread, and fearful glances to the future; how promptness, decision, energy were most want- ing where most they were needed; what confusion, and rage, and threatening filled the councils of our nation; and how true hearts all over the land'asked themselves, "What shall the end of these things  } STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. be?"And the answer was that one appalling thing from which God has not delivered-us. The old farmer had first seen the light in that quiet which followed the Revolution. His father had suffered, his mother had toiled and endured as the men and women of the Revolution did fight and toil for their country, through that long seven years of anguish and sacrifice for her deliverance. And the farmer's boyhood had opened in a social and moral atmosphere, where love to one's country was held next to one's love of God. His native land-her Government, her liberties, her prosperity were dearer to him than his life; and whatever forces struck at these, struck, of course, to the very heart and quick of the old man's life. The love of his country was a part of his nature, ingrained into his very life; and it is needless to add with what feelings -he would receive the barest suggestion of a disruption of that Union which his fathers had bought with their blood, or of the dishonor of that flag whose stars had shone over his childhood, and which had been about his whole life a shield of pro- tection, honor, and glory, and under which he fondly hoped to die. Philip Denison, the young Georgian, was South- ern in his opinions, tastes, and habits; he was of impetuous, fiery nature, quick to take offense, and therefore to give it, when any feature of domestic, social, or political life in the South was disapproved. Still, he had been for several years a resident of   I   the North; and his natural kindliness of heart, and a wide acquaintance in, and knowledge of New England, had somewhat disciplined his vehement nature. The state of the country in that February of eighteen hundred and sixty-one, was certainly an inflammable subject for the old New England farmer and the young Georgian to venture on; but they did at last, not suspecting what widely-different views the discussion would disclose; for Philip Denison was not at that time an advocate of a dis- ruption of the Union. The whole company at first joined in the talk; but Paul, who knew his friend's real sentiments, soon attempted to change the current of conversation. It was too late, however, to arrest it; even Edna was not able to do this, though she brought her woman's tact to the rescue as soon as she discovered the real position of her guest, and had recovered from the consequent astonishment and pain which the knowledge cost her. She knew well enough her father's convictions, and how deeply they had taken root in his soul, and that when his feelings were aroused he would not be held back from speaking all that was in his heart to any man. The conversation grew warm on both sides. In vain Paul and Edna interposed-the old man would not cease the discussion. The farmer grew indig- nant, the guest fiery. Hot words at last passed be- tween them; the one forgot his guest, the other   E STORY OF EDNA RAN DOLPH his host; and thoroughly angered at last, each said some words which, under other circumstances, would have been impossible, and then separated. "Father," pleaded Edna, when her brother and his classmate were gone, "remember he saved Paul's life once." "I know it, child; but those abominable doc- trines--abominable! If he was my own son, I'd rather see him in his grave than have him hold them!" and the old man shook his gray head. And then Edna went to their guest, whom Paul had failed to appease. I do not presume there would seem very much force or argument in what she said, if I should write it here; but she said it in her woman's soft, persuasive way, betwixt smiles and great tears standing still in her eyes; and Philip's proud spirit yielded to these. There were some concessions made on both sides; and so the wound was healed, and the sore topic religiously avoided after this on all sides. That Philip. Denison and Edna Randolph were pleased with, interested in each other, nobody who knew them both could have doubted. The Southerner was a brilliant, fascinating talker, with a fine vein of poetry in his character, and he and Edna were thrown constantly together during these last days of the Winter. The girl loved to listen to her guest's animated, picturesque talk; she responded with all the fervor of her deep, fine nature to much that was honor-   I   able, heroic, and lovely in the character of Philip Denison; her imagination, her womanly reverence and tenderness, did them homage. And so, it came to pass one day that Edna Randolph sat before a revolving stereoscope, which had been her father's gift the previous New-Year, and Philip Denison stood on one side, adjusting the pictures in the case. Edna had become quite absorbed in a view of the Pyramids. The huge, dumb monuments, the still, lonely plains, the steel-blue sky, had all entranced her, and she sat motionless, holding her breath, with fascinated eyes on the strange, somber, wonderful picture. At last with a long sigh, and a little half-apologetic smile for her silence, she drew up her head. Philip Denison had taken a chair by her side, and sat watching her, and waiting. "What a strange, subtile, mysterious attraction there is about this ancient land of Egypt!" said the lady. "Yes; but Miss Edna, it is not of that ancient land, but of the new and present one, that I want to talk with you now; a talk, too, that must be our last alone, for to-morrow I depart from Woodleaf." Surprise, pain, mastered the lady's face. "I thought I thought you would wait till Paul left next week," she said. "I wish I could; but my uncle, from Georgia, will be in the city to-morrow night, and I must meet him there. I am sorry to go." 30   354   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. "I am sorry to have you," responded, sweet, and sad, and steady, the voice of the lady. "But, Miss Edna, my regret is not of that ordi- nary kind which I should experience on leaving a pleasant home where I had been entertained with most kindly and gracious hospitality, and enjoyed the society of a fair and charming hostess. I am going away with a regret such as I never experi- enced before, which takes hold of the quick and center of my life." She knew what was coming then; she sat very still, only her loud heart seemed to choke her. And Philip Denison sat still a moment, and then he said, "Edna, you know what I mean?" She--this woman of whom I write-v-as above any affectations and pretty sophistries of word or deed at such a time. She said, softly, "Yes." "And do you love me?" "I don't know-- I think probable-- I am afraid I do," in a rapid, stammering way; just as the thought was in her heart, so it came to her lips. "Afraid, Edna!" and now he leaned over to her side. !"You know," she said, "there is a great barrier betwixt us." "Edna, is that all?" he asked. "Yes--all," she answered. "Our hearts can surmount that," answered Philip   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH.    355 Denison, speaking with a glad triumph out of the joy of his heart. The lady shook her head. "I am afraid," she said again. "They might once have done this; but now things seem drifting toward a point which will render it necessary for every man to take his stand deliberately, absolutely on one side or the other; and you, Philip, in tastes, habits, life, every thing, are a Southerner, as I am a Northerner." "And do I love you the less for that?" he said, with a quick reproach in his tones. "Perhaps not, Philip; and yet if it should come, as so many fear--as God forbid--to civil war, where will you be?" "Edna! why should we talk of these things?- why should they enter into our love? Are we not both Unionists?" "You call yourself that, Philip-forgive me. You are not a man to use words which do not mean facts: you are one now--and for me. I love the North, I love the South; for both are my country;" and her face outsprang into that radiance which, in moments of great fervor and exaltation, was given it, to interpret her soul--"and I love better than my own life, or any thing it could offer me, that old, dear flag for which my fathers suffered and died. That cluster of stars is the sign and wit- ness to me of the freedom, the religion, the honor, the glory of my fatherland. Under its blessed folds   E STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. my eyes first saw the light; it has held-God bless it!--its strong and tender guardianship about all my life; I have never known a happiness or a joy outside of it that I did not in some way owe to it; and I love it, Philip, with a love which em- braces all the gratitude, all the heroism, all that is fine and sweet and tender in association, with all that is best and truest in me." He looked at her in mingled admiration and ten- derness. He was of soul fine enough to appreciate the spirit of sacrifice and patriotism. Her enthu- siasm magnetized him. "So do I love the old flag," he answered. "But, alas! not so well as you love a part of it, I fear. If your own State should set herself in deadly strife against it, where would you be found?" "I should still remain, I believe, in heart and sen- timent a Unionist," answered Philip Denison; but the heart of the woman detected some want of- fervor in his tones. "You believe-ah, Philip, I could not trust you!" and she sat down, bursting into passionate tears; and even Philip Denison did not suspect what anguish there was in them. He tried to comfort her;- he told her she had lived there alone with her old father, and listened to his talk till she was almost beside herself on this subject; and with strong, sweet, persuasive elo- quence, he besought her not to let this matter blight the lives of both-to give him some word or   I   token which he could carry with him out into the world whither he was going. And partly per- suaded, and only partly--for it was an inevitable necessity of. this girl's truth and honesty, that she must look all facts straight in the face, and could not turn aside from them and deceive her soul- she looked up in his face and smiled a sweet smile, a tender one, but full of doubt and sadness. "And do you love me well enough to be my wife, O, Edna?" "I could, Philip, if"- "There, now, not another word of that! I'm not going to have any 'if' in the matter. None shall stand in our way." But he could not move her into completing her sentence otherwise; and so he said it should stand so. He was full of hope and ardor himself, which hardly communicated itself in any degree to Edna; yet she could not find it in her heart to darken the hope for this man whom she loved, and who would be her lover. And in a little while Paul and her father came in, and the conversation went on widely- different topics from the one which had engrossed Philip and Edna for an hour. Afterward they had only time for a short walk. At the lady's urgent entreaty it was agreed that nothing at that time should be communicated to her father or brother; but Philip was to return South, and in the Autumn he anticipated making another visit to Woodleaf; and then he should solicit of the father what he   358'   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. z had of the daughter. Meanwhile they would rite to each other. And so they separated; and Philip Denison went away with his heart full of love, and hope, and triumph; and Edna, she went to her own room, and looked off to no warm, bright perspective of her future-it was full of clouds, and gloom, and fear.  The clouds seemed to gather lower and darker over the land; and the man of her love-where would he be when the hour of trial came? But- her face carried its old smile before her father, and he and Paul little guessed the ache of the heart beneath it. Poor Edna! We all know what followed in a little while- the attack on Fort Sumter,-the rush of the nation to arms. When the call for volunteers first reached him, Paul lRandolph waited-waited several months for his father's and his sister's sake, before he spoke; and at last he said to them as they sat together one evening in the late Summer, "Father-Edna, if it were not for you I should go to the help of my country now; but it is not in my heart to do this against your will; and if you tell me to stay I shall do it."' And they did not say it, and Paul Randolph went, three weeks later, the captain of a Woodleaf company, and the blessings and prayers of his father and his sister followed him.   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH.    359 Six months passed. It was the opening of March, a night of wind and snow, and the "wild white bees of Winter"-were swarming thick in the air, driven to and fro by the fierce gusts which swept over the hills into the valley, where lay the home of farmer- Randolph. The lights and the evening papers had just been placed on the table; for the evening mail had just arrived an hour before, and Edna and her father came in from supper; for it was now her usual time to read to the old man for an hour. She tore away the wrappers with her quick fingers a little nervously; for the thought of Paul was always, if possible, closer to her heart at this time. "Is there any news from the war, my daughter?" "Yes," running her eyes over the damp columns; "there has been a terrible battle, and we have taken Fort Donelson;" and then, with a chill at her heart, she turned toward the list of the " wounded and killed." "O, father!" -the paper fell from her hands, and the face of Edna Randolph was like the snow which blanketed the earth outside. She had seen Paul's name there, "dangerously wounded!"Poor Edna! Even in that hour of awful calamity she did not forget her father. There was no need after that sudden cry that she should tell him. He knew all. But with her white, working   X face she crept toward him, and put her arms about his neck.   360   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. "Is he dead?" came in a husky whisper from the old man's ashen lips. "No; but dangerously wounded!" And then the old man's anguish leaped out from his heart to his lips, as David the king's did, and exclaimed in his agony: "O, Paul, O, my son, my pride, my first born!" Two days they waited; then the tidings came; there was no more fear, no more waiting now. Paul Randolph was dead! 'A month went by--O, hearts stricken like theirs throughout the land, you can best tell how-and again Edna and her father sat together. They did not leave each other' often now; and for his sake the girl kept down her own anguish, and told the broken-hearted old man, that after all, there was much of comfort and blessing in this death of Paul; that he had laid down his young, brave, heroic life for his country's sake; and that his name, too, was among the dead-the noble, the honorable, the glorious dead! And the old man's lips would search for a faint smile, and he would say, "Bless you, my daughter!" in tones which did Edna's broken heart good. They had not brought in the lights that night; she had waved them back from the door, for the full mioon was looking in at the windows and spilling over the room its streams of silver, and filling it with its white, solemn radiance. Edna and her father sat there for an hour, it might be, in utter silence. Then she went up to her father and put her arms   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH.    361 around his neck in the old way, and there was a mute appeal in the movement. "What is it, my daughter?" "Father," she said, "I am tired of this life --of this slow, inactive, wearing life, with its leaden hours, and its great-loss and grief eating into my soul. I want to do some work, to render some serv- ice for my country. Surely God has not appointed me to sit down with folded hands in the sackcloth and ashes of my desolation. I must work or I shall die. Father, let me go to the hospitals at Wash- ington, and do what I can there for my sick and wounded countrymen!" And her father answered: "You shall go, my daughter, but not alone. I can not stay here in the old house without either of my children. I will go with you, to watch over and shelter you as only a father can." And Edna's soft, warm hand dropped amid her father's hair, white as the snows of the last Winter. "I felt you would say that," she said, "and I felt, too, it would be better for both of us." So the father and daughter went away, and the pleasant house at Woodleaf was left silent and de- serted. Three months have passed. The June sunshine looks into the long rows of windows, and the winds which have the musky fragrance of the Summer, wander softly over the long rows of beds, upon which lay the sick, the wounded, and the dying. 31   362   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. And over the beds, and moving softly in their midst, were the tender, pitying faces, the soothing, ministering hands of women--women, to whom those dim eyes and pallid faces looked up as the eyes of little children look up to the faces of their mothers. And here Edna Randolph had come, and here she had worked faithfully-faithfully by night and by day.  She had bathed many a face flushed with hot fever, till the sick man, with the fire in his brain, and the race in his pulse, babbled of mountain snows, and the plash of cool streams by his own door; and her sweet smile, her soft, pitying voice had cheered and comforted the heart of many a sick soldier, and the hand of the dying had grown cold in her grasp, and she had caught the last, faint whisper of those who would never speak in this world again. But this June morning the nurses were more busy than usual; for many fresh invalids had been received the night before; and Edna was passing to her appointed service, when a low groan from a couch close at hand on her right, suddenly attracted her attention. She turned; a sharp, white face lay there, with closed eyes and ashen lips pressed tightly together-- the face of a young man, a fine, intelligent, forcible face, which any where must have attracted you. But with the first glance the heart of Edna Ran- dolph sprang till it fairly choked her, and she stag- gered back, gasping and faint. But the next she   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH.    363 leaned forward, and the dying man suddenly opened his eyes. They met hers. "Edna!" "Philip!" So they met-these two who parted more than friends nearly a year and a half before. She had heard from Philip Denison only a few times after he had left Woodleaf, and his letters were the manly, tender, ardent letters of a man to the one woman he loved best on earth. Then he had returned to his home, the mails had stopped, and Edna had learned no more-only she feared. The young Southerner put out his hand, and she took it in both of hers, and her living face was white as his dying one. "O, Philip, to meet you here, and so!" she said. He looked at her, the words struggled up to his lips- "Where is Paul?" "In heaven, we humbly trust," answered Edna Randolph. And Philip Denison groaned, and wrenched his hand from hers, and covered his face. A .new fear shook Edna from head to foot. "O, Philip, say it was not you-say it was not you!" she cried. "It was 1, Edna. We met foes on the battle- field. I did not know him till I had. struck the blow and seen him fall, and then I was borne away by the rush of men, and I could not learn whether   364   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH. he was wounded or dead--I, who would have died in his stead, and once risked my life to save his." And having made his confession, Philip Denison looked up in her face. Poor Edna! But she had not left his bedside; she was standing there still. Something in her face made him say, "Edna, can you forgive me?" And in a moment she answered, "I forgive you, as Paul would." A smile struggled out on Philip Denison's face. He sought for her hand. '0, Edna, I can die in: peace now!" She bent down and kissed the cold forehead. "Edna," he whispered, "I have loved you through it all." "I knew you did, Philip, because I did you." She slipped her arm under his head. "Is there no hope for you, Philip?" "None; the ball struck me two days ago, near my heart." The words came husky and difficult. The dying soldier's eyes grew dim. She bent nearer to him. He looked up in her face, and the old smile of Philip Denison struggled out on his lips. "O, Edna, I thank God that he sent you here to let me die looking on your face, just as though you were my very own wife!" And Edna thanked God then, out of all the ach- ing and anguish of her heart. His face was falling into the coldness and calmness of death. His lips   THE STORY OF EDNA RANDOLPH.    365 moved. She put down her wet cheek a little closer to his lips, and the last prayer of Philip Denison was breathed into her ear. It was, "God be mer- ciful to me a sinner!" and with that most fitting prayer the soul of Philip Denison went out, Edna hoped, into the warmth and welcome of the home, where there shall be "no more war."    "NATHAN! NATHAN!" AN OLD MAN'S STORY. "NATHAN! NATHAN!" Sixty years ago this very day, the voice-the soft, tender, thrilling voice of my mother-came across the wide pasture lot and into the field, where I had been busy all day gathering up cornstalks and making bonfires, which, as I was just outside of my fourteenth birthday, I enjoyed like any frolic. I looked up, and there stood my mother, in her checked apron and snowy "short-gown," shading her eyes with her hands; and though I am an old, old man now, and the brown curls which fluttered thickly about my forehead then, are a few strag- gling locks, white as fresh snow on the tops of the mountains, still that picture of my mother, standing at the lot bars, hangs itself over threescore years, and shines down brightly into my memory now; and the voice comes down, through its long path of green Summers and white Winters, without losing one tone or inflection, and stirs my heart yet with its motherly sweetness-"Nathan! Nathan!" 367   368      "NATHAN! NATHAN!" I had just laid a light branch at the foot of a huge- pyramid of brushwood and cornstalks, when my mother's voice came through the stillness and the spicy fragrance of the May afternoon, and I stopped for a moment to see the mass .ignite, and then hurried across the pasture lot opposite our house-our old, ample, yellow farm-house, whose foundations had been laid by my grandfather before the Revolution. "What is to pay, mother?"I asked, as I panted up to her, for her face was full of perplexity and annoyance. "The minister's come!"She paused a moment after making this announcement, so that it might have due weight and impressiveness with me, and then she went on: "I never was so flustrated in my born days. Your father's three miles off at Rye Neck, pullin' stumps; and Jerushy started off right after dinner, to help Thankful Turner get ready for. her quiltin' to-morrow. "It seems there was some mistake in the message he, sent to your father, and Mr. Willetts was to come Thursday instead of next Tuesday, as we ex- pected. I have n't had my front-room curtains done- up, and I had dreadful poor luck with my last bakin'-Miss Morgan's emptyin's was, to my mind, a little turned-and I r'ally felt as though I should like to have the floor open and swallow me up, when I went to the door, and there stood the sprucest-looking young man I've sot my .eyes on   NATHAN! NATHAN!"       369 for many a day; and says he, with jist the winnin'est smile, 'Does Deacon Cummins reside here, ma'am?' 'Yes, sir, but he's out now,' I said, wonderin' who he could be. But he soon 'satisfied me, for he answered, 'It's Mr. Willetts, the new minister, ma'am.' " "What did you do then, mother?"I said, in a deeply-sympathetic frame of mind, for I was the only son of a New England deacon, and I had been educated with all that, reverence and awe of the clerical profession, which was so deeply ingrained into the social and -religious life of our Puritan ancestors. "I was dreadfully taken down, but I asked him to walk in, and I showed him up -to the spare chamber. I put on the valance last week, and sanded the floor fresh this very mornin'; and then I started straight for you, and it won't do for me to stand here talkin' another minit." "Wall, mother, what is it you want of me? I jist wish the parson had kept away till next Thursday, and not! come botherin' us at jist the wrong time," I continued, angrily stripping a tall mullen stalk of its broad leaves, for I in no wise relished the idea of being called from making bonfires to waiting on ministers. "Hush, my son! Your father wouldn't like to hear you talk in that way of havin' a minister un- der our roof." But I had an intuition that my mother's honest sentiments respecting the parson's   370      "NATHAN! NATHAN!" advent fully concurred with my own, though of course she would not express them as I did. "And now, Nathan, I want you to be as spry as a lark, and catch a chicken and kill it, and I 'm in hopes to have it picked and a-bilin' afore the parson leaves his room; then you must tackle up Major, and then you must go over to' Four Corners to Mrs. Turner's, and bring Jerushy home in double-quick time. It won't do to waste another minit talkin'. Now, Nathan, do n't let grass grow under your feet." My mother started for the house, and I for the barn-yard, with no very amiable emotions toward the parson; and as I could not vent my indignation on that individual himself, I managed to make a small dog, which ran across my path, the innocent victim of my wrath, by striking him with a stone, which sent him limping and yelling away. The chicken was soon decapitated, and by the time I had harnessed Major I was in a better frame of mind, and a brisk ride of half an hour brought me to the red farm-house, facing two of the four roads which had christened the left wing of the old, straggling town of Greenfield. Streams of laughter poured in silvery currents through the open cham- ber-windows, and seemed like a sweet tune set to that jubilant May afternoon, for she stood arrayed in garments fairer than those of "Solomon in all his glory"-garments which the marvelous looms of the sunshine and the early rains had woven for her,   "NATHAN! NATHAN!       371 and embroidered the robe with dandelions, and seamed it with sweet wild violets, and overshot it with white clover. I was a boy then, and the aesthetic element had had little stimulant -or cultivation in the cool, brisk, practical life amid which my boyhood blossomed; but I felt the voice and language of that May after- noon; and the silvery, careless laughter of the girls in the chamber overhead filled my heart like a chime of bells, as I reined up and tied my horse to the old post in front of the Widow Turner's dwelling. I struck the brass knocker, and Jerusha put her head out of the chamber window; and in all the town of Greenfield no sweeter face could have been seen than that of my sister, Jerusha Cummins, as it framed itself in the old brown window-casing that Spring afternoon. So young, so fresh, so full of health and bloom it was, with smiles lurking in the wide blue eyes, and dimpling archly the cheeks, in which carnations were set, that you could not choose but love it at the first glance; and about it, like a fitting frame, lay the thick, silky, dark hair, full of golden lights and heavy shadows. "Nathan .Cummins, I'd like to know what in the world has brought you over here?" exclaimed my sister, in a tone where surprise and apprehension struggled together, for it was evident she feared that I had come with a summons for her to return home, O   372     S   TAAN! NATHAN!" and was alar lest some untoward event had made it necessary., "Let me come up stairs and I'll tell you," for the merriment in the front chamber had stimulated my boyish curiosity. "Well, hurry up, then;" and I was not slow in obeying this injunction, although I knew very well that I was the bearer of very unwelcome tidings. There were some half dozen girls scattered about the great, old-fashioned chamber, in the center of which stood the quilt, inclosed in the long frames; and on one side of the sheet of white and pink patchwork stood Jerusha, a ball of chalk in one hand and a cord in the other, with which imple- ments she and the bride elect were bestowing a border of "shell pattern" around the margin of the quilt, while two others were working the corner scallops-and Mrs. Turner, a little, dumpy, keen- eyed woman, was stoning raisins, with the assist-- ance of two others of Thankful's young friends. My first glance took in all these things, while there was a general cessation of fingers and tongues, and every eye was bent on me, as I delivered my errand. "Jerushy, Parson Willetts has just come to our house, and mother's in an awful stew, 'cause, father's at the Neck, and wants you to come home right straight off!" "O, that's too bad!" was the regretful chorus which followed my announcement.   "NATHAN! NATHAN!"      373 "I jist wish the parson had kept away till I'd got my quilt marked, Jerushy," said Thankful Turner, a pretty girl of twenty, whose face re- peated her mother's, softened and tinted with bloom., "I wish so too," subjoined Jerusha, the corners of her pretty mouth deepened-into a pout. ' We'd jist got a goin' nicely with these shells, and I meant to have got round the quilt before sundown, and now I must leave it. I wonder, for my part, why the parson did n't see far enough to keep away this perticerler afternoon, at least. It's right down provokin' to think of," added Thankful Turner. "Girls! girls!" interposed Mrs. Turner, with an objurgatory shake of the head. "I can't allow a minister of the Gospel to be talked of in that 'ere fashion." "I was havin' such a good time," said Jerusha, as she tied on her bonnet, and tried to keep the tears of vexation out of her blue eyes. "And now I've got to go home and sit before Parson Willetts, as prim and' starch as though it was an awful sin to smile, and a laugh outright was too dreadful a thing to be thought of. I never could get on with minis- ters, any how." This was scarcely surprising, for the few gray- haired, solemn-visaged representatives of the profes- sion, who visited at our house, would not be apt- to enlist the very wArm sympathies or admiration of a   "NATHAN! - NATHAN!" young girl, impulsive, and overflowing with life and spirits, like my sister, Jerusha Cummins. "Jerushy, I am afeared if your heart was in jist the right place, you would n't be so set agin minis- ters," added Mrs. Turner, "and I must say it, sorry as I feel to have you leave us at this time." And the little woman was right: and Jerusha lived to seeit--lived to separate the outward con- ventional sanctimoniousness from the inward heart and spirit, and then she found in those old Puritan ministers the elements of a true, strong, honest manhood; she felt the spirit of submission to God, and love to man, which was the grand ruling pur- pose of their lives-she understood their self-sacri- fice, their devotion; she honored the steadfast zeal which counted all things but loss for the knowledge and the approval of Him whom they served, as being invisible; while all honors, and potentates, and powers, all fashions of this world faded into insignificance before that one mightiest message, which they believed the King of kings had or- dained them to deliver unto men. Jerusha and I hardly spoke to each other on our way home. My sympathy in her disappointment by no means increased my stock of good-will for the minister; but I obtruded my share of our mu- tual trial on her attention, though, I presume, it shrank into very small proportions by the side of her own gigantic trouble. "I sha' n't get my field clearednow afore father   I   comes home. I'd jist got a heap blazin' when mother called me off, to kill a chicken afore I started for you." "Do you hush up, Nathan," exclaimed Jerusha, in tones one would hardly have recognized. "I'm too exasperated to speak about it." "Wall, Jerushy, it's amazin' the time you've took to get here," began mother, as she met us at the kitchen door, with a very red face, and a very flurried manner. "I've jist been in a perfect fever for the last hour." Jerusha did not condescend to make any reply. She walked into the. room next to the parlor, with a look of settled resignation on her fair face, and removed her bonnet; and I helped her set out the table. Then mother bustled into the room. "I want you to get down the pink cheeny and rub up the old silver cream-pot," she said. "I must have some of my best preserves on the table-them in the yaller jar, I did up in loaf sugar last Fall. Why, what ails you, Jerushy!" for, looking up, our mother saw the cloud which darkened the fair face of the child. Then Jerusha's pent-up disappointment and vexa- tion broke out, unable longer to control themselves. "I should think there was matter enough!" she exclaimed, as she shook out the folds of the linen table-cloth my mother had spun before her mar- riage. "When I'm sent for, as though it was a   376      "NATHAN! NATHAN!"  matter of life and death, to get supper for some old blind parson that don't know enough to keep from bothering folks' lives out, I 'm free to' say that I haven't got a spark of patience left. I'd like to know how Thankful Turner's to get along with her quilt; for nobody else knows the round-shell pat- -tern, and the whole thing'll be sp'iled; and the quiltin' 's coming off to-morrow, and she to be mar- ried a week later, and I to be bridesmaid. I s'pose, though, a parson's supper's of so much more im- portance than common folks' quiltin's and weddin's, that they're not to be mentioned in the same day." "Jerushy! Jerushy!" said mother, in a tone of solemn warning. "I can't help it," bestowing the pink china cups on the waiter.- "It's the most aggravatin' thing that -ever happened in my born days. I'm bound not to sleep this night afore I've got that double border of shells on Thankful Turner's quilt. But I must say that I never knew a minister that did n't come at jist the wrong time. It's a faculty they have; and bein' a deacon's daughter, I can speaks from experience." "Jerushy," interposed mother, "I ,never heard you go on so in my born days! - What would your father say to hear you talk in that style? It is n't a week since he told me that it was one of the strongest desires of his heart to see you the wife of a parson!"  "Catch me!" exclaimed Jerusha, with a toss of   "NATHAN! NATHAN!"       3" her pretty head, and a fresh blossoming of the car- nations in her round cheeks. "I 'll live and die an old maid first." Our mother gave a groan at this exhibition of her daughter's obduracy; but a loud sputtering from the "spider" in the kitchen, where the chicken was frying, took her suddenly off, and Jerusha turned to me, saying, "Nathan, you jist go to the best room closet, and bring me the yaller jar on the second shelf, and mind you don't break it. Boys are al'ays so clumsy." There was only a small front "entry" separating the room in which my sister was preparing'tea, and the one which was only used on state occasions; and as I entered the latter I was almost paralyzed ' by seeing a young man sitting in the great arm- chair by the window, one cheek resting on his hand, while an amused smile was hiding itself about his mouth, combated by an expression of some an- noyance. He 'was tall and slight, and his thin, thoughtful, handsome face suited the figure. His eyes and hair were a dark brown, and he must have been several years this side of thirty. It flashed into my mind like lightning that this was the young parson, and that he must have heard every word my sister had spoken; for her voice was raised, and the doors of both rooms were stand- ing ajar. I stood still, too overwhelmed to utter a word, or move hand or foot; but the young minister came 32   378     "u NATHAN! PNATHAN!" o          a straight forward and took my hand, and said, with a smile, which'gave a new warmth and beauty to his pale, handsome face, "I am very glad to see you, my boy! I came down stairs about five min- utes ago, and hope I am not'intruding here." I attempted to answer Parson Willetts, but the words died in my throat. I think that he pitied my confusion, understanding perfectly the cause of it; for he asked, "Are you in quest of any thing here?" "I want the yaller jar in the closet," I sta'm- mered.  - He went toward it and opened the door, while I o followed like one in a dream; but the shelf was too high, and at that moment my sister's voice floated in to me, "Nathan, are you staying to help yourself to the preserves first'?" "Let me assist you," said the parson, and h-e reached down the small earthen jar, and,placed it in my, hands, and this tihre there was a smile on his lips, which his eyes repeated. I hurried back to my sister, who was just dispos- ing the knives and forks around the table, in a more composed frame of mind after her ebullition of irri- table feeling. "Jerushy," I gasped, "the parson's in the parlor, and he's overheard every word you've said!" She gave me a look of bewilderment and fright, and the blossoms grew small in her cheeks. She started toward the door, scarcely conscious of o           t  o   tNATHAN! NATHAN!"       379 what she was doing, but anxious to satisfy herself of the truth of my statement. The young minister had gone to the table to ex- amine some volumes which lay there, and so Jerusha did not see 'him till she had advanced into the room, when the young man turned and confronted her. It would not be an easy matter to depict the pitiable confusion of Jerusha Cummins at that moment. She had conceived Parson Willetts a typ- ical representative of the stately old Puritan min- ister-stiff, solemn, dignified; and when she saw the young parson, with his handsome, scholarly face and courteous bearing, and recalled the feelings she had expressed regarding his inopportune visit, and her general opinions respecting his profession, all power of speech forsook her; and with her sweet, young face covered with blushes and making it look pret- tier than ever, she stood dumb before the minister. He attempted to set her at ease. "This is Dea- con Cummins's daughter, I presume?" he said. "There is no need of my introducing myself." Jerusha tried to answer, but the words would not leave the poor girl's quivering lips; instead of which there came a sob; and breaking down into tears and mortification, Jerusha buried her face in her hands and sank into a chair. "Now, Miss Cummins, I beg you won't give yourself a moment's unhappiness about any thing to which I may have been an unintentional listener. I made all the noise I could to attract your atten-   380     ' "NA-THAN! NATHAN!" tion, and was debating whether I had better an- nounce myself by closing the door, which you must have seen me do, when your brother entered. I regret very much that you should have been sum- moned home on my account; but, being neither very old, .nor very gray-haired, I shall not include myself in that list of my brethren who have been so unfortunate as to have incurred your dis- like." Jerusha lifted her tearful face at these words. She saw the smile which lurked in the minister's eyes, and being herself a young person of uncon- trollable risibles, and keen sense of the ridiculous, she burst out into a quick, leaping, laugh, in which Parson Willetts heartily joined. The. laugh reached our mother, who had just placed her platter of fried chicken, done to the or- thodox brown, in the center of a table flanked with a mound of smoking biscuit and a pyramid of tempt- ing crullers, with preserves and tumuli of black- berry jam, all delicious enough to allure the appe- tite of any mortal, whether minister or otherwise. She went to the door and looked into the parlor, but the minister and Jerusha were not within her range of vision, and she turned back to me with an expression of great bewilderment on her face. "What' does it all mean, Nathan?" she asked; for I was standing near the door. "O, nothing much, only Parson Willetts and Je- rushy are having a little joke together."    I   {"NATHAN! NATIIAN!"      381 "Seems to me they've got acquainted in mighty quick time"--pouring the cream into the cups pre- paratory to announcing the supper. But, at that moment, father entered the room, and was at once informed of our guest's arrival, Of course he was not long in welcoming the min- ister, as mother was in great trepidation lest her chicken; and coffee should get cold. I shall never forget that first supper of Parson  Willetts at our house. It was as much as Jerusha or I could do to keep a straight face on while the blessing was being asked; but we both got sobered as father and Parson Willetts went into a long con- versation on the state of the Church, the prospects of the crops that harvest, the sudden death of Par- son Minor, after being settled for "up'ard of fifty years" over the South Presbyterian Church, in the town of Greenfield; and the inauguration of the new President. At last, in some pause which slipped into their conversation, the minister said, glancing from my sister's face to my mother's, "Your daughter re- sembles you strikingly, Mrs. Cummins." "Yes," answered my father, glancing at the little pale-faced woman who sat at the head of the table, with an expression. which said he saw her still in the "first blossoming of her womanhood," when her cheeks were like the meadow roses she used to wind in her hair. "Jerushy's thte complete picture of what her mother was at nineteen; and as for Nathan   382'     "NATHAN! NATHA  N!" here, he's a reg'lar chip of the old block--all Cum- X mins, and not a bit of Warner in him." I looked at my father, the strong-built, muscular, stalwart, sun-burnt farmer that he was, and won- ldered if I should ever be like him. "Nathan," said my father, as he rose from the table, "you and Jerry must milk the cows this evenin', and then I want you to step over to Squire Platt's and tell him I'll call to-morrow and see about takin' that yoke of oxen." "You can take Squire Platt's in the way when you come home from  Four Corners," interposed mother; " for you must carry Jerushy right back to Mrs. Turner's. Never mind the dishes, Jerushy, I'll do all the chores; for it won't do to have Thankful Turner's weddin' quilt sp'iled." "I should like to take a look at some part of the town of Greenfield," said the young minister; "and with your permission, Miss Cummins, I will save your brother the trouble of carrying you over to the Four Corners." "Thank you, sir. I should be much pleased to have you," answered Jerushy, betwixt a blush and a smile; and she went after her bonnet, and her mother followed and entreated her to "behave steady, and remember she was in a minister's com- pany, and'not go to cuttin' up any of her jokes." "He looks pretty young," said my father to my mother, as he returned from the " barn-gate," which he had just closed after the wagon which con-   "NATHAN! NATHAN!"      383 tained the minister and Jerusha; "but he seems a sound-minded, well-eddicated, pious young man; and it isn't al'ays in age that wisdom resides. I hope if he comes among us that his labors will be greatly blessed." "I hope so, Richard," she said. "I must say I took a fancy to him from the first; he's such a pleasant-spoken, handsome-faced young man." "Fine feathers don't make fine birds al'ays, mother," said father, taking out his weekly news- paper. "Wall, you didn't say so once, Nathan Cum- mins, when you went down to the old fort every Wednesday and Sunday night," retorted my mother, with a smile which brought back something of the lost beauty of her youth to her face. What reply father made I never knew; for at- that moment I caught sight of our "hired man," who was driving the cows home from pasture; and seizing my cap I rushed after them. The "round shell border" was achieved, although Jerusha had to sit up till " nigh upon one o'clock," and averred that she was, in consequence, a perfect fright at the quiltin' next day. But, as nobody else concurred in that young lady's opinion respecting her personal appearance, I am inclined to think it was only one of those slight ex- pansions of the truth, in which her sex are so apt to indulge. I know that every body said they had a lively   384   "   NATHAN! NATHAN! time at widow Turner's, and I have j the best of reasons for supposing the sudden advent of the new minister was duly commented on; and that his personal appearance, and all sorts of speculations embracing his attachments and future relations, al- ternated with gossip and jests about the wedding which was to transpire the next week. My sister was Thankful Turner's bridesmaid, and Mr. Wil- letts performed the marriage ceremony, and looked, so some of the younger portion of the guests de- clared, as though he would have liked very much to join in some of the plays which always accom- panied a wedding in those days, if his profession had not -interdicted it. The following Summer Mr. Willetts was duly in- stalled as pastor of the South Presbyterian Church of Greenfield; and although there was some slight dissent among the older members on account of his youth, still I know that Mr. Willetts was regarded by most of his congregation as a young man of ex- ceeding promise; and theylaffirmed that no sermons ' had ever issued from the pulpit of the South Pres- byterian Church like' those which were heard every Sunday from the lips:of Parson Willetts; and I may be permitted to add. here my own testimony, founded on years of most intimate, personal friendship with the man, that his own life was an embodiment of the principles which he preached, and that his was one of those, of whom the Master said at the close of his long, faithful work of-love, "Well done, good   "NATHAN! NATHAN!"      385 and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord?" The young minister remained at our house a month before he went to board with Mrs. Minor, the widow of our former pastor; for the old lady still occupied the parsonage. We all became much attached to our minister, and greatly regretted his leaving our house; but we used to see him frequently, for he always had some Church business with "Deacon Cummins," which brought him over to our house every few evenings, and he insisted there was no spot which seemed so much like home to him in all Greenfield. Jerusha and he got on very nicely together, notwithstanding his first inauspicious advent at our house; and I know it frequently happened that the minister's calls at our house fell on evenings when my father and mother had gone to a "tea-drinking" at some neighbor's, and that Mr. Willetts-had a habit of walking home with my parents and sister from the weekly prayer meeting. I know, too, that Jerusha's father and mother underwent a great deal of anxiety on account of her high spirits and love of fun, which she could not restrain before the minister, notwithstanding her father's frequent warnings, "Jerusha! Jerusha! my daughter!" I overheard mother lamenting to father this pro- clivity of her daughter's one day, when he was mending his scythe, and he answered:. 33   386    ,  "NATHAN! NATHAN!" "Wall, mother, it's in young blood, jist as it's in young colts, to run wild for a while, and it's no use holdin' the rein too tight. It's my opinion the gal 'ill come out all right in the end, and make jist the same sober-minded, sterlin' woman her nmother did afore her; and she 'll see that her daughter came honest enough by her love of fun, if she'll only look back a risin' of twenty years." "Wall, I'm sure I don't mean to be hard on Jerushy," responded mother, quite softened by this allusion to her own youth. One evening, in the following Autumn, I returned home late from a neighbor's, with whose son I had been down the river fishing that afternoon. It was a still, ripe night, with the large stars hanging their golden embroideries along the sky, and the sleeping face of the earth was wrapped ,up in a snowy vail of moonlight, which made it fairer than the beauty of the day. As I approached the gate, I saw Parson Willetts and my sister come out of the front door, and the voice of the latter floated out to me in the stillness, as she suddenly paused on the steps: "Won't you wait a moment, Stephen? I'll run back and get my shawl, if we are to walk as far as .Berry Bridge, for the dew will be heavy returning." "Certainly it will. I am glad to see you take some thought for yourself for once, Jerusha;" and the girl's break of light, sweet laughter, was flung \     *           0   "NATIIAN! NATIIAN!"     387 back for answer as she went up the stairs. I went surreptitiously into the house by the back way, so that no one saw me, revolving in my mind what I had heard, and scarcely believing the evidence of my owii ears. The next morning I watched my opportunity, and went to my sister while she was churning but- ter in the milk-room. "Jerushy, didn't you call Mr. Willeftts 'Stephen' last night?" She paused. I can see her now, with her hand grasping the churn-handle, and the carnations in her cheeks suddenly bloomed into wide, bright roses, as she asked: "How do you know I did?" "No matter- I heard you! How dared you do such a thing, and he a minister, Jerushy Cum- mins?" A little half-arch, half-defiant smile played among the dimples about her lips. "Jerushy," I said, shocked at what seemed to lme fresh proof of her audacity, "I 've a good will to go straight and tell father, and I shall if you ever do so again! What would he say?" And as I was indignantly going away, after de- livering this threat, my sister's voice summoned me back.                     "See here, Nathan," she said, with a great twinkle of fun in her eyes, although she managed to keep her lips tolerably quiet, " supposin' Mr. Willetts has told me that lhe would never consent   388      "NATHAN! NATHAN!" to my callin' him ally thing but Stephen as long as I live, what then?" This presented a new aspect to the matter. I stood debating it with myself a few moments, and then, like a flash of lightning, the truth suddenly came to me. "Jerushy, you're goin' to be married to Parson Willetts." The roses were peonies now. "Well, what if I am? Have you any objections?" "Did n't I hear you say you'd die an old maid afore you'd marry a minister?" "Well, folks change their minds sometimes," was her laconic, comprehensive reply. I went off whistling, but Jerusha's voice came after me again. "Do you see any thing very bad in my calling the minister 'Stephen' now, Nathan?" "No, I s'pose not, considerin'." A year and a half went by, and my sister, Jerusha Cummins, was Parson Willetts's wife. She passed most of this time at a young ladies' board- ing-school, in a city a hundred miles away, and returned with mind enlarged, and cultivated, with manners softened and dignified, well fitted for the new position she was to occupy. My father's prophecy respecting Jerusha was verified. Her generous impulses "crystallized into solid principles," and Stephen Willetts never re- gretted the day which brought him an unwelcome guest to our threshold; for his fair young wife shed about his home the sanctity of a loving, Christian   "NATHAN! NATHAN!       389 womanhood, and sweetened and enriched every hour of his life with her tenderness and self-sacrifice. The new parsonage, which his people built for Parson Willetts, is still standing, and hoards the memories of fifty-seven years in its silent rooms. A fair company of boys and girls grew up to man- hood and womanhood under its roof, and my nephews and nieces have not forgotten the counsels of their youth in the prime of their years. My father and,mother, Jerusha and her husband, have all gone to walk under the cedars and the palm-trees of the city of our God. I am an old, old man, as I said,:and my chil- dren's children play around me now, and their joy- ' ous laughter seems sometimes to stir in my heart the pulses of its youth; but they never bound as they do on some fifteenth of May, fair with sun- shine and sweet with south winds, as -is this one, just like that one far away in the land of my boy- hood, from which comes stealing up, through its long path of threescore years, the voice of my mother, as it came to me across the pasture lot that day: "Nathan! Nathan!" And in a little while, I who now stand in "patient waiting," hope to hear it again, floating in tones that my heart will recognize across the green pastures and bright waters of the kingdom of heaven: "Nathan! Nathan!" * 4         r
