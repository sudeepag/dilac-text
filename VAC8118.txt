So I was forced to continu~n~iy ~journey, and at last completely

and usually terminates in war; a result frequently courted
wit~r no other view than to school the young warriors, and
ajlbrd the older ones opportunities to acquire distinction. These
wars are sometimes of short duration; at others they only cease with
the extermination, ~or removal 'of one of the parties.
When a nation of Indians becomes too numerous conveniently to
procure subsistence from its own hunting-grounds, it is no uncommon
occurrence for it to send out a colony, or in other words, to separate
into tribes, o~ farr~ilies. Thus with the Sioux there are the Brules,
iuii~ husband's tribe), the Nordos, Washaukee, Wannie, etc. Prc-
paratory to such a measure, runners or spies are sent in various
directions to ascertain the most suitable location. A national
council next hears the several reports, determines on the plan, and
elects chiefs to carry it into operation. The pipe is then sent
round, and all who smoke it are considered volunteers. When the
number is properly proportioned the ceremony of separation takes
place, is at once accomplished, and is truly affeqtiug. The ~ribe s~
separated maintains all its relations, independent of the parent
nation, though the most friendly intercourse is commonly maintained.
and they are almost uniformly allies. Separations sometimes take
place from party dissensions, growing generally out of the jealousies
of the principal chiefs, and not unfrequently out of petty quarrels.
These divisions seldom last long, reconciliation follows~ reflection,

L. In~talking of an. enemy they assume ferocious attitude avid
aspectrseiae hold of1 and brandish their weajons of war; in precisefr
the same manner as ~hpy would do~ if th~y were in his presence, and
alk~ut to engage in a~ deadly.eonfiiet. 'J~'he wampum and pipe' are
handled in conversations on peacef~al subjects,. and everything con-
nected with themes dfameVriealiy reversed.
in speaking of men, tame, birds; trees, marching, hunting, swim-
mhig, etc., etc., the Indian displays a wonderful power for acting
and~ imitating, and the peculiarity of each, individually, is imitated
so ha~py'aArnanne~', aS to be readily understood by those ac-
quainted ~with'the qualities of the subject intended to be described,
although they should be entire strangers to the language.
In their writing and correspondence, the Indians make use alto-
gether of hieroglyphics. it is doubtM if they had knowledge
of methodical combination whether their language would admit of
its use. They~ inscribe their correspondence, and such subjects as
require to beirecorded; on the inner bark of the white birch; or on

powel, and is constantly devising means to torment and punish them.
By the term spirit, the Indians have an idea of a being that can, at
pleasure, be present, and yet invisible; they nevertheless think the

in battle in defence of their country, having the highest claims, will

"What is your name?" I asked.
"Deitosie." (The meaning of which is "from the Great Spirit:')
"That is a very pretty name, and you are a very pretty girl."
"Does my sister think I know not that? Each stream of water
i~ell~ me on~, and the SQund of the other is sufficient."
"Will Dei~osie walk with me toward my chief's hut?"
She consented, and arm in arm we walked toward the centre of
the village, where, pointing out a hut, decorated with blankets and
buffalo robes, many of which were gorgeou~q painted, she informed
me that there I could rest. Accordingly,' after taking a general
survey of the interior, I lay 'me down and s6on fell asleep. When
I awoke Deitosie stood beside me, and my first glance met her eyes.
She smiled sweetly, 'and I arose from my couch.
She inquired if I slept well, and on my i~nawering in the affirma-
tive, she proposed 'a walk, to which I freely consented. Just as we
were about to leave the hut, there entered an old squaw and' a young
one about fourteen years of age, I should judge. With merely a
glance at them, taking it for granted that one was the' mother, and
'the other the sister of Temulle, I followed Deitosie.' We had walked
eome distance, when my companiQn turned and asked me to relate
'her my history. I did so,' and gradually turned ~ur conversation
upon religion. We 'conversed for some time, and I may as well
here state that Deitosie bec~rne a devout convert, as did 'also one
other Indian maiden, of whom I shall have occasion to hereafter
speak. ' '
We had walked~ a long way from tile village, when we came to a
beautiful mountain patlr. tUp this we went until the summit was
reached. Here We 'sat dbwn near the edge of a frightful abyss.
Deito~ie related a legend cbnnected with this particular spot.
Many ~eat~ ago' an Indian maid~rk Who had married a " Brave,"
and by him gi~e~ ~biith to aehild, was in the h~bit of visiting the
sp~ot to ~rneet t6~ return of her husband.' Iii the ~mme tribe there
was atiother brave who had~ beeh, ~efote" her marriage, very 'per-
sistent in his attentions toward her. She did not love Wannotee.

which was the name of her re.jeeted lover, and so gave her heart t
Surnsumot. - One evening she repaired to the meeting place as
usual with her child in her arms. She had been there but a short
time, when Wannotee was seen by her coming up the path. There
was nothing strange in this, so she paid no attentionn to his approach.
In an instant he was by her side, and pouring into her ears such
proposals as no squaw who loves her brave would h8'ten to. With
lashing eyes she sprang to her feet and demanded his instant do.
parture. He merely laughed scornfully, and springing toward her
he seized her in his arms. She struggled bravely, but to no pur.
pose, as she was b~it ~ child in the iron hands of Wannotee. With
a piercing scream, she cried for help. The voice of Sumsumot
was heard in response, and crc long he dashed in sight, on the rock
directly above them. ~umsumot, in a clear ringing voice, corn.
handed his rival to unhand his wife under pain of instant death.
For answer Wanuotee shouted, "Fire but one shot, and your squaw
and papoose I shall hurl below me." (
During this time the Indian wife was making fearKul struggles ~o
release herself, and Wannotee was being backed, without knowing
it, toward the brink of the frightful abyss. The despair of Suni.
sumot who witnessed this scene was terrible. To leave his position
on the rock and reach his wife in time to save her fror~i being
thrown into the abyss was impossible. To fire was a great risk as
he might sho6t his wife or child. He then opened a parley with
his fiendish opponent. Wannotee would agree but to one thing-
Sumsumot must swear by the Great Spirit to give him his squaw,
and take his papoose where he chose. In the agony of despair, at
hearing these words, Sumsumot firedupon Wannotee, the shot took
effect, and for a moment he relinquished his hold upon the woman,
who, terrified beyond description, stood perfectly 5til~, nor made n~
effort. to, escape. Wannotee staggered and seemed about to drop
dead, when with one last, almost superhuman effort, he sprang
towards the Indian woman, seized her in his arms, and with a won.
derful leap learned the edge of the abyss. The shoat of Wanx~otee,

rude xibrxu~inent on the spot; and ever afterwards the rock upon
which Deitosie and I sat, was known as "Cantowinnie" (Abyss of
Desp~iir).
Afterward, in conversation with 'Deitosie, 'I learned, with feelings
of disgust and surprise, that the little Indian 'girl, gnd the old squaw
wlAom I had' seeii'entering Temu ile's hut, were his Wives. The girl

I may here remark, that my husband's ~nglish. was not so pure
as that of Deitosie. The latter, by the way, was of the Cheyenne
tribe. liTer father had been one of a body of Indians wh~ split
from the main body because of a quarrel, and being driven from
one spot to another, himself, daughter, and a young Cheyenne

During my second I eon~e~sed religiously with all the
Indians willing to listen,~o could understand English. My. first
attempt was anything but encouraging, and II finally concluded to
give it up until I could master the Sioux language. This I did, I
may say, easily, and before long I was enabled to offer up prayers
to Him who was, I taught them, the Great spirit of all men, women,'
and children, no matter what their color might be. My attempts to
teach, and reform the Indian children were treated with indifference
and contempt, and I may perhaps be allowed some credt, when I
assert that I continued under the discouraging auspices nearly one

to consciousness, the prisoner's body was burned as far up as his

into his old train of thoughts, and I finally persuaded him to give

Y tribe is that whieb was once known only as the "Dako-
tas" but the greater part of which is now termed the
Sioux. My people have wronged me greatly, and I shall
~ never return to them. My people are mostly what you
term Mvages, and many of them are drunkards, the in-
fluence of your civilization being forced upon them principally in
the shape of~flre.water." To become a chief among the Sioux,
one must, at leabt, have scalped a warrior of another tribe, and prove
to have done so, by producing the scalp; I was not naturally di~
posed to acquire either of these bloody trophies, and consequently
.1 was despised as a coward by my j~ple; although I had never
shown any fear in fighting or exposing my life, whenever we in-
vaded the territory of the Pawnecs, with whom we were constantly
in warfare.
During one of these expeditions, I ventured myself rather near
one of the Pawnee villages, many miles distant from our country,
expecting to find an opportunity for some exploit of bravery or
skill; which might prove that I was not such a coward as my peo-
ple supposed me to be, for none of them had ever gone alone so
near, or rather among the Pawnees, being thus exposed to their
scalping knife, and full vent of their hatred.
Seeing no warrior about the village, that the main body of its
warriors Was absent on an excursion; so I laid myself down in an
ambush among the bushes, where I waited for some adventure.
The great light of the world had already sunk half its way down,
when I saw a beautiful P.iwnee girl approaching me, as innocently

as a lamb might appr~seh a hidden wolf. I did not etirlrnt let her
pass by, while I scarcely breathed for fear I should frighte~i her.
As she passed I withdrew a littl~ from my concealment, a~id turning
she saw rue. At first she was startled. I arose to my feet; but
instead of running away she stood still~ and waited until I had
reached her, when she smiled arid said: "Although you are a Sioux,
you will neither kill nor strike me; fbr your eyes look mild, and
they speak a language which tells me you are good and brave and
would not harm rue.'~
This confiding address disarmed, rue, and throwing away my
weapons to show my friendly int~entious, I said in reply, "Fair
maiden, your words are sweet, and your features vie with the
brilliance of the morning sun. If I were not aSioux, I would be
a Pawnee and hunt for you alone. T&amp;1l rue your name, fair maiden."
She looked down and said: "Although you are a Sioux, I like
to believe in y~rnr k~endliness, and shall. First tell me your name."
"Waanataa I"
Thea you are the grandson of the far-fanied chief? Well, my
name is Diora, the daughter of Petalso, whom they call the bravest
of the braves."
"Then," said I, 'KDiora, the daughter of Petalso, is a fit companion
for WaanaZaa. Will ~he accompany him as his squaw?"
She made answer: "Diora is an oi~phan now. No Pawnee has
yet moved her heart. She has seen W4ianataa and will follow, him?'
When she concluded I caught her in. my arms, invoking the sanc-
tion and iiid of the Great Spirit to our union, and iinswerecl in
delight from my soul: "t~iora has p'y heart,. none other shall have
my lodge, and for thee alone will 1 hunt the forest game."
We then sat dowj and ate togethcr:our first cornzno~neitl, a por-
tion of my provisions taken along with me, looking and smiling at
each other. Some hours past until we thought of leaving, a diffi-

saddlu~s, tied~ t~trees'4 directly in front of us. Without si~opping to
inquire 'fok~ their owners, I hastily seated Diora on one, mounted
myself upoxk another, and with a joyful heart urged them onward.

of national hatred.' But 1 was resolved that he should neither cap-

when the last three 'had had their turn to~ee a 'suffering 'Sioux,

have turned' to indifference, had it not been kept up by every
thought of niy poor 'Diora, and our 'dear .chil&amp; :1 'hoped against
hope, that they were' in a comfortable situatiOn. 'Six full moons

thousand times invoked the aid of the' Great 'Spirit' to my rescue
from this tomb of 'living 'mlseryJ' The sct~nty food~which I.received.
had reduced my strength to that of a child; when one evening the'
old ~hief, of whom I have previously spoken, came into th~'lodge
and said: "Sioux, to-morrow you shall appear before our people."
Without waiting for my answer, he left' me again to my despair, as
I could not guess whether' ~r not my death' was to be the topic of

middle of. the bow, and. between other chief, and gave toe' a seat

I sat upon it. A deep silence prevailed for a fe~r moment, but
soon two men on the left~wing.of the semicircle began t~ beat upon'
a pair of drums, ~to the time of which 'those 'who formed the other

her o~ice lovel features brightened 'th
wi a smile: which in it&amp;very
brought
e9ming~ with it the old, handsome expression, and she
whisered~ "Dear Waanataa~ you have come. at last, ~s come I knew
you woi~4 but we must now part forever, the Great Spirit has
called me~ but he has been very good to me, for he denied me not
yo.lr presence in my last momentss." I tried to close her mouth
with a kiss while thus she spoken and with that kiss a rivulet of
tears, flowed, which ,seemed to bear upon the bosom of its waters
~iiy very heart, it~ agonizing grief, thus floating on toward the bridge
of' wrecked despair.
"I~ar Diora," I managed to utter between my sobs of grief, "you
are v9ry weak and irnist not talk1 let me first give you drink, and
then prepare you nourishing food." I fetched some water in a
leather cup from our little spring, poured it over a handful of meal,
stirred it up with maple sugar, the two mixed with the leaves of
some berries growing near by, and presented it to my poor Diora,
who, with the natural, se1f-denyin~ love of a tender mother, gave her
of
starving baby first to drink, before she thought partaking herself;
while I knelt and wept, unable to further speak.
My efforts were all in vain; I could not save the lives of my
dear ones! The Great Spirit claimed them as his own. At the set.
ting sun the star of my life lost its light, became extinguished; and
in no presence, save, that of the Great Spirit, I stood alone beside
the dead!
When my companions, after continuing their journey in the

open air, I buried the bodies of my gear &amp;hes in the cave, wbi~e1i
thus became a real vault of death. After the burial I remember
no subsequent events until two moons had passedwhen waking from
my long fevered sleep, I found myself once more among the Fox
and Sacs tribes. As soon as I regained sufficient strength I de.
parted, refusing all proffers of friendship; and for many moons I
roamed far and wide, until I at length arrived among the Brule-
Sioux, with whom I have since remained. But sorrow sits deep
upon my soul, life has no allurements for me, for I know not where
o turn.
"Perhaps, dear Wazora" (my Indian name), said Waauataa, as he
included his narrative," perhaps my story has tired you?"
"Oh, no," I, answered, "it has proved very interesting to me, and
deeply syrnpa~hize, with you in your great sorrow."
Waanataa thanked me and withdrewfrom thelodge. Deitosie
md I remained in conversation for some time afterward, when she
~oo left me. Shortly after her departure little Leeoj~oge (Tem'mll~s
goring squaw) entered, and we were soon conversing in quite an
animated and friendly manner; in fact Leeonoge and I had been
good friends from our first acquaintance. What was my surprise
~o learn from her lips that Temxille intejided, that very day, to take
unto himself another squaw. Soon w~ heard the Indian drums beat,
and sounds of "Kee.wan-ah "wer~' yelled, by hundreds of voices.
With difficulty I almost dragged myself to the entrance of the lodge,
~nd there' for the first time witnessed an Indian marriage.
The young Indians are led, both by precept and e~arnple, to
adopt the married life; and instances of celibacy very.ra~ely continue,

practice is encouraged by th~ old men, who however say that when
they were voting they did n~t marry, nor even think of'being called
tuen, unti1~tweuty winters had passed over their heads. The inter.
course with whites, they maintain, has enervated the warriors,
caused the Indians to be more indolent, quarrelsome, and wicked;
and materially shortened the period of their existence.
On the occasion of ~DenUmlle's marriage to his fourth wife, he walked
~najestically 'towai~d ~hc north first, and then successively toward
the Fla~t South, and West. During this time the horrible drums
were fiercely beaten, yells were heard on all sides, and great excite-
~ie1it appeared~ ~o prevail. Then came sileimce, a~~d with it the squaw
to whom he was to be married, and who reali~ wss~ far from being an
ill 'lookii~g woman. She went through'~ the same perfonn~nce, but
after ~walking a certain distance wesf~rard she Lurned, and retrac-
b~g he~ steps about haW ~thc Way, halted, and taking an ear of corn
from beneath the folds of h~r dress; "deposited it upon the ground.
Temulle~then Walked forward, picked up the ear of corn, and amid
furious Jells, threw it far above him. This si~imified an acceptance.
She we~it immediately up to him and seized his right wrist, and
said: "Meemole is' proud, happy, humble, and will do all work for
the great chief Temimile." He then, in a load voiOe, candidly pro-
claimed th&amp; warm attachment he entertalimed for Meemole, widow
of Stameollo the warrior~ 'and at th4 same time presented her with
the heart of an elk (as I afterward learfled), a buffalo ~obe, and, to
my astonishmeiit, a g~Ad chain and locket, which I had worn
befbr~iihna~riage. The reader may readily imagine this whole
scene b~i1~g sonuwhat of' a sensation to 'me, and will I am sure

TH~ INDIANS, AND HOW I DID NOT ESCAPE, 'ETC., ETC.
A
E1~[OIJE, widow of StameoUo, brought an addition into tho
1     family besides herself. This addition was in the shape of
a nine-year-old boy, who then and 'in after years proved
one of my greatest v~rmtmtors. For instance, he would,
instigated by l~is mnqth9r, plane himself in a favorable
position, and, the~i with ~hjs toy' bc"w ~d arrows (a 'very uncivilized
specie of toy II may here remark), he would aim at any portion of
my limbs which might accidentally bec~m~e exposed while I attended
to cooking and Qther domestic arrangements. I did not dare 'te
retaliate, for such a proceeding would not have been tolerated bt
either his mother or step-father.~ Temulle had, since his marriage
with Meemole become a perfect tyrant, and I rcsolv~d to escape if
possible. I gave tip in despair being ever able to accomplish good
in a'missionary point Qf view, and therefore my 'religious views did
not deter me fv~zna ~ed determination toitnmediately attempt the
step.
But, in the midst of thoughts of escape, a serious accident occurred t~
me which bade fair to pi~t an end to my lease of life. Whilst stand~
ing in conversationn, om~e evening, with Deitosie 'and Wasnattia, I
felt ~1co1&amp;subst~nce ne~t the flesh of my leg, and~,jumpinjg from t1i~~
spot, I with a shudder heatd the rattle, and beheld a rattlesnake I
At first I was thankful for my escape from the venomous bite of
the reptile; but suddenly X f~lt'a stinging sensation; and upon exami
nation found that I had actually' been badly bitten~ Waanataa
immediately discovered the true state of affairs, aud' with a Bpring

and cutting it to pieces~
Meanwhile, from fright, I Jay $?nseles~. The squaws in the village
soon gained intelligence of the occurrence, ana were seen running

and was soon by n~y side, and with her a utensil, formed of buffalo
bide, containing water and two or three handfuls of green leaves of
a peculiar virtue. Meantime Waanataa had been busily ehgaged in
placing upon the rattlesnake's bite the innet~ parts of the sliced
pieces of its body. Each slice, upon being applied to the wound
would 'almost immediately turn black; and just as Waanataa was
about removing ~'thixkl piece L awoke. This sli'c~ was' only black

his truths, 'for, said they, "The pale f~ces were se~it upon earth by
the ~vil' 'Spirit, who was at'~ Ios~ fOr some plan to Vex us,~i~d so
conceived' ~the2 idea of sending tis Whites thaV they might r~b us of
04r territory, and leave us nothing in exchange 'but'~i~W~ter, to
madden our brains and destroyy' our bodies."' This was 'th~fr theory,
and. nothing'which the Rev. Madler could advance h~ 'opposition to
it, would in any way combat theit' ideas. "You are good pale face
to~day~ they said, 'F but to~in~rrow's sun may See thee bad 'pale face,
for we have, seen, we cannot but know.
It was the eve of Mr. Madler.'s departure, 'and that of' his cotn-
'panion, 'Maer. We had been sitting outside the door of our lodge.
I bad just related 'the incident of the' snake bite, and mentioned the
leaves which- Deitosie had ue*d 'as a remedy. Maer. 'expressed a
great desire to gather some, in' which' M~. MadI~r also joined.'
Deito~ie,' who was 'present, volunteered'd toi ~how theifr a' spot, but
a short distance from the village, where they 'grew in 'abundance.
T~nulle had been absent some two or'three days, and' not fearing his
-displeasure, I also volunteered to a~pompany the party. The moon'
shone brightly that night, as we set forth' upon' our bota~i~al trip.
We had preceded something over half a mile 'from 'the '4tillage,
when, qui~ as thought; Maer with a funous blow~ struck Mr. Mad-
lerto th&amp; ground, and turning 'dealt Deitosie one equally as hard.
Before I could gather' .mysenses he 'had eonipletely:'enveloped my
head and shoulders in his eloak, thus stifling a11 ~cries for help;
which I might have given vent to. Seizing me in his strong 'arms
he ran quickly forward. I heard the neighing. of a horse near by, and
soon 'feW myself lifted~ upon ~ita back, and knew that Maer wa~ there
beside me. The villain had 'planned the whole affair, and soon the'
horse Was galloping on at a pushed speed. '. My thoughts 'during
this time were of an unenviable kind. 'What object' could he have
in this' abduction ~? Madman, did he not' realize that we should
soon be pursued- and overtaken. ' " ' " ' I
'We had probably gone some~tenior fifteenmiles' before he reined
i~p. fl&amp; dismounted and', lifted me from the'horse~ back. Then a

75

long silence ensued, which was at length broken by shouts front
Maer, and sounds of a switch descending upon the back of the' horse,
a neigh of terror froui the animal, and then as' 'of some' heavy body
rolling down a ravine,
The cloak was then withdrawn from my head, and 'I in a half in-
sensible manner regained my power of speech, and l'5oked around
rue. There stood M'aer with the face of a demon, his eyes bloodshot,
and a ghastly smile on his unprepossessing countenance~
"You' are now the wife of Maer.' Do you not comprehend me?"
he said:
I could make no reply~         - ~.
"You don't mind it, eh? Good 1' 'Well, I wilt tell you some-
thing. In a short time those red-skin devils will be upon us. Ar.
driving at this' 'spot they will~ notice soniethin~ unusual,' and will
trace that something to the edge of this ravine, down which 'I caused
my horse to leap.' They' will 'suppose' ua to have b~eu: on the horse
when he went down. Nov, in order to reach the bottom, they will
be obliged to i'etraOe their steps home eight milea. 'During that
time, and that which we' 'haVe' 'gained in 'advance bf them, we can
walk a little ways-~---ean't' we, my dear?' and after we do' walk a little
ways I knoW a 'nice little hiding place. Now aint I a schemer?
It's all for you, tool"
The villain evidently considered' that I did not object 'to his plans,'
aVid knowing my helplessness, I' concluded for the present not to
un~leceive him. So on we went., until we arrived at the banks of a
sm'~lt stream. Before emerging from the woOds, Maer removed his
nioccasons and de.~ired me to do the same. 'He then procured four
large pieces of wanton bark. ' TWo of thes6 pieces he tied to his
feet;' one under each"foot. The other two pieces he tied to 'mine.
We then' started for the stream; after reaching which we untied
our "bark shoes,"' and walked dOwn th'e brook.
Ho* far We walked I 'have ho ideM; but at last in an exhausted
condition; 'my feet badly'sw6llen; we' re~he&amp; a hut, or lodge, of

And-why need dwell upon tb~hoirible sOene ?-.-these men were tied

Not loDg after this terrible affair, two white girls were brought to

w'asHowso*~. Three yea~s pi~evious the father, John W. Howson,

eound a home in the far West. Everything had prospered, and in
their happy home few thoughts of evibcaine. 1~ut the destroyer
was .on theh tracl~. Ou~ ~day there came se~~en Indians who

exhibited every sign of peaceable intentions. They asked for food
and received it. After stuffing themselves to their hearts' content*
they asked for fire~water. Mr. llowson and his wife, who were
both in the house,~informed them that he had none, in fact never
used it.
"White man lie!'? said one of the Lndians, "and me kill him, he,
no give us fire.water."
Mr. Howson still persisting that there was nothing of that, kind
in the house, the Indiansriished upon; and struck him to the ground,
where they scalped him aflve before the ey~ of' his distracted family.
Mrs. ll~wson, an iri~alid, utiable' to move from her~haiiVsat wring.

took him by the heels and dashed his brains out a~aifist the door-
post. The daughters, Annie and Lizzie, had fainted at this horrible
sight, and when they became consciotis their home was in ash~sand
their m6~her' buried beneath. The Thdians who eomriiitted 'this
dastardly deed were of the L6 tribe, but they brought their captives

on, knowing not what w*~s before us. At any moment We rtiight be
plunged down some~ deep abyss. Oh, it was terrible, but there was
no help for it, so on; on we went.
We had traversed the cavern a great while when we suddenly
beheld, before u~ wh~it ap~e~red to be a star of heaven. Towards it
we went, and after walking'qnite a distance came to a hole scarcely
large eno4h to adniit~ person to crawl through. t first reached

wera on their way, with supplies, to Fort Berthaid, and wished to
stop ~t the Th'ule village. I did not like to own that I was then
attempting to escape from my husband, and therefore, after ttgain
repeating my warning, at which they onlylaughed, I left them to go
their way, They had been gone about half an hour when who should
suddenly appear before us but Temulle. The game was up! It
had been fairly played, but our antagonist held the winning card.
Without a word Temulle pointed toward the Brule village, and I.
in company with my cotnpanioi~, led the way, followed closely by
Ternulle.
Arrived at the village, we were haii~d ~by the. Indians with all
sorta of exclamations, and I was glad to get into the lodger to escape
their~taunts. But my trouble was by no means at~an end. Temuile
walkedin soon after and whipped me so severely that I expected
nothing short of death to ensue. Not content with this be pounded
me with his fists, until, overcome by suph treatment, I' fainted. Nor
was thisall, for in the morning I awoke to learn that the council,
ther~ more than half crazy with liquor, had condemned me to be
burned at the stake.
All my tChristian fortitude was required to bear up under the~~e
trials.
The time appointed for the sacrifice, as the Indians termed it,
arrived, and with trembling limbs, but ~ strong faith in God, I
walked forth to meet my doom. Tied to the ttake I waited the sig-
nal that would stai~t the flames around ~me. The sky was dark
with clouds, heavy winds were blowing,.when suddenly vivid flashes
of lightning illumined the heavens above. Wadnataa now appeared
upon the scene, and addressed the Indians. He bade them beware
~ th~ Great SpiritYs wrath. They were about to burn a woman who
hud nev4 harmed them, and the~ Great Spirit would talk to them.
As he spoke a loud peal of thunder rent the air, and the Indians
dropped as if struck by some unseen power. There I stood a wit.
ness. to this sc0ne of so much import to myself.
The ek'z*xents were ndw let loose hi all their fury1. The wind blew

a p&amp;ecthurrieane, p~al ~ftor peal. crashed as. if in contention with
some~ great ~nt~gouist,..and the Vividness of the. lightning clea4~~
exposed each okjeet to vieW, when suddenly the. earth trembled;
then ,sho0k and abook again, till with one mighty heave it seemed
to throw off all the weight upon it, and the next flash of lightning
showed the laud not far off, to be 8plit as far as the eye could reach.
During these events Waanataa could be seen standing erect, calm
and collected.
Presently the storm abated, and Waanataa walked up to the
stake and severed the cords which bound me, and then, turning to
the Indians, huddled together like sheephe said:
"Sioux, the Great $pirit has spoken, and do you not know what
the lightning was saying ?'"
After the 8tOrJTk had passed over I went to my lodge, arid there
offered up' a prayer of thanksgiving for my rescue from destth.
Temulle, for some time subsequently, treated me with great res-
~ect, as did also the rest af the tribe, but this soon wore off, and
again did I submit to seemingly never-ending persecutions.
The following day a white man approached the village on horse.
back, and informed us that he was one of a party eti route for Fort
Berthald. Ha it was with whom I .l{ad conversed and warned not
to enter the~ Brule village.
After great parley he was ordered to bring his companions before
the chief, and accordingly did so,' when commenced a general massa-
cre, only one of the party' escaping to tell the tale.
Things in the neighborhood were getting too hot for a longer
stay on, the part of the Sioux, and owing to' the late murders and
depredations, they knew that the pale-faces would soon be on the trail
as a~ angers, and consequently after a council had been held, it was
agreed that the best policy would be to "pull up stakes" and
leave.
T'~e ladians generally act upon impulse, and in a short time our
tribe was on the move, and the deserted village lay far behind. For
days w~ travelled, and I, the "noble Indian's wife," was obliged to

Leeonoge(thelatter wa~ theg inadyingc&amp;ndition), and followed my new
"proprietor." Daniel Leroy, the old hunter, did not even some for
ward to bid me farewell, but kept decidedly aloof.
We had been on our way two days, and had probably travelled
some forty odd miles when we struck asmallstreani called the "Naog"
(roaring) brook. MackanIo~6 expressed it as his intex~t~on to remain
here soixte three or four day~. We had scarcely been npou the spot
selected, an honk' when Daniel Leroy rode up, having the three ponies
given Temulh~ by the old ehief, with him. He entered intO ~$ O*~:

to buy me back. ]~e offered the three ponies and other parent~
and promised the old chief" much money" if he would ~e~Iomp5fly
us to one of the forts after the trade.
Nothing h6wever would induce Mackamoza to trade for me, and he
and the other Indian took possession of the three po~iies and badet~
hunter leave them in~tan$ly under pain of death. They aseerted that
Leroy bad stolen she ponies.

Q~S~V4TI~f5 QI~ INDIAN PRACTiCE OF MEDICINE-MANNER OF
TM~T~-'-INPIAN REUBS, ETC., WITH T~AN5LATIONS-RJCCEIPTS
FOR VARIOUS DISEASE~-NEVER KNOWN TO FAIL.
~ HAVE, since 'my return, been importuned by numerous friends
aid acquaintances, to give to the public some of the receipts
~ in use among the Indians, fvr the cure of diseases. The pub-
lishers of this work, knowing the great value of these receipts,
gladly publish, them, and will fully indorWe their efficacy. T
aim confident that the reader will do well' to preserve the receipts,
as, where they have been properly applied, I have never, in one
Instance, known them to fail.
In the spelling of the Indian names I use a system of my own,
which is to spell words according to their sound in pronouncing-
t~iem. My translations may be thoroughly relied upon as being
accurate.
FROSTED MEMBERS.-The Indians make a ,plaster of the re8i,~
of 8ap-pzfle, which has a soothing effect, and removes all irrita-
tion.
CHOLERA MORBUS.-Make a gruel of Waslo-nee (rice) and a tea
~f' Han-to-la (liquorice). Then get a small quantity of Nec-char-jo
(red raspberry leaves), and make a strong tea, which must be given
to patient half a glassful every hour, or oftener, according to severity
of the case.
The red raspberry leaves are excellent in stopping looseness
of the bowels, but care should be taken not to stop the ~looseness
suddenly. -

(what is known as Serpenlaria Virginiana, or Virginia snake root)~
a strong infusion, and drink freely through, the day. The
I rid jans while doctoring rheumatism make a free use of cold water
applied to the parts afflicted, and give the patient a severe rubbing
two or three times a-day.
HOARSENESS, ASTHMA, COMPLAINTS OF THE BREAST, LUNGS,

caustic with great sMecess. It is highly useful in the treatrnen,~W
fistulas, also in indolent ulcers of every kind. It
removes jUia.gous
flesh without exciting any inflammation, and acts but little, except. on
spongy or soft flesh. It is useful in cancers, and in every case WLUt
a caustic is required.

GAftGL~.-Take Sa-inoon (sage), 1 ounce; Rave-o-ee (hyssop),
1 ounce ; pour on one quart of boiling water, and let it stand
half an hour, then strain, and add 1 drachm~ of fine borax. Use.-
This g&amp;rgle is usefully employed by the Sioux~ tribe in aphth~,
and in quinsy or sore throat, particularly 'where there is acute
inflammation.
GARGLE FOR PUTRID SORE TnROAT.~Gee.SUmach (bark of
upland sumach); Lsee.lo.we.nee (high blackberry); Alp-as~ter (com-
mon white elm bark); Alo.o-e~oh (white oak bark); Was-char-ee
(small black snakeroott; Sum-me, ab-ab (nanny berry baW). Take
of each a handful, except the snake.root, which mu~ be only half
the quantity; make a strong decoctiou, add a piece of alum, and
sweeten well with honey, then bottle for use. Apply often to
the sores with a rag. It m~y at first irritate a little, but then cures.
I have seen hundreds cured by this gargle where all other means
were of no avail., In place of alum the Indians use a peculiar kind
of grass, but the alum I know to be an excellent substitute from
experience.
INFU5IO~5..-Infu8ions, or, as they are usually called, teas, are ~
very common and good method used by the Indians, of administer-
ing the virtues of various medical agents. A two-fold benefit is
derived from infusions: 1st, the medicinal properties of the article
made use of; 2dly, the heat and diluent properties of the water.
During the year of my return (1872), which will be long remem-
bered as one of epidemics, and general sickness, my success among
my friends and acquaintances, in the treatment of various diseases,
was so great that I was frequently urged by them to practise
medicine professionally; and by the use of herb teas this success was
accomplished.
An excellent method to make teas or infusions is to put the plant
or root into a tea-pot, pour on boiling water, and let it stand a short
time by the side of the fire. In this way the infusion is readily made
very clear. For infusions generally, put a handful of the herb
into a tea-pot, and add a quart of boiling water; when cool, drink
freely.
For kidney complaint an excellent tea can be made of Tat-ta-loo

powder which 'they manufacture from laurel leaves,' but as I do not
kIw)w th~ formula, and do know the bet~efieitd effect of cream of
tartar, V advise the use of the latter.
Dose.-A wine glassful every hour till it purges.

ment of retention of urine, etc. 'They use an ingredient ~fted by
them "Va-va-so-lee," but as that cannot be obtained, Iloliand gin

I
Co~9N ?oui~TIc~.-.~Take of slippery elm, bark (pulverized) a
sufficient quantity; stir it in hot or warm milk and water, to the
consistence of a poultice. This poultice exceeds every other in
point of ef~acy~ It i~ of almost universal application, and removes
inf~amn~at~on ~oo~pr than any other. Compared to this, every other
poultice dwindles into insignificance.
I will nere add a bit of useful information not of Indian origin,
but o~e~'f great l~euefit to suffering humanity. In scarlet fever,
measles, whooping cough, and small pox (and all kindred diseases),
give freely of brewer's yeast. Its eftbct is wonderful, the disease
is forced out, and all fe~rs of sore throat may be discarded where
the yeast is given. In small pox, a regulation of the bowels, use
of the yeast, and good, careful nursing (the room, in which the
a
patient is placed, to be kept of an even temperature), will do more
thaA all the doctors to be had. The patient's diet in this disease
should consist chiefly of gruels, and warm teas should be frequently
given. Take of saffron and catnip equal parts, make a tea, and
give it warm. Use the fever remedies when fever appears.
Bost nourishment for the disease is barley w~~'r, Indian meat
gruel, buttermilk and water, roas~d apple.% and &amp;'~ ;'uit moderately.
* Let there be a current of air in the roo ~ avoid the same
coming in contact with tjie patient. Great attention must be paid
to cleanliness.' Change linen and clothes often. If eruptions are
large, full of water and irritating, puncture same, and sprinkle same
with dry flour of slippery elm, and the pitting of the face will be
greatly diminished.
In conclusion allow me to assure the reader that all the fore.
going receipts are of great value, and may be fully relied upon.
When you ~o to the druggist be particular to write the exact
qu~intity as given by me, and make use of the Engli8h name, only,
as very 'few druggists have any knowledge of the Indian languages.
he Indians have great faith in the healing qualities of tobacco,
