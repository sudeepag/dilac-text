I am aware that the following story
is one much unlike the popular novels
~f the day-I have failed to follow out
the estaV ed rules of novelists, and
may, by so doing incur the displeasure
if some of those who admire only the
sensation tales of the "flash story pa-
pers," now so popular. But, it has, at
least, one merit, it contains more truth,
than most stories of a similar character
usually possess. The persons figuring
in this humble tale are no ideal crea-
tions. They have all "played their
parts" in threat drama of Life, and
seine of them are, even now, upon the
"stage" of the World. With their per-
mission, have Iwritten out this narrative
~of actual events.
I have given fictitious names to the

different characters, and that is all. lb
no other way have I deviated from the
path of fact, and those who follow me
through the narrative of Juliette Moore's
trials, and triumphs, will be ready to
echo, "Fact, is indeed, stranger than
fiction."
Perhaps some of my renders, those
well versed in fashionable literature cx-
peetmeto apologizeforprdsenting these
pages to the world. I will simply reply
in the language of another-Shelley-
"The spirits that I have raised haunt
m~ until they are sent to the devil of a
printer. All authors are anxious to
breech their bantlings."

The sun was just~ sinking to his wes-
tern home behind the hill tops of the
little New England village of Tarrow-
dale, when the old stage coach rattled
up to the village Inn. It contained
but two passengers, one a lady in deep
mourning, who remained inside-her
destination was, probably, the next vil-
lage. The other, a gentleman, bearing
with him every appearance of wealth
and distinction. After. alighting from
the coach, he sauntered leisurely up to
the bar, and inquired of the pleasant
faced landlord, the way to the cottag~
of the widow Moore. The man eyed
him narrowly for a moment before re-
plying in the following way-
"Wall, I guess you'll find the wider
pr~tty~badly off-she's been aiIm these
many months."
"I did not inquire after the lady's
health, but desire to be directed to her
dwelling," haughtily replied the strang-

While the stranger spoke, the hard-
settled look of haughtiness and gloom"...
which usually rested upon his handsome
features, broke away, and an aznused,
almost cheerful look, took, for a time,
its place.
"Yas, yes," replied Mr. Wiggins, as
he advanced towards the open door,
"do ye see that ar little white cottage,
over on the hill, wal if ye do, that's jist
where the wider Moore has lived these
six years, and a better; a.nicei~ woman.

Julietee stood near the door, her arms
folded across her breast, her lips corn-
pressed, her eyes dilated, he, curia hang-
sag over her face and shoulders in tang-
led masses. Her whole appearance was
o~ie of defiance, and her look seemed to
say, "I defy you." The silence was at
length broken by the appearance of Mr.
Moore, who said-
"What is all this confusion about?
*~ora informed me that there has been
quite a battle fought. Miss Morriss
will you give me an explanation of the
affair?"
"I will, sir; Juliette rang for Corn,
when she should have been engaged with
her studies, and when Corn appeared I
dismissed her, Juliette bade her remain.
I again bade her go, when she turned
tand showered upon me a volley of in-
solence; when I remonstrted with her
in a kind and gentle manner, Juliette
seized from the table a glass, and hurl-
ed it at me; it struck my head
and inflicted, I fear, quite a serious
wound. Not contented with this, she
heaped upon me the most disgraceful
insults, calling me a white slave, and
other degrading names-words which I
would blush to repeat, and dared me to
repremand Corn again, threatening to
kill me, I did so. Really, the temper
of that ehildeis te~'ible, and 1 must in-
sist upon a suitable apology from her,
or I shall leave i~sh4~ Hall."

Mrs. Graham had sent her letter to
George Moore, and as each day passed
she looked anxiously for an answer.-
One came at last. Henry brought it to
her one afternoon, when he returned
fromia college , and after reading it, the
widow communicated to her son and
daughter the eor~ial invitation the lat-

"Indeed I cannot be grateful enough

widow.

me to do so. She has insulted me, ~he,
apoor miserable dependent dared strike
me, I'll not bear injustice from her, nor
frQm you. Is this the way you fulfil!
the solemn duty, my mother entrusted
you to perform; remember, she can see
from the Spirit land the injustice done
her child."
"Juliette I wish no outbursts of pas-
sion; you must be tamed; your temper
must be subdued, and I htwe chosen
Miss Monies to accomplish the task..-.
You shall apologize to her," he said in
a sharp imperative tone.
"Never! never!! and Miss Morriss
shall not subdue me; she is a vile, de-
signing woman. I can never learn to
be good under her tuition; I will not
live under the roof that shelters hex. I
would rather share the cottage of the
witch in the haunted grove, though it
be ~he terror of the whole neighbor
hood,"
"You know net of what you speak.-.-
You have never seen the witch of the
grove, and if she should terrify you as
she has all those who have seen her, I
pray that you may ever be spared from
meeting her. It sounds well, for a child
like you, to threaten to leave the only
home you have, because your temper
*nd your pride rebel against making
an apology to one you have most gross-
ly insulted."
"I have informed you, uncle George4
of my determination. I am not a child
at heart, though .1 may be so in years,"
and Juliette passed from the apartment
* with a haughty tread. Sheseemcdn'ore
like a woman of twenty than a girl of
fourteen. After leavingthe library she
sought her own room. When she en-
terad the aparta~snt she found Cora sit-

ting by the work stand, engaged insew-
ing Scene light material.
~'Cora," she said, sa4iy, "lay aside
your wock, I need your assistance for
to-night, I leave Ashly Hall, perhaps5
forever."
"Leave dis place! leave your Uncle!
why war on artb you go to? you got
no odder home but die," replied Cora
in amazement.
"1 am going to fly to the little cabin
by the brook, there I will remain, for a
time at least."
"Gem to de cabin by de' brook? why
missy de witch ob de grove, who lives
near dar, will be sure to catch you and
kill you."
"No, no, Cora, t do not fear her, I
have never harmed her, and Bhe will not
molest me. While I remain concealed
there you must bring me food, but if
you love me, you will tell no one, ~vhere
I have hidden myself."
"What, not even mnssa X'7alter I" in.
quired Cora.
"No, no one must know where I am.
I will return to the Hall if Miss Mor-
ris's leaves; if she continues to remain,
God only knows what will become of
me, He will take care of me, and no
harm will befall n.e while I trust Him."
"Do blessed Savior will take care oh

months. Her health was fully e'eab-

her to return home, w~is received. She
had not passed those months nsnil scenes
of elegance and ceec, and in a clime cel-
ebrated for its mildness and agreeable-
ucs', without learning to love them and
feeling a pang of sorrow when she con-
templated leaving them. She had not
passed hours of pleasant intercourse
with Mr. Moore in his library, without

wild creature.
The day at length arrived, which was
set for the departure of Effie Graham..
Mi'. Moore was to accompany her home,.

tor for the girls. Amid tears and sobs
Efile took her leave and the traveling.

with it one loved by every living thing'
upon the plantation.
After her departure the house seemed'
lonely and alimmat deserted Walter was
home but little of the time, his 'studies
occupied his time and attention. lanthe
was absorbed in the pages of exciting
end thriving novels, and Juliette was
left almost to herself for amusement,
and consequently an intimney sprung
up between her and Clara Simons, to..
gather they 4ould roam the woodsanet

"Time rolls on with rapid flight,
Nor stops in his career;
He sweeps our loved ones from our sight,
Nor spares Our hopes most dear."
"Day follows day, year rolls on year;
They just begin, then disappear.
how quick, how rappid is their flight.
'Tis hardly day, wien lo? 'tis night!
How swiftly do the seasons flow,
