(3)   PREFACE. WHLST with the ministry of the sacred word in this land of  the Pilgrim Fathers are associated all the benefits which make life happy, it is passing strange that the people often suffer themselves to be deprived of any of the influences which this blessed institution of Heaven is designed to impart. Prominent among the ways in which these influences are im- paired is the frequency of change in the pastoral office. The causes tha lead to such change are often the best evidence for demonstrating that the people have not profited as they might and ought to have done under those utterances of the word with which they have become weary, and which they desire to have  cease that nore welcome ministrations may be enjoyed Whilst these causes, which are many, are being nourished, as they fre- quently are in some parishes for months and years, and in the efforts which are put forth, after a pastorate has become vacated, to obtain an incumbent suited to the sphere, it is evident the word preached doth not profit; for the seed which is scattered by the   6            PREFACE. Slower doth not fall on susceptible soil, where it can bring forth fruit, v' some thirty, some sixty, and some an hundred fold." It is the design of the present work to aid in counteracting this evil in our parishes, which has become truly'great and for- midable. By it, already, has spiritual famine been occasioned in many a garden of the Lord; and many a good husbandman, placed there by the glorious Proprietor, has-been driven from his place, or has yielded to discouragement and despair, and sought relief in some less exposed position. Except the remedy for this evil, which is readily suggested by an enlightened and tender conscience, be vigorously applied, it is not pleasant to re- flect upon the consequences of its enlargement which may sur- round our children and our children's children. Then it may have dreadfully marred and disfigured the church of God, and have made every form of infidelity Victorious, and this- land - which for the love of truth was sought after and obtained, and which became a goodly land, where the gospel for centuries had free course and was glorified--have become a desolate land, fosaken of God, and a place of idols and of every abomination. - i"; Many months ago the plan and general features of this work were conceived and drawn out, and before any other work, with the slightest resemblance to it, was known. The author, there- fore, feels that he is not an imitator of others. The same judg- ment, too, it is thought, will be 'formed by the reader, as it will be perceived that the general train of thought prevalent in the succeeding pages is upon subjects which are not imbodied in any other work.   a1          PREFACE.             7 Because a conversational, and not a didactic style has enm employed it need not be supposed that the present work is a fic-' titious narrative, without the authority of facts and truth. Had it not been for facts the"'necessity of the work would not have been suggested nor would it have been undertaken. It is pre- I sumed that every reader who has had. acquaintance with the  i course of events, relating to pastors and churches for the last quarter of a century can readily call to mind cases correspond- ing to those which are brought to view in the present volume;  and other readers, who may not have been particularly conver- sant or concerned with the history of American and New Eng- land churches within this period, will find it to be no difficult  task, when the mind is addressed to the investigation, to gather a multitude of facts of as exciting a character as any which are disclosed in this work. The author feels that nothing but the truth is here presented, and that it is important that every lover of Zion feel such truth, and be incited by it to those efforts which a knowledge of this truth must suggest as being absolutely demanded, both that the fulness and richness of the ministry of the word may be enjoyed and the prosperity and stability-bf the churches may be advanced. Should the pastors of our churches and those their friends of Zion who have long mourned over the evils which are in this volume portrayed take an especial interest in its circulation and commend the work to public attention in their respective localities, it is thought they would soon have evidence that they had been doing an important work for their own particular Zion and for   i -    *8     M     . PREFACE. the completeness and permanency of their own particular min- istry. If in any degree the present volume shall contribute to the accomplishment of these objects, the design of its mission will be fulfilled; and that it may, is the author's most fervent prayer. v    CONTENTS.

ORDINATION,  FROM one of the beautiful towns of New England two sons and brothers went forth together, soon after attain- ing their majority, to enter on the active duties of life in the State of Virginia. These sons, by their mother, de- scended from one of those distinguished clergymen of which their native state has furnished so many, who during a long life was the minister of the town and parish. Their mother was the daughter of a highly respectabley and af- fluent merchant of the place, and was greatly distinguished by'the beauty of her person, the refinement of her man- ners, the intelligence?f her mind, and the fervor of her piety. Their father was of Connecticut origin, out left the place of his nativity when a young man, and entered on mercantile pursuits in the town where they were born. He, too, was a gentleman of considerable education, was possessed of what is popularly called strong common sense, and was long confided in by the community as a man whose example it were safe to follow and whose opinions it were unwise to disregard. Such being the character of the parents, it is easy to infer the influences which would control theducation of the children. It is therefore sufficient to remark that they were nurtured in 2             (13)  "-     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. the fear of God, and with continued supplication at his gracious throne thatthey might each be beacon lights in the community to guide and persuade all around into ways of virtue, philanthropy, and general usefulness. Although it was the happiness of Squire and Mrs. Davidson to see some of their children exhibit the blessed fruits of the in- fluences which they, so sedulously employed in their ed- ucation, they were not all developed in the sons Charles and Edmund, of whom the reader is now being informed, in the period of their history to which this chapter relates. Having been conversant with fashionable life,--for no circle was higher than that in which their family moved, -and having always known the blessings of affluence, their buoyant spirits had not yet been mellowed by the genial influences of piety. -Whilst their parents prized them for their general dutifulness and saw no tendency to disreputable life, they had many seasons of grief because their God was not the God of these their sons. Nor were they strongly averse to all the influences of religion, nor extremely restive when these influences were tightly in- twined, around them; but the mother, when every feature X of her face was serious and earnest, as she strove with them to pursue things eternal rather than what were earthly, often found it extremely difficult to prevent her pleasant eye from being in sympathy with her lips as something more than a smile was seen there at play, whilst some unlooked-for pleasantry escaped from them. From the character the mother had given them of their grandfather, before alluded to, as well as from the friend- ly relations subsisting between their parents and many of the clergy, and from the position their father occupied in the parish as one of the principal men, if not the leading character, therein, all their children were sensitive to every thing pertaining to the prosperityof the church, At the period when the ordination we are now de-   ORDINATION.         15 scribing was to occur in their native town, Charles and Edmund had been residents of Virginia about twelve years, and had made but one visit to the home of -,heir childhood and youth. Each had married and become a parent, and both had prospered in business; and Charles, by his marriage, had become exceedingly affluent. One day in the month of April, as he was sitting at dinner in his splendid mansion, he remarked to his wife,- "My dear, I have had a letter from mother to-day; and, among other things, she informs me they are to have an ordination there on the 10th of June." "Ordination!" said a little boy of some eight years, as he turned his sparkling blue eyes in surprise on his father. "What is that?" " "Well, Arthur," replied the father, " if your grandmoth- er Davidson were here I rather think she would be sur- prised at your question, and would think that I had not endeavored to make you familiar with scenes in New England  which' are ever regarded with the gOeaiesto interest." "I think not, husband," remarked the wife. "I think 'her candor would incline her to make allowance for differ- i ence in circumstances. She would not be surprised at Arthur's question; for you know our worship is different I from hers, and ordination among Episcopalians is not a very common service only in the parish where the bishop resides. I do not think Arthur's question a very surpris- ing one."                       A "Papa," said little Arthur, impatient at the digress'on which had retarded the answer to his question, "what is ordination?" "Well, now, my son," the father said, as he put his arms around the neck of Arthur, "I will tell you. Ordination is making a minister." "Minister! What is that?"   16     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. At this iquestion both Mr. and Mrs. Davidson were nearly convulsed with laughter, which almost bewildered poor Arthur, who was far from thinking of provoking even a smile. As soon as the father had recovered him- self sufficiently to speak, he remarked, - "My dear, if mother were here now I rather think she would conclude there was no Puritanism in this quarter. and that I had abjured the faith." "I really thought," said Mrs. Davidson, " that Arthur knew what a minister is; for you know how many times we read of the minister in the prayer book." "I rather guess," said Mr. Davidson, " the boy don't read the prayer book much." "Well, he hears from it almost every Sunday at church," Mrs. Davidson replied. "But you know, my dear, there is not any thing said at church about the minister. What is in the prayer book is only direction to the minister to say or do thus and so. Arthur knows what a minister is; only he knows him under another name.  He seldom, if ever, hears Mr. Crocker spoken of only as our rector, you know." "Is Mr.. Crocker a minister, papa?" "Yes, my son; Mr. Crocker is a minister. We call him rector because we are all of us in this region Episco- palians. Where I was born there are a few Episcopa- lians. The great majority of the people-are Methodists, Congregationalists, or Baptists; and they call their preach- ers, when settled, pastors, or ministers." "I think you said, papa, ordination meant making a minister. I should not think that that was any great affair." "It is, Arthur, in New England," said the father. "When they ordain a minister where grandpa Davidson lives it is a great day. Much more do they make of it than we do of our Christmas."    ORDINATION.         17 "Is it any like Christmas, papa? O, I like Christmas ; for then we see our friends and have all the go6d things to eat. O, I like Christmas; I wish it was all the time:" "I have been thinking, my dear, since I received moth- er's letter, that perhaps we had better conclude to make o our visit at the north this season instead of the next. should really like to be at home when they have their ori dination. If you approve, I think we will go on, and take Louisa and Arthur with us.", '; Yes, papa, that is good ; do go. I want to go." "I rather think," said the father, " if you go, I shall be under the necessity of giving you a little instruction to prepare you to meet grandpa and grandma Davidson. I must get some Puritanism in you to have you of good savor with them." It was finally concluded by both Mr. and Mrs. David- son that they would visit New England and be present at the ordination in the town where he had passed his early life. Accordingly, about the middle of May they set out on their long journey, and arrived at the paternal mansion on the Monday preceding the ordination. As no intima- tion had been given of the intended visit, it may easily be imagined what was the surprise depicted on every coun- tenance as, young Davidson unceremoniously opened the sitting-room door, that opened from the hall into which he and his wife and children had silently entered. "Charles- Charles Davidson I " exclaimed his mother, as she let fall the cup of tea which was half raised to her lips, " is that you?" instantly rising from the table where the family were at tea. "Why, Charles!" burst forth from the squire, letting his knife suddenly fall on his plate, " how you surprise, us!" and, following the example of his wife, left his seat to grasp the hands of his children. "And you, Ann," turning from Charles to his wife, said   18     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. the mother, -"how do you do? and, Louisa and Arthur, how are you?" as she rapidly seized their hands and im- printed on their faces a succession of kisses and various- ly expressed her surprise and joy. As soon as Squire and Mrs. Davidson had given vent to, their feelings and had relaxed their grasp of the hands of their visitors, the other members of the family had oppor- tunity of testifying their love and joy to the brother and sister and nephew and niece. Among these was- an aunt of Charles, the sister of his father, ever -regarded by all the children of the squire with the greatest affection and respect. Being now greatly enfeebled, by age and dis- ease, she slowly approached the group, manifesting her great interest in the new comers by many expressions of tenderness and love. "Well, Charles," concluded aunt Sarah, after having given her first salutations, " you will be here now at our ordination, Wednesday." "Yes, aunt," said Charles; " that is what excited the idea of this visit, I confess. I did not think of coming on this season until I received mother's letter in April last, in which she informed me you were to have an ordination here." "Why," exclaimed the squire, " did you not inform us you were coming in the letter I received from you two weeks since, when you were at Baltimore? I did not dream you were then on your way here. I thought you were there on business, and had your family with you vis- iting their relatives." "I thought, father, I would not excite expectation ; and, moreover, I pictured to myself the very scene which has been enacted here this evening, and I thought I should en- joy very much the surprise which has been manifested since our- arrival.'               ' "Well," said aunt Sarah, "Charles is Chsrles yet.   ORDINATION.         19 When he was a boy there was no calculating on his capers." "There was no great criminality attending my boyish , capers, was there, aunt Sarah?"  "O, no,?' aunt Sarah replied. "They were so different / from other boys' that I was never exactly prepared for them."' The evening wore away while the wholefamily group were busy in conversation, on various subjects connected with home scenes, and it was rather a late hour before re- sort was had to slumber. The next morning at the breakfast table, the conversa1 tion turning upon the important event that was to trans pire on the ensuing day, Charles asked of his father who and what kind of a man was to be ordained.    / "He is from the State of Vermont," the squire replied; "and his name is Mr. Eldridge. He was educated At Yale College, and pursued his theological studies at An- P dover. I believe he is twenty-nine years of age, and comes recommended by the professors as a young gentleman /of high talents, extensive acquirements, and ardent piety. ' He has been preaching here about four months; and I must say I never heard many better sermons from a young man, or sermons better delivered from any man." / "That is saying considerable, father," Charles observed.; "for few individuals have seen more of ministers than yourself, or have heard more preach." "Well, Isacknowledge," returned the squire," I am very much carried away with Mr. Eldridge, and am very happy that he is to be our minister." "How is he out of the pulpit?" asked Charles. "O, he is very sociable and dignified, and interests the' i entire family he visits." ' "Is he married?" asked Ann of Mrs. Davidson. "No, not yet," was the answer.    20     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "He is engaged, then, is he not?  "Yes," said the-squire; "he is engaged; and I am glad of it." "Why are you glad?"Ann inquired. "Because, if he were not engaged, all the young ladies in the parish would be thinking of their own prospects for the prize, and there might be a door opened for trouble," replied the squire, as he turned a significant look at his youngest daughter, a young lady of nineteen years, who sat at the table. Breakfast being over, and family worship having been observed, Mrs. Pavidson excused herself from the circle by remarking, her domestic cares at this particular time demanded her attention in another part of the house. As she left the room Arthur followed her, and soon found himself in the kitchen. Here he saw many things which reminded him of home and of that particular season of the year before alluded to as bringing him many sources of happiness. As he saw what was going on in the prep- aration of pies, cake, &c., he burst out, saying, - 'I Grandma, this makes me think of our Christmas ; but it is not exactly like it here," looking about and eying two female domestics busily at work. "Why is it not exactly like it, my dear?" asked the grandmother. Looking up, as if he wished to reply in a whisper, which brought down the ear of Mrs. Davidson to Arthur's head, he said,-                , "We don't have white people to do our work, grandma; we have black servants." Mrs. Davidson pleasantly remarked, - "Yes, Arthur, I know you have black servants at the south; but I don't care about having such here." "Why not, grandma'?" inquired Arthur. Mrs. Davidson went on and told her grandsonl many   ORDINATION.         21 reasons for not wishing the labor of slaves; Which only drew from Arthur the general reply, that his ather's ser- vants were not treated in the manner described, but art- i lessly said he knew of some masters and mistresses on the plantations in the district where he lived who did treat their slaves pretty much as grandma had said. Arthur, having sufficiently satisfied his curiosity in the kitchen, went out of the back door into the yard in quest of other objects of amusement on the premises. As the family were sitting in the parlor after dinner, engaged in social chat on various matters, tie hall door was opened, and Mr. Eldridge, the pastor elect, was an- nounced. After being received by the squire and his lady with great cordiality and introduced to their chil- dren from the south, they all sat together interchanging remarks on different subjects for a considerable time. It was evident to the spectator that both Charles and his wife were very warmly interested in the appearance and conversation of Mr. Eldridge, which they unmistakably evinced in the earnestness with which they seconded the invitation of the squire, that he would prolong his visit, when he arose to leave, and favor them with further pleas- ure from his society by stopping to tea. But the morrow being ordination day, all saw the propriety of his reasons for being in undisturbed meditation during the evening; and he withdrew. The door had scarcely closed after him as he passed into the hall before Charles exclaimed,- "What a wonderful young man that Mr. Eldridge is! How easy and graceful his manners! how at Lome he is on almost every subject! and withal how he makes prominent, and without any ostentation too, the ministerlI I declare, I wish we had him at the south."  "Well," the squire remarked, "he makes the same im- pression almost every where."  "What an eye he has! what a pleasant voie I I dare say he is an orator," continued Charles.   22     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONACGE. So much enraptured was Charles with Mr. Eldridge that it was difficult for him, during the entire evening, to' avoid introducing his name and manifesting his pleasing- impressions in regard to him. He was almost impatient for the ensuing morning, that he might have an opportu- nity of seeing him in circumstances which would, -if any circumstances could, draw out the whole man. The morrow came, and it was one of June's most lovely days. Nature around seemed to smile auspiciously on the sctnes in prospect; and gratefully were the hearts in the household of Squire Davidson impressed towards the gra- cious Author of the seasons for furnishing such a day for such a purpose. All were in readiness for breakfast at an earlier hour than usual, to be prepared for the council which was to assemble in the noble mansion at half past eight o'clock. As many individuals in the parish had friends abroad who were strong in their attachments to their respective pastors, and, by reason of this strong attachment, had been brought thither for relaxation and health, and had made deep impressions on the people in the parish, it was there- fore natural that such should be invited. on the council; and for this reason was this body unusually large, as com- mon usage required the extension of an invitation to the adjacent churches. The council, at the appointed hour, was organized, and the great business of its assembly at A the mansion at once commenced; viz., the examination of the candidate. The moderator proposed-leading questions on the fundamental doctrines of Scripture, which were promptly and most intelligently answered. There was such fulness-of reply and such nicety of discrimination, that, when the examination became general and each mem- ber of the council had the privilege to interrogate, all were eager to propose questions, not so much for satisfy- ing themselves of the fitness of the candidate for the great   ORINATiOr.          23 work before him as to-refresh their own minds with many a train of pleasing reflection on different truths of revela- tion, which his rbplies gave them the fullest dpportutity for doing. When the examination toudhed ion the re- ligious character of the young man, his persoinal experi- ence of the power of those great truths he designed tO preach, his views in entering on the onerous work -of the ministry, it came out to the satisfaction of evefy mind that he had felt the plague of sin in his own bosom, and that, for the love he bore the great Deliverer of th'e sinner, he wished most ardently to be instrumental in glorifyihng him, in beseeching his fellow-men, in his stead; to be reconciled to God. It appeared that no earthly rewards had influenced him in the choice of his profession, and that his only motive seemed to be, to aid in the salvation of his fellow-sinners. He seemed to be happy in his pros- pects of usefulness in the field where he had been called to labor, and, by more than one remark, left the impression on those who heard him that he expected to live and die among the people of his first love. The examination closedd with the warm and unanimious decision of the council to go forward and set him apart as the minister of the church and pastor of the people. Whilst the council w/s engaged in the preliminary work of the day, little Arthur was busy at one of the windows watching the carriages which passed his grandfather's house in thick succession towards the church where the public services were to take place. So great was theit number that he declared he neaer saw so many horses be- fore in all his life; and he wondered where the people came from who were being conveyed by them. When the council had adjourned to thO church, to en- gage in ordination services, Arthur was wide awake in his movements over the house, and was particularly at- tentive to the kitchen; for here he saw very much more   24     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. of "merry Christmas" than on the preceding day. As the council was to dine at his grandfather's, the note of preparation was neither'low nor slow; and it was a matter of no small wonderment to him what was to become of all the puddings he saw, as well as of the chickens, turkeys, &c. He thought ordination day was far before his Christ- mas ; and frequently wished he could live here in New Eng- land, that he might enjoy many such days. A little after two o'clock the noise of carriages began again to be heard; for the great event had passed, and the people were dispersing for dinner. Little Arthur was there at the windows and doors, highly excited at the velocity with which carriage after carriage was drawn along the road. Whilst he was thus engaged he turned to aunt Sarah, who was sitting by, and inquired if all the people who passed along lived in town. "O, no," she replied; " not a quarter of them." "Will they all go home to dinner?" "I presume not," aunt Sarah said. "Where will they get their dinner, then, aunt Sarah?" "O, they will get it at their friends', who live in the parish. Every house will have more or less of them; for all the people are expecting company to-day." - "Well, -they'll have a good time of it, won't they, aunt Sarah?  At this juncture those who were to dine at Squire Da- vidson's began to enter the house; and soon three large rooms, with extended tables spread therein, had a numer- ous company of guests busily at work on what little Ar- thur had seen in the kitchen in the morning. Whilst thus attending to their bodily wants there was no lack of intel- lectual activity; for remark was frequently heard from different parts of the tables upon the various performances at the church which the people had so lately left. The company seemed to be of one mind as to the high order   ORDINATION.         25 of talent which these varied services brought forth, as well as to their peculiar appropriateness and solemnity. So much impressed were they with their rich excellence, that, for upwards of an hour after the tables had well minis- tered to their necessities of body, they continued their conversation upon what they had heard and upon subjects in illustration of the different truths which had been pre- tsented. Then, sitting and standing a while in conversation on other topics, the company began one after another to leave-; and, before the sun went down, all but three clergy- men had left, and the family of the squire was restored almost to its usual quietude. In the evening, the scenes of the day furnished the themes of conversation in the family of the squire. ,Wmhilst all were highly interested in the different parts of thel public services of the ordination, -the prayers, the ser- mon, charge, right hand of fellowship, - it was evident that what made the deepest impression was the manner in which their new pastor acquitted himself at his examination in the morning. From this it was argued that his usefulness would not be small nodr his reputation narrowly bounded, and that all the parish might well rejoice that such an ascension gift had thus been conferred as existed in the Rev. Mr. Eldridge. On the Sabbath following the ordination, the pastor was very happy in the choice of subjects most appropriate to the new relations which had been recently consummated. It was most affecting to hear hinj speak of the responsi- bility which attached to his duty f preaching and to the duty of his people of hearing the word. It was evident that he had large expectations of usefulness in his present charge, and that it was his long and settled determination to employ his various researches and attainments for the temporal and eternal good of those who might be commit- O) C   26     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGEo ted to his spiritual care. It was evident, too, that the new pastor contemplated his present field of labor as his only charge, and that he relied for permanency and suc- cess on the power of God, as such aid might be vouch- safed in answer to his own and his people's earnest and persevering supplication at the throne of grace. The pastor was trustful to the promises of his ,Savior and to the pledges of the people who had called him to labor in the midst of them; and, by reason of such trust, he re- marked, in his morning discourse, he should lay broad his plans for extensive and permanent usefulness among them. "I have not sought wealth as my portion, nor honor, nor ease; but the glory of Christ in the salvation of souls. For nearly ten years have I been preparing for the great and responsible work on which I have now entered, and nearly two thousand dollars have I expended whilst mak- ing this preparation. And now have I been sent hither to make proof of my ministry to you; and, here by the grace of God will I labor, relying on the good faith of the peo- ple-who have called me and on those promises of Jehovah to his faithful servants which are neither few nor small." As might be expected, his discourse, containing many such paragraphs as the above, when speaking of the scrip- tural duties of the pastor and people, made a deep impres- sion on many a heart; and it is fair to presume that from more than one bosom went forth the prayer that the large expectations of the pastor might be more than realized.   o7   CHAPTER II MARRIAGE AND COMMENCEMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING. ABOUT six weeks from his ordination Mr. Eldridge made a visit at the house of Squire Davidson, After mingling a while with the members of the family, who were sitting together in the parlor, he signified to the squire a desire to confer with him in private. Upon the compliance with this request, after the two had withdrawn from the circle, a wonderment on the part of the ladies was at once ex- pressed of the object of the interview. Various causes were conjectured. Mrs. Davidson thought there might be a difficulty somewhere in the parish at which Mr. Eldridge was disturbed; for she well remembered the frequency with which their late pastor had called and sought the ad- vice of her husband in private in relation to the troubles which were thick- about him. Aunt Sarah was not so fearful. She did not believe any such reason had prompt- ed the young pastor to seek an interview with her brother., It was her opinion that he wished to disclose some plans whereby his general usefulness in the parish might be greatly augmented. She remarked,-   - "I always thought, if Mr. Eldridge should settle with us, that he would devise some new ways for benefiting his people, and yet would be cautious how he proceeded. I rather guess he wanted to consult with brother in relation to some of his plans." (27) ,   28     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. Here Ann laughed aloud, and remarked, in apology for her merriment, - "I always have heard that the Yankees were noted for guessing. Since I have been in New England I have heard the expression similar to the one aunt Sarah has now used so often that it is difficult for me to restrain a smile whenever it is repeated." "Don't people guess any at the south?" aunt Sarah inquired. "I presume they do," was the reply; " but they do not use the word guess as you use -it here. I do not know that I ever heard a southerner say, ' I guess so and so.' " "No, aunty," Charles observed ; "we southerners don't guess any." "That's pretty well for you, husband," remarked Ann. "I wonder what Mr. Carlton would say if he were here." "What would he say?"Charles asked. "You know, my dear, how much he enjoys himself over your Yankee expressions, and especially when he hears you say, 'I guess.'" "Then they use the term reproachfully at the south?-" aunt Sarah remarked. "Not exactly so, aunt," Ann replied; "but we always know a Yankee before we have been in his society five, minutes, because the expression,' I guess,' is sure to be made within that period." "Well," said Charles, "I would really like to know whlat the minister wants of father. I wish he would come in and favor us with his society." Though many speculations were afloat in the circle in relation to the interview of the pastor with the squire, yet all failed to satisfy. There was therefore a general im- patience for its termination, that relief to their anxiety might be afforded by the lips of the squire himself. This time did not quickly come; nor till long after the usual   MARRIAGE AND HOUSEKEEPING.      29 hour for tea was suspense removed by the presence of the squire in the room from which he had been absent fol up- wards of three hours. "What has- closeted you all this afternoon with Mr. Eldridge?" was the quick inquiry of Mrs. Davidson of her husband. "Important business," was the reply gravely returned. So sober was the utterance and manner of the squire that Mrs. Davidson was certain of being the correct in- terpreter of the reason of the interview, and she almost tearfully asked what were the difficulties which were per- plexing and trying the young pastor. "His trouble is pretty great and serious, and -- " "O, what is it? What is -it? What is his trouble?" asked four or five voices at once, thus preventing the squire from completing the sentence. "t Mr. Eldridge wishes to: be married and to go to house- keeping, but he cannot find a house," the squire remarked. On this reply, sighs, which before were heavy and nu- merous, suddenly were exchanged for peals of laughter which almost shook the room. "You are too cruel, Mr. Davidson," said hip wife, when she was recovered from her laughing sufficiently to speak ; "you are too cruel," she said, still smiling in tears. "How could you act so when you saw how we all felt?" "You asked me, my dear, for the trouble which was perplexing Mr. Eldridge; and before I had time to give an intelligent reply, which I was proceeding to do, you all became so excited and were so loud in your inquiries that I was somewhat embarrassed. Did I not explain as soon as I had opportunity?" "But then you looked so sober, father," said Ann, " that we could not feel otherwise than excited." "Well," said the quire, " is not Mr. Eldridge in trouble? I think he is. I am sorry that you have so poor an opin- 3H   30     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGE. ion of our people as to think that there were any parish troubles for him thus early in his connection with us." "You know, husband," Mrs. Davidson remarked, "how often our late pastor used to come to see you about the difficulties with him; and it was natural for me to fear that some such reason might have prompted the desire of Mr. Eldridge to see you in private; and I said to the children that I was apprehensive Mr. Eldridge had heard something said to his disadvantage, and was somewhat dis- turbed, and wished for your counsel." "Well," said the squire, "my dear, you see the trouble is not very formidable." "O, yes," Mrs. Davidson replied; " yes, yes. I think such a trouble can easily be removed. 'He can have our Allen house." "How so?" the squire asked. "Mr. Tucker has a lease of it for two years, you know; and it is -not six months since he moved into it. Well, that is the only house near the church which will accommodate Mr. El- dridge ; and that is the house he wants. \He told me Dea- con Smith suggested that I might arrange it with Mr. Tucker so that he would vacate it and move to the new house of ours on the Gray lot. I finally told Mr. Eldridge I would see-what could be done for him." "How soon does he wish for a house?"Ann inquired. "Within two months," the squire replied. "I suppose, father, you now know who the lady js to whom Mr. Eldridge is to be married," Frances said, the squire's youngest daughter, alluded to in the previous chapter. "Yes, my daughter ; it is no longer a secret. He told me her name and all about her, and gave me permission to use my knowledge at my discretion. She is the daughter of a farmer in the State of New York by the name of Whiting. She is twenty-two years old, and, Mr. Eldridg e   MARIIIAGkF AND HOUSEKEEPING.    3i says, is well educated, of good sense, intelligent, and a very devoted and active Christian." "I presume she is a suitable companion for him," Mrs. Davidson remarked, " or he would not have selected her." "I hope she will be a suitable wife for the minister of our parish," aunt Sarah said. "Our people are rather particular, you know, about the wife of their minister." "We shall soon see her, I hope," the squire observed. "I shall go in the morning and see Mr. Tucker, to ascer- tain if he will move." "I presume he will," Frances remarked. "He is a very accommodating and reasonable man, and thinks every thing of his pastor." The next morning the squire called upon Mr. Tucker and made known to him the situation of Mr. Eldridge, and directly asked him if he would be the means of early in- troducing Mrs. Eldridge to the parish. After a few mo- ments' deliberation he expressed his readiness to move if his wife would consent; but suggested that he thought she might not be disposed, as she was now well satisfied with her house. The matter being laid before her by Mr. Tucker and the squire, she at once manifested an unwillingness to leave her present abode. However, after further consul- tation and by a liberal offer the squire made Mr. Tucker if he would accommodate Mr. Eldridge with the house, his wife finally yielded, and the Allen house would shortly be vacated. The squire returned home and despatched a note to his pastor, acquainting him with his success and that he could occupy the wished-for house at his own con- venience and pleasure. In about six weeks from this period there might have been seen new furniture carried- into the Alien house, and various other indications of an approaching important event in the history of the new pastor. The Sabbath fol, lowing these indications Mr. Eldridge was not in his   32     A VOICE F11iiOM TIIE PARSONA GE. pulpit, and his place was supplied by'a stranger. Rumor from a hundred tongues had it that the pastor hzad gone to be married. However false and deceitful in relation to ministerial matters this dame often is, yet in the present instance of her cry her report was soon confirmed; for on the next Sabbath the parish pew - which had never known other occupants than such as were attached to the pastor's household - was in the occupancy of two ladies and a gentleman, who, before the services in the afternoon had 'commenced, were generally known as being the pas- tor's wife and her brother and sister. It was amusing to notice the glance of the eyes as they were directed from almost every part of the house to the slip where these strangers were seated. Even the little boys and girls from the galleries might be seen every now and then rising up- and bending their heads and backs down below to catch a glimpse of the object of general curiosity. Nor was all attention confined to the pew. There seemed to be an unwonted attraction in the pulpit; and the pastor had, if not more attention than formerly, yet attention from motives which had not before influenced the hearers. This attention abated not from the commencement to the close of his services ; for there were many there watching for blushes, if not for allusions to the new scenes on which he had lately entered. He, however, evinced both his sense and his thoughts of something beyond what was passing in the minds of many of his auditors. After the manner of many of his brethren in similar circumstances, Mr. El- dridge did not take for his text, "I am the rose of Sharon, and -- is the lily of the valley ;" nor, "He setteth the solitary in families ;" nor, "I have married a wife." Nor was his subject the government of a household, which some clergymen have been known to discuss on the first Sab- bath of their appearance in the house of God with a wife. Mr. Eldridge wisely avoided all such themes, and so went   MARRIAGE AND HOUSEKEiPING.     8y through with the various services of the day, that a stranger present left the house unimpressed that any thing had happened to the pastor of late more than a new unc- tion from the holy One. Upon the conclusion of the services and when the con- gregation were in motion, there were more than the usual groups along the aisles, in the entry, on the steps, and in the yard of the church. It was, therefore, unavoidable not to overhear some of the conversation which was so eagerly escaping; and much that was heard pertained to the marriage of the minister and the appearance of the wife. "Did you see her?" might often be heard. Like- wise, "How do you like her looks?" "I guess she'll an- swer," &c. In the evening at Squire Davidson's, the Connecticut custom in that family prevailing of " keeping Saturday night," the conversation turned on the pastor and wife and such remarks of the people Concerning them as had that day been heard. The squire's pew. being at the right of the pulpit, afforded a fine view of the one occupied by the family of the clergyman, so that the eye would in- voluntarily fall upon the latter from the former. The Davidsons, therefore, could notice, without any particular effort, the countenance, dress, deportment, &c., of the pas- tor's wife. Ann, in answer to the question addressed to her by her husband, "What did you think of the appearance of Mrs. Eldridge?" remarked,- "I was somewhat disappointed ; she did not appear as I expected." "What was the matter?"Charles asked. "Was she not as handsome as you had supposed? or was she not dressed so elegantly?" "There was nothing very elegant about her dress,"   34     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. Frances remarked. "I wonder if she was married in that dress. I presume, however, she was not." "What kind of a dress had she on,?" aunt Sarah in- quired. "It was a light-colored, figured silk, aunt, very plainly made, and did not appear like a wedding garment," Fran- ces replied. "I rather think it was her wedding dress," Mrs. David- son observed; "and it was no ordinary one either, if I am any judge. It is true, it was not trimmed in the very height of fashion; but I dare say it cost much more than many a dress which you, Frances, would decide to be far more expensive. It was a very suitable dress, and I ad- mired it very much indeed." "What did you think of her bonnet, Frances?"Charles asked. "O," Frances said, "I thought that was very beautiful." "What did you think of her face, daughter?" asked the squire. "She has no beauty to spare," Frances replied. "Was there no beauty in her eye, my daughter?" the squire continued. "I thought she had a rather pleasant eye, father." "Yes, I thought so too," the squire observed ; " and I thought that she, appeared remarkably well. I have no( doubt that she is a lady of very good sense and worthy of the position in which she is now placed." "Yes," added Mrs. Davidson; " that is my opinion. I was very much pleased with all that I saw. Every thing about her indicated worth, and made me anxious to be- come acquainted with her." "They will have a levee soon, will they not, father," Charles inquired, "to afford the people an opportunity to be introduced to their minister's wife?"   MARRIAGE AN'D HOUSEKEEPING.     35 "There will be something of the kind, I presume, from a remark made to me by Mr. Eldridge yesterday," the squire said. "He remarked, he thought it might be well for the people to become acquainted with his wife at once, and he had concluded to give a general invitation to all to visit them next week, Tuesday." The Tuesday came, and the invitation to the parsonage was very generally accepted by the people of the parish. The entire house was thrown open, and the good ladies had the privilege of going .whither they pleased- to notice all the furniture and conveniences of the premises. Mrs. El: dridge was introduced to all, and acquitted herself to the entire satisfaction of that portion of the parish represented by suchi individuals as Squire Davidson and wife. There were those present, however, who took exceptions to her character and appearance. Some affected 'to think she was not equal to her position because she did not dis- close all that she knew at once. The reserve, ever the mark of merit and the ornament of character when it ap- pears in a stranger placed in circumstances like those which then surrounded the young wife of the pastor, was interpreted as the result of inability to converse. Some thought Mrs. Eldridge was not sufficiently respectful to her company because her dress was not all puffs, laces, and embroidery.  Some thought she was too old womanish be)cause her attentions were so many to the aged who Awdere around her. Some thought she was small and con- tra cted, because, in providing for the comfort and pleasure of her guests, her own  hands sometimes aided and not those of a  servant always. The good young wife little thought of the variety of remark of which she was the sullbject in the little circles which were forming in different rooms by the people who were passing to and fro about the 'e se; Iand, had she been, all the while conscious of the :'rutiny w lnich was constantly upon her, her movements   36     A VOICE PFROM THE PARSONAGE. could not have been more judicious nor her speech more becoming in the view of such as were competent to pass an opinion in any way entitled to regard. The company continued till a suitable hour in the even- ing, when the pastor made some fitting remarks, closing them with prayer. Then the more advanced in years be- gan to retire, and the remainder followed their example I and soon the house showed only the confusion of chaio and fragments of refreshments, some on tables, some on carpets and window casements, that significantly admon- ished Mrs. Eldridge what might be her employment on the morrow if not on the day succeeding that. About four weeks from- this gatheringtat the parsonage there was a small company at the house of Deacon Smith, invited out of respect to the pastor and wife. The David- sons were there, and some others about the " centre," and the others were from families in the immediate vicinage of the deacon. In the course of the afternoon many of the company found themselves remarking upon the manner in which Mrs. Eldridge was received and upon different opinions that had been expressed respecting her. At length Mrs. Davidson and Mrs. Smith were left so near each other and so distant from others that their conversa- tion could not well be overheard, when Mrs. Smith ob- served,- "How foolish it is to make such a hue and cry because Mrs. Eldridge has no one to assist her but that little girl!" "Ah," responded Mrs. Davidson, "I have not heard any thing of it. You know I have been away three or- four weeks with my husband to Connecticut and New York, and I have heard nothing of what has been passing in the parish. What do they say?" , 'i There is much said," Mrs. Smith remarked. "A great many don't like it at all that Mrs. Eldridge does not have   MARRIAGE AND HOUSEKEERPING.     37 a woman, in her family to do her work. They say her sphere ought to be out of the kitchen and abroad in the parish. Whilst she is confined with domestic cares her influence over the people is lost." "I cannot think,' said Mrs. Davidson, "that there are many-who feel thus: at least not many sensible people. Only think, there are but two of them in the family, and the house is so convenient that the work is most easily done. Who are they who feel as you describe?" "There are Mrs. Gray, Mrs. Jones, Mr. Otis, and many others who have said much about it." "Does .Mrs. Jones allow herself to censure Mrs. El- dridge for this?" inquired Mrs. Davidson, "I am aston- ished at her. I am not at all surprised that the others are disposed to find fault. I don't think they are alto- gether prompted to their censures by any strong desire for Mrs. Eldridge's usefulness in the parish. Some other feeling is with them." "What feeling?" asked Mrs. Smith, "Pride has something to do in this matter," Mrs. Da- vidson continued, "and an unwillingness to have our pas- tor lay by any thing from his salary. You know how very proud Mrs. Gray is. She thinks it very derogatory in a lady, and especially in a minister's wife, to do any thing that is menial." "If she thinks so," Mrs. Smith observed, "it is strange I have never heard her talk about you in this respect; for you know you assist very much in the work of your family. Perhaps there is no lady in town who is more conver- sant with the labors of the kitchen than yourself." "I hope there is none who is less conversant," Mrs. Da- vidson remarked, " who has a family as large as mine. I do not know how we should get along if we trusted en- tirely to servants. Mrs. Gray may take exceptions to my 4   38     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGEI course if she pleases, and may rail about my working in the kitchen; but I think she will speak rather low, so that I shall not hear of it. I cannot understand why Mrs. Jones, who is distinguished for good sense, should feel as she does." "There, are her daughters, you know; and they have such feeling as that which you say affects Mrs. Gray," said Mrs. Smith. "Yes, O, yes," returned Mrs. Davidson; "that is the reason, is it not? How much Mrs. Jones is influenced by her daughters!" "Who do you think there is unwilling that our minis- ter should be any the richer for his salary?"Mrs. Smith inquired. "Mr. Otis is," Mrs. Davidson replied. "He objected, you know, to giving Mr. Eldridge more than six hundred dollars. When told that such a sum would be insufficient, he said he could not think but that Mr. Eldridge might live with such a salary. He was told that he might possi- bly live, butQ that he ought to do more-than barely make the two ends of the year meet- he ought to lay up a part of his income. -To this Mr. Otis objected most earnestly, and said a minister ought not to desire to grow rich-he ought not to lay up a cent." "That is something new to me," Mrs. Smith remarked. "Mr. Smith never mentioned this to me. How very un- feeling, such a remark I Mr. Otis must have changed his opinion of a minister's duty lately, I think. How he for- merly censured Mr. Eldridge's predecessor for his extrav- agance! How many times I have heard him say that he ought to look out for a rainy day and lay by something for a time of need!"  "Ah, you well know what Mr. Otis is," Mrs. Davidson said, with a somewhat elevated tone, caused by an excess of feeling.   MARRIAGE AND HOUSEKEEPING.     39 By this remark the attention of some of the company was arrested, particularly that of Mrs. Bates, an elderly member of the church and a most worthy mother in Israel. Changing her position that she might have her curiosity gratified by being- near Mrs. Davidson and her friend, she asked, - "What is it about Mr. Otis? Has he begun again?" "Have you not heard," inquired Mrs. Davidson, " that some of our people are pretty severe in their remarks about our minister's wife because she don't have a hired woman?" "O, yes," replied Mrs. Bates; "I have heard of this; but I do not consider it worthy of notice." "I think as you do," said Mrs. Davidson. "Now, I think," continued lArs. Bates, "that I am as well informed in relation to this matter as some others. I called upon Mrs. Eldridge last week, and, seeing a little girl busily sewing there, I asked Mrs. Eldridge who she was. In reply, she said 'that Mr. Eldridge and herself had had much conversation upon the matter of expenses, and that he had seen how often ministers had become in- volved in great trouble by extravagant and injudicious- expenses. and by being negligent of pecuniary concerns, and that he had determined to strive against this source of difficulty by being prudent and careful. In this feel- ing Mrs. Eldridge said she most truly sympathized with her husband, and she said to him that there was one item of expense which might be avoided ; and that was, a hired woman. .She said she told Mr. Eldridge that if she had a little girl to assist she might be able to do the work of the family. He started many objections to this course. He asked her what she would do when she was invited out, when the sewing circle met, &c. She told him she thought some way for her accommodation, when it was v   40     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE, necessary for her to be abroad, could be devised. Soon Mrs. Eldridge said she had a call from Mrs. Darling, who manifested great interest in their welfare, and regretted that it was not in her power -to contribute more towards Mr. Eldridge's salary. She said that perhaps she could assist her some in sewing, &c. Mros. Eldridge then said that she thought Providence was smiling on her endeavors at retrenchment, and she at once disclosed to Mrs. Dar- ling her plan of dispensing with the services of a hired woman and ,of having a little girl to assist her. In such circumstances it would be a great favor to have her come in occasionally and assist her when it was necessary for her to be abroad. Mrs. Darling assented most cheerfully to this proposition, and said, as she lived so near, she could come in any time. Mrs. Eldridge then told her that, if she thought it would be in her power thus to accommo- date her, she would say to her girl that she could leave before the expiration of her month - for which time she was engaged-if she was disposed, and return to her father's, whose family she left very reluctantly to accom- modate them. The next day after she had this conversa- tion with Sally they heard of this little girl, whom they had taken Lto remain with them till she was eighteen years of -age. I told, Mrs. Eldridge," said Mrs. Bates, " that I commended very highly her prudence, and that I thought she had acted very wisely. Do you think, ladies, that I did wrong?" "No, no, by no means," both Mrs. Davidson and Mrs. Smith at once exclamimed. ' I think," said Mrs. Smith, " that Mrs. Eldridge is a very uncommon young lady; and I in-tend to stand by her firm- ly, and, if need be, to say some things to those people who are censuring her on account of her domestic arrange ments whioh may not be very pleasant to them."r   MARRIAGE AND HOUStKI:PrING.     41 ' That is right," Mrs. Davidson remarked; "I will be with you. I think we have a rich jewel in the wife of our minister. She has good common sense; and intends to act from principle, I have no doubt. If people find fault with her, I shall think the fault is in themselves." Here tea was announced, and the conversation- was in- terrupted. 4 X    C HAPTER    III. HARMONIOUS STATE OF THE PARISH AND PECULIAR INTEREST IN THE PASTOR. ALTHOUGH, from the description of the manner in which Ms. Eldridge was regarded by some of the parish as given in the preceding chapter, an inference might be" made unfavorable to the popularity of the pastor, yet the inference would not be correct. The individuals who were heard to animadvert with severity upon the wife were loud in their praises of the husband. Their feeling of disapprobation of the former was rather superficial than deep; for, in the course pursued by individuals like Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Davidson, it was not many months before it all died away, and not a whisper was heard to the disadvantage of Mrs. Eldridge. From many expres- sions, moreover, from the sources whence formerly pro- ceeded censure, it became evident that mortification for imprudent speech and hasty judgment had, at least for a season, closed the aperture of trouble which on the part of some was feared would eventually prove great. Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Gray, and others, though, as ever, mingling much with the people, were not known to express them- selves as formerly to the discredit of Mrs. Eldridge, but, on the contrary, were heard to speak of her with praise and highly to commend her as a 'lady of great prudence in her domestic arrangements, and well adapted to the (42)   PARISH AND PASTOR.       43 important sphere in which sT'e was called to act. That unanimity in relation to all ministerial concerns was great was acknowledged in all parts of the parish; and it was proverbial in adjacent towns that the people to whom Mr. Eldridge ministered had at length found a clergyman of whom they were all exceedingly proud.' "Father," asked Frances Davidson, about ten months after the settlement of Mr. Eldridge, " why do not our people now build a vestry? You know they tried two or three years since, but failed because our former pastor was so unpopular. I should think there might be one built now, as everybody likes Mr. Eldridge so well." "What should put such an idea into your head, child?" the squire asked. "Have you heard any one speak about building a vestry?" "No, father ; I have not heard a word about it for a long time. The thought came to me just as I was making some preparation for the meeting this evening at tthe town house." "When you asked the question, daughter, I did not know but that you overheard our conversation as you came into the :room when Mr. Sheldon and Deacon Smith were in." "Were you talking about building a vestry, father, this afternoon:?" asked Frances, highly delighted with the prospect. "Yes, daughter; and the parish committee haver this afternoon inserted an article in the warrant for the an- nual parish meeting, which will be held in about two weeks, to see if the people will build a vestry this sum- mer." "I think they will do it, father ; do you not?" "I rather think they will, daughter. We very much need such an accommodation."         ^    "     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "Husband, when are you going to see your old friend Mr. Billings?" asked Mrs. Davidson of the squire one Monday morning. "It is so pleasant to-day; and, as I do not feel very well, I have thought I would propose a ride over there this afternoon." "My dear," the squire replied, " it is our annual parish meeting this afternoon; and I cannot be away from that, you know." "O, I forgot that. No ; you will of course wish to be present. It is singular I should have forgotten it when we have talked so much of the feeling which building a vestry would excite. Well," continued Mrs. Davidson, "I think I will send John with a note to Mrs, Smith, and invite her to ride up here this afternoon with the deacon when he comes to the parish meeting." "I would do so, my dear. I should very much like to have the deacon come in here after meeting and talk over matters." A note was accordingly sent. The invitation was cor- dially accepted ; and Mrs. Smith came early in the after- noon. As Frances had gone out to be absent a short time, there were only Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Davidson, and aunt Sarah together. These friends being very sociable, and were so much engrossed with conversation on sub- jects which exceedingly interested them, that Mrs. David- son was unconscious of the flight of time, and was hence surprised at the appearance of one of her domestics on an errand that denoted the hour for tea to be near. "Is it possible," she asked, " that it is five o'clock?" instantly turning her eye to the clock incased on the shelf. "Dear me I I had no idea it was so late. Well, as it is parish meeting to-day, Mr. Davidson will not be in for tea at the usual hour; and it will be no matter if we are a little tardy." Excusing herself, Mrs. Davidson followed Margaret to   PARISH AND PASTOR.       45 the kitchen, where remaining a few minutes, she returned to the parlor and found Frances in most animated conver- sation with Mrs. Smith and her aunt. "What news now, my daughter?" inquired Mrs. Da- vidson. "O mother, what a large parish meeting they are hav- ing! It seemed like Sunday as I passed the town house, there were so many carriages about. I guess they will have a vestry now." "Perhaps not," aunt Sarah replied. "We can't tell what so many people have come out for. It may be there is warm opposition to the project." "O, no," remarked Mrs. Smith; " if there was opposition, we should have heard of it before this. I presume the people are all in favor of building." "O, I hope they are," Frances said. "I do desire some other place in which to hold our evening meetings than the cold, dirty town house." The company continued variously discussing the proba- bilities of the exciting subject now before the parish meet- ing being favorably received :till the arrival of Squire Davidson and the deacon. As soon as the gentlemen were seated, Mrs. Smith, addressing her husband, inquired how the matter of the vestry was disposed of." "We have decided to build," was the reply. "I am truly rejoiced at this decision," Mrs. Smith ob- served. "That is good news," Mrs. Davidson said. "Yes," said the squire; " it will be a fine thing for the parish; and I feel very grateful that we have so fair a pros- pect for a vestry. We have had a very harmonious and pleasant meeting." "Was there more harmony this afternoon than there was at the meeting at which the people gave a call to Mr. Eldridge to settle?" aunt Sarah asked.   "     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "There could not be more harmony; for the people were unanimous in their call," the squire replied. "There were many more out this afternoon than at that meeting, however." "I thought there was a very large attendance this afternoon, father," said Frances, "as I passed the town house." "Yes, daughter; it was the largest parish meeting that I ever attended. Did you not think it the largest we ever had, deacon?" "' Certainly; by far," the deacon replied. "I was not expecting to see half the number out. It really does me good to see so much interest in our pastor Ss was mani- fested this afternoon." "Was it not wonderful, deacon, that there was no more opposition exhibited?" the squire asked. "I always supposed that we should carry the vote to build by a handsome majority; but I had no idea that it would be unanimous." "Was it a unanimous vote??" aunt Sarah asked. "We must call it so, I think; must we -not, deacon?" "I think so," the deacon replied. "When the con- trary minds were called I did not see any hands raised." "I did not," the squire observed. "I thought that Mr. Otis, Mr. Brown, and Colonel Presbury would certainly vote against building." "Yes," said the deacon; "and Captain Fletcher like- wise." "I did not think of Captain Fletcher," the squire re- marked. "Did you ever know him vote with us before?" "I never did," the deacon said. "I shall almost think that I did not vote right, seeing that he was with me." "I do not much wonder you think so," the squire said. Here the company were summoned to the tea table, at   PARISH AND PASTOB.       47 which little Arthur was seated by the side of his grand- father. As was perfectly natural, Mrs. Smith, knowing that he was no unimportant character in the family, and that he was a bright, well-behaved child, directed her con- versation to him. "Well, Arthur," she said, "don't you get homesick sometimes?" "No, ma'am," he replied, looking up to his grandfather, smiling. "Not much homesick, here with his grandpa," the squire said, as he placed his hand on the head of the little fellow. "He and grandpa have fine times." "Does he love to attend school?"Mrs. Smith inquired of the grandmother. "Yes, pretty well," Mrs. Davidson said. "He some- times, however, requests to stay at home." "Well, I suppose you are not very urgent for him to go at such times," Mrs. Smith said, with a significant smile. "Grandparents are inclined to be indulgent, you know." Little Arthur looked up and burst forth in loud laughter. "What now, dear?" inquired the grandmother. "I was thinking what papa said as he stood on the door- way when he was leaving for home." "What did he say, child? I do not remember." The boy manifesting a little shyness in replying, but be- ing urged to speak by both his grandparents, at length said, - "Don't you remember that papa said, 'Don't spoil 2Arthur now by letting him have his own way, as grandparents are apt to do'?" "O, yes, dear; yes, we remember that." "Well," said the grandmother, "does Arthur think that he is in danger of being spoiled?" Arthur smiled and said, "I don't have to mind here as I did at home, I think."   48     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGE. "The little fellow,"' said Mrs. Davidson, "is here alone, with no young children around; and we can't always re- fuse his requests, you know." "O, no, no," said Mrs. Smith; "' it is notE inthe nature of grandparents to refuse." "I understand," said Mrs. Davidson; "I understand. We'll-see one of these days how Mrs. Smith manages with her grandchildren." "We do not intend to treat Arthur in any very different manner from that in which we treated our own children)" the squire observed. "O, no, I presume not," Mrs. Smith said ; " but somehow or other grandparents -seem to forget how they formerly treated their own children. Don't you think so, squire?" "I don't know," the squire replied, " but that they do. You must not rub us too hard. You know we like to see the little folks enjoy themselves." "That is it," continued! Mrs. Smith. "No wonder grandchildren are so fond of going to see grandpa and grandma. They have fine times together." "I don't think Arthur's grandparents often remember what Charles said to them about being too indulgent," aunt Sarah said, with much gravity and deliberation. "Why so, sister?" the squire asked. "Do you think we are very indulgent?"  "I remember how you formerly brought up children; and I think your present mode of management is very un- like that."                  ! "Well," said the squire, " we will try not to spoil Arthur entirely," as he helped him to a second piece of cake in answer to his request. "There," said aunt Sarah, "what you have now done you never would do to your own children." "O, well, sister, perhaps I am wiser than formerly," the squire replied, with a smile.   PARISH AND PASTORB       49 Arthur having despatched his cake,. betraying all the while the consciousness that he was in pretty indulgent hands, the company retired from the :table. Mrs. Smith remaining with Mrs. Davidson, the squire and the deacon returned to the parlor and resumed conversation on the doings of the parish meeting. At the recital by the dea- con of what he heard Captain Fletcher remark, both gen- tlemen were indulging themselves in a hearty laugh when the ladies entered, "You seem to be very merry, gentlemen," Mrs. Smith observed. "I hope we ladies will not be any interrup- tion." "By no means, madam," said the squire. "Now, husband," said Mrs. Davidson, "let us hear all about the parish meeting. You remarked before .tea that ,the vote to build was unanimous; was there no opposi- tion?"  "Not when the vote was taken. The question was pretty fully discussed, and there were a few who- thought the expense might be avoided. Mr. Otis thought the town ,.would be willing to have the parish repair the town house and control it. If such an arrangement could be made, he argued, it would be better to repair than to build. i Colonel: Presbury took a similar view, and so did Mr. Brown." "These gentlemen did not vote to build,- did they?" Mrs. Smith inquired. "No, madam," the squire said " nor did they vote not to build. They thought something ought to be done, but wished to avoid the great expense required in building a vestry." "They were thinking of their taxes," the deacon said. "I dare say this," Mrs. Davidson observed. "They are always complaining of high town and parish taxes." "What induced Captain Fletcher to vote as he did?" Mrs. Smith inquired. 5 :!   O      AA VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "He surprised us all," the squire replied. "ie not only voted in favor of building, but he advocated the meas- ure in a somewhat lengthy speech." "Captain Fletcher make a speech, father!" said Fran- ces. "What war it?" "He began by remarking,"' the squire said, "that he supposed a vestry would not be of much use to him or any of his neighbors unless ye all alter very much. We have not a very good character there in Hard Scrabble for go- ing to meeting Sundays in the meeting house, or for our treatment of ministers, or for any thing relating to re- ligion; but, said he, we know some things, after all: We can tell a good minister any time by just seeing him. Now, Mr. Moderator, they have got a first-rate minister now, in the opinion of Hard Scrabble folks at least. He has been in that neighborhood and called at every house; and he preached not long ago in the school house there, and we all turned out and filled up the building for him. We all like Mr. Eldridge; and I told my wife, when I saw the warrant up for this meeting, that I meant to go and make a speech and vote to build a vestry for Mr. Eldridge, because I like the man. Now, I have done what I said I would; and I shall vote to build a good large vestry equal to any in "the parts ;" and I see many of my neighbors here who have said that they should vote to build too, because they like the minister. There is Mr. Frost, or, as we call him, the 'general:' he told me that, if I would attend this meeting and make a speech here, he would likewise. Now, I hope the old gentleman won't back out." "Why, Mr. Davidson!" his wife remarked, in a tone of great surprise. "Captain Fletcher did not say all this, did he?" "Certainly he did, my dear, and much more. He spoke for a good half hour, and he astonished us all." ".Were there many down from Hard Scrabble?"Fran- ces inquired.   PARISH AND PASTOR.       51 "Yes, daughter; there were fifteen or twenty." "Did they all vote for a vestry?" aunt Sarah asked. "I presume so," the squire replied. "They all looked interested and pleased." "I -hope," said Mrs. Davidson, " that General Frost, as they call him, did not make a speech as he was challenged to do by Captain Fletcher." "Why not, my dear?" "I should not think a drunkard like him would have influence on any one." "He has left off drinking now, you know," Mrs. Smith remarked. lNo, I never heard of that," Mrs. Davidson said. "It is a fact, I believe," continued Mrs. Smith. "It is pow nearly a year since he has drank any." "That is really cheering intelligence," Mrs. Davidson said ; " and now I hope he did make a speech in the parish meeting." "He did make one," the squire said, "and said many good things which it was interesting to hear. As I re- ported Captain Fletcher, I must ask the deacon to report i the general for the gratification of the ladies." The deacon accordingly proceeded, and -said that Mr. Frost began with saying, - "I did tell Captain Fletcher that, if he came to this meeting and made a speech, I would do the same. I did not think he would come; and. if he came, I did not think that any person in this meeting would expect to hear him speak any more than they would me; and I am sure no one would have expected a speech from me any more than from that old crazy Jenkins who was buried last week. But, Mr. Moderator, here I am; and I will try to say something about building a vestry. I think there ought to be one built. This place is not fit to hold meet- ings in. It is cold and dirty; and there ought to be a   62     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. better place. My daughter comes down here to evening meetings sometimes; and she complains because it is so uncomfortable and not clean. Mr. Otis pretends that the town would consent to have this building repaired; but I am opposed to the town's business being done by the par- ish. I go for a new vestry. I .think we ought to build one because they tell me the minister wants one. Mr. Eldridge is a nice man, I believe. I, for one, like him much. He has been up our way and preached in the school house, as the captain told you; and he preached a right smart sermon; and he prayed right smart, too. I tell our folks I must come down here some Sunday and hear him further; and if you build a vestry I ain't sure but that I shall come to the evening meetings sometimes when there is a moon." "The general acquitted himself well," Mrs. Davidson observed. "Certainly he did," the deacon replied. "Mr. Frost is a very sensible man, and, but for his intemperate habits, would have made a very valuable citizen." "I think he would," the squire said. "I've often thought, when he has been in the store, that I did not know of a shrewder man than he." "I hope," aunt Sarah said, " he has reformed and will continue a sober man. Who knows but that he may be a Christian yet?" "Were there any there from Kenyon's Corner, father?" Frances inquired. "Yes, daughter, a large number; and they appeared much interested in having a vestry." "Did any of them say any thing?"Mrs. Davidson asked. i No, dear, not in meeting; but I talked with Mr. Brown, and Mr. Freeman after the meeting was over, who told me they thought the people in that neighborhood were all   PARISH AND PASTOR.       53 in favor of building. They had much to say about Mr. Eldridge, and thought that he was just the man for us." "It seems," Mrs. Smith remarked, " that people in every part of the parish feel as they do in Kenyon's Corner to- wards our pastor. I saw Mrs. Duncan from Union Vil- lage last week, who informed me the people in her neigh- borhood were carried away with Mr. Eldridge." "From all that was said in the meeting this afternoon," the squire remarked, "I judged the people were very much united in Mr. Eldridge, and that their esteem for him was increasing the more they saw of him." "I was similarly impressed," the deacon said. "I think we have great cause for gratitude that such a good minis- ter has been sent us. I do not hear any thing said against Mr. Eldridge; but almost every week I hear much in his favor." "You are very favorably situated for knowing the minds of the people," Mrs. Davidson said; " as almost every family in town sends to your mill." "Did they decide where to locate the vestry?"Frances asked. "O, yes, daughter," the squire said; "they decided to set it where I told you I thought they would - on Mr. Duncan's lot, if he will sell half an acre. I rather think he will; as he is in favor of building and knows that his lot is the best location." "What kind of a building will they erect?" aunt Sarah asked. "A. one-story building," the squire replied, "large enough to have one spacious room and two smaller ones to open into the larger one. These small rooms will be convenient for many purposes. In one of them the Sabbath school library and parish library can be accom- modated. The ladies can hold their sewing circle in one of these small rooms; and, on the Sabbath, the people 5   54     A VOICE FROM TIE PARSONAGE. who do not return home during the intermission can have a very warm and comfortable place in which to remain." "People will be much accommodated by such an ar- rangement," Mrs. Smith observed. "And Mr. Eldridge likewise," said Frances. "He has always wished for a vestry ; and I am much pleased that there is now a prospect of his being gratified." "Had Mr. Eldridge not been very popular throughout the parish we should not have had such a prospect," Mrs. Smith remarked ; " do you think we should, squire?" "We are undoubtedly indebted to his general popular- ity for the vote to build a vestry, j think;" the squire replied. "Most certainly," said the deacon. "We could never have obtained a vote to build had not Mr. Eldridge been very popular in the par!sh."   \ ^   CHAPTER IV. CROOKED STICK. SUCH in every parish as are interested in the ele- sments of its prosperity, and upon whom no small share of responsibility devolves, who look upon the parish with almost the interest with which they contemplate their own families, sensitive to every passing breeze, watching it to discover if health or disease be odorous therein, know full well that there is no parochial union that is impreg- nable, and that, however united a people may be in their pastor to-day, there is no security against disrupture to- morrow. The minister is peculiarly the victim of caprice, of distorted vision, of disappointed hopes, and of diseased ---/,minds and hearts. If there be deaf persons in the parish, he is sure to be reported as having said that of which he never thought and of having omitted to say what he did. If there be hypochondriacs in the parish, in some way or other he approaches them on the dark side; so that he is not seen as he is. If there be great news gath- erers and news spreaders there, he must take it for granted that his presence in the company of such for ten minutes will furnish materials for the gossip of, a week ; and he must not wonder. if some brother minister whom he meets when he next goes to the association should call him to an account for some of his speeches or conduct which are making much excitement in neighboring towns, in relation (55)   56     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. to which he is as disconnected as the missionary to Japan, and of which no mortal ever breathed to him before. If there be vain persons in the parish, -men who are impor- tant only in their own conceit, who have wisdom which they care to' impart and counsel for every emergency, but who, withal, are very careful of their pockets, not exactly understanding how to pay much towards the salary of the pastor, or how to assist in making up any parish arrear-' ages, or do any thing to make all things move onward smoothly and pleasantly,- the minister need not lay it much to heart if he hears from such individuals strange stories and doleful forebodings after any important meas- ure has been adopted, and in relation to which the dea- cons, squires, and other principal men had not seen fit to call upon and consult these wise men previous to the meet- ing at which such measure was carried. We are all famil- iar with the adage, "It fakes all sorts of men to make a world ; and most generally-it can be affirmed of parishes that they are composed of every variety of material. There are times when this: versatile material seems to have a oneness about it; as there are seasons when the sea is tranquil and calm, presenting to the unpractised eye impotency to surge and wave. Clouds, however, often suddenly gather; and where but a  few moments before there was a placid sheet of water, with hardly a ripple to meet the view, may now be seen the mountain wave and the yawning depth. So of parishes where the diversity of material composing it may seem to have no variety    in a  time unlooked for discordant elements may appear, threatening destruction to all which makes pastoral and . ministerial comfort and usefulness secure.       'i A   little more than two years from the settlement of Mr. Eldridge, as little Arthur was on his way from school, he  stopped, as was his frequent practice, at his grandfather's  store to furnish his pockets with a little variety of confec. *, . . ' *"2-s   CROOKED STICK.        57 tionery, to be able to gratify his own appetite as well as a confer ever-welcome gifts upon favorite schoolfellows. There happened to be no one in the store at the- time but his grandfather, Mr. Billings, and Deacon Smith. Little Arthur noticed that his grandfather was a little excited, and, by one of the expressions which escaped the old gen- tleman, he was somewhat impressed. He could not apply it as was his desire, nor decipher it as he tried hard to do ; so, not waiting for his grandfather to accompany him home as usual, - for he saw no indications in him of any thought of dinner,;L he went off alone to his home. As soon as he entered the room where his grandmother was arranging the table he somewhat eagerly and loudly in- quired, - "Grandma, what is crooked stick?" "Crooked stick, child I Don't Arthur know -what that is?" his grandmother said. "Why, it is a piece of wood that is not straight." "Is Mr. Otis a stick of wood, grandma?" "Why do you ask such a question, child?" uttered ,his grandmother. "Mr. Otis is a gentleman, Arthur." Well, then," inquired the little fellow, " what did grandpa mean when he said that Mr. Otis was a crooked stick?" "Did you hear him call Mr. Otis a crooked stick, my child?" "Yes, grandma, I did. I heard him isay so twice just now at the store. He said,' It don't signify ; Mr. Otis is a crooked stick- a crooked stick.'  "Who did he say this to, Arthur?" 4 To Mr. Billings and Deacon Smith, grandma." The grandmother, understanding more than the child, and being grieved with fearful apprehensions of trouble in  the parish, diverted the further curiosity of Arthur by re- ,questing him to go out to the hennery and bring .her in   58     A VOICE FROM3 THE PARSONAGE. some eggs. Whilst the little boy was out the squire came in, and, not seeing Mrs. Davidson or Arthur, he asked aunt Sarah, - "Has not Arthur come home yet?" "O, yes," she replied; "he came home some time ago. His grandmother sent him out just now to look for some eggs. Has any thing new happ ned ,brother?" "Why do you ask such a question, sister?" "O I thought from what Arthur told his grandmother something or other was brewing in the parish." "What did he say?" "He came home and told hbis grandmother that you called Mr. Otis a crooked stick twice; and he wanted his grandmother to explain what you meant." "Well, if he lives as long as I have and has much to do with the world, he'll find out what crooked stick means to his sorrow."                      : "What now, brother?" asked aunt- Sarah, somewhat alarmed at the decided tones of the squire. "What has Mr. Otis been doing?" "O, nothing very alarming, but something very pro- voking," the squire replied. "He wants to have Deacon Smith resign his post as chorister and be succeeded by Mr. Nelson."                    - Mrs. Davidson now entering the room, her husband at once remarked, - "Sister tells me  that Arthur came home with some startling news." "Yes, husband; and pray tell me what the man is up to now."  "I have just*been telling sister about it. Mr. Otis   wishes to have Deacon Smith retire from the seats and have Mr. Nelson lead the singing."           /! "Mr. Nelson!" exclaimed Mrs. Davidson. "Why, he has not been in the parish six weeks yet; and who     - cft   CROOKED STICK.        59 knows what his character is or what his excellence as a singer?" "Who knows?" said the squire, with emotion. "Why, Mr. Otis knows; and that is sufficient." "I thought," aunt Sarah observed, " that Mr. Otis had a very high opinion Aof the deacon as a singer. He was very anxious that he should take the lead." ' He was,v' said the squire, " three years ago ; but I sup- pose he has become tired of the deacon's tunes and wants something new." "Will our people consent to have the deacon give up?" Mrs. Davidson inquired. "This matter of singing," the squire said, "is a delicate affair. The singers must do as they please, or there will be trouble, you know. Mr. Otis has been circulating a paper among them, and several have signed it, in which a preference is given to Mr. Nelson for chorister and a de- sire expressed that he may be appointed." "Who has signed the paper?" "Mr. Cushing, Mr. Everett, Mr. Humphrey, Miss Lord, Miss Simons, and others whose names I have forgotten," the squire said. "Has Mr. Nichols, or Mr. Parker, or Miss Wilson, or Miss Carter?" "No, not either of them, my dear ; and they will not, the deacon tells me. They and many others have been to him to urge him to take no notice of what Mr. Otis is doing. Mr.-Parker told the deacon that Mr. Otis was a crooked stick, always had been, and always would be, till he was straightened in his grave. It was when Mr. Bil- lings was telling me of, this that I said what Arthur men- tioned." Previous to going to the store after dinner the squire proposed to his wife to ride down to Mr. Clay's after tea and spend the evening. Mr. Clay occupied an important *r*        ^   60     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. position in society. Having been liberally educated, and with fair prospects of success in professional life, he was under the necessity, from regard to his health, of not pros- ecuting the study of law, on which he had entered, and of devoting himself to agricultural pursuits. A valuable farm being offered for sale in the town about the time he came to the conclusion to abandon study, and noticing the advertisement in the papers, he was induced, by his knowledge of the scenery about it, and of the character of many of the people of the place, many of whom he person- /  ally knew and had visited, to become its purchaser, He accordingly soon took possession of the same, having pre- viously married a very estimable and pious young lady. He became a resident of the place about two years before the settlement of Mr. Eldridge, and had attained an ex-s tensive influence in the community when this event oc- curred. Both Mr. and Mrs. Clay were ardently attached to Mr. Eldridge, and in every thing relating to his happi- ness they were most deeply interested. Their house was the frequent resort of the pastor and of other individuals who could appreciate intellectual and moral worth. Squire Davidson and wife had not long been seated in the parlor of these friends before Mrs. Clay inquired of Mrs. Davidson if Mr. Parker had called upon them in re- lation to a subscription to procure for Deacon Smith a valuable family Bible in token of the esteem in which he was held for his services as chorister. "Do   you hear that, husband?" said Mrs. Davidson to the squire, who was engrossed in conversation with Mr. Clay. - No, my dear ;  what?" Mrs. Davidson then repeated the remark of Mrs. Clay. "No, Mrs. Clay," said the squire, " we have heard noth-  ing of the kind. It is a very timely manifestation of re- gard for a  most worthy man, and I hope it may do good."   CROOKED STICK. '6a "(Did Mr. Parker say any thing in relation to a desire on the part of some for a new leader of our singing?"Mrs. Davidson inquired. "He did not," Mrs. Clay replied. "He appeared to be in haste and did not stop long. Are not all satisfied with the deacon?" "We never knew of any dissatisfaction with him till to-day," Mrs. Davidson replied. "Who is opposed to him?"Mr. Clay asked. "I believe Mr. Otis is at the bottom of the opposition," the squire said. "The deacon was in at my store this morning somewhat troubled about it'. I never helard of it till he mentioned the subject to me. Hle says that Mr. Otis has been to him and pretty broadly hinted that it would be pleasant to a number of the' singers and many of the people if they could have Mr. Nelson for chorister." "Mr. Parker didn't like this arrangement, I rather think," Mr. :Clay remarked.   / "He does not," said the squire. "He is very much dis- turbed about it, and means to prevent it if possible. I am very glad to hear, as you have informed us, that he is now engaged in obtaining means for showing the deacon how highly he is regarded by us for his services as choris- ter. It is a capital plan." "What kind of a man is this Mr. Otis?"Mr. Clay in- quired. "I never had much acquaintance with him." O., I do not know," the squire said, "He has some good traits of character; but, somehow or other, he has many enemies." "I thought this might be the case by what I have heard," Mr. Clay said. "Mr. Billings was in here the other day highly excited by some of his conduct in rela- tion to the school house they are building in his district; and, from what he said of the man, I could not help think- ing of what my father used to say-of some people." 6   62     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE, "What was that?" the squire asked. "Why," said Mr. Clay, " there was a man in our neigh- borhood who greatly annioyed every one about him by his course in regard to any thing relating to town matters, or school matters, or parish matters. He was never satisfied. How many times I have heard father say he was a crooked stick!" This remark very much excited both the squire and his wife, who at once manifested their emotion by a most hearty laugh, in explanation of which the squire observed, -- "Tha is just the remark some people about here make respecting Mr. Otis. Mr. Billings was telling me to-day that Mr. Parkei had said that Mr. Otis was a crooked stick, always had been, and always would be till he was straightened in his grave. It is a fact, Mr. Clay; that individual is a very troublesome character. There is no dependence upon him. If he is satisfied with'a thing to- day, he may not be to-morrow." "These crooked sticks are very inconvenient," Mr. Clay said. "I suppose Mr. Otis is not the only one-we have among us." "I am sorry to say," said Mrs. Davidson, " that there are others." "There is such a piece in this neighborhood," said Squire Davidson. "Who do you refer to - Mr. Andrews?" "Yes, sir." -' "There is another near you," said Mrs. Clay. - "Mr. Scott; I suppose you refer to," said the squire. "Yes; he is one of this species of timber. If it were not for these men and a few others, and three or four women- in town, - asking your pardon, ladies, - I should have but little fear of any parochial trouble; but now I am in constant apprehension that every month may   AROOKED STICk.        63 start something against Mr. Eldridge that will give us trouble." "I admire your independence, squire," said Mrs. Clay, "in the declaration of the truth, though it brings us ladies under condemnation. I really think there are crooked sticks among us as well as among the gentlemen, and of equal, if not greater, harm sometimes." "Your good sense, madam, is to be applauded," thie squire replied, bowing very pleasantly, " in being willing to admit the truth." "What a dreadful thing it would be," Mrs. Clay ob- served, " if any of our crooked sticks should be the means of the dismission of Mr. Eldridge I " "I know it," Mrs. Davidson replied. "We often speak of it at home." "I think it ought not to be so," Mr. Clay observed, "that one or two individuals can break up the peace of a parish and be the means of the dismission of a pastor." "I know that," the squire said ; "but it is so very often. IX know people ought to rise at once and put these indi- viduals down who are ever ready to make or increase difficulties in a parish; but, for some reason or other, there is often an indisposition on the part of the people to take a firm stand in favor of right and against wrong. Were there firmness on the part of the friends of law and order, and should they manifest their determination to abide by the right and put down the wrong, there would be more security for pastors and more stability for church- es. I suppose the great reason for the apathy of the great body of the people, when a few malcontents have created troubles in the parish with the minister, is their unwilling- ness to be drawn into contention. They do not want to burn their fingers by meddling with the fire, I suppose." "Such conduct, I think, is decidedly wrong," Mr. Clay remarked. "It, involves a species of cruelty which I call   "     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE.. intolerable. When these crooked sticks make al fire-- which might with perfect ease be suppressed at Once if the many would rally to the effort, and thus the peace, comfort, and usefulness of a minister be promoted and con- tinued -the pastor is sacrificed, his family distressed and famished, by reason of the backwardness of the people to interpose and show such crooked sticks their proper places and that they cannot accomplish their disorgan- izing and destructive ends. How such people who are satisfied with their pastor can calmly look on when these destroyers of his prospects, happin a usefulness are at work, and no:tmanifest their indignation and their de- termination to rescue him from their power and preserve him unspoiled, is more than I can reconcile with the exer- cise of a good conscience. When the fire might be ex- tinguished with a very small effort, rather than subject themselves to the least exposure, people suffer it :to burn and :do its worstl " "That is cruel indeed!"Mrs. Davidson exclaimed. "A good minister, one that most of the people love and re- spect, who has been and may long be useful, allowed, with wife and children, to be burned up in a fire kindled by a few uneasy, restless spirits, when with a very little effort it might be put out, and the pastor, his family, and his parish be saved from distress or ruin, - what is such con- duct but extreme cruelty?" "' Well," said Mrs. Clay, "if any of our crooked sticks attempt to make :any such fire 'for our!dear pastor, I hope there are enough of us who will -be ready to sound the Iarm and labor to extinguish it." I fear you would be disappointed," the squire ob- sered. "Though all are ready, :as they think, to pluck ot their eyes for Mr. Eldridge, yet, if the time should ever come when our crooked sticks have made a difficulty with him, I fear there would be an unwillingness on the part   CROOKED STICK.        65 of the great body of the people to interpose. Those who made the trouble would be suffered to work on without resistance from an unwillingness of the people to be drawn into a conflict. People love ease and quietude, and are amazing slow to do or say any thing to jeopardize either. The difficulties with Mr. Eldridge might be exceedingly regretted and the conduct of the individuals making them might be severely censured, and at the- same time there be no disposition to resist and remove them for the purpose of retaining our pastor. People would say,--or, if they ,did not say this, they would act as though they did,--' It is really shameful that there is this trouble with Mr. El- dridge when there is no good reason for it. He has been very useful here; and, but for this opposition from a few restless individuals, he might continue to be useful; but, then, those who are opposed to him will not be tasy till he is dismissed ; and we don't know but that, all things con- sidered, it will be better to let him go than to contend. He is such a good man and such a smart preacher that he would not be troubled any to get another parish, and perhaps a much better one than this."' "If our people ever do act in this manner," said Mrs. Clay, with great decision, "I hope they will be made to smart for it." "You and I will keep a sharp lookout for our crooked sticks, won't we, Mrs. Clay?" said Mrs. Davidson. "That is the only way for a people to do," the squire remarked. "If our parishes would realize the danger they are in of being disturbed by a few uneasy and unprinci- pled persons, and would be resolute in putting down the slightest attempts at disorganization, we should not hear of so many dismissions of ministers. There would be more stability in our churches and a greater permanency to the pastoral relation." 6*   CHAPTER V.* THE PASTOR A MAN OF PRAYER. THE attention of several gentlemen     having been at- tracted to some landed property belonging to the parish of Mr. Eldridge,'who expressed a desire to purchase the same, and for which a liberal sum was offered, a parish meeting was called for the consideration 4o the subject. After suitable discussion it was voted to commit the sale of the land to a committee of which Squire Davidson, Deacons Smith and    Barnes, and  Mr. Clay were a  part. This committee having had three sessions, so far completed the negotiation as to be able with a little further atten- tion to announce to the individuals desiring to purchase their readiness to consummate a sale. They accordingly adjourned their third meeting to the evening on which the next weekly prayer meeting would be held, when, on the conclusion of the services, they would finish what remained to be done for the completeness of their work. At, the termination of the next prayer meeting, Mrs. *In this and a- few subsequent chapters will be presented the elements of Mr. Eldridge's character as they were developed in the course of three years from the commencement of his ministry and which in all parts of the parish were accorded to him. It may be well here to state that, in the subsequent years of his ministry to the same people, instead of waning in the least, this' character shone with a brighter lustre, as was from time to time conceded and with pride acknowledged by his parishioners. The remembrance of this cir- cumstance by the reader will aid much in understanding the sequel. (66)   THE PASTOR A MAN OF PRAYER.      67 Davidson, with her characteristic politeness, invited such ladies as were in the care of the committee to accompany her home and there remain whilst the committee were in session. Accordingly Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Clay accepted the invitation and directly proceeded to the house of Mrs. Davidson, which was situated at but a little distance from the vestry. Upon entering the room they were warmly greeted by aunt Sarah and Miss Frances, and after a little time the whole company were engaged in most interesting conversation. Aunt Sarah, ever interested in things per- taining to godliness, did not long forbear to inquire after the services of the devotional season in which those who had just entered the room had been participating. In re- -,ply to her question, Mrs. Clay remarked,-- "O, yes, Miss Davidson; we have had a most precious meeting this evening, I assure you. I wish it had been in your power to be there. You are not aware what a great loser you are in being unable to unite with us in these weekly seasons of prayer. They are so heavenly and sweet as makes me always regret when they close." "It would be a great privilege, I know," said- aunt Sa- rah, "'to attend these meetings, and I feel it to be a most severe trial in being deprived of it. I rejoice, how- ever, that others are blessed with it and that there is so much spirituality on the part of our church, which makes these prayer meetings so precious." "There might be much more spirituality in the members of the church who attend these meetings," Mrs. Clay re- marked. "I wonder that there is not more, when we have such a godly and praying pastor. It is to Mr. Eldridge that our prayer meetings owe. their interest. Were it not for him, I fear these seasons would not be so profitable as they now are. It always seems to me that his whole soul is absorbed with God and Christ and desires to have all the people urfder the power of religion. I never heard   68     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. a minister pray as he does or seize hold of circumstances and events to interest and excite the people to prayer." "I have always thought," said aunt Sarah, "that our pastor was a very devout man, from his conversation and prayers here when he calls. I am always exceedingly pleased when he comes in, for I know I am to have a rich spiritual feast." "Did you ever know our prayer meetings so fully at- tended, Mrs. Davidson, as they have been almost from the very first of Mr. Eldridge's being with us?"Mrs. Clay inquired. "I am not aware," Mrs. Davidson replied, " that there ever was before so large an attendance when there was no special religious interest." "In a revival season I think I never saw more out," Mrs. Smith remarked, " than are now, or than there have been for most of the time since Mr. Eldridge has been with us. People come from all parts of the town -from Union Village, and even from Hard Scrabble." "You know," said Mrs. Clay, "that it is a very common remark among our people that our minister is great at prayer and makes the prayer meetings very interesting. People in our neighborhood, when they call in to see us, often speak of Mr. Eldridge's prayers and of their deep interest in being present at his prayer meetings. Old Mr. Osgood was in last week, and he had much to say of Mr. Eldridge in this respect." "He was jesting, I suppose," said Frances. "I thought he was at first," Mrs. Clay replied, "and answered him accordingly; but he really seemed hurt that I did not consider him sincere in his expressions of inter- est in Mr. Eldridge." "I ani really glad to hear of this," aunt Sarah said. "Mr. Osgood may be a converted man yet." "I have noticed, of late," said Mrs. Davidson, " that he f/   THE PASTOR A MAN OF PRAYER.       9  has been at meeting on the Sabbath, and thought that the /  circumstance denoted interest in Mr. Eldridge." "O, he is' much interested in him," Mrs. Clay said. "There can be no mistake about this. He has had much to say of a visit Mr. Eldridge made lately at his house, and he thinks him the best minister he ever knew."   "If I mistake not," said Mrs. Smith, "I have seen him out lately at some of our prayer meetings." "Yes," replied Mrs. Clay. "He has been there several  times; and he tells me he intends to go as often as he can, he is so much pleased with Mr. Eldridge's prayers and   i exhortations." "I think this intelligence of Mr. Osgood is very en- couraging," said Mrs. Davidson, "If Mr. Osgood is interv ested in Mr. Eldridge's services, we can hope that all oth- ? ers will be who have hitherto been indifferent to religious ; concerns."                        , "Certainly," said aunt Sarah, " there is reason for such , a hope; for I always supposed Mr. Osgood to be almost, if not quite, an infidel." "O yes," saiday; "he was an infidel at the time Mr. Eldridge was ordained, and had been such for many years; he has often told me this. He has told me that he heard so much about Mr. Eldridge's prayers and other services that he thought he would go and hear him preach. After going once he wanted to go again; and so, he said,' I have got to be a pretty constant hearer. I think he is a good man if there be one on earth, and that he is very sincere; and I can't help feeling sometimes when I hear him pray."' ".Mr. Osgood may be the means of inducing others .ver whom he has influence to follow his'example," aunt Sa- rah said.    "That is very probable," said Mrs. Clay. I think h? has attempted th persuade some of his companions in siD   70     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGRE. to go to meeting. He told me that he thought he should see Mr. Tibbits in church before long." "He was there last Sabbath," Frances said. "O, yes," Mrs. Davidson remarked; "I saw him there, i and was much surprised. Mr. Osgood was the mealns un. doubtedly of his attendance. That will be a happy cir- cumstance for Mrs. Tibbits. How much she has desired that her husband would attend church!" "If Mr. Osgood has become interested in going to meet- ing," said aunt earah, "I presume his family will be more happy than formerly." "They are so already," Mrs. Clay replied. "You can- not imagine what a new face Mrs. Osgood now wears. You know how sad, dejected, and forlorn she formerly appeared; and now she is cheerful, sociable, and very happy." -"Poor womain!" said Mrs. Davidson; " how much she has suffered in years past! She formerly was in the habit of coming here to tell us something of her trials. Her husband, when he saw her with the Bible, would be in the greatest rage, would seize the book and wrest it from her, and then would tear it up leaf by leaf and put it into the fire. She has told me that he has destroyed several Bi- bles for her in this manner! He would storm most blas- phemously about religion, and ministers, and every thing connected with the Bible." "Indeed!"Mrs. Clay said, mournfully. "I never heard any thing of it before." "It is all true," aunt Sarah said. "I never pitied a woman more in my life than I have Mrs. Osgood. She told me once that her husband was so incensed at his little boy for crying hard to go to meeting that he took him and gave him the most severe whipping that he ever gave one of the children, and that weeks passed before the little fellow recovered from the effects of the blows."   THE PASTOR A MAN OF PRAYER.     71 "O dear me!" said Mrs. Clay. ( How could he be so cruel? He does not appear like such a man now." "He is not naturally a cruel man," aunt Sarah said; "but he is very excitable, and he was formerly bitter in his opposition to the Bible, Sabbath, and every thing con- nected with religion." "What you have now said," Mrs. Clay remarked, "ex- plains some things Mr. Osgood has said to me. He has told me that he has not done just right in time past about going to meeting himself and having his family go like- ; wise; but I thought he did not refer to any thing uncom- mon that he may have done in the matter." "O, he did, I think," said aunt Sarah. "'He doubtless thought how wickedly he had acted towards his wife and children. I rather think he has not much pleasure in thinking of what he formerly did to them." "Well, if he now sees his wrongs and repents of them, that is encouraging," Frances said. "It is truly so," Mrs. Smith replied; " and we ought to be grateful that God has sent us a minister to be instru- mental of good to such a man as Mr. Osgood." "We ought so," Mrs. Davidson remarked. "There is no earthly blessing more to be valued than a devout and devoted minister." ' I think," said aunt Sarah, "it must be acknowledged  that our pastor is all that." "Yes," Mrs. Smith said. "People in all parts of the parish will acknowledge this to be true of Mr. Eldridge. Mr. Kent, who lives near us, remarked in at our house, not long since, that he heard more said of Mr. Eldridge's prayers than he ever before heard of the prayers of 'all other ministers."                    :, "That is considerable for him to say," Frances replied. "I did not know that he could use his tongue for any other purpose than to speak of making money." ,  .i   72 '    A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE, "Why, Frances I " exclaimed her mother. "Are you not rather severe??" "Well, Mrs. Smith," said Frances, "does Mr. Kent have much to say about any thing but his bargains and property?" "Property is a pretty engrossing subject with him, I confess," Mrs. Smith replied, "Then, mother," said Frances, "do you think I was much out of the way?" "O," said Mrs. Davidson, "I never knew much of Mr. Kent. I seldom see him but at church." "Nor do I," said Frances; "and Sunday noons, when I come out from the Sabbath school, I frequently overhear some of his conversation as he stands about the door or in the yard, and it is all about what he has bought or is intending to buy, or something similar." "You have a pretty correct idea of the man," Mrs. Smith said, smiling. "Mr. Kent, then, thinks our minister is a prayerful man?" said aunt Sarah. "O, yes," said Mrs. Smith. "He had considerable to say about Mr. Eldridge in this respect. He told me that Mr. Lawrence said to him lately, that, if he should happen to be a special subject of Mr. Eldridge's prayers, he would : surely be converted. He asked me if I thought Mr. El- dridge prayed much in private." "That is rather a singular question," Mrs. Davidson re- marked; "and an impertinent one likewise, I should think." Perhaps Mr. Kent had better inquire of the little girl who lives with Mr. Eldridge," aunt Sarah said. "She might give him a little insight into Mr. Eldridge's private devotions." "What do you refer to?" asked Mrs. Davidson. "Does little Maria talk about Mr. Eldridge in this respect?"   THE PASTOR A MAN OF PRAYER.     73 Aunt Sarah, with a smile, proceeded to say that last week, when Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge called to leave the lit- tle girl to remain here whilst they were away from town, she had considerable conversation with her about the min- ister's family. 'I do not now remember what occasioned the remark; but the little girl said, ' JMr. Eldridge prays a great deal in his study.' I asked her how she knew that he was praying, and not reading aloud. '0,' said she, 'I hear him say, "O Lord, I beseech, I pray," &c.' I asked her if he prayed every day. She replied that she hears him very often at prayer." "Maria would not be bad authority in the case, I con- fess," said Mrs. Smith. "I rather think I will refer Mr. Kent to her if he ever should ask me the question against "You never told me, sister, of this conversation with Maria. She told you this when I was out, I suppose," re- marked Mrs. Davidson. "O, yes, you were out," said aunt Sarah, "I remember. I never thought it worth while to repeat what the child said, and should not now have done so but for the ques- tion which Mr. Kent put to Mrs. Smith. She gave me no new information. I took it for granted that Mr. Eldridge was a very devoted closet Christian." "O, yes," said Mrs. Clay; "his sermons prove this. He could not produce the sermons that he gives us were he not assisted in his preparations from above." "He could not, indeed," Mrs. Davidson said. "Any Christian can see from his whole manner that he enjoys refreshings from his Savior of no ordinary character." Mr. Clay now entering the room where the ladies were sitting, unaccompanied by- either the deacon or the squire, a little concern was manifested by Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Davidson at the cause of the protracted absence of their respective husbands, This was, however, at once abated by the remark of Mr. Clay that the deacon had gone to 7   74     A VOICE FRIOM TIIE PFARISONAGEE, the store to make a few purchases, and that the squire accom- panied him. The conversation of the company was then , directed to the business which ---had been occupying the com nittee and to other desultory subjects, which afforded them both entertainment and instruction for nearly an hour. Mrs. Smith at last became impatient for the ar- rival of her husband, knowing that she had three miles to ride before reaching home. Looking at the clock and seeing that the hour was nearly that of ten, she remarked, - "I should really like to know what detains Mr. Smith till this late hour." "You need not be concerned about him," said Mrs. Da- vidson; "for he is in good company." Soon, however, all anxiety was removed by the presence of the tardy husbands; and Mrs. Davidson at once re- marked,- "Your wife, deacon, has been much alarmed about you to-night, and I did -not know but that I should have to send for you." "It is rather a late hour at which to be three miles from home, I confess," said the deacon; " but I could not very well break away before." "What has detained you, husband?"Mrs. Smith in quired. "Mr. Osgood was in the store," the deacon replied, "who had considerable lhe seemed very anxious to commu- nicate; and so we remained to hear." "Ah," exclaimed Mrs. Clay, with a glow of the deep- est interest, " lIave you been conversing with Mr. Osgood? He interested you, I presume, judging from the pleasant interview I had with him last week when he called at our house." "What he said was very encouraging," the deacon re- marked. "I had no idea the man was in such a state of mind.'   THE PASTOR A MAN OF PRAYER.     75 "What is his state of mind?"Mrs. Davidson inquired with much feeling. "He hopes he has become a Christian, ma'am; and he is full of wonder at the mercy of God for having continued him so long in the world, when- his sins have been so great. He wept like a child as he spoke of his former treatment of his wife and children, and of his own expres- sions about God, the Bible, ministers, and all things of a religious character." "Indeed! Is that possible? can it be true?" said Mrs. Davidson. "Is any thing too hard for the Lord?" aunt Sarah in- quired. "Wonderful, it is wonderful, if Mr. Osgood has become a Christian," exclaimed Mrs. Davidson. "Yes," the squire remarked, " it is wonderful ; but I really believe Mr. Osgood is a newSman. His conversation de- notes great sincerity and very deep feeling. He observed that he had been interested in religion for two or three years; that what excited this interest was, noticing how much importance Mr. Eldridge attached to prayer when he called at his house, and how earnest and sincere he was when praying for all the falnily, and especially for himself. Said he, "When Mfr. Eldridge first called at our house there was something in his appearance that, made me almost love him; and dwhen he called again and I sawE more of him, I was almost afraid to be where he was, 1 felt so ashamed of my past life; but,' said he, 'I wanted to hear him pray; for I felt that he was no hypo- crite. If I had not been persuaded that he was a very godly and prayerful man, he never would have interested me more 'tlthan other ministers have done., I have ever been pleased to have Mr. Eldridge call and to be where he is.' Said he, 'Squlire, you never saw me at meeting much till since Mr. Eldridge was settled, and you never   76     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. saw me at a prayer meeting till lately; and I bless God that he sent Mr. Eldridge here; for no one else could have made the impressions on me which that man has."' "Has Mr. Osgood seen our pastor lately?" aunt Sarah inquired. "I asked him that question, sister, and he said that he had not. He said that it was not a week since he in- dulged a hope that he was a Christian, and that he had had no time since to see Mr. Eldridge or hardly any one else." "What great good Mr. Osgood may yet be instrumental in doing!"Mrs. Davidson said. "It appeared to be a great object with him," said the squire, " to endeavor to do good. He told us that he had, in years past, labored hard to prejudice his friends against religion, but that now he intended to labor as hard to per- suade them to seek religion. He said he had already had conversation with several of his acquaintance upon the subject." "I dare say," said aunt Sarah, " that we shall soon hear of more cases like this of Mr. Osgood." "It is to be hoped so," Mrs. Smith remarked. "Mr. Eldridge will be much encouraged, and so will others." "Mr. Osgood," the deacon observed, " thinks that we shall soon have a great revival. He says people are very much interested in the minister, and are persuaded that he is a very holy and prayerful man, and are led to think much of what he says to them on this account." "I think there is now very good reason to expect a re- vival," said aunt Sarah. "I have long thought we should have one in answer to our pastor's prayers, if not to those of any others'." I,   CHAPTER VI. THE PASTOR A SOUND THEOLOGIAN AND DILIGENT STUDENT. IT was an article of agreement with Mr. Eldridge at the periodof his settlement that he should have an annual vacation of four weeks at any period of the year which would best accord with his interest or pleasure. This va- cation he highly valued as furnishing him with an opportu- nity to relax from his severe pursuits. He improved it in visiting cherished friends and such places as would allow him, without much intellectual effort, to be adding to his storehouse of knowledge. One such period of respite from parochial toil he passed on the consecrated hill where he pursued his preparatory theological studies. Another found him at the Capitol of his country, the at tentive listener to important debates in Congress by men whose eloquence and fame were the pride of their con stituents and the glory of the nation. The vacation he took in the fourth year of his pastorate was spent among the hills of his native state, at the home of his childhood and youth. That his wife and children might have the benefit of the journey and the pleasure of knowing the scenes and the places which in his boyish days had en- grossed so many of his hours, he made this journey in a private carriage. A licentiate from Andover, whose parents resided in an adjacent town, was engaged by the parish committee to 7 *     -        (77)   78     A VOICE FROMi THE PARSONAGE. supply the pulpit of the pastor for the Sabbaths he might be absent. As one of these Sabbaths would be the regu- lar period for the communion service, Mr. Eldridge sug- gested that the young man might effect an exchange for that day with his own pastor, the Rev. Mr. Fisher; which was accordingly done. As the house of Squire Davidson was near the church, and Mr. Fisher being in feeble health, he was directed to make this hospitable mansion the place of his rest and refreshment. If such direction had not been given, the horse of Mr. Fisher, which had often tested the horsepitableness about the'premises of the squire, would have made it difficult for his driver to pass the gate without a more resolute exercise of the whip than a cler- gyman would care to practise on a Sabbath morning, especially when such driver would account it a fortunate event thus to be brought up at the door of the individual who was known in all the region as the warm friend of the ministry. After service in the afternoon, as the squire and Mr. Fisher were sitting together, the latter remarked, - } "I perceive, squire, you take the New York Quarterly, probably for the sake of enjoying the articles which your pastor furnishes from time to time." "Is Mr. Eldridge a contributor to the pages of that work?" the squire exclaimed, with much surprise. "Were you not aware of that?" in as much astonishment, though assumed, Mr. Fisher inquired. "I was not," most certainly," the squire replied. "Mr. Eldridge never mentioned to me that he was a writer, for that work.  For the life of me I cannot see when he finds time to write for any thing else than for his pulpit." "That is a capital article of his in the last number on I decrees," Mr. Fisher continued. "Did Mr. Eldridge write that?" eagerly inquired the squire. ' That is from his pen," Mr, Fisher rejoined. ,   THE PASTOR A THEOLOGIAN AND STUDENT.   79 "' I thought that article," the squire said, " the best of -the entire number. I was exceedingly interested in it- so much so that I requested my wife and sister to listen to me as I read it to them." "That is my opinion, squire. I think there is no other article in that number equal to this written by Mr. El- dridge, both as to literary and theological merit. Your pastor is getting to be one of our best theologians." "I have thought for some time," said the squire, " as I -have heard different ministers speak of him, that he was much regarded as a scholar." "O, yes," Mr. Fisher said ; " and as a theologian like- wise. There is no individual in the association more con- fided in for correct opinions on theological points than Mr. Eldridge. If we have him to agree with us we feel that we are not heretics." "What is his signature?" the squire asked, at the same time rising to take the quarterly from the table. "CALVIN," was the reply. "O, yes, I see," said the squire, as his eye glanced at the article. "I have read a large number of communica- tions over that signature in this work. Are they all from our pastor? I have often told my wife that Calvin was the best writer of the lot, and that I really would like his acquaintance." "You will not need any introduction to him, you see," Mr. Fisher remarked. "No - no, sir," the squire replied; "I am very happy to know that I am already well acquainted with Calvin. I hope I shall ever value him as he deserves. He is the author, then, of that series of articles on sin," the squire continued, highly delighted at the discovery of the writer who had interested himii so imuch. "I perceive," Mr. Fisher said, " that you are somewhat   80     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. interested in the nice points of theology, being pleased with these articles on decrees and on sin. It is not often that I meet with a layman whose attention is particularly taken by such subjects." "I suppose you ministers think that we common people know but little on any other subject but that which re- lates to our own business," the squire said, with a rather comical expression of countenance, but with great good "That is very far from being the case with me, I assure you," Mr. Fisher replied. "All that I intended was, that such articles as those referred to, being foreign to the busi- ness of other men than clergymen, would not be likely to attract the interested attention of any but ministers."! "O, I  understand perfectly," said the squire. "It is not often that I find a layman who is equally interested with myself in such subjects. Perhaps the reason for this is, that I am oftener favored with the society of clergy. men than most laymen." "I am well aware, my good sir," said Mr. Fisher, " that theze is a  prophet's chamber in your house, and that your hospitality to clergymen is often the subject of their most grateful remark. It is not, therefore, surprising that you should, by your frequent intercourse with ministers, be much in sympathy with them, not only in their trials, but in their reflections upon subjects which most interest them." "I am obliged to you," returned the squire, "for the honor you do me by your remark." "Those articles of Mr. Eldridge must have cost him great research and study," Mr. Fisher observed. "I sup- pose he exchanges frequently; does he not?" "It is very seldom that we hear any other voice in our pulpit but that of our pastor," the squire replied. "He does not exchange more than eight or ten times in the *          y   THE PASTOR A THEOLOGIAN AND STUDENT.  81 year. He never preaches old sermons that we know of; and it is seldom that he preaches without notes;" "He is an uncommon man, I confess," Mr. Fisher said. "He must be a most diligent student." "That he must," said the squire, " to accomplish for the people here what he does. I have often wondered how he could produce the discourses he gives us with all those interruptions to study which the care of our large parish brings to him. Really, I am at a loss to determine when he finds time to write for the press." "He writes, not only for this review, but for others," Mr. Fisher observed. "One of the most important dis- cussions which we have had of late is indebted to your pastor for its chief interest and victory. He demolished every argument of his opponents, and made the old-fash- ioned New England theology stand aloft and clear of all the trappings which sophistry and heresy had intwined about it." "You very much surprise me," the squire said. "It is very singular I never heard of this before. I shall begin to fear that we shall not have our pastor long if he is such a man with his pen as you have proved him to be." "It is by no means singular that you were ignorant of your pastor's efforts which I have now mentioned," said Mr. Fisher. "I do not think there are five individuals who know of them ;, and I would not have been the means of adding you to the number were it not that I know con- fidence can be placed in you." "I thank you, sir, for the compliment. If it, be impor- tant that the matter be preserved from the public, of course I will not speak of it. Why does Mr. Eldridge wish to be unknown in his character as a writer for the press?" the squire inquired. "He has told me that he only livedfor his people,' Mr. Fisher responded; "that he did not wish for the   82     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. annoyance that would be about him were it known that he wrote for the press. He remarked that he saw the points in the case with different optics from some who had par- ticipated in the controversy, and that he thought he would -present what he saw, hoping to be the means of scattering at least some clouds, if not of producing a clear sky. You need have no apprehension, sir, of losing your minister, as you have just now expressed, in his being called to an- other sphere of duty; for I have heard him repeatedly declare, that, when he had done with his parish,e e had done with every thing of a public character." "I am glad to hear this last remark," the squire ob- served. "I trust it will be long before he will have fin- ished his labors in his parish - most sincerely I do." "I presume such is your wish and expectation," Mr. Fisher replied, " and that there is no reason to apprehend that, from any action of your parish, there will be a suc- cessor to Mr. Eldridge till death has made a vacancy here in the pastoral office." "Though at present I am not aware of any dissensions in the parish relative to Mr. Eldridge," the squire re- marked, "yet who can tell what a day may bring forth? There is such a disorganizing spirit now prevalent in the community as makes it uncertain how long any pastor will remain with his people. Were our blessed Savior now on the earth and in the pastoral office, I fully be- lieve he would have no better assurance of permanency than he had when he went from city to city in the days of his stay on the earth. People at the present day, for a slight cause, or for no cause at all, forget the worth of a pastor which had been unanimously conceded for years, and turn him off with all the coolness and indifference that would be manifested in parting from a foreigner of a few days' acquaintance." "You have not- much sympathy, I perceive, with the   THE PASTOR A THEOLOGIAN AND STUDENT.   83 spirit of which you speak," Mr. Fisher observed. "I think your influence would preserve quiet here were there, an attempt to disturb the elements." "I cannot agree with you at all;" the squire said. "Cer- tain elements exist in our parish, which, if roused, would ride over me, and all others like, me, in attempts to preserve quiet. Every parish is like a volcano ; and the minister is never secure against an eruption. I am glad we have such a faithful pastor and such a thorough and accom- plished theologian as Mr. Eldridge is reputed to be abroad. I hope he will not injure his health by his in- tense application to study." "Your people are highly favored in their pastor," Mr. Fisher said. "He is much respected wherever he is known. As a preacher, he is seldom surpassed. There is no clergyman who preaches for me that is more thought of than Mr. Eldridge. The whole people love to hear him preach; and there is, I am told, a greater attendance when I exchange with him than at any other time. So, if you do here maltreat him, you may expect to have the whole region to condemn you." "That would be no consideration at all," the squire re- marked. "What does a parish carefor the opinions of neigh- boring parishes when they are determined to carry a point?" Mrs. Davidson now entering the room, her husband at once said,- "My dear, Mr. Fisher has been giving me some new information respecting our pastor." "Ah I What is it, husband?" "Mr. Eldridge is a frequent contributor to that quar- terly from New York which we take and to other period- icals likewise." "That is new, indeed," Mrs. Davidson replied. "He wrote that article in the last number on decrees which I read to you and sister."   84     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONA Go. "Did he, indeed?" exclaimed Mrs. Davidson. "How much we admired it! We should not have been more in- terested had we known who the author of it was; should we?" "No, not any more, my dear; so they cannot say that we admire Mr. Eldridge's sermons because we like the man, and for no other reason ; can they? He writes the articles over the signature CALVIN, which I have so fre- quently spoken of as being uncommonly excellent." "Was he the author of those articles? Indeed I How much you have said in their praise!"Mrs. Davidson ob- served. "Mr. Fisher tells me, likewise, that our  pastor is thought by the clergy about here to be a great theolo- gian." "We think he is, husband ; and why should not others? You. know how deeply interested our people have been in the course of lectures which Mr. Eldridge has been de- livering." "Course of lectures!" said Mr. Fisher, with surprise. "May I ask on what subjects, madam?" "He began, about a year since," Mrs. Davidson replied, "to deliver a course of sermons on the beingo of God, the inspiration of the Scriptures, and on the doctrines and duties made known in the Bible. The last which he de- livered was on the necessity of regeneration. He delivers one on each Sabbath morning." "I never heard of this before," Mr. Fisher observed. "Mr. Eldridge must need much time for the preparation of these discourses." "They could not be hastily prepared," Mrs. Davidson replied, "as is evident to us all. Mr. Eldridge tells me that they cost him great labor and research. They are exceedingly well written, and as good as any sermons I ever read on such subjects. I have been more interested   THE PASTOR A THEOLOGIAN AND STUDENT.   85 in hearing him than I ever was in reading -Dr. Dwight on the same subjects." "My dear, Mr. Eldridge is a young man, and has not yet been settled in the ministry five years. How can you think him superior to Dr. Dwight?" the squire inquired. "I know he is a young man," Mrs. Davidson replied; "but he is a great man, too." "He must be a very hard student to accomplish what he does," Mr. Fisher said. "He is such," Mrs. Davidson replied. "Mrs. Eldridge tells me that he is not in bed on an average-more than six hours; that he studies all the morning, and will not be interrupted but by some most pressing call; that, when lie visits, it is in the afternoon, and that not more than three afternoons of each week are thus devoted ; and that he spends all his evenings in his study when not at the lecture, or prayer meeting, or a wedding. There can be no doubt, therefore, that he is very frugal of his time." "Do the people like to have their pastor so much con- fined to his study?"Mr. Fisher inquired. "Do they not wish him to visit more than he can in three afternoons of the week? 7 "There is occasionally a remark made on the subject," Mrs. Davidson said, "by some who would be better pleased with a little more pastoral visiting. But the people know where their minister is when he is not among them, and are generally willing that he should be in his study if he pre- fers ; for they feel that they shall be more profited on the Sabbath if he is mostly in his study during the week. Some of us, however, are fearful that he will break down because he is so studious." "There is not much danger of that whilst he continues in his present habits," the squire said. "He is very 8   86     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. abstemious and very regular in his exercise. I rather think he understands how to take care of his health." "I hope he does," Mrs. Davidson remarked. "He is such a useful minister that it would be lamentable indeed if he should lose his health." "I do not perceive any indications of declining health," said Mr. Fisher, " as I meet him from time to time. He endures well, I think." "His health is very good at present," said the squire; "and I hope his present journey will contribute to its con-, tinuance. W hilst he is so highly esteemed abroad among his brethren for his correct theology and varied accom- plishments, I want he- should continue to pour his light around on them all, some of whom I fear are in darkness." "Very true," said Mr. Fisher, " very true. Some of us are in the fog if not in greater darkness. All the light you can spare we will receive and employ to the best possible advantage. See to it, if you please, that you do not break the lamp from which so much light ra- diates, or so conduct that it will be wrested from its place." "Thank you, sir, for the caution," the squire remarked, "always a timely one; and I would that all the people might heed it." After tea, as Mr. Fisher was leaving for his own parish, which was distant only four miles, he remarked that he should go away with very pleasing impressions in regard to the prospects of his friend their pastor. His people manifesting for him the warmest affection and highest respect, and he anxiously and studiously devoted to their best spiritual good, made his situation most useful and happy. "It may be," said the squire, " that occasion might ren- der it expedient and useful for me to divulge what you have said in regard to Mr. Eldridge. If there be this   THE PASTOR A THEOLOGIAN AND STUDENT.   87 occasion, may I say from you that our pastor is regarded, in the association and by others without, as a very sound and safe theologian?" (; You may say all that," Mr. Fisher replied, " and add that he is rising rapidly in favor with the great and good, and that, if he is not well cared for here, some other peo- ple will be for attempting to improve his condition by securing for their own advantage his valuable services.   CHAPTER VII. THE PASTOR A PROMOTER OF BENEVOLENT EFFORTS. THE various enterprises of the times which shadow forth that day of glory when the dark and direful effects of the fall shall pass away, leaving in their place the transcendently beautiful hues of righteousness, had from Mr. Eldridge the warmest sympathy and the most energetic aid. None of them escaped his eye nor were without an impulse from his aid; for in them all he saw signs of triumphto that cause to which he had consecrated his life. On a Monday morning following the Sabbath on which he had commended one of these enterprises to his people in an earnest and truthful presentation of its worth, not only to the church, but to society in general, Colonel Pres- bury, Deacon Barnes, and one or two other gentlemen happened into the store of Squire Davidson about the same time. The conversation for a while was upon the great embarrassments of financial affairs in the country at that time prevailing, and which was almost every where the frequent topic of remark. At length, in apology per- haps for the exercise of more than ordinary prudence in the use of that which "answereth all things," Colonel Presbury observed,- "i Our ministerf-Deacon Barnes, seems to think that we are not suffering much from the scarcity of money; he b,/' .            (88)   THE PASTOR A PROMOTER OF BENEVOLENCE.   89 appears to feel that we have enough yet and to spare. f He was down upon us yesterday pretty hard, I thought." "None too hard," said the deacon. "Mr. Eldridge did grandly yesterday. Though he was very earnest; yet he did not oblige any to give who were not disposed. He left the matter about right." "Of course he did not oblige any to give ; for he could not do that," the colonel replied. "But, then, a man can- not avoid doing something, after his duty is made so plain, and the cause so important and imperative. Besides, one feels rather small in refusing to sign something when his neighbors are giving pretty liberally." "I am pleased to hear you admit," said the deacon, "that our minister exhibits the duty of benevolence with clearness and force, and makes the particular cause he ad- vocates tell its own claims to patronage." "Yes, deacon, I suppose I must admit that; if I did not, should be in a rather small company. I think Mr. Eldridge does pretty well when he undertakes with the pocket. Somehow or other he makes the money come. But what is the use of his taking up so many of these causes, deacon? He has one a month, and sometimes two." "He considers them all very important, I suppose; as, indeed, they are. They all seem to be necessary for the benefit of our fellow-creatures and for bringing forward the day when religion shall generally prevail and all wickedness and oppression shall cease." "Well, deacon," said the colonel, "neither you nor I will live to see that day." "But we may hasten its approach, colonel, if we are pretty liberal and perform our other duties connected with this great event." "It costs too much, deacon, it really costs too much for me," said the colonel, with an expression of countenance that made it evident he was sincere in -the utterance. 8    90     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "Last year, what I gave and what my wife and daughters gave, after the appeals of Mr. Eldridge from month to month, amounted to one hundred and twenty-seven dollars." "I am really glad he was' so successful," the deacon re- plied with a smile. "If he had obtained twice that amount it would have been no matter. Your purse is deep, you know." "Really, colonel," said the squire, "you did well last year. I presume you lost no sleep by your liberality." "No; but then I lost some money. I shall have to stop giving if Mr. Eldridge continues to call as often as he has done. He'll drain me all dry." "You need not flatter yourself," said the squire, "that the calls upon you will be any the less frequent or urgent by reason of any backwardness on the part of our pastor in soliciting." "I suppose not," the colonel mournfully said; "I sup- pose not. Mr. Eldridge thinks he is right, and there!s no stopping him; he will go ahead." "I think our people have done very well for a few years past in their contributions to benevolent objects," the squire remarked. "They were not much disposed to give when Mr. El- dridge first came here," Mr. Parker said. "They were not, that is true," the squire replied. "They had not been trained to benevolent habits. We are indebted to Mr. Eldridge for this process." "Yes, yes, we are," quickly responded Colonel Pres- bury. "Mr. Eldridge has not been slow in this department of labor. We have had line upon line and precept upon precept, here a little and there a good deal, by way of in- struction and appeal. If it had not been for Mr. El- dridge I should have been a thousand dollars richer- yes, a thousand dollars richer! I was reckoning recently what our family have given that I know of to different   THE PASTOR A PROMOTER OF BENEVOLENCE.   91 benevolent societies for the last four years ; and principal and interest make the amount a little rising one thousand dollars." "Perhaps," said Deacon Barnes, "you would not have been so rich as you now are by several thousand dollars had not our pastor been instrumental in opening your heart and purse somewhat. I believe public opinion de- clares that you have added more to your property for the last three years than at any former period." "I have not lost quite so much lately by bad debts as I formerly did," the colonel replied. "As for making money, you know any one can do that." "If every one can make money," the deacon replied, "there are very few who succeed as you have done. You have been wonderfully prospered. I hope you will give over two thousand dollars to benevolent societies for- the next four years; and I advise you to resolve to do this, or more, if you wish to continue to grow rich. I believe in Scripture promises and Scripture threatenings, colonel.' I believe in this one, for instance : 'There is that scattereth and yet increaseth; and there is the withholding more than is meet, and it tendeth to poverty.'  "Well, well," said the colonel, "I shall do in the way you mention for the next four years, if I should live, just as little as I can." "O, colonel," the deacon replied, "how can you be thus ungrateful after having been blessed in the period when you have been somewhat liberal more than -in any such length of time before? ' "I was not expecting such a decision from you, colonel," said the squire, "to give as little as you could." "If I continue to go to meeting," the colonel replied, "and if we have Mr. Eldridge for our minister, I do not be- lieve that it will be possible for me to give less than- two thousand dollars for the next four years. I tell you what,   92     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. gentlemen, Mr. Eldridge has a wonderful faculty for get- ting away money." "If this be your feeling," said the deacon, "I am glad of it. I hope and believe Mr. Eldridge will remain with us. If you do as you think you are likely to do, you may advance very much in property whilst you remain benevo. lent." "Now that our pastor has gotten us in such a good way of giving, as you call it, I think," said the colonel, " it would be well for him to go to some of the neighboring parishes and stir them a little. Some of them might be benefited, perhaps, by his services. I should like to have him try some of them; and if he bled them pretty smartly I would not object. It would be a capital plan for the American Board or some other benevolent society to em- ploy him. He would raise the moneyfor them." "The attempt has been made by one benevolent society," said the squire, "to secure his services." "It has!" said the colonel. "He has been invited to leave us, then? How much salary has he been offered?" "Much more than he has here," was the reply. "How lately was this offer made him?" the colonel in- quired. "About two months since," the squire said. "He is not intending to leave us," the colonel remarked, "or he would have asked for a dismission before this, I suppose."- "I think Mr. Eldridge will not leave us at present," the squire said. "What a noble agent Mr. Eldridge would make I "Mr. Parker observed. "His heart is so deeply interested in all the benevolent societies that he would be very likely to infuse his own interest into any audience he might ad- dress.." "If he should succeed in all congregations as he has in   THE PASTOR A PROMOTER OF BENEVOLENCE.   93 our own," said the deacon, "he would truly accomplish great things for any society which might have the good fortune to secure his services." "It is sometimes really amusing," the squire observed, "'to hear what is said of Mr. Eldridge's manner of reach- ing the heart. You know Mr. Andrews don't believe in these benevolent societies. A few Sabbaths since it was announced that on the next Sabbath a subscription wouldl be taken up in dbehalf of the sailors. In the course of the week Henry Andrews- a roguish fellow, you know - im- portuned his father for five dollars, for the purpose of pur- chasing a gun. His father, being disinclined to give him the sum, remonstrated with Henry. He told him that he had other and better uses for his money, and said a va- riety of things to dissuade the boy from pressing his re- quest.. Henry at last became impatient and said, 'You will give next Sunday, I dare say, to Mr. Eldridge's sail- ors twice as much as I ask you for now.' His father told him if he did, or if he gave any thing, he would certainly give him 'five dollars 4with which to buy the gun. Henry said no more, but was willing to wait. You remember how very earnest and interesting Mr. Eldridge was that Sabbath when he pleaded the cause of seamen, how elo quently he described their perilous condition and their in- dispensable agency in bringing to our shores the products of foreign climes and of taking to these regions our own surplus commodities, and withal how truthfully he painted the representative character of the sailor, and thence de- duced the importance that he be both qualified and dis- posed to give the true representation of the land of his birth. Well, after the subscription had been taken and the services were closed, I met Henry Andrews as I was passing out, and from his looks I perceived he wished to speak to me. I addressed him, and gave him opportunity. So he at once said that he would like to see the subscrip-   "     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGE. tion paper which had just been circulated. Taking the paper from my pocket, I handed it to him. I saw. ho looked confused after examining it a moment, and I asked him if I could assist him in any way. He said his object in looking at the paper was to ascertain if his father's name was on it. I informed him that it was, and at once showed it to him. 'Good--good,' said he; 'father is down for ten dollars.' His joy was so great that I could not resist the promptings of my curiosity, and I asked him what pleased him so much at discovering that his father had given ten dollars. He then told me the story of the gun, and appeared sure that he should now have it." "That is pretty good," said the colonel. "I knew Mr. Andrews gave ten dollars, for I heard him speak of it. He said that he did not intend to givea cent. When he went to meeting he determined that he would not patron- ize these societies-that he would keep his money for useful purposes; but he said Mr. Eldridge obtained the advantage of him.  He lost control of himself, and was forced to surrender his own judgment to the reasoning and conclusions of the minister; and he put down  ten dollars for the sailors." "You heard of the effect of that sermon on Mrs. Pitch- er; did you not, colonel?" "I have heard nothing," was the reply. "My   wife was telling me," said the squire, "that a sis- ter of Mrs. Pitcher, who resides in Boston, has been out on a visit lately, and that Mrs. Pitcher was very much taken up with -a silk dress worn by her sister, and was determined to have one of a  similar pattern. She sup- posed her husband would begrudge the money, and that fifteen dollars would come  hard from him for a single dress. However, she ventured to encounter his rebukes of her extravagance, and requested the requisite sum, at the same time saying that she knew of no reason why she "!-   THE PASTOR A PROMOTER OF BExNEVOLE NCE.  95 should not have a dress equal to that of her sister.  So, after the exercise of all her tact and eloqucnce, she suc4 ceeded in obtaining from.her husband the amount she desired. Her sister was expecting to .return home the next week, and Mrs. Pitcher was intending to send by her for the dress. The Sunday following Mr. Eldridge preached in behalf of seamen; and when the subscription paper was handed to Mr. Pitcher he did not look at it; !  but, being passed onward in the pew, his wife took it and put down ten dollars. After she returned home she ac- quainted her sister with the fact, and remarked that she did not know but that she should have to do without her silk dress; for she was so mbuch overcome by Mr. El- dridge's sermon she could not resist her convictions of duty, and subscribed ten dollars for the sailors." " That's good! " exclaimed the colonel. "I am really glad Mr. Pitcher got bled so; but I hope his wife did not lose her dress." ""No; she did not," Mr. Parker observed;  but her husband was mighty poor for some time afterwards. I had occasion, about that time; to borrow some money for a few days; and, as I had often been accommodated be- fore by Mr. Pitcher, I called upon him for the loan. He replied that he did not know as he had so much money as I wanted- that he was poor and did not know what he should'do. 'My family,' said he, 'are getting to be very extravagant. I have had to give Mrs. Pitcher lately thir- ty dollars to buy a dress; but ten of it, I hear, went to dress the sailors.' As he said this he looked not very kindly at his good wife; but she explained the matter and laughed very heartily all the while; and Icould not avoid joining her. Her husband at last was obliged to give in and laugh too." "Poor man !" said Deacon Barnes. "I suppose Mr. Pitcher is worth seventy-five thousand dollars."   96     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "Yes," said the colonel, " all of that; but he is poorer than most men who are not worth five hundred dollars. I am glad his wife gets some of his money; I wish she might obtain three hundred dollars where she now gets but thirty."   "People don't seem to think any the worse of Mr. EI- dridge for his efforts in raising money for objects of be. nevolence, do they, squire?"Mr. Parker inquired. "Not that I have heard," was the reply. "I believe they are pleased that he is so successful." "He does some good at home, I confess," said the colo- nel, "when he labors for money to be sent abroad. He opens some hearts that never. showed any doors before. Some people are the better, I have found, for giving ; they are more like human beings than formerly,; they have more feeling; they show a better spirit." "That is one of the effects of benevolence," the squire rejoined. "I have often heard Mr. Eldridge remark that he valued the benefits which accrued to his own people from their giving about as much as those produced abroad by their benefactions. The reflex influence of benevolence he thinks very great and powerful." "That is a new idea to me," said Mr. Bolles, who had entered the store after this conversation began; "but there may be some foundation for it, I confess. So Mr. Eldridge is thinking of home when he is laboring for ob- jects abroad?" "Certainly, my good sir," said the squire; " he thinks of his people first and last; and in all that he undertakes he has an eye to their good." "b Well, then, no one can blame him for being so wide awake in his efforts for all the benevolent societies," Mr. Bolles continued, " when he sees that the influence of the liberality of his people is to benefit them." "I do not see how Mr. Eldridge can be censured," said   THE PASTOR A PROMOTER OF BENEVOLENCE.   97 the squire. "For my part, I value him the more for his energy and perseverance in advocating the different be- nevolent societies. i If Mr. Eldridge imitated the example of some ministers ani was silent in relation to the calls of these societies through fear that his activity would con- flict with the attachment of his people to their money, he would not accomplish half for our good that he now does, nor be half so much worthy of our love nd respect." 9   CHAPTER    'VIII. THE PASTOR'S ACKNOWLEDGED CARE OF THE YOUNG. --IN- TEREST IN THE AGED AND THE IGNOBLE. THE wealthy and learned in the community are not the only individuals of influence; there are other classes who at times wield a tremendous power. There are those who are set aside by the popular voice as incapable of much effect, who nevertheless exert an influence by which the greatest ends are sometimes achieved. It often becomes important to collect the scattered fragments of influence; and for this purpose the partisans enthusiastically engaged in achieving a triumph for their cause with the greatest energy and perseverance explore every nook and corner of society to discover any thing to aid them, and with joy and exultation hail any power, however feeble or obscure, which promises the least assistance in accomplishing their object. This last source of power, though usually ac- counted by the multitude as of little moment, is yet often great and decisive, both in the arena of political and civil strife and in ecclesiastical concerns. As a party in either sphere may have such power in its favor, so its vote is triumphant and its cause victorious. The little children of a  religious community, who are never consulted when their parents are canvassing the qualifications of the dif- ferent candidates in nomination for political promotion, and the aged men and women, who are contemplated as in (98)   THE PASTORS CARE OF THE YOUNG, ETC.   99 waiting for an introduction to another sphere of existence, having long since been made of no practical account in the one where they are now numbered, and the poor and ignoble, who are regarded more like an incubus than a blessing to society, are made to come forth at times in a parish and exert a power that controls the destiny of its pastor. Hence it is always considered a fortunate posi- tion for a pastor when he has the interest of the children enlisted in his favor - when he has the expressions of love and attachment from the poor and the ignoble. Hence, too, a minority opposed -to a minister account it much to their advantage when able truthfully to report that he is lightly esteemed by the children and an object of dislike by the poor and the lower classes of society. Whatever was the motive of Mr. Eldridge, or whether he was prompted by any specific policy in his movements, one thing was very apparent; and that was, that he had the blessings of the aged abundantly upon him, the warm- est affection of the poor bursting forth from hut and hovel at his-side, as well as all the interest which sparkling eyes and prattling tongues of children could convey whenever the pastor was in their circle or his name mentioned in their presence. "What are those boys and girls trying to do?" said Mr. Lovell, from New York city, who was the guest of Squire Davidson, when walking with him about the village. "  What boys and girls?" inquired the squire, looking about in search bf them. "Over there by the tavern, a little this side; there are thirty or forty of them," Mr. Lovell replied. "O, yes ; I see them now," the squire remarked, looking that way. "Let us stop a while and see what they are up to." Soon Mr. Eldridge was seen coming from the post office.   100    A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. As he advanced towards the children there was great commotion-laughing, shouting, and a variety of move- ments whichldenoted that great pleasure was in anticipa- tion or in enjoyment. When Mr. Eldridge had approached very near where they were the children opened on the right and left, the boys with their hats and caps off, and the girls courtesying, and all most respectfully .greeting the minister they loved. Having passed through the line, Mr. Eldridge turned round and stood as if speaking to his young friends. Then they gathered around him, and he took them severally by the hand, exchanging congratula- tions with them. The squire and his friend were the while approaching and much enjoying the scene. "The little folks seem highly pleased with their minis- ter," Mr. Lovell remarked, addressing Mr. Eldridge. "They usually anticipate seeing me here about this time of the day as I go to the post office," Mr. Eldridge replied. "Their school has just closed, and they want some diversion." "They do not appear to be afraid of you," said Mr. Lovell. "I hope not," Mr. Eldridge replied. "I should regret very much to have any boys and girls in the parish in the slightest fear of me. I ever encourage all to approach me with the same familiarity that they do their parents." "I have often noticed," said the squire, " the same kind of regard for you before; and when my attention was called to the children by my friend as we were walking by the graveyard, I stopped to allow him to witness their doings." "It is a very pleasing spectacle, truly," said Mr. Lovell, "and auspicious of good, when children manifest such deep interest in their pastor; for children are a mirror in which their parents can be seen."     \ With a grateful and gracious bow Mr. Eldridge bade   THE PASTOR'S CARE OF THE YOUNG, ETC.   101 adieu to these gentlemen, being desirous of speking with another individual who was passing in a carriage. Re- suming their walk, Mr. Lovell remarked, "Mr. Eldridge must have a very strong hold of the young people of his parish, I should judge." " ie has an uncommon share of their interest and affec- tion," the squire replied. "I do not remember ever to have known a pastor so generally beloved by the younger portion of his flock as is the case here. As much interest would be expressed in as many children in other parts of the parish as was manifested here just now." "It is a fine thing that it is so," Mr. Lovell remarked:. "If the children have affection for a pastor they will be pleased in hearing him preach, and will be inclined to treasure up his instructions in their hearts." "We have found this to be case," the squire replied. "We often hear that children in the parish consider it a very heavy trial when it is necessary for them to be absent froum church on the Sabbath. They are so much interested in Mr. Eldridge as to be unwilling to be deprived of the pleasure of hearing him preach even for a single Sabbath. That they remember what he preaches we know, from the fact that in the Sabbath school they give us a very ac- curate account of the sermon. It is truly astonishing to hear some of them repeat what they have heard. They will give the text, chapter and verse, the subject and divisions, of the discourse; and frequently, in answer to the questions of the teachers, will bring out quite a re- spectable portion -of the sermon. I often think that I could not have given so intelligent an account of the preaching as I frequently hear from some of the children." "They are not excited to treasure up so much of the dis- course by any expectation that Mr. Eldridge will know of it, are they?"Mr,. Lovell asked. "I presume that consideration has influence upon them,' 9*   102     A VOICE FROM TtIE PARSONAGE. the squire replied; " for it is often that the pastor visits the school and is present when the children are giving their account of his discourse." "It must be a great source of pleasure as well as hope to him to know that he has such retentive hearers in the younger part of his audience," said Mr. Lovell. "Undoubtedly it is," said the squire, "and very grati- fying to the children likewise to have Mr. Eldridge aware how well they remember his sermons. I have often heard that some of the children have been much pained at not giving so full an account of the sermon in the Sabbath school as they had previously given to their parents, be- cause they supposed their failure was noticed by the pastor." At the dinner table, around which the squire and his friend were summoned, as they entered the house on the conclusion of their walk, Mr. Lovell, addressing Mrs. Da- vidson, remarked,- "I have been highly delighted this morning with the discovery of excessive interest on the part of your young people here in their pastor." "Indeed!" said the good lady. "And what may it be?" The gentleman then proceeded and narrated what has just now been under the eye of the reader, when Mrs. Da- vidson observed,-- "That was an interesting spectacle, was it not, Mr. Lovell? It is always pleasant to notice in children re- spect and affection for their minister. Mr. Eldridge has many such demonstrations of regard by his little parish- ioners." "He has a wonderful faculty of interesting the young," Frances remarked. "They all think much of him. In a neighborhood about three miles from here, where there are quite a number of children, last spring the girls were in the habit of meeting every Saturday afternoon in the   THE PASTOR'S CARE OF THE YOUNG, ETC. "10 school house for the purpose of preparing some testimonial of respect for the pastor. They met in this way for two months, we heard, and made a large and splendid bed- spread. When it was ready to be put together and quilted their mothers and older sisters were invited to Mrs. Kim- ball's, where they had a fine quilting party. An invitation was given to Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge to favor a few of their friends with their company in the evening. The work was all completed before dark and ready for a for- mal presentation. Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge in the evening joined this happy company, and were somewhat surprised at noticing that pretty much all the people in the neigh- borhood were present, and that, instead of seeing a few, they had the pleasure of welcoming many of their friends. They had not been at Mr. Kimball's an hour before it be- came evident to them that some other reason than the enjoyment of a mere social visit had gathered their friends together. There was the arranging of chairs around the room in a peculiar order, and the company taking their seats upon them, with an expression of countenance every now and then upon some of them that unmistakably told Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge there was a secret about to be revealed. Then a large table was rolled into the centre of the room, and soon two young ladies entered, bearing a long roll, tastefully folded and tied with ribbons. Then Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge were asked to occupy two chairs near this table and roll; and opposite them three young girls seated themselves. Whilst all this was going on conversation was generally suspended. On the part of the pastor and his wife there was the silence of suspense; but on the part of the others there was the impatience for the crowning scene of the evening. All the preliminaries being arranged, one of the young ladies, who sat opposite the pastor and his wife, arose, and in a neat and appropriate manner made known the real cause of the present gathering.   104     A VOICE FR'OM THi PAfEtOSAdft. In doing this many very complimentary things were said of the pastor and his companion. To prove that the heart was in these expressions of respect and affection, and not the tongue only concerned in them, she observed that her young associates and friends who were present had for. weeks been engaged in fashioning a memorial of their feelings, and which it was now her happy fortune, in their name, to present to her pastor and wife. Instantly the other girls by the side of the speaker unrolled the fabric that had lain on the table, and it appeared most beautiful indeed. Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge were taken by surprise, being wholly unaware that any such expression of friendship was intended, and both were much affected." "That must have been a most interesting occasion to them, I confess," Mr. Lovell remarked. "I suppose the article presented cost the young ladies much labor and anxiety." "O yes," said Frances, " and not a little money too. It was certainly a magnificent piece of work for the kind. It was compo'sed mostly of silk and satin, and very richly embroidered. It was thought thiat it would sell readily at auction for thirty or forty dollars." "As Frances has given you information of the gener- osity of the girls," the squire observed, "I will tell you what the boys did last winter.' "I should be happy to hear,'"Mr. Lovell said. "Last winter," the squire continued, "we had a large quantity of snow in this region, and some of the older boys started the project of making the minister a present of a load of wood. The plan was, that each boy should obtain from his father as much as he was disposed to give and deposit the same on a piece of ground near the school house. When all had made their contribution, a day was fixed upon to convey the wood in a single load to the parsonage. Accordingly, at the appointed time, the boys   THE PASTOR!S ,CARE OP THE YOUNG, ETC.  105 met at the school house to load up. They first loaded one sled and drove it along a little way. Then they loaded another :and drove that ,along to the first leoad, and at- tached it firmly to the same by chains. In this way they proceeded till the whole lot of wood was all loaded up. They then put on their team, which consisted of seven yoke of oxen, and drove down to the minister's in high spirits. This team, and those interested in its manage" ment, attracted great attention along the road; and when it reached its destination there were more than a hundred men and boys around, who had fallen in along the route. Mr. Eldridge, hearing quite a tumult about his premises, was somewhat alarmed, on opening the door, to ;see such a collection :of people. Somehow or other the wood es- caped. his notice ; and he was not aware that it stood by till he was ,asked by a little fellow, who, for his brightness and intelligence, had won the name of John Quincy Adams, if he would accept of a small load of wood." "He made no objections, I suppose," said Mr. Lovell. "Of course not," the squire proceeded ; " but he was eX- ceedingly overcome, I assure you. In common with others, as the load passed my store, T followed on. After the wood was unloaded, little John Quincy Adams, in behalf of the donors, addressed Mr. Eldridge in a short speech, which was touching in the extreme. It must have :made Mr. Eldridge feel that he was beloved by all the young people of the parish. In concluding his remarks, John Quincy said that, if agreeable to Mr. Eldridge, the boys would meet on the next Saturday and saw, split, ,and pile up the wood." "That was a very hanusome thing," said Mr. Lovell. "How much wood did the load contain?" "It was thought there were over eight cords -of it," the squire replied. "That was a most valuable present, I .confe3s," said   106     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONXAGE. Mr. Lovell. "They met, I suppose, and sawed and piled the wood as proposed?" "That they did," the squire replied; "and there was a large company together at the time. The news had spread; and boys far and near were there with saws and axes, which were used most industriously till the whole work was done; and the whole lot of wood was sawed, split, and packed away in the the wood house before one o'clock." "The minister had a large company at dinner that day, I suppose," Mr. Lovell said. "He might have had, had not his intentions been frus- trated by some of the people in this neighborhood, who thought they would like a share in the doings of the day. They got up a dinner at the tavern for about two hundred persons; and all who were at Mr. Eldridge's, whether as workers or spectators, were invited there to dinner." "The dinner must have cost a large sum," said Mr. Lovell. "Tavern skeepers don't work for nothing, you know." "It must have cost something, of course," said the squire; "but the dinner was not provided by the landlord of the house. The families in the village here- furnished the tables, each contributing meats, puddings, pies, &c. The landlord, being a generous man and a lover of good times, offered the gratuitous use of his hall, tables, crockery, &c." "All this is worth knowing," Mr. Lovell remarked. "Was an account of the affair ever published? It ought to have been." "A long article in reference to it was written by one of our young men," the squire replied, " and would have been published had not Mr. Eldridge interfered to pre- vent it. He said he did not like to have a great noise made about himself in the community. He acknowledged, however, the kindness in a brief card in the papers, but   ftE PASTOR'S CABt 01r Tft YOUNGt , ErTC. 10 not in a manner to bring out all the facts as I have now stated them." "I should think," said Mr. Lovell, "Mr. Eldridge must feel that he has one of the very best of parishes." "There is human nature here, after all," the squire somewhat dryly replied. "We are by no means perfect." "We have a pastor, Mr. Lovell, who understands very well how to get along with all classes of his parishioners," aunt Sarah said. "He is attentive to every one,'and all seem to think he is their peculiar friend. You would be much interested in hearing some of our poor people speak of him and to know of many expressions of their attach- ment." "That is another star in your pastor's crown, I suppose," Mr. Lovell replied. "It is much in his favor," aunt Sarah said. "Some ministers seem to think it is not of much consequence whether they pay -any particular attentions to the poorer classes or not. They appear to feel that, if they can keep on the right side of the more influential members of their parish, they will have no cause for trouble. I don't know as this is their feeling, but it looks like it." "O sister, you must not judge ministers so harshy," interposed the squire. "They -are not all constituted alike, you know." "Ah, well," aunt Sarah continued, "I think a minister ought to be conversant with all his people; he ought to know them all, and especially those in the lower walks of life. They are greatly comforted by being noticed by the minister, and 'greatly benefited likewise. Only think how much pleasure widow Tompkins takes in telling of the attentions she receives from Mr. Eldridge." "This is all true," said the squire. "I acknowledge it all. It is very important that a minister does not over- look the poor and the ignoble; but you know that some   108     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGE. clergymen are of such a temperament as leads them to neglect particular attentions to any. Some neglect the ' rich .as much as they do the poor; and they are good min- isters, too, for all this." "I wish all who neglect the poor would come here and take lessons of our minister," aunt Sarah rejoined. "Let them go with him to Mrs. Snowden's, and widow Tomp- kins's, and some others whom I could mention; and, if I mistake not, they would be induced to search out for simi- lar persons in their own parishes, and be comforted and encouraged in their labors by their conversation and ex- perience." "I should judge from this remark, Miss Davidson, that these cases to which you allude were interesting ones," Mr. Lovell observed. "Will you enlarge a little?" "I must refer you to Frances," aunt Sarah replied, " as she often accompanies Mr. Eldridge to widow Tompkins's, and some other individuals like her." "As Mr. Eldridge often has our carriage," Frances pro- ceeded, "he frequently invites me to ride with him; and I always feel it ,a privilege to accept his invitation. I have been with him several times to Mrs. Tompkins's, who resides some four miles from here, and has been confined to her room for several years with the dropsy. She is very poor, and has but one child at home. Last week I was there without Mr. Eldridge, having begged the privilege of accompanying father, who was going by her house, that I  might remain with her till his return. I had scarcely been seated before she expressed her great regret that Mr. Eldridge had not come with me. 'You don't know how much I enjoy his visits,' she said. 'His conversation makes me think of his great Master, who sought opportu- nities to do good to the poor, the sick, and the afflicted. tHe seems to be very different from other ministers I have known; he cares for all, whether rich or poor, high or   THE PASTOR'S CARE OP TtE YOUNG, ETC.  109 low. Sometimes when he has been here I have thought he cared for the poor more than he did for the rich, and I have heard a number of poor people say it seemed just so to them. Re comes to see me about once a mouth, and I: have a feast when he is here that lasts me a great while, He makes me forget my pains and trials, and carries me away to heaven, so that I long to be there. You can't think,' she said, 'how different he is from our former pas- tor. He used to come once or twice a year, but did not seem to enter into my case. I did not get much sympathy or much good either from him. He always seemed to come because he thought he must, and not because he wanted to. Now, Mr. Eldridge appears to have pleasure in calling, because he feels that he is doing good. 0O she continued, 4' am under the greatest obligations to him, blessed man 1 He has taught me a great deal about Christ and heaven.' She went on in this way for some time, giving expression to her exceeding interest in our pastor. I could not help thinking whilst she was speaking that all she said 'was true; for certainly when I have been with Mr. Eldridge he appeared just as she described." "How long has she been sick?"Mr. Lovell inquired. "About twenty years," Mrs. Davidson replied. "She ought to have sympathy from some quarter, I think," Mr. Lovell said. "She certainly ought," said Mrs. Davidson; " but, poor woman I she does not receive much. She lives on a road that is not much travelled, and there are not many who are sufficiently interested in the poor to go and see her. I am highlly gratified with Mr. Eldridge's attentions to her." "Mr. Eldridge treats all the poor and afflicted just after this manner," aunt Sarah remarked. "There is Mrs. Snowden, a pious woman I believe, but who, for some reason or other, has not been much cared for, who thinks 10   "O     A VOICE PROM THE PARSOXA(G, a great deal of Mr. Eldridge. She has a very bad cancer in her face, and looks so disagreeable that people don't like to go there. She is very poor, and cannot for this reason do as she would-keep herself and room looking neat. Mr. Eldridge goes there once a week, I believe; and people tell me that she is very much comforted by his visits. Brother says, when he calls there to make her a present of things she needs for her comfort that she is almost all the time talking about our good minister. 'He can't think himself a bit better than I am,' she often says." "Mr. Eldridge must be a most excellent man," said Mr. Lovell. "I always like to hear that a minister is praised by the poor and those in the humbler walk of life." l"This class here all speak well of Mr. Eldridge," Fran- ces remarked. "I never heard a word of complaint from any of them that he was proud or indifferent to them,"   CHAPTER    IX. THE PASTOR A REVIVAL PREACHER. ON a pleasant day in February, as Squire Davidson was standing at the window after dinner, he noticed a sleigh approaching the house from the road below, and ex- claimed, - "I wonder who is coming here? O, I see now; it is Mr. and Mrs. Jaquith, from Linebrook parish." "Are they here, husband?" said his wife. "I am very glad of it. They have come over, I dare say, to attend some of our meetings." Soon Mr. and Mrs. Jaquith were seated around the cheerful fire, apparently much pleased .that they were again with those from whose society they had derived so much happiness on repeated occasions heretofore. "We hear you are having precious times over here," said Mrs. Jaquith; " and I have been telling husband for a week or two past that we must ride over and attend some of your meetings. I hope you are to have a meeting this evening." "We are," Mrs. Davidson replied ; "and this afternoon likewise."  "It seems you have heard of our revival," the squire ob- served. "We have heard very much about it," Mrs. Jaquith re- plied. "Mr. Mandel, you know, is over here from our (111)   "2     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. place two or three times a week; and if any individual would be likely to know of a revival, he is the one. He is very much interested in calling upon us from time to time to give us particulars of the work. He says he must always call when he is passing and tell us the glori- ous news."                   I "It is a glorious season, I assure you, that we are now enjoying," Mrs. Davidson remarked. "I never before knew such a revival as this." "You are highly favored here, I think," Mrs. Jaquith said, " in having such frequent revivals. This is the fourth, I believe, since Mr. Eldridge was settled." "I believe we have had three seasons of interest before the present," Mrs. Davidson said; " but neither of the oth- ers approached this in power and extent." "It is a great blessing to be favored with such a revival preacher as Mr. Eldridge," Mrs. Jaquith observed. "I often tell our :people that if we had such a preacher we should have revivals." "Is not your minister, Mrs. Jaquith, a good preacher?" the squire asked, in an earnest, if not in a reproving, manner. "We call Mr. Sibley a most excellent .man, and preacher too, over here." "Certainly," Mrs. Jaquith replied; "Mr, Sibley is a good preacher, and a very consistent and conscientious man ; but then he is no revival preacher." "My husband," Mrs. Davidson interposed, " is not par- tial to comparisons of ministers, being a great friend to them all. You will therefore, Mrs. Jaquith, excuse his earnestness, and place it to the account of his long ac- quaintance with you. We think as you do, that our minis- ter is ,a revival preacher." "I would not have you think, squire, that I undervalue Mr. Sibley," Mrs. Jaquith observed, with a good-natured smile. "Perhaps I did not express myself with as much propriety as I might have done."   THE PASTOR A REViVAL PREACHER.    113 "Such modes of speaking are very common, mnadam, and indicate a feeling with which I confess I have not much sympathy," the squire replied. "I have long been of the opinion that both ministers and churches were much injured by such comparisons as you have just made between your minister and Mr. Eldridge. Churches are injured because they serve as a palliation for their neglect of duty, and ministers are often injured by these comparisons be- cause their tendency is to prejudice minds against the one who appearsito the least advantage in the comparison. If a stranger to both ministers were here, he would un- doubtedly have had an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Sibley from your remark. All ministers are not alike, and it is for important purposes that there is a diversity of gifts. I think there may be as fair a prospect of a revival under the preaching of Mr. Sibley as under that of Mr. Eldridge, if the people do their duty faithfully." "O, then, you think the people in Linebrook are not as good and faithful Christians as your own people?"Mrs. Jaquith said, with a little excitement. "Not exactly that, tny good friend," the squire replied. "I have had the impression that your people attached a greater load to their minister than he could carry-that they expected more of him than is reasonable. It will not answer for the members of a church to feel that they have no responsibility il relation to the progress of reli- gion-that they may attend to their own concerns and yet the work)of the Lord be carried prosperously along by the minister. I have thought that your church had the feeling that it all depended on Mr. Sibley whether reli- gion prospered among you, and that his success was in no way connected with their prayers, sympathy, and general cooperation. I may be deceived, however; I hope that I am. Now, with us, we think Mr. Eldridge is a man iu need of helps encouragement, and of our persevering prayers; 10    "4     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. and that he will be prospered or hindered in his work in pro- portion to our own fidelity in these several respects. Now, I think, if your people would rally around their minister, and manifest an interest in him and in his labors, and would pray much for himl and his success, you might have revivals as frequently as we do here." "There is some truth in your remarks, I confess," Mrs. Jaquith said. "We are in the habit of thinking that it depends upon the minister; and, in helping or encour- aging him much, I think we are very deficient. You know our people are very industrious and think they have no time for other matters but those which relate immedi- ately to their own business." "There, that is it," the squire said ; ' but your people wish to be like other people; they want as successful a minister as any parish enjoys, and yet are indisposed to make the necessary sacrifices. Now, they must alter radi- cally, or no minister will be successful among them." "Well, squire, I wish you would go over there and tell us our duty and endeavor to infuse into our people the right spirit. They think much of you ; and I do -not know of an individual who would have more influence over' them." "I am obliged to you for the compliment," the squire replied. "If I could be of any benefit to your people, it would give me much pleasure to be with you at some of your meetings." "O, you could be of great benefit, I have no doubt," Mrs. Jaquith remarked. "What evening do you have a prayer meeting?" the squire asked.  "We have no particular evening," Mrs. Jaquith replied. "Formerly it was Wednesday evening; but of late we have not had prayer meetings often. Mr. Sibley became  discouraged. The members of the church did not have  ,9 r   THE PASTOR A REVIVAL PREACHER.    115 y interest in them. Sometimes there would be a deacon are, but not very often ; and at last it was very com- in for no other male member of the church to be present t the one at whose house the meeting was appointed. )wever, if you will go over, we could have a prayer eting appointed almost any evening." "I am really afraid it would not amount to much should ore be a meeting called merely to hear me talk a little ile," the squire said. "I do not see what ground there for expecting success to any religious efforts whilst the ople are so spiritually dead as their indifference to a ayer meeting fully demonstrates." At the appointed hour the squire and wife, with their ends, repaired to the vestry to attend a meeting for nference and prayer. The spacious room was crowded, d the adjoining rooms could hardly seat all who were esent. The deepest solemnity sat on every countenance, d strong anxiety was on many an awakened sinner. "What a meeting we have had!" said Mrs. Jaquith, as e was seated in the parlor of the squire. "How very lemn and interesting! How animated and eloquent Mr. dridge was O, I should think people would feel where is! He certainly understands how to get to the art." "He does," Mrs. Davidson replied; "there can be no istake about that. I do not know what he might do in place where the people were all spiritually dead; but he ,s certainly been instrumental of great good since he lS been here." "Don't you think he would wake up a dull and worldly lurch if he should be settled over such?"Mrs. Jaquith quired.  "I cannot tell," Mrs. Davidson replied. "There is kind that goeth not out only by prayer and fasting. aml may plant, Apollos water; but God must give the   "6     A VOICE FROM TE PARSOACt. ' increase. If there were not a praying church there coiId not be much ground for hope, I think 'Mr. Eldridge Would not remain long with a people who were indifferent ,to spirituaI progress, and neglectful of the .means for -ef. fecting it." "I cannot but think," Mrs. Jaquith said, "that your pastor would rouse up careless professors; his appeals could not fail to do this. They would have to feel, act, And; pray, I gait stre. Don't you think some ministers can do this work with more? success than others?" "Certainly," was the reply. "Well, that is what I think," said Mrs. Jaquith ; "and I meant only that this morning in: the remark that excited your husbaid a little, you remember." "'I taither thMnk, Sid Mrs. Davidsot, "that oitr minis- ter would not have much success among your people unless the Holy Spirit was, with him." "No, eertain y not,;"Mrs. Jaquith repli;ed; ;"'rt would he not be instrumental in stirring up the chureh so that they whuld' pray for the Holy Ghost?" ", I dto not knowow w that would be," Mrs. Davidson replied. ":You know it is hard for the Ethiopian to change hiMs skin or the' leopard his spots. From what I have heard, your deacons and leading men in the church are' excessively worlily.. They much prefer being where thev can advanee their temporal interest than1 at a prayer meeting. Unlesss they felt differently from what they now do, I do not believe Mr. Eldridge or any other minister would-do much good there." "It is very trying, I confest'"Mrs. Jaquith said, " to see such individuals as: you mention so bound up in this world. I know our people look up to them, and they are much censulred for their 'worldliness; but could not a minister rouse them -such a minister as Mr. Eldridge?" "Perhaps for a little time they might be more engaged   THE PASTOR A REVIVAL PREACHER.    1i7 outwardly if they had a new minister ; but it would not last long, I think," said Mrs. Davidson. "You know how greatly Mr. Richardson, your former pastor, was tried by the worldliness of your church. He was a rousing preacher, I am sure. He used to tell us he was discouraged because the deacons and other men of influence would not work with him, being so much engrossed with their plans for making money. He mentioned that he had labored hard with them to persuade to a different course, but that all his labor was lost. There is your Deacon Merill: Mr. Richardson used to say of him that he appeared much more interested in his own business than in the conversion of sinners or the prosperity of the church." "The deacon formerly felt very different from this. He was once a very engaged Christian." "Yes, I have heard that he was," Mrs. Davidson said. "Mr. Colton, who preached for you considerably in a revi- val you had fifteen or twenty years ago, told us that the deacon was then very much engaged and very active. But he has changed his opinion of late. He was here lately, and, in speaking of your parish and of Deacon Merill, remarked that he was astonished to notice his very great decline in piety." "He made the same remark at our house," Mrs. Jaquith said, "when he called there as he was on his way to vis' you. He said that until Deacon Merill was a changed man, as he had such influence, it would be impossible for Mr. Sibley or any other minister to do much good there. I thought he was rather severe on the deacon at the time; but I have since altered my mind." "Well, Mrs. Jaquith," said the squire, who had just come in with her husband, "how were you pleased with our meeting this afternoon?" "Very much pleased indeed," Mrs. Jaquith replied. "I do not remember that I ever was at a meeting which I   "8     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. enjoyed more. I thought all were very much engaged, and that your minister was particularly so. I should think there was great depth to the religious feeling here." "Yes, I think there is," the squire remarked, "and that the interest is daily becoming greater. I have just been conversing with Mr. Eldridge, who gives a very favorable account of the work." "I hope that I shall derive much benefit myself from being with you," Mrs. Jaquith said. "I already see things in a new light, both as respects myself and our people." "That is encouraging," said the squire. "I trust we shall all be profited by the interesting occasion we have enjoyed." "Mr. Eldridge is very well fitted to promote religious feeling, I think," said Mrs. Jaquith. "He is," said the squire. "He is a very good man, and rejoices in seeing the work of the Lord prospered. We have every reason to be satisfied with him. He does all that a man can do." "O, yes," said Mrs. Jaquith. "He looks very much ex- hausted. His labors must have been very great." "They have been excessively arduous," Mrs. Davidson replied.  "He is at work all the time, and we are fearful that he will overdo and be under the necessity of suspend- ing all effort." "That would be a great trial to you all as well as a hinderance to. the revival, would it not?"Mrs Jaquith inquired. "We should all very much feel the trial if Mr. Eld- ridge's health should fail and he be unable to continue his labors. The interest here might be checked, I think, by such an event."                   i "How   many conversions have there been among you since the commencement of the present revival?"Mrs. Jaquith inquired.   THE PASTOR A REVIVAL PREACHER.     119 "We do 'not know exactly," Mrs. Davidson replied. "We have heard that between sixty and seventy are ihdul- ging hope." "That is a large number," Mrs. Jaquith said:. "Should there be ho others, the accession of these to your chutrch would very much increase its strength. Your church now, I believe, is very large." "It is one of the largest in the region," Mrs. Davidson said. "It has increased very much since Mr. Eldridge has been with-us. Forty-seven a year is the average number which has been received by out present pastor." "' That is a large number," Mrs. Jaquith observed. " t cannot avoid feeling that your great prosperity is in a great measure to be ascribed to the engagedness of your pastor. He must be a revival preacher, or you could not have had such constant additions to your church." "We know that Mr. Eldridge is a revival preacher," the squire replied. "He is called such all over the parish, and has had this Character for years." "I inferred from what you said in the morning, squire," Mrs. Jaquith observed, " that you did hot allow that he was more of such a preacher than other ministers. I thought it was your opinion that he was mainly indebted to his church, under God, for his usefulness," "I do think so," the squire replied; " that is, I think, if our church did riot sympathize with Mr. Eldridge and co- operate with him, that he would not be as useful as he now is and as he has been'." "' Supposing any other minister to be your pastor, would his usefulness be as great as that of Mr. Eldridge, pro- vided your church were faithful in the discharge of duty?" "Some other minister might have equal success,"' the squire replied; "but not every minister would. I would not be understood as saying that it all depends upon the church whether a minister is or is not successful. I   120     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. ' acknowledge that much is depending upon the talents and devotedness of the minister. Some ministers would do well here who might not be equally successful elsewhere; and so some ministers might be instrumental of accom- plishing great good elsewhere who would fail here   . altogether." "Now, squire," Mrs. Jaquith asked, "do you not think i that some ministers are more revival preachers than others?" "I suppose I must say that I do," was the reply." "Mr. Eldridge is one of those preachers, you have said. You and I agree much better now than in the mornifng, I think," Mr. Jaquith said. "You have said that it is  difficult for one to- avoid feeling under Mr. Eldridge's preaching; and I said in the morning, that, if we had such a preacher as Mr. Eldridge, I thought he would make our church feel and do their duty." "He might make them feel, I acknowledge," the squire replied; " and yet, when they went out from his presence and mingled in the world, their own business would make them feel more. I do not doubt that Deacon Merill and others in your church often feel under Mr. Sibley's preach- ing." "O, I know they do," Mrs. Jaquith said. "Why, then, do you not have revivals?" the squire asked. "I do not know," was the reply; "but, then, I think we should if Mr. Eldridge was our- minister; he is different from Mr. Sibley." "It might be," the squire said," that Mr. Eldridge would be successful, with the blessing of God, in rousing your church, and thereby inducing them to be more consistent and active; but he would have a hard matter of it, I ap*- : prehend. Should he do this, you might have revivals.  . Until Christians do their duty, the ministry will not be  ,     .

I wish rour church and every church felt this, and then I think ve should hear less fault found with ministers because ,hey were unsuccessful, and more said in their praise be- ,ause of their instrumentality in leading many souls in the )ath to heaven." "   CHAPTER     X. VISIT OF A CONNECTICUT PASTOR. SQUIRE DAVIDSON being a native of Connecticut, as has already been stated, cherished that particular interest in the noble state which her character for all that is good ought ever to inspire in her children. After his removal from her territory he continued to cultivate that intimate acquaintance with whatever affected her prosperity which could be done by frequent visits and correspondence. By a large circle of warm friends there as well as in the state of his adoption he was regarded with the highest respect for the uniform consistency of his piety, and for his straight- forward, decided course in relation to every project which had for its end the good of his species and the glory or his Creator. Often has his house enclosed a happy com- pany who had journeyed thither from the vicinage of his native home to strengthen or renew the acquaintance that began in youth. Often, too, have many who never knew him but by report been incited by the fulness of this report of his worth: to attest the truth of what they had heard by a  visit to his hospitable abode. Many a   clergyman from Connecticut and other parts had been directed, for miles around his house, as they asked the way to Squire Davidson's ; and all these worthy men ever found themselves the welcome guests of a man whom they confided in as one of the strong pillars of the church. (122)   VISIT OF A CONNECTICUT PASTOR.    123 The good minister of his native town, who was ofteo among the crowd during election or anniversary week in Boston, was frequently heard by his wife to declare that he hardly knew which motive had the strongest power to' urge him on to Boston in the month of May - either that in the opportunity for seeing and hearing the great and the' good in the various convocations of the church, or that of a visit to the minister's firmest friend, in the person of Squire Davidson, near whose house his route lay to Boston. Probably, when meditating on the journey at the period now to be described, the good man was at no loss to( de- termine the strongest incentive to his course. The desire to enjoy the wise counsels and warm sympathy of the squire was predominant; for he' did not allow himself but one day in Boston, preferring to pass between three and four with the squire. Rev. Mr. Edmands, the clergyman above alluded to, had been settled in the native town of Squire Davidson eleven years. Though not the greatest theologian of the times nor the most eloquent preacher, yet his talents were very respectable, his acquirements equal to the average class of ministers, and his piety and devotedness to his Master's service were far beyond those of many of his brethren in the region. In the years of his pastorate he had been singularly successful among a people who had been riven by previous strife; and he had won over, by his humble, wise, and consistent course, many an individual who had avowed erroneous doctrines, and who had gone down to practices at a great remove from the way to heaven. The great truths of revelation which had been the subjects of ridicule ceased almost entirely to yield mirth; and the obloquy which had, in no contracted measure, been poured out on those who were attached to the visible kingdom of Christ, was so far wiped away as to allow the common remark, that there was something in religion of advantage   124     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. to man in the present life, and of. indispensable moment  to him in the life which follows. The church under his ministry had repaired its foundations, which former conten- tions and inconsistencies in its members had greatly shaken and enervated. It had been greatly strengthened, too, by additions of those who had formerly been the opposers of its doctrines and the scoffers in the community. The Sabbath congregation, instead of the meagre assembly within the house of God when Mr. Edmands began his ministry, had waxed so great as, to make it necessary to enlarge the sanctuary to give the worshippers room. Business had greatly prospered, and the general aspects of the place had undergone a most pleasing. revolution. Common acclamation ascribed all these important events, in a great measure, to the prudence and devotedness of the pastor. So many expressions had Mr. Edmands of the confidence and affection of his people as to induce within his breast the feeling that no other parish would ever be sought by him. The remark in neighboring towns was frequent among the people there 'residing, and who often interchanged feeling with Mr. Edmands's parish- ioners, that he was just the man for them, and that they were wonderfully attached to him. No intimation of dis- satisfaction reached his ears from year to year; and every thing favored the conclusion, till a few months before his present visit to the squire, that Mr. Edmands's parish would never think of another pastor till- his grave had been made in their own cemetery. In the annual visits of Squire Davidson to the home of his childhood and youth he had taken great pleasure in hearing from the people of their growing attachment to their pastor and of witnessing the beneficial results of his ministry. He, too, thought that it would never again be his grief to know of another change in the pastoral office there, unless it was effected by the death of the present   VISIT OF A CONNECTICUT PASTOR.    125 pastor. It was, therefore, no pleasing object to him that Mr. Edmands disclosed as the reason of his present visit that of seeking counsel in relation to the difficulties which had suddenly overtaken him. The squire, however, was not wholly taken by surprise; for a letter from his sister living in her native place, which he received a few weeks before, had apprised him that clouds now darkened her pastor's sky. As his friend broke to him the unpleasant intelligence he betrayed no previous knowledge of the case, being desirous to have Mr. Edmands unembarrassed in his statements of the causes and kinds of trouble which threatened the rupture of his pastoral relations. With these preliminary remarks the reader can enter with greater interest in the following conversation of the Connecticut pastor with his friend, after the two had been together but a brief period. "Is there any thing new in your parish?" the squire in- quired. "Some of the people are expecting something new, I believe," was the facetious reply. "What is that?" "A new minister," Mr. Edmands replied. "A new minister! a new ministerl What do you mean 9 " the squire with emotion asked. "I mean that I am thinking of asking for a dismission," Mr. Edmands replied. "I have thought such a thing impossible," the squire observed. "When I have been to your place from year to year I have been greatly gratified in witnessing in. creasing attachment to you from your people; and I have supposed, .after what has been brought about by your in- strumentality, as they all allowed, that you was fixed there for life. When I was there last fall I never heard more satisfaction expressed with their minister, and I comfort- ed myself with reflecting that the good old times were II*   126     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGE. returning to my native town when the people looked upon their pastor as settled with them for life." "I had no thought of leaving my people last fall when you were there," Mr. Edmands replied, "I was then as contented and satisfied as ever; but you know the tables with ministers nowadays suddenly turn." "I know it," said, the squire; "I know it to my bitter sorrow. The churches are in a sad condition. The pas- toral relation is too lightly esteemed, and almost any cause can sunder it; and frequently for no cause at all it is annulled. I often wonder. how any young man dare look towards the profession of a clergyman, when there is so much evidence at hand that it is often a life of servitude to thefacetiousness and cupidity of the people." "There must be ministers, you know," Mr. Edmands said, "and--" "Yes," said the squire, very quickly, thereby abridging the remark it was the intention of Mr. Edmands to make, "I know there must be ministers; but I am sometimes afraid there will not be many soon." "If poor human nature rules," said Mr. Edmands, "I think ministers may by and by be few. The precarious- ness of the tenure which now holds a minister to his people is so great, and the consequences to himself and family of its rupture are so disastrous often, as makes the office of a minister any thing but desirable, so far as the present world is concerned." "That is true," said the squire, " and my heart has often bled at the distress I have seen in the very best of minis- ters, who have been dismissed for no fault whatever of their own, but merely to gratify the pride or some other selfish interest of their people. It is for this reason, I fear, that young men may be deterred from entering the minis- try. But what is the reason of your thinking of asking for a dismission?"   VISIT OF A CONNECTICUT PASTOR.    127 "I fear," said Mr. Edmands, " that I can be no longer useful to my people." "What is the matter, pray?" asked the squire. "You must have been guilty of some conduct which has suddenly alienated your people from you, if you can do them no more good. You have been doing them good now for ten or twelve years, and I can't think they are yet perfect." "Ah, well," said Mr. Edmands; "but I think I have done all for them which I can do whilst the present feeling continues. I suspect they want a different minister." "Have they found any fault with you?" the squire asked.  They have not,"' Mr. Edmands replied. "I have not heard a word of fault found with any of my conduct; and Deacon Glover says that he has never heard a syllable uttered to my discredit." "Well, Deacon Glover, I suppose, does not approve of your proposed course?" said the squire. "Or have you had any conversation with him on the subject?" "O, yes," said Mr. Edmands; "I have talked with him freely on the subject, and I rather think it is his opinion that I had better leave." "Deacon Glover thinks you had .better go away?" said the squire. "Last fall, when I was there, he told me that the people were never better satisfied with you than they were then, and that it was the general opinion that you had not only saved the church from ruin, but that you had been the means of all the prosperity of both the church and parish. He said the people felt very grateful to you because you had been the means of so much good to them. ' Why,' said he,' our meeting house never would have needed enlargement had it not been for the kind and conciliatory course of Mr. Edmands.' The deacon cannot now think that you had better go away." "He does, for all that," said Mr. Edmands; "for he told me as much as to say 'that I might be more useful   128     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. elsewhere.' He said that he was satisfied and did not wish for any change on his own account, but that there were some of the people who did." "Who are they," asked the squire, "who are they, who wish you to go away? Did the deacon inform you?" "I asked the deacon the same question," Mr. Edmands replied; " but he said he thought he had better not inform me. He said there was not any one who had any thing against me - th t all the people respected me and loved me." "I have heard before of such honeyed reasons for the dismission of a pastor," said the squire, "and I most heartily condemn a people for their use. Why not state frankly and freely the true cause? I should think Deacon Glover would be ashamed of himself to converse with you after this manner. If I was satisfied with my minister, and there were some' who thought he had better ask for a dismission, whilst they said they respected and loved him withal, I should say to them, I would never advise him to leave, and that I would sustain him with all the power I could command." "If Deacon Glover would take this course," Mr. Ed- mands said, "he would havm great influence, I have no doubt. He might be instrumental in quelling any little excitement which might exist unfavorably to me; but I rather think he will not take a decided stand in my favor." "Has not the deacon told you of any reason urged by the people in favor of your going away?" the squire asked. "No ; he has not," was the reply. "He says there is not much of any reason given. My wife, however, tells me that she heard from old Mrs. Goldsmith that some of the people wanted a smarter man than the present pastor." "That is it, is it?" said the squire, rising and pacing the floor. "They want a smarter man."   /?.   VISIT FROM A CONNiECTICUT PA/TOl.   129 "Yes. She said that Mr. Sampso+, who bought the house and store near the tavern about a year ago, thought that the people were now able to have afirst-rate minister. They had a good large meeting house; and they might get as smart a minister as any other parish had. She said there were several young men and women who felt as Mr. Sampson did." "I suppose, then," said the squire, "that this Mr. Samp- son has been exerting himself against you pretty much ever since he moved into town. As he has some property and can-make a good appearance, people look up to him some. Probably he has flattered Deacon Glover consid- erably, and inflamed his pride, and fixed him up for an in- strument to aid in your dismission. It may be Mr. Samp- son has made the deacon feel that the parish will run down if they do not have what he would call a smart man. Well, how does Deacon Greene feel?" !"The deacon, at first," Mr. Edmands answered, " was very warm in denouncing the whole movement. He talked with me with tears in his eyes when I first spoke to him about going away; but last week I saw him again, and I inferred that he was leaning towards Deacon Glov- er in feeling." "Did not Deacon Greene tell you that Mr. Sampson wanted you to go because he wanted a smarter preacher?" the squire inquired. "He did not," Mr. Edmands said. "He told me, at my first interview with him, that he did not know of any one who wished for another minister, though he had heard there were some who had such a wish. He then said he hoped that I would not think of going--that he never would vote to have me dismissed. Last week when I saw him I did not ask him if he knew who wished me to leave, nor did he tell me. I considered it strange that he shoufi appear so reconciled to my going away when he   130     A VOICt ft OM tit PAUSONA6d. was so strenuous for my continuance the first time I con. versed with him on the subject." "He lives one side, you know," said the squire, "' and don't see many people, Probably he had not seen Deacon Glover nor heard any thing from him in relation to the case when you first saw him. Before your. second inter- view he had conversed with Deacon Glover, and probably -was influenced by him; as I have long known he is ina elined to hearken to what he says." "Yes," said Mr. Edmands; "he told me when I last saw him that he had heard nothing only from Deacon Glover." "That is the way 'tis done," sald the squire. "One or two restless spirits in a parish, for some pretence or other, wish for another minister; they get up a little commotion, and then go to a deacon, and either flatter or frighten him, or both, and get him started on their side. He puts in a paddle with them  and rthe waters a little, and by and by some others join; and in this way they soon have the poor minister all spattered over; and then the multitude begin to cry, he is so spotted that we must have another minister. Well, Mr. Edmands, from what you tell me, I think pretty much as you do -that your usefulness among your people is over whilst the present feeling continues. You have given me no new in- formation; for I had a lettertfrom sister a short time ago, in which she stated to me the substance of what you have now related." "Ah," said Mr. Edmands. "Has your sister written to you upon the subject? Had I been aware of that, I would not have been so particular in my :statements." "I thought such might be the case," the squire replied; "and, being anxious to have a correct account of the matter, I thought I would not apprise you that I was in any way informed respecting your difficulties. Sister's 44   VISIT FROM A COXtECTICUT PASTOR s   ll letter and your conversation essentially agree. I will read you what she Wrote on the subject." "I should be happy to hear," Mr. Edmands replied. The squire, taking the letter from his desk, read as follows:-- "You will be very much surprised to learn that there is some trouble here in relation to our good minister. Not- withstanding our fond hopes that he would be permitted to spend his days with us, I fear we shall be disappointed. It seems that Mr. Sampson, who bought the store and house here about a year ago, has never thought that Mr. Edmands was a very great man, and has been exerting himself to raise a party against him. He has not, how- ever, obtained many to join him in open opposition. There are a few young men here, over whom Mr. Sampson has had great influence, who sympathize with him. They have been very active of late in their efforts to prejudice peo- ple against Mr. Edmands. As they belong to different families, their influence will be felt. It is said Deacon Glover has become much alarmed, and fears the parish will be broken up if Mr. Edmands does not ask for a dis- mission, and that he thinks he had better do it. It seems very strange to me that the people are willing to lose Mr. Edmands when there are so many here who esteem him so highly. If his friends would only bestir themselves and take a decided stand, I have no fear that Mr. Edmands will go ; but somehow or other they are disinclined to move. I have heard a great many say that they set every thing by our pastor and cannot bear the thought of his leaving; and yet they don't do any thing to show their warm attachment or to put down the opposition. I was talking with Mr. Rawson the other day, and he said it was really too bad for Mr. Sampson to come into town to make trouble and excite opposition to our minister; but that   132    A VOICE FR'OM THE PARSONAGE. he did not know but it would be the easiest way to have peace to let JMr. Edmands go. Deacon Greene, they say, talks pretty much in the same manner. All say that Mr. Edmands is a good, nice man, that he has been the means of doing a great deal of good here, and that they never shall have another minister who will be so much devoted to the spiritual good of the people; and yet they will be still and let a few turn him away. I think Mr. Edmands's friends act very wickedly in not rallying around him and manifesting a strong determination to keep him. If Dea- con Glover would take a firm stand in his favor he would stay, I know, for the deacon has great influence; but he is afraid, if he acts in favor of the minister, the church will be destroyed and the meeting house de- serted. He says it will not injure JMr. Edmands to go; he is such a good man that he will soon find another place. Now, I think it will be a great damage to Mr. Edmands to go. He has built him a pretty house, and has set out a great many trees, and the people have encouraged him all along with the belief that he would spend his days among them. If he should go away, I am much afraid he will be discouraged and- will never again labor with the zeal and resolution he has manifested here. When I think upon the subject I am almost distracted. Only think -a good; faithful, and successful minister being driven away by six or eight individuals, when the great body of the people are satisfied with him, and yet will not exert them- selves to have him remain through fear the parish will be Broken to pieces! I wish you were here as one of'the parish; for I know you would not be afraid to act. I understand Mr. Edmands is going to Boston the latter part of the month ' and I presume he will call and see you on his Way. I hppe you will comfort him all you can." "That isla 'very kind expression of feeling towards you," the squire retnarked, as he folded the letter.   VISIT OF A CONNECTICUT PASTOR.    133 "Certainly it is," Mr. Edmands replied. "I am obliged to her for it." "Do you owe any thing on your place?" the squire in- quired.. "No, sir, I do not; I paid the last dollar for it about six months ago." "That is good," said the squire. "Well, I suppose the place would sell for more than it cost you, as property has advanced there considerably within a few years." ( I suppose it would," Mr. Edmands replied. "It might sell for two or three hundred dollars more. Mr. Sampson would like to buy it, I guess, for his son.- He has asked me several times if I would sell." "He has?" said the squire. "Well, I should not be surprised if he has been actuated by some selfish motive in his opposition too you as much as by a desire for a smarter preacher. His son is in business with him, I sup- pose." "Not yet, I believe," Mr. Edmands replied. "He is about twenty years old. The report is, that when he is of age he is going into partnership with his father." "Yes, yes," said the squire, ' I see. Your house is near his store, and a very pretty house it, is too. You have a variety of fruit trees and of shrubbery which are now val- uable, and the eye of Mr. Sampson has been directed that way. If, now, you go away and wish to sell your place, you just let me know if Mr. Sampson makes you an offer for it. If it is not as much as you think the place worth, I will make 'you an dffer too. You need not fear that you shall lose any thing by building. You have been settled, I think, about eleven years," said the squire, " and are now about thirty-five years of age?" "I was somewhat advanced when I graduated," Mr. Ed- mands answered, " and afterwards I taught school three years for the purpose, of paying some of my college bills 12   134     A VOICE PROM TTIE PARSONAGE. and of getting a little something for my expenses in the theological seminary. I was not settled till I was thirty. one years old." "You are now forty-two," said the squire, "and the best part of your life has been spent with your present charge, doing them good--great good. You have now five children. Well, it is a hard case to be obliged to seek a new home, I confess."    \ "I think it is," Mr. Edmands replied ; " and I dread it. A dismissed minister does not have so fair a prospect of being settled as one who has never been ordained." "Many times that is true," said the-squire; " but I hope there will be no difficulty in your case. You ought not to be under the necessity of seeking a new parish. I can- not get over the conduct of some of your people in being willing to have you leave merely to gratify the pride and perhaps advance the pecuniary interest of one or two in- dividuals. If, you should go, I shall feel that God will visit this iniquity on the church in some way or other, to bring them to realize what they have done. I have known of instances where good and faithful ministers have been dismissed for reasons as weak and wicked as those which are influencing your people, and their par- ishes have smarted under the scourging of divine Provi- dence." Soon after Mr. Edmands returned home he was induced to request a dismission from his people. He advertised his house for sale, and it was not long before Mr. Samp- son made him an offer for it--less by two hundred' dollars than it cost. One or two other similar offers were ten- dered. At last Mr. Edmands wrote to the squire and ap- prised him of the matter; and in return he received a letter from his friend, in which he made. him an offer of three hundred dollars morebthan would cover the expense of building. Accordingly, the squire became the pur-   VISIT OF A CONNECTICUT PASTOR.    135 chaser. He had not been in possession of the estate many months before Mr. Sampson made proposals to him to buy'. The squire fixed his price, which was two hundred dollars in advance of what he paid; and, after vain at- tempts on the part of Mr., Sampson to induce him to take less, he paid the squire his price and received a deed. The squire enclosed the two lundred dollars to Mr. Ed- mands and was satisfied altogether with the speculation, with the reflection that he had saved one minister at least from the jaws of a shark. The reader, and especially if he be a minister, and one, too, who has been dismissed, with a valued house and cher- ished fruit trees planted and nurtured by his own hands in his possession, will doubtless think that a Squire David- son is not in every community.   CtHAPTER XI. A DESTITUTE PARISH. MR. ELDRIDGE, having been settled about eight years, had acquired a high reputation in the community and was a  favorite clergyman in the adjacent parishes. Consequent- ly, in the absence of regular pastors on journeys or other- wise, his services were often requested in the solemniza- tion of marriages and in the attendance of funerals. No pastor in the region performed so much out of his own parish as was 'rendered by Mr. Eldridge. Death having deprived a somewhat large society of a highly re- spectable and beloved pastor, after the members of the association to which the deceased belonged had alter- nately supplied the pulpit for the benefit of the widow and children, his people began to hear candidates for settle- ment. Being a desirable location, many individuals were recommended to the committee of supply by clergymen and others as being well worthy to succeed to the pastoral office among them. The people were led to believe from the large number of candidates thus recommended that they were an important people ; and of course they erected such a standard of ministerial perfection as made it neces- sary to bear candidate after candidate. Though all had a high standard, vet there were not many among the peo- ple who had the same ideal of the man who was worthy (136)   A DESTITUTE PARISH.       137 of the place in their pulpit and affections. It had not e been noised abroad that they were remarkably discrimi- nating and speculative in their theology; but in their new position it came out that there were old schoolmen and new, Hopkinsians, &c. They were not known abroad as a remarkably literary people; for the reason, perhaps, that so long a time had elapsed since they were favored with a settled ministry, and there was no particular occasion of their manifesting all that they knew. But now it was sur- prising to notice the value they placed on scholastic ac- complishments and literary attainments. Their neigh- bors in adjoining parishes had not supposed from their every-day manifestations that pride -had much to do with them ; but their mistake was duly discovered and acknowl- edged before the eighteenth candidate departed. In the period of their destitution, after a large number of young men and men in middle life had been to this parish, tried in the balances and found wanting, a request was made by one of the deacons, who went over to -see Mr. Eldridge, that he would preach the lecture prepara- tory to their sacramental occasion. With this request Mr. Eldridge agreed to comply, and accordingly went over and :fulfilled his engagement. Before the services he had no conversation with any one of the people; for he did not arrive in town till about the hour at which the lecture was appointed. As he was well known to- the people and highly respected by them, there were many in waiting in the aisles, and in the porch and yard of the church, to take him by the hand and have a little conver- sation with him. If they all had been a special committee appointed for the very purpose, they could not have better discharged the duty of consulting him in regard to their condition and of inquiring for a suitable man for their pastor. When he descended from the pulpit and had reached 12    138     A -VOICE FROM1 THE PARSONAGE. the aisle, he was first saluted by a good old lady, who manifested great joy at seeing him once more. "I've been wi shing a long time to see you, Mr. El- dridge," she said; " for I thought you'd know of a good minister for us." "I hear, my good friend," Mr. Eldridge replied, " that you have had a large number of good men to preach for you of late.- Were 'there none among them who would answer?" "I know we've had a great many candidates ; but, some- how or other, the people don't take to any of them. We ought to have a settled minister here; for we now have no one to attend funerals and see the sick." "Well, ma'am, if I could help you to a pastor it would give me great pleasure." Passing on a step or two, Mr. Eldridge w'as greeted by a gentleman and his wife, who were very glad to see him. Said the lady,- "Mr. Eldridge, what do you think is going to become of us? Do you think we can ever find a pastor who will answer for us?" "I hope so, certainly," Mr. Eldridge replied. "Well, I am almost discouraged," said the lady. "I do not see any prospect of our being suited." "Have not any of the individuals who have preached for you given satisfaction?"Mr. Eldridge, inquired. "Some of them ought- to have satisfied us," the lady re- plied; "for we have had already no less than forty-three different candidates." "That is a lalrge number out of which to make a choice," Mr. Eldridge observed. "Have you not been united in any of them?" "No, sir, we have not," said the husband; "and I think it is discouraging."  "I am fearful," Mr. Eldridge remarked, "that your   A DESTITUTE PARISH.       1 ' church do not look aright to the great Shepherd to send. them a pastor after his own heart; for, if he is properly inquired of, he will answer prayer." "That is what I have been telling our people," said the lady. "We forget God, and are trying to please ourselves." Stepping a little farther, Mr. Eldridge was brought to a circle of four ladies and gentlemen. Said one of the gentlemen, - "Mr. Eldridge, don't you think it is time we had a pastor?" "I do, most assuredly.'" Said another gentleman,- "Do you think we shall -ever find any bne who will unite us?" "If among the forty-three candidates you have had, as I am just informed that is the number, there was none fitted for you, I do not see much prospect of there being onefound, I confess, who will unite you," Mr. Eldridge replied. "I have known of your having had preach for you some of the very best of men; and there were two or three young men in the number who for talents and promise are equal to any."' "I know," said one of the gentlemen, "we have had most excellent men here to preach for us, but none of them seemed to unite us." "I should think from your remarks," said another gen- tleman, "that it is your opinion that we ought to have been united in some one of the ministers who have preached for us. I would like to know which of them you mean." "There is Rev. Mr. Allen, who preached for you four Sabbaths, he told me; and a better minister I do not know," Mr. Eldridge replied. "Well," said the last gentleman, "he was a good preacher, and he suited tolerably well; but some of the /.   "O     A VOICE F ROM THE PARSONAGE. people thought he would not answer because he had not a very good delivery." "He is thought to be a very good speaker," Mr. El- dridge said. "Perhaps he is not the very best; but he is muchimore than an ordinary orator." "He would have suited us if it had not been for this one thing." ," What was the matter with that Mr. Lane who preached here?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "Mr. Lane, Mr. Lane," repeated the gentleman. "I do not seem to remember him." "O, that little man, father,"' said his wife, -" that little man that they talked so much about." "O, yes, I remember now - Mr. Lane. O, he would not answer for us; he was nothing more than a mere boy. As soon as he was seen entering the pulpit we all thought he would not answer; for he was not dignified enough for u8." "That was all: the objection to him, was it," said Mr. Eldridge, " his small stature?" "'I never heard of any other. His preaching all liked very much," said the gentleman. "'Well, what objection was there to Mr. Reed?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "We ought to have settled him," said one of the ladies. "He was a fine preacher, and a very sociable, pleasant man. He was very well liked; but, because he had red hair, some of the people said they could not vote for him. They 'aid the hair was a small circumstance; but it made some talk among the young folks, and that, when they were about it, they might as well as not get a minister who was good looking."  "Yes," said Mr. Eldridge; "I suppose your people thirf they can have what minister they please, if'they can only find one who will please them."   A DESTITUTE PARISH.      141 "That is it," another of the ladies remarked ; "that is just what I have often told some of the people. They think any minister would accept a call to settle here. pro* vided a call was given. Such a feeling I do not like my- self. I think it will be some t!mo before we get a pastor unless the people alter some of their notions." . "I am fearful that this may be the case," Mr. Eldridge replied. "I don't believe in being so particular about every little thing in a minister," the last lady said. "I think it is very:sinful. Now, we have had, I believe, some 'of the very best of ministers to preach for us. Almost any one of them was, if any thing, too good for us; and yet some little trifling thing or other has kept us from giving a call to either of them." "You know, Mrs. Dimmick," said one of the gentlemen, "we were going to give a call to one of them, but -- " "Yes, yes," she said. "There was, a-clergyman from New York who preached here one Sabbath who was out of health, and was spending a few weeks in the town where the young man who was then supplying us resided. It being communion Sabbath, and as the young man was not ordained, he requested this New York minister to come over and administer the sacrament. This circum- stance was not generally known, and so he was taken for a candidate of course; for every one who preached here ,was looked upon as a candidate. This man was not liked by many at first, because he spoke ,so low; but when they found out that he was settled in the city they were going to give him a call. They would really have done this had ! not the young man, when he came back, told us it would ,',do no good." "I neuer heard of this before," Mr. Eldridge remarked, "Perhaps the New York minister wrould have felt himself highly honored with a callfrom your people."   -142    A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGE. "Our people feel a little mortified: about this," Mrs. Dimmick continued, "and don't like to hear any thing about it." After this manner did our Mr. Eldridge make his egress from the pulpit through the aisle to the porch of the church, where he met with others, who, before they left him, had something to say of their prospects of having a settled minister. Why they remained destitute when they had so many candidates, some assigned one reason and some another; and it was a fact which made no slight impression on Mr. Eldridge's mind that no two individuals assigned the same reason; yet all appeared extremely anx- ious to have a pastor, and were willing to submit to almost any sacrifice if they could only obtain theright kind of a man. When he reached the yard and was making his way to the shed back of the church, where he left his carriage, he was followed by three gentlemen, whom he found to be the committee for supplying the pulpit. They seemed to think that they had a pretty difficult task to fulfil, and all were rejoicing that the annual meeting of the parish was near, when they could resign their comlmitteeship into other hands. One of them remarked,-  "I had no idea that we should be troubled so to find- a minister to suit us. I thought there were a plenty of min- isters, and that we should find the right kind of a man in two months; but I have been sadly disappointed. Minis- ters are rather scarce, I should think; are they not, Mr. Eldridge? The gentleman appeared so sincere in his bewailment over the dearth of candidates that Mr. Eldridge found it no easy matter to so adjust his facial expression as not to betray the true sentiments of his heart as his laughing powers should have full play; for he was thinking of the forty-three candidates the parish had already had ; but he succeeded in preserving his equilibrium and gravity, and coolly remarked, -   A DESTITUTE PARISH.      143 "I fear there may be a scarcity of ministers, if there be not one already." "We've had a pretty hard time of it," said another of the committee; " and, for my part, I am completely dis- couraged. I have been to Boston six or eight times on purpose to inquire of the city ministers if they could hnot send us the right kind of a man; and I have been to An- dover four times on the same errand. I told the profess- ors there what kind of a minister we must have; and yet here we are without a pastor and without any prospect of one, so far as I can see." "Did not the professors think they could send you a suitable man?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "O, yes; they mentioned several young men, who they said were very promisingas to talents and piety; and I went and saw them all, aild agreed with them to come here one after another if it should be-necessary." "Did they all come?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "Yes, sir; they all came, every man of them, one after the other, and preached; but neither of them wasjust the thing for us."  "It is extremely unfortunate," Mr. Eldridge remarked, "that there is no one to be found who is just the man for you." "Well," the last gentleman said, "I am going to make one pull more for a pastor; and if I don't succeed, I've done. I am going to start next week for New York, to see if there ain't some ministers that way. We've tried prett:y much all we could hear of in this region." Said Mr. Eldridge with great solemnity and earnest- ness,- "Gentlemen, it appears to me that pull, as you ,call it, is not so good a one as another I could mention." This remark of Mr. Eldridge excited hope in the minds of all the gentlemen that relief would speedily be brought   "4     A VOICE FROM TRE PARSONAXE. to them in the person of a clergyman whom he could recommend as being just the man- to unite all parties and humor all tastes. Particularly the one who was design. ing to make one more "pull" was unusually excited, and at once asked,- "' What is your plan, Mr. Eldridge?  "Since I have been here," Mr. Eldridge replied,- "since I have been here, engaged in conversation for a few moments,'I think I have learned from one and another what is the real condition of this people. It has been ira. pressed upon my mind that you did not realize what you wanted in a pastor, and had not looked to the great Be- ing who giveth pastors and teachers, and asked of him, with humility and submission, to send you a suitable min- ister. Now, my advice to you is, to stop hearing candi- dates for a few weeks, and get your pulpit supplied by some one who does not wish to settle, and, in the mean time, for your church and people to humble themselves before God and seek from him a pastor. If you do this sincerely, I have no doubt that the Lord would inter- pose and send you a pastor in whom you all will be united," Whilst Mr. Eldridge was thus speaking it was observed that the gentlemen of the committee - and particularly the one who was intending to make another "pull"- were somewhat abashed and disconcerted; for after he had done there was profound silence, neither of them having an answer at hand. At length one said,-- "I think your advice, Mr. Eldridge, is very good; and I will mention it to the people." Mr. Eldridge had no more interruptions and proceeded to his carriage, in wlhich he was soon'conveyed to the house of Deacon Follet, where he had engaged to stop for tea. When he entered the house he found there an old clerical friend of his own as well as of the deacon, who a   A DESTITUTE PARISH.      145 few moments before had rode up to make a call as he was passing on to his home in a neighboring town. "You were detained some time," Mrs. Follet remarked, "were you not, Mr. Eldridge, by our people? We waited at church a few moments for you ; but, seeing you busy in conversation, Mr. Follet said we would go on without you." "I have had quite a time of it," Mr. Eldridge replied; "but I have acquired a pretty good knowledge of the state of your people. I had no idea you were in such a condition." "I suppose," said Mrs. Follet, " the 'people have been talking to you about a minister. That seems to be the- only topic of conversation nowadays." "Yes; they have," Mr. Eldridge replied; "and, from what they said, I think your parish is not in a very hope- ful condition." "We are in a most dreadful condition," Mrs. Follet re- marked. "There is no such thing as a minister's suiting us. I don't know what will be the result. Sometimes I think we shall be broken all to pieces. Only think, we've had above forty different ministers preach for us since last December,--not quite a year, - and none of them seemed' to answer but one! A gentleman from New York preached last summer one Sabbath; but the people did not know who he was or where he was from at the time. They sup- posed he was a candidate of course ; and there were some who thought he would not answer; but when it was as- certained that he was from New York the case changed, and there was quite a stir about a parish meeting for the purpose of giving him a call; and I really believe they would have done this had not Mr. Byron, who was then supplying for us, assured the people that it would be of no avail." The deacon coming in from  the barn, where he had 13   "6     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. been to take care of Mr. Eldridge' horse, Mrs. Follet observed,- "Husband, Mr. Eldridge has had quite a time of it at the meeting house since lecture. He has heard considera. ble news about us here." "I presume so," said the deacon. "' I dare say he has been applied to by a dozen or more to recommend can- didates." "Well, deacon," said Mr. Eldridge, "I shall not recom- mend any candidates to you at present. I think there have been already far too many." "That is a fact," said the deacon; " and if I were in your place I would not encourage such a state of things as we have here. Our people are not in a fit condition to hear candidates. They don'tlknow what they want. We have now had forty or more good men here, and yet none of them suited. Some were too short and some too tall; some had light hair and some red; some had too many children and others had not any; some were old-school men and others new; some walked too moderately and were lazy; others walked too fast and were not dignified; some stammered and others talked like lightning; and in this way one little foolish thing or other has been raised into a bughear to keep us from having a settled minister." " O husband," said Mrs. Follet, "you are exaggerating. No one has objected to any of the ministers on account of their hair." "Yes, my dear, there has. Mr. Olney and Mr. White had no other objection to Mr. Reed but his red hair." "How do you know that?" the wife inquired. "O, it leaked out through their children," the deacon replied. "I knew they were not inclined to settle Mr.'Reed,"   A DESTITUTE PARISH.      147 Mr. Follet said. ' I asked Mrs. Olney one day what ob- jection she had to him. I saw she did not seem ready to answer, and that she had no very definite objection. I should not think they woulad object to a man's hair, if what was under it was good." "I rather suspect," Mr. Eldridge remarked, "that you are not among the difficult ones, Mrs. Follet." "I think," she replied, " that I could have been satis- fied with almost any one of the candidates we have had. Our people ought to have been united in one of them and settled him before this. A large part of them have been ordained or installed over other parishes, some of which, for numbers, wealth, and intelligence, are. far before our own." "Then you think all parishes are not as difficult and fastidious as yours?" "Indeed I do,' Mrs. Follet replied, "though I think a very wrong spirit enters very often into a people when looking for a pastor." "There are some parishes, however," Mr. Eldridge ob- served, " when destitute of a pastor, who act with great wisdom and with much Christian principle. They show themselves to be competent judges of the qualifications of a pastor." "Yes," said Mrs. Follet, "I know there are some such parishes. It really does one good to think of them. They: do not appear to feel that they must have perfection in a pastor, and wait and wait, hearing different ministers continually, in expectation of finding perfection at last. However, parishes of this description at the present time are few and far between. The great majority, when hear- ing candidates, are in the exercise of a very improper spirit." "I do not know but that is true," said Mr. Eldridge. "I see too much of such a spirit, I confess." ; O   "8     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "It is melancholy," said Mr. Harris, the clergyman be. fore alluded to,--" it is melancholy to notice the fastidi- ousness of many of our parishes when they are seeking to settle a minister. I have thought that the influence of this feeling has checked a desire on the part of young men to study for the ministry." "It may have been one cause to produce this result," Mr. Eldridge said. "Many pious young men, I know, when they leave college study other professions. It is by no means surprising that a young man should be affected by such a state of things as we know exists among this people, for instance." "It was new to me," said Mr. Harris, "that the people here have already had upwards of forty candidates. They have rather surpassed the people in G' ." "Have not the people there yet settled a minister? I thought brother Swift was going there," said Mr. El- dridge. "No; the call was not sufficiently unanimous to suit him," Mr. Harris said. "There was a large minority who were opposed to his settlement." "I am really sorry to hear of this," said Mr. Eldridge; "for I was hoping that parish was now satisfied. Who is preaching there now?" "Mr. Anybody, I believe,' said Mr. Harris. "Well, there are quite a number of clergymen by that name," said Mr. Eldridge. "I very often hear of them in vacant parishes, and I think they must be a very poor supply." "But a little better than Mr. Nobody, I think," said the deacon. "'1 From what I have heard," said Mr. Harris, " since I have been here, I should think the parish in G to be very much like this people. I was conversing the other day with brother'Thompson, who formerly was settled there,   A DESTITUTE PARISH..      149 but who was dismissed-on account of ill health. In remark- ing about his old people, he said, ' They are in a sad state there now.' He recently received a letter from one of his former parishioners, from which he inferred that the pros- pect of their having a pastor was very dark. He read to me a paragraph descriptive of the state of things there, which so accurately portrays the condition of many other parishes when hearing candidates that' I was induced to request of him a copy, which he at once wrote and gave me. I put it in my wallet; and I believe I have it with me now, and will read iS if you please." "If it describes our case," said the deacon, "I should like to hear it; for Iicannot believe there is any other parish so difficult as ours." "You can judge now for yourself," said Mr. Harris, as he proceeded to read as follows : "' We have no settled minister yet, and I do not know as there is any prospect of our having one very soon. From thirty to forty, dif- ferent men have preached here ; but not a perfect man was there in the whole lot. One preached too long, another was too brief; one was too slow, another spoke too fast; one spoke too loud, another quite too low ; some were too flowery in their style of writing, others quite too plain and old fashioned; one was too proud, and did not suit because he was married; still another because he was not married. Now we are very anxious to settle a' minister; but we are probably setting our standard quite too high. " "That is a pretty good description of our case," said the deacon. "Where do you say that place is, Mr. Harris?" "G  ," was the reply. "O, yes," said the deacon; "I know where it is. I have been there." "Well," said Mrs. Follet, "I think we have had quite too many candidates. I wish the people had done here 13-*   150    A VOICE FROM: THE PARSONAGE. as they did in the place where my father lives. Dr E. wished for a colleague, and the people were inclined to comply with his request. Before the time ceame, however, for him to quit preaching, he urged upon- the people the importance of not having many candidates. It is not neces- sary, he said, to hear many, and besides, he said, there was much evil occasioned by so doing. The people be- come divided. A few become attached to one candidate and a few to another ;'anxd so one party, by and by, will not like the man popular with the other party, out of re: venge. 'Now," said he, 'my advice to you is, to inquire for some suitable young man to come here and preach. If one be recommended, let the committee make very par- ticular examination of those who are well acquainted with him as to his talents, piety, acquisitions, discretion, &c. If after this examination they are satisfied that the young man would be a proper person, let the committee go and see him; and if from his appearance they infer that they have had a correct account of him, let them partly engage him to come and preach a few Sabbaths. I would not,' the doctor said, 'have him fully engaged until the committee had returned home and made known to the people the result of their interview, and ascertained if there was any probability of their being united in him. If the people then favor his coining and seem inclined- to give him a call, if he "makes good the representations which have been made of'him, then I would have the young man sent for and employed to preach.' "' "That is very judicious and most excellent advice, I should think," Mr. Eldridge remarked. "I hope the peo- ple followed it." "Yes, sir, they did; and they did not hear but one can- didate. No one preached before Mr. Kingsbury; and the people, by being prepared to like him, were well satisfied with him, and gave him a call, -which he accepted. The * '    A DESTITUTE PARISH.       151 committee made inquiries about quite a number of men and went to see several of them ; but they did not feel satisfied that any one of them would answer whom they could obtain but Mr. Kingsbury."- "I advised the committee here this afternoon," Mr El- dridge said, "to pursue a- course which might lead to a similar result. I advised them to suspend hearing candi- dates for the present, and to urge upon the church the importance of humbling themselves before God for their past sinfulness, and especially for not looking to him for a pastor. I told them, if they would do this in sincerity, I thought the time would not be distant before they would have sent unto them a pastor in whom all would be united." "That is good advice," said the deacon ; "and I rather think it will have some effect." - t   ,CHAPTER     XII. ,1 , . Qk  MSS BEMS. "Do you think you will be able to visit Mrs. Clay, my dear, this afternoon?" inquired Mr. Eldridge of his wife. "I have been making my arrangements to do so, hus- band. I think it will do to leave Mary in the care of Hannah, she is so comfortable. She is usually contented, I perceive, when Hannah is with her." "I am pleased -to hear you say this," Mr. Eldridge re- plied; " for I was fearful that you might not be inclined to go. I think it will be perfectly safe and proper to leave daughter with Hannah." "Were I to consult my own feelings," said Mrs. E1- dridge, "I should much prefer visiting Mrs. Clay at some other time; for you know I am not very partial to these large parties." "There will not be many there, will there, wife?" "O, yes, dear. Did I not tell you that Mrs. Clay re- marked, when she called to invite us, that she was intend- ing to ask all her acquaintance in town and some from other places? ' "You might have said so," Mr. Eldridge replied ; "but I have hardly thought of the visit; for you know how en- tirely engrossed I have been of late witlhthat translation. If Mrs. Clay is intending to have so many of her friends together I think we ought to go; for she would be much (152)   MSS BEMS.         153 disappointed if we were not there. Mrs. Davidson would like to have you ride with her." - "Yes, dear; she sent word over this morning that she would be happy to have me accompany her, but that she could not be ready before late in the afternoon." When Mrs. Davidson and Mrs. Eldridge arrived at Mrs. Clay's, they found a large collection of ladies both from their own town and other places. The company was much larger than they had anticipated; but, being generally old acquaintances, their presence was for their increased satisfaction. Mrs. Davidson was particularly happy in recognizing some of her friends whom she had not met for a considerable length of time. The evening brought an accession to the assemblage in the gentlemen who be- longed to the different families with which the ladies were connected. As is usual in such gatherings, large and small circles were seen, made up of individuals of similarity in tastes, or between whom existed strong friendship. For a while Mrs. Davidson was surrounded by several of her particu- lar friends in animated conversation on different matters; and so happy were they, as an occasional loud laugh testi- fied, that the attention of others was directed to them, with the remark that there must be something very amus- ing going on where they were. It turned out that the source of their interest was in the conversation of Mrs. Whately with Mrs. Davidson on scenes she had lately witnessed in a journey for the benefit of her health. This being the fact, and the others perceiving that Mrs.'David- son and Mrs. Whately had very much to say to each other, though by no means manifesting a disrelish for the society of those around them, one after another changed their locality,y till the two friends were left entirely by themselves in one corner of the parlor. When thus alone, Mrs. Davidson remarked, -   A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "We seem to be left to ourselves, Mrs. Whately." "So it appears," Mrs. Whately replied; "and I will now improve the opportunity of asking you who that lady is, sitting by the side of Mr. Eldridge, who has been conversing with him for so long a time." "That is Miss BEMIS," said Mrs. Davidson, " a member of our church." "She seems to be rather partial to your minister, I should think," Mrs. Whately observed ; "for I see she has been conversing with him pretty much ever since he came in." "She has probably been giving him some advice or mak- ing some suggestions as to his duty," Mrs. Davidson said. "She appears to feel as if the care and oversight of the parish devolved upon her. She is quite a ministerial sort of a lady, and very fond of being noticed by the clergy." "Is she a minister's daughter ?" Mrs. Whately inquired. "0, no," said Mrs. Davidson.   "Her fater r was a farmer in moderate circumstances. He lived and died in this town. She formerly lived with Mr. Loring, w ho was settled here before Mr. Eldridge came, and was made con- siderable of in his family. She there saw much of minis- ters, and has since always manifested a large share of interest in their matters." " Where does she now live ?" Mrs. Whately asked. "She has a room in Mr. Bently's house, near Mr. Dixon's store. She is rather poor, and takes in sewing, binds shoes, and can turn her hand to a variety of things." "Is she not over nice ? From her appearance I should think she was," said Mrs. Whately. " What makes you think so ? " said Mrs. Davidson, with a very expressive smile. "I don't know; but she appears to me to be one of your very particular sort of persons." "She has that character here in town," Mrs. Davidson    MISS BEMIS.                155 replied. " She thinks she is a sort of a standard. I rather suspect she feels competent to. decide almost any point of propriety. At any rate, she takes it upon herself thus to decide." "She is pretty free, then, to express her opinions, is she not?" said Mrs. Whately. "She is not at all backward, I assure you," Mrs. David- son said, " especially in matters pertaining to the minister or the church and parish. She exacts a great deal of the whole of us, minister and all. There is no such thing as any of us doing enough- we are always behindhand in some thing, not up to the mark in any thing. My husband can hardly endure her. She is very much given to making comparisons between the engagedness of Christians here and those elsewhere, and between Mr. Eldridge's preach- ing and his activity among the people and the preaching and conduct of other ministers. She is so very particular as to be seldom satisfied."  "She is a very engaged Christian herself, I suppose," said Mrs. Whately. "Her own mark is high, and she thinks others ought to have a similar standard." Mrs. Davidson smiled and said, "If speaking of the failures of others, and being of constant annoyance to her pastor and others, by her improper interference with his concerns and those of his family, make an engaged Chris- tian, Miss Bemis is surely such a one. We think she keeps her eye too much abroad and not enough within." "I should think," said Mrs Whately, " that Mr. Eldridge would endeavor to show her the sin of such conduct, and persuade her to change her character in this respect." "I rather think," said Mrs. Davidson, " M. Eldridge will not make the attempt. He has a very correct idea of her character." "If she is given to censure," said Mrs. Whately, "and if her remarks lead to mischief, I really think your minis-  156     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. ter ought to attempt to make her sensible of her influence and induce her to amend." "She is so very severe on ministers and on Mr. Eldridge and his wife that he is not inclined to enter into any very personal conversation with her. It would not do any good if he should." "Ah," said Mrs. Whately, " does Miss Bemis allow her- self to speak hard of Mr. Eldridge? I should think, from the manner in which she treats him this evening, that she was one of his warmest friends." "I told you, you recollect," said Mrs. Davidson, "that she loves to be noticed by the clergy. She would be much flattered if they would notice her enough to follow her dictations. She prides herself so much on her knowl- edge of ministerial duties as qualifies her, in her own opinion, to give ministers important instructions." "She is a sort of ministerial supervisor, I should think, from what you say," said Mrs. Whately, " and church -mem- bers' guide." "I never heard her called by such title," Mrs. Davidson replied. "If should be added, 'and advisor or guardian of the ministers wife,' the title would be more complete, and would well apply to Miss Bemis. A   minister and his family must walk on her line, or be reported in no very measured terms as extremely delinquent." As this last remark was, finished, Mrs. Durant, from another town, approached the two ladies and seated her- self, saying she thought they ought not to engross so much of ea'ch other's society. "We   are very happy to have your company," said Mrs. Davidson ;."for we are talking just now on a subject that has interested you, I believe." "What is that?" inquired Mrs. Durant. "You may remember," said Mrs. Davidson, ' when my husband and myself spent an afternoon with you last   MSS BEMS.        157 spring, your conversation with me about Miss Simons, of your parish." "O, yes," said Mrs. Durant; "but you have not been talking about her this evening, have you?" "We have not been talking about her," said Mrs. David- son, "but we have about one lice her." "You have no such character over here, I hope," said Mrs. DIurant, with great feeling. "I rather think," Mrs. Davidson replied, " your place is not peculiar for having these ministerial supervisors, as Mrs. Whately calls them." Mrs. Durant, laughing heartily at this apt denomination of character, remarked " that her friend was peculiarly fortunate in her title for such individuals. They are very troublesome, very mischievous, persons. They are so an- noying to ministers and their wives, and so very 'meddle- some in what does not concern them, that I haJve no sort  of patience with them. I really believe they, occasion more uneasiness in parishes than almost. any other cause of trouble, and are oftener the primary instruments in the dismission of ministers than is usually imagined.' "You are excited," Mrs. Whately remarked. "I know I am," said Mrs. Durant. "As I said, I have no patience with these meddling sort of folks, who are eternally prying into a minister's affairs and constantly deserting him, and who are running hither and thither about the parish with the news they pick up in regard to the minister and his wife or children, making a mountain often out of nothing. I have seen so much evil brought about by these individuals that I hold them an intolerable nuisance. Has Mrs. Davidson been saying any thing to you, Mrs. Whately, of our Miss Simons." "She has not. I have never heard of her before," Mrs, Whately replied. "Well," continued Mrs. Durant, " she occasions a good "   158     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. deal of commotion among us, I assure you. She might not be taken to be such a character on a slight acquaint- ance, being of a retiring habit and not very talkative ; but then it is in her to do vast mischief in a parish. I have no doubt she is a pious woman, and is really anxious to have the cause of Christ prosper; but she is so con- tracted in her views as to be a very incompetent judge of many things pertaining to the conduct of ministers or of the members of the church; yet with a certain class she has great influence, and she excites them often to dangerous action. They hear Miss Simons's stories about the minister and some prominent members of the church, and forthwith report all over the parish; and in this way; we have every now and then quite an explosion." "How does Miss Simons collect her materials for stir- ring up such a strife?"Mrs. Whately inquired. "O, she visits at our minister's considerably," Mrs. Du- rafit replied, "' and is abroad among the people very much. It puzzles me to account for her conduct when she is so retiring in her manners and not a very great talker. If she was a great talker I could well reconcile her conduct. When she visits the people treat her with much attention, but many of them are very careful not to give her any occasion to talk. She, however, makes occasion. A half hour in our parsonage often gives her material for accom- plishing a great deal. Sometimes she finds the minister, when she calls at :his house, looking, as she says, rather slovenly-by that we understand that he is not dressed for the pulpit or a wedding. So the report goes round that Mr. Plummer is a sloven. Sometimes she finds him holding the baby whilst his wife i's in another room en- gaged in some necessary avocation ; and then we hear that Mr. Plummer don't study -that his wife prevents him. Sometimes Mrs. Plummer and the children are the subjects of her remark for not being exactly in that trim in which   MSS BEMS.        Lo) she thinks they ought to be; and then we hear that Mr. Plummer ought to be ashamed of himself for not providing his wife with help, so that she iimay keep herself and family looking decent. She don't consider that our people only  give the minister but a little more than four hundred dol- lars a year, and that he finds it very difficult to get the necessaries of life. In this way you can easily see how much evil she may do. She thinks a minister ought never to say any thing only on the subject of religion, and ought always to be as solemn as if he were at a prayer meeting." "It is not at all surprising, if Miss Simons has any in- fluence, that she should occasion much trouble in a parish,"' Mrs. Whately observed. "As I said," Mrs. Durant replied, "there are some who are disposed to think considerable of Miss Simois; and then, you know, nowadays people don't stop to consider. If they hear any thing about a minister or his wife that is to their disadvantage, they are ready to believe it all true and to herald it forth far and near. Last fall oui, minis- ter, not having much for his horse to do, and being Willing to avail himself of the earnings of the animal, let him to a friend to go on a journey. As it was something unusual for the minister to be without a horse, Miss Simons con- jured up the idea that the horse arid minister's chaise had been taken for debt. This intelligence was spread about as a fact, both in and out of the parish, to the dis- credit of the minister. He came to know of the report by his being called upon one day by one of his friends to inquire of him if he wished to purchase a horse. The minister was surprised at the question, and remarked that he had one horse, and a very good one too, and did not' wish for another. '-Why,' said the friend, 'I thought you had no horse. I heard that you had been obliged to part with him. Miss Simons and some of her brothers have reported such a story, and I really thought it was a fact.   160     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. I supposed that you could not well do without a horse, and so I called to sell you mine.' The minister felt very much hurt by this species of intelligence; and, on inquiry, he traced it back to Miss Simons and her bachelor broth- ers. They did:not no w why the minister's horse was away; and being disposed to have a reason for all his con- duct, if they are not in possession of the true one, they will manufacture one to suit them." "These characters are really very vexatious and trouble- some," said Mrs. Davidson. "Yes, they are," replied Mrs. Durant.. "Our minister has lately been dismissed, you know; and the troublewith hinm all arose from this meddlesome Miss Simons and her brothers. She was at the bottom of it. They would re- port stories of no better foundation than the one I just told you about the minister's horse; and these were spread and believed, and a prejudice excited which resulted in the conviction on the part of many that it would be better forthe parish to have another minister:" "It is strange people will allow themselves to be influ- enced as they 'are in matters relating to a minister," Mrs. Davidson observed. "I cannot see why they should be- lieve every thing said to a  minister's disadvantage, as some are disposed to do. If all felt as I do, Miss Bemis and Miss Simons, and others like them, would have but small encouragement to pry into a minister's affairs and report the result of their officious meddliug among the parish." "I wish,'" said Mrs. Durant, "there were more like you, Mrs. Davidson, who can appreciate the peculiar situation of a  pastor and his family, and who have candor and com- mon sense to influence them in their judgment. If such were the case, there would be fewer difficulties in our patrishes." "I thank you, M Irs. Durant, for your good opinioni"   MSS BEMS.         161 Mrs. Davidson said, "and I hope I may ever have the character you give me. I cannot endure these persons who are forever making trouble in parishes with the min- ister." "I\ wish there was some way," said Mrs. Durant, "to prevent such characters as Miss Bemis from doing so much mischief."', "I wish so, too," said Mrs. Davidson, "with all my heart. The only way I think-of is, not to listen to them." "But then, you know, there are always to be found those who are disposed to give an ear to the gossip of a Miss Bemis, to swallow all her perversions, and wonder with her at all the fancied inconsistencies of ministers and their wives, and --" The sentence was not finished; for Miss Bemis was seen approaching the circle, and was soon seated near Mrs. Davidson and her friends. ".   CHAPTER     XIII.  .,. AN OLD PARISH DEBT. MR. ELDRIDGE had been out all the afternoon making pastoral calls, and returned home about the hour for tea in most excellent spirits, from the reflection upon the pros- perous condition of the parish and the many expressions of strong attachment of his people to their pastor. After removing his boots, and putting on slippers, and exchan- ging his coat for his study gown, he seated himself near his -wife, who was sewing by the window, and remarked,- "4 How I wish that old parish debt was paid I If that was only out of the way, I should be comparatively happy." " You can't bear debt, can you, husband?" his wife replied. "No, I cannot; and especially when there is not the least cause for it." "Why don't the people pay this debt?"Mrs. Eldridge inquired. "There are many who are very anxious to have it paid, and I suppose all would feel better if it were settled ; but, then, there is a difference in opinion as to the best way of paying it," Mr. Eldridge 'replied. "I should think a part of the fund might be taken for this purpose," Mrs. Eldridge suggested. "Some individuals wish to do thig," Mr. Eldridge said; "but there are more who think it would be the wiser way (162)   - AN OLD PARISH DEBT.  -   163 to have the debt paid by a tax. I have been thinking that I must bring up the subject in my next anniversary discourse, the time for preaching which is now near. It is eleven years since I have been here, and this debt has been the cause of no little vexation to-many of the parish and of trouble to me. I have conversed privately with different individuals upon the importance of having this matter adjusted until I have become, discouraged. I think, if I should lay myself out and preach a strong sermon upon the subject, something might be accomplished." "I do not know about this," said his wife, thoughtfully. 'It is a -delicate subject, and perhaps some might take ex- ceptions to your course, and the consequence might be a difficulty which might end in your dismission. "Well, what if it should?"Mr. Eldridge replied, with energy. "I cannot ielp it. This debt is a hinderance to the prosperity of the parish ; it has occasioned hard feel- ing at times among the people. It can be paid ; all would be glad if it were paid; and it must be paid. I rather think it is my duty to preach on the subject." In about a month from this period the anniversary. dis- course was preached, and was heard, too, by, all the large assembly. Seldom had the pastor equalled this pulpit effort, and never, perhaps, were the people more disposed to remark on a sermon. On the afternoon next after its delivery Mr. Eldridge was out calling on his people, and was surprised to discover what a deep impression his ser-- mon on the previous day had mdde. He was, moreover, highly gratified in hearing the importance of its subject so generally commended and in noticing how general wag the disposition to attack at once the old parish debt and annihilate it. In passing from one house on his way to another he met Mr. Osgood, whose conversion in the; early part of his ministry was alluded to in a previous chapter. Though somewhat bowed down with age, yet he ,     .   164     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. 'held on to his first love with enthusiastic ardor. Ever alive to what enters into the welfare of the church and success and happiness of the pastor, as soon as the com- mon salutations were over Mr. Osgood remarked, - "They say you preached a great discourse yesterday, Mr. Eldridge--a great discourse. I was glad to hear about it. I wish I had been to meeting; but I had to stay at home to let my wife go." "I noticed you were not present," the'pastor replied. "One of us," continued Mr. Osgood, " must stay at ' home with our poor sick daughter, you know; and I staid yesterday ; but I reckon I have heard about all you ,said. My wife told me a great deal; and then almost every one I have seen to-day hs been t talking about it. I rather guess they'll pay off the old debt now." "I hope they will, most certainly," said the pastor. "It ought to have been paid years ago." "Yes, yes; it ought," Mr. Osgood acquiesced; "but then, you know, the money was not wanted. The man who holds the note is satisfied to have the parish owe him, for he feels that his money is safe. Colonel Presbury likes to have his property secure, you know." "I had rather our parish would not be in debt," Mr. Eldridge continued, " as there is not the least reason for it. If Colonel Presbury don't want his money, he can easily invest it elsewhere. I don't like to have any one with whom I am connected in debt, Mr. Osgood." "I know," said the old gentleman, "'you don't like debt, Mr. Eldridge, and the people know it too; and they are all glad that you keep out of debt. You were just the man to preach such a sermon as you did yesterday. I guess you'll-make them pay the parish debt. If they do, they will all be glad of it; for they have been saying these twenty years or more that it ought to be paid." Passing on, Mr. Eldridge next called on widow Rich-   AN OLD PARISH DEBT.      165 ards, a very worthy member of his church, though in the humbler walks of life. She was a tenant of Col. Pres- bury, who lived in a large house near by. The pastor bad not long been seated before the good lady began about 'the sermon of yesterday, and observed, - "I was very glad to hear you preach about the parish debt, Mr. Eldridge. As long as the people are able to pay it off, I think they ought to do so." "Certainly," said the pastor; "and I trust they will shortly do so." "I rather think they will," Mrs. Richards replied. !"Colonel Presbury told me this morning, when I was in to pay my -quarter's rent, that he supposed the people would rally now and do something. The colonel was in favor of having it paid if the money was wanted ; but he said that was not the case. He said he did not want the money, and that it would do no harm to let the thing re- main as it now stands; but he said he supposed the people would pay it off." :-"Did he say how he thought it ought to be paid?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "He said that, if the people concluded to pay it, he thought the best way would be to use part of the fund; but he said he was afraid they would resort to taxation. That he would not like, you know. His tax would amount to something." "The colonel is able to pay a good tax," the pastor ob- served. "Where, the Lord gives property, there ought to be a disposition to do what is right. ' I hope the colonel will be ready to come in with the wishes of the majority. "But he won't, sir, if they make a tax. He willnever get over it. I know him well, for I have lived by the side of him these forty years. He loves his money, sir, better than any thing besides."  Finishing his visit here, the pastor directed his steps   166     A VOICE PFOM THE PARSONAGE. ,homeward. As he entered his house he heard busy con- versation in the parlor; and as he stood in the hall, lay. ing aside his hat, &c., he overheard the remark from one, "I was truly rejoiced to hear him 'preach so yesterday." And thus the pastor was made to know that his sermon of the day previous was the theme of conversation. He had scarcely been seated before Mrs. McKay observed, - "We have been talking about your ' debt sermon,' Mr. Eldridge." "Ah," said the pastor with a smile. "I have not heard that myt sermon had been named." "O0, yes, it has," said Mrs. Morrison; "I have heard a number of individuals to-day speak of Mr. Eldridge's debt sermon."   "Well, I hope none take exceptions to the discourse," the pastor said. "No- no, sir; it was a very popular discourse," Mrs. McKay remarked. "All liked it very much indeed. My husband thinks it will do good in more ways than one. He thinks it will not only be the means of paying the parish debt, but likewise of inducing sundry delinquent debtors about, who have almost exhausted the patience of their creditors, to consider of their obligations and at once 'square up.'" "Well," said Mrs. Cummings, a friend of Mrs. Morri- son from another town," if the sermon can have such an effect, I wish Mr. Eldridge might preach it to our people. We have some among us who need a little quickening upon the duty of paying their debts, particularly our deacon. He is very negligent in this respect, and has brought the office into great disrepute by not paying what he owes when it is in his power to do so. He can have every thing for himself and his children which is desired by either ; but when any of his creditors call they must be put off.' "That is a -sad caset" said Mr. Eldridge. "I should be   AN OLD PARtISt DEBT.      167 much tried if one of our deacons should have this char- acter." "Yes," said Mrs. Cummings; "I presume you would, Mr. Eldridge. Almost any minister, or, indeed, any indi- vidual, would be tried to have a deacon,owe almost every body when he practised no self-denial. Our deacon can have the best carriage in the parish, and can dress his children in the height of fashion; but he cannot pay his debts. He did not act. thus when his first wife was alive." "Well," said Mr. Eldridge, " if my sermon of yesterday answers a double purpose, as you intimate, Mrs. McKay, it will accomplish more than I designed. I shall indeed be highly gratified if it will be instrumental in rousing the parish to pay off its debt; and if delinquent debtors are ex- cited to do justly, so much the better." "I wonder our people have suffered this debt to remain so long," said Mrs. Morrison. "It has been standing more than fifty years- I am told." "You know," said Mrs. McKay, " the people have often tallied of paying it. No one has before taken up the matter in earnest, and commended the importance of hav- ing it cancelled, and got the public attention seriously turned towards the debt. I rather think now six months will not pass before the debt will be paid." "I hope they will make a tax to liquidate this debt," said Mrs. Morrison, " and not disturb the fund." "That would suit the greater part of the people best, I dare say," Mrs. McKay observed; " but some would be highly incensed should a tax be levied for this purpose." "Not many," Mrs. Morrison replied. "We were speak- ing on the subject at dinner to-day, and my husband said he did not believe there would be more than four or five who would be strenuous for taking any portion of the fund to settle this debt."'   168     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "Did he say who the four or five individuals were?" Mr. Eldridge inquired. "He mentioned Colonel Presbury, Mr. Benson, Mr. Otis," Mrs. Morrison said. "These gentlemen -have some influence," Mr. Eldridge ' observed, " and of course their feelings will be regarded." "I don't believe they can prevent the majority doing as they please, however," -said Mrs. Morrison, with much feeling. "I think there are a good many who would vote for a tax the sooner, if they thought Colonel Presbury and Mr. Benson were opposed to it." "That would be wrong, would it not?' said the pastor. "I suppose it would," Mrs. Morrison replied; "but hu- man nature will out with itself, you know, sometimes." "Yes," said the: pastor; " and the exhibition is often very odious, you know..- I really hope there are none among us who would vote for a tax merely to oppose the gentle- men who have been just' named." "Perhaps that would not, be, all the motive," said Mrs. Morrison. "I ',really hope, however, they will soon have a parish meeting and vote to pay off this old debt by a tax; for I think the prosperity of the parish would in this"way be best promoted." After their visitors had left, and as the pastor and his wife were alone, the latter remarked, "Your sermon yesterday will be remembered, I think, husband. There have been several ladies in this after- noon before those who have just gone came, who had a great deal to say about your preaching yesterday." "Who have been in, my dear?" "Mrs. Smith, bMrs. Barnes, Mrs. Thorndike, Miss Gill, Mrs. Lovell, -and Miss Bemis." "You have, indeed, been highly favored, I think. Did they all speak of the sermon?  "I believe they all did but Mrs. Barnes. She was taken ! f   AN OLD PARISH DEBT.      169 up in telling me about her sister, who lately died, you know. All the other ladies had much to say about the parish debt and your sermon." "What did Miss Bemis say about it?  "She called with Mrs. Lovell. Mrs. Lovell was de- lighted that you took up the subject and was highly pleased with your manner of treating it. Miss Bemis said that she was, but that she thought it would have been wiser to have preached it on a fast or thanksgiving occasion rather than on the Sabbath." "Of course," said Mr. Eldridge, dryly; "and if I had preached it on either of these days, it would have been wiser to have preached it at some other time ; or, if not; to have not preached at all. Well, wife, it is my opinion that all the people heard my sermon yesterday, land, as you say, that it will not-soon be forgotten. I never preached a sermon that I have heard so much about as I have of this. I met fifteen or twenty individuals whilst I was out this afternoon, and I believe every one of them had more or less to say about the parish debt'and my ser- mon yesterday. I think all this talk will lead to some action, and that soon the old parish debt will live only in memory." The ruling subject throughout the parish for several days continued to be the parish debt. The pastor was gratified to learn before the week- was out that there would be a warrant up on the next Sabbath for a parish meeting, " to see whether the parish will take any action in relation to the parish debt." The meeting was accords ingly held and most numerously attended by an interested company of voters and others. There seemed to be a general feeling that, all things considered, it would be for the interest of the parish if its debt was paid. When, however, the question came, How shall the debt be paid? there was more division! of sentiment. Mr.' Benson 15'  ! .    170'    A VOICE FROM STHE PARSONAGE, advanced the policy of paying the debt from the fund, Colonel Presbury sympathized in feeling with Mr. Benson and waxed warm in a speech on'the matter. Mr. Dixbn, a merchant of the place, sided in very warmly with the colonel. Against this policy there was very strong oppo- sition from a large number of individuals ; and when the motion to pay the debt from the fund was put, it was de- cided in, the negative by a very large majority. Mr. Clay then moved that the debt be paid With money raised by a tax; and after a long and very spirited debate the motion prevailed, there being not more than seven or eight out of some one hundred* and fifty voters whose hands were raised in opposition. Ini about two weeks from the period at which this parish meeting was held, somne six or seven gentlemen called on the pastor. Sqtuire Davidson, Mr. Morrison, Mr. Clay, and Deacon' Smithe were of the number. They proved to be a delegation from a large portion of Mr. Eldridge's parish to convey to him some expiressions ofgratitude for his agency in the matter of liquidating the parish debt. The squire was appointed to take the lead in the premises; and he acquitted himself, as few could .have done, well, and handsomely. In his address he touched upon many things in the history of the pastor which could not have failed to produce in the breast df that worthy man the most .pleas- urable emotions. In closing, the squire remarked, "For your interest in this important matter, reverend sir, your- friends, which appear to be almost the ientire people, have raised the slim Of one hundred dollarsl which I now have the happiness of tendering to you." As such a delegation for such a purpose had not, in any breeze nor by any tongue, been initimated to the pastor, he was taken by storm, and for a moment utterance failed him in his at- tempts to conquer the tempest of feeling which was raging within him. However, but a -moment thus bound the   AN OLD PARISH DIkBT, gratitude of his heart; for'he soon spoke forth manly sen- timents, grateful words, thanking heartily his people for their abiding interest in himself. He was particularly grateful for the evidence borne by the presents interview with their delegation, of the unanimous satisfactioniexpe- rienced in the parish at the extinguishment of the debt which had troubled him so much, and been no inconsider- able source of disquietude, at times, in the parish. Whether the few opposed to the tax were aware of this expression of feeling in the many, none could then tell. That one of these few laid the tax heavily to heart, think. ing of it by night and meditating on it by day, thus allow- ing it corroding power for years before its development to the world, may appear by and by.   CH  PTER  XIV. RE DAVIDSON A DELEGATE TO A COUNCIL. "ARE YOU any acquainted with Mr. Hanly, father, or any of his people?" asked Frances of Squirg Davidson. "I believe I met him once, daughter, at a council some- where; but I do not now remember where; I do not know as I am acquainted with any of his people." "I thought such, might be the case. as in the letter miso sive it was requested that you might be appointed dele- gate from our church to the council for his dismission." "I presume some of the people or Mr. Hanly may know something of me, as I have been onl a large number of councils, you know," the father continued. "I am afraid that I shall be under the necessity of going alone, as Mr. Eldridge will probably think it his duty to remain at home."  "What is the matter, husband, that Mr. Eldridge can- not go?"  I saw him this morning," said the squire", "and he told me that he felt afraid his little Henry was going to be sick, and that, if he were no better in the morning, he should not go to the council." "I am sorry to hear that he has mori sickness in his family," Mrs. Davidson-said. "I hope the dear little boy will not be sick." Early the next morning Mr. Eldridge called on the   SQUIRE DAVIDSON A DELEGATE TO A COUNCIL. 173 squire and informed him that the illness of his son had increased, and consequently that it would not be consis- tent for him to leave town.  "What need is there of your going, husband?"Mrs. Davidson inquired, after Mr. Eldridge had left. "As the distance is great and the people are strangers to you, I would not go. I don't see why they sent so far for a council. It is upwards of fifty miles from here, is it not?" "Yes, dear," the husband replied; "it is upwards of sixty, I believe. As Mr. Hanly and his church have sent to our chifrch, and as I have been chosen a delegate, I feel that I ought to go; and I must start this afternoon, too, by one o'clock, or I shall not be there to-morrow in season."         The squire accordingly set off; and 'the next day, after a long ride in his own carriage, he found himself with others in council for the dismission of Mr. Hanly. This ecclesiastical body he soon discovered was composed of pastors and delegates of no ordinary discernment, wis- dom, and piety; and the squire felt himself happy in the reflection on their capacity to act as valuable advisers in the case now before them. It appeared froa the documents submitted that Mr. Hanly had been settled about six years, and had been sin- gularly blessed in his labors for the conversion of the im- penitent and for the general welfare of his people. His efforts for the younger portion of his flock had been blessed to. the advancement of this important part of his charge in every thing which tended to their increased promise and worth. It appeared, likewise, that Mr. Han- ly had a young and rising family about him, and that he was not apprised of there being any necessity for his seeking another parish .until, about three months anterior to the session of this council. Indeed, he almost felt as- sured, from the many:-expressions, not only from leading 15     174     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. individuals, in his society, but from all -classes therein, which had been repeated. almost every month, that he oc- cupied a deep place in the confidence and affections of his people, and that it would be no easy task to create ani- mosity and alienation towards him.. Being a young man and enthusiastic in his love for his chosen profession, he was not looking for any interruption to his usefulness, whilst he was increasing in his efforts and power to ren- der unto his people more and more service. He so read that word of eternal truth -the unfolding of which to his fellow-men was' the great object -of his life -as to draw 'therefrom the inference, at no. infrequent intervals and in no measured strength, that, if he was true to his God and to the entire people of his charge, he had reasonable ground for the expectation that his people would be true to him. It was, accordingly, his. constant endeavor to be thus true; nor did any evidence in the slightest form ap- pear in all that was said by the people before the council that their pastor had deviated from the general line of true ministerial fidelity. It became, therefore, rather a difficult enigma for the council to solve how the useful- ness of the pastor was over with the people of his charge when it was universally admitted that he had labored faithfully, both in and out of the pulpit, during the entire period of his ministry, and that he was generally respected and beloved throughout the society. In the solution of this enigma the pastor and a few others could at once have rendered important aid; but, inasmuch as the council had been called to consider all matters superin- ducing the necessity of the pastor's dismission, he and others deemed it proper for a time to stand in the rear, to allow the individuals who had been prominent in the creation of this necessity to make out their case and illus- trate their general reason that Mr, Hanly had lost his use! fulness. 'At almost every step made by the opposition to   SQUIRE DAVIDSON A DELEGATE TO A COUNCIL, 1 the pastor it was evident that they were embarrassed with the lameness of their cause; and not unfrequently 'Was there a strange irritation about the bronchial region at some question from one member -of the council and an- other, which for a moment so choked the utterance of the  respondents as to make it rather difficult for them to pro- ceed. However, after' three or four hours had been con- sumed in making out their case, the committee announced to the council that they had nothing more to offer. As the hour was near at which the council had voted to adjourn for tea, it was voted that the pastor and his-friends defer their statements to the evening session. , At the evening session the pastor addressed the council in a few sentences, which breathed so much self-possession, candor, reliance on rectitude of motive, a clear conscience, and of general trust in God and in-the impartial trust in' the judgment of the wise and good, that they -made most hlppy impressions on all who were present. He closed by saying that he would proceed to call a few witnesses, from whose testimony he had no doubt the council would soon discover--if he had lost his influence, and conse- quently his usefulness among the people of his charge- in what way this disastrous result had been accomplished. He accordingly first called the name of a very prominent member of the parish, who had influence over many by his- extensive wealth, and- asked him if he would have the goodness to come forward. This was a course which had not been antiqipated. As the gentleman thus summoned had been taken by surprise, he was not very prompt in his movements towards the table of the scribe, where he was requested by the moderator to appear. However, at last he made his way- through the crowd and stood at the table, by the side of which Mr, Hanly had his seat. The pastor then said, "I would ask you, Mr. Wilcox, when opposition to the pastor, to your knowledge, was first manifested?"   176     A VOICE FPROM THE PARSONAGE. "I never heard of any opposition to speak of until last December," was the reply. V "If there had been any before that period you would  probably have known it, would you not, sir?  "I think I should," was the answer. "Is it your opinion that the usefulness of the pastor in this church and society is at an end?" "I have thought so for some time past ; yes, sir." ' What has the pastor done to destroy'his usefulness?"  "He'm-he'm well, I don't know as I can exactly say y" "If the pastor has lost his influence, Mr. Wilcox, he must have done this by some act or acts. Either he has committed some offence or omitted some important duties. Now, I would like to have you state to the council if the pastor has been negligent of any ministerial duty, or been guilty of any conduct which ought to have destroyed his usefulness." , The gentleman hesitating and changing his positions evidently betraying an inability to answer, Mr. Hanly varied his question by asking,- "Has' it been supposed that the pastor, within the last ten months or previously, has neglected his studies, or neglected his people, or been guilty of any species of im- proper conduct?" "I have never heard any thing said that has led me to suppose that the pastor was negligent of his studies or that he did not take proper care of his people. No one, to my knowledge, has ever said that you have committed any crime." "Well, Mr. Wilcox, I will ask you one other question. If the pastor had been in Europe throughout the last No- vember, do you think there would have blen any com- plaint that his usefulness was lost?" "I do not know as he lost his influence in the month of November last.    SQUIRE DAVIDSON A DELEGATE TO A COUNCIL. 1 "Well, sir, did your pastor vote for governor and for president lastlNovember?"  "He!m - he'n," with a sudden reddening of the face. Mr. Wilcox finally remarked, "I believe that he did, sir. It is generally supposed that he did." "( Well, sir, have you heard that any of our people were dissatisfied with the manner of his voting?" "I have heard something of the kind, sir." "There was considerable political excitement in this town, was there not, sir?" "There was."  "Did you ever know of -the pastor's taking any active part in political matters, or that he was disposed to make the subject a matter of conversation when visiting the people?" "I never heard much said about the matter," . "Have you heard any of the:party with-whom tde pastor was supposed to vote complain -of him for voting?"  "Not that I know of." "Did the pastor vote the same ticket with yourself?" "I suppose he did not.1" "Have you heard any thing said by your party about the pastor's voting?" "Yes, sir; I have." "Have you heard more from your party than from any other?" "I suppose that I have, sir." The moderator inquired if the pastor voted with the party that was the largest in his parish. "He is supposed," Mr. Wilcox replied, "t to have voted with the party which is the largest in the town, but not in our parish, sir." A member of the council inquired, "Had the pastor voted with the party which was the   178    A VOICE PFROM THE PARSONAGE. largest in his own society, would there, in your opinion, have been the opposition to him which now exists?" The gentleman not answering at once, the member pro- posing the interrogatory remarked that he would not press the question. Whereupon Mr. Hanly said he had no further questions to ask-Mr. Wilcox; -and the witness retired. Mr. Hanly next called on Mr. Goodwin, who, appearing at the stand, was asked, - "Will you please to state to the council, Mr. Goodwin, your views of the present state of feeling in our church and parish in relation to the pastor?" "I don't know as I have any thing in particular to offer," the gentleman remarked. I "There appears to be considerable bad feeling at the present time. Many think it is time to have another minister." "How' long has the dissatisfaction of which you speak been manifest?" "I never heard of any alienation towards the pastor till. within, a few months. The people until lately all thought a great deal of the minister; but, somehow or other, there does not appear- so much interest in him now as formerly." "Have you heard any charges brought against the pas- tor for neglect of duty or improper conduct?" "I do not remember to haVe heard of any such." "Do you think that the present difficulties with the pas- tor are in any way connected with the exercise of his political rights?" "Well, sir, to be frank, I am free to say, if you had voted last fall a certain ticket, those who are now op- posed to you would not have acted as they have,"  "I have no further questions," Mr. Hanly observed. As Mr. Goodwin was retiring, a member of the council inquired, -   2I! " .SQUIRE DAVIDSON A DELEGATE TO A COUNCIL.    17 "Did the pastor vote as you voted, Mr. Goodwin?" "He did not, sir, I believe. I wish that/ he had. I think it would have been vastly better for him if he had voted right:" Squire Davidson inquired,- "Who has decided that the pastor voted wrong?" Mr. Goodwin smiled, and retired in 'the midst of a gentle laugh of the council and of all the spectators. The testimony of many other-individuals was given, and was much ia accordance with the foregoing evidence. It came out, however, from one of the witnesses, that, in contracting a second marriage, the pastor had not paid suf- ficient deference to the suggestions of JMr. Wcikox's family, whose desires had been excited that a niece of theirs might be the wife of their pastor. There was no testimony in- troduced which in any form reflected- on the character of Mr. Hanly. He was shown to be a faithful, studious, la- borious, efficient, consistent, and successful minister. In- cidentally, as well as directly, it appeared that no clergy- man among the many with whom Mr. Hanly exchanged was as acceptable to the people as himself, and that before that "fatal vote," and perhaps that " unfortunate election " of a wife, in utter disregard of the wishes of those who arrogated to themselves the dictatorship over their minis- ter, he had a firm place in the affections of all.- Nor could any mistake, from the entire disclosures which were made, what was the true and real ground for the termina- tion of the pastor's usefulness among his people. This loss of influence was not owing to the warm opposition of the entire political party in Mr. Hanly's society with which he was not in sympathy. The real cause appeared to be, that there were a few in the party who thought no consideration second to that of their own kind of politics, and whose care for its success was their religion; whose zeal for this success was so great as to make them ready    180     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. to annihilate all opposition, even if the destruction of pri- vate character, or happiness, or prosperity were the con- sequence of their conduct. Mr. Wilcox was a rich man, a man of many farms, of many manufacturing works, and there were many under him. He could say to one, Go, and he goeth; to another, Come, and he cometh ; to another, Vote, and he voteth. The society of which Mr. Hanly was pastor had grown up under the auspices of the Wilcox family till it became an independent body and abje to provide for its own interests. Whilst many were for do- ing this, and thus retain their pastor, others of the same political party with Mr. Wilcox, though not condemning the minister for voting as it seemed to him good,- a pre- rogative which they claimed for themselves, and which they were willing every freeman should enjoy,--yet thought it 'might be best, for the sake of peace in the parish, that he should leave. It appeared that all the opposition to the pastor began with one or two individuals, as before stated, and that they had variously labored to increase dissatisfaction and provoke to their way of thinking, until at last, from prudential and politic considerations on the part of some, themselves willing that Mr. Hanly be re- tained, a state of feeling existed which would oppose the pastor's usefulness and happiness. This was the view taken by the council of the whole matter in their secret session for deliberation and result. This they formally declared on the morning of the second day of their sitting. From the feeling which had been developed, it was their opinion that the pastor could no longer be useful unless there was a change in this feeling. Taking it for granted that there would be no change, they advised the dismission of Mr. Hanly. In doing this, the council said all in his praise which a pastor in his situation could desire. They likewise admonished the people kindly but faithfully. The great sin of destroying a pastor's usefulness, when he   SQUIRE DAVIDSON A DELEGATE TO A COUNCIL. 181 had in an eminent degree demonstrated his fitness for the station to which they had called him, merely for exercis- ing his immunities as a man and a citizen, was set forth in no very measured terms. The rights of a pastor-his civil, political, social, and religious rights-were well de- fined and ably defended. The assumption of any to a dictatorship over him was severely condemned. "No people," said the council in their result, -"-no people nor individuals in a parish ought ever to question, or do any thing to embarrass, a pastor in the exercise of all the rights which belong to him as a man and as a member of the community. His political and social rights are no more to be controlled by his people than are theirs to be by him."  In shaping -this result, and in the rebukes which were faithfully administered tow the few who had labored in all ways to effect the removal of Mr. Hanly, perhaps no indi- vidual had more influence than Squire Davidson. To his large and comprehensive mind, his generous and- expansive heart, every act of a people towards their pastor which tended in the least to impair his personal rights or dimin. ish his happiness would 4tave no other appearance but that of evil. Consequently, every utterance from him would be condemnatory, and every expression a severe though deserved rebuke. "A minister is a man,' he would often say; "let him live as a man, be treated as a man, enjoy as a man, with every help'from his people to smooth his path; for, after all, his situation has so much that is trying about it he can enjoy but little this side of heaven." 16         .    CHAPTER XV. AN INCIDENT AT AN ASSOCIATION. EVERY clergyman in New England, and, indeed, through- out our country, is in connection ith some association which Aas for its object ministerial progress. To such an association Mr. Eldridge was attached. Whilst its meet- ings are for the general improvement of the mind and heart, and for opportunities in which counsel can be ,ob- tained by its members either on matters of a parochial or of a personal character, yet the study of the Greek and Hebrew, the critical reading of sermons or, literary or theological dissertations, does not occupy the mninds -of those present from the opening to the adjournment of the association, or presbytery. Having in general the same object in life, there is sympathy in its members one with another ; and when, therefore, they come together, as they do at infrequent intervals, it is to be supposed that there will be some expressions other than what are strictly lit- erary or theological. It would be strange if the opportu- nity were not improved for general relaxation and the diversion of the mind from its severer exercises in the performance of the arduous and often perplexing and try- ing duties of the pastorship. The recess had for dinner or tea is very often the opportunity which is improved for this purpose. As a few members of the association with which Mr. (182)   1        AN INCIDENT AT AN ASSOCIATION.    183 Eldridge was connected were standing, after dinner, under a large elm tree that spread its many branches over h]is house, a remark was made, in a somewhat loud utterance, that arrested the attention of another circle which stood near the door. So one of this latter circle, to satisfy the curiosity which was awakened, not only in his own mind, Ii  but in the minds of others about him, observed to the brother under the tree who made the :remark,-- "What is that, brother Martin, you just said?" "O," said brother Martin, "we have been discussing here since dinner the subject of pastoral security; and I remarked that I did not believe there was a pastor in the commonwealth who was at ease on his saddle." "That is rather a random shot, is it not?" inquired the brother for whose gratification the remark was repeated. "Of course it is," Mr. Martin replied; "I intended it as such - to hit every way." ' "Well ,'I cannot agree with you," said Mr. Ellis, the brother before alluded to. By this time pretty much all the brethren had been at- tracted towards the tree and were together under its shade. Said brother Martin,- "I perceive we have about all the members of the asso- -ciation here ; and I move the question be put to each one as to his own views and feelings of the permanency of his relation to his people. I think the response would be a- very fair illustration and representation of the position of all the pastors in the state." Without waiting for the formality of a vote upon his motion, Mr. Martin at once asked the brother nearest him for his expression. "I don't know about this," brother Parker said; "but I very often tell my wife, when I plant my garden in the spring, that I do not know who will have the fruits thereof in the autumn. There is nothing now   very alarming'   184     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. among my people; but as for feeling secure for even a year, that is altogether out of the question. I have felt that I might be dismissed almost any time." "Brother Taylor, how is it with you?" "As yet I have not had any great fears about going" Mr. Taylor said. "You all know that our people have run largely into debt in building their meeting house. They think they have quite a burden to carry, and don't trouble themselves about me much. Besides, my people feel that I am a business sort of a mnan, and are relying on me to financier for them and help them. If they were not em- barrassed and were going on smoothly, I should feel that I might find myself suddenly so situated as to make it for my comfort to-seek another parish." "Well, father Stowe, will you have the goodness to favor us with your experience in relation to this matter?" "As I have now weathered it for upwards of thirty years among my present people, I do not know as I have any very particular fears of being dismissed. My people would be rather mortified to turn me off in my old age after I have endured the battle so long. I presume, how- ever, many of them would have no objection if I was in heaven. If I had not been with them for such a length of time, I have no doubt-there would have been a movement within a few years past in relation to another pastor. I hear now occasionally that some of the young folks are talking about a colleague for me." "Brother Sandford, how is it with you?" "If I had not been blessed with the means of living without my people, I should have been routed two or three times within the last ten years. I almost know that I should not have been where I am at present if I had been depend- ent on my people. They know I can live without them; and I suppose they are rather proud of the fact. If the salary now is not promptly paid, they are not much troubled   AN INCIDENT AT AN ASSOCIATION.   -185 by the delinquency. If I were poor, they would be under the necessity of being punctual." "Brother Haven, what can we hear from you?" "I feel pretty much with brother Parker, that, when I set out a tree in my garden, I am by no means sure that, if I live, I shall see its first blossom., I am fully of the opinion that there are but few, if any, who are at ease on their saddle, as the brother said." In this manner was each member of the association ques- tioned ; and it appeared that there was not an individual member who felt that he had any hold of his people which would survive the resolute effort of a few to put asunder the pastoral relation. All confessed"to a continued anxie- ty as to a rupture ; and, on the whole, it was very generally conceded that the brother whose remark at the onset was deemed by some as too broad had only related a truth, which the experience' of the brethren fully confirmed. "This is really a melancholy state of things,"- Mr. Parker observed, " for the pastors of our churches to be thus disturbed with anxiety as to the permanency of their continuance among their people." "It is truly," acquiesced Mr. Martin, " a very great evil, not only to pastors, but likewise to churches. I have no doubt this conscious insecurity of pastors subtracts from their usefulness at least twenty per cent. They are now on the watch, and are sensitive to every passing breeze, not knowing but a storm may be gathering. Considera- ble time is consumed in watching events and in calculating probabilities ; and with some pastors there is that feverish excitement which greatly impairs efficient action." "This may be all true of some of our brethren who are very nervous and sensitive," said Mr. Selden; "but I rather think there are some who do not spend much time in borrowing trouble." "I think," continued brbther Martin, " that Mr. Selden 16    186     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGI. is not exactly a competent judge in the present matter. Very few men have your nerve, brother Selden; very few can stand up as you can in times of trouble. You have just now stated that every one or two years there was quite a stir among your people in relation to your removal, and that you 'would have been dismissed long since had not your people been afraid of you. Now, supposing I had been in your situation; don't you think I should have been so much oppressed with what I might hav;e heard as would have essentially hindered my usefulness?" "It is not best to be chicken hearted," Mr. Selden replied. "But I cannot think it is chicken heartedness," said brother Sandford. "This anxiety is almost inseparable from humanity. I agree with brother Martin, that you are not a proper judge in the premises. Very few men have your nerve.' "I would like to inquire of brother Selden," said Mr. Eldridge, " if the excitement among his people from time to time in relation to his removals has not occupied much of his time, if it has not depressed his spirits?" "O, yes," said brother Selden ; " it has cost me many hours, I dare say, to think over matters and to prepare to meet events." "If your thoughts had not been engrossed with prepa- ration to meet the obstacles to your ministry which accu- mulated under the operation of the uneasiness of some of your people, you would have been occupied in doing some- thing directly for their benefit, would you not?"Mr. Mar- tin inquired. "Very likely, brother." "Your own admissions," said Mr. Eldridge, "prove that the disposition on the part of your people to disturb for trifling causes is very hurtful both to the pastor and to them. I suppose all the trouble in your parish has been   AN INCIDENT AT AN ASSOCIATION.    187 from fanciful rather than from real causes. No charges are brought against you to affect your character in tle least, either as a preacher, pastor, or a man. From what I am able to gather, your people acknowledge that there is no preacher in the association who is superior to you, and that the attempts made to displace you have pro- ceeded from a few, who hardly know what kind of a min- ister would please them. , These wish for frequent changes merely to gratify a sort of capricious feeling. Though you have not been cast down when these individuals have been agitating, there are not many, if there be any, of us who would have stood up. We should have felt our use- fulness to be at an end in such a fire and racket." "It is very strange," father Stowe remarked, "that our churches, and parishes do. not realize the vast injury they are doing themselves when exercised with this restless spirit of which we have been speaking. -Take brother Selden's case for illustration. He has been settled about twelve years; and for some time past,-as often, I should think, as every other year, I have heard of trouble there. The great body of his people have been satisfied with him, and are now, I preskume -; but how much injury indirectly have they received when in these fomenting states I They could not listen to preaching with any profit, for their minds were disquieted. Nor could they maintain that spirit of earnest prayer for the revival of God's work among them which is indispensable to a successful ministry of the word. If our churches would feel that the pastor they have is God's servant and gift, and that they are. under the high- est obligations to derive the greatest good from his minis- try,-if they would not suffer themselves to think that there was a possibility of his being taken away from them except by death, -I think there would be both better preachers and better Christians than there are now. In'a great many parishes nowadcays the people are pretty much   188     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. all the time either hearing candidates, or settling a minis- ter, or quarrelling one away. Now, what effect has the word preached among such a people?" "Brethren," said Mr. Ayers, "I think we ministers must take some of the responsibility for this restless spirit be- ing in our churches ; for some of us, at least, encourage it. There are, you know, ministerial lawyers whom these restless spirits in our churches consult, and by whom they are often indirectly, and many times directly, aided in their attempts at disorganization. It is pleasant to poor hu- man nature to be flattered and be had in high estimation for our wisdom; but I do not think it right for a minister, for a pastor, to take up against his brother pastor, and be a sort of semi-lawyer for these people in our churches who are forever making difficulty." Here the colloquy was interrupted by the arrival of the hour for the afternoon session of the association.   C CHAPTER    XVI. i'JJ,         AN EVENING IN BOSTON. IN the prosecution' of his mercantile pursuits in the country, it was necessary that Squire Davidson should frequently visit the city. At the period of one of these visits the legislature was in session; and as Mr. Adams, the representative from his town, was one of his particular friends and a member of the same church with himself, he availed himself of his earliest leisure to call at the State House and seek an interview with his friend. The squire was not designing any protracted stop in the lobby, but only to acquaint his friend with the fact of his being in the city, with the expectation of calling upon him again at his hotel. After a brief interview, made briefer than was anticipated by the fact that the house was about passing to be engrossed a bill which had long been before the body and which had awakened strong feeling and elicited lengthy debate, the squire took his leave, accept- ing, however, an invitation from the representative to call upon him again at the Bromfield House. There being several members of the legislature in whose acquaintance Mr. Adams had found great pleasure, he invited them likewise; for he felt assured that their acquaintance with the squire would on every account be an increased source of their pleasure as well as a great gratification to (189)   190     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGEo him. When, therefore, the company were together in the evening, it was found that eleven individuals, representing different portions of the state and various professions, were happy in each other's society. For a while their conversation was on general subjects; and it was some. what remarkable that most of the gentlemen discovered a similarity of tastes and feelings, which contributed to enhance in no small degree their enjoyment. At length one of the gentlemen inquired of Mr. Adams who he 'thought would be chosen election preacher, as the morrow was the period assigned for the choice. This question brought up the subject of ministers; and as the company -were chiefly professors of religion, they soon 'evinced their interest in this important class of the community. No subject more interested the squire, as his sympathies had for a long period, and in a remarkable manner, been with the mehn who were so conspicuous to every eye and so often the subject of remark from almost every todngue. All noticed his eager' interest, and all- were delighted with therzeal in which he expressed himself in relation to the men whose position was so peculiar and trying. At length Mr. Davis, of Boston, observed,- "I wonder sometimes tfow any young man dare enter the ministry." "How so?" inquired Mr. Adams. "The situation of a clergyman is so uncertain, per- plexing, and trying as to present but few inducements to become a minister," Mr. Davis replied. "Ah, well," said the squire, " the reward is to come. A faithful minister will have no low place in heaven nor small enjoyment there." "That is about all the inducement that I can see," said Mr. Davis, "to dispose any man to be a minister. There is much in this consideration, I acknowledge,  The reflec-   AN E-VmNttI  IN 'BOSTON.     191 tion must be pleasant, that, by entering the ministry-and continuing faithful therein, an individual will be the ins strument in saving souls and preparing them for heaven." "That is the greatest motive," said Mr. Adams, " to the young man who makes choice of the clerical profession." "A man must have strong-faith and but little care for the things of this world," Mr. Davis observed, " who-de- cides to become a minister." "It is high time, I think, 'remarked Mr. Talbot, ' that a different feeling prevailed in -the community in relation to the ministry. It seems to me, when I see and hear how ministers are treated, that there is but little humanity in the consideration of them. Often when they are-taXing all their physical and intellectual power for the advan- tage- of the people, and when they are really accomplishing vast benefits for them, not onlyfor time but for eternity; how sadly are they traduced and how suddenly their ;use- fulness arrested I This, is done, too, without the show of reason, and only to gratify pride, or caprice, or some more criminal feeling. The effects of such conduct on the happiness of the pastor and family are at times painful in the extreme." "That is all true," replied Mr. Davis; " and it was be- cause a minister is so very insecure in his relations to his people that I remarked just now as I did, wondering how any young man could consent to become aminister. A clergyman can make no calculation-ahead. He has no foundation for hope, if he be faithfulfin the discharge of his duties to his people, that they willcherish him in their affections and sustain him in their service. Any trifling cause may set him afloat."         ' "From your expressions, Mr. Davis, I should judge," said the squire, "that you were familiar with the vicissi- tudes of the pastoral office in our country towns. I have supposed that your city ministers were regarded with   192    A VOICE FROM TlE PARSONAGE. much more consideration than the clergy are in the coun try by their people. Instances Gof the dismission of pastors in the city &re not very common, I believe." "We intend;, of course," Mr. Davis replied, "to be -,reasonable and just towards our ministers, but perhaps fi/^!a this respect as often as you do in the country. 'ii;s there is ,something in the circumstances of a city population which tends to the greater permanency of the pastoral relation over that which exists in the country." ' It do not know,' the squire observed, as I understand whbIeTin the circumstances of the city people differ from thbspe:bof the country in this respect." u We, have, you know, a variety of churches with us; and if any individuals become dissatisfied with their pastor, it is a very easy thing for them to leave and go to another church., 4"There is something in this consideration," said the squire . "It never occurred to me before. I can under- stand now ow a pastor in the city may remain' settled in rthe same, chih:h ffar years." ".Our population," continued-Mr. Davis, " is made up to a large extent of those who formerly lived in the country and have: not that strength of attachment to locality which exists with yon. In the country people think much of, thejir church..:. All their early and strong associations are with it. There worshipp:4d their fathers- there they were, wont to go-from, early, hildhood to maturet years --there they have formed a strengthened their strongest friendships, A thousand considerations bind the people in the country to their own sanctuary and make them indis- posed to leave them for athe her, were such an alternative praticable, which you know is not often the case. J If a parishioner in the country becomes dissatisfied with his pastor, he must either absent himself from church and remain at home, or ride every Sabbath much of a distance    AN EVEXING IN BOSTON.       WQ to another town for worship, or make an effort to effects: the removal of his pastor. This latter course is most usually pursued; and it is for this reason, I apprehend, that dismissions in the country are more frequent than in the city. When we are dissatisfied, it is the easiest thing to change our place of worship for the enjoyment 'of a more welcome minister."           : -. . "Your people in the city," said the squire, " virtually change ministers very oftea." "Exactly so," said Mr. Davis. "Some congregations so change in course of a few years that very few -of the people who were prominent in the settlement of the pastor are to be found in them. Some move out of the city, some go to other churches, sometimes because they are better pleased with another clergyman than their own, and at other times because in changing their place of resi- dence they are remotely situated from the sanctuary where they have been accustomed to worship. I have no doubt there are pastors here who will say that their congrega- tions have changed almost entirely within the last six or eight years. I know of some individuals who have be- longed to two or three churches within this period." "There might be added another- reason," Mr. Allen suggested, "why the pastoral relation is less frequently sundered 'in the city than it is in the country; and that is, city ministers are less watched. In, the country, you know, a clergyman cannot move without half a dozen or more are observing him. His whole daily conduct as well as that of his family is liable to be known and remarked upon all over the parish." "A clergyman should do nothiing,",Mr. Marvin said, "which should be to his disadvantage were it made public." "You know, sir," the squire quickly remarked, " people sometimes but partly see, and then speak of a thing as if 17            -   194     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGEo it had been fully observed. I know there are many people who are much disposed to talk about ministers, and these gather materials for their gossip from their observations of them as they go out and come in. They often manu- facture a large story out of a circumstance which was but partly seen by them. They thought they saw what they reported; but from an examination into the- facts, which became, necessary from the commotion which had been excited, it appeared that the individual who started the story but imperfectly saw, and his imagination supplied the place of perfect vision."- ".That is it," Mr. Allen observed. "In the country the tongue must go as well as in the city; but the causes to excite its motion are less variable in the former. So the people must make the best use of the materials for gossip which they have. The minister is a prominent man; he is lublic property; and so he is made, unfortunate man, the subject of daily and common remark. Mrs. A  , a niear neighbor, sees him ride away from home in the morning. Soon Mrs. B   calls on Mrs. A  and pres- ently asks where the minister is gone, for she saw him ride by their house. 'O,' says Mrs. A ,' I don't know where he goes; he seems to be going somewhere all the time.' In this way the mill often starts in the country, and before the gate is shut quite a grist is ground. Now, the changing scenes of the city continually give rise to varied subjects of engrossing thought and remark, and the minister thus escapes. Besides, people in the city are full of business and have no time to watch their neigh- bors; and, if they had this time, there are too many of them, so that the minister would of necessity be passed by to a great extent." "I trust," said the-squire, "our friend Allen does not charge to the ladies the entire responsibility of the mis- chief done to our country ministers by the tongue.":   r '"l,'-:!:      AX' EVENING IN BOSTON.      195 "Far from it," Mr. Allen replied. "I am not one who supposes that gentlemen cannot and do not indulge them- selves in watching the movements of ministers and in reporting the result of their observations.- I have seen too many a Paul Pry in my day, who have directed their scrutinizing glance at their minister so effectually as to imagine they were perfectly acquainted with his ways, not to believe that the gentlemen are as much, if not more, in fault than the ladies. I think they hoist the gte quite as frequently as the -ladies."  i You have sufficiently acquitted yourself of the charge, Mr. Allen," the squire replied. "Were there any ladies present, I presume they would be satisfied." ' I should hope so," said Mr. Allen; "for I should be very unwilling to make them exclusively responsible for the indulgence of that idle curiosity over a minister and his affairs from which so many evils have originated in our country parishes and have fallen so disastrously on ministers."  "I have no doubt," Mr. Talbot observed, "that the cause assigned by Mr. Allen for the greater permanency of the pastoral relation in the city than in the country is true. My own observation -confirms me in this opinion. People must talk, and consequently they must have -some- thing to talk about; and the minister is about as fruitful a subject as can -be found in the country. I regret that it is so; but we must admit the fact, there is a disposition to talk about a pastor to his discredit. I will not affirm that all who say improper things about him :always de- sign to do him any injury ; but, then, what is thus spoken seldom fails to produce this effect. A minister in the country is pretty narrowly watched; for he is a very prominent man there. In the city this is not so much the case. There are individuals here, and a large number of them too, as prominent as the minister, and perhaps more    196     A VOICE FRtOM THE PARSONAGE. so. The city minister, therefore, is not alone viewed from an eminence. Were I a country minister, I should wish to live remote from neighbors. I would have a house, if I could by any means obtain one, in a secluded spot, so that it would not be known what was going on about my premises. Lately I visited a relative of my wife, who is a clergyman. I found him in an unhappy condition. There was trouble in his parish. To my .inquiry, 'What occa- sioned this trouble? ' he took me to his window and asked Dme to look up tq, a hlouse opposite to his own, on a rising eminence, from which his premises are easily seen, and, directing my eye to a particular window, remarked, 'There! that window has made all this disturbance.' I learned that neither the pastor, nor any of his family, nor a stranger -could go in or come out, nor a carriage be driven up to his door, without there being generally at 'that window' one or more individuals to watch. And what they actually saw and what they thought they wit- nessed was sure to be a subject of remark all over the parish within four and twenty hours; for they who lived in that house were very fond of telling the news, and gos- sip was their chief delight. No"w these people had re- ported things which they fancied they saw in relation to the minister, and others had added a little, till there was considerable of a fire -kindled in the parish. I advised my friend to sfll his place and move into the woods, or else into the city, where he- could escape such searching eyes and those prattling tongues." "I most fully believe that all this is true," said Squire Davidson. "A man's neighbors in the country often do him great harm, and a minister is oftentimes more harmed in this manner than other .people. I have always deemed it of the first importance that our pastor should have a house in a neighborhood of consistent and reasonable people; for I have felt that if he should have a certain   class of neighbors his usefulness, his happiness and his respectability might be very materially affected and in- jured. I have known of great difficulties in parishes which have resulted in the dismission of their pastors, be- ing commenced bly the unwise, uncharitable, and unrea- sonable course pursued by the minister's neighbors. With- out being aware, often, of the mischief their remarks are fitted to produce, they indulge themselves in idle gossip, of which people in other parts of the parish take hold, and thus persons evil disposed towards a pastor are fur- nished with materials- for doing him great harm. The same result would be effected towards any other individ- ual than the minister, provided this individual were an object of equal interest to people in general. I think the neighbors of a minister, would they consult his peace and the good of the parish, ought at- times to be blind, or, if not blind, be dumb. There is no manner of use of telling all that we see and know, even if the matter of our obser- vations and knowledge be entirely of an innrocent char- acter." A servant now entering with refreshments changed the subject of remark. : 17   CHAPTER    XVII. A BROTHER'S TROUBLE. AN agent of thae American Board, having passed a Sab- bath with Mr. Eldridge and presented to his people the pressing claims of the heathen, improved the Monday fol- lowing in calling among the families for the purpose of receiving subscriptions in aid of his important enterprise. As he was about entering the door of the parsonage on his return to dinner he saw Mr. Eldridge advancing from the road towards the house; and, waiting on the steps, the two entered the dwelling together. "I have just been to the post office," Mr. Eldridge ob- served, as they were seated, " and have been pretty well recompensed for my trouble. I have received these five letters and seven pamphlets. With your permission, brother, I will read the letters, and you can be looking at the pamphlets." For about fifteen minutes both were thus engaged, and then silence was broken as Mr. Eldridge folded his last letter by his observing,- "It is really shameful that some parishioners have so little consideration for their pastor's usefulness and com- fort as well as for their own improvement. Here is a letter from brother Elton informing me that he shall be under the necessity of remaining at home, and thus be de- prived of his great anticipated pleasure from an attend- (198)   A BROTHER'S TROUBLE.      199 ance upon the meeting of the American Board as he had arranged with me to d. - "Is he prevented fricgoing by any interference of his people?" the agent Al qred. "I am led to believe such to be the case by the manner of your remark."- "I am mortified to say," Mr. Eldridge replied, " that he is, and that he is prevented by an individual, as the prin- cipal cause, who. ought to have been the most anxious to have him attend. It need be no private matter; an indi- vidual in the station occupied by the man who figures largely in the letter, when entirely forgetfulf 6f the spirit and tempers that become him, ought to be exposed. I will read the letter on my own responsibility." Mr. Eldridge then-read as follows:- MY DEAR BROTHER: I find myself under the necessity- of informing you that I have concluded not to go to the meeting of the American-Board woek after next as I had fondly anticipated. I trust it will not make any differ- ence with you. I have come to this decision from pru- dential reasons, and am deeply pained and mortified at their existence. You know something of the character of my people, and therefore can enter into my feelings more than it is possible for a stranger to do. In conver- sation with one of my deacons a few days since, I told him that I hoped he could make it convenient to see that my salary for the last quarter was soon paid, as I wanted some money to go on a journey in the course of a week or two. He asked me where I was intending to go. I re- plied that I was desirous of being at the meeting of the American Board, which was to be held the present year at New York. He at once burst out in a perfect rage- you know he is a very irritable and passionate man and extremely nervous--and said, "Mr. Elton, I advise you not to go, if you mean to stay here as our minister. Now,   200    A VOICE FROM -THE PARSONAGE. you oere off a whole week in May attending the anniver- saries in Boston, and then you were off again at the meet- ing of the general association in June; and a good many of us think that you are off too much at such meetings. It takes a good deal of money to travel so much,- and you ought to be more prudent, If you have more money than is necessary for'your support, you ought to give it to the society to' help, :y: for the meeting house." After this manner he expressed himself at some length. I attempted to argue the matter a little with him, setting forth the in- terest manifested by many of our people in hearing my re- port of the doings of the board, which I am in the habit of giving the Sabbath following its annual meeting, and like- wise that my health required the relaxation of the journey, and that my enlarged usefulness to my people demanded my attendance; but all to no purpose. The deacon re- mained fixed in his opposition to this waste of time and money, as he termed it, and remarked that others in the parish coincided with him in feeling. So I have con-   eluded to remain at home and humor the man this time. i I deeply regret that there can be found in this enlightened age of- the church a deacon so much lost to all that per- , tains to the usefulness of the pastor and the enlarged good i of the people as to manifest the feelings I have now de- scribed. If there be others among my people who sympa- thize with him in opposition to my going to such meetings as that of the American Board, I have no doubt that he is the cause. I shall doubtless have more knowledge on this subject by and by, as there will be many inquiries made : for my reasons in not going this year to the meeting of i this missionary body." ' "There, brother," said Mr. Eldridge, "what do you think of that letter?" "Think? I hardly know what to think," he replied. "I   A BROqHERiS TiSOUBLE.      201 pity brother Elton from the very bottom of my heart for being under the necessity of having sudCt a deacon in his church."   - "The deacon'does not seem to realize that his pastor needs influences from beyond the parish for his extended usefulness," M-r. Eldridge observed. "RHe does not ap- pear to understand that his pastor is really engaged in seeking ways and means of usefulness when he attends the anniversaries in Boston or New York or the meeting of the American Board." "No," said the agent. "I think the soul of this deacon is in a most melancholy condition. Were he in the exer. cise of true Christian feeling, he would at once perceive what excitements to zeal and what encouragement to re- newed labors his pastor wouldc have after-mingling with a great body of Christians who- are deeply interested in the progress of the Redeemer's kingdom." "It is strange a people will be so unwise," said Mr. El- dridge; " but so it is. Brother Elton is a devoted pastor and a most diligent student. He feels the need of 'these meetings, both as a stimulus and as means of relaxation. He rarely exchanges, and is at home most of his time, la- boring for the advancement of his people in all Christian virtues. I shall pity some of his good people; for I have often heard them  say that they always were glad when Mr. Elton could be abroad in attendance on the various anniversaries of the church, because he was so free to com- municate the knowledge he obtained. As he has a very retentive memory, they feel that his reports make'them about as well acquainted with what is said and done at these meetings as they would have been had they been present theinselves." "I am  acquainted with no better way for having the missionary spirit infused into a people than for the pastor to attend the annual meetings of the board," the agent   202     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. remarked. "' He both hears and sees there what he would not otherwise know-; and he acquires an unction, a mission- ary unction, which often endures for months. I am ac- quainted with a large number of brethren who say they will not allow ordinary obstacles to prevent their attend- ance upon our meetings. They say they there acquire an interest sin missions which is a most invaluable help to them -in sustaining the monthly concerts," "I trust that there are but few of the brethren who are prevented from attending such meetings by reasons such as Mr. Elton assigns," Mr. Eldridge continued. "I am not aware that I ever before heard of a brother being opposed in this manner by a deacon," said the agent; "but I have often heard ministers lament that some of their people complained of them for spending so much money in being away at the meetings of the board and others of a kindred character." "I dare say," Mr. Eldridge observed, " there are some minds which cannot appreciate the situation of a minister -his mental wants--his heart wants - the need he has of stimulus and encouragement. There are many indi- viduals who suppose it to be the easiest task to write a sermon -that all a minister has to do is to take his pen and perform the mere manual labor of using it. They do not consider that any previous study is necessary. How he can be aided in this work by spending a week abroad in attendance upon the meetings of bur.:benevolent socie- ties is to them a mystery. Many parishioners appear to think that we ministers go to such occasions for our own enjoyment only. It never enters their minds that we are moved:and induced almost entirely to such attendance by our great desires to be to them of the most advantage- that we go to the anniversaries and to the meetings of the American Board on the same -principle and from the same. motives which send us into our study; viz., to be prepared   i    A BROT'HER'S TROUBLE.      203 to serve them with more fidelity, acceptance, and profit. This contractedness of soul, which would tie 'up a pastor to his own parish the year in and the year but to satisfy the people that their hired servant has not run off, and is not wasting their money and their time too, I wish might not exist. It cannot be, when professors of religion urge such reasons, that they have much Christian feelitig. -' How can they have any desires for the spread of the gospel and the conversion of the heathen when they'are -not willing to allow their pastor to employ the most valuable means, which are alone found in these anniversary meet- ings, for equipping himself fully for his great and arduous work? Were not the flame of godliness flickering in the heart, it appears to me, we- should not hear of any such opposition." "Your remarks," said the agent, "make me think of a people in Vermont who are what may be called a' peculiar people; zealous of good works.' I was with, them about six months since, and passed a\ few days with the greatest pleasure. They were all -alive to the condition of thne heathen, and have for some years past contributed nobly to our treasury. I ascertained that this interest was ex- cited mainly by the narrative of the pastor of the doings of the board and the speeches which were made at its anniversary meetings. I found they were in the habit of remembering the annual meeting in their prayer meetings for weeks before it was to occur, and that of late years it has been their practice to make up a purse to encourage their pastor to attend. The flame of godliness, I assure you, burns brightly up that way. The church there is one of the most energetic and prosperous churches in our land."' "I am most happy to hear of such at bright example of Christian activity," Mr. Eldridge remarked. I very much wish it might be extensively followed, and that those in our churches who would interpose obstacles to the attendance   204     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. of their pastors on the meetings of our benevolent socie. ties might feel themselves rebuked by it. I dare say that 'Vermont pastor has a light heart and goes on his way rejoicing. As he goes forth bearing precious seed, he can- not feel that there may be many of his people who will trample it down to prevent it springing up and bearing fruit." "No, no," said the agent; "the good Vermont brother feels that his people water where he plants, and that they are equally interested with himself in the success of his labors." "His joy at the judgment as well as the joy of his people must be rich," Mr. Eldridge continued, " when he appears before the righteous Judge, saying, ' Lord, here I am and the children which thou hast given me.' I could wish brother Elton's deacon might think of that great day. If he is not careful, I am afraid he will not be-found among the number when the brother shall present his children." it   I    CHAPTER    XVIII. ANOTHER PHASE OP PASTORAL LIFE. THE health of the good wife of Squire Davidson having been for some time in a very precarious state, it became necessary to seek its restoration and her comfort in travel- ling. Consequently she was much away from home, some- times on a long journey and at other times on a short ex- cursion. The last winter she passed at the south with her children in Virginia, and returned in April somewhatim. proved in health, though by no means out of danger from that insidious disease, so common at the north, that con- signs numberless victims to the last resting-place of man. She bad not been, at home many weeks before she was admonished of the need of another journey; and her hus- band, having important business to transact in Greenfield, some seventy miles distant from their residence, proposed to her to take an excursion thither. It was now the commence- ment of the: beautiful month of June, and it was first decided that thoy^would set off the next week; but the suggestion bei,agmade  by aunt Sarah, who was rapidly verging to'wa-iA;.that bourn from whence none return, that the anniversary. of her past-:,settlement. would occur on the next week, Mrs. ]Qiid0   she -could not possibly forego the pleas g   r:m.

Accordingly it was not till the Monday fol- lowing this event that the squire and his wife left home for Greenfield. Not being in any measure urged to rapidity in their movements,-indeed, the health of Mrs. Davidson absolutely interdicted this, - they did not reach their destined town until the following Thursday. Having completed his business at an earlier period than was anticipated, the squire proposed to vary their route homeward for the purpose of passing the Sabbath with a much-esteemed clerical friend, Mr. Willy, who was settled in Stanly. The suggestion was very pleasant to Mrs. Da- vidson, as she had long been wishing to redeem a pledge made to Mr. and Mrs. Willy of a visit. Accordingly, after dinner on Friday, the squire directed his course to- wards Stanly, at which place he arrived on the following afternoon long before the sun was shaded in the west. Their reception at the parsonage was the more gratifying because it was so very unexpected. Many a time had the wish been expressed by Mr. and Mrs. Willy that they might have the pleasure of a visit from them; for the remem- brance of the days they passed a few years before under their most hospitable roof had afforded them at many intervals since the most lively satisfaction. They were anxious for an opportunity to attempt the reciprocation of their kindness, and indulged the hope that such a desire might be gratified; but perhaps they were not very strong in the faith that such desire would be realized, as they were well aware how very-large was the circle of their friends who moved in the same elevated sphere in which a kind Providence had placed them. Not because Squire Davidson was accounted an aristocrat, and could find no enjoyment in the humble abode of a country cler- gyman in a secluded territory, was the faith of Mr. and Mrs. Willy slender that they should one day have them as   ANOTHER PHASE OF PASTORAL LIFE.   -207 their guests. Far from this. Though very wealthy, and though he and his family moved in several cities in the highest grade of society, yet there was not the first feeling in the heart of Squire Davidson and wife that begat in them the sentiment that they were in the least descending when they were in the company of any of their Christian friends who lived, not for this world alone, but for a higher, a purer state. Because their presence among. the hills of Stanly and in the parsonage of its peoplei surely evinced an interest which, perhaps, could not have been more strongly expressed in- the occupants of this parsonage, did Mr. and Mrs. Willy greatly rejoice when they welcomed them to their door. Stanly was not a very remarkable place. Seldom was a carriage seen passink through the town that was not recognized as belonging either to some of its inhabitants or as coming from an adjacent territory. When, there- fore, the squire rode up to Mr. Willy's with his large gray horse in an elegantly sparkling. harness, and attached to a splendid chaise, the little folks within, of whom there were six boys, were in no little commotion. There was ejaculation among them and wonderment. Such an estab- lishment, perhaps, they had never before seen. True, Colonel Hollis and Captain Handy had covered wagons; but most' of the carriages which moved in their vicinity were of the ,ruder:sort, without any top, either of canvas or leather. The little hands were so busy with the differ- ent parts and trappings of the harness, and the questions to papa were so many about this and that, as--retarded Mr. Willy somewhat in disencumbering the steed and in securing the chaise under cover. At last, however, the task was accomplished, and, divesting himself of his working frock, put on always for service like this, Mr. Willy was in the parlor with his distinguished guests. Mrs. Willy thereupon left the room for the labor of   208     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. preparing tea, which, perhaps, would have been less perplex- ing and sooner accomplished if she had not been a pastor's wife, but that of a mechanic or farmer, or even of a common day laborer, who was promptly paid for his services. Pay day had not been recently in her husband's parish; and many articles which would have been in the house, out of which a respectable supper could be prepared, had such a day not been very remote, were not there. A little flour had been saved from the barrel presented by an unknown friend some four months before,: and from this the good wife proceeded to make some biscuit; but as for cake or pies, alas I1 Mrs. Willy longed most wistfully for the means of making them; but the country parsonage was, and had been for a long time, unblessed with them. Whilst thus perplexed and mortified, she involuntarily burst forth with saying, ' I declare, I only wish some of our people were here now who say so much about the good living of their minister and the easy task of his wife; I rather think they would alter their opinions somewhat. I guess they would find that we did not live on the fat of the land." However, checking her impatience and murmuring, she proceeded to her work, made her biscuit, spread her table, using the cloth, china, and other table furniture which be- longed to the outfit her father gave her at her marriage. She drew from the oven the baked beans and brown bread, and presently- announced to her husband- and friends that tea was waiting. When all were seated at the table, and as Mrs. Willy was pouring the tea, she discovered the absence of her best sugar bowl. Calling to her child, she asked him to go into the parlor and bring it out. The child obeyed, and, returning, said there was nothing in it. This-announcement crimsoned the face of the mother ; for she well knew- that, if there was no sugar there, the house did not afford the article. "I really thought there was sugar there," Mrs. Willy   ANOTHER PHASE OF PASTORAL LIFE.    209 remarked. "Well, I hope our friends will excuse us if we help them to brown sugar." "O, certainly;"Mrs. Davidson replied. "We are not at all particular." "Your acquaintance with the circumstances of minis- ters, squire," Mr. Willy observed, "has doubtless led you to feel that they often have to do as they can, and not as they would." "I am sorry,"' said the squire, " that the churches will allow it-; but it is a most melancholy consideration, that often the greatest injustice is done to the clergy, both in deficiency of compensation and in the great irregularity in the payment of their paltry salaries. I could wish it were otherwise; for no class in the community are entitled to better compensation than ministers." "I really wish," said Mrs. Willy, "'that some of our people could hear you make remarks like this, as it often comes to our ears that they think Mr. Willy- has too large a salary." "How much has he?"Mrs. Davidson inquired. "Only four hundred and fifty dollars; and that is very tardily paid," Mrs. Willy said. "They are'now owing two hundred dollars for the last year, which closed in February, and we have had but about thirty dollars from them on the first quarter of the present year." "How do your people think you can get along, Mr. Willy," the squire asked, " if they are so dilatory in paying you your salary?" "O, I do not know as they think at all on the subject," Mr. Willy replied. "I have a little land, and perhaps they think that I can raise enough from that to live upon." "Well, it is unjust for them to withhold from you your due," said the squire, "even if your land does produce enough to support your family, which I presume is not the case." 18  l   A 'VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "Far from it," said Mr. Willy. "I have not more than twelve acres, and seven of that is fit only for pasture. I can keep one cow and horse only; and I never plant much more than a single acre." Tea being over, and the squire and his wife having gone back to the parlor, Mrs. Willy stopped her husband, who was following them, and detained him a while in the room where the tea table stood, to deliberate upon the state of the pantry. " What shall we do, husband ? We have no more flour in the house. The last two quarts, which I have carefully kept for these three weeks for an emergency, I have usea for the biscuit we had for tea.( We have no fresh meat, you know; no white sugar, and but little of brown; no pies, nor any thing to make them of; and here we are, with these rich people with us to stay over the Sabbath, and perhaps longer I" "I will go right away, my dear, to Deacon Foster and borrow of him five dollars, and will go to the store and the butcher's and get a supply. Deacon Foster, you know, always has a little money by him, and he has often told me that he would share the last dollar with me if it were necessary for our comfort or convenience." "I know that, husband, and I thought there was no other way for you to do but to go to him. He will un- derstand the case, and so will his wife." Returning to the parlor, Mr. Willy sat a while con- versing with his friends until Mrs. Willy had completed the task which always falls to the wife, in the absence of a daughter or maid, after a meal. When she appeared, her husband excused himself from the circle by saying that he had a little business to transact which would oblige him to be absent for a short time. As we are now to follow him to the house of his good deacon, it may be interesting to the reader to know more   'I   A1OTiB''   PHASE OF PASTORAL LIFE.   211   of the man from whom he was sure of receiving important aid in this the pastor's time of need. Deacon Foster-can- not be set forth as a man remarkable either for general intelligence, or refinement of manners, or greatness of wealth ; for, though " a good liver," his farm and stock- which were neither extensive - constituted all his proper- ty. Having always lived where his pastor found him, and never been thirty miles from home in his life of sixty years, his intercourse with the world would not very materially enlarge his mind or improve his manners. The authors with whom he was most familiear were greatly antiquated; but, because they treated of subjects which for some reason or other interested him more than all others, he chose to devote what leisure time he had--which was not much on the weekdays      to them almost exclusively. These authors were such men as Moses, and Joshua, and David, and Solomon, Jeremiah, Isaiah, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Paul. He read them and pondered what they wrote so much as to have his mind and heart very much imbued wit; their spirit; and, because of this, he most nobly filled the important office in the church which gave him the title of deacon. All thought that he was a fit man for a deacon because the Bible had so much to do with his thoughts and his conduct. Somehow or other, there was no craftiness about him, nor overreaching, nor hy- pocrisy. His face on the Sabbath was no longer than on other days; and he was, withal, bound up in his pastor and in ministers in general; and the impression very generally prevailed that he was thus singular because he read the Bible so much and was so careful to practise 'what he read.. After a ride of some ten minutes the pastor of Stanly was at the door of this good deacon, which, in answer to 1his knock, was soon opened by a lady whose countenance was the personification of goodness, and was therefore    212     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE.    ,  every way worthy to be the companion of the man whom all th'e community around had long called the good deacon. "We are very glad to see you, Mr. Willy," Mrs. Fos- ter remarked. "Mr. Foster and I have just been talking about you; and he is getting ready to go to your house, I believe. You've got some company, have you not, Mr. Willy?" "What makes you ask that question, my good woman?" inquired the pastor. O," she replied, " neighbor Porter was here about two hours ago, and he told us he saw you taking out a very beautiful horse from a grand carriage .as he passed your house this afternoon. We thought it was likely some of your friends had come to spend the Sabbath with you." "Well, it is even so," Mr. Willy observed. "We have been taken altogether by surprise by two of the best peo- ple on the earth; and, what is a little unfortunate, we have but very little in the house wherewith we can de- cently entertain them. For this reason I have come down here to see the deacon and get a little help."  "We have been talking about this since neighbor Por- ter was here," Mrs. Foster observed. "I told my hus- band I was afraid your wife would not be, prepared for company, and I said to him he must go up there to-night and see you." "You are a very thoughtful woman," observed Mr. Wil- ly; " and I am much obliged to you for your considera- tion."                I "It is too bad that our people are so backward about paying the salary," Mrs. Foster said. "It is very unfortunate for us," Mr. Willy remarked. "I should not have been down here to-night in this anx- ious state of mind if I only had my salary paid with any decent promptness. Where is your husband?" "He is out to the barn dressing a calf. When he heard *i    ANOTHER PHASE Or PASTORAL LIFE.   213 that you had company, he said he would kill the calf im- mediately, and not wait till next week, as he was calcu- lating to do. He thought the leg of veal he was intend- ing to give you might be as acceptable at this time as at any other." This announcement was too much for the sensitive na- ture of the pastor, and, overcome with emotion, he had to rise and turn his face to the window to conceal the tears which were trickling down his face. " O," thought he, whilst brushing away the tears, " if all my people, or but a small part of them, felt as this family feel for their minister, what a load of care and anxiety would be removed and what strong encouragement there would be to labor hard for their good I Howfreely I would study and how cheer fully labor l" "I believe," said Mr. Willy, "I will go out to the barn and see your husband." "He is coming in, sir; I hear his steps,",said Mrs. Foster. Presently the door opened, and the good deacon ap- peared with a fine leg of veal in his hand, and, as he laid it down on the table, humorously said, after welcoming his pastor,-- "You did not hear the pig squeal, did you, Mr. Willy?" The' pastor, comprehending the significance of the re- mark, (what minister of a few years could not?) good naturedly said,-- "My ears have not been greeted by such a sound; if they had been, I should have been tempted, within the last few hours, to have followed the direction of the noise, I confess. Deacon, I have come down here to say to you that I have got company at my house, and nothing for them to eat but pork and beans and brown bread; and I want to borrow five dollars to go to the store and get ak supply."  I   'J.   214     A VOIC  E FROM THE PARSONAGE. "Yes, yes," said the deacon ; "I was afraid so. I heard you had company, and was going up to see you. You may have the five dollars; but perhaps it won't be necessary for you to go to the store to-night. Mrs. Foster, have you got the basket ready?" "O, yes," the good woman said. "Mr. Willy, I told you my husband was going up to your house with a leg of veal; and I have put into a basket two loaves of white bread, and some cake, and half a dozen piesi. Now, if there is any thing else that you want, if we have got them, you are welcome- to them. They are your due from the parish."    I ' "As the deacon has loaned me five dollars," said Mr. Willy, "I guess I'll go to the store." "What are you going there for?" asked the deacon. "Do tell; for it is some way there, and I don't want you to go if it is not necessary. I want you to save your money for some other time." "Well, to be frank, I was going to get some flour, and some meat, and some white sugar. The meat, through your kindness, I shall not have to get, and the bread will last till Monday ; but we have no white sugar, and but a little of any kind." "You need not go to the store," Mrs. Foster said. "I will get you some sugar." The clean napkin was soon withdrawn from the new bushel basket, which had never before been used, and there was just space enough left to admit two papers of sugar which the good woman had carefully put up. The cloth was then tied down, and the deacon took the basket to the wagon of his pastor and gently laid it therein. Returning to the house, the pastor, in the overflowing of his heart, thanked both him and his wife for their very acceptable donations, and, taking from his pocket his wallet, handed back the five- dollars he had but a few moments .befor   ANOTHER PHASE OP PASTORAL LIME.    215 received from the deacon, saying he should not need it now. "Well," said the deacon, "you are very welcome to it. I shall not take it. You ought to be with money in your pocket; and I mean to make some stir in the parish now that I think will make the people pay up. It is wicked that things should be so. They can't agree to give half what they are able ;and it is a shame that they don't pay up the little they agree to give." Mr. Willy, touched in every part of his soul by the tender, generous impulses of both the deacon and his wife, which led him to feel how well they appreciated the situ- ation of their pastor, was soon on his way to his home. Twilight had nearly gone as he rode into his yard. As he was taking his horse from the wagon the squire came out, and, noticing a new  basket therein, remarked, he was afraid his friend had been put to some inconvenience by having company come in so unexpectedly. "I suppose you have been to the store, Mr. Willy? as I see you have a new basket in your wagon." "No, sir. I  have been prevented from going by the generosity of one of my deacons." "Well, I  am glad you have some green spots in your field," said the squire. "They are very refreshing to a pastor's heart." "I have got but one such spot," Mr. Willy said, ' in my- territory; and I have been to that to-night." "Better have one than none," the squire remarked. "Some pastors that I know have but an arid plain for their field." "Yes, yes. I   know that, squire. It is but a poor reward that most ministers get in this world." "The riches are to come, then," the squire observed. "That is all the consolation and encouragement which the great body of the clergy have," Mr. Willy said. x/   A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGE. The pastor's horse was now in his stall, and the wagon under cover, and the large basket was taken right into the room where Mrs. Willy and Mrs. Davidson were sit- ting; and, as it was laid down by the feet of the former, Mr. Willy said, "There, wife; there is a present from Deacon Foster." "As you have brought in the basket here, I suppose you intend that I shall open it at once," Mrs. Willy replied. So with her scissors she cut the cord which confined the. covering and proceeded to take out the contents. As she took the two papers Mr. Willy observed, " That is white and brown sugar, I suppose." "And there," said Mrs. Willy, "are two loaves -what large ones --of white bread; and here are two, four, six pies." "And here," said Mr. Willy, catching up the other,- "here is a large leg of veal." "Very acceptable and very opportune are all these articles," Mrs. Willy remarked. "Now, to tell the truth, Mrs. Davidson, we have pretty nigh run ashore for eat- ables except of the ruder kind, and these articles are just what we need. I remarked at tea, you know, that our salary was not paid very promptly; and we have had to live of late almost any how. It is very trying; but so it is." "There is not all," Mr. Willy remarked. "The deacon gave me a five-dollar bill. 'Tis true I went down there expressly to borrow the amount for the purpose of going to the store and the butcher's; but they had anticipated our wants in part and insisted on knowing all; and thus I have been prevented from going farther. They had heard that we had company; and the deacon, intending to kill a calf the beginning of next week and give us a part, thought he would not wait, but killed it just after Mr. Por- ter told him he saw me taking care of a splendid horse, and was intending to come up here this evening with the   ANOTHER PHASE OF PASTORAL LIFE.   217   veal, and, I suppose; the bread and pies. I handed him back the money which he loaned me; but he would not take it. He said I ought not to be without money, and I was very welcome to the five dollars." "The deacon and his wife are parishioners worth hav- ing," Mrs. Willy observed. "Well, Mr. Willy, cannot any thing be done to get your people into better habits ?" the squire asked. "A change might be effected, I think," said Mrs. Willy, " if husband would think it to be his duty to make a little stir about their delinquency in paying the salary. It is nothing but inconsideration on the part of the people. They are an able people, and might pay double what they agree to pay and not feel it at all." "I never like to say much about my salary,y' Mr. Willy remarked; " but I have thought for. some time past that I should be obliged to do something. But perhaps I shall be saved that necessity now; fqr the deacon told me he intended to make an effort which he thought would bring the people to their senses."  "I have been telling husband," Mrs. Willy said, "that he ought to insist on having another hundred dollars added to his salary, and to have it paid promptly.!" "That would be unwise, I think," remarked !r. Willy, "to ask for more salary." "I don't think so," the wife replied. "The parishes about us who have settled ministers lately pay six and seven hundred dollars now, and they areanot so able as our parish to do so, I presume, if we. should leave here, the people would not think of paying less than. seen hundred."  "I have no doubt of that,' Mr. Willy said; "but they only agreed to give me four hundred at first; and I ac- cepted the salary." "But times have changed, you know, husband, since 19 ,   218     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONTAGE. you were settled. Money don't go so far now as it did then." "The people ought to think of this, I confess," said Mr,. Willy, " and ought to come up unasked and pay a suita- ble salary; but it would be unwise in me to insist on their doing any thing more than fulfilling their agreement with me and every quarter promptly make a payment." "That is a fact," the squire remarked. "Parishes who settled pastors years ago, when the means of living were not so high as they niow are and when the expenses of the clergy were not so many as at the present time, ought to be reminded of their obligations to add to the compensation of their ministers by the consideration that, were they now to settle a. pastor, they would be obliged to pay a much larger salary." "Certainly it is but justice for them to do so," Mr. Willy remarked. "Because I was fortunate enough to have a few hundred dollars by my wife, sufficient to pay for the place where I now live, it is wrong for the people to think that I shall not move away if my salary is not raised, and to be willing that I should have a less sum than what they know they would be obliged to pay another minister." "It is morally wrong, I think, to treat a pastor in this way," the squire said; '" and I cannot believe he would be thus treated if the people would only consider a little with the Bible in their hands." "O," said Mr. Willy, " if people had this precious book in their hands more, and if divine truth had' more reflec- tion by them, ministers would never have any reason to complain. If all the people were like good Deacon Fos- ter, what blessed times these would be I And he is only what the Bible has made him.", The evening being now far spent, worship was ob- served, and the friends separated for the night.   A NEW PHASE OP PASTORAL LIFE.    219 On Monday morning the squire remarked,- "I have been thinking anew, since I have been here, bow much a people lost by cutting short a pastor's sup- port. When a minister is pinched he cannot be a free man; he cannot study with his whole mind; -hemcannot give his whole heart to his work. He must be anxious, often -very anxious, about his family; so much so as to unfit him for duty-." "There is too much truth in that, squire," Mr. Willy remarked. "I know all about it from much deep and bitter experience." "Now, your people," the squire said," you have told me, were all well off, and there are some hundred families of them; they ought to be ashamed of themselves to treat you as they do. They ought to pay promptly your salary, and to give you at least seven hundred dollars. They make a very respectable congregation, I see. They have a fine house for a sanctuary; and really they ought to be mortified that they do not handsomely support you and a little more. They would gain by it, I know." "I rather think they would have more Sermons from me which were better if they should do this," Mr. Willy observed. "I have no doubt of it, sir," said the squire. "It is not in ordinary humanity to do much when perplexed and burdened with anxiety, especially in the way of profound study." "I am sorry to see you getting ready to leave us," Mrs. Willy observed to Mrs. Davidson, who entered the room in a manner that denoted such an event to be nigh. "We have made a long visit, and I feel somewhat anxious to return home,"' Mrs. Davidson replied. x   220    A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGES Soon the carriage was at the door, and the baggage in the chaise; and, as the squire was about getting in, he handed Mr. Willy a-very small piece of paper, folded into the dimensions of a pipe stem, and remarked, "This may be of some use to you, Mr. Willy, after we are out of town." Then, bidding all anew' good by, the horse fleetly moved out of the parsonage yard towards his own plenti- ful stable.  On entering the house and unfolding the thin paper, the reader may judge of the use it would be in the straitened pastor's family when informed -it was a twenty-dollar bank biN ,.  )   ,              .   CHAPTER XIX. AN  REA-SOVABLE PASTORAL TAX. "I BELIEVE I shall not subscribe so much this year as I was," said a parishioner to a committee man whose office it was to raise the pastor's salary. "Our minister must be getting rich." This remark illustrates a feeling often expressed in many a country parish.

The gentle- man had not long been -seated before the doctor entered, when the following conversation took place, which both amused and edified Mr. Eldridge:- "I thought I would run over, doctor," said Mr. Fisher, "and see you about that council which is to meet next week, and ascertain how it will be best for'us to go." "I do not know," the doctor replied, " as it will be con- venient for me to attend. The distance is so great that I can hardly afford the time which an attendance would re- quire. It would about spoil the week." "I suppose it is an important case," Mr. Fisher ob- served, "and your presence is much desired, or they would not have sent such a great distance to our church." "Yes," said the doctor; "I regard it as an important case.' Since the letter missive arrived I have received a letter from one of the committee of the church urging me by all means to be present." "I rather think you had better conclude to, go, doctor. It is a pleasant season of the year, and the journey, un- doubtedly, would be beneficial. to you. You need relaxa- tion. If you will go it would give me pleasure to defray all the expenses of your journey." i"I am much obliged to you for your generosity," the doctor replied; " and perhaps you have made the induce- ment sufficiently strong. I will think over the matter and inform you to-morrow morning of my decision. It will be considerable of a tax upon you, Mr. Fisher, should I conclude to go as you so kindly propose." "I never before have been chosen a delegate," Mr. 'Fisher remarked; "but I supposed it was expected that the pastor would not be at any expense in attending a council. The delegate usually-pays the charges at these times, does he not, doctor?"   AN UNREASONABLE PASTORAL TAX.    223 The d6dctor, with a smile, observed, "Sometimes, when I have been called to a council in the adjacent towns, my delegate has invited me to ride with him; but I rather think I have the morefrequently gone at my own expense, and, when I have gone in my carriage, carried my delegate." "I do not think," Mr. Fisher said, "that you have been treated fairly by your.,delegates. They ought to have borne all the expense." "I am not sure about that," the doctor replied. "I do not think it decided yet that a delegate, any more than a pastor, should meet the charges incurred by attending councils." "The pastor, you know, doctor, always goes; but his delegate is not often the same individual. It would be better, therefore, for the delegate to bear such expense than for the pastor; for in this way the burden might, in the course of years, fall equally upon all the brethren of the church, as they might every one be chosento this service." s I think," the doctor remarked, "there it something in this consideration in favor of a delegate's meeting the ex- pense rather than the pastor; but I have long been of the opinion the tax ought to be borne directly by the church. Now, I have been settled in the ministry upwards of forty years; and, as I have kept an account of my yearly ex- penses, I know what it has cost me to attend councils., In the early part of my ministry I was not called to any great distance by such occasions, but for many years past I have been often required to go very far from home for the purpose of attending councils. Now, Mr. Fisher, what do you think my expenses have been on an average for forty years past in attending councils, computing my time at ordinary day wages, and my travelling charges, includ- ing, of course, pay for my horse and chaise, when I have gone with them?"       - "It would be impossible for me to answer your ques-.   224     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. tion," Mr. Fisher replied. "I am aware that you have been to a large number of councils for several years past. Perhaps it has'cost you twenty dollars a year, and perhaps forty." "Well, sir," said the doctor; " since I received the let- ter requesting my attendance at the council next week, I have computed the expense which I have incurred for the last forty-two years in attending councils, and I find that it will average thirty-four dollars and sixty-three cents per year." "That i, a large sum, doctor," said Mr. Fisher, who, taking his pencil, proceeded to find the full' amount; and having done this, he exclaimed, in great astonishment, "It makes fourteen hundred fifty-four dollars and eighty- six cents." "Yes, sir, that is the amount;- one thousand four hun: dred dollars and- eighty-six cents," said the doctor. "The people do not understand this subject," Mr. Fisher, observed, "do they, doctor?" "That is a fact; they do not," the doctor replied. "Neither ministers nor people are aware of the great tax imposed on the clergy by attendance on councils., It is a great item in the expenses of many ministers, a very great item." "Well, I suppose you are oftener called to councils than ministers in general," said Mr. Fisherl' "Not more frequently than many others," the pastor re- plied. ' I very often meet the same brethren on different councils. The more a minister is called to attend on such occasions, the more he will be. The longer a minister lives, the more he is called on councils in important and difficult cases." "I think, sir, in these days, when so much is doing to improve the age, something might be done in relation to this evil, for it is a great evil to pastors," Mr. Fisher re- marked.   AN UNREASONABLE PASTORAL TAX.    225 "I have long thought," the doctor observed," that the churches ought to be enlightened on this subjiect, and that some principles ought to be agreed upon whereby pastors can be relieved from this heavy tax." "Well, doctor, if you go next week, I'll see that you are not the poorer for your journey." "You will be, however," said the pastor, smiling. "I'll take care, doctor, not to get in as deep in such matters as you have, I assure you," Mr. Fisher observed. "I presume so," said the doctor ; "laymen have a better wisdom in these concerns than pastors." "I do not think there are- many laymen to be found who would expend nearly fifteen hundred dollars in the course of forty years in attendance on councils," Mr. Fisher re- marked. "Ah, well," said the doctor, "I think the church ought to meet these expenses either the one inviting a council ought to pay those composing it, so that they will suffer no loss in attending, or each church sending ought to defray the expenses of both pastor and delegate." "Either of these ways would relieve the pastor, and not be any great tax upon the delegate, too, would they not, doctor?  The suggestion is a new one to me, I confess, and I think it would be new to most of our churches," Mr. Fisher observed. "I should think there might be an equitable plan adopted in relation to this matter. Which' of the methods do you think would-be best, doctor?" "I have not yet fully made up mymind on the subject," the pastor replied. "There are weighty considerations in- favor of each; but I am leaning strongly towards the one that brings the entire expense on the-church which calls the council. In the first place, it is more accordant with the principle that regulates the general transaction of business. Now, if the machinery in your factory does not work well, and you cannot tell exactly what the   226    o A VOICE- FROM THE PARSONAGE. matter is, yon would not think of writing a letter to some individual who resides fifteen or forty miles from you, who you thought could remedy the evil, requesting his presence at your establishment to advise and assist you in the premises, without expecting to remunerate him well for his attendance and services. Nor would the individual come without expecting a fair compensation." "That is all true, doctor." "Well, if our town," the pastor continued, " has business to be transacted in another part of the state which requires the cool and patient consideration of some practical men, they would not think of sending one of the selectmen into the neighborhood where the business is- to be done, and ordering him to look'up some wise and fit persons there, and ask their advice and attention to the matter, without paying them for their trouble." "Certainly not," Mr. Fisher replied. "We should ex- pect a good round bill would be the consequence." "To illustrate the case a little further," the doctor re- plied: "supposing your factory company and the other one near you should have a dispute about the right of water; the two corporations, in agreeing to refer their differences to an arbitration, would not expect the arbiters to come here and spend one or more days in considering the matter without compensating them -fully for their trouble." "Of course not," Mr. Fisher said. "They would come, not for their pleasure or profit, but for the advantage of the parties calling them.?' "Very true," said the doctor. "Now, for whose benefit does an ecclesiastical council convene? Manifestly for the advantage of the party or parties calling such council. Now, why not have those who invite the ,council pay the expenses of those composing it?" "I can pee no good- reason why they should not," Mr. Fisher replied,   AN UNREASONABLE PASTORAL TAX.    227 "There is another consideration," the pastor observed, "which has much influence with me in having the expenses of a council borne by the party calling it; and that is, councils would not be so frequent as they now are, nor would they be as large. If a church knew they would be liable to pay a large amount if a council were called, the occa- sion for convening such a body would be really urgent. Every possible endeavor would be made-to avoid the necessity of such an expense; and I have no doubt that many difficulties would be adjusted, without being made public through a council, to the great saving of private reputation and of scandal to the cause of Christ. When every attempt for a private settlement of difficulties: had failed and there was real necessity for advice from without, care would be taken when a council was called to have it as small as possible; for the smaller the number a council contains, the smaller would be the expense." "I think, doctor, you have made out a pretty clear case, that it would be best to have the party calling a council be at all the expense attending its convocation. I wish you would publish something on this subject in the re- ligious newspapers. I have been astonished at what you have told me this afternoon in relation to the tax which has been levied on you by your attendance on councils; and I think people in general, were they to have a few such facts laid before them, accompanied by such sugges- tions as you have made to me, would be for having some method adopted whereby the clergy would not be im. poverished as you have been. Every pastor, to a greater or less extent, must be a sufferer under the present system of calling councils." "That is true," the doctor remarked. "Ministers in general may not think much on the subject; but their attendance in council is no small item in the expenses to which they are subject."   228    A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. Just now a carriage-was driven into the doctor's yard, and presently a neighboring minister was introduced. "I can't stop long, doctor. I was riding by, an'd I could not very well resist my inclination to call a mo- ment," Rev. Mr. Annable observed. "Sit down, brother, sit down," said the doctor ; " don't be in suci haste; our tea wills be ready soon." "O,I cannot possibly stop; I have a lecture this even- ing, and I must hasten home. I did not know how to leave ; but I could not well avoid it. I have been over to brother Tenney's parish to attend a funeral. He has gone on a journey, you know. I don't know how they happened to send for me ; but the friends of the deceased did ; and so I hired a horse and buggy and travelled eleven miles over there; and now I am on my way home." "They paid you for your carriage hire, I hope," the doctor said. "Not a word was said about that," Mr. Annable said. "The friends thanked me very much for my trouble; but nothing nore was said."  "There, Mr. Fisher," said the doctor, " there is another outlet to a minister's salary. The attendance of funerals in adjacent towns which happen to be destitute of pastors often is the-occasion of much expense to a pastor. "Mr. Fisher and I," the doctor continued, " have been conversing before you came in, brother Annable, on the tax to which- pastors were subjected by reason of their being called so frequently to sit in councils; and now your having been abroad .to a distant parish to officiate at a funeral suggests another way in which we are often taxed." "It is something of a tax, I confess," Mr. Annable ob- served. "I shall have to pay out for carriage hire this afternoon about two dollars. Week before last I was   AN UNREASONABLE PASTORAL TAX.    229 called to Highland parish, about seven miles from' my - house, where you know they are without a minister, to at- tend a funeral, and I spent one dollar and a quarter for horse hire. I presume I pay ten or twelve dollars every year for a conveyance to the funerals I am called to at- tend abroad; and I do not know as ever I was offered a cent for my trouble. Well, I must be going, or I shall not be in season for my lecture." X After his departure Mr. Fisher observed, - "I have discovered this afternoon, doctor, no small channel through which a pastor's salary passes out with- out being of any benefit to himself or family." "Don't you wonder now," inquired the pastor," that ministers don't lay up something handsome out of their salaries?" "I think," Mr. Fisher replied, "'the wonder is, how they can get along as well as they do and live,. It is high time, I think, that the community were better informed in relation to these unthought-of expenses of ministers, such as those arising from their attending councils and funerals in  abroad." "There might be much said to enlighten the people in relation to this matter," the doctor observed; "and I think something ought to be done. When the ,services of a clergyman at a funeral out of his own parish are re- quested, the friends of the deceased sending for him ought by all means to remunerate him would they be just in their, dealings." "Most certainly they ought," Mr. Fisher replied. "A minister, of all men, ought not to be required to pay, from his scanty salary a single dollar unnecessarily; and I am sure it is not necessary for him to do it when called abroad to attend funerals; for he ought to go at the ex- pense of those who desire his services." 20   '              By 230     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. Taking his-hat in hand to leave for home, Mr. Fisher continued, - "Well, doctor, I can see no other way to remove the evils of which we have been speaking but to agitate the subject in the community.. I think, if the attention of the churches was directed to this matter, they would soon be disposed to abate the injustice which is now so often prac- tised towards ministers. I cannot think many years would pass before pastors would find- themselves much relieved. It is now almost intolerable that these heavy items of ex- pense of which we have been speaking should be allowed to diminish the value of a pastor's salary. I am persuaded that it is nothing but inconsideration on the part of the people that now imposes these taxes upon ministers, which I desire to see speedily removed. Agitate, then, the sub- ject, and invite your brethren to assist in this important work; and you may depend upon it there will be better times for the ministry in respect to' these evils." !    . X    CHAPTER XX. -THE PASTOR'S WIFE' MRS. DAVIDSON, though in very feeble health, was yet benefited, as she conceived, by being out in the open air. Consequently, on almost every pleasant day, she might be seen abroad. On an afternoon in September she called at the house of her pastor, and was introduced by the girl who answered at the door into tfle parlor. Mr. Eldridge being absent, Mrs. Davidson sat some time alone, and, be- ing informed that Mrs. Eldridge was at home, wondered at her long delay in coming into the room. At length the door was opened and the pastor's wife entered, having a countenance that denoted that she had been seeking relief from  grief in tears. Having always received so much sympathy from her friend who had called as to regard her with some of those feelings which exist in the heart of a confiding daughter towards a kind, watchful, and indul- gent mother, she was not, therefore, embarrassed or dis. trustful, but at once remarked, on seeing Mrs. Davidson, that she had been up stairs for upwards of an hour havino "a good cry."  "You know, Mrs. Davidson, that a minister's wife is in a peculiar situation, and that her trials come sometimes in a sudden and unexpected manner." "O, yes; dear," the good lady observed; -"I do -know that your position in life is very trying; and sometimes I -r*.                    (a31)   232     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. have wondered that any young lady would consent to marry a clergyman." "I have thought that I should never be so affected again as I have been this afternoon," Mrs. Eldridge re- marked, "by any thing which might be said to me by indi- viduals in the parish." "What have you heard recently, my friend?"Mrs. Da- vidson inquired. "O, nothing more than I have heard before, I suppose. Miss Bemis has called here this afternoon, and she has had considerable to say in regard to my domestic matters and my influence here in the parish." "I really wish Miss Bemis had something else to do besides gathering up the gossip of the community and coming here to report to you,"' Mrs. Davidson observed. "She annoys me very much, and has done so ever since I have been married," Mrs. Eldridge said. "It almost makes me shudder whenever I see her; for I always ex- pect to hear some'unpleasant tale." "What has she been saying to-day?"Mrs. Davidson inquired., "She has been talking about the appearance of our house for one thing," X Mrs. Eldridge said. "The appearance of your house! Why, what of it? Does it not appear well enough to suit her ladyship?" Mrs. Davidson asked. "I do not know of a house in town where there is more neatness displayed, both in doors and out, than what ,I have seen here; and I have heard the same remark made a thousand times, I dare say, by different people in the parish." "I suppose the house did not look very neat week be- fore last," Mrs. Eldridge said. "You know I was sick most of the week, and our girl was sick too. A strange girl could nob be expected to keep all things in their places and to preserve the house in the same neatness as she might if I had been about to assist and direct her."   THE PASTOR'S WIFE.       233 "Did Miss Bemis particularize the appearance of your house week before last?"Mrs. Davidson asked. "She was obliged to at last," Mrs. Eldridge said; "for I thought it was my duty to be pretty plain with her, she was so direct in her insinuations; and I asked her when she or any one else had ever seen the confusion and dirt here which she'had the impudence to describe. I told her I had never seen the house looking as she said it did ; and I asked her to tell me when it' did look after this manner. Then she was obliged to say it did look so week before last." "How cruel, how very cruel and inconsiderate, it was in Miss Bemis to say any thing about such things when she knew that you were sick at that time and that Han- nah was sick too! I should have thought she would have had more discretion," Mrs. Davidson said. "She remarked, by way of apology, at last, that she should not have said any thing about it; but -she had heard so much said in the parish in regard to the state of the house then that she felt it to be her duty to converse with me in relation to it." "You had a good many in to see you that week, did you not?"Mrs. Davidson asked. "O, yes; there were many who called in to inquire after my health; and I suppose there were some who took oc- casion to gratify their curiosity and look round where, perhaps, it was not proper they should be. Indeed, I know two or three ladies went pretty much all over the house ; for Margaret has told me since Miss Bemis was in, in answer to some of my inquiries, that Mrs. Otis and Miss Drew asked her if they might not just look round a little. She said, too, they asked her a great many questions about my concerns, and she said, 'I thought, ma'am, they were real impudent.'             ! "Well, such things are really trying," Mrs. Davidsoni -20 *   234     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. observed; "but they will not detract in the least from the high estimation in which you are held by the good people of the parish." "No, I suppose not," Mrs. Eldridge said; "but, after all, these stories do have some etect. You know there are many families who seldom call here, and never see me only when I call upon them. These may have their prejudices excited against me by hearing such things said about my house appearing as Miss Bemis describes." "You have been here- too long a time to be injured in the least by these things," Mrs. Davidson said;" your character is too well established." "I hope you are correct," Mrs. Eldridge remarked; "but then I always am fearful that such stories havQ some effect to lessen the good opinion of one in relation to whom they are circulated. There are many people who only hear the fact; and they take it for truth, and never know to the contrary. From my experience and observation, I have found, that foolish and groundless reports of ministers' wives often do much towards prejudicing a people against their minister. I was at Mrs. Washburn's last fall, whose husband is settled in the next town to where my father lives, and she was complaining to me of what some of their people said in relation to herself and husband. She is not aovery robust lady, but yet one who is a most excellent wife and housekeeper ; and, because she is sometimes laid aside by sickness and has to rely entirely on hired help, the people say she is extravagant and it is no wonder that her husband can't live on his salary, or cannot study more, as he has so much to do in the care of his wife and chil- dren. She told me that her husband intended to be on the lookout for a new field of labor,; -because he was con- vinced that these stories were not only injuring his use- fulness, but likewise contributing to the prostration of her 'health."    THE PASTOR'S WIFE.       235 "You need not fear that any such result will follow the stories Miss Bemis' has been telling you, my dear friend,") said Mrs. Davidson. "I do think it was very unfeeling in her to come here with them." "O, it was; and when I considered that I was sick, and Hannah was sick likewise, and that we had a new girl, and there was so much to be done, I could not but weep most freely. If I had been well and the house had been, in confusion, I could have heard of it with more com- posure; but, as it was, I could .not help feeling it was almost barbarous in any one to feel like censuring me." "There are some people who never make any allowance for a minister's wife. I do not know why it is, but some people take great delight in seizing hold of almost any thing which they can convert to the disadvantage of one in your position," Mrs. Davidson observed. "The only way is, to do right and be indifferent to the sayings of such." "Miss Bemis told me people thought it very strange that we made our children work as they do. She said our daughters were confined in the house most of the time when they were not at school, and that our boys were very seldom seen out in the street in play with other boys." "I do not think persons have any right to interfere with the management of- your children," Mrs. Davidson said. "I wish all children were as well behaved and as promising as yours. I have often remarked to our friends that I thought your children were models, both in habits and conduct." "We are not indifferent to the observation of our friends of course," Mrs. Eldridge observed; "but our chil- dren are managed both by husband and, myself after our own convictions of duty. -We feel that it is very impor- tant that they acquire habits of industry, and that they   A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. learn to consider that they are to be sources of interest and pleasure to each other. Mr. Eldridge is very par- ticular to have employment for his sons, and I am no less so in regard to the daughters. It is not true that they are confined most of the time and that they do not mingle with other children; for we are anxiois to have them learn the ways of others; and, at suitable times and with proper companions, we have them go abroad." "I would not have you alter your mode of education," said Mrs. Davidson; "for I think it very judicious." "I do not think we shall, except for very good reasons," said Mrs. Eldridge. "We are governed by principle in the care of our children, and do not mind much about the gossip of the multitude in thaft regard." "Did Miss Bemis hint that your children were not well behaved ?" Mrs. Davidson asked.  "0, no ; she said they were- very promising children, and she wished every family of children was like themn." " Why, then, does she suggest that you alter in your mode of management? Perhaps if you did they would not be as promising as they now are," Mrs. Davidson remarked. "I should think she would be willing to have you go on in your usual course if she thought your children were more promising than those of others. I should think she was rather inconsistent." "I thought so likewise," Mrs. Eldridge said ; "and won- dered at the time how she could wigh us to do differently with our children, when she remarked every body said our daughters were little ladies and our sons littlegentle' men." "She is so ready to find fault and so eager to spread gossip, that I suppose she thought she must remark about your children, and make some suggestion to assist you in their education," Mrs. Davidson remarked. " She had much to say about tmy not being more abroad   in the parish. She said people thought I ought to be out more visiting the families," Mrs. Eldridge said. "Perhaps your house would be in confusion if you were visiting all the time ; and, if such were the case, I have no doubt people would say you ought to stay at home and at- tend to your fanily," Mrs. Davidson remarked. "That is all true," said Mrs. Eldridge. "I have no doubt, should I visit more than I now do, I should be un- der the necessity of neglecting my children and family; and then there would be a great hue and cry, and Miss Bemis would have more than her hands full of business. I told Miss Bemis that I visited all that I could, and always went when and where I thought my duty called, and that I intended to do this whilst I had health. I was pretty plain with her; and I do not think she will again allude to the subject. She has hinted to me often.before that I did not go abroad in the parish- enough ; but I never said much in reply till to-day." "I have often wondered," Mrs. Davidson said, "how you found time to visit as much as you did, seeing you had so much company and that your domestic cares were so numerous. I never hear people censure you for not visiting more, and I do not believe there are many who do. Miss Bemis may have heard some three or four per- sons say that you did not visit enough because you do not visit them more than others." "I thought the same," said Mrs. Eldridge, "and told Miss Bemis that I was particular, as a general thing, to distribute my visits equally among all classes in the parish."  "Yes, I know you are," said Mrs. Davidson; " and some- times I have felt sorry that you were so particular, be! cause your visits at our house are so infrequent." "If I visited any more often-than others, I think there are the best of reasons why I should be frequently at   238     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. your house; for your favors to us have been unbounded, and your sympathy and encouragement unfailing." "I do not know about'that," said Mrs. Davidson. "We have always taken great pleasure in doing what we have for you and your family, and it would have afforded me greater pleasure if you had visited us oftener. I do not think you call at our house much oftener than you do at other places.", "I know I do not; and the reason is, as you know, that I wish to avoid every cause of complaint," Mrs. El- dridge said, "Yes, I know it; and I suppose your course is proper. A minister and his wife must be prudent." O O, yes, we know that; but I have often thought that ;i  it was impossible for a minister or his wife to be so pru- dent as to escape censure from some quarter. Why is, itf that a minister's wife should be censured when she does precisely the same things which another lady does who is much applauded for her conduct? Now, there are certain ,courses which I havetaken-in relation to certain matters which have been, I acknowledge, in imitation of your con- duct, and I have very often heard you highly praised by the same individuals who, I am informed, have condemned me in no measured terms." Mrs. Davidson, smiling, remarked, "I have often thought in astonishment of the same inconsistency, and could not explain it in any other way than by supposing that you were a public character, a sort of target mark, and that I was a private individual. People feel that a minister and his wife are somewhat their property, and are dependent on them. Thus they take liberties which would be con- demned as exceedingly uncivil and uncourteous if prac- tised towards others." "I do not think there is any reason for such feeling," Mrs. Eldridge observed. "I do not know why we are   THr PASOtORt WIPE.       239 any mbre beholden to the people than the'doctors are or the lawyers. My husband works as hard for the people as any doctor in the place 'or any lawyer, and yet does not receive half the compensation for his services which these gentlemen obtain. I never heard that the people ever hinted that Dr. Brown or Squire Morton were de- pendent on them, or that they could not live without them,  or that their management or that of their wives was ever a subject of much conversation." "I agree with you," Mrs. Davidson said, "that no doc- tor or lawyer in the place works so hard for the people as your husband, and that none receives so small a compen- sation as Mr. Eldridge does. You know people regard the body and the will witl more esteem than they do the soul, and they are more ready to pay for services to the body than they are for those to the soul, and that they some- times will-sacrifice all to the gratification of the will. Somehow or other, people feel wheni they employ a doctor or a lawyer that they are dependent upon them, and not that the doctor or lawyer are beholden to them. But towards a minister the feeling of dependence is the other way." , Yes, I think it is,'": Mrs. Eldridge replied. "I do not think that I am any more beholden to the people here than Mrs. Brown or Mrs. Morton are. I wonder if these ladies think they are dependent and must stop and think before they act to ascertain whether it will answer to do thus and so, just because their husbands happen to be one a doctor and the other a lawyer?" "Of course they do not feel their dependence," said Mrs. Davidson. "I warrant you Mrs. BroWn will do as she pleases for all the people here will say; and that Mrs. Morton, too, will not ask leave of any how to act." "Well, low," Mrs. Eldridge asked, "why should my con- duct be so much watched, and why should people be so free to speak of me and my actions, when they let Mrs.   240     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. Brown and Mrs. Morton go unscathed? The people pay Dr., Brown and Squire- Morton, and: they pay Mr. El- dridge. The doctor and lawyer make money; but my husband barely lives. I should really like to know why I should be singled out and shot at as I am." "O, I do not know of any good reason, I confess," Mrs. kavidsonl remarked, "only that is the fashion. Ministers' wives, of late years, have had rather a hard lot; for my part, I pity them very much." "They are deserving?6f commiseration, I think," Mrs. Eldridge replied; "for often, let them do as they may,- suimmon to their aid all the wisdom which can be com- manded, - the are sure to meet with censure and reproach from some quarter."   CHAPTER XXI. VISIT OF MR. AND MRS. BANCROFT. A SUDDEN change in the health of Mrs. Davidson baving excited the apprehension of her friends that her days on earth would soon be finished, a messenger was despatched to her only surviving sister, Mrs. Bancroft, who resided in the State of New York, summoning her at once to the pres- ence of the invalid. But a few days, therefore, elapsed after the receipt of this most melancholy intelligence before the affectionate sisters again were together, the one in the most anxious and assiduous care of the other, who was far reduced by disease. In a few months later it had been the design of Mrs. Bancroft to visit the place of .her birth and the scenes of her childhood and youth; for it had ever been her practice since her marriage to do this as often as once in a twelve- month.- Her attachments were exceedingly strong to her native hills and valleys; and, with these, her affection for the only sister' she ever had made a motive altogether irresistible to overcome every hinderance which might interpose an annual journey thitherward. In the present instance of her leaving home there had been no pleasing anticipations as there formerly were for weeks before such a journey. But one idea was with her, and that engrossed every thought of her mind and absorbed every feeling of her heart. Her sister, her only sister, sick and dying, was 21           (241)   242     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. sufficient to keep her most thoughtful and sad. Upon her arrival, however, at the mansion of the squire, her melan- choly forebodings were much relieved; for in Mrs. David- son there had been an alteration for the better, and hope again existed in all the family that the period of her disso- lution might not soon arrive. A few days subsequent to the arrival of Mrs. Bancroft and her husband, as Mr. Eldridge had just left the chamber of the sick one, Mrs. Bancroft observed,- "How differently you are'situated in respect to a pastor, sister, from what we are All here seem attached to the minister; and the minister appears to reciprocate the interest, and to be devoted to the highest interests of the people." "We are highly favored in our pastor, I acknowledge," Mrs. Davidson replied. "Mr. Eldridge certainly is a most excellent man. I am sorry to know that you are not as fortunate in a pastor. Perhaps, however, it may be that your people are in fault, in not paying him those attentions which belong to a minister." "I cannot think," said Mrs. Bancroft, " that our minister knows howwto appreciate tender and devoted attentions from a people. He always appears to be looking after but one interest; and that is his own. I think, and others think, that he is a very selfish man." "I am astonished, sister," said Mrs. Davidson, " to hear such a character given to Mr. Caldor. When I have met with him at your house I have been rather pleased with him." "I know you were pleased with him," Mrs. Bancroft said, " as strangers are inclined to be. When you have been with us we did not care to disclose our feelings in regard to him and find fault with the minister; for we were aware of your very extreme repugnance at hearing a minister censured ; and besides, we have been living in hope   VISIT OP MR. AND MRS. BANCROFT.   243 that Mr. Caldor would become sensible of his inconsis- tencies, and reform. But now we have given up all hope of this." "You feel then," said Mrs. Davidson, "that he can no longer be useful to you, I suppose?" "Yes, I think Mr Caldor can do no more good in our parish. The council- e had a few months since gave it as their opinion that :it was best that he be dismissed." "Ah, have you had a council?"Mrs. Davidson inquired.    "Yes; the people at last obtained the consent of Mr. Caldor to the calling of a council; but he told them he should not abide by the result unless it accorded with his judgment." "He is somewhat independent, I should think," Mrs. Davidson said. "He is a very set man," said the other. "He is not the man to be moved when he has once made up his mind. His contumacy has been very instrumental in increasing the dissatisfaction of our people with him. If any one differs from him and conscientiously acts in opposition to his views, he is sure to hear of it, and sooner or later to feel the effects of Mr. Caldor's displeasure." "Such a trait of character," said Mrs. Davidson, " is not very becoming in a minister, I think." "No, sister; it very ill becomes a minister to condemn every one who happens to disagree with him and to follow such a one with his wrathful treatment. This is the course which Mr. Caldor has long pursued, and it has been a powerful cause in bringing our people to their present feeling." "Did it appear before the council," Mrs. Davidson inquired, " that Mr. Caldor was such a than as you rep- resent?" "Certainly it did," was the reply, " and that pretty fully too. The testimony was abundant that Mr. Caldor fol-   244     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. lowed such as walked not on his own line with his dis- pleasure and improved every opportunity to do them an injury. Some of the council were utterly confounded with the disclosures which were made under this charge, and they were amazed that the people had borne with him as long as they had. It 4-appeared that one man was turned out of the church because Mr. Caldor became angry with him forfnot quietly submitting to his arbitrary dictation." "But how could this have been done?"Mrs. Davidson inquired. "Our church have long been in a very sluggish state, you know," Mrs. Bancroft replied, " and withal have stood in fear of Mr. Caldor. They knew he would be a match for them if they contended with him; and so he has been allowed to do pretty much as he pleased. The brother who was cut off would not bow down to Mr. Caldor, and so at some private meeting of the church he was cut off." "Were there no preliminary steps taken with this indi- vidual?"Mrs. Davidson asked. "No; there were not. When- he was excommunicated ther were but a few present, and those were people who would not dare to do otherwise than as, Mr. Caldor told them." "I should have thought the brother would have appealed to a council," Mrs. Davidson suggested. "He did request a mutual council; but Mr. Caldor so managed that the request was refused. The people, how- ever, did not feel right about this; and, on the whole, more harm was done to Mr. Caldor than to any one else." "I should think," Mrs. Davidson said, "conduct like this in a minister would be likely to excite a people." - BYes, yes; it did our people, I assure you. They waked up at once after this," Mrs. Bancroft said, " and there was no backwardness in people's saying what they thought about Mr. Caldor. One would tell this and another that;   VISIT OF MR. AND MRS; BANCROFT.   245 and so from different quarters there came a variety of re- ports of his conduct, which made him appear in a very unministerial position. There was, soon after this, a de- termination on the part of many to exert themselves and have him dismissed." What charges did they bring against him before the council?"Mrs. Davidson inquired. "His being arbitrary and vindictive was one, and his being very penurious was another." "Perhaps he was only provident and frugal, and not penurious," Mrs. Davidson said. "O, but it came out most fully before the council," the sister exclaimed, "that he was exceedingly fond of money, and would do almost any thing to get it. It appeared that he hacd driven some of the very hardest of bargains, and that often with the poor of his flock. There being no cause for this, Mr. Caldor having a good farm, money at interest, and a good salary, his conduct appeared much more reprehensible. As a specimen of his love of money   and of the meanness he often resorted to to get it, it was proved before the council that a poor neighbor of his went'to him to buy a rooster, of which he had many large and fine ones. The pastor was very coinplaisant and ready for a bargain, and descanted largely upon the su- periority of his poultry. A fowl having been selected by the neighbor and the price inquired, Mr. Caldor said, 'That's a noble fellow. It is not more than two months old, and I  dare say he would weigh five' pounds dressed. I will sell him to you for fifty cents ; and if you can't pay for him now, you may take him home  and keep him all winter, and return him in the spring.' The neighbor said he would not take him then, but would see about it, and let Mr. Caldor know  in a few days what he would do. This conversation took place towards the close of a day in the month of September.' In the evening a knocking 21*    246     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. was heard at the door lof this neighbor, and, on its being opened, lo and;l, behold, :there stood the pastor with the fowl under :his i'^'arm!f 'i have brought over the fowl,' he said. ' Mr. Bradly, he is rather in my way; he fights the others. You can kep'lhifl,':arind, any time you please, can pay me the half dollar.' '^The neighbor had concluded that he would not give such a price for the fowl, and was intending to have told his minister so when he next saw him; bfit, inasmuch as his reverence had brought him over in his own arms, he said, 'Very well, Mr. Caldor.' So he took the fowl. A few weeks after this Mr. Bradly went over to the minister's, and, after being there a while, he took out half a dollas and laid it upon the table by the side of which Mr., Caldor was sitting, and remarked, ' There is your rooster.' -/' said his reverence, 'I can't let you have him for that; he is worth seventy-five cents. I sold three to-day smaller than yours for that sum.' Upon being reminded that this was the price agreed upon, Mr. Caldor said, 'If I told you so, you can have it; but the fowl is worth more money.' " "Do you say, sister, that it was proved before the coun- cil that Mr. Caldor was guilty of this meanness and dis- honesty?" "I do," the sister persisted ; ",and several other cases similar were proved too. -It came out that Mr. Caldor had been in the habit of taking his wife and three small children and going abroad in the parish, spending a day here and one there, and being thus absent from his own house for three and four days in succession; and all this for the mere purpose of savings. "How could it be proved that this was his object? I should think it would be a difficult matter to prove this," Mrs. Davidson suggested. "What other object could the man have," the sister said, "in being gone from home with his wife and children   VISIT OF MR. AND MRS. BANCROFT,    i i from Monday afternoon till FridYmornig, and that, too, very frequently in the courseo,l sat-lht-et B;idBesids, it was proved that saving was histio;et gaie l.   This girl testified that she overyiar:. M C3aldor say to his wife one day,' My dear, Ig!we'll go abroad  in the parish next week and live on!:the people for a few days. Mary takes good care of the hogs and the cows when we are away; and you know she likes bread and, milk, and it saves considerable when we are all away for three or four days.'  "t How happened it to be known that Mr. Caldor said this?"Mrs. Davidson inquired ,      / ' The hired girl, Mary, told of it, to be sure," he sister replied. "She never liked it to be left alone so much with all the barn work to do; and she was vexed when she came to know what the reason was. After hearing this reason from the lips of Mr. Caldor himself, she made it known to some of the neighbors. The people had often wondered why the minister and his family were abroad so much in the parish, and many had said that they could think of no other reason than a desire to save; but then there was no proof of this until the disclosures of the hired girl." "Well," said Mrs. Davidson, " if your minister is such a man as this, I can't blame the people for wishing him away.' "He is just such a man," was the reply; "and I hope there are few like him who preach the gospel." "I think there are not many of this description," Mrs. Davidson said. "Our acquaintance with ministers is very large, you well know; and I am sure, as a general thing, they are sincere, worthy men, whose chief desire is to do good. I have often thought that a desire for money, for its own sake, existed more feebly in clergymen than in any other class of the community."   248     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "That has always been my opinion," rejoined the sister; "and I think that Mr. Caldor's is one of the rare cases of ministerial misconduct. But then it is all true of him that I have now told; and I think he ought no longer to preach. If he were poor there would be some excuse for him; but, he is not; he is richer than most of his people." "I hope most sincerely," Mrs. Davidson continued, " that he will be influenced by the advice of the council and take himself off from your parish without further trouble." "I am very much afraid that he will not," said Mrs. Bancroft. "He very well knows that he would stand but a small chance to- be settled again; and he likes a six- hundred-dollar salary too well to relinquish it readily. But I am persuaded, if he stays, that he will have but a very few people to hear him preach. He may, however, take himself off. Should he do this at once the parish may be saved from ruin." "But can he not be compelled to leave?"Mrs. David- son asked. "They say he is settled for life," was the reply;" and unless he can be impeached for immoral conduct, or change of sentiment, or neglect of duty, he cannot be dismissed against his consent. That was in the contract at the time of his settlement." "I should say that he might be impeached for immoral conduct," Mrs. Davidson suggested. ' So some of the council thought," the sister said ; " and I believe there are those among the people who intend to resort to this course if he will not leave soon." "I cannot understand how a minister can be willing to preach to a people who has the opinion of him which you say is held by your parish respecting Mr. Caldor," Mrs.   VISIT OF MBR. AND MRS. BAN(OROFT.  249 Davidson said. "Most clergymenwould} refre at once upon the discovery of any very gener-t iissatisfaction, no matter whether there was anyv reason for- it or not. I have often thought, that they were too much inclined to leave their people upon very slight appearances of dissat- isfaction among them. I have supposed ministers often erred in thinking their people were tired of them without cause." "I have no doubt of this, sister, myself. I think, and have often heard the opinion expressed by others, that ministers were too sensitive and too suspicious. I have known instances :of ministers leaving good situations, thinking that their people were anxious for a change. There was Mr. Parsons, who was settled about fifteen miles from us, who left his people because he imagined they were dissatisfied. They did not know at the time that this was the reason; and- they were much pained when convinced that such was the fact. They thought much of him, and never thought that he was not a very useful minister amtong them." "I have no doubt that ministers often err in this re- spect," said Mrs. Davidson. "They see things frequently through a diseased brain, brought on by much study Ed anxiety. I think a people ought to take especial pins to guard their pastor against such a feeling, which might be easily done. Let them often call upon the pas- tor and speak words of cheer to him--speak of his ser- mons and his other labors, to encorage him. How easily this might be done I Let them, to;, make him or his fam- ily a present :occasionally--no matter if it be ever so small and trifling, if a larger one be not convenient and practicable. ' A gift,' you know, 'pacifieth wrath ;' and certainly a gift might have equal effect in removing despondency and in sending encouragement to a pastor's heart."   250     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE, "Yes, sister; what you say is all true. Not long since I went a short journey, and stopped over the Sabbath with a friend of -ours, a Mr. Branch, who is settled over a large church. -I remember very well hearing him say to his wife that he wished he might hear something from his preaching. I asked him if he never heard any thing from it. 'No,' he said; he did not remember ever to have heard any allusion made to his sermons more than once or twice since he had been settled. He remarked that he considered it very'singular that, as often as he met his people in private, they should be so silent in re- lation to his labors. He said it would do hitn good to hear from his preaching; he should be encouraged, be in- spired with confidence, if he knew that his people were satisfied with his preaching." "That is just what I think," said Mrs. Davidson. "AL minister is greatly encouraged when he hears his people speak favorably of his labors. He feels -that he is not laboring in vain. I think a people err often in being negligent in this respect. A little more consideration on their part might show them the usefulness and importance of their encouraging their pastor. Should they do this, and pay him kind attentions, they might be paid a hun- dred fold. People are ready enough to talk to their minister about his sermons and other labors when he is first settled and does not need encouraging. I would have them as communicative ever afterwards. We all like to feel that we are successful in what we undertake; and it must be grati ing to a clergyman to hear from his people evidence that he is useful. I am acquainted with no better way for a minister to have this evidence than for his people to speak to him occasionally about his sermons." "Yes, sister; if a people wishfor a good minister, the best   VISIT OF MR. AND MRS. BANCROFT.   251 way is for them to be good themselves. - They must treat him kindly and considerately. If thiey do this, and have not such a man as our Mr. Caldor for a pastor, I am per- suaded they will be rewarded for all their pains and trouble."   CHAPTER     XXII. THE REQUEST. IT accorded well with the feelings of Mr. Eldridge that an invitation was given him to preach the sermon at an ordination of a friend who was to-be settled about ninety miles distant from him; for, at the period when this invi- tation came, he was exhausted by his multifarious pastoral labors, and longed for a journey to recruit him. He therefore willingly consented to perform the service, and left his family and parish towards the close of the week preceding the Wednesday on which the ordination was to occur. He left thus early that he might pass a few days with a much-esteemed clerical friend, who lived about fifteen miles this side the town which was to terminate his journey. In his visit at this friend's, conversation was directed, as was perfectly natural that it should be, to the situation of ministers at the present day and as it had been for a number of past years. In the progress of this conver- sation the pastor of the place incidentally alluded to a letter which had lately been put into his hands by one of his most promnient parishioners, with a desire for his opin- ion on the request which it contained. This letter was from  a son who had received a liberal education, had passed through a regular theological course, and entered the ministry, in which he had been blessed for nine years, (2,52)   THE REQUEST.        258 serving two churches suceessively inthe pastoral office. In point of ability and general acceptableness as a preacher he was far above the ordinary class. He had his own ideas of propriety, and could not well be happy or conteanted in-a sit- uation where such views could tot be realizedand enjoyed. Because this was not this condition in his first charge he sought and obtained a, release from it, thinking he might, among another people, be differently situated. Such was his popularity as a preacher, he found it no difficult matter soon to secure an invitation from another pamish ; and the compensation being more than that usually given out of our cities for ministerial services, he concluded to accept the invitation, and was accordingly installed. Among this people he had lived four years at the time he wrote the letter to his father to which allusion has been made, and was happy in their confidence and esteem; yet here he found that his own ideas of propriety were not, met, and it was his serious purpose to leave. The letter was read to Mr. Eldridge, and it was as fol- lows : - "MY DEAR FATHER: From, what I said to you when you were there six months since,- the impression was proba- bly made on your mind that we were not happy and con- tented- here, and for ;reasons somewhat similar to those which occasioned my first dismission. - In my first- settle- ment, I had a salary, as you remember, of five hundred dollars. I soon found, as you are aware, that such a sum was wholly inadequate to a comfortable living and yet meet those other calls made upon me from my library and the benevolent societies of the age.. Were I -not-a minis- ter and expected to be an example to the flock of benevo- lence, and to have all things upon and about me fair and comely, and expected, too, not to resort to other ways than my regular salary for the means of enabling i 22    254 o   A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. the people to realize their expectations, were I a farmer or a mechanic, I doubt not I could live comfortably on five hundred dollars, and perhaps put by a hundred on interest. But being a minister, I could not, as you know I did not, live- on five hundred -dollars in one of the five years of myfirst settlement; and it was for this reason only that I sought a dismission. When I was invited to settle where I am. now located, and offered one thousand dollars salary, I judged I might fulfil my desires- and duty sn that amount; but I have not been able. The expenses-of living here are great; the expectations of the people- of the style in which their minister is to live are great; and a thousand dollars here go no further towards answering the many calls made upon the pastor than five hundred did in my former settlement. Had I no more family now than I had then, I could not live and do as I am expected to do on the salary I nowthave. Now, I am troubled, and have long been troubled, to know what course to pursue. My people think they pay a 'large salary; and so they do, if a large salary be more than what most ministers in the country receive. But, then, it is not a salary sufficient to enable a minister to maintain the position in society which is assigned him by the people. Here is my trouble. People assign a minister a position which the salary they give him will not enable him tO keep; whereas he ought to have a larger salary than his position demands to be able to provide against a season of disability to preach by reason of sickness and age; as the community now feel a minister cannot be backward in any benevolent effort without incurring the charge of meanness, nor can he be economical and save a portion of his salary without an exposure to the charge of being avaricious. I have neighbors about me, whose in- come has nQver been a thousand dollars a year, who are comparatively wealthy; but if the minister had attempted to follow their way of becoming rich he would have been ?*      .     v   THE BEQUEST. *       255 most severely frowned upon. I am tired of drawing on you and on my wife's father for money from year to year to help in maintaining my position in society; and both myself and wife have made up our minds that it is no longer duty. My wife's father was here lately, and we had a long talk upon the subject. tHe sympathizes with us, and is willing to assist us in living here, and would pre- fer thus to do than to have us leave. :We-told him how we felt in relation to being supported in any-other way than from our own exertions, and that we hbad -made up our mind no longer to be from year to year dependent on the bounty of our relatives. At last I disclosed to him mny plan, which I will now submit to you. "When I first proposed to you the idea I had of trying to obtain a - collegiate education, you may remember that you did not fully fall in with me; that you said you intended that I should have the Holmes Place, which you thought would afford me the means of obtaining a hand- some livelihood and perhaps more than that. Well, that place is not sold yet, and I have thought I would apply for it now. I think I could live if I had it, and- not suffer so much as I now do from being pinched as I am- in living on a scale not of my own making, which I am not able to sustain with the means now afforded me by the people. I cannot hope for an increased salary, nor that the people will be less moderate in their expectations. I do not like to live where I cannot be more independent in the manage- ment of my affairs than I can in the ministry in the pres- ent state of popular feeling. A minister, ordinarily, is not permitted to graduate his expenses according to his own estimate of his ability. His people or the- ruling spirits among them must do this workfor him; and, whilst the means of living according to such graduation are with- held, I cannot longer, with a good -conscience, submit,. I think the influence is pernicious. If now, my dear father,   256     A VOICEi FROM. THE PARSONAGE. you think favorable of this plan of mine, and will let me have the Holmes Plaoe, I sha1 abandon the pastoral office and seek a living from the cultivation of the soil. You know- I always was a good farmer; and I think I can suc- ceed well now in the business. My wife's father gen- erously offered to give us two thousand dollars to repair the house and stock the farm. "Should I do this, and have the pastoral office, it is not my intention to abandon the ministry. Far from this. I could supply feeble churches for what- they were able to pay, and I doubt not could make myself useful in preach- ing. This I should aim to accomplish. I am hoping to be with you in a few weeks, when we can confer together.,' "There is much truth in that letter," Mr. Eldridge re- marked, "and many considerations deserving profound attention, I confess; but T do not know that a minister would be justified in leaving the pastoral office for the reasons set forth in this letter. I should wish to think and pray much over the smatter before I came- to such a decision." "The brother w-ho wrote this letter, I can assure you, is no ordisnary man," Mr. Pearson remarked.. "He is far above mediocrity as a ,preacher, and has always mani- fested a spirit of the most :fervent piety and devotedness to his profession. I never knew any thing of the feeling this letter discloses until I read it. I supposed my young friend was happy and contented in his work." "I know the amount a -minister receives :for his com- pensation does not answer the same purpose for the bene- fit of his family which the same sum would accomplish for almost any other family in the parish," Mr. Eldridge ob- served. "He is expected to- do more for the public in various ways than, other men; and he must regulate his expenses with his eye on the accommodation ane:good iof   THE REQUEST.         257 others. It is expected that a minister will- always enter- tain a certain class of strangers who happen to be in the parish; and then he must lead olff, often, if not always, subscriptions for all the, benevolent objects of the day; whereas, if he were in private life, he could;ma-ke his own selection of the objects of hischarity, or, if he judged it duty, withhold giving altogether. Besides, his own dress and that of his family must be more expensive; and, indeed, all his family expenses are necessarily more than what they would be if he was not the minister of the par- ish and expected to please every body." "This subject," remarked Mr. Pearsoni, "enlarges the more it is considered, I confess. I do not know as I ever thought so much of it until lately; and I really think our churches do not realize as they might and should the difference between the expenses incident to the support of a minister's family and position in life and those of a private citizen. All the agents who plead the cause of our benevolent societies, of course, make the minister's house their home ; -and then, again, if they would succeed well in their different objects, the minister must head the sub- scription paper. He must do all this if he has not paid for his last suit of clothes or for his winter's wood ; and so he is subjected to great anxiety in relation to such ex- penses, and meets them only by the most rigid economy."  "Yes, yes," said 'Mr. Eldridge; "it- must be acknowl- edged a minister has a hard time of it at the best,: let his salary be what it may. A people will find some way to make it not, worth so much to him as the same amount would be were he in private life." "I have been thinking," remarked Mr. Pearson, "of going to visit the father of the-,young man who wrote this letter, after dinner to-day, and would be pleased to have you accompany me. Perhaps from us both he maythe able to obtain some satisfaction as to his duty in Welation 22    1;8    A VOICE PROM tAHE PARSONAGE. to the request of his son. It may be the son is there; and if so, we shall -have an opportunity of learning from him more of his own trials." After dinner the two gentlemen proceeded to the house ,of Mr. Mosely, which was a ride of about two miles. Having reached th6 place and entered the house, they were very cordially welcomed by Mrs. Mosely and her daughters, and soon by Mr. Mosely himself, who was summoned from the field to be gratified and entertained by a visit from his pastor and clerical friend. After indulging a while in general conversation, Mr. Mosely, addressing Mr. Pearson, inquired what he thought of the letter from his son. "I have attentively read the letter," Mr. Pearson-re- marked, " and must confess there is too much reason for the feeling which prompted your son to write it; yet I -cannot bear to think that he must leave the pastoral office." "I don't want him to do this," replied the father; "it tries me very much; but I think there is some ground for his being dissatisfied with the manner in which he is obliged to lay out his salary, unless he has more than at present." 'Have you heard from him lately?" Mr. Pearson in- quired. "He is at home," was the reply. "He arrived yester- day, but is now gone to' the village. We expect him back, however, very soon." "Does he seem to be persuaded to follow out the plan detailed in the letter?"Mr. Eldridge asked. "I should think he did," Mr. Mosely answered. "He says he cannot live any longer and be supported by chari- ty, or feel that he cannot expend his earnings after the promptings of his own judgment, and be ruled by the caprice and pride of a people."   THE REQUEST.        659 "Then you have decided to accede. to his wishes," Mr. Pearson remarked, " and we shall have him among:us?" "Yes," Mr. Mosely replied. "If he really thinks it best i shall gratify him, and let him have the Holmes Place. -There, he has come, I believe,'" rising and looking out of the window at the carriage approaching the house. Mr. Mosely, the son, soon made his appearance in the parlor, where this conversation was going on ; and, after the- usual inquiries and salutations, he remarked, - "I don't know, Mr. Pearson, but that you will have some new parishioners soon." "Yes, said the latter; " from what has been said since I came in, I have thought it probable; but I do not know as I ought to have just such parishioners as it is intimated I may have." "Dismissed ministers, they say, make bad parishioners, I know," said the young clergyman; " but if I come home to live, I hope there will be no trouble from me." "O, I did not make my last remark," Mr. Pearson said, "because I apprehended any trouble from the family who contemplate occupying the Holmes Place, I assure you. I have no doubt both our parish and myself would be much advantaged by such an accession to our number. I am not yet fully persuaded that duty would be done if Mr. Mosely should become a parishioner." "Well, sir," said Mr. Mosely, "I have thought very much on this subject, and have most sincerely and pain- fully regretted the necessity of such a step, but have about made up my mind to take it. To live as I have lived since I have been settled in the ministry I cannot ny longer, and so I must live if I continue a pastor; for I do not think I could effect, any difference in public sen- ;iment in relation to the compensation of ministers which would bring me any relief. Now, I have what is called a arge salary-one thousand dollars a year. I know it is   260     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. difficult to make people believe that I cannot live handsomely on that sum; but I have tried to live, and have not been able to make the two ends of the year meet. Now, I will tell you how my money goes. My house rent -is two hundred and fifty dollars. I am obliged to keep two girls, whom I pay two hundred and fifty more, besides their board. My parish being large and out of the village, somewhat scattered, places me under the necessity of keeping a horse, and that costs me one hundred and fifty dollars more; so my house, hired help, and horse cost me six hun- dred and fifty dollars: then there are but three hundred and fifty dollars left for food, clothing, books, and inci- dental expenses. Now, you may ask, ' Why have such an expensive house, and why keep two girls?' I will tell you. My people, or the ruling spirits among them, RE- QUIRE- me to live, where I do ; and the house being large, more help is required to keep it in order. My wife must be a lady, or the parish would rebel ; she must visit and be ready to receive calls; and so two girls are absolutely needed. The second year after I was settled in my present place I resolved that I would take a cheaper house, and thus reduce my rent and other expenses. I partly en- gaged a suitable house abdut a mile out of the village, where I could have been contented and happy; but when it came to be known that I was thinking of moving there, there was such a clamor about it from certain quarters that I and my best friends thought it would not be prudent to move. Had I gone there, I could have saved all of three hundred dollars annually." "If such be the expenditures you are obliged to make from year to year," Mr. Eldridge observed, "for house, help, and a horse, I do not see -how you could meet the other calls made upon you with three hundred and fifty dollars; and I do not think I should feel very comfortable in being under the necessity of calling upon relations to make up to   THE REQUEST.         261 me the amount needed to make the two ends of the year meet. I should want my people to understand the matter; and perhaps they would either give more salary or be willing to have me live within that they now pay." "Well," Mr. Mosely said, "a people are governed by custom in offering a salary to a minister. Most ministers have about the same amount which is paid in their com- munity, and regard is not had so much to the necessities of a astor's family as to custom. A religious society would OtI be willing to pay less to a minister than what other religious societies of their own ability in the neighborhood pay; nor would one be very likely to advance -much on what their neighbors give. There ought to be taken into account the difference of expenses between living in one parish or another; but -such difference is apt to be over- looked ; and it is thought that, because a neighboring minister gets along well on a certain sum, another minister might do the same in a parish where the expenses of living are double, arising from the habits of the people among whom he lives in part. I have talked with my people on the subject, and they say when I talk with them it ought not so to be; that I ought to have more salary; but somehow or other it is difficult to bring them to feel so intensely on the subject as to induce them in their parish capacity to act. Talking in the parlor or in private, private sympathy with a pastor, is a very different thing from a parish vote to relieve a pastor. My people, whilst they say to me pri- vately that my present salary is insufficient, would not in parish meeting say this. Should I ask more salary, I might possibly get it; but then it would be the occasion of ill feeling that might lurk secretly in the bosoms of the people for a while, and in a few years be the means of an open rupture.  I shall not ask for an increase of salary. I think I must leave my people, and thus leave, too, the pastoral office."   262     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGE. "I do not like the plan of asking for an increase of salary," Mr. Pearson remarked, "In ninety cases 'out of a hundred it is disastrous; and as brother Mosely says, whilst people privately say what they now pay is insuffi- cient, yet they would not raise their hands and advocate earnestly in parish meeting for an increase of salary. I do not know how to reconcile the expression of private sympathy from parishioners towards a pastor with inac- tivity in their parish capacity to afford relief, unless it be that the parish think the pastor will some way or other elbow his way out of his embarrassments." 4' That's it, father Pearson," said Mr. Mosely. "Now, my people think that I shall elbow my way out as I have always done, with" the help of my father and my wife's father; and here is the sore place. I cannot bear it; and it is my duty to prevent it. I do not think a parish ought to-be encouraged in having their minister supported by his friends who live out of the parish. There is brother Parker, settled near me among a people who are abun- dantly able to support him handsomely; and yet they think that, because his wife has rich friends in Boston and New York who make them many valuable presents, it is no matter if they do not pay him more than four hundred dollars a year, and even that sum most reluctantly and tardily. I am tired and sick of these things, and I really think our churches ought to be brought by some means or other to alter and to do very differently.' "Well, how would you effect the revolution you de- sire?"Mr.?Eldridge inquired. "You see what I am intending to do," Mr. Mosely re- plied. "I would have these churches who will not pay a pastor a sufficient 'sum to enable him to live go without a pastor, be compelled to go without a pastor, until they are ready to do their duty. Now, my people pay me   THE REQUEST.        263 enough, provided they would allow me to expend my sal- ary as they would expend a thousand-dollars a year." As this remark was finished some new company was in- troduced, and further conversation on this topic was inter- rupted. It may be remarked, however, that the Holmes Place was fitted up and handsomely stocked with all need- ful implements of a wqll-cared-for farm, and that the Rev. Mr. Mosely there happily lived, meeting all the expenses of his numerous family from its productions. A weak and worthy parish in the neighborhood for a long time had his ministrations, till, through the strength derived from his wisdom and care, with the blessing of God upon his labors, they were able to sustain a pastor. Though not in the pastoral office, the ministry of Mr. Mosely continues useful and acceptable, *R   CHAPTER    XXIII. A MODEL PARISH. WHLST Mr. Eldridge was passing a vacation at the west his good wife and children were making a visit to the place of her nativity, the home of her parents. Whilst there she received a letter from one of her female friends proposing to her an excursion of about fifty-five miles, and promising to introduce her to a parish which would afford her real pleasure. This parish had often been described in the correspondence which had for many years existed between the two friends, and Mrs. Little had frequently intimated to Mrs. Eldridge that she hoped one day to have it in her power to visit there in her company. The incumbent of the pastoral office in this parish was an uncle of Mrs. Little's, and had been settled something like forty years, enjoying the pleasing satisfaction of minister- ing to the spiritual necessities of his people from divine truth and of witnessing many full and extensive harvests. So much had been written to her of this parish that Mrs. Eldridge- had a strong desire to visit it; and though the invitation to do so now came to her when she was alike absent from her husband and their home, yet she could not find-it-in her heart to deny herself the pleasure of responding favorably to the offer ; and she accordingly wrote to Mrs. Little that she would gladly avail herself of her generous proposal and be in readiness to meet her at the depot, a (264)    A MODEL PARISH.       265 few miles from her father's residence, on the day she speci- fied. -Accordingly) the next week, on the appointed day, Mrs. Eldridge was accompanied by her father to the place where the cars would bring Mr. and Mrs. Little on their way to the abode of the honored pastor and the respected and beloved uncle in whose family and from whose people great pleasure had often been experienced in days that were gone. After waiting at the depot about half an hour, the iron horse was seen at a distance o n the road that had but a few years been opened in the long woods of pine, and soon he came up with mighty majesty, and at length stopped for wood, water, and passengers. The train had hardly stopped before Mr. Little was on the depot platform by the side of Mrs. Eldridge and her father, with a smiling face and ready hands, to assist a most valued friend of his wife to a seat in the cars which had been kept vacant for her occupancy, in close proximi- ty to Mrs. Little, that they might at once enter on that pleasure, long anticipated, which friends strongly attached always experzence when they meet after a long separation. The baggage was quickly located in its appropriate place, the aged father's hand was quickly pressed, a good by was hastily uttered, "All aboard i " was quickly shouted, and then the iron horse was off, and with lightning speed was soon beyond the reach of the old man's vision. As soon as the conversation began to run on quiet themes, after the many incidentals to a sudden meeting of old friends, Mrs. Eldridge remarked,- "I hardly know what my husband will say when he finds me absent from my father's." "When is he expected there?"Mrs. Little inquired. "This- week, Saturday," Mrs. Eldridge replied. "I should have written and informed him of this excursion had. I known where he was; but, as he was unsettled which course to take when he last wrote, I did not know 23   266     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. where to direct a letter with any certainty that it would find him. I left a letter for him at father's, explaining my position, and saying that I should not be absent more than four or five days." Mrs. Little smiled'and said, - "I rather think your husband will have to wait longer than that before he will have the pleasure of seeing his wife. We intend staying at uncle's ten days or a fort- night." At this remark Mrs. Eldridge was overtaken with pain- ful surprise, and quickly said, - "I cannot possibly remain so long. Husband's vacation is up in three weeks, and he wished to return home by the way of New York city and stop and see some friends on the route. Besides, there are a number of places in the vicinity of father's where we intended to visit; and it will be impossible for me to be absent for ten days now.' "Perhaps you may think it best to remain with us,' Mrs. Little remarked. ( We want to have you do so, for we tlinkl you would never regret it. Your husband, I guess, would not object to a week's addition to his vaca- tion. It is so terrible hot he won't do much before the middle of September." "O, but he engaged to be at home on the first Sabbath in next month," Mrs. Eldridge said. "The committee only provided for the supply of his pulpit till that time." "Well, my good friend," Mrs. Little said, " when we get to uncle's and find that we cannot spare you for a fort- night, I will write to a young minister of my acquaint- ance and engage him to supply your husband's pulpit at my expense till he returns." This kind offer somewhat relieved t anxiety of Mrs. Eldridge, and she thought that it might t be attended with any serious consequences if one or t o weeks were added to her husband's absence, provided the parish did not   A aMODEL PARIRSH.      267 have to bear the expense of supplying the pulpit. Indeed, Mr. Eldridge had intimated to some of his people that, if any thing should detain him into-the month of Septem- ber, he would arrange himself for the supply of his desk. The mind of Mrs. Eldridge being thus relieved of its anxiety, she soon found herself in animated conversation with her friends on various themes that naturally came up both from past associations and events, and objects which were of more recent date. The country, too, through which they were passing brought her in contact with many places where lived friends both to herself and Mrs. Little; and conversation naturally ran at times in rela- tion to these individuals. After a ride of about two hours and a half in the cars their mode of conveyance was changed to a stage coach, in which they proceeded about nine miles, to the residence of Mrs. Little's uncle. This place they reached about five o'clock in the afternoon, and were most cordially welcomed both by the uncle and aunt as well as by the cousins. As these visitors entered the house and were proceeding to the parlor, the eye of Mrs. Eldridge observed in the opposite room a new roll of carpeting half spread on the 'floor, and one or two ladies anxiously looking on as if in perplexity how to arrange the figures so as to have the carpet well and properly cut. She thought the one that was already on the floor was a very comely covering, and it was a matter of a little wonderment to her that a new carpet was thought to be necessary. However, it was but a passing thought, as such thoughts on otherpeople's con- cerns will come unbidden at times and are soon forgotten. Mrs. Eldridge soon found herself seated in a very hos- pitable family and surrounded by those-who sought to make her happy. At the tea table, which was surrounded in about an hour atfter their arrival, Mrs. Little, who sat at the right   A VOICE FROM THEI PARSONAGE. hand of her aunt Howe, in a whisper remarked to her rel- ative,- "I see a piece of carpeting in the corner of the room. You wear out carpets as well as other people, don't you, aunt?" "O, yes," the good lady audibly replied ; "but then we are not now in need of a new carpet for this room." A little blackeyed girl of about seven years, who sat next to Mrs. Little, a granddaughter of Mrs. Howe, with a blushing cheek and a most interested countenance, quick- ly remarked,- "That carpet is a present. The carpet that is on this room is going to be put on grandpa's new study floor." All at the table were now fully informed of another act of generosity of the people of the parish, when Mr. Howe proceeded to give his friends a little further account. "You know, Mary," he said, turning to Mrs. Little, ( that I have for a number of years been thinking of build- ing a study at the south-east corner of our house; and this summer I have accomplished my long-cherished plan. It was completed about a week since. Before it was done, some of the good ladies here whispered to y our aunt that, if it would be agreeable, some of our friends in the parish would like to do something about furnishing it. So they came and talked over the matter here, and finally con- cluded, as the carpet on this room had been in wear about two years, they would remove it to the study and put a new one in its place. So this morning, a valuable new carpet was sent in, and this afternoon several ladies have been in to cut and make it." "Your people hold out yet, it seems, in their kind and generous acts," -Mr. Little observed. "I wish my people had a better minister," Mr. Howe replied; "for a better parish cannot be found." As the remark was finished the door bell rang, and Mr.   Howe was called to the parlor. He however quickly returned, followed by a brother clergyman of a neighbor- ing parish, who was soon seated with the family at the table. The afternoon following the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Little, at six o'clock, was. the weekly prayer meeting in the vestry by the side of the meeting house, that stood on the common, directly in front of the parsonage. It was a most pleasant act 'on the part of their visitors to accept the invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Howe to accompany them to this hallowed place. Whilst they were participating in these services a most joyful surprise entered the hearts of these occasional guests. Such surprise, in part, was ex- cited by the large number in attendance and by the readi- ness of the brethren to take part .in the exercises, and the intelligence and piety they manifested whilst thus doing. So deeply were they impressed with this uncommon spec- tacle that they could not resist the inclinationoto make it the subject of many inquiries and pass many encomiums on their return to the parsonage. When they were all seated in the parlor, Mrs. Eldridge with great interest asked Mr. Howe,- "Do you always have so full an attendance at your weekly prayer meetings?" "In pleasant weather there are always as many, and often a much larger number out," Mr. Howe replied. "It speaks well for the people, I confess," Mrs. El- dridge remarked, "to be so much interested in these meetings."                : . "I think it does," Mr. Howe observed. "It is a great source of encouragement to me." "O, it must be," said Mrs. Eldridge; "it must elncour- age and comfort you very much." "My people are a very good people, and I have reason to bless God for sending me here," Mr. Howe remarked. 23  * \  '  270     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "I could wish that many parishes might follow their ex.- ample. Were it followed, there would doubtless be more fervent piety in our churches and greater stability in our ministry. It would not, moreover, be a difficult matter to follow such an example, if the members of our churches were interested as they ought to be in the great things of eternity." "They must find it difficult sometimes, I should think, to be present," Mrs. Eldridge observed. "Undoubtedly they do," Mr. Howe said " but not so difficult as one might at first suppose. The members of our church know that it is a fixed fact that there will be a weekly prayer meeting, and they generally know and feel that it is their most sacred duty to be present. I believe they wish to be present. Accordingly, they arrange their business so as not to have it interfere with the prayer meet- ing. Many of our brethren follow marketing at a neigh- boring village, where there are many factories. Some are obliged to go every day. But, then, those who are under obligation to send produce every day contrive on the day of our prayer meeting to be at home -in season to come to the vestry; and others,-who are not obliged to go every day, arrange it so that they will not go down thie day of our meeting." Whilst Mr. Howe was thus speaking' a smile might be seen on the very interested countenance of Mr. Little, who improved the first opportunity to remark,- "I think it would do one of our deacons good to come and pass a little time here ; do you not, wife?" "O husband, I would not reflect on any of our friends at home," Mrs. Little remarked. "We"ll," Mr. Little said, "I do like to see consistency of conduct, and I think the people here manifest this, and I thoqght one of our deacons might be profited by passing a few weeks up here." "How so?" Mr. Howe inquired.   A MODEL PARISH.       271 "We have a deacon,"' Mr. Little observed, "who gave very good evidence of piety and was for a number of years a very engaged Christian; but latterly he is very much troubled with a, diseased stomach, so much so as to be unable to be punctual in his attendance on prayer meetings- and on Sabbath services, for that matter. He works hard, is out in all weathers; and if there happens to be an auction, or any other gathering, on the day of a prayer meeting, his diseased stomach is not apt to be in the way of his being present; but, somehow or other, his disorder works curiously at about the hour of prayer meet- ing; he has to lie by then; he can hardly stir. If, how- ever, his business calls him ten or twelve miles from home the next day,--no matter if he must be at this distance by sunrise, - he is sure to be there. He gets pretty well worn down by Saturday night, and his disorder is very apt to be violent on the -Sabbath; so that he is not at church more than half the time. - I really think, if he could only come up here and inhale this atmosphere, he might soon be an altered man. I wish he would; for he is want- ed down our way for a deacon, and, if his health was good, he might do extensive good." "Does this deacon excuse himself fromn attending your prayer meetings and on the Sabbath by alleging .his dis- eased stomach, when he will not allow such reason to detain him from his business?"Mr. Howe inquired. "O, sometimes, when business is not very driving, he is troubled- with his disease," Mr. Little said; " but it is amusing to see how convenient it is for him to have this disease when we have our prayer meetings and on Sun- days. I have no doubt the deacon is somewhat diseased ; but, then, if he was now what he once was, he would: iot let his disease detain him from our religious meetings if he could -attend to his business." "I think," Mr. Howe observed, "Christians should mani- ,    272     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. fest their piety, should show a difference from the people of the world; and I know of no better way for them to do this than by honoring God in his sanctuary, and by their engagedness in calling upon him at the throne of grace. If professors are what they ought to be, they will forego their own interest forthe sake of spending an hour together during the week in seeking God's blessing on their church and ministry and on a world lying in wickedness. I do not think there are many in our church who would enjoy themselves much in being absent from our prayer meetings or from Sabbath services, unless they were prevented in- the providence of God from being present. The great in- terest which the members of our. church have in these meetings is, a marked peculiarity in their character." "If your deacon is really uninterested in religious meetings, as I should judge lhe was from his being able to attend to his business in all weathers notwithstanding his diseased stomach," Mrs. Howe observed, "I should think his influence would be disastrous in your parish." "Well, it really is," Mrs. Little said. "The other dea- con is very aged and infirm, and is unable to go from home much; and therefore we have, as it were, but one deacon; and to have him so worldly is a serioeus evil. He is looked up to for an example; and, because he is so infrequent at our prayer meetings, other brethren justify themseves in being absent; and the consequenee is, we have a very small attendance, and such meetings exist only in name." A  few/days from this conversation, as Mrs. Eldridge was along in the parlor, with the entry door ajar, she heard Mrs. tHo e remark to a little girl whom she was accom- panying io the door,-  "Give my love to your mother, and tell her I am very much obliged to her for hoe present, and hope we are very grateful to her, and to your father likewise, for all their kindness," 'I   A MODEL PARISH.      ,  273 Entering the room, then, where Mrs. Eldridge was sit- ting, Mrs. Howe said,- "Look here, Mrs. Eldridge, and see the valuable present I have just received!"  "That is a present indeed," Mrs. Eldridge said. "What very nice silk 1 It must have cost a dollar and a quarter a yard. It will make a fine dress. You seem to be highly favored with such attentions from your people." "Yes, we are," Mrs. Howe observed. "We have a very kind and considerate people. It is very seldom that we have to purchase any article of dress. The ladies are very attentive to me, and the gentlemen look out well for Mr. Howe. I believe he has not purchased but one suit of clothes for twenty years. His hats, and cloaks, and other garments all come in as this piece of silk has; and it makes a great difference in our salary, I assure you." "O, it must," Mrs. Eldridge observed. ' It must save you a hundred and fiftv or two hundred dollars a year." "That is what we have thought," Mrs. Howe said; "and then our children have been pretty much all clothed with presents from the people. There are few such par- ishes as ours, Mrs. Eldridge." "So I have long thought," Mrs. Eldridge observed, "from what Mrs. Little has often informed me of your people ; and, since I have been here, I have thought 'the half had not been told me.' I should think you had presents almost every day." "We do have them very often. The truth is, I believe almost every family in the parish mean to give us something every year; the very poorest send some trifling expression of their regard; but, then, we always more than make it up to such parishioners. It is very pleasant, however, to have them disposed to remember us." "I should like to have it so," Mrs. Eldridge said. "Presents coming from families in different parts of the   274     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. parish furnish much encouragement to a minister, inasmuch as they indicate a good state of -feeling; and, you know, ministers are very sensitive creatures; they like to -have their people feel kindly towards them, for then they can be more instrumental of good." "I wonder people dormt think more of this than they do,' Mrs. Howe observedc. "It is truly a great encouragement to a pastor to know and feel that his people all regard him with affection-; and then, again, how very much they might relieve him by doing as our people do-send 'him from time to time such things as they can spare without feeling it in the least,'and which would save the minister many dollars in the course of the year I  "O, you do not mean to say that people could send such a present -as you have just received without feeling it?" Mrs. Eldridge said. "O, no, indeed. People in general could not do so; but the family from which this dress came don't feel such a prefent. They are rich, and Mr. Hanson is making money very fast. Butften, ourfarmers could send a little butter, or potatoes, and such like, you know, and not feel what they sent in the least. Now, our people do so. We have beef and pork, apples, potatoes, &c., sent in from dif- ferent families; and in the course of the year it amounts to much, I assure you." "How much is your husband's salary?"Mrs. Eldridge inquired. "Mr. Howe was settled, you know, about forty years ago, with a salary of six hundred dollars; and this is his present salary; but, then, times have changed since, and expenses of living are much larger. Our people feel this, and would have raised the salary ten or fifteen years ago; but4Mr. Howe thought it would not be best, and has dis- couraged it. The people told him they were able to pay mre and were willing to do so, and, if they were called   A MODEL PARISH.        2 75 to settle a successor, should expect to pay-two or three hundred dollars more; but husband said he had rather not have his salary raised. He was satisfied with what he received. I suppose he has the more presents by rea- son of this, as our people do not mean to have it said that parishes around us who are settling new ministers pay more than they do. I have no doubt that we receive as good as ten hundred dollars a year." ' "Well, I suppose," Mrs. Eldridge said, "if your hus- band should be taken away, your people would have th pay a salary of a thousand dollars." "O, yes; that is what'they say; and they do not feel like paying Mr. Howr less than what they would have to pay a young man.'                    , "I admire this trait in the character of your people,? Mrs. Eldridge said. * "Now, I know several parishes who pride themselves on saving three or four hundred dollars a year because their ministers were settled some years ago, when salaries were not so high as they are at present; and I think it is shameful in them." "It is, truly," Mrs. Howe said. "When pastors have grown gray in- the service of a people they ought to be well cared for and treated as generously as they would treat a young man. Our people would not be guilty of such meanness, I know. At any rate, they are not." During the visit of Mrs. Eldridge she took occasion to :inquire of ]Mr. Howe if the waters of his parish always ran smoothly; if there had not been sometimes tumultuous waves.  "I have a very considerate people, madam," the good man replied, '"and to their candor and good sense I am indebted for uncommon quietude in my ministry thus far. Had I been in some parishes I have no doubt my course would have been very uneven, and it is probable I should have been dismissed twice or thrice. There have been times   276     A VOICs FROM THE PARSONAGE. when clouds have darkened my horizon; but they have stood but for a moment. I have always had parishioners who acted from principle and were guided by intelligence and the spirit of the gospel. They have seen failures in me, and- have apologized for them to those who would have made use of them to my great disadvantage. The leading characters in the parish have felt that ministers were but men ; and they have always been disposed to put a favorable construction upon my conduct, and to hold me up when any restless spirits have attempted to bring me down. The fact is, the great body of my people, Mrs. Eldridge, have no manner of sympathy with that spirit which exists in so many parishes at the present day that -leads to such fre- quent, dismission of ministers. They think it is wrong, that it is wicked, and that it is ruinous both to parishes and ministers. They feel that a people ought to bear and 'forbear in their treatment of pastors, and that there is no other way of getting along this side heaven, seeing all men, ministers as well as others, are frail and imperfect. They know that they cannot have a perfect minister, and they are wise enough not to make theattempt after such." "The more I become acquainted with' the: -history and character of your people," Mrs. Eldridge said, " the more I discover to admire and commend. I think they deserve a premium for having discovered that there are noperfect ministers, and for not trying to obtain what they know they cannot find." "That is a great thing to know, and to feel, and to be governed by; there are no perfect ministers,"-Mr. Howe said. "The ministry is committed to earthen vessels. No doubt ministers might be better than they are, - for one, I feel that I ought to be much better than I am, -but they are but men, and people ought to regard them as entitled to the same candid consideration which is accorded to other men. x   A MODEL PARISI.         2" "If our parishes would thus regard ministers," Mrs. El- dridge observed, "how much better it would be for themI and how much more good might be accomnplished by minis- ters, to say nothing of the pleasure and peace ministers would then enjoy! Now, people know that there is no perfection this side heaven; they know they cannot have a perfect minister; and it is strange that they will attempt to obtain one. I know a number of parishes who within the last twenty years have dismissed several most excellent ministers, as good men as are to be found, as talented, as eloquent, as learned; and the reason was, that they saw some things in them which did not exactly suit; -and so they turned them off, expecting to be better pleased; but they have not bettered themselves yet; and the probability is, some of them will be rent to pieces whilst contending about what makes a perfect minister; for you know there is a difference of opinion on this point." "But you know," - Mr. Howe was proceeding, but was interrupted by the entrance of his wife with a letter for Mrs. Eldridge, who, upon seeing the superscription, ex- claimed, "This is from my husband!" Craving permission to read it, the further conversation was suspended. - . :-* -' 2 4    CHAPTER XXIV. THE LETTER. THE epistle which was put into Mrs. Eldridge's hands, and that interrupted the conversation detailed in the pre- ceding chapter, was from her beloved husband. The main object of this letter was to convey to her the most melan- choly intelligence that their firm and steadfast friend Mrs. Davidson was just lingering on the' borders of time, with the expectation of her friends that every day would intro- duce her to the eternal world. Mr. Eldridge, therefore, wished her to excuse his waiting at her father's for her return, as he should leave at once for the scene of his pas- toral duties, that he might be once more with one who had been to him such a valued friend, and db all that he could to comfort the dying saint and administer consolation to her afflicted family. Mrs. Eldridge could no longer enjoy herself away from her husband and the scene where were those sorrows which had gathered in the mansion of the squire. She hastened her return to her father's, and from thence to her own home, and was but two days behind her husband in arriving there. It was, however, too late to see the liv- ing Mrs. Davidson. Her last enemy had conquered the evening preceding the noon when Mrs. Eldridge arrived at home; and Death had her cold and emaciated, in readi- ness for the tomb. (278)   THtE LETTER.        279 More severe grief could hardly have torn both Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge had an own parent been thus despoiled of earthly existence; for from the friend who, had lately left them they had for years most constantly received the warmest, tenderest expressions of friendship and love. A stranger, on entering the parlor where was the venerable squire, bowed down in the dust by the loss he was bemoan- ing, with his sons and daughters, all of whom had been allowed to meet in the chamber of a dying mother- and Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge, would have found it difficult to dis- tinguish any difference in the grief- in those stricken hearts. Probably there was not much difference; for all were bound to the dead most firmly. Affection, we know, when it is true and real, hath cordsIs strong as those of Nature's creation; and surely none ever doubted the-genuineness of the love in both Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge for the departed friend or her honored companion. When the last offices of affection had been, rendered and the grave had received another token of its power,- when the mourners began again to look after the affairs of earth after having had their attention completely absorbed by the things which are not of this world,- Mr. Eldridge took the letters which had accumulated in his absence, and began their perusal. There was' one among them which made a deep impression on his mind, and drew from himn the greatest attention; for it touched on a theme that ever interested the friend who had lately been called away, and upon which she never was too feeble or fatigued to dwell; viz., the trials of a gospel minister. This letter was from a clerical friend who had been settled in Mr. Eldridge's vicinity about seven years, in which he gave the unpleas- ant information that he was about asking a dismissiSn. This information was no more unpleasant than it was surprising; for Mr. Eldridge had supposed that his -friend was ardently attached to his people and that they were   280     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. happily united in love and affection to him. He could not brook the consideration that the tie that bound them together should be severed; and, moreover, he was not ready to have one held so dear by himself leave his own vicinity and go where their intimacy would be interrupted, if not entirely broken off. He sat an hour -or more in his study contemplating the subject, and at last concluded that he would, in the afternoon, ride over to the parish of Mr. Bertram, and, if possible, prevent his carrying into execu- tion his plan of leaving. Accordingly, Mr. Eldridge, after dinner, made his way to his valued friend, whom he found at home, and with his request for a dismission already writ- ten, to be communicated to his people on the following Sabbath. "I am happy to find that you have not presented your request," Mr. Eldridge remarked; " and I think you must secede from your determination to do so, at least for the present. I have come over to prevent your leaving, if I can. Now, tell me what has transpired to induce you to think of doing so." "I have always determined that I would not remain among my people," Mr. Bertram replied, " after I ascer- tained that there was any dissatisfaction with me; and I have within a few weeks discovered that there is uneasi- ness here, and so I shall take myself off." "What have you heard against you?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "O, I have not heard any thing very particular. It has been pretty strongly hinted, however, that the people would like a new minister." "Hinted!" said Mr. Eldridge. "Bywhom? Has Deacon Brown or Colonel Lowe- said any thing like this to you?" "O, no. I have not changed a word with them on the subject. I have not seen many of our people of late; for I supposed what I had heard to be true, and I did not care   THE LETfTER.        281 about conversing on the: subject, as I have made up my mind to leave." "Well, you have heard from some one that the people desired a new minister, you say; and I wish you would inform me from whom you had the information." "I have no objection to telling you," said -Mr. Bertram. "About three weeks ago Mr. Peabody and Mr. Cady called in to see me, as they said, for the purpose of con- versing upon the state of the church and parish. I readily entered into conversation with them on the subject, sup- posing they had some plan on foot for the accomplishment of good here, and in which they wished my cooperation. I soon found, however, that they came. to inform me that my services as pastor were unacceptable, and that it would be *pleasing to the people if I would in a quiet way take myself off. They said they supposed I was not aware -of the state of feeling towards me; that they felt that I ought to be apprised of it; and that it wa s the duty of some to make me acquainted with the facts in the case. , They said it was a very painful subject to talk upon, and that they had hesitated long before coming to see me in relation to it ; but at last their-consciences would not allow them to be longer silent, and so they came this evening to discharge their duty. I asked them what was alleged against me. They said, nothing in particular, The people all liked me very much as a man; but they should be better pleased and edified with a different minister. This wqs the substance of all thef said, although they were here talking about two hours." "Well, you say you have never conversed on the sub- ject with any of your people, and are yet intending to ask for a dismission?"Mr. Eldridge remarked. "Yes ; I have had no wish to talk, about my matters with mx people. If they are dissatisfied with me, I am ready to leave," Mr. Bertram said, 24          *   282     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "Have you any objection to my seeing a few of the people and making them acquainted with the state of your present feeling?" "No, not that I know of; but I should prefer that you would not. I am not very particular about it, however, as they will all know it on the Sabbath." Mr. Eldridge, being well acquainted in the parish, was induced by his deep interest in Mr. Bertram to move with considerable energy among his people, that he might be- come acquainted with the state of feeling towards their pastor, and, if possible, prevent his being dismissed. He first called on Deacon Brown, who lived near the par- sonage. After the first salutations were over, he began by inquiring after the condition of Mr. Bertram. . He soon found that the deacon was wholly ignorant of any dis- satisfaction with the pastor, and, when told of the present state of Mr. Bertram's feelings, was greatly surprised and exasperated at the cause. "I have supposed," said the; deacon, "all of our people were very much attached to Mr. Bertram; and I really be- lieve they are." "He thinks there is dissatisfaction, and has his request for a dismission already written, and is designing to pre- sent it next Sabbath," Mr. Eldridge observed. "He must not," the deacon said. "It will not do. Mr. Bertram has been deceived--has been grossly misin- formed." "Wvell, deacon, I wish you would get into the carriage with me, and we will call on some few individuals. If there is any uneasiness here, we can soon discover it, I think." The deacon was ready at once to join Mr. Eldridge in such a mission. They accordingly passed about among the people, and found the leading characters in the parish in the same ignorance of a desire for a change of ministry   THE LETTER.         288 as the deacon was. Ond individual who lived near Mr. Peabody's, whilst expressing his hot displeasure at this plan, this infamous plan, to effect the dismission of a most valuable pastor, as he expressed himself, remarked,- "I now understand what Mr. Cady and Mr. Peabody have been up to of late. I have seen them together al- most every day for a number of weeks past, and I could not imagine what their particular business was; but now it, is all out. I rather think they will find themselves ashore this time without any cargo." When Mr. Eldridge and the deacon had satisfied them- selves that Mr. Bertram had been greatly deceived and grossly misinformed in relation to the state of feeling towards him in the parish, they returned to his house and let him know the result of their investigations. "Can it be possible," Mr. Bertram said, after having heard the many expressions of confidence and esteem which had been repeated to him from his people by both Mr. Eldridge and the deacon,-" can it be possible that Mr. Peabody and Mr. Cady would come here and tell me the great body of the people were desirous of a new minister, when you say there is hardly an individual besides them but would mourn at my departure? I confess I am aston- ished." "I don't see,"' the deacon said, "how these brethren could have told you what they did. They must have known to the contrary, I think. Well, it is pretty cer- tain that they would like to have you go away." "Yes," said Mr. Eldridge; " there can be no doubt of that; and it was a plan of theirs to effect Mr. Bertram's dismission." "Well," said the deacon, "I am glad we found it out as we did, before Mr. Bertram had presented his request; for I never like to have a minister ask for a dismission. There is always some unpleasant consequence or other from it."   284     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGE. "I thought," Mr. Eldridge said, "that brother Bertram ought not to leave. I could not bear to have him do so. I could not bring my mind to the belief that it was neces- sary that he should leave; and so I came over to prevent it if possible." "We shall all be under great obligations to you," Dea. * con Brown observed, "for coming over and manifesting the interest you have. It would have been unfortunate if our first knowledge of dissatisfaction with our pastor had come to us in his request for a dismission. I do not think he would have got his. dismission; but he might if he was not so much liked, however. I have heard of a minister's asking for a dismission in consequence of the efforts of one or two individuals upon him, when his peo- ple were not dreaming of his leaving them, who was dis- missed without much trouble." "How was that?"Mr. Eldrid'ge inquired. "O," said the deacon, " the people of this minister were rather a stupid set, and they did not have interest enough in ministers' matters to turn out to the parish meeting; and so a few, four or five, did the whole business, and he was dismissed. If he had not asked for a dismission he might have died among his people; for they never would have turned him away if there had been a good reason. But there was no reason whatever for his dismission. The people said they liked him well enough; but, if he wanted to go, he might for all them. Most of the people in the parish did not know for some time after he was dismissed that he had, been induced to ask for a dismission by the representation that he was not popular with the people." "Ministers are very sensitive creatures," Mr. Eldridge remarked ; -'and one or two crafty parishioners may take advantage of this weakness and easily effect the dismis- sion of a  minister. They can tell him that his people don't like him; he will believe it, and treat them with   THE L'EltSR.        285 coldness, and-so make enemies. I have known several in- stances of pastors being dismissed in this way. Ministers ought not to hear every wind that blows. When they have evidence that any are dissatisfied with them, they ought not to show this knowledge in coldness, or indiference, or hard speeches. If they alter any in their conduct, they should be more attentive to the individuals- opposed, more conciliating. The fire would often go but and contention and animosity cease. I have known one or two ministers,  -who have grown old in the service of their people, who  would have been dismissed long ago if they hapd asked for   a dismission. Frequently have they been waited on by VI individuals and been told that a new minister would! be t acceptable to the people; but they maintained their temper I, all the while, and never let it be known by the least whis- per or the least variation of their kind treatment to any that they had heard that any dissatisfaction existed to- wards them." "How could such pastors do good if the people wished them to leave?"Mr. Bertram inquired. "There was nothing which could be brought against them," Mr. Eldridge said. 'They are good preachers and consistent men; but they are not great men. Some of their people thought, as the parishes had greatly in- creased in consequence of railroads which run through them and of manufacturing which had been introduced, that they ought to have ministers who were more eloquent and popular. They knew they could not effect the dismis- sion of these ministers if they .were disposed to stay; and so they resorted to the contemptible course of waiting on them and telling thems how this and that individual felt towards them, hoping to work on theirofeelings and induce them to seek a dismission.  But these ministers were bother of them very prudent and good men; and- they received all these interpositions of busybodies with meekness, and  .    286     A VOICE FfROM THE PARSONAGE. never made any stir, but continued ot in their old way; and are now, and ever have been, very much/respected and very useful. They don't believe that a fiuctuating minis- try is a useful ministry. They are convinced that fastidi- ousness in a people is a great sin and has produced great evil in parishes; and, from principle, they will not encour- age it by any conduct of theirs." "They are right," the deacon said; "and I wish there were more like them. I wish ministers would not be so sensitive-Ithat they would bear and forbear, and outlive the little tempests that will come up in parishes. They might easily do it if they would but endure the sacrifice of feeling; and, should they, the effects on their ministry would be most happy." Much of this conversation was had as Mr. Eldridge stood, with hat in hand, waiting to return home; and it was late in the evening before he could release himself. At length he departed, with many thanks from Mr. Bertram and his deacon for the very friendly interest he had manifested in their welfare as pastor and people. By the time he arrived home all lights were extin- guished in the houses around, and but one burned feebly in his own abode ; for itwas almost midnight. To his great delight he ascertained that a most valued brother in the ministry and his wife, who lived remotely from him, were their guests, having reached the place about two hours after he had left on his visit to Mr. Bertram. The next morning at the breakfast table he gave an account of this visit, which elicited from all expressions of wonder that so much mischief to a minister might be wrought by one or two designing, crafty men in a parish. Mr. Cook, the friend and- brother above alluded to, remarked that this case reminded him of an instance of ministerial dismission which was lately effected in his neighborhood through the wily conduct of a collector of the salary. This collector ,   THE LETTER.  '       287 was opposed to :the minister, but veiled his opposition so artfully that it -as not manifest till it had accomplished its end and the minister was dismissed. In the course of -travels around the parish he was in the habit of repre- sting the prosperous condition of the pastor's financial concerns, and of remarking that he probably did not wish to have his people put themselves to any inconvenience to make out his salary. Credit was accordingly given to his say- ings by many who really had so, many calls for money in the economical support of their families that the stipend they felt bound to pay their minister was assuredly felt to be a tax. Yet they paid it cheerfully heretofore because they considered it a just debt, and would have been will- ing to have sacrificed more rather than have had their pastor in the least straitened ; for he was well beloved by his people. They were dilatory in paying only because the collector had represented that there was nov want of the money, and not because of any unwillingness to main- tain their minister. After the collector had gone: over the parish and paid into the treasury what he had received, it was discovered that the salary fell short more than a hundred dollars. When asked for information on the subject, he remarked that he could not account for the fall- ing off in any other way than by supposing that the people were becoming- tired of their minister. This declaration. astonished both the treasurer and parish committee, who were unwilling to believe that such was the fact. . They talked much on the subject, and each one remarked that no rumor of dissatisfaction with the pastor had reached them, and they thought that there must be some other reason. They closely interrogated the collector as to his faithful- ness in calling upon all, and were replied- to that he had seen every individual in the parish and requested all to pay. The committee and treasurer all knew that the want of the money would be seriously felt by the pastor, as they knew   as      .             * r 288     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. he was depending upon every dollar to enable him to keep out of debt, which was to- him a very sore evil. More. over, they said, if our pastor should know that there was a falling off in the payment of his salary, the effect would be very great upon him. Being all of them well off in the world and of generous dispositions, and having strong attachment to their pastor, they concluded that they would say nothing about the deficiency to any one, and would make it up from their- own pockets, which they did; and the salary was fully and promptly paid. The com- mittee, however, were disturbed; and they agreed that they would, as bccasion might offer, sound the people, and ascertain if there was any root of bitterness spring- ing up among them towards their pastor. In the course of a few months, as the committee and treasurer were in session, the subject came up again, and each one reported that they had not found anf: who were seriously opposed to the minister, and were happy in the conclusion that the pastor stood high in the estimation of the people. No suspicion having arisen in the minds of any that the collector was an enemy to the pastor, he was chosen the second year; and when he finished up the work of this year it was found that a larger amount was wanting to complete the salary than the last year revealed. The collector appeared grieved at the fact, as he said, but was led to believe that the people were really intending to give the-minister a gentle hint that it was time for him to be seeking another home. .The committee were greatly tried, and were led to believe that such might be the case. They were troubled what to do, as they knew the pastor was expecting his salary; and they were inclined to think that, if the people were becoming tired of him, it was im- portant that he should be apprised of the fact. They concluded that: they would not make up the deficiency then, but would pay the pastor what had been collected;   THE LETrTER.        289 which was done accordingly. As they supposed, the pas- tor was sorely disappointed ; but from none of the com- mittee did he obtain any clew to the reason. The: pastor, soon after pay day, met the collector and inquired of him the cause for the deficiency. The collector was glad of the opportunity of informing him, and told him that he supposed the people were withholding his salary to convey to him the information that his services were no ;  longer wanted. The pastor was taken altogether by sur- prise, and was greatly overcome with sadness and per- plexity. He had not dreamed of such a thing ; for he had discovered no abatement of affection or confidence in hLis people. However, being a man of nerve and energy, he soon rose above it. all, and for a few weeks was absent from his people. When he returned he brought with him a call to another pastorate. He speedily announced the fact to his people and requested a dismission. The peo- ple were taken by surprise; for they all loved their pastor. He was beset from all quarters for the reasons of his con- duct, which he frankly gave them, when their indignation became great at the course pursued by the collector. The deficiency of his salary was only a matter of convenience to some of the people, and not an indication of disaffection or indifference to0 :the pastor. They were ready to make it all up, and more, if he would withdraw his request and remain among them; but this he could not do; for he had virtually sought the call he had received, and felt in- honor bound to accept it. He persisted in his request, and was dismissed; and the collector had to leave the place with the curses of the people resting upon him.  r "Well," said Mr. Eldridge, " all this goes to show what one or two men in a parish can do with a minister. I won- der people don't learn somethingslby such facts as these." "They ought to learn; but they are rather slow at im- provement, after all," Mr. Hartwell observed. "I rather 25   290     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. think, however, the people of whom I have just spoken will be pretty careful who they put in as collector again." "A parish ought to be careful about this," Mr. Eldridge said ; " for a minister's good is in the collctorYs hands. If he is a friend to the pastor and a man of energy, he can put up the people to promptness and liberality in the payment of the salary; and no man ought to be a col- lector who is not the minister's friend, and a wise and pru- dent man too ; for when he goes round after the salary he must of necessity hear the people talk. They will talk at such times, and say things which they don't mean often; and the collector ought to be such a man as will give a right turn to conversation and maintain the pastor's side." "Yes; that is true," Mr. Hartwell observed. ' I know when you feel in the pockets of people you touch them; and a collector has it in his power to do a minister vast good or much injury at these times. He can often fan a flame or put it out."   CHAPTER -XXV. THE DIFFERENCE IT is well to contemplate the clerical profession in con- trast with the ,other learned professions, together with our merchants, farmers, mechanics, railroad and -manufac- turing agents, and even with some of our common day operatives. - The contrast may disclose a spirit, not by all readily accorded to them, which is the ruling, absorbing influence over those who enter the ministry, both in elect- ing the profession and in continuing in it. This contrast may show how self is set aside, and what are the sacrifices mlade by our clergy of the wealth, and honors, and ease of the present world. A social interview between Mr. Eldridge and one of his early acquaintance who visited him may present this con- trast. The two were natives of the same town, were neighbors, schoolfellows, and had contracted for each other, when children, a friendship which was not forgotten when they were men. Though many years had rolled by since their last interview, and though their spheres of action were very dissimilar, yet both were pleased at Mheet- ing again, and were made happy in a retrospection of former scenes and pursuits and in a remembrance of old acquaintances and friends. Though Mr. Brayton was a blacksmith and Mr. Eldridge a clergyman and scholar, yet they met as equals, and together talked and laughed about (291)   292    A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. other days with great satisfaction. The former had a strong mind, which had been kept informed of all the gen- eral subjects of the day; and it was with much pleasure that the latter often discovered in his friend rather unusual acquaintance with men and things, which denoted that the anvil had been left at times for the library, and that the head must have labored hard as well as the hands. It came out in the course of the visit that Mr. Brayton had by his own exertions acquired a, handsome property and that he was living in rather princely style. ,As he was incidentally speaking of his affairs, thereby disclosing the above fact, Mr. Eldridge unconsciously remarked,- "How differently circumstanced we are, friend Brayton I You probably are worth fifty thousand doflars, and I have not three thousand. It cost me between one and two thou- sand Collars to start in my profession, and you probably but three or four hundred. I have worked hard all my days and have just obtained my bread, and; you have acquired a fortune." "You know," Mr. Brayton observed, "your profession is not a moneymaking concern. The men who enter the ministry, I suppose, do not care to be rich." "Well, but why should they not be as well paid for their labors as other men are?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "They ought to be, I confess," said Mr. Brayton; "yet, somehow or other, people think, if they can only keep life in a minister and his family, that is all they ought to do." "I know this is apt to be the feeling of a parish. - The expenses of a minister's family are graduated on the most ecofomieal scaler and then the salary is voted him accord- ingly. Well, so it is; and yet, for all that, I would not give up my profession," Mr. Eldridge remarked. "There is a higher consideration than money or any thing earthly, I hope, which moved me to enter the ministry or to con- tinue in it.   THE DIFFERENCE.        293 "How does the Bragg family make out?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "I have hardly heard from them since we were at school." Mr. Brayton remarked that there were "but two of the boys living, three having died before becoming of age. One is a carpenter and the other is a farmer; and both are very likely men, and are wealthy too." t "How is that George Hale? Is he living?"Mr. Eldridge asked. "O, yes,7"Mr. Brayton replied, "and is a flourishing merchant in Buffalo. They say he is worth two hundred thousand dollars. We did not think he was very promis- ing when we went to school together, did we?" "He was about the dullest scholar I ever knew," Mr. Eldridge said. "You know the teachers lost all their pa- ; tience with him. Well, I am astonished if he has made out so well." After inquiring in this manner after his early friends, playmates, and schoolfellows, and having a favorable account of most of them who survived to manhood, Mr. Eldridge again alluded to the great difference there was between his own temporal condition and theirs, and yet it was done in such a manner as to leave no impression on the mind -of Mr. Brayton that he repined at his lot or regretted that he had entered the ministry. "Well, Mr. Eldridge," saidMr. Brayton, " we have been over the ground pretty well with our early friends. I should like to know how your college friends have turned out. I have some acquaintance with college matters, you know, as my oldest son has been through, and he has had much to say about things there." "O, yes," said Mr. Eldridge, "I should like to compare their history now, seeing we are on the subject." So, taking the triennial catalogue, he turned to the years of his con- nection with college, and went over the names of both his 25 *   294     A VOICE PfOM THE PARSONAGE. own classmates and of the members of the other classes who were with him there, and remarked on the history of each one, so far as he knew, of his own class. The one who had the highest honor at graduation was a respect- able country minister. The'one who had the second honor was himself; the one who had the third was dead. He found one classmate a judge of the supreme court of his native state, and remarked, "He is rich as a Jew." He found two who had been in Congress, and he believed were wealthy. He found seven who were ministers now living with a bare competency as a salary; five who were ministers had deceased.  He found several were phy- sicians and merchants, and most of them were well off in the world.  - "It seems all but the ministers have got along well," Mr. Brayton remarked. "Yes, it does," Mr. Eldridge replied. "There is San- ders, the fag end of our class; I am told that he is a very wealthy man at the west. He studied law, and for a while had an office; but he gave up his profession and went to speculating in lands, by which course he has amassed a large fortune."                I "If you had turned your attention to law rather than theology, I suppose you would have been as wealthy as any of your old friends by this time, Mr. Brayton remarked. "Very likely," Mr. Eldridge replied; " but, had I, been assured of this, I presume it would have made no difference in my course. I felt called on to devote myself to the ministry, andI have no reason now to regret my course." You expect your reward in another world, I presume," Mr. Brayton observed.  "Of course I hope to be approved at last as a servant of my Savior, though I feel that I have been very unfaith- ful. If I should reach heaven and find that I had been the means of turning some of my fellow-beings to the Lamb   THE DIFFERENCE.        295 of God who taketh away sin, I think the reward will be great for all that I have suffered here in my ministry." "Well, I acknowledge that it would; but then I do not see why ministers in our country, where the people are all able to do well by them, are not more considered, and have not a compensation more like that which lawyers and physicians obtain," Mr. Brayton Said. "The great mass of the people acknowledge the ministry to be more important to their temporal welfare than the legal or the medical profession and they feel that to their eternal interest the ministry is indispensable. I should think, therefore, they would better provide for the ministers than they do, and not have such a wide difference in their temporal circum- stances from those who are around them. I am sure min- isters would do good with money, and I feel that they ought to have it." "I agree with you, "Mr. Eldridge remarked, "that a people should so provide for their minister ps to enable him to have money at command; for by so doing he could be more -useful in many ways. He would be free from anxiety which now often cripples him; and he would be enabled to set a good example to others in the use of money. Furthermore, the great difference of which we have been speaking between a minister's worldly circum- stances and others would be done away, and doubtless many would enter the ministry who now turn from it be- cause it is regarded as so poorly provided for, and as the sure way for great anxiety, sacrifice, and suffering. I really wish our churches might be induced to look into the sub- ject, and then I feel that there might be- a change for the better. I know of no reason why a minister of a- parish should not receive as much from the people as a lawyer or physician. Yet they do not ordinarily receive half as ll C lla   CHAPTER K XVI THE PASTOR CALLED TO A PROFESSORSHIP. SEVERAL times during the ministry of Mr. Eldridge there were extended to him semi-official invitations to leave the people of his charge and occupy pulpits which the fashion of this world would characterize as more pop- ular andeligible than his own. But to all such soundings on the part of parish committees and others he gave no encouragement, as his views ever had been partial to a settled and permanent ministry, and strongly opposed to a fluctuating one. He was peculiarly sensitive on this sub- ject, having seen the deplorable consequences, both to minis- ters and churches, that follow dismissions for reasons other than those which were not insurmountable, and most obviously indicative that it was the will of the great Head of the church that such dismissions should take place. Whenever he was on councils for the settle- ment of pastors he would oppose with all his energy the introduction of the seeds of dissolution of the relation he was- invited to aid in consummating, as he frequently 'ound them-in the "three or six months' notice" of either party which might desire a change. So successful was he in his opposition to these ways of settlement that in more than one instance did the people who had inserted such a clause in their pastor's call pledge themselves before the council that it should be rescinded, and no conditions (296)   whatever attach to the settlement other than those fixed by law and sanctioned by ecclesiastical usage. Although Mr. Eldridge might have left for a more ex- tensive charge, and where the emoluments of his office would have been much enlarged, yet his people were kept in ignorance of these matters. He did not care to have them disturbed nor his own time and feelings engrossed with discussions in relation to such considerations. As the overtures to him from abroad were privately tendered, so his decisions were rendered in silence; and thus all tumult and ,inquisitiveness were saved. After he had been settled seventeen years he received an invitation to a vacant professorship in one of our theo- logical institutions. So well adapted was he to this office, and so much more useful might he be in it, that it was taken for granted that he would sed as others saw and ac- cept the situation. The announcemen-t of the appointment was made in the papers; so that the people of his parish heard of it almost as soon as the mail which, brought the invitation to Mr. Eldridge arrived in town. Of course there waa commotion in all parts of the parish, and every little circle might be heard discussing the probabilities of their pastor's leaving, and variously expressing their feel- ings in relation to the call. :So far as public rumor had it, Mr. Eldridge stood at this period of his ministry as high amongl his people as at any former time. If animosity or dislike existed in any breast towards him, it lay th(e smothered and concealed. It was not known that any desired a change of ministry; and, from the manner in which the pastor's recent invita- tion to a professorship was received, it might have been inferred that all the people were satisfied with him still and anxious to retain him in their service. A large party was assembled at the house of Doctor Howard soon after this appoiAtment,-and it was made the subject of very fiee-:discussiou there. ... r   298     A VOIC'E FROM THE PARSONAGE, "Are we to lose our pastor?"Mrs. Jones inquired of Mrs. Clay. "I hope not, most. assuredly," was the reply. "I hope and trust Mr. Eldridge will n t think of leaving us. Do you feel as though he would, Mrs. Jones?  "I don't know," she replied. "I hope he will not; but I am afraid he will. The situation to which he is invited would afford him such a large field of usefulness, and would enable him to be so entirely devoted to study, that I have thought he might be disposed to leave here for the sake of being situated more to his mind." "How can you think so?"Mrs. Clay asked, in an ex- cited manner. "I have not thought it possible that Mr. Eldridge could -leave us." "Have you heard that he was going to leave us?" Mrs. Parker inquired. "O, no, I have not," Mrs. Clay said; "I have hardly heard a word on the subjeet till I came here this evening. Mrs. Jones just said that she thought there were strgng inducements in the situation to which Mr. Eldridge had been invited to persuade, him to accept his appointment." "O, I thought I heard Mrs. Jones say that he would leave; and I thought I would draw up to you and inquire more particularly about it." "No; I did not say that he would leave, but that I feared he might," Mrs. Jones observed. "I hope he will not," Mrs. Parker remarked. "It would be a great misfortune to us were he to do so. I can't think he would be any more pleasantly situated any where than in his present place. The people are all ar- dently attached to him, and he understands them very well, and can do more good here, I am persuaded, than any one-else.* "Thait is the way I feel," said Mrs. Clay. "You know it takes time to become thoroughly acquainted with a X           - ' -- ^ :::   THE r1K ArAu 1VA e AceW J* 4 people; and now, as Mr. Eldridge has been here so long and knows all about us, he is better qualified to be useful to all classes than any other minister could be.; The people, you know, love and respect him; and when a minister has gained the confidence of a people he can do great good to them." "That is true," Mrs. Jones said ; " and I hope our pas tor will feel so, and remain with us." "O, it would o-t be right for Mr. Eldridge to go away after halving been here so long," Mrs. Parker said; " and I don't believe he will go. He is opposed to ministers' leaving their people, you know." "Yes," said Mrs. Jones, "he has said a great deal about such practices, I know ; but then there may be sufficient  reasons for a pastor's being dismissed." Mrs. Clay, finding Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Parker in ani- mated discussion of the question,-rose:-and took a vacant seat by the side of Mrs. Smith, who was very grateful for having an opportunity to converse with her upon the now absorbing subject. "Mr. Eldridge won't leave us, will he, Mrs. Clay " "I cannot think he will," Mrs. ,Clay replied. "I have not heard any thing said about it before I came here. In- deed, I have not seen any one since the news came till this afternoon; but I don't believe Mr. Eldridge will go away.'  "That is right," Mrs. Smith said. "I feel just, as you do. I have hardly thought of any thing else since I heard of his appointment. It would kill me if he should go. I tell my husband the parish. would be ruined if Mr. El- dridge should be dismissed." "Does the deacon think there is any probability of Mr. Eldridge's accepting the offer?"Mrs. Clay asked.: "No; he does not. He says he cannot leave us as the people would not submit to it."   300    A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "I as your husband heard much said about it?"Mrs. Clay inquired. - "O, yes ; almost every one who comes to the mill talks to him about it. He was up in town here yesterday, and he said he did not know as he should be abe1-to get home and do 0his business, there were so many stopping him to talk with him about our pastor." "Do you know how Colonel Presbury feels on thesub- iect?"Mrs. Clay asked., "No, I do not. Mr. Smith said that he saw him yester- day with several others, but he did not know as-he opened his mouth on the subject." "I did not know but that he might be willing to have him go," Mrs. Clay said. "You know he felt pretty badly about being taxed to pay the parish debt some years ago, and I have thought he has felt differently towards Mr. El- dridge ever since?- for, you know, he was the means of having that old debt paid." "I know he was,"- rs; Smith said; " and it was a capi- tal Wing for the parish too. My husband every now and then speaks of it, and says Mr. Eldridge did a goodt thing when he preached that debt sermon. I  know Colonel Presbury felt rather sour about being taxed; but, then, he said the debt ought to be paid." "Yes, I know he said so; but,'then, he was for selling the parish lands, and paying it with the proceeds," Mrs. Clay said; " and because the lands were not sold and a tax was made he did not like it at allland he said hard things about Mr. Eldridge." "Ah, I  never heard of that," Mrs. Smith said. "If I did I  have forgotten it, it is so long since the debt was paid. Colonel Presbury always speaks well of Mr. El- dridge when I  see him." "O, yes, I  know he does," Mrs. Clay said; " but, then, he don't .forget being taxed so roundly."   l,     - THE PASTOR CALLED TO .A PROFESSORSHP. 301 "O, well," Mrs. Smith remarked, " he has not laid up any thing against our minister, I dare say; he has too much good sense for that, I know." Mrs. Howard passing along, Mrs. Clay remarked,- "I am sorry not to see your father here to-night, Fran- ces. I was expecting to have a good chat with him." "We urged him to come out," Mrs. Howard said; 'but he don't care about being in such a crowd as we have here. He has not been out much in company since mother died. He says he prefers being at home." "He:has: no fears that Mr. Eldridge will go away, I presume.?"'. "O, hp0 ;the was in here this morning, and said that he did not believe Mr. Eldridge had the most distant thought of leaving." "Has your father had any conversat'ion with him on the subject? Mrs. Clay inquired.  - "No. I think he said he had -not exchanged a word with Mr. Eldridge on the subject." .. "Well, he would have said something to him abou it if    he had any idea of leaving, I know," Mrs. Smith said; !r? " for Mr. Eldridge always consults the squIre, you know, on every subject; don't he, Mrs. Clay?  I have thought so," Mrs, Clay replied; "but perhaps he may yet." "What does your husband say about Mr. Eldridge's leaving?"Mrs. Smith inquired. "He is about so much he would be likely to hear what is said in the parish." "He says he shall be glad when the marter is settled, for every one is asking him so many questions about it," Mrs. Howard remarked. "He, don't find any who wish to have him go, does he?" said Mrs. Smith. '      -  "O, I do not know as he does," Mrs. Howard replied; "but perhaps there are some for all that. They would 26   302     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. not dare to say so to him, you know, if they were opposed to Mr. Eldridge." "No," said Mrs. Clay. "People would be very careful not to let any of your familytknow if they disliked our pastor. Indeed, it would not be very politic for such to let their feelings be known to any one, Mr. Eldridge has so many friends."  "I see, Mrs. Clay," Mrs. Smith said, " you are inclined to believe that there may be some who would be glad to have Mr. Eldridge leave.' "O, I do not know how you could make gny!ueh infer- ence," said Mrs. Clay.        i :r:r!: "You seem to think Colonel Presbury don't feel as he formerly did, do you not?" O, O I think, as I said, that he was displeased about the old parish debt,.dI think he has never got over it; and if he thought:it would answer, and he could succeed, he would exert himself tio EVe Mr. Eldridge go away." "I never heard:'i -bue: say before that there was a single individual in the "parish of any consequence who would like a new minister," Mrs. Smith said, with -great warmth.,: "I don't believe Colonel Presbury does. If he could be the, means of having Mr. Eldridge dismissed, I do not thihikfhe would use his influence for it.' "I hope he would not; but perhaps time may show," said Mrs. Clay. "Mr. Clay has said for years that Colonel Presbury never would forgive our pastor for that debt ser- mon, and that he would one day make it the occasion of trouble." "I am astonished," Mrs. Smith said. "If I thought the colonel felt so towards Mr. Eldridge I should cross him oait of my books. I cannot ,believe that he does."' "O, well, I hope he does not," said Mrs. Clay. "I would not say any thing about it to any one. I should not have spoken to you as I have in relation to it had I   THE PASTOR CALLED TO A PROFESSORSHP.  U6  b not supposed you would keep it a secret. I have never spoken of it before only to Mr. Howard's mother. She felt just as I do, and I have no doubt the squire does like- wise; Mrs. Davidson said that he did. Colonel Presbury is a man of very strong prejudices, Mrs. Davidson used to say. He never forgets." "If he feels as you fear that he does, how could he have acted as he has?" Mrs. Smith inquired. "We should have heard from his opposition before this. Certainly my husband would have heard of it." Cleresbury is a very cool, cunning man'"Mrs. Clay ::i:S:, ':B e knows when to act and when to be still. He is 6n!:waiting for an occasion to act surely. When an occasion offers, and if he can get -a few to side with him,'you will find that he will make difficulty here." O, well, he could get a few ali":: a:ny time to side with him, as you tsay," Mrs. Smith remarked. "There are Mr. Otis, and Mr. Scott, and Mr.^Andrews, who are ever ready to make parish trouble, y o! w.  "Ah, but such characters Coloine::Presbury don't care to walk wil alone," said Mrs. Clay. "If he had your husband and one or two like him, I guess he would be moving as I have said. You know a deacon can do much when opposed to a minister."     -::; "If he- can get my husband to joinohim in opposing Mr. Eldridge, there will be something new under the sun. If he waits for him, Mr. Eldridge will live and die here. /lMy husband would no more help dismiss Mr. Eldridge than he would try to get a new wife." "No, I dare say he would not," Mrs. Clay said. "I did not mean to insinuate that he would, but only to say that Colonel Presbury would not do any thing unless he had some persons of influence and standing to back him up." About a week from this period there was a townmeet!- ing for the choice of governor and other state' and county   304     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. officers, and the opportunity was improved in circles by various individuals in conversing on the appointment of Mr. Eldridge. At one time Deacon Stnith, Squire David- son, Doctor Howard, Colonel Presbury, aud:;one or two others were together talking over the matteri "I should think," said Deacon Smith, "that if Mr. El- dridge intended to leave us he would say something about it by this time; shouldn't you, squire?" "What do you mean, deacon?" said the squire. "Say something from the pulpit?" g'o   Yes; that is the common way, I believe, for ministers to do when they are thinking of leaving their people, is it not?" ';0, if he had determined to leave he would have an- nounced such determination before this, I dare say," the squire remarked. "Has he said any thing to you about it, squire?" Colonel Presbury asked. "Nothing," the squire said. "He has not been at home much of late, and I'have not seen him but once or twice since the news came. Besides, I do not think he would say any thing to me on the subject, nor, for that matter, to any one in the parish." "No, I presume  not," the deacon said. "He is not inclined to converse much on his own matters with any of his people." "No, I know he is not," Colonel Presbury said ; " but I thought '/iv eprobable he might have conversed with the squire about it. Well, squire, do you think he will accept?" "I have thought not, judging from what I know of his feelings in relation to pastors leaving their people. I think he will decide to remain with us. I do not believe it is: his duty to go any where else. I should very much regret it if he should leave us."   THE P:ASTOR CALLED TO A PROFESSORSHP.  805 "I know," said the colonel," he has a pretty strong hold here; but, then, I have thought he would go. The situation of a professor, you know, would suit his habits very well, andhe would enjoy himself more where he could have niothing to do but study than he can here with so many interruptions. Besides, the salary he is offered is much more -than what we give him; and that is something, you know." "He has a good salary here. I have never heard him complain," the squire said ; " and I do not think he would be influenced by money matters to leave us."  "No; not he," the deacon said; "nor by any otheir at- ters. I believe he will live and die among us. I hope so; for we can never get a minister who will be so generally useful here as Mr. Eldridge is. It Would be a dark day for our parish if he should leave." "O, I don't know about that," the colonel said. ' Mr. Eldridge is a very good man; but it would be strange if there are not others as good." - ^ "Would you have him go, colonel?" the deacon asked. "No, notf,?cat I know of; but I would accept a good offer if I were in his place. He is growing old, you know ; and perhaps in a few years some of the people might wish for a younger man. If he takes this professorship, he will be sure of a good berth as long as he lives." "How old is he?" the squire inquired with energy. "O, he is rising of fifty, I suppose," the colonel said. "Not fifty yet?" the squire remarked. "He is just in his prime. If he were as old as you and I, colonel, there would be some sense in talking about his being old, but not now. Mr. Eldridge will::be more useful here for twenty-five years to come, if he lives so long, than he ever: has been." "Well, I do not know but: he will," the colonel said . "YHe preaches as wellrnow as he ever did, I think." 26    306     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "He preaches better and better every year," said the squire ;-" don't you think so, deacon?" "O, yes; that is a fact," the deacon said. "His age won't hurt him these thirty years yet." : : - '"Do you think, colonel, there are any of the people here who would have Mr. Eldridge go away'? ' the deacon asked. "Why, no; not that I know of. He is liked very well, I believe, by most people." Seeing some one pass whom he wished to notice, the' colonel left the circle, when the squire remarked,- "I rather think Colonel Presbury would have no objec- tions to our pastor's leaving." "His conversation looked that way certainly," said the deacon ; " but he would not dare to say outright that he wished Mr. Eldridge to leave." "I wasastonished," Doctor Howard said, " to hear him talk so coolly on the subject. I thought he would have no objections to his leaving from his manner of speaking." "I never heard him express himself so before in regard to Mr. Eldridge, I confess," the deacon said. "Something or other he don't like about him, that is a fact." "You know," the squire said, "he talked very hard some years since when Mr. Eldridge took up the matter of the old parish debt. He did not like it at all to be- taxed for its payment. I don't know of any thing else that has happened but that to disturb the colonel. At any rate, I never have heard of any thing else." "That is an old affair," the deacon said. "That is dead and buried long ago; The.-colonel has forgotten all about it. I don't believe that is what disturbs him now, if any thing does." "I don't know about that," the squire said. "My good wife used to say,' The colonel neverforgets; he is a man of strong feelings.' She used to say that the colonel would one day make trouble out of that debt sermon."   -IfE 'PASTOR CALLED TO A PROFESSORSHP. 307 "Well, let him try,!' the deacon said; "he whfind he will have to work alone." A few weeks passed along, and nothing was known of the pastor's feelings in relation to, his new-appointment. He must hayve known, however, that there was strong anxiety on the part of his parishioners as to the disposition he would make of it; for on some of the many tongues which were in motion it must have been borne to him that his friends were enduring the anguish of suspense, and that it was their strong desire that he would speedily remove it.: At length, before pronouncing the benediction at the close of the afternoon services, he requested the audience to be seated, as he had a communication to make. If ever five hundred -souls- were ,in breathless silence, it was then. Mr. Eldridge proceeded to remark that he was aware that there had been considerable ex- citement in the parish in relation to an invitation he had recently received to a vacant professorship in one of our theological institutions. He extremely regretted that the appointment had been made public, as he always pre- ferred to have matters of this character confined to the parties immediately concerned until a decision could be made. He remarked that his judgment had long since been satisfied as to the duty of a pastor's continuance among his people. He was now, and ever had been, op- posed to ruptures of the pastoral relation. There were circumstances attending his recent appointment, he said, which were to him very pleasant. He felt that he could enjoy himself much in the situation to which he had been invited, but that he felt that he could not with a good con- science sunder the ties that bound him to the people over whom he had been solemnly ordained. He had returned such a decision in a verbal manner weeks before to one of the trustees of the institution to which he had been called. He was urged, however, to take more time for the   808     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. consideration of the matter; and, from respect to the body from whence the invitation proceeded, he had taken such time, but said the time only confirmed his first decision, and that decision "I returned in a letter last week, which I now here publicly declare. My views of my duty to -the people of my charge forbid my resignation. I have consecrated myself to your service, and- nothing .that I can do shall be done to sunder the relation now subsisting between us." After this manner the pastor addressed his people, and theni pronounced the benediction, and the people began to disperse.- Their countenances bespoke their relief and that they were most happily relieved. Throughout the week, in that parish, there was generally the expression of gladness that their pastor, who had served them so long and so faithfully, would continue to minister to them still. If there-were exceptions, they were known only to the excepted. The breath of regret was not heard by others than those from whom it escaped. If such regret had been open, it would have been at once swallowed up in the general joy, and have drawn upon those expressing it the severest frowns and indignation.   CHAPTER    XXVII., A DISAPPOINTMENT. THE impression must have been made upon the mind: of the reader that almost every excellence that attaches to the character of a faithful pastor was to be found in Mr. Eldridge. Not only had- he from year to -year ad- vanced in theological learning and ability to- preach '; not only had he. truly looked after the sick and sorrowful in, the many families belonging to his charge; not only had he a watchful eye continually out on all things which would contribute to the prosperity of the church and parish, whether in their corporate or ecclesiastical charac- ter ; not only was he the friend and advocate of those be- nevolent organizations the object of which is to lift the veil of moral darkness from all mankind, and :thereby bring them under the genial influences of Scripture, of science, and of every thing which can adorn human na-: ture; but he was more particular and specific, often, in - the objects of his benevolent regard. His mottoseemed to be, "Care for every one: do unto others as -you: would wish others to do to you."' If he saw that he could aid a parishioner in any way,- he was alert in sending him assistance. Instances of such friendly interposition might be cited by hundreds, which had occurred in the years: of his ministry, and many of them, too, wrich, in the process of, their manifestation, had been veiled from the public eye. (309)   310     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. A noticeable feature in Mr. Eldridge's character was his interest in mind. As this constitutes the great distinc. tion between man and the brute creation, he wished to see every where this distinction made as broad as it was in the power of education to accomplish. Consequently, almost every family in his parish experienced an impetus from him in the care of their own intellectual powers. Those who were parents in an especial manner were often roused to a consideration in this respect of their obliga- tions to their children. By Mr. Eldridge, more than any one individual in the'town, were the'educational interests advanced among the people far beyond those in the sur- rounding community. From among his own people did our colleges receive more youth to educate than from all other towns in the county. Whenever he noticed a sprightly, promising young intellect, he marked it, and in his conversation with the parents excited them to care for it well and see that it had the -necessary means for its culture. If he found such mind in a family where the parents were unable to do it justice, he would himself often look up friends who would assist in the important enterprise; and quite a number of lights in the legal, medical, and clerical professions would never have been known,-had he not interposed and prevented poverty from casting them into obscurity as they began to emerge into being. From almost the beginning of his ministry to the period when we are now contemplating him he might be heard facetiously alluding to his " boys whom he had to look after," meaning those who were- preparing for college or already there. At the period of his ministry in which we are now considering Mr. Eldridge there was a young man in his senior year in college who was indebted to him for being thus distinguished. Henry Arnold was the son of poor parents. Had his father lived, the- destiny of the   A DISAPPOINTMENT.       3" children would not probably have been any better ; for all that he could do for thetm was to feed and clothe them. He died when Henry was four years of age, and then the care of him and of his sisters devolved on his mother. Henry was a bright boy, and ever attracted the notice of his pastor. In the school he was always diligent, and for this reason prosperous in his studies. Before he was twelve years old Mr. Eldridge was often heard to say, "Henry Arnold must have an education." In one of those revivals which so frequently blessed Mr. Eldridge's ministry Henry was'converted. He had lived then six- F teen years. Though the pastor had-not heretofore seen I  his way clear to put 'him in the preparatory course for college, this event decided the matter. "Such a mind as oT Henry Arnold has must not-be lost to the church," was a !  remark often heard about this period from Mr. Eldridge. "He must have an education; he must be a minister." hi So entlusiastic was the pastor in the matter of te educa- tion of this youth that he encouraged him to commence :aa fitting for college at once. He furnished him with books, and for months heard his recitations and took the whole charge of his education. Indeed, he fitted him for college. He then found friends who contributed for his support there; for he was regarded by every one as a superior young man and as well deserving the advantages of a college. Nor did his career here in the least abate the ardor of friendship. It rather increased it, -and at the same time furnished a satisfactory remuneration for the aid which had been and wa-s being rendered., Hope began to be strong of him that he would make a most distin- guished clergyman. All who knew him felt safe in the indulgence of such- hope; for his talents from year to year, in the facilities for improvement which were around him, shone brighter and brighter, and thus indicated that his path in this world would by no means be narrow or   312     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. obscure. Mr. Eldridge, all saw, was proud of him. Among the people he relished any allusions to young Arnold. Two terms of his senior year had expired, and Henr: came home to spend the vacation. The second house tha saw him on his return from college was always that of hi pastor and friend. From his mother's he went always t( Mr. Eldridge's. When he returned to pass this his las vacation Mr. Eldridge was out of town, and not expected back for two days. He, however, had a warm reception from the pastor's wife, and, was in and out at the parsonage several times before Mr. Eldridge's return. Mrs. EldridgE thought she discovered in some of the expressions o Henry an inclination towards some other profession thai that of the ministry; but :-a/;all the circumstances of the case seemed to forbid such-i aninclination, and as the mani festation-was but'slight, she-could not realize that it could have been designed by Henry. Of course she did no converse with him as if there was a fear in her mind tha he would not be a minister. Mr. Eldridge returned home the third day after Henry's arrival. Of course there was much said of the friend who had long been near and dear to the pastor and wife Whilst they were conversing respecting him during the evening, Mrs. Eldridge remarked that she did not know but that Henry was thinking of studying law, from some expressions he made to her. "He did not say much abou it, and perhaps some people would not have noticed the least tendency in his mind that way," she remarked. Mr Eldridge could not for a moment entertain such a sugges tion, and at once charged it to -isome imaginary influence which had possession of his wife, which the good lady was willing to have done. When Henry called the next day the pastor, in the course of the interview, remembering what his wife suggested, without the least anxiety on his part on the subject, but merely for the sake of a little pleasantry, said to his friend,-   !'       A DISAPPOINTMENT.       313 "What do you think my wife hinted to me last night after I returned?  Henry, either being at a loss for the right way of reply or not being yet ready to make the disclosure, hesitated, when Mr. Eldridge proceeded and said,- "She remarked that she did noft know but that you in- tended to study law." ) Henry instantly colored, and with hesitation replied,- "I was not aware that I had said to Mrs. Eldridge that such was my intention; but I must say that I have been greatly tried of late on the subject of a profession." At this remark Mr. Eldridge was greatly affected, and he made no reply for a few moments. At length, however, he said, "I thought that questkion had been decided for years." "Well, sir, so did I think so 'mtil the last term. I have always contemplated the subject prospectively, you are aware, and did not dwell upon every thing connected with the ministry as I have been induced of late to do, as the time draws near for me to commence a professional prepa- ration." "I supposed," Mr. Eldridge remarked, "your whole soul was absorbed with the glorious end of the ministry, and that its incidentals were of minor importance." "Well, sir, the incidentals, as you are pleased to call them, may very much affect some minds, so much so as to abridge their powers of doing good. I have thought that it is in the power of a pious physician or lawyer to do as much for God and man as a minister may accomplish. Certainly either might do lnore if the minister be not able tofulfil his ministry." "Not able to fulfil his ministry?"Mr. Eldridge said. "I do not know as I understand you. If a minister has a heart to preach and is blessed with health, why cannot he do so and fulfil his ministry? There is an abundant call for his labors." 27   314     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. ' I should not think there was a very abuhdant call for ministers, judging from the manner in which they are treated. When farmners have any portion of their crops cut off and they feel that they may fall short, they are apt to husband what little they have with great care and to use it with great economy. If, on the other hand, there is a great supply, they are more careless and indifferent. Now, it appears to me that if ministers were not very plenty, and if people did not think it was one of the easiest things in the world to get a minister, they would not treat them as they often do. Really, Mr. Eldridge, I have thought I should be used tiup in a very few years and be of no manner of service to tthe church, if I should study theology and enter the ministry. There are many ministers of whom I have heard, and some whom I know, who were thrown aside from their work before they were fifty years of age. Some of these were men of good talents, of fervent piety, and sound preachers, and of irreproachable characters. Now, if such had studied law or -physic, they might have been eminently useful as long as they lived. And then, again, if a minister sustains himself among a people till he is fifty or sixty years of age, he cannot reasonably expect to be useful much beyond that age. The cry is after young men, and the cry would be after- a young man, and the aged pastor would hear it, and be compelled either to retire or have a colleague. Now, I do not like such things. I think an aged minister deserves to be as well appreciated as an aced doctor or lawyer. We all know that, when a physician has acquired age, he is more sought after and- more confided in on that account; so it is with a lawyer. Now, as people when they are sick prefer the experienced and aged physician to one -who has had no, or but a very small, experience,- andas apeople, when they have property in jeopardy, consult experienced and aged lawyers in preference to younger and inexperienced men,-I do not   A DISAPPOINTMENT.       315 see why, in the matter of their souls' concerns, they should not prefer the ministers whose enlarged experience ena- bles them far to transcend in ability to do good the young man who just commences preaching. Now, Mr. Eldridge, you must have seen that, the older a minister grows, the less popular he becomes. Now, I do not wish to die before my time; and I am very much afraid, if I become a minister, I shall. I desire to do good as long as I live, and to increase in power and ability and opportunity to do good till I die." "You have made out something of a case," Mr. Eldridge remarked, "I suppose you think. What if all young men should reason as you do ; what would become of the church and the world?" "They would both become better, I hope. I think peo- ple would begin to reflect on their sinfulness in their treat- ment of ministers ; that they would repent and bring forth fruits worthy of repentance. Sometimes I have of late thought that it would be a good thing for the church if all our pious young men in our colleges would turn their attention to law, or medicine, or teaching for a- few years, so that there should be none in our theological seminaries preparing for the ministry. If such should be the case, I think ministers would be in demand and be treated as though they were of some account." "I am sorry to perceive," Mr. Eldridge replied, " that you are inclined to punish them all alike. Now, what you allege against people in their treatment of ministers is not true of many parishes.* It is not true of mine. I have been here now seventeen years, and I do not see but that I am as much respected as ever I was and as much appre- ciated. My people respect ministers, I have thought, and are inclined to exalt them, perhaps, more than is proper. And there are other parishes that I could: mention who always treat their pastors well, and who would be aggrieved , .?.   316     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. and feel themselves slandered by such remarks as you have made." "There are exceptions to every rule, you know, Mr. Eldridge. I am aware that what you state of some par- ishes is true. I am willing to concede that we find here and there a minister who is appropriately treated by his people and who grows in their affection and confidence; but I think, where one such parish is found, there can be ten found of the opposite character." "Do you find much sympathy in the pious members of your class with the views you have expressed to me?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "That I do. I do not think I should have felt as I do had I not conversed with these members as I have. Our whole class during the past year, almost every week after recitation, have remained a while and dbbated on the in- ducements held out by the three professions; and I tell you we have gone over the ground pretty thoroughly. What has been said in these debates about the inducements at the present day held out by the ministry has opened my eyes some and led me to close thought." '"What has been thus said?"Mr. Eldridge asked. "It would be a gratification to me to be informed." "The precariousness of the pastoral relation is one of the strong objections to the clerical profession. A man don't know when he is safe. He may think himself strong in the affections of his :people one month, and before another comes he may find that uneasiness has set in and that many of his people desire some other minister. "One member of the class said that the minister in the town from which he came was dismissed last year because some of his people became dissatisfied at the choice he made of a wife. It was desired that he should marry a friend of an influential family in the parish; and, as he took the lib- erty to select his own wife, this family took exceptions to the   M            A DISAPPOINTMENT.  *     317 course, and withdrew their influence from him, and silently exerted themselves to his prejudice among the people, which resulted in his dismission. "Another member of the class remarked that there was then a great commotion in the parish where he resided because the minister's cows got into his neighbor's corn. The fact was, the neighbor would not keep up his fence, and the minister did not feel that it was his duty to see to it any further than to request the neighbor to keep it in repair. He could not afford to hire his cows pastured else- where than in his own pasture; and so they went where they chose, and much damage was done. The people gen- erally did not blame the minister ; but the neighbor became exasperated, and began to- rave wherever he went about the minister, telling for truth what never happened; and in this way he succeeded at last in creating a strong pre- judice against him, which it was thought would terminate in his dismission.   "Another member of the class mentioned that the min- ister in the town adjoining the one in which he lived had lately been dismissed because a certain D. D., who had some considerable influence in the parish, had a relative whom he wished to have settled there. To bring about this result the doctor blew up a little fire which had almost gone out, and started one or two others in a different quarter of the parish; and at length the pastor was so warmly situated that he thought it ft his comfort to vacate the parish for another minister. "Another member of,the class said that, in the town where a brother of hiss resided, the minister was about being dismissed because a pretty important lady in the parish did not think he was the right kind of a man to build up the parish. As she had much influence, many people listened to her, and of course the minister had to go." "Well," said Mr. Eldridge, "I should have thought 27'*    318     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE.  some of the class who advocated for the ministry would have urged that ministers are sometimes dismissed when the people are not in fault at all when the fault was alto- gether that of the minister." "They did, sir. There were two or three of the class, who will study theology at all hazards, who did take this ground; and they mentioned several instances where pas- tors had been dismissed on account of their own conduct. It was said a minister had lately been dismissed for his being too much of a horse trader; that another had left his people recently because he would not study. He pre- ferred the society of news tellers to his books, and was more willing to beton the piazza of the hotel, conversing with boarders there, than to being about among his peo- ple laboring to benefit their souls. But," the young man said, "those who advocated for the ministry could not bring up many instances where dismission had taken place when the ministers were most in fault. The other side could adduce five cases when the people were wholly to blame to one cited where the fault was entirely the minister's." In this way did the pastor and his friend continue their conversation for some time, the pastor feeling deeply grieved at the tendency manifested by his friend towards a different profession from that to which he had supposed he was devoted. Subsequent interviews only strengthened the pastor's conviction that the talents and piety of Henry Arnold would probably be lost 4to the ministry, and he mourned most sincerely over his disappointed expectations. Young Arnold at the close of the vacation returned to college, and in a few months was graduated with the highest honors of his class. He returned home, fixed in his purpose to pursue the study of law, provided he could do so with the approbation of those to whom he was in- debted for his collegiate education. As he made known              x DISAPPOINTMENT.       31 this decision his friends were much disappointed; for they were all induced to render him their assistance, in the be- lief that they would be thus adding another minister of Christ to the world. In the present state of Henry Ar- tnold's feeling, however, they could not urge him to enter on a profession against his own convictions, and therefore yielded to his wishes and released him from all obliga- tions tno study theologyi He therefore at once entered the office If a distinguished lawyer, where he diligently prosecuted the study of law till his entrance on practice. Though he had turned aside from the ministry, he did not allow the lustre of Christian character to become dim. He was regarded as a devoted Christian, and his many ways of activity for the advancement of the kingdom of his Savior were most warmly appreciated by all who were acquainted with him. ,    CHAPTER XXVIII. CALL TO ANOTHERI COUNCIL. MR. ELDRIDGE, on his return home to dinner, after haying been absent all the morning in the discharge of his paro- chial duties, found on the table of his study a letter mis- sive from a church and pastor, requesting the presence of himself and a delegate in an ecclesiastical council,-to ad- vise and act in some matters of difficulty. Of the pastor whose name was attached to the letter he had for some years heard pleasant things said; and though a stranger to him, yet Mr. Eldridge was accustomed to regard him as among our most useful ministers. He therefore was pained to learn, as the letter missive foreshadowed, that untoward events had disturbed the relations of this brother to his people which might result in his dismission. Al- though the distance was somewhat remote, yet Mr. El- dridge found himself possessed with a strong inclination to be present at the council, and his church accordingly voted to send.  He therefore, with a delegate, at the appointed time repaired to the scene of trouble. When the period arrived for the pastor to expose to the council his situation in relation to the people of his charge, he remarked that he had for months past felt that his pastoral connection with his present people must be dis- solved, and that he should in a quiet manner have sought a release had his judgment and conscience sanctioned the (323)   CALL TO ANOTHER COUNCIL.      321 course. He remarked, he was impressed that more than himself were affected by the causes which had of late in- terrupted 'his usefulness, and, therefore, that it was due to I  other interests that he should sacrifice his own private feelings and bring out to the public eye the course pur- sued to satisfy individual animosity and gratify unholy feelings, in attempts to undermine and destroy his useful- ness. In consequence of these things, he remarked, great and threatening evils had already appeared in our Zion. The stability of our churches and the efficiency of our ministry are greatly endangeredk and he felt called upon to take a firm stand against the facilities which of late have largely multiplied for destroying the usefulness of pastors, for the purpose of effecting a change of ministry. He was convinced something ought to be attempted to stop the progress of the disorganizing spirit which had of late affected our churches. He was fully convinced that a public manifestation of the conduct of churches who make it necessary by their own conduct for their pastors to leave would operate to deter from such conduct; and therefore he had not heeded the partial hints of some of his people in the first place, and their less gentle manifesta- tions in the last place, that by giving up his pastorate to a new incumbent he would be conferring a favor upon his people. He felt that he would not work with those who for no cause, and against cause, were striving for his ruin among the people of his charge. It was his belief that, if they took ththe laboring oar, it was best that they alone, without his help, should use it. Because of these convic- tions, he remarke:d this ecclesiastical council has been con- voked to examine into the state of our affairs and to ad- vise to the proper course for all parties to pursue. The council then required of the committee a statement of the difficulties in which both pastor and people were involved and in relation to which advice was sought.   322     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. This requisition was met by the chairman, one of the deacons of the church, who arose and remarked that " the people in this place have for some months past been agi- tated by dissatisfaction with their pastor. It was hoped," he continued, " that, when the pastor was made acquainted with such dissatisfaction, he would see it most for his comrn- fort and usefulness to seek some other field of labor; but he paid no attention to complaints, and continued, after he was apprised of them, to go on as usual. He was, as a last resort, requested to unite in a council;e or, rather, he proposed himself to submit the matter to a council, and the proposition was acceded to by the church; and thus it is why this council has been called. We have been advised by our pastor that the council would expect complaints to be submitted in writing ; and so the committee have drawn them up, and have furnished the pastor with a copy of the same." l The first charge is, that the pastor neglected to visit his people. The second, that he was not prompt in the payment of his debts. He promised to pay, and did not fulfil his agreement. The third was, that the pastor failed in his pulpit per- formances, and did not maintain weekly prayer meetings. The fourth was, that the pastor's usefulness in this place is at an end. These several charges were supported with all the tes- timony that could be obtained by the committee, and then the pastor was called upon to defend himself. Accord- ingly he addressed himself at once to the work before him, and remarked, that in relation to the first charge, that of visiting the people, he would say, that he had pur- sued that course which his judgment admonished him was wise and proper. "The people in this place, as a general thing, wish for as little attention from a minister in his   CALL TO ANOTHER COUNCIL.      323 professional character as possible. They are ready enough to -see him as a man, provided they are not engaged in their worldly business, which is not very often the case except in very stormy weather; but to see him as a religious teacher, as one who comes to them to converse on the great interests of the soul, they are strongly and peculiarly disin- clined. When I first came among them I began a course of visitation, as I was in the habit of pursuing in my-min- istry in the first place of my settlement. I soon met with very seriou -obstacles; but, feeling that I might be instru- mental in the accomplishment of good, I persevered and went through, visiting all the people to whom I could get access. To some I could get no access. When I was seen approaching, certain families would close and bolt their doors, and suffer me to, wait and :knock for admis- sion in vain. Others would leave the house and conceal themselves, as they supposed, from my eye. I well remem- ber teing in a certain neighborhood, and, as I was about to enter a certain house, seeing the man of that house at the door as I approached it. When I entered the house, and whilst I sat therein, he was not to be seen. In answer to my inquiries after him, I was told he was somewhere about; but neither wife nor child moved to look him up. Finishing my visit, and wishing to call on another family, my quickest route lay back of this house, over fences and walls. I therefore took such route, and, as I passed out, looking about me, I. saw, crouching down under an out building, the man, whom I wished to see and who ran of as I came up to his:house. There I saw him, looking as a truant child looks when endeavoring to conceal himself from a parent or some one else who was in search of him. I had no doubt then, I have no doubt now, that this indi- vidual concealed himself there to be out of my way; for when I looked to this plade of his concealment he started, and there was shame on his countenance. He was not t-,   324    -A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. expecting me back of the house. He thought, as I en. tered, so I should depart, through the front door. This scene made a most deep impression on my mind, and it gave me the general character of the people; and I am sorry to say that my subsequent acquaintance with them has not altered this impression. With a minister of the gospel they wish to have as little to do as possible. I have felt that time spent in going from house to house here, where the disinclination is so general to hear any thing said on the subject of personal religion, was time thrown away. Whenever and wherever I :culd visit to profit I have done so. "As to the next complaint, that I have broken my word in regard to money matters, I have to remark, that I have often engaged to pay sundry bills at a time which was always past the lperiod when my salary was due. The individuals to whom I was indebted knew that I was de- pendent upon the promptness of the people to be prompt myself; and I have not till recently heard that any blame I was attached to me for delinquency. , The backwardness of the people in not paying my salary I have often heard most severely censured ; and, too, I have often heard the wonder expressed how I could get along as I did when not a quarter part of the half-year's salary was paid when the next half year had expired. I own that I have not paid my debts as promptly as I agreed ; but I agreed to pay them on the faith -of the promptitude of the people. As they have been backward and are now greatly in arrears to me, I submit it to the council if a complaint against me for breaking my word in this matter comes urit a good grace from them. "In relation to the next charge, that of failure in my pulpit performances, I would remark, that H have never equalled my- wishes in this respect. I did not equal them when I preached to this people as a candidate, nor in the 9  ,   CALL TO ANOTREI' COUNCIL.     325 four years when the reports came to me and went forth abroad from the people here that they had the smartest man in the association. I think there has been no falling off in the power of my preaching. I have endeavored, to the best of my ability, to preach faithfully and to bring no unbeaten oil into the, sanctuary. I have with me here the sermons I prepared and preached during the year end- ing the last Sabbath, thirty-six in number; and I can have here thirty-nine sermons I prepared and preached the pre- vious year, for the inspection of the council; and there are individuals of intelligence and education who will testify that, in "their opinion, instead of having failed ia my pulpit performances, I have advanced from year to year in interest. I think, after thE council shall have heard their testimony, they will determine that ly oppo- nents have altogether failed in substantiating this charge. As it respects the discontinuance of th-e:,weekly prayer meeting, I would say, that I did so because there were but two or three who would come together for ithe service. I ever have felt the importance of these meetings- have felt the need of them for my own profit and encourage- ment, and for the good of the church and the benefit of the people ; but from the first there has been a disinclina- tion on the part of the church to attend upon them. I have preached on the subject. When I have notified these meetings from the pulpit, I have often urged the necessity and importance of their being attended. I have con- versed in private with the, members of the church in rela- tion to their own duty to attend the prayer meetings; and yet they have not been attended. Often I have been to the place of prayer and not an individual was to be seen. The fact is, the brethren of the church are bound up in the world, and have no heart to pray, I fear. As to the last charo, that my usefulness is at an end in this place, I would say, that I fear it is if the present feel- 28   326'    A VOICE FROM THE- PARSONAGE. ing continues. But how has it been destroyed? I think I canbth'row some light on this matter. For four years it ! was generally acknowledged that I was just the man for this people. All--- said thiS And now, how has my useful- ness been destroyed in the last two years?- which is the time my opponents allege that I have not been useful here. ! About two years ago I felt it to be my duty to preach on certain subjects and rebuke certain sins. I felt called upon thus to do by the good of the people. I did this, and many, very many, there were who expressed them- selves gratified at my course, and who gave it as their opinion that good would be the consequence. There was one man, however, who took exceptions to my preaching. He thought I was personal, and he became actively op- posed to me. The fact was, I never thought of this indi- vidual in particular when I preached the sermons to which he was so much opposed. It was the farthest from my design to hold him up, as he alleges that I did, as on the highway to the world of torment. I have told him this, and I have told others this, before; but he would have it that I preached to him, and would not be pacified or reasoned with. Being a man of wealth, he had influence. A number of the people here ere indebted to, and felt their dependence, in a measure, upon him. There were some such in the church; one of the deacons is of this number; and this- individual resolved on my dismission, and he went to work accordingly to effect it. He went to the deacon, who- was largely indebted to him, and told him that I must leave. He represented to him that many here were dissatisfied, and he succeeded in souring the mind of the deacon towards me and in making him an in- strument to aid him in the work on which he was bent. The deacon began to exert an influence to my disadvan- tage. Of course he was listened to, and what he said to others had weight.- In this way has it come to pass that   CALL TO ANOTHER COUNCIL.      3 327 my usefulness is at an end ; not by my neglect of duty, but by myfidelity, as I fully believe. Had I preached so as to have disturbed no one's conscience or heart, I verily believe those who were the first to proclaim that my usefulness was at an end here would have been silent." Various individuals were called upon by the pastor, who fully substantiated his remarks in relation to all the charges which had been adduced against him. It was evident that his opponents were not prepared for such a general raking up of their conduct, and had not anticipated that what they had said in the ear would be proclaimed on the house tops. Some who looked on thought that they read in their looks that, if they had supposed that their course to ruin and destroy a pastor would have been thus known, they would have been still and not have engaged in this work of meanness.         ' : The parties, having made to the council all the exposi- tion they desired of the difficulties in which they were involved, were left by this body, who adjourine'd for private deliberation from the vestry, where they had thus far met, to a private house. Here they were in session several hours, carefully considering the testimony which had been given in touching all the charges which had been pre- ferred against the pastor. At length the church bell rang, as a signal that the council were prepared to communicate the result' of their deliberations, and in a little time the vestry was filled-with people. "The moderator remarked that the council, wish- ing to act fairly and impartially, had taken time to go over all the facts in the case and to examine carefully all the testimony which had been offered. For this reason, their session in private had been protracted. He was happy to state that the council had been harmonious in their views, and had unanimously come to the result which the scribe would now read. g?   328     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE.        I.  From this document it appeared that the council, in view of the evidence submitted, took the same view of the propriety and expediency of the pastor's visiting his people which he presented. If the people would not give atten- tion to conversation on the subject of religion, if it was manifest that they resorted to any measures to avoid it, they had no right to expect of their minister that he would consume his time in mere social visitation. In respect to his not fulfilling his pecuniary engagements, the council could not see how it was possible for him so to do when thls people were so remiss in paying him what was his due. Had they gpromptly fillfilled their obligations to him, and he had biln backward in discharging his own liabilities to any of his people, there would have been ground of severe censure. Before a pastor can pay out his people must pay in to him; and it is unreasonable and un- righteous for them to complain, as they were aware that he was not in the receipt of his salary. In relation to any failure on the part of the pastor in his pulpit:prformances, the council, from the testimony given and from: the exam- ination of the discourses submitted to them, are happy to feel that the pastor has been advancing both in literary merit and theological knowledge and ability to preach. Of the allegation that the pastor's usefulness to his people is at an end, the council are pained to acknowledge that in their- opinion such is the fact. They feel, however, that this usefulness has been destroyed by reason of the efforts of some of his people. Fromi the testimony brought for- ward, it is evident that one individual began this work of destruction when goaded up by a guilty conscience under the faithful preaching of the pastor, and that this individual, through his position in society and his relations to many of the people, was successful in making instruments for the furtherance of his own evil designs of some who ought to -have been the pastor's most zealous supporters and friends.   The way in which the pastor's influence and usefulness is at an end here would destroy the usefulness of every pastor in the land. No minister could stand before the attempts which have here been made to destroy him ; and the council cannot refrain from expressing their most decided con- demnation of the artifice of some, and servility of others, by which difficulties here have been created and continued. The council would exhort those who have been, by decep- tion or through fear, induced to take up weapons against a beloved and worthy minister of Christ, to pause and reflect upon the sinfulness of their conduct, and -'epent. The council are of the opinion that iepastor can' no longer be useful among his present pe0ple unless there is a manifest change of feeling on the part of those through whose instrumentality his usefulness has been destroyed; and, therefore, they recommend that his pastoral relation be dissolved. After the result had been read the council adjourned and the memibers dispersed to their respective homes. Whilst Mr. Eldridge, and his delegate, Dr. Howard, were riding towards their home, considerable conversation-was had in relation to the matters which had occupied their attention whilst they were present in council. Whilst thus conversing, the doctor remarked,- "What an easy thing it is to dismiss a minister! Only let one or two individuals of any standing in a parish set themselves at work, and they will succeed in dismissing any minister in the state." "There is much truth in that remark," Mr. Eldridge said. "It is strange people will be led away as they are; that they will lend a helping hand to a work which is so often productive of so many evils as the dismission of a faithful pastor often occasions both to himself and family and his people likewise." "It is strange'" the doctor said, "men of sense do not- 28 * 330     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE, see such evils and at once nip all attempts made to encircle difficulties around a minister. It might be done if people felt as they ought." "That is true," Mr. Eldridge remarked ; "and, before we 1 shall have a permanent ministry, the course you suggest will have to be pursued." -  "Well," said the doctor, "one thing has puzzled me j some- the course some ministers who have been dis. I missed and who remain in the parish pursue. I should think, of all men, they would be the last to do any thing to make the situation of their successor uncomfortable. Yet I find they are sometimes foremost in making a disturb- ance. Now, there is Mr. Packard; he must leave his people." "Brother Packard a-going to leave his people I "Mr. El- dridge exclaimed. "I am astonished." "I was at his parish last week visiting some patients, and I learned that he was going away." "For what?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "O, there is trouble there. t The people, some of them, think he might be m6"e;useful somewhere else. From all that Ibcould gather, I made up my mind that the principal source- of opposition to him was in his predecessor and his family." "Oho I that cannot be," Mr. Eldridge said. "The old gentleman is a man who would not be guilty of doing any thing to injure Mr. Packard." "I do not know ; but some of the people told me that he and his children were thought to be opposed to Mr. Packard. They were very intimate with a few who are openly opposed to him." "Well, I do not know but that it is so," Mr. Eldridge said; " it may be. I remember now hearing brother Pack- ard say that Mr. Worcester was not very attentive to him, and that his family were rather cold and distant. But I   CALL TO ANOTHER COUNCIL.      331 thought nothing more of it. He said this two or three years ago." "The people there say," the doctor remarked, "that Mr. Worcester and his children want to have Mr. Packard turned away because they dismissed Mr. Worcester." "O, I cannot think that such is the feeling of Mr. Worces- ter and his children," Mr. Eldridge said. "Mr. Packard always speaks highly of Mr. Worcester, and I have noticed that they frequently come together to the meetings of our association." "Well," said the doctor, "I believe that; if JMr. Worcester and family had not exerted a secret inme against JMr. Packard, there would not have been ;any very serious trouble in his parish. I form my opinion of what some of the best people there-say; and I think it very strange, after the treatment which Mr. Worcester received, that he and his children should do what they all condemned so freely in others."' It was not long after this conversation before Mr. El- 1 dridge and Mr. Packard met. The latter was about being dismissed, and he fully admitted bt r. Eldridge that a great cause of the trouble with him Was in the cour:s ur- sued among a certain portion of the people by his predecessor and children. -;              . .   CHAPTER XXIX. THE OTH'tK STORE. AROUND the meeting house of Mr. Eldridge much of a village existed. From the taste displayed in the location of the houses, in the construction of the fences, and in the multiplication of shade trees and shrubbery of different variety, the village had acquired much celebrity in the region for its beauty and-loveliness. There had ever been one store by the meeting house, filled with every variety of merchandise that was necessary for the supply of the wants of the community. For many years this store had been in the occupancy of Squire Davidson, in whose fair and honorable dealing all had the fullest confidence. As he grew rich- by trade, another individual thought that he would attempt the making of a fortune in the same way. Consequently, he built and furnished a store about two years before the settlement of Mr. Eldridge; but, not being of a  commercial mould, instead of making, he lost money by the transaction, and gave up the business. For several years the store remained closed. It was, however, opened again by a young man of enterprise and piety when Mr. Eldridge was in the seventh year of his pastor- ate; and it yielded to its proprietor a handsome profit, though by no means equal to that which Squire Davidson received. Such profits as his were not expected ; for the business transacted was not near as large as that prose- (332)   THE OTHER STORE.       333 cuted by the squire. Between the occupant of this store (Mr. Fowler) and Mr. Eldridge'there was ever the utmostc kindness of feeling, and no exceptions ,whatever were taken to the pastor's trading with Squire Davidson.   ,, When Mr. Eldridge had been settled about sixteen years, x - ;: Mr. Fowler was taken suddenly away, and, in the settle- ment of his estate, it became necessary to sell the store. Colonel Presbury was the purchaser. It was soon re- opened by a gentleman with the name of Dixon, who had much of the spirit of trade and was anxious for all that he could command. As a matter ,of course he was an at- tendant on the preaching of Mr. Eldridge, and was often heard to say pretty things of the minister, especially when he thought they would reach the pastor's ears. A store in the country has frequently many visitors in the evening. Some individuals, being busy all the day, find it most for their convenience to purchase their little articles of: every-day consumption in the evening; and other individuals are in the habit of making-such tg place their resort for the purpose of hearing the current news. Boys, too, often happen in, to gratify an idle curiosity or to make some little purchases. MYr. Dixon had been in business a little more than a year, when a son of Mr. Clay, accompanied by a nephew of Mr. Eldridge, who had been in town but a few years, entered the store in the evening. They were passing along, and seeing a number of people therein, and hearing loud laughing pnid merriment, it was natural for them to stop and see what was going on. So many being together, they were probably unobserved, or, if observed by some near the door, they could not have been seen farther along, where the scene of conversation was. They had not been there long before they heard Mr. Dixon remark,--- "Well, I can't get over it that Mr. Eldridge does all his trading over at the squire's."   8834    A VOICE FPOM THE PARSONAGE. "Don't you know the reason of this?" a good-natured gentleman, Mr. Crane, inquired. "Yes, I suppose I do," Mr. Dixon said. "The squire is a greathman among us, and Mr. Eldridge thinks he must f keep the right side of him, or else he'll have trouble." o"You are greatly mistaken, friend Dixon, if you -upF  pose that is the reason. It is no such thing. The squire, I am told, always sells Mr. Eldridge his goods .at cost, and, when he settles his bill, always makes him a hand. some discount." "Yes," said Mr. Billings; " that is a fact, I believe. I always understood it so. Mr. Fowler used to say that was the case, and' he said he did not blame Mr. Eldridge in the least. The squire was able to be liberal, he said; and, for his part, he was glad that he showed the minister so great a favor." "I should think," Mr. Otis said, " as long as Mr. Dixon has just begun here, that Mr. Eldridge ought to buy some of his things of him, just to encourage him. You know it would have influence on others; for many people would be influenced to do their-trading here if the parson pat- ronized the-store." "Yes," said Mr. Dixon ; "that is it. I dare say the squire gets custom by being generous to the minister. He gets good pay for allI that he sells Mr. Eldridge, I'll be bound." ' O," Mr. Crane said, " it don't make a cent's difference in the business of Mr, Davidson by having the custom of Mr. Eldridge. He would sell just as much if Mr. Eldridge bought all his goods out of town. The squire keeps a great store, has been in business a great while, and people like to trade there; and they would trade there as much as they do now if Mr. Eldridge did not buy any thing of him." "Well, I don't like it," Mr. Dixon said, "not to have   THE OTHER STORE.       335 the minister trade here some. I would do well by him. I could not afford to sell exactly at cost; but then I would give him good bargains."' "If I were in your place,"' Mr. Crane observed, "I would not say any thing about not having the patronage of Mr. Eldridge. He has a good many friends here, you know; and you might be injured yourself through their influence, if they should know you said hard things of the nminister." "I don't know about that," Mr. Dixon said. ",I think a minister ought- to patronize all who hear him preach, and I find others think so too. There is the colonel:; he was in here the other day talking about it, and he said that Mr. Eldridge did wrong in not trading with me some. I rather think, if the parson don't trade here, he'll wish he had." Mr. Dixon's attention being directed towards one or two customers who addressed him with considerable im- patience at the delay he caused them in being thus en- grossed in conversation, he at once dropped the subject and proceeded to wait upon them. The son of Mr. Clay thereupon left the store and returned home highly excited, and related to his parents what he had heard. "Is it possible," his mother said," that Mr. Dixon would: allow himself to talk in this manner?" "Yes," Mr. Clay remarked; "I should expect that he would feel and talk pretty much as Thomas says. He is a man of a very nervous temperament, I should judge -by what little I have seen of him, and not of very enlarged views, and with a strong passion for gain. I am not at all astonished that he should express: himself as he has." "He may be of great injury to Mr. Eldridge," Mrs. Clay observed./ "He probably has acquired a strong prejudice against Mr. Eldridge; and, by his talking as he did this evening, we must infer that he is in the habit of speaking   336    -A -VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE, "Yes," Mr. Clay said; "Mr. Dixon will undoubtedly endeavor to prejudice people against our pastor, and un- doubtedly he will succeed to some extent. It is very un. s fortunate,that he is not such a man as Mr. Fowler--a man who is capable of taking a right view of a thing, and  not entirely bound up in self-interest."        "Mr. Fowler never took any exceptions to Mr. El- g dridge's trading with Squire Davidson, did he, dear?" "No, not he," Mr. Clay replied. "I have heard him  speak on the subject again and again; and he uniformly expressed himself happy that it was in the power of the squire to treat Mr. Eldridge with so much generosity, and at the same time regretted that his circumstances did not allow him to do as much. He said that he should do as Mr. Eldridge did were he in his situation." "Mr. Fowler was a lovely man," Mrs. Clay remarked; "and it is a great pity that one so unlike him should take  his place in the store." *  "Well," Mr. Clay said, rising from his chair and begin- ning to pace the floor, "I am extremely sorry that Mr. Dixon ever came here, if this is the way he is going to act. He will exert an influence that will be very much to Mr. Eldridge's disadvantage, I am afraid. Of course, as he keeps a store, he will see a large number of people, and he will have it in his power to say a great many things against Mr. Eldridcge, which will be believed, and of course which will affect the feelings of the people hear- ing, and sour them towards the minister. Whenever any persons become a little excited by any thing which Mr. Eldridge may say or do, they will have a place to go for sympathy ; and- Mr, Dixon's store will be a sort of rendez- vous for such as may be inclined to make trouble in the parish. I dare say Mr. Otis and Mr. Andrews have found out that he feels sore, and tha:t they are in his store pretty often; and, if Mr. Scott were alive, he would be there too."   THE OTHER STORE.       337 ' Mr. Otis was in the store to-night, father," Thomas re- marked. "There, that's it"Mr. Clay said. "Was not Mr. An- drews likewise?"           ?  "I did not see him," Thomas replied. ",Yes," Mr. Clay said. "Such characters as -Mr. Otis - and'Mr. Andrews will be in there almost every even- ing, and they will talk about Mr. Eldridge and set all his conduct out in the worst possible manner; and un- doubtedly they will succeed in bringing over to their views and feelings quite a number of people in the course of a little time."  "O husband," Mrs. Clay said, "if people find out that Mr. Dixon is so much opposed to Mr. Eldridge they will not visit his store." "That may be the case with many individuals," Mr. Clay said, - '"th such individuals as act from principle, -but, you know,'there are more of the opposite character in the world than such. It -is greatly to be-lamented that, when we have- but two stores in town, one of these should be kept by an individual like this Mr. Dixon." "There is the tavern," Mrs. Clay said. "People go in there and talk; and, if they were inclined to talk against Mr. Eldridge, they could go there and do so." "Indeed they could not, if Mr. Shipleyj was about," Mr.'  Clay said. "He would have no such men in his house as were inclined to run out against Mr. Eldridge." "Does Mr. Dixon own that store, husband, or does he hire it' of Mrs. Fowler?"Mrs. Clay inquired. "The store was sold soon after Mr. Fowler died," Mr. Clay remarked, "and Colonel Presbury bought it." "Ah, I never heard of that," Mrs. Clay said. "Then Colonel Presbury owns the store. Well, he won!t object to his tenant's course, will:f-- husband?" ," No, not in the least. We know how the colonel has 29   338     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. felt towards Mr. Eldridge ever since he had to pay one hundred and sixty dollars for removing that old parish debt. I (dare say Mr. Dixon has discovered how the colo- nel weels, and that he is emboldened by him in the course pursuing. It may be Mr. Dixon acts according to ructi6s from the colonel," "Yes," Thomas said. "Mr. Dixon told Mr.' Crane this evening that the colonel said Mr. Eldridge ought to do a part of his trading at his store, and that he did not like it at all that he did not." "Mr. Dixon said this, Thomas, did he?"Mr. Clay asked. "There is no doubt, then, that the colonel en- courages Mr. Dixon. I should not be surprised if :it was a plan of the colonel to purchase that store andlhave it occupied by a man whom he could use as an instrument to disturb Mr. Eldridge. It certainly looks like it." "Yes; I think it does," Mrs. Clay said; -' but then the colonel cannot expect to harm Mr. Eldridge very serious- ly. He knows how attached the people are to their minis- ter, and that any opposition of a few could not essentially injure him." "I don't know about that," Mr. Clay replied. "A con- tinual-dropping wears the stone. Colonel Presbury is a man of property, and, if he really is determined to exert bhimself against Mr. Eldridge, he can do him much harm. Mr. Dixon's store will be the place, I am persuaded, where great mischief Will be done." "Colonel Presbury has not more property than Squire Davidson and some others here who are friendly to Mr.? Eldridge. Deacon Smith is as wealthy as the colonel," Mrs. Clay said. "These persons can outdo the colonel if influence is to be measured by property; and so there will not be much for Mr. Eldridge- really to' fear. There is no man in town wiho has the influence which the squire has."'   ...TH' OTHER STORE.     339 "The squire:isgrowing old, you know, and his health is failing, and he e'cannot be expected to remain with us long," Mr. Clay remarked. i "I know that, my dear," Mrs. Clay replied ; " but'then: . ^a if his son Charles moves on, as he probably will:n; (':r;' spring, he will take his father's place, I dare say. :o:  know he is a great friend to Mr. Eldridge, and he would?,-;-I on his own, and on his mother and father's account, exed : himself with all his might to prevent any injury being done Mr.. Eldridge by Mr. Dixon or the colonel." "That is all true," Mr. Clay said; " but perhaps he will not come on; his wife, I thought, was opposed to it; and, if he .should, he could not exert the influence his father has exerted." "He will come on in the spring, I know," Mrs. Clay said. "When Frances (Mrs. Howard) called here yester- day she toldJ me that Charles: wife had altered her feel- ings, and that she thought they ought to move on, as the squire wishes them to do so much." "Well, that will be a-grand thing for the parish if Charles should take up his residence here," Mr. Clay said. "He is thought much of by many people here, and he is a man of energy and decision,-very much like his;;father. A man in the employ of Mr. Clay entered the ro0om and announced that an accident had happened at the barn, which of course suspended further conversation. The reader, however, will know more of the other store by and by.   CHAPTER XXX. REPAIRING THE CHURCH. WHATEVER might have been attempted at "'the other store" or in any other quarter for two or three years after Mr. Dixon commenced business- for creating a dis- turbance in the prospects of Mr. Eldridge, yet no prog- ress was reported which reached the general circles of the parish. The pastor preached his eighteenth anniversary discourse, feeling that his hold on the affections of his people was as stqong as at any past period of his miiis- try. In the course of this sermon allusion was made to a i variety of local matters touching the prosperity of both  church and parish, and a gentle hint was given that it might well for- the people to consider that both age and fashion had given to the sanctuary of their fathers and -their own somewhat of a peculiar appearance, which might be remedied by the application of some of the im- proved forms of church architecture. If other parts of the sermon failed to lodge in the minds and hearts of his hear- ers, certain it was that thishint was remembered. It was' - the very thing which the younger part of the parish had long wanted to be sounded from the pulpit; for they : thought the'fathers would hear it and be excited to move  in the matter of making their house of worship i:ime con-  venient, more attractive, and more in conformity to church- / es which had recently been erected. There was nothing (340)  '  -'   REPAIRING THE CHURCH.      341 about this church which denoted neglect. It had been well cared for. Both the carpenter and the painter had been there as often as their services were in the least, needed,; but it had the disadvantage of age. It had- stood thirty-five years. The pulpit was high, the galleries were high, the slips were high and roomy; and, besides, there had never. beei heard within itstwalls the sound of the organ. If the old folks had no]tqobserved all these things'and mourned over them, the youing people had; and - it was a cause of great rejoicing to them when their pastor gently hinted that the advancement which had recently been made in the art of architecture might do much to- wards the improvement of their own sanctuary. As might be expected, a new subject began to be agi- tated in all the circles of the parish; and, because there were advocates of the measure in almost every house, it became absolutely indispensable to parochial quietude that-it should receive some official notice. It had been suggested that the expense attendant on the repairing of- the church could be met by subscription, and thus it would throw no burden on unwilling shoulders; but as the meeting house was parish property, and as every thing pertaining to eccle- siastical expenditures had from time immemorial; in that parish been settled from the parish treasury, such iggges- tion did not meet with very popular favor. It was:urged by some few who were apprised of the effect which the parish tax for the liquidation of the old parish debt-had upon a certain individual, that, as the sore had not yet healed over, it might be politic not to make a tatl for the object, but to have the expense borne by those who were disposed to contribute; but the people generally were too demo- cratic, and at last it was given over in private where the matter had thus far been only discussed, and it was thought that, if the church was to be repaired, it must be done at the parish expense.  29 *   842     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. A parish meeting was at length called for the consider- ation of this matter, and the attendance was large. The first question which came up was upon the necessity of repairing the house. Upon this there was considerable debate. Some thought the house was well enough as it was. Some thought it might be well to make the pews a little narrower, for it would increase their number, and more were wanted; but the greater number who participated in the debate went for a thorough repair and remodelling of the house. At last the motion was made to remodel the house, and to furnish it with an organ which should not cost rdbre than eighteen hundred dollars. The expense of remodelling the house had been set at about seven hundred dollars ; and it was thought that twenty-five hundred would do the whole. Hitherto the debate had been on the article in the war- rant to see if the parish will repair the meeting house and furnish it with an organ. Now the question caiAe a little closer to the pockets, and of course a little nearer the hearts, of certain individuals at least. After this motion was made, Colonel Presbury had the floor first. He had no objection to remodelling the church and having it furnished.,with an organ. He was in favor of the project, provin!eg it could be accomplished in a proper manner. He had -no doubt money enough could be raised, and it was his opinion that it would be best for the parish to have a subscription taken for the object rather than make a tax. He was ready to subscribe liberally, and he had no doubt that every member of the parish would do the same; and if all had the privilege of giving what they pleased, there would be no cause for trouble. Besides, he said, there were many who attended meeting here who did not belong to the parish, and these would put down something i whereas, if a tax were made, we should lose this amount. Mr, Crane, a gentleman of a very peaceable turn of   REPAIRING THE CHURCH.      343 mind, and wished every individual accommodated, next rose, and remarked, that he cared not how the repairs were effected, whether by tax or subscription. He was for having people satisfied. As the colonel was a man of considerable property, he thought it might be well to hear him, and have a subscription paper opened, assenting to his suggestion. Mr. Otis, who always preferred subscription papers to taxes, because he could get off with less money, and fre- quently with no money at all, by being opposed to theob- ject subscribed for, was in favor of the colonel's plan, and hoped it would be adopted. Several others advocated it with much energy; but then there were those who strongly opposed it. Squire Davidson, though in feeble health, rallied himself and made a long speech in favor of having the house repaired bya tax. So did his son, who had taken up his abode in the parish, having removed from the south a year and a half before. Deacon Smith, Mr. Clay, Dr. Howard, all advocated a tax; and when the vote was taken sixty-three were in favor of a tax and eleven opposed; so the house was to be remodelled and furnished with an organ at the expense of the parish. After the declaration of the vote, some who understood the colonel's physiognomy saw, as they thought, soime fore- shadowing' of trouble expressed therein. However, they kept their own secrets, and whispered not abroad what they surmised, but kept an eye out in watch' after his movements. Mr. Clay thought there would be some ex- plosion that evening at Mr. Dixon's store; and so he made ;  some errand for his hired man, who was of an intelligent cast, and sent him down to perform it. As he was going out of the yard Mr. Clay called to him and said,- "John, perhaps there will be something said at the store about the parish meeting this afternoon. If there should be you can stay a while and hear, and let-me know."   344     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. John went on, and when he arrived at the store he found that there were quite a number of people there; and as he went in he heard much loud talking and saw some angry faces, which led him to conclude some unpleasant subject was being discussed. He soon heard some one say, who he did not know,-       - "Well, I think this business will finish him up in these parts." "Yes," Mr. Dixon said, "I think it will; that's a fact. A minister had better let alone what don't concern him. As for putting up the people to lay out two or three thou- sand dollars on the me6eing house he preaches in, just to make it look grand, helli find is rather poor business." "Have I not said once or twice here this evening," Mr. Parker remarked, "that it was a minister's duty to urge his people to do what he thought would be for their pres- ent and future good? -Mr. Eldridge has not made the people repair the meeting house. -They voted to do this because .they thought they had a right to do as they pleased. If they had taken no notice of what he said in his sermon he would not have thought it strange. He merely touched them up a little about the meeting house, and they took the hint, and have voted to do Something handsome for the church. I think this blaming the minis- ter for what the parish does is rather unreasonable and very silly." "It is bad that they are going to make a tax for this business," Colonel Presbury said. "I am afraid it will make bad business. The whole thing might be done by subscription, and then there would be no. hard feelings." "You don't know that, colonel," Mr. Parker said. "It seems there were only eleven who were opposed to a tax and sixty-three in favor of one.. You are not sure that there would not have been very,hard feelings in some of these sixty-three if- they could not have had a tax. We must let the majority govern in this country." As,.              j   REPAIRING THE CHURCB,      345 "Well, I insist upon it, this taxing people to pay parish expenses is not politic," the colonel said. "Our people here don't think so," Mr. Parker said. "We have always done this, you know; and there are not many parishes about who have less trouble than ours." "I know we have got along tolerably well,' the colonel said ;" but I am afraid we sha'n't much longer." "What is going to happen, colonel?"Mr. Parker asked. "O, I do not know that any thing will; but perhaps, if you and I both live a few: ears longer, we may see." "You don't mean to sign off, colonel, do you?"Mr. Parker inquired, "Sign offl No, indeed I " the colonel replied, with much feeling; " that is not my way. I have belonged to the parish ever since I was one and twenty, and my father before me always: was a member of the parish; and I rather think I shall stick by it as long as I live." "I am glad to hear you talk so," Mr. Parker said. "We should be sorry to lose you, colonel." After this manner did conversation run for an hour or more; and John, thinking he understood the drift of the discussion, took up his bundle which he had purchased and proceeded homeward. Entering the room where Mr. Clay was, and giving up his purchase, he turned to go out, when Mr. Clay said,- "Well, John, were there many at the store to-night?  "'Pretty good number of youngsters there," John said, "but not more than six or seven men," "Well, what was the topic to-night?" "They were talking about fixing/the meeting house," Johna said. "Well, what did they say?" John then went, on and narrated what he could remem.   346     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONIGE. her, much of which conversation has been given above, and then left the room. "I knew," Mr. Clay observed to his wife, "there would be some sparring at Dixon's to-night, and I made an er- rand and sent John down. He understands"' "I could not think what your object was in sending after nails to-night," Mrs. Clay replied, " when you sent by me this afternoon to the squire's after them, and I brought home ten pounds." "O, nails always come right. I could not think of any thing else we wanted ;Ji d .fI told John he might get on to Jerry and go totD  to get a couple of pounds of board nails, and thia  ight stay a while if there should be any excitable conversation going on." "I suppose you consider yourself paid by the report John has brought back?"Mrs. Clay said. "I am not at all disappointed at hearing what he says. I knew the colonel was sore, and I eitted to hear from him, through Dixon and his tribe." I: "I suppose," Mrs. Clay said, " we must expect to have trouble; but I hope it will not be very- disastrous. I have strong confidence in the good sense of our people and in the strength of their attachment to Mr. Eldridge. It is not uncommon, we know, for a few people to be un- easy in a parish and for such to attempt to make disturb- ance.  We have been as much blessed in having aslittle of this kind of trouble as almost any other parish with which I am acquainted." "I hope we shall get along with this business better than I fear," Mr. Clay said. "I feel that Mr. Presbury is very much excited about this tax, and that he will in some way or other make all the trouble which he can. That he will have influence over many there can be no doubt; and if he be not reconciled in some way he will un- doubtedly exert all his influence, I fear, to displace Mr. Eldridge."    -REPAIRING THE CHURCH.      347 "I suppose," Mrs. Clay remarked, " he will attempt to vent his feelings in that way-; but it will be very wicked in him to do this. Mr. Eldridge is not to blame for what the parish does." "No, not in the least. But the colonel reasons that, if Mr. Eldridge had not moved in the matter of paying that old parish debt, it would not have been paid, and so he would" not have been taxed ; and that, if Mr. Eldridge had not brought up the subject of repairing the meeting house, the people would not have thought of so doing. He thus blames Mr. Eldridge for 3' i -the cause of these two things, which take from hir ab  le- money; and so, I fear, he means to punish I dridge and others by making a strong move to have him dismissed.7 "O, well, if the people stand firm, I do not think he will be able to accomplish: much," said Mrs. Clay. "Of course he -will not," Mr. Clay said; "but a man like the colone1niic weaken the firmness of some men. The danger is, if::[iihi colonel takes a bold standiand it be known that he is opposed to Mr. Eldridge and desires his dismission, that others, in some fitful moment of displeas- ure, will join him; and, being once committed, they cannot retrace their steps, however they might desire to do this when cool reflection comes to their aid. This danger I have apprehended ever since it came to our ears that the colonel was disturbed about the parish- debt; and I have talked to you before in a manner similar:to my present mode of expression." "O, yes, dear, I know you have; but, then, I ever looked upon the possibility of the colonel's really starting as remote, and did not treasure up y(r fears as I am now inclined to do."       "1 In accordance with the parish vote, the committee forth-   348     A VOICE FROM- THE PARSONAGE. with proceeded to put it into execution. Having visited several churches, both in city and country, and consulted different architects, they at length determined on a plan, and an energetic master workman had the enterprise in hand. When he first began on the interior of the church materials were being collected by an eminent musical es- tablishment for the construction of the organ:; and in less than seven months from the vote to repair the work was accomplished. Through the skilful and most judicious management of the committee, the entire revolution in the aspect was so pleasing to all, and the pay day was so adroitly set, that nothing was heard- by way of dissatisfac- tion. The organ, too, took charmingly; and even Mr. Otis was heard to say--though he made the remark when he was not aware that certain ears were near - that it was a capital thing in Mr. Eldridge to put the people up to this thing. The colonel, too, inasmuch as the house had been beautified to his acknowledged :satisfaction, and at an expense below his computation, without, as yet, any call from his purse, could talk of the improvements with composure and even with some degree of pride. All were so pleased that Mr. Dixon's store was even for a while silent about " breaking up the parish," &c., and every one almost felt and said their parish was about the best in the land. The new and splendid clock which had not been thought of when the vote to. -:air was takeh, nor while the work was :in progress, but rich had been presented and put in its appropriate place before the eye of the preacher when the carpets were being -put down by the generosity of Mr. Charles Davidson, had a wonderful effect in removing the chill from many hearts, and in put- ting smiles on many faces which had been cold and sullen for months. However, notwithstanding the expense attending these  .- i   REPAIRING THE CHURCH.      349 things was gradually paid, yet in the course of two years each man knew how much he had been taxed and had paid for the repairs of the church. Then old feelings, which many thought were extinguished, began to appear in a few. The colonel was often. heard to utter hard things. Mr. Dixon's store rang again with dark sayings; and fear was on many hearts that trouble might yet come.   *        , CHAPTER XXXI. THE DEACON'S SON. THE happy influence exerted by Mr. Eldridge over the lambs of the flock was not among the slightest reasons  which fostered the attachment of the people to their pas-  tor. In the fear that might have arisen in any minds that they might be called to surrender him, either at the call  of another station, or of death, or through discord and  strife, almost the first thought would be," What would our  children do? what a loss it would be to the young of the  parish!" Thus were Deacon Smith and his wife fre- quently heard to express themselves. Whilst the pastor was useful among the young, and his usefulness acknowledged universally in the parish to be  great, he was at the same time felt to be useful to all classes. His church always had food from both his preach- ing and conversation, and those who were not among the followers of the Master he served felt that he was of great service to them in different ways.           I It was the practice of Mr. Eldridge to exert himself in every way he could for the benefit of his entire people.  Whenever he saw that he could do good, he uniformly attempted to test his ability. He thought he beheld in  the oldest son of Dbacon Smith indications of feeling  which were far from being promising. Indeed, he had heard from different sources that his conduct was not (850)   THE DEACON'S SON.       35t only of evil tendency to himself, but to others by whom he was known and with whom he associated. He men- tioned his fears to the parents, and they each acknowl- edged that what the pastor had observed in their child had already caused them immense pain. They entreated their pastor's interposition with their son. He informed them it was his purpose to seek an opportunity for conver- s' ation with him. To this they urged, and thanked him heartily for having previously thought of thus doing. This son was just rising to manhood. Another year would give him his freedom. There were in him the ele- ments of a character which might render him of great ser- vice to the community. No expense had been withheld by his parents in his education. Though he had been opposed to a collegiate course, yet the schools he had attended had I:  given him almost, if not entirely, the accomplishments which would have been his had he graduated at any'of our colleges. All along his parents and friends had strong hopes that he would be a leader in all thait was good in society and be its great-blessing. He had ever been a favorite both with those of his own age and with others, and his fluence was consequently large. It was therefore to be expected that to such a pastor as Mr. El- dridge his early promise should be known and his ripen- ing character be an object of lively interest. A good and watchful pastor always sees the centres of influence, and is deeply anxious that such should be sound and healthful. He is much around such to add to these strength ,and direction. By reason of his vigils he saw in young Smith what greatly distressed him; for he feared for the results of certain developments if not speedily removed, both on himself and on those over whom he had great sway. He therefore nought, and at length found, a suitable opportu- aity for the expression of his fears and the interposition of his counsels Knowing that his subject was of a spirited   352     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. temperament, he proceeded cautiously and warily; and, in his first interview, was encouraged by the frank ac- knowledgments of his young friend that-his course had not been approved by his own mind and conscience, and  his ready promise to amend, to anticipate that his interpo-  sition would not be in vain. The deacon, seeing the pas. tor soon after this interview, met him with tears of joy, ? and warmly thanked him for his fidelity to his son, and  expressed to him a conviction that good had already been - done, and that the child would yet be to him all that he had hoped. The pastor continued to keep his eye out upon the young man, and his ear open to that which was said of him by those who had better opportunities than his own for knowing his downsitting and uprising. From ; both of these sources of knowledge he soon became again disturbed; and it was not long ere he had a second inter- 1 view with the young man. By reason of his former ac-  knowledgment and promise, and because, after both, he  was not improved, the pastor was somewhat discouraged. He manifested this feeling, and young Smith appeared to be troubled by it. Such was his expression, so fair, so sincere, so sensible did he manifest himself that his course, if persisted in, would despoil him of a good name, rob him of all salutary influence, make hi-m a pest in community, and withal cloud the horizon of his affec- tionate parents, and make it all night in the home of his childhood and youth, that Mr. Eldridge allowed himself  again to feel that there yet was strong reason for hope that his young friend would fortify himself against tempta- tion, and. retrace his steps, and be a strong stay for his parents and a useful member of community. With such feelings he parted from him. However, a few weeks-  brought to Mr. Eldridge's :heart greater sorrow on account  of the young man than it had previously experienced, and he once more gained a place by his side for the purpose   THE DEACON'S SON.       353  of another effort to save him. When the pastor affection- ately inquired of his progress in the promised work of reform the young man endeavored to report favorably, and might have succeeded with a less faithful friend in leaving the impression that this reform was advancing rapidly towards the most complete consummation. As Mr. Eldridge inquired about this step and that in his course, of which in his vigilance he had gained knowl- edge, a crimson hue might be seen on the countenance of his friend, significative of confusion and shame, and there might be heard from his lips a strong denial of the allega- tions suggested andan earnest assertion of his innocence. When his assertions were confronted with the testimony of faithful witnesses and there was no power to gainsay or resist them, then the young man, as if in the hands and under the guidance of a power from which all that is evil in our world has arisen, sent forth torrents of wrath and cursing upon the friend by his side for his interference in business which was not his own, and menaced him sorely that such conduct of his would be visited upon him with consequences far from being pleasant and desirable. Why all this change in demeanor, was to Mr. Eldridge, at first, a mystery. He had not been rough with his friend nor unkind. True, he had faithfully depicted to him the end of the way he ias travelling. True, he had detailed many scenes of pain and suffering he would pass through before reaching this end, such as his being abandoned by refined, virtuous, and respectable society, and his identity with vice and profligacy; but his every look, and word, and tone were nothing but love, and denoted nothing but a deep and tender interest in his highest welfare. As he sat hearing peal after peal of abuse and defiance, the pas- tor thought hecould penetrate the mystery which this con- duct at first created by the -supposition that it was his mighty effort to rid himself of reproof, and that he had 354     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. reached the turning point of his career. The subsequent history of the young man proved that the pastor was  correct.  It was some weeks before the pastor met Deacon Smith.  He had designed calling upon him, but had been prevented  by the imperious call of other duties. He wished to sym. pathize with the father and to- condole with him in an  affliction which he had tried faithfully tqavert, but which i had come in despite of all human power to prevent. It was not at the deacon's house where. Mr. Eldridge met him,  but in the street. As he approached him, and whilst ex- tending the warm hand which had ever before met a hand equally warm il congratulations on meeting, Mr. Eldridge i thought he discovered a look about the deacon which was uncommon to him. Unsuspecting that the changed look ;! was the effect of alienated fgeing towards the pastor,-  conscious that his whole cou:Se towards himself and fam-  ily had ever been prompted by the purest friendship and most sacred fidelity, and believing that he had the warm approval and gratitude of the deacon for all that he had  endeavored to accomplish,-Mr. Eldridge had no doubt  that the present strange demeanor of his friend was the product of sorrow from the conduct of his son. Accord- ingly he soon alluded to him, supposing that his feelings : were absorbed in reflections upon him. Instead of relax-  ing under the tender tones of the pastor and the expres- sion of his warmest sympathy, as would, be natural did the strange manner grow out of trouble from 'this source, his bearing grew more stiff and indifferent. Of this the  guileless pastor thought nothing more than that his;, I troubles had a deep effect upon him; and he continued  pouring into the deacon's ear, and, as he supposed, ^his; ' heart likewise, all that rich consolation which the gospe so abundantly administers to the afflicted. Whilst he wa;:s thus engaged the deacon uttered rarely a sentence - and   THE DEACON-S SON.       355   they at length separated, the deacon and pastor going to their respective homes. Upon his arrival at his house Mr. Eldridge entered his sitting room, in which there happened at the time to be no one present, and seated himself in a rocking chair, where he remained some moments in profound meditation. At length his wife came in; and, finding him resting his head on his hand, which was his frequent practice when pensive and thoughtful, she observed,- "O, I did not know that you had returned, husband; what is the matter now?" "I have seen Deacon Smith, and I cannot keep him out of my mind. I fear the conduct of his son will be almost too much for him,' Mr. Eldridge said. "I endeavored to console him; but, poor man! I am afraid he is incon- solable."  "I am very glad," Mrs. Eldridge remarked, "that you have seen him, I have been much tried at the circum- stances which have prevented your calling there before; for I knew that both the deacon and his wife would be very anxious to see you." "Ah, well, I do not think that any thing man can do can be of service to the deacon; poor, disappointed, most afflicted man "Mr. Eldridge continued. "I hardly ever met with an individual whom trouble had so greatly changed. He did not appear like Deacon Smith. If I had not been aware of his-great trial, and were I but slightly acquainted with him, I should have thoughtat thae was very sullen." "That cannot be said of Deacon Smith, husband, that he is s:^/en," Mrs. Eldridge said. His feelings are so acute I that he does not act like himself; and no wonder. Robert is his oldest son; he has made great calculatins upon him:; and to have him conduct as he does is a most severe trial. The deacon has never had any trial before from   856     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. his family. There has been very little sickness in his family, and never a death; and this takes hold upon him most effectually." "Yes, it does, poor manI "Mr. Eldridge said. "I wih  I could do something for him; but I feel that I cannot. I  most sincerely pity him." In this way did the pastor express himself of his poor, afflicted deacon; and whilst this conversation was going  on at the parsonage, let us see the deacon at home. There  was visiting at his house for a few days a lady'Who was  much attached to her pastor, and one who was generally  beloved for her many virtues throughout the parish. She  had long been on very intimate acquaintance at the dea- con's, and was(regarded and treated by all the family rather as one of their own number than as a common friend. When the deacon came home his appearance was as usual. There was the same pleasant smile on his counte- nance and the same readiness at pleasantry which were usual to him. His wife, as was her custom when he re- turned from the village, inquired after the individuals he l had met. In reply to her questions he mentioned over a  number of persons with whom he had had a few words. "Did you see any thing of Mr. Eldridge?"Mrs. Smith asked.  With a sudden change of voice and manner he replied, "I rather think the man thincs he has seen me."    g "Why, husband," said his wife, in painful astonishment, "did not you promise me that you would not talk angrily with Mr. Eldridge when you met him?" "Well," said the deacon, "I have kept my promise. I did not say an angry word to him; but I rather guess I let hiM know that I don't like to have our Robert talked  to as he did the other day."         -- "Why, Mr. Smith! I wonder at you. How could you do i any thing to wound the feelings of such a good and devoted   THE DEACON'S SON.      357 minister as Mr. Eldridge? After what you told me I have rested easy, thinking you would not let Mr. Eldridge know that you felt injured. You know you have not the least cause for feeling hard towards him. You have told Robert time and again, and so have I, the very same things and worse things than Mr. Eldridge did; and I think it is very unreasonable in you to blame him in the least for what he has said. You requested Mr. Eldridge to see Robert, and to exert himself all that he could to save him, and he has been faithful; and, instead of your feeling hard about him, you ought to feel most grateful." "Well, I don't like to have a man tell my son that he is in danger of being a pest in the community, of being shunned by all respectable people," the deacon said, "when there is no call for it. Mr. Eldridge knows that Robert has done much bettesince he-had his first conver- sation with him; and if he had let him alone after that all would have been well, and I should ever have been grateful to him." "We know, husband," said Mrs. Smith, "that our minis- ter is not a rash, but a very prudent man. He never says any thing until he is satisfied his duty calls him to speak. I have no doubt all that he said to Robert was called for. Mr. Eldridge would not have said anything to him unless his'judgment and conscience urged him, I am -persuaded." "You know how Robert feels towards Mr. Eldridge," the deacon said. "He feels that he has abused him, and I think he has good reason for feeling so." "No, you do not, husband; you do not; for you have said to Robert and to me, many times, the very things wh'ih Mr. Eldridge did, and you said more. You did not hink you were abusing the child when you said them, nor did I; nor do I now think that Mr. Eldridge has abused him. How did Mr. Eldridge appear when you saw him to-day?    358     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. f "O, I don7t know. He appeared as usual, I suppose,"  the deacon said. "I felt so, I did not pay much attention  to know how'he appeared."   "I think you are very\ much out of the way, my dear husband, in feeling as you do towards our faithful pastor."   "Perhaps I amn' the deacon said; "but I do not think so. I think Mr. Eldridge has done very wrong, indeed, in saying any thing to make Robert so angry. I am really  afraid what he has said to him will be the means of his ruin. I am not reconciled to such conduct. I never  can be."  "O husband I It grieves me to hear you talk so.'" It was very unfortunate for the deacon that he did not give ear more to his wife and less to his son. The truth was, the son was on the highway to ruin, whilst the blinded eye of the father could not see him as thus exposed. Strong affection, unwillingness to have it so, credulity at the deceptive sayings of the child combined to close the eye of the parent to the real course of his son, and to  make his ear heavy that he could not hear from faithful i  witnesses what this course really was. Had he sought an interview with his pastor, according to the desire of his  wife that he should, and, in the exercise of candor and con- fidence in the fidelity of the man whom he had hitherto almost adored, borne himself wilst this interview lasted, the deacon would have been as wise as his pastor in rela- tion to matters involving the momentous interests of the  child. Had the pastor suspected the possibility of the father's being ignorant of the facts which he discovered thsougillis own affectionate vigilance, had he thought it . possible that his own interest in a parishioner could tran- seend the interest of a parent in the child, of course Mr. # Eldridge could-at once have given the deacon both light and knowledge which might have put new feelings in his     THA DEACONS SOnt.       859 soul, and thereby softened the asperity of manner which the pastor charitably mistook for the effects- of deep sor- row. The best men sometimes err; therefore it must not be proper. Had Deacon Smith only mentioned to his pastor when he met him in the street the state of his feel- ings, Mr. Eldridge in a few words would have disabused him of his prejudice, were he willing to allow facts and evidence their convincing power. But alasa for poor human nature! affection for an erring child had mhade him his helper in vice, and induced him to sympathize with the child in his wrath towards the faithful friend who had endeavored to interpose and save the -one from ruin and the other from the keenest sorrows. However strange it may seem that the confidence in and love -and respect for the pastor which had been strengthening for nearly twenty years should be at once destroyed, and in their place be rancor and prejudice of no common character, yet such was the revolution in the breast of the deacon. His dis- cerning and amiable wife did much to keep the new feelings which had entered her husband's heart in abey- ance; but she was not always with him, nor did the recol- lection of her entreaties always overcome him to silence when abroad. Though for months he did not speak out so that the community became advised of his alienated feel- ing, yet there were thoseiii the parishwho were apprised of its existence. Somehow or other, Colonel Presbury and the deacon grew more intimate. Goods came oftener from Dixon's store than formerly, and numberless little things, in a small, stifled utterance, for a year or two whispered that all was not just right with the deacon. The: astor, however,.knew nothing of the change. When he called at the deacon's, Mrs. Smith, through fear her husband might say or do what would express his real feelings, would be all attention to the pastor; she really lived for  360     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. his real worth; and the deacon had sense enough to  restrain himself so that a discrepancy in feeling between husband and wife would not be manifest. So the pastor never dreamed that an enemy was in ambush before him or that the deacon was changed from what!he had ever  been. This kind-of wary management was as, successful generally in the parish in concealing the real state of the deacon's feelings. Even Colonel Presbury was charged, and solemnly promised to give no publicity to the secret ! unless by permission. Save, therefore, a certain few, the community for much time knew nothing of the true  state of the deacon's feelings. - AI   CHAPTER   XXXII.  A DONATION PARTY. WHLST Mr. Eldridge had so deep a place in the affec- tions of his people as the, preceding chapters must have shown, it would have been singular if hewli ere not often remembered by the families of his parish at those tips when the favor of a propitious Providence had given -them an exuberant supply for their own necessities. He was thus remembered. The farmers did this when their fields contained the articles which are every day needed for the table where the wants of the body are satisfied. The few manufacturers who were here and there in his territory did this; and scarcely a single household inthe parish omitted in the' course of every year to make the pastor or his family some present with which to manifest their affection and esteem, Aside from these informal and private acts of generosity, it had ever been the practice of his people to go en masse once a year to the house of their pastor to tender their kind congratulations, and to leave in his family that which would tell in the wardrobe, or on the table, or in the library. These annual visitations were something more than occasions for allowing the people to have a good time at the parsonage, regardless of the injury to carpets, paint, furniture, which often accompanies indifferent as, semblages for fun an: frolic which haso marked some 31             (361)  362     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. donation visits of which we have heard. The parishioners of Mr. Eldridge never incurred the charge of eating all that they carried, and of leaving nought but the fragments to testify of their respect and love for their pastor. If the disposition thus to do had appeared in:imanyit would have been rebuked baythe ruling spirits, whichwere powerful by their judicious and commendable counsel t have the donation visit always amount to something of substantial benefit to the pastor. It was well known what Squire and Mrs. Davidson, and others like them, considered the proper demeanor on these occasions, and likewise that it would not escape the eyes of MrS. Smith, Mrs. Clay, and others, what was carried to the parsonage, and what re- mained there, too, after-the comply had mostly retired. By reason of these influences there was ever an anxiety and care on the part of every family to have their gift of an appropriate, and therefore of a serviceable, character. In the nineteenth year of his pastorate the people made Mr. Eldridge a donation visit, which was like the others which had preceded it-a gathering of the multitude. Smiling countenances, heavy baskets and boxes, full bar- rels and bags, and large bundles were all there as usual. Till an hour or two had passed after the company was made up it was not discovered but that all the people were there likewise. When, however, the novelty and excite- ment of the scene were over, and it became a matter of comfort for those who were there to sit rather than stand, when the time came for " taking observations," it was dis- covered that several of the people who had heretofore always been prominent on these occasions were absent. Squire Davidson, of course, was not present; for all knew and greatly lamented his failing health. But why Colonel Presbury, Deacon Smith, and one or two- others were absent, was a matter of wonderment to the largest part of the company., Mrs. Smith was there, and it was remarked   A DONATION, PARTY.       363 by some that the wagon in which she rode was unusually freighted with good things for the pastor and his family; but why the hired iman, and not the husband, was her at- tendant, seemed greatly to confuse the many. Although Mrs. Smith had ;ever-ben ,prominent on these occasions, being one of the few harged with the general superintendence, yet at this time :her activity transcended:;its usual boundary. This circumstance was noticed, and made .the subject of remark, in many circles about the house. It was considered that her attachment to her pastor grew more and more strong, because her attentions to him were so many and so marked. It being no place for seeking an explanation of the deacon's absence, when it was generally understood that he was in town and in health, and that he had been seen "up in town" by many just before they came to the parsonage, those who were inquisitive for the cause did not attempt to gratify their curiosity, but became engrossed with the scenes- that were versatile about them. Mrs. Smith,:Mrs. Clay, and Mrs. Howard, being leading characters at this gathering, frequently were in consul- tation in relation to sundry arrangements for the evening. The entire parsonage being thrown open to the people, these ladies felt at liberty to enter any room which might be best suited for their purpose. When need of counsel and especial care had ceased, towards the close of the evening, Mrs. Smith indicated to Mrs. Clay and Mrs. Howard that their company would afford her peculiar pleasure; and, herself leading the way, the three went to- gether to the study of the pastor to co mune one with another, with none to disturb., "This has-been a most trying evening to me," Mrs. Smith remarked.  "It has cost me the greatest effort to restrain my feelings; for I have felt that probably this would-be the last donation visit our dear pastor would ever receive from our people."   g64     A VOICE FzrOM THE PARSONAGE. "What has occurred of late to make you thus con- clude?"Mrs. Clay inquired. Colonel Presbury's forces are not increasing, I hope." "I fear they are," Mrs. Smith replied ; " and--" The sentence was not finished; by reason of the excessive weeping of Mrs. Smith. Soon,-however, she rallied, and continued, "The thought is too much for me. I was going to observe that my husband was as much opposed to Mr. Eldridge: as Colonel Presbury is." The effect of this announcement on Mrs. Clay and Mrs. Howard may be conceived. It overpowered conversation for a moment, and the three sat pensive and sad. At length Mrs. Howard said,- "It cannot he that your husband has become an enemy to our pastor." Mrs. Smith, in explanation, proceeded to state that Colonel Presbury had sent a large number of logs to her husband's mill, of late, to be sawed into boards, and that he had: been there himself frequently to see about them. Consequently her husband and the colonel had been much together. "The conduct of our son," she continued, " is no secret to either of you. Our pastor, like a faithful shepherd, had watched the youth and detected symptoms of his unpromising course. Calling one day at our house, he very tenderly and delicately alluded to the subject. Both Mr. Smith and myself were very grateful to hiin for his sympa- thy, and we each entreated him to endeavor to impress upon Robert the-danger he was in, and try to save: him. He re- plied that he had been seeking a convenient opportunity for a conversation with him; and we both thanked him for his thoughtfulness in our behalf. He soon. had an interview with Robert, and. we thought- the effect of his conversation with him was very salutary, and we were encouraged to hope that a reformation would ensue. The interview with   A DONATION PARTY.       365 Robert was repeated twice or thrice. The last time that Mr. Eldridge conversed with him he was very plain with him and, in consequence of his fidelity, Robert became very much enraged, and came home with a long story to his father, which much affected my husband. Mr. Smith at once :sympathized with the boy, took his part, and se- verely censured Mr. Eldridge. I could not think that our pastor had done wrong, though I could not see then the occasion for -his saying many things which he did. ow- ever, I was disposed to wait, before I blamed Mr. E1- dridge, until I had seen him and heard from his own lips his reasons for his course. My husband would not hear to my suggestions, but gave himself up entirely to sym- pathy with Robert. It was not long before I saw our pastor, and was entirely satisfied that he had pursued the only course which the circumstances of Robert's case pointed out to one who would endeavor to serve him. I never had better evidence of his interest in our family, and certainly never before felt under more obligations to him, both as a pastor and a friend, than I did when he was giving me an account of our Robert's conduct and his ? efforts to save him from utter ruin. I thought I would not hint to him that my husband felt Shimself injured, and I presume he does not now know but that he is as friendly to himn as formerly." /"I should have thought," Mrs. Clay remarked, "that the d acon would have waited with yourself for an interview with Mr. Eldridge before he condemned him." , "He ought to have done so," Mrs. Smith replied; "and I tried hard to induce him to wait, and not blame our pastor as he did in thet presence of Robert. But; my efforts were of no avail, He did not appear to /believe it possible that Mr. Eldridge could have had suficient reasons for talking to our son as he did. He said that he knew Robert was not as bad a  boy Mr. Eldridge had 31*            366     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE I represented. O, I fear that something will be done that  will pain many a heart in our parish and greatly distress our good minister."  "The deacon, then," said Mrs. Howard, "has never manifested to Mr. Eldridge his displeasure?" "No, I presume not," was the reply. "He promised  me," said Mrs. Smith, "that he would not say any thing to Mr. Eldridge or any one else on the subject; and doubtless he is now entirely ignorant that his 'good deacon,' as he calls him, is a bitter enemy." It was remarked above that Deacon Smith was seen by some of the company in the village as they were pro- ceeding to the parsonage. He informed his wife in the afternoon that important business would prevent his accom- panying her to the parsonage in the evening. So after fitting her out, which he did very freely and pleasantly, he took another horse and carriage and proceeded to the place where his important business was to be transacted. This place was at the house of Colonel Presbury. . It had been arranged that a party should there meet--if three or four can be called a party -to deliberate and advise I in relation to an end on which the colonel and the deacon had determined to reach. Whilst, therefore, the great body of the people were joyous in their manifestations of regard to a faithful pastor in the parsonage, and dream-  ing of no threatening danger to the permanency of the tie  which had for years bound them so happily together, Dea- con Smith and Colonel Presbury, with one or two others,  were holding a caucus to concert measures for the de-   struction of this tie and for separating this devoted min- ister from his attached flock! In this way it is that  clouds suddenly gather in a pastor's horizon. The sun goeth down clearly, and before midnight there is a tem- pest. Deacon Smith probably had forgotten how warmly /e had expressed himself in favor of his pastor, and that ,. ','                  ,'   A DONATION PARTY.       367 he had most indignantly rejected the suggestion, pleasantly and jocosely made, that perhaps Colonel Presbury would have him for a coadjutor in the nefarious work of retali- ating on the pastor. The'deacon's party having completed the business for which they met before any began to leave the parsonage, he was at home when his good wife returned. Although she could not be happy, even when thronged by the multi- tude who were variously testifying ardent love for one she so highly valued, yet she remained to be one of the last who left for home. How many, on reaching their own abodes, and when musing on the scenes of the evening, made any attempts to conjecture the reasons which occasioned the absence of Colonel Presbury and Deacon Smith from the parson- age, is not known. Doubtless the subject was agitated in many a household circle, and an attempt made to reach the cause of this remarkable event. What passed at the parsonage and at Mr. Clay's was treasured up.    :  "How happened it, husband," Mrs. Eldridge asked, "that Colonel Presbury and Deacon Smith were not here this evening?" "That is what I have thought-of with much anxiety," Mr. Eldridge replied. "I asked Mrs. Smith why her hus- band was not with us; and I thought she betrayed some trouble as she replied that he was prevented by an en- gagement." "I confess," Mrs. Eldridge continued, "if it was not Deacon Smith, whom we know so well as a veryfirm friend, that I should suspect something was wrong. He has always been at our donation visits and been very active, and it seems very strange that he was away to-night. However, I presume he had some business which came upon him very suddenly, or he would ihave been here." "It seems to me," said Mr. Eldridge, "that, if this had O             . .8   368     A VOICE FROAM THE PARSONAGE. been the reason, he would have sent us a special message to such an effect. From the troubled manner of his wife when I alluded to his absence, I have thought that the deacon might have been here" had he been disposed.7 "O, I cannot think there was any disinclination," Mrs. Eu3dridge replied. "Deaon Smith is not the ma to turn s suddenly. Mrs. Clay told me that the deacon's wagon i never came to a donation party with so valuable a freight as it brought, this evening. If he had been -alienated towards us, that would not have been the cased." "It might have been," said Mr. Eldridge. "Mrs. Smith, you know, does as she pleases, and it may be that she had more put in the wagon for us on account of her -husband's coldness. From what I know of her, I should think that such would be her course in the event of her husband's estrangement from us." "I would pot suffer myself, husband, for a moment, to tihink it probable that good Deacon Smith could ever feel differently towards us from what he has done."  "I cannot tell why itis; but ft seems to me," said Mr. Eldridge, "that peacon Smith was not here to-night be- cause he did not wish to be. I have always considered the deacon to be one of our best friends, it is true, and I know of nothing that I have done which should make  i him otherwise now; but having had a pretty extended knowledge of mankind, and of Ideacons in particular, I  have learned to feel that:deacon will take a sudden tack round against  pastor. I cannot think that Deacon Smith would do this; but it may be that I have been mistaken." "I would not cherish the thought that Deacon Smith had become unfriendly to you," said Mrs. Eldridge. He is the last man to do this. 0nily think how many people, both in and out of our parish, have told us what DeAcon Smith has said in favor of his minister. He has been   A DONATION PARTY.       369 X exalting you, far and near, ever since you have been here, as being the best minister in the state; and it would sound strangely now to hear him talk differently from this. I would not, husband, allow myself to think it possible for such a man as Deacon Smith to turn against me." 4' I know," replied Mr. Eldridge, " that all the past mani- festationsl of the deacon towards me make it very im, probable that he is unfriendly now ; but then, after all, deacons hiave acted as strangely as all this." "Well, husband, Zf Deacon Smith is against you, others will be soon. He has great sway here, you know." "That he has," saidUMr. Eldridge; "I am well aware of this., If the deacon is against me, H may as well think my days here are numbered and will soon -be finished.'" "If you feel that he is unfriendly," said Mrs. Eldridge, "I would call and see him, and know all about it." 'i No, no, my dear wife ;that is not my way. No one but yourself will -ever know that such a thought is in my mind. I shall go on as ever, endeavoring'to do my duty day by day, and shall not, either by word or deed, disclose to any one a fear that Deacon Smith may be opposed:- to me. I have already seen too many sad effects of pastors helping their people dismiss them in doing what you sug- gest. If Deacon Smith is" opposed, he would be relieved should I introduce the subject to him. I have long made up my mind that, if ever there should be trouble in the parish, I would know nothing i4t. My opponents shall never have ahy assistance from my words or actions with which they can the more easily accomplish their work. They shall have all :the labor and all the pleasure." After Mr. and Mrs. Clay arrived home, Mrs.- Clay rehearsed to her husband the conversation of Mrs. Smith. ("Can it be," Mr. Clay said, "that Deacon Smith has left Mr. Eldridge2-- the man he has praised so much, the man   370     A VOICE FROM THE ABRSOONAGE, he has considered almost the personification of perfection, Can it be that Deacon Smith is sudh- a man?" "We must, indeed, now'admit this to be the fact," said Mrs. Clay, "Mrs. Smith being authority. It is sad to think of.'? "Yes, yes," said Mr. Clay; a if Deacon Smith is opposed to Mr, Eldridge, Colonel Presbury will probably know it, and the two will make serious trouble in the parish." "There may be some little- trouble," said Mrs. Clay; "but, then, it will not amount to much. There are enough here, without the colonel and the deacon, who are able and willing to stand, by and support Mr. Eldridge." "These two individuals will carry many with 'them," Mr. Clay :sed. "If they really undertake to dismiss our pas- tort they will succeed, I have no doubt. I never supposed the colonel could do much unless he had some influential nembers of the, church to work with him; and now, if he has the deacon on his side, I should not be surprised if we had a council here within a year for the purpose of dis- missing Mr. Eldridge," "How is it possible for the colonel and deacon to get a majority on, their side,", Mrs. Clay asked, "when now nearly all the people are satisfied with our pastor?" "It is a very easy thing," soid Mr. Clay, "for people to be friendly to a minister when there are no particular influences at work to make them otherwise. There are a great many fair-weather friends in a parish, who are always hid in a storm. The deacon and colonel will make a flurry, and it will not be six months before they will have on their side of the house a majority of voters in a parish meeting. They are now, or will soon be, at work with their minions. The deacon knows how the thing is done, They will do here as is done in other places when the effort is made to dismiss a minister. We shall! have mis-   A DONATION PARTY.       6X representation and lying about the minister, and all that species of conduct, which always succeeds in prejudicing certain minds against him  "I cannot see as your do, husband," said Mrs. Clay. "I do not believe that our-people will ever consent to part with Mr. Eldridge, let the colonel and deacon do what they may." - I hope you are right," Mr. Clay replied; "but, then, I think you will acknowledge your mistake before many months." / -   CHAPTER XXXIII. THE PASTOR'S VISIT TO HS NATIVE TOWN. WITHN a few weeks from the donation visit described in the preceding chapter, Mr. Eldridge was called to his native town on business connected with the settlement of his father's estate. He was thus absent three weeks, being detained ten days beyond the period at which he conten- plated returning when he left home by an unlooked-for concurrence of circumstances which transpired to oppose a more speedy adjustment of the business which it was his object to effect. It was unfortunate for him that his inter- est required him to be away from his parish at this particu- lar time, when the colonel and the deacon were beating up volunteers to a war; for they had a far more favorable opportunity for succeeding in their nefarious object with the pastor out of town than they could have had had he been among his people. Both the colonel and Deacon Smith now acted as if it was their purpose to effect the dismission of the pastor. They did not propose this publicly, nor at first even pri- vately, to those with whom they sought opportunities for conversing on parochial matters; but they so expressed themselves as to start the fear or apprehension that Mr. El- dridge's hold on the affections of his people was giving way, and that perhaps some other minister might better unite the parish, and consequently be moregenerally useful. The dea- (372)   con was a wary man. -e well knew that he had unbounded influence, and it was notiis purpose to do any thing by which this should bi   shhed. He was determined to have another pasto :iVwas no vey easy part for him to act-insidiously toundermine the popularity of Mr. El- dridge without 'the discovery of any that such was his object. Having been long-acquainted with his pastor, he had discovered the weaker elements of his character, as all men, however eminent, have these; but the abounding excellences which the pastor's character contained having v till now veiled these weaker elements, the deacon was not in the habit of thinking of them, and was never known to utter a word by which it could be conveyed that there was any thing about the pastor which was not exactly as it should be. Now, however, the deacon's object required that the6whole character should be exposed; and if this only had been attempted there would have been nothing disclosed that would in theleast have taken a particle of real excellence from the pastor or haiver rejudiced any mind against him. Whilst the deacon undertook to give certain minds which it was his desire to convert to his way of thinking some new light on Mr. Eldridge's public and private character, he went beyond the boundaries which real truth prescribed, and drew to-his aid what lay in the boundless field of imagination, conjecture, and mis- representation. He did not do this directly so that any particular remark of his could be repeated as hostile to Mr. Eldridge; but he did it in his own way, coloring a little here, and making it light a little there, with a dex- terous stroke, so that the -picture would appear after his own desire, and yet he have no particular part in its draw- ing. We all know that this is often done, and that many a character has been thus tarnished when it would be diffi- cult to charge home on the guilty'offender the ways and the means adopted to effect the wicked deed.

In this way he succeeded with some, and without their consciousness, too, that such was his purpose, in alienating warm affections from the current where they had run ten or twenty years, and making it cold towards the pastor, The way would thus be opened for more direct conversa- tion, which would be commenced by others than the dea- con, when it would be conjectured that he, too, was not exactly satisfied with Mr. Eldridge, and that some other minister would better please him; and so the subject of his dismission began to be agitated. Of- course there was a report at head quarters of all conquests and of all circumstances which seemed to favor conquests. It would then be in the way for Colonel Pres- bury or some one else to follow in the wake of the deacon for the purpose of confirming the deacon's converts and assisting others leaning in the desired direction to fall and be in full ranks with the deacon and his company. Strange as it may appear, after this kind of manoeuvring, in the short space of a few weeks many individuals who I had almost wBrshipped their pastor were transformed and made ready to hail another minister. "The deacon of course knows; and, if he thinks so, there must be some foundation ;" and so after the deacon many went, and with him as their guide they felt safe. Before the return of Mr, Eldridge, the small parlor at Colonel Presbury's where the first meeting of the mal- O ntents was held on the evening of the doogtio# visit W s too strait for the weekly conclave, the aumber:had so ms -inereas  It ica,  nessay fe th eoalel to   THE PAsTRB S VISIT TO HS NATIVE TOWN, 4:( open a larger M  a  a o/dade  those who were seek- ing the Igood       -wlf, :elfare of Jerusalem. It was a part of  SIyt    ite none to this meeting until there was g plte: evidence that they were of the right stamp; and it wa s:another part of ;the same policy that none who were present should make it known that these meetings were held, or that any movement was thought of for disturbing the pastoral relation. None, therefore, but the elect were aware that Mr. Eldridge's foundations were being shaken ; and the multitude thought that all things relating to him were as prosperous as ever. So it is that a pastor thinkpth there is no cloud in hiz horizon and the people at large see nothing-but-a bright and cheering firmament, when in reality a terrible storm, menaces and shortly appears, confounding -and distress- ing confiding ones and those who have long been happy under his various ministry. Mr. Eldridge, while lingeringn in his native town to have events transpire for the completion of the business which called him. thither, had a favorable; opportunity to revive former friendships and to know all about the things relating to the church and parish with which his parents were connected, and for which he had ever cherished the most lively interest. He had not been long in the place nor seen but a few individuals before he became impressed that every thing was not as it should be with the:incum- bent of the pastoral office there. When he first began to hear from the lips of parishioners the sad tale of their sorrows and disappointments, he received their recital with distrust; for he was too wise in ecclesiastical con- cerns to be ignorant of the fact that a faithful pastor is- often traduced when there is no just cause on which to found a charge. Indeed, so slightly was he affected by what the heard that he did not for some" time admit the possibility that the sayings of the people could be -true,   A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. and he dismissed them from his mind as the tales of scan. dal or of gross misrepresentation. .However, he thought at last he should know the estimate it would be proper to put on the gossip of the people:when he could have the happiness to arrive at Deacon Babbit's; for towards this venerable man he had from childhood to the meridian of life had the greatest respect and affection. When Mr. Eldridge was a boy the name of Deacon Babbit ever drew forth homage and love from all the people; and the years that had passed since only increased the affection and confidence of every one towards him. He was a candid, guileless, and godly man; a man who honored and re- spected the ministry, and one who ever stood up with a square shoulder for the pastors who had been settled over the people with whom he was connected. Not only for his own ministers was he a support, but for all. He appre- ciated their situation. He knew its difficult and perplexing character; and from principle, as well as from feeling, he as the ready advocate of the minister. By reason of his influence and example many were induced to tread softly by the pastor's door and to make it as pleasant and as happy for him as possible. Could they who have been his ministers know the source whence many a benefaction came to their abode, could they know why it was that gossip about the minister and his family was of such a slender voice, and even that so unfrequently raised, then would they know more of the value of Deacon Babbit. If all the good things which his pastors received did not come directly from the house of this good man, it must be confessed the greater part of them would never have been carried to the parsonage had it not been for the sentiments it was ever his practice to instil into the people. Deacon Bab- bit was not thus impelled in his course towards ministers because he thought they were perfect men and unable to do wrong. He did not thus think. He had too much   II (c i i;   THE ,PAST9' VIST TQ H:S NATIVE TOWN.  3" good ,seisethuQ g , tNi?] TDegaon Babbit tabught miniis ters ic4d 4o right, and ith t, as a geeral thing, they were full as consistent asother men;; and therefore hewas their friend and supporter. He was, moreover, urged forward to throw around them his shield and to make their way pleasant, because he considered they were engaged in a most noble work and had to struggle against peculiar ob- stacles and trials. On this account he conceived that ministers were entitled to the support and sympathy of the people, and especially of those who were the professed disciples of the great Master of the minister. Because these were the sentiments of Deacon Babbit, and because they commended themselves to the conscience and intelli- gence of every man, he had great influence over the com- munity in the treatment of ministers. Knowing all this, it is not strange that Mr. Eldridge thought it would be safe for him to form a judgment of the rumors that had reached him respecting the present pastor after he should have seen Deacon Babbit and heard from him the situation of parochial affairs. In due time Mr. Eldridge paid the venerable deacon a visit. Though living nearly ten years beyond the ap- pointed age of man, yet it was not manifest that the inner man was old and enfeebled. On the contrary, all there appeared sprightly and in vigor, It was cheering in the extreme to Mr. Eldridge to find his aged friend thus; and it was a greater source of joy to him still to find him the same man that he had ever been, with the exception of the improvements accorded to him by grace and wisdom. At a suitable period in his interview with the deacon Mr. Eldridge alluded to some of the rumors which be had heard since his arrival in town touching the minister of the place. "Ah," the deacon said, "then they have been filling your ear respecting our parish matters I am sorry 32 * A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE.             Ti the people here are so imprudent as to talk so much about our minister. It is something new for them thus to do. I have thought our people were rather different in this respect from many parishes; but I am fearful they are losing their characteristic prudence. Some of the young people here have acquired a deep prejudice towards the minister, and they are not inclined to govern their feel- ings or their tongues as they should. They are to blame, I think, as well as the man against whom they talk so severely." "I am pleased to hear you say this," Mr. Eldridge re- marked. "I thought, from my slight acquaintance with Mr. Becket, that he was a good man and was inclined to do good." "Yes; I believe our pastor to be a good man," the deacon said, "and I think he wishes to do good; but, then, the young people and others have some cause for being dissatisfied, I really think. But they have no excuse for talking about Mr. Becket as they do. They say many things which are utterly false." "Well, deacon," Mr. Eldridge observed, "I have be- come somewhat interested since I have been here in your parish matters, and I should like to hear from you your opinion of Mr. Becket's course. I have not paid much at- tention to what has been told me; for I have seen that the people have been much excited, and I knew that all could not be true that I have heard." "No, no," the deacon said ; "not half of it is true, I dare say. As I said before, I believe our minister is a good man; but he is not a man of very enlarged views, I think. A very great cause of the trouble here has arisen from Mr. Becket's unwillingness to leave his old, beaten track. He thinks, I should judge from his conduct, that all the benefit which the people need his two services on the Sabbath are fitted to impart. Well, I have no doubt  that the people might be much more benefited than they have been if they had made it their business to derive all the good in their power from Mr. Becket's preaching. But I really think he has been unwise in not having meetings in the week time and in not giving the younger brethren an opportunity to exercise their gifts. That is what they want. They desire a meeting Sabbath evening, and they want one or two meetings durihg the week; and I think it would be well to gratify them." "Certainly," said Mr. Eldridge; "I think so; decided- ly; and I am astonished that Mr. Becket does not think so too. What reason can he give for not having such meetings?" "All that I ever heard of his giving was, he was afraid of excitement. He did not wish to have the people be- come excited. Now, I think it would have been much better for the pastor, and people, too, to have had the ex- citement occasioned by-frequent religious meetings than the excitement which now exists." "There can be no doubt of that," Mr. Eldridgg said. "The excitement which appea's now I should take to be a very destructive feeling if i were your minister. I could not reasonably hope to be instrumental of much good whilst it continued." "It is very strange that Mr. Becket did not see it," the deacon remarked. "He might have been the means of allowing much good to be done had he encouraged the young men and others who were for making efforts for the: good of souls, and appointed meetings, so that they could have taken a part in the services. I have wondered how he could conscientiously refuse to have these meetings when he saw how strong the desirewas for them. I should have thought he would have been very much pleased and encouraged by the feeling that called for them, and have done every thing in his power to make them interesting and profitable."    A VOICE FROM THi PARSONAGE.             THR "' Has he never had more than two services on the Sab. bath?"Mr. Eldridge inquired. "Has he never had any Sabbath evening meetings or conference meetings during the week?" "Yes, sir; sometimes, after he had been beset by the people to appoint more meetings, he would have a confer. ence meeting Sabbath evening; but he would, in his zeal to prevent excitement, endeavor to do away the effect of the exhortations of the brethren; and this only made the matter worse. Because he has manifested opposition to what the brethren have said at these meetings they have been much displeased." "I suppose I must consider all this true of Mr. Becket," Mr. Eldridge remarked, "because you are the witness, deacon. Had I heard the same elsewhere I should have been disposed to question the statement somewhat." "I am much obliged to you," the deacon replied, "for your confidence. I never intended to slander any one, and especially a minister. I regret exceedingly that the truth requires as much as this to be said of our pastor. Had he been more ready to have had extra meetings, and treated the brethren whose pious feelings led them to ask for such with more kindness, I think the cause of religion would have prospered more here than it has." "Undoubtedly," Mr. Eldridge replied.  '"Has Mr. Becket treated with unkindness the brethren who were anxious that greater efforts should be made for the ad- vancement of piety here?" "I fear he has," the deacon said. "Several of the brethren have repeatedly told me that he treated them with great coldness, and at some times with great harkhness. From the manner in which I have heard Mr. Becket speak of these brethren, I have no doubt they have reason for saying what they do. I cannot think it is right for a min- ister to conduct in this way. It is wrong to offend any      THE PASTOR'S VISIT TO HS NATIVt t1OWN. X man, and particularly to offend those individuals who are much engaged in the cause of religion, for no other reason than that they are thus enigaged and desire to have all feel as they do. And then, again, it is wrong for a minister to neglect to have meetings when they are really called for by the people. It is discouraging to pious feeling, and it is hindering the advancement of true piety." "That is very manifest," Mr. Eldridge said; " and I am much astonished that Mr. Becket has not seen all this himself." "So am I," the deacon said. "I have often wondered how the man could be easy to' see things going as they have been here for several years past. We have had no revivals, and but a very few have been added to the church. The congregation on the- Sabbath has been dwindling away; and, if there is not an alteration soon, I see no rea- son why the church here will not become extinct and there be no interest in religion whatever. Already several fami- lies have left the society and go to another parish to meet- ing because of the position of Mr. Becket in relation to progress; and I am afraid others will do the same unless Mr. Becket either alters or goes away." "Why can he be so unwise," Mr. Eldridge inquired, "'as to do as he does? Why will he place obstacles in the way of revivals of religion and of the general progress of the church and parish?" "Sometimes I have thought our brother Addison told the truth when he said, 'Mr. Becket does not wish for a revival here, because he would then have more labor to perform. His laziness is in the way.' That: is a hard speech; but there is some truth in the remark. I think Mr. Becket is rather an indolent man ; but I never say so here." "He cannot expect to remain here long if he is aware the people feel towards him as you represent," Mr. EI- dridge said.   A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE.               TH "He has been told how people feel towards him; and I should think, if he had not been, he would think, from the empty pews, that there was not much interest in him among the people," the deacon said. "What does he say for himself when he is informed that there is a desire that he should leave?" "I am informed," the deacon replied, "that he does not make any conversation whatever with those who have in- formed himp of the state of feeling here." "How long since the first intimation was given him of this state of feeling?" "Between three and four years," the deacon said. "I am told by some of the brethren that they have had conversa- tion with him on the subject very often, as often as they dare to, and that it amounts to nothing at all." "Does he never converse with you on the subject?" "No, sir," the deacon said. "He never alluded to any dissatisfaction of the pepple with him in any of my inter- views with him; and, as I knew he was informed of the matter, I have thought that I would not mention the sub- ject to him. Deacons are apt to run before they are sent in these matters of difficulty; and I thought I would be still. I never yet quarrelled with a minister; and I am now too old to begin." "You appear to have some knowledge of individuals who hold the same office in the church with yourself, I should judge by this last remark," Mr. Eldridge said. "What do you refer to, sir?--my saying that deacons were apt to run to the minister who has difficulty in his parish and inform him that it is time for him to ask for a dismission before they are sent?" "That is the remark," Mr. Eldridge said. "That is true," the deacon said. "I have known of a number of instances of ministers being dismissed wholly for such a reason. People, when excited, saip hard things   THE PASTOR'S VISIT TO HS NATIVE TOWN.   383   of their minister, and the deacons got wind of their say- ings, and forthwith reported them to the pastor. Then the pastor would treat these individuals with coldness and consider them enemies; and in this way alienation would be fomented, and the end would be dismission." "I see you understand it," Mr. Eldridge said. "Dea- cons are not all alike ; but, then, I have no doubt they often make matters worse by their interference."  "Yes, yes; that they do. I do not think a deacon ought to be more prominent in a parish difficulty with a minister than any other man. For my part, I never would be a cat's pawfor others." "That is a very significant expression, deacon," Mr. El- dridge said. "It expresses the idea exactly. People sometimes wish to make a difficulty with their minister; they are ashamed to stir in the matter themselves, and so they go to a deacon and get him to go forward; and then they stand back and coolly look on, and it may be exult over the folly of their instrument." "Yes, Mr. Eldridge, it is often just so; and I have often wondered that deacons would be made tools of for'such infamous purposes."     CHAPTER XXXIV. THE PASTOR'S HORSE. ALTHOUGH Mr. Eldridge had a salary equal to any other clergyman in a country town, - although' his people had from time to time in the course of every year of his pas, torate made him generous presents, yet the aggregate of his receipts by no means relieved; him from the necessi- ty of rigid economy. He was one of those individuals who felt it to be a sacred duty to have an eye out for the future. It was his practice to lay by something every year which could be called to his aid in the event that he should be laid by from his professional labors by sickness or by age. Then, again, he had a rising family; and he felt bound to care well for his children and give them all a thorough education. In doing this he was at no small expense. Two of his sons had already received a collegi- ate education, and his daughters had been absent for years in attendance upon school. So, for the payment of the bills- accruing from these sources, it is apparent no small sum would be required. Then, again, there were the calls upon him by the benevolent organizations of the age, which it was a pleasure and a privilege to him to heed. His library, too, from year to year made drafts upon him which he could not on any account dishonor. His health required of him that he should at times relax his severe pursuits and seek its renewal in travel ;:and here (384)   THE PASTOR'S HORSE.   385   was no small outlet for his money. In addition to all these expenes mnst be mentioned those which arose from the feeding and clothing of his family and in the entertain- ment of company, with which, in no small share, he was blessed. The manner in which Mr. Eldridge met these various expenses had all along been to his people a source of pride and pleasure, and various were the remarks in approval of his course from every part of his parish which were treasured up in his memory. He was always ap- plauded by the manyand never loudly condemned by the few, for his economy; and this trait of his character was almost universally regarded as one of great value.  It is to be remembered that parishioners are not under bonds to continue their approval of excellence in their pas- tor. There is . right reserved suddenly to change and to condemn as strongly as it was ever their practice to ap- plaud. If individuals, therefore had for years lauded tile pastor for his economy, it is no marvel if they turn right about and condemn the man for his meanness and con- tractedness. "It is all fair in politics;" and it is no less so ih ministerial matters when the object is to displace a faithful pastor to gratify the caprice or the will of a fac- tious few, who are determined on revenge, or who have taken it upon themselves to secure another minister more to their own particular taste. A minister cannot be dismissed without cause; that is a settled matter. If a people should be guilty of such an act, they would receive the unmeasured condemnation of the whole community. A minister cannot be dismissed without the people are dissatisfied with him, unless he chooses to go away; then if a few wish to displace him they must have some cause-they must show dissatisfaction. If there be none to exhibit, some must be manufactured for the purpose. This very business Deacon Smith aind Colo- nel Presbury are now doing. They have been at work  A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE., hard at it for several weeks, as the reader has been apprised in preceding chapters. They are turning their pastor over and over. They are going back to his ordi- nation, and are carefully looking over every succeeding year in search of something out of which to manufacture material. Contemptible business, the reader thinks. No doubt of that; but it is a fact, notwithstanding; and if the business was confined-to Mr. Eldridge's parish, perhaps it would not be well to expose it. Charity might suppose it would be repented of there, and fruits worthy of repent- ance be exhibited. However, this business is not thus re- stricted. It has for many years been extensively carried on; and the fruits thereof are many, as the community are well aware. "I really wish our minister would get him a new horse, said Colonel Presbury, as he was conversing in the street with Mr. Bangs whilst Mr. Eldridge rode by. "Why, what is the matter with the one he now has?" Mr. Bangs inquired. "O, I think that horse is a disgrace to the parish," the colonel replied ; "and I have heard others say the same." "I don't know about that," Mr. Bangs said. "I don't see but that the animal looks as well as he ever did. Mr. Eldridge has had him ten or twelve years, I believe; and I never heard any one say any thing against him before." "Well, I have," the colonel said; "and there are many who feel that Mr. Eldridge does not do right to drive such a horse when his salary and presents enable him to keep a better one." "Mr. Eldridge's horse is a better looking animal than half the horses about town," Mr. Bangs said; " and he is a good, faithful old creature. If I was in Mr. Eldridge's place I would not part with him. Mr. Eldridge has ways enough for his money without, buying every new horse that comes along. For my part, I ami glad he makes his    THE PASTOR'S HORSE.       387 horses last so long; and I hope the one he has now will stand him these five years yet." "Don't you think, Mr. Bangs, a minister ought to con sult the feelings of his parish, and not disgrace them abroad by appearing as though he wasn't half supported?" "Why, yes; if a minister has a good salary he ought to appear respectably, I think. Does not Mr. Eldridge ap. pear well enough, I should like to know?" I do not know but the man appears well enough; but I really think people out of town must think from the looks of his horse that we don't do well by him." "If people out of town think so, I should suppose I should have heard something about it before. I am in neighboring towns pretty often, and I often hear Mr. El. dridge spoken of, and well spoken of too. I never heard a word said about his horse. I think his horse is good enough for him or for any one else. Mr. Eldridge can- not afford to be fanciful about a horse-or any thing else. He has a large family and an expensive one; and I think he must find. it difficult to do as he does with no more in- come than he has from our people. You must know, colo- nel, eight or ten hundred dollars don't go far in support- ing many families here who have not half the number of necessary calls for money that our minister has. There's our doctor, with but two children; he says he cannot get along without spending fifteen hundred dollars a year. I don't think he or his family appear any better than our minister and his family. As for the doctor's horses, nei- ther of them is so good an animal as Mr. Eldridge's." "O, well," the colonel said, " the doctor is not supported by the parish, and he can do as he pleases. No one has any right to interfere with his matters." I don't know," Mr. Bangs said, "as any one has- any right to interfere with our minister's matters. If any one earns his money by hard work, I think Mr. Eldridge does.    888     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. For my part, I think he ought to be better paid than he is, and that no one ought to find fault with him for not having a more expensive horse, or for any thing else. I wonder how he can make his salary go as far as he does." After a -few other remarks Mr. Bangs and the colonel parted, and whilst walking along Mr. Bangs met Mr. Cummings, when the latter gentleman immediately said,- "Mr. Bangs, have you been called on to give any thing towards getting a new horse for our minister?" U"No; I have not. Are they going to give Mr. Eldridge a new horse? I have not heard any thing about it. If he wants a new horse, I am ready to do my part to give him lone ; but I think his present horse is able enough yet to do all his-business." "I never heard any thing about-it before this morning,' Mr. Cummings said  "I just met Deacon Smith, and he said some of the people thought Mr. Eldridge had driven his hoprse long enough, and that!he had been a disgrace to the parish ; and they were for subscribing to procure for him oene which would be a respectable-looking animal." "It seems to me," Mr. Bangs ;said-," some people must have opened their eyes all at once. I have just been conversing with Colonel Presbury, who has been running out at great length about the minister's horse. He seemed to be vexed that Mr. Eldridge had no more regard for the reputation of the parish- than to drive such a horse. Now, it seems Deacon Smith thinks the same. I slomuld really like to lnowi what all this means. I have never heard any thing said before this morning that the ,inister's horse was not well enough. He certainly looks a; well as he ever- did.', "I don't know what it means, I confess," Mr. Cummings said. "I did not have any conversation with the deacon about the matter. I was in much haste, and did not stop to hear him talk two moments. I thought, however, he had a queer kind of a look with him when he asked me to   THE PASTOR'^ HORSE.       389 subscribe; and now, from what you tell me, I guess he was not in earnest about getting upa subscription. He must have been joking." "It strikes me as a very singular circumstance,". Mr. Bangs said, "that Colonel Presbury should talk as he did to me about the minister's horse, and that Deacon Smith should begin with you on the same subject. I don't understand it. If I did not know thatC Deacon Smith was very friendly to our minister, I should mistrust that there was some under current at work not of a very promising character." "O, there can be nothing of that kind," Mr. Cummings said. '"The deacon would not do any thing to prejudice people against our minister. You know how well he likes Mr. Eldridge." Here the conversation was interrupted by a gentleman riding up to converse with Mr. Cummings. Mr. Bangs immediately left and proceeded homeward. In a day or two from this -period Mrs. Stimson and   a Miss Bemis called together upon Mrs. Bangs for the pur- pose of soliciting her subscription for the benefit of Mrs. Eldridge. Mrs. Stimson remarked that there had been much said among- the people about the appearance of the minister and his wife; that it was a matter of mortifica- tion to many that Mr. Eldridge drove such a poor horse, and that his wife had worn the same old bonnet and shawl for eight or ten winters. Many individuals have thought that the salary which was paid the minister was amply sufficient to enable him to appear respectably, and that, as he was disposed. to save his money and suffer himself and wife to go looking any how,Ait was time he had a hint that the people were not very well satisfied with such policy. The gentlemen, she said, were going to give him a new horse, and the ladies thought of presenting Mrs. Eldridge with a new shawl and bonnet. 3o -   390     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "Dear me!" Mrs. Bangs remarked. "I am perfectly as- tonished. For my part, I did not know but that Mrs. ElI dridge had a new bonnet every winter; and it was no longer ago than yesterday that I told my daughter, as I saw Mrs. Eldridge passing in the street, that I did not perceive that her shawl had faded in the least. It looked as well as ever. Now, I have no objection to making Mrs. El- dridge a present,-I should be happy in contributing for such an object, -but I cannot consent to give at this time for th6 purpose of mortifying my valued friend." "We thought," Miss Bemis observed, "that almost evbery lady in the parish would be ready to do any thing to promote the respectability of the town. For my part, I think the people have reason to be displeased at the neg- ligence manifested by the pastor and wife to their personal i appearance."  "How long have the people. been thus sensitive in relation to this matter?"Mrs. Bangs inquired. "It cannot be a great , while. For my part, I never heard a single word on the subject before. If there had been any discontent at the bonnet and shawl of Mrs. Eldridge, or at the appearance of Mr. Eldridge's horse, it seems strange that I never heard of it before."  "Well, there is much dissatisfaction in respect to this matter, I assure you," Mrs. Stimson remarked. "I find the ladies willing to contribute for this object; and I have no : doubt Mrs. Eldridge will have a new bonnet and shawl if you do not subscribe." "I am sorry," Miss Bemis said, " that Mrs. Bangs is will- ing to have her minister's wife new trim her bonnet every winter, just to save the expense of purchasing a new one. I think it is disgraceful for her to do this." ' "I do not see," Mrs. Bangs remarked, with much feeling, "that Mrs. Eldridge needs any hints from us to make her more particular about her dress. There is no lady in town                  .1^   THE PASTOR'S HORSE.       391 who dresses more becomingly, or who appears more neatly, than Mrs. Eldridge. If she is disposed to take good care of her things she is to be commended, and I have often heard her commended for her good taste and for her economy." Here the conversation ended by the entrance of Mrs. Clay, who had called upon Mrs. Bangs; and both Miss Bemis and Mrs. Stimson withdrew. As soon as Mrs. Bangs and Mrs. Clay were alone, the former related the conversation of the two ladies who had just left; when Mrs. Clay remarked, under the influence of the most painful feelings,- "You are not aware, Mrs. Bangs, what all this means. I have never till now heard any thing about the shawl and bonnet; but I have about Mr. Eldridge's horse. It is all the same thing, I have no doubt, from the character of Mrs. Stimson and Miss Bemis. , The fact is, Mrs. Bangs, there is an effort making by a few to create a prejudice against our dear pastor and have him dismissed."'  "How you talk, Mrs. Clayl"Mrs, Bangs said. "It cannot be 1 it cannot be - " "I have known of this for some little time past,"' Mrs. Clay remarked, " and I have no doubt that we are to have serious trouble here."          -/ Mrs. Clay then rehearsed the conversation she had with the wife of Deacon Smith at the last donation party. She remarked, too, that her husband had lately heard what Colonel Presbury and Deacon Smith were endeavoring to do in relation to procuring a new horse for the pastor, and then said,-  - "All this is being done to create dissatisfaction with Mr. Eldridge. Every one knows," she said, " that Mr. Eldridge dresses neatly and appropriately, and that Mr. Eldridge's oarse is as good now as -he ever was-- that he looks as well as ever. There is no more reason for making a hue   92     A VOiCE FROM THE PARSONAGE.        : nid cry cnio about these things than there was ten yeas tgd; and there would not be any thing said about them but fo tfik wicked feelings and cruel purpose of Colonel Presbnry and Deadon Smith.

He has no reason for his conduct. Mr. Eldridge had done nothing bat his duty, and she felt very grateful to him for his fidelity to her son." "This seems but a dream," Mis. Bangs observed.. "It cannot be a reality." "It is distressing to think of," Mrs. Clay said ; "but it is a reality.. They are now at work to separate us from our beloved and faithful pastor. Colonel Prosbuiry, Dea- con Smith, Mr. Dixon, Mr. Otis, Miss Bminis, Mrs. Stimson, and a number of others are doing all that they ean to alienate the people from Mr. Eldridge. They don't care a fig about Mr. Eldridge's horse or about Mrs. Eldridge's bonnet and shawl. ,They seize upon these for a pretext to Call round on the people and to converse about the pas- tor -to misrepriesent and defame him." "They cannot succeed," Mrs. Bangs said, "surely they cannot succeed, in turning the hearts of this people from Mr, Eldridge."' "I thought so at first," Mrs. Clay remarked; "but now I am really fearful we shall have to part with our pastor. Deacon Smith has great influence, and  so has Colonel Presbury."   THE PASTOl'US HUlSEl.     ovo "Well, they Will bothf lose t/eir influence when it comes to be known whIy they became dissatisfied with Mr. Eldridge," Mrs. Bangs remarked. "They ought to lose it," Mrs. Clay said. "Men who will act from such motives as now govern the deacon and colonel ought not to have any influence in society, I think.' "Do you think," Mrs. Bangs asked, " that Mr. Eldridge knows any thing about these things?" "I am afraid not," Mrs. Clay said. "Who would wish to communicate them to him? He ought to be apprised of the movement which is now being made. My husband has thought of informing him; but, then, he says he cannot summon the resolution necessary for so painful a duty. Deacon Smith and Colonel Presbury are very shy in their movements, and I presume they do not intend to have the matter made public till all things are right for their object." "It will not be possible to keep this movement from Mr. Eldridge," Mrs. Bangs said. "What friend of our dear pastor would wish to divulge the matter to him? Would you?" "O, I could not," Mrs. Bangs said. "Neither could I," Mrs. Clay observed. "He must know it some time : but I presume he will not be informed of it till Colonel Presbury or Deacon Smith do it them- selves." "This is a most melancholy affair, truly," Mrs. Bangs said. "' To have a minister who has been as devoted as Mr. Eldridge has been turned off merely because of his fidelity is really distressing.; but I cannot believe he will leave." "I hope he will not, surely," Mrs. Clay said, as she rose to leave; ( but we must prepare ourselves for the worst."   , - f  i'i CHAPTER XXXV I THE LOAD OF WOOD. Tine wife of an eminent clergyman in the western part of Massachusetts, an amiable and lovely woman, whose  name we would give but for a promise of secrecy, once said to a friend younger than herself, who was likewise the companion of a minister, - "You know some people think they may give almost  any thing to a minister and it will pass for a present. I have frequently had things given to me which I Would not, on any account, have given to the poorest person of my acquaintance for whom I had the least possible regard." ;' Any one at all conversant with pastoral life, doubtless, can attest to the truth of the above remark. Whilst it does not apply to the majority of parishioners, who, when they give any thing to a pastor, are very careful to have their present of value, yet it does with great propriety de- i scribe the manner in which a few often remember their  minister. It is considered fashionable to give to a pastor,  and it is well that it is so; for the salary of a eletgyman  is seldom larger than to meet the necessities of a family graduated on the most economical scale. By reason of such graduation there are some in every parish who think Lhat the circumstances of their minister are such that al-  nost gny article of clothing or species of food would not  It some time come amiss. In the gift of such, some (394)    THE LOAD OF WOOD.       89, parishioners feel that they are really contributing to the comfort of their pastor's family; though what they give would, but for such destination, be cast out and trodden under foot. In their purchases of their parishioners it not unfre- quently occurs that ministers are subjected to the most fraudulent impositions. This is not true of all their pur- chases; for there, be many in almost every parish who pre- fer when they sell to their pastor to bring forward the most excellent of their material, and even then to make a liberal abatement on the price. But there are others who take a different view of the situation of the minister and of their own favored opportunity to drive a good bargain when he happens to call to make a purchase. They can comprehend the delicacy of the pastor's feelings. They can understand the danger always attendant on a pastor's finding fault either with quality or measure. They often think, too, that the minister is not a judge, and will not notice, and so, feeling that the staff is alogether in their own hands, they can do as they please, and that will be the last of it.  Mr. Eldridge had some such parishioners as the above last described. He and his wife doubtless remembered them long ; for their gross and fraudulent impositions were often the subject of their conversation when they were where they were sure no one could overhear their excla- mations over the wrongs which had been done them. "One of these individuals we must bring out; for his overreach- ing propensities were so great as to induce Mr. Eldridge, under the advice and urgency of friends, to deviate from his established policy and demur to their righteousness  and his duty to patient submission. This - individual had never before the present year trafficked much in the neigh- borhood where Mr. Eldridge lived. The produce of his farm he had been accustomed to carry to a manufacturing   396     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. village at but a little greater distance from his house than was the residence of his pastor. He had not been much known as a trader, though he was considered a respecta- ble man and a man of influence. Having cut off a large quantity of wood, and consequently wishing to dispose of the same, and the manufacturing village before alluded to being now a dull market in consequence of the embar- rassments of trade, Mr. Conner sought a market for his  wood in "the centre," and he succeeded in disposing of a large quantity. Mr. Eldridge had noticed his wood in different door yards, and, being pleased with its quality, thought it might be wel-for him to look to Mr. Conner for his supply. Accordingly he did so, and stipulated for ; the number of cords, quality, and the price, the same as others paid. Soon the wood began to appear ; and as the I first few cords were thrownt off it appeared as well as any Mr. Conner had brought to the centre. Mr. Eldridge was well pleased with it and manifested his satisfaction. Soon, however, Mr. Eldridge noticed that the quality of the wood began to depreciate. More small sticks and crooked ones, too, began to appear; and, as the last cords were being thrown off, the difference was so perceptible as to excite from the youngest son of the pastor, a child of eight years, the inquiry of his father why he did not  have all .his wood alike. When Mr. Conner came with the last load, Squire Davidson and his son. Charles were in the parsonage. It being a pleasant day, the squire thought it might be for his health and comfort to ride a little distance; and so he made it in his way to call- on his pastor. After Mr. Conner had gone Mr. Eldridge and his friends walked out into the garden, and in returning to the house they came up by the wood. "You have two kinds of wood, I see," Mr. Charles Da- yidson observed. "I suppose you consider it economical to buy some small wood, as it comes at half price."   THE LOAD OF WOOD.       397 "No," Mr. Eldridge replied, "I do not. All the wood I have had of- Mr. Conner has been of one price." "Well," said Mr. Davidson, " you do not mean to say that you give the full price for large and small wood?" "Certainly I do," Mr. Eldridge replied. "How much do you give for your wood?" the squire asked. "I agreed to pay five dollars the cord." "You do not expect to give five dollars for that cord Mr. Conner has just left, do you?" the squire asked. "Of course I do," Mr. Eldridge replied; " though I do not think I ought to give it. My wife has been telling me now for a number of days, when Mr. Conner has been throwing of so much little and crooked wood, that I ought to speak to him about it and let him know that I notice it; but I have not, neither do I think I shall. It would probably displease Mr. Conner." "Well," said both the squire and his son, "you ought not to pay full price for this wood. Not' more than half, if there be half, is merchantable wood; and you owe it to yourself and family to see to it that you do not pay for the trashy stuff the same that you would have to pay for first-rate wood. Five dollars a cord is the top price; and wood ought to be first rate to bring this sum." Mrs. Eldridge overheard this remark at her window where she was sitting, and soon she came out into the yard; and let it be known that she was aware of the subject upon which the gentlemen were conversing, and that she was happy to find that the squire and- his son so well agreed with her in opinion as to Mr. Eldridge's duty. "Should I now say to Mr. Conner," Mr. Eldridge observed, " that I thought he ought not to exact:of me full price for this wood, I have no doubt he would feel himself injured. It willnot do for a minister to find fazUt with his people." 34   898     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. Both the squire and his son urged Mr. Eldridge, when Mr. Conner called for his pay, as he would the next day, to object to paying five dollars per cord for all that wood. They said so much, and were fortified so entirely by the eloquence of the good wife i:n- the matter, that the pastor finally passed Mhis word that he would deviate from the course he had practised hitherto, and stand out. The next day, as was expected, Mr. Conner called and presented his bill for twelve cords of wood, at five dollars the cord. Mr. Eldridge took the paper and held it some time before he made any remark. - At length he said, - "I have supposed, Mr. Conner, that five dollars for all this lot of wood was more than a fair price." "You agreed to give five dollars a cord; and I suppose there is nothing more to be said upon the subject," Mr. Conner replied. "Yes, sir; I agreed to give that price, I acknowledge; but, then, I expected that you would bring me wood which is worth that price," Mr. Eldridge saidi "WelD Mr. Eldridge, you can pay me for the wood as you agreed or not, as you please," Mr. Conner said, taking up his hat and preparing to go out. "I do not think it to be my duty to pay five dollars per cord for the entire lot,' Mr. Eldridge said. "The first four or five cords you left was very good wood; but the last loads, seven or eight of them, have been a very differ- ent article. I think you maust have noticed a difference yourself, Mr. Conner." "I understand you to say, sir, that you will not pay me for the wood what you agreed to pay," Mr. Conner said. "Yes, sir, i thiink I shall not pay you to-day sixty dol- lars for that lot of wood." "Upon this dedlatation Mr. Conner took!his hat and very abruptly Oent from the house of Mr. Sldridge under the influence of the highest excitement.   THE LOAD OF WOOD.       399S Mrs. Eldridge, hearing- the outer door violently close, hastened from her apartment to ascertain the cause,. As she reached the door and opened it she saw Mr. Conner at a little distance from the house, walking with the greatest swiftness'. She then entered the room where her husband was sitting and remarked at once, - "Mr. Conner has gone, then; and I should think, from the way he walks, he is in great haste." "He moved out here just now, with -some velocity, I thought, and shut the outer door with some force too," Mr. Eldridge observed, "Mr. Conner is very much excited; and I am sorry almost that I manifested any dissatisfac- tion with the wood, He -is very much displeased, and doubtless will be an enemy to me." "I think, my dear, it would have been decidedly wrong in you to have paid that man as much for the wood he left here as you would have to pay for good wood. I don't think you know how miserable some of it is. I have been try- ing this morning to make a fire, and the wood is so" soggy that I have had much difficulty, I should think it must have lain in Mr. Conner's swamp these five years.' I don't  believe half of this lot of wood has been cut within a year, as you said Mr. Conner told you it had been." "I should'not be at all surprised," Mr. Eldridge re- marked, "if he had picked up the last loadsl he brought here in different places on hisfarm. I noticed that much of it looked like old wood that:hiad been cut some time." "Well, I hope, husband, you never will pay hiln any more than the wood is worth. I think you have been- imposed upon as much as you, ought to have been; 'and undoubt- edly every one knows that you take any thing people have a mind to bring you, and pay just what they ask, without saying a word. I presume Mr. Conner thought you would not notice that the wood was not what it should have been, and that he could get a good round price out of- you for   A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. wood that he could hardly sell any where else. I think you ought before this to have let people know that you were not to be imposed upon. It would have been money in your pocket, besides being the means of giving us often much better articles than we have had. You remember the apples Mr. Otis sold you last year for first-rate Rhode Island greenings, don't you, and how nicely they were barrelled up for you, and how Mr. Otis ,told you they would not need picking over till midwinter?  You know that we did not touch them till the first of January; and then, as we had some company that day, we thought we would get our best- apples; and you remember how they looked -little things, no more like greenings than they were like oranges, and at the bottom of the barrel there was not a sound apple to be seen." 0, yes, wife," Mr. Eldridge said, laughing most heartily at the remembrance and the earnestness of his wife in the matter; "0, yes ; I remember the apples." " Well, now, Mr. Otis knew that he could get three dol- lars a barrel out of you for those apples as well as not. He knew they were nothing but cider apples when he brought them here. I wish I had had them opened at the time- he left them, and had let him know that I could tell a Rhode Island greening from a snarly cider apple." "0, well, wife, we had better submit to all these things quietly than make a fuss and displease our parishioners." I think ministers ought not to bear all things," Mrs. Eldridge said. "If they would now and then let it be known that they understood the nature of trading, and could tell a turkey from a .goose, I think they would not be so often imposed upon." +            *      * *           * In the afternoon Mr. Eldridge and wife visited at Squire Davidson's. The squire, on the day preceding, informed them that he expected two or three clergymen, with their     THE LOAD OF WOOD.             401   wives, and some other company from out of town, and it would add much to the pleasure of the party, he had no doubt, if his pastor and lady should be with them. When Mr. and Mrs. Eldridge arrived it was somewhat late in the afternoon, as they were detained by the unexpected call of some friends from abroad. On entering the par- lor, they were somewhat astonished to notice a larger number of visitors than they had anticipated ; but, as most of the party were old friends, it was a matter of very great pleasure to them to meet so many. Whilst Mr. Eldridge was conversing with Mr. Charles Davidson in the evening, the latter gentleman alluded to the wood about which so much was said when he was at Mr. Eldridge's with his father on the preceding day. " Have you seen Mr. Conner yet ?" " 0, yes ; he called at our house this morning and pre- sented me with his bill for twelve cords of wood, at five dollars per cord." " Well, you did not pay it, I hope," Mr. Davidson. said, "No, sir I have not paid it; but I rather think I shall. I think it would be better for me to do it than to have any difficulty about it." "I would not on any account pay that price for all that wood. Father and I have talked about it considerably since we were at your house yesterday, and he thinks it would be wrong in you to do so. Mr. Conner could not recover half price for two thirds of the entire lot. Do you think he could, father ?" The old gentleman, though sitting near, and was sup- posed by the son to know the subject of their conversa- tion, but did not, responded,- " What was your question, Charles ?" "I thought you were aware that Mr. Eldridge and I have been conversing about Mr. Conner's wood, and I .34    A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE.  asked you your opinion ; but it seems you have not been listening to our conversation." " No, no," the squire observed, drawing his chair up to Mr. Eldridge; " no, I have not heard a word." "Mr. Conner has presented his bill," the son remarked, and Mr. Eldridge declines paying five dollars a cord for the whole lot." "He does right," the squire said; "yes, Mr. Eldridge, you have done right. Mr. Conner ought not to take ad- vantage of his minister as he has done." The squire, giving utterance to this remark with much energy, was heard by the whole company, and there seemed to be a general desire -to be acquainted with the history of this matter. As the clergy was somewhat largely rep- resented in the company, it was perfectly natural for such a desire to be excited by any thing connected with im- proper treatment of a minister., Mr. Davidson at once gave a history of the whole transaction about the wood, and closed by saying,- "I think ministers ought to stand up for their rights, and then they would not be imposed upon as they now often are." i I agree with you in that remark,",Mr. Sandford ob- served. "I think self-respect, if nothing else, requires our profession to let it be known sometimes that we are not all fools in the matter of trade, and that we know when we are honorably and honestly dealt by and when we are defrauded. I have suffered somewhat after the manner of brother El- dridge, though on a smaller scale. Last winter the runners of my sleigh gave out, and, as I did not feel able to buy new ones, I thought I would make a little effort to get a set that had been used some. To my inquiries after such, I was at length directed to a certain individual in my parish who was known to have such articles. I called    upon this man, a member of my church, for whom I had much regard, and who always professed to be a gireat friend to me. He told me that he had lately sold a set of runners; 'but,' said he,' I have a sleigh which I will sell you for the same price that I should ask for the runners alone.' Well, I went with him to look at it, and ascer- tained his price. 'Now,' he said, you have here a good top, which I give you, and the runners I only ask six dol- lars for.' Well, I thought the top was better than mine, and so I concluded to purchase; and I paid him six dol- lars and took the sleigh home. I had not driven a quar- ter of a mile from the man's house before I was met by one of my people, who informed me that' he had been of- fered, the day before, the same sleigh by the same individ- ual of whom I purchased it for four dollars; but he did not think it worth even that." After a hearty laugh all round, Mr. Patterson remarked that he had some experience of the same kind of good feeling, which he would rehearse for the amusement of the company. " When I left the place where I was first settled I sold off many of my things, and there remained only one article to be disposed of; and this was in my barn cellar. My deacon lived the next house to mine, and I asked him if he did not wish to purchase. He said he did; and: so he came over and looked at the heap and asked me my price. I told him I was no judge, and that I would leave the worth of it to him. He told me he thought there were two cords of it, and he would give me ten dollars. 'Well,' said I, 'deacon, if you think that is all it is worth, you may have it.' He said he would be up the next day and pay me for it. He had not been gone from the barn two hours before another individual called who resided four miles from my house. As he and I were walking about the premises, looking about, he cast his eye under the    404     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. barn and discovered the mature heap, and immediately asked what I was intending to do with it. I asked him to look at it and tell me what he judged it to be worth. He accordingly did, and said there were nearly three cords, and that he would give me fifteen dollars for it. Well,' said I, 'I have sold it to the deacon yonder for ten dollars ; but I presume he will not hold me to the bargain if I tell him what you say.' 'Well,' he said,' I will give you fifteen dollars for it if the deacon don't take it.' I imme- diately went to the deacon's, told him the offer I had just received, and asked him to release me from the sale. But, he would not do it, and did not do it, though he was a forehanded man, and knew that I needed every dollar I could possibly command." After Mr. Patterson had finished this recital there was a pretty general pouring forth of animadversion upon such ungenerous and unchristian treatment of ministers. The opinion seemned to prevail among the company that the man who would treat a clergyman thus might be guilty of far worse deeds. When remark on this subject seemed to be exhausted,- Mr. Davidson observed, "Perhaps some of the other clergymen present can give us their experience on the matter."   "Don't, Charles, don't call for morsuch facts. I am mortified now very much by what has already been said i of the disposition of people to take advantage of minis- ters, and I do not want to hear any thing more." "What is said does not alter matters in the least, father," Charles replied. "For my part, I want to see the 'whole critter,' as the man said. I should really like to hear the other ministers' account of their experience, if they have any to give." "O, well, if they are disposed to gratify you, I will not make any objection," the squire remarked. Mr, Bullard, a lawyer, was present; and, from the :   THE LOAD OP WOOD.       405 manner in which he appeared, it was evident that he had something to say touching the subject; and, to help his friend Mr. Davidson draw out from the other ministers present what was in their power to -communicate, he said, "After the clergymen have done, I have a fact or two to relate on the same subject."  So Mr. Fletcher, being directly asked if he had not something to offer, proceeded to say that he had hitherto escaped being the victim of such undue advantage as had been taken of the others who had preceded him. "But what has been said here this evening reminds me of the -case of brother Anderson, who preached for a few years near me in the next town. I have heard him and his wife tell the story with consider- able feeling; and no wonder. They did not keep house, but boarded; and they were somewhat troubled to get suitable accommodations, and so they changed pretty often. Brother Anderson became tired of this changing quarters so frequently that he came to the determination that if he could not have a steady boarding-place he would leave the places When his year was up he told the comn mittee of the parish that he must be provided with a boarding placefor a year, if he made another engagement to preach. At last a place was found. The family were pleased with the opportunity of having the minister and his wife of their number. The terms were arranged, and Mr. and Mrs. Anderson went to their new home.' By the contract, they were to remainfor one year from April, and Mr. Anderson was to have the gratuitous use of the horse and carriage when either were not wanted by the other members of the family. Three months did not pass before the man with whom Mr. Anderson boarded sold his horse; and then, when he exchanged or wished to visit remote parts of the town, he was obliged to hire; and when cold weather came, and the evenings were of some length, it became inconvenient for the family longer to accom-    406     A VOICE PROM TItI PARSONAGE. meodate the minister. ' They had -us,' Mr. Anderson said, 'when there was no expense for fel and lights; but when these were necessary it became inconvenient to accommo- date us; and so I had to look up another boarding house and to pay a higher price.' Mr. Anderson said he had no doubt the familyvdesigned to get a good price for summer board by agreeing to accommodate them for the year, and he regretted that he had been the means of having his landlord sell his horse." "That was a pity," Mrs. Patterson remarked. All eyes were now directed to the lawyer; but he said his time had not come yet; there were one or two more clergymen- to speak. "Come Mr. Murray, you have some- thing to communicate," he said. "Nothing," Mr. Murray said, "from my own experi- ence; but as Mr. Btillard seems determined not to give his story till all have spoken, I will say something to draw him out." So he remarked, "I exchanged, a few Sabbaths ago, with a brother who is preaching about twenty-five miles from me. Mr. Lasly, when he proposed the exchange, remarked that- it was a long distance, but that many of his people wished very much to hear me preach, and so he would like to gratify them. I started away from home Saturday afternoon about two o'clock; and about four I met brother Lesly on foot,* I was astonished to see him thus, for he was a feeble man, and I expressed to him my feelings. He said he did not intend to walk; that he thought there was no doubt that some of the many people who had frequently requested him to exchange with me would gladly furnish him with a horse for his accommo- dation if he should do so. 'But,' said he,'I tried yesterday in ten places, and this morning in four others, but could not succeed in getting a horse; and so, about nine o'clock, I set out on foot. I rested three hours in the middle of the day, and so I am rather late. I am very much fatigued, I and              rued, Io   THE LOAD OP WOOD.       407 assure you. Had I known that I should have been obliged to walk, I should not have proposed the exchange.'" "That was a cruel thing," said two or three voices at once." "If I had been in your place," the squire remarked, "I should have preached pretty plainly to that man's people." "It was an abominable thing," Mr. Pletcher' observed, "for that people not to let Mr. Lesly have a horse, -when he made the exchange merely to gratify them." So one and another expressed themselves, till all had said something, when one remarked,'-- "Now, Mr. Bullard, we must hear you." "I am ready now," Mr. Bullard remarked ; and at once proceeded to say, "Most of you probably know that our minister and It married our wives from- the same town, and that they were and are very intimate friends. Last spring Mr. Davis was in my office, and in the course of his call asked me if I knew who had any- good potatoes to sell. I told himn I did not, unless Mr. Barnet, the store- keeper, had them. I told him I believed we were nearly out, and proposed going immediately over to the store and see if we could not each of us obtain a supply. On our way I was overtaken by a gentleman who wishted to consult me; and so I left Mr. Davis and went back to my office, He went on and called at- the store and found some pota- toes. He engaged a barrel. When I went home tor;tea, I likewise called at the store and asked Mr. Barnet if he had any good potatoes. He told me he had some of the first quality. So I agreed to take a barrel. Mr. Barnet agreed to send them along when he sent Mr. Davis's, the next morning. We were not quite out; so the barrel was not immediately opened. The next week I was absent at court, and my wife one day thought' she would go over and make Mrs. Davis a visit. She did so, and was -persuaded to stay to dinner. .At the table   408      V OCE IPROM TRIE PARSONAGE. she observed that there were some very,excellent potatoes, and, being superior to any she had seen for some time, she was induced to ask Mr. Davis where he obtained them. He told her. She remarked her husband bought a barrel there lately, but they had not yet used any; but, she said, if they are like these, she would have the barrel opened at once. A day or two after I returned she requested me to open that barrel of potatoes, at the same time telling me of the very excellent ones she had seen on the table at Mr. Davis's. I accordingly went down cellar and opened the barrel, when, instead of there being large potatoes, I found them very small. I called my wife to come and look at them and compare them with Mr. Davis's. She came, and exclaimed at once, 'How very small they are  They don't look like those I saw at Mrs. Davis's.' 'No,' I said ; 'nor do they look like the barrel Mr. Barnet showed me.' I headed them up, and when I went to my office called at the store and told Mr. Barnet that I wished he would send and get those potatoes he sent to me the other day. 'What is the matter?' Mr. Barnet asked. '0,' I said, 'I don't want them; they are not what I bought.' Mr. Barnet at once called his Irishman, Michael, and asked him if he made any mistake in the potatoes he delivered at Mr. Bullard's; if he did not deliver the barrel he crossed as the one for Mr. Bullard. 'No,' said Michael; 'I carried that to Mr. Davis.' ' What did you do that for?' with much excitement Mr. Barnet inquired. 'Und I thut that I wud,' said Michael. 'You thought you would I Don't you know that you are to obey my orders?' 'Fath,' said Michael, 'I thut I wud like to see whut the lawyar wud do if he was sarved as ye sarve the praest.

'Shut- up, you blockhead ' Mr. Barnet vociferated as Michael was explaining and as I was laughing as if my sides would come off. 'Shut up, you blockhead, and pack up your things and be off!' As soon as I could recover myself I said to Mr. Barnet that I would keep the potatoes and would most cheerfully pay for them, and should feel a great pleasure in doing so, inasmuch as my friend the parson had been fortunate enough to have the good barrel intended for me." It is perhaps supetrfuous to add that this recital of the. lawyer's occasioned such volumes of laughter as were un- common in the quiet house of the squire. It seemed for a while that the violent shaking of sides and bending of backs might result in some serious injury to-'the whole company. The squire was so affected that he could not utter a word for many minutes; and, indeed, the power of speech seemed to be pretty generally suspended in all who  were present. At length Charles commanded himself suf- iciently to remark,-  "That was capital, I declare." ,  "How well the storekeeper was punished!" added the squire. "I think the matter ought to be published." After one and another had expressed themselves in re- ation to the lawyer's story, Mr. Bullard added,- "This affair was a good thing for Mr. Davis, and for tr. Barnet, the storekeeper, likewise. Mr. Barnet was nost effectually mortified. He took me one side after the excitement of the moment and earnestly entreated me o keep dark, and promised that Mr. Davis should be a pecial customer hereafter in another way. He kept his promise, I believe; for I have often heard Mrs. Davis say ince that Mr. Barnet's goods were much better than for- nerly, and that he had been of late very generous to hem." When the company were preparing to leave, the ladies 35 .. 1   "Os-    A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGEL being up stairs putting on their bonnets, &c., Mr. David- son stepped up to Mr. Eldridge and-remarked,-- "I really hope you will never pay Mr. Conner full price for that wood. The more I think of it, the more I am con- vinced it would be wrong in you to submit to such impo- sition." "Would you have me stand' out, if by the- act I should make Mr. Conner my enemy?"Mr. Eldridge asked. "I would not pay him the full price"' said Mr. David- son, "let the consequence be what it might." "Mr. Conner was much excited when he left our house, I assure you," Mr. Eldridge said. "I presume he was giving Mr. Otis an account of the matter," Mr., Davidson said; "for I saw him yesterday talking with the gentleman about twelve o'clock, and he manifested considerable emotion, I thought, by the ges- tures he made." "I have no doubt he has told almost every one he has met since," Mr. Eldridge said. "I am almost sorry that I did not pay him all that he demanded."   CHAPTER XXXVI. THE PASTOR'S. INTERVIEW WITH THE DEACON. ABOUT six weeks from the period at which we left Mr. Eldridge in the last chapter he was waited upon by Dea- con Smith. Whether he had been informed that Mrs. El- dridge was out of town for a day or two, and that the pastor was almost alone with his children, and was in- duced to take such a time for an interview, we know not; but it was a noticeable circumstance by Mr. Eldridge that the visit should have thus occurred. Though the pastor had recently been apprised that-the deacon- had taken ime exceptions to his course with the wayward son, and that he was consorting with Colonel Presbury in attempts at retaliation, yet, from what he thought he knew of the feelings of the multitude, he had no special apprehension that success would attend any efforts for disorganization or disrupture. Therefore he was in no way disconcerted when he found himself alone with the deacon.  The" thought, however, did not occur to Mr. Eldridge that the object of this visit was what it proved to be; and so, as had always been his manner, he treated the deacon just as if all was smooth water on which his bark was resting. The deacon for al while responded to this feel- ing, and was apparently in the same friendly humor which had for nearly twenty years characterized him whenever (411)   "2     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. he met his pastor. At length, however, the new feelings were manifested as the deacon remarked,-  "I have teen wishing, Mr. Eldridge, for some little time to converse with you upon the state of matters in our parish ; and, having a little leisure this evening, I thought I would ride up and see you." "I am pleased," Mr. Eldridge replied, "to converse upon such a subject; for my thoughts are most usually directed to the concerns of the people. Is there any thing particularly new touching the interests of the church or parish?" "I have thoughlt," said the deacon," that our pastor might not be aware of the state of things among us ; and, though it may not be a very pleasant subject for him to consider, yet others besides myself have judged that he ought to be informed in relation to it." "Please to proceed," Mr. Eldridge said. "Well, sir, to come directly to the point, there is not a little dissatisfaction with our minister. Some of the people have been dissatisfied for years, but have disguised their feelings, not being willing to create any disturbance." "I have within a few days been informed," Mr. Eldridge said, "that there were a few individuals in the parish whose feelings towards me were somewhat changed; but I have supposed that there was nothing very serious in the matter." "I do not exactly know," the deacon said, " how many are opposed; but I should think the number is not very smnall." "I have not heard that any others were opposed to me but Colonel Presbury, and yourself, and two or three more," Mr. Eldridge said. "Colonel Presbury became dissatisfied, I am informed, because he thought I had been too active in matters which did not properly concern me;   THE PASTOR'S INTERVIEW WITH THE DEACON.  413 and Deacon Smith's opposition was excited by my fidelity to his family in endeavoring to make an erring son see the error of his ways and become a blessing to his dear par- ents-and the community.^ -  "Well, sir, do you think that you pursued the proper course with our Robert?"-  TI am not aware that I pursued an improper course," was the reply, "I ever have been deeply interested in your family ; and it was a source of the deepest pain to know that Robert was in the way he was. You know, deacon, how I felt; and you probably remember how you felt at the time I called at your house when, the subject was first introduced. You are aware that you and "Mrs. Smith entreated me, with tears in your eyes, to exert myself to reclaim your son. I did endeavor to do this; and had Robert been my own child I could not have pursued a - more kind, and affectionate, and earnest course to snatch him from destruction than I did." - "Yes, sir," said the deacon, brushing away his tears, "I know you felt for us then ; but I think you went too far. ' You did not seem to think that Robert altered any for the better after your first and second interviews with bhm. I thought there was a great improvement in him; and, if you had let him alone then, I think he would have been an altered person.'" "I did think, for a week or two after may second con- versation with Robert, that he would do better, I acknowl- edge," Mr. Eldridge said; "and I kept my eye upon him, that I might have evidence of his reformation both for my comfort and your own ; but I soon discovered that, instead of improving, he was going from bad to worse. There- fore I did not let him alone, as you intimate I ought to have done. I sought for other opportunities to save him, because I felt for you and his dear mother so tenderly, and because I felt for the youth likewise." 35 - X  ,     .   "4     A VOICE FROM TIIE PARSONAGE. "I was not aware that he continued to go on in the evil way after your second interview with him," the deacon said. "I thought, from what Robert told me, that he meant to do differently, and I thought I saw good reason for be- lieving that he began to amend." "Well, deacon, had you seen all that I saw, and heard all that I heard, you would not have been thus blinded. I think Robert endeavored to deceive both you and me; and had I not been very much interested in his welfare and in the happiness of his parents, and kept a good lookout for him, I have no doubt he would have succeeded in deceiv- ing me as I fear he has you."              "Well, what you said to him made him excessively an- gry, and he has acted worse ever since; and he thinks you abused him; and I cannot- avoid thinking as he does," the deacon observed. "You are both very much mistaken," said the pastor. "Had you been present when I last conversed with your son, as I very much wish you had been, you would not have thought that I treated him otherwise than in a very kind and affectionate manner. I endeavored faithfully to  point put to him the consequences of his present career, a? and to awaken within him a resolution to reform, both for his own sake and for the happiness of his parents and the  benefit of the community." "I cannot avoid feeling," the deacon said, " that you : abused Robert, and that you have been the means of   ; making him what he now is. I thinIl you have done both him and me a lasting injury."  "I am very much surprised that you can think so," Mr. Eldridge said, " after what I have now stated to you. I amv certain you have: no cause for such a feeling as you express." "I think I have," the qdeacon said. "Robert would not be so' angry thou if you had not abused him, I know. He wil bear reproof when it is kindly given."   THE PASTOR'S INTERVIEW WITH THE DEACON. 415 "It appears to me very strange, deacon, that you have never mentioned to me before how you felt. I have seen you once or twice at least, since my last conversation with Robert, and have met Mrs. Smith likewise. I should have supposed you would have sought from me some explanation of my conduct before this. It is now nearly three months since I conversed with your son." "Well, I did not care about seeing you, I felt so about your abusing Robert," said the deacon.            , "I am perfectly astonished," Mr. Eldridge said, "at your feeling, deacon. You may rest assured you have no good cause to feel as you do. Does your wife sympathize with you? I cannot think she does, for she never treated me with more cordiality than she has of late." "My wife is not here," the deacon said. "If she was,  , she could answer for herself."            :  dI "There are quite a number of your people who feel that they can no longer be benefited by your ministry," the . -. deacon remarked; "and I thought J would call up and  X tell you of it."            - "Who besides yourself and Colonel Presbury?" "There are Mr. Dixon, Mr. Otis, and several families who live near Colonel Presbury; and there are JMr. Conner, a large number who live in his neighborhood, and--O, I cannot now think of half of them," the deacon thought- fully said. "Your refusing to pay Mr. Conner for the wood as you agreed to has made you a great many ene- mies. I was surprised when I heard of it; for Mr. Conner is a man who is much respected in town, and has consid- erable influence." "What have you heard about the wood?" the pastor inquired. "O, nothing, only that you engaged twelve cords of wood of Mr. Conner at five dollars per,io; and that,  per!:iCrd, adth,   "6     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. after the wood was all delivered, you refused to pay him." "You did not hear what kind of wood he delivered me, did you??" "No, sir." "Well, deacon, I will get my lantern, and I should' like to have you look at it. Some of it is sawed up and piled in my wood house, and some is where Mr. Conner threw it off." "I don't care about seeing the wood," the deacon said. "Well, deacon, I have no doubt, from what good judges of wood have told me, that Mr. Conner could not have sold that lot of wood for more than three dollars a cord, if he could for that sum. I was astonished, when he threw off the last seven or eight cords, that he should bring me such wood and expect full price for it; but I thought I would not say any thing about it, and I never should have t  done as I have had I not been urged very much by some of the very best judges in this place to decline paying full price for the wood. A number of people told me I ought not to pay more than thirty dollars for the lot; but Hhave offered Mr. Conner forty-five dollars, and he has refised to take the money. Have you ever heard that I made him this offer?  "Not that I remember," the deacon replied. "I think you ought to have heard of this as well as the other part of the story," Mr. Eldridge said. "What rea- sons are urged by others for their being unable to be bene- fited by my ministry?" the pastor inquired. "O, I do not know as any particular reasons are men- tioned, only that they think they should like another minister.' "Do you think, deacon, that such a elin a feein as you repre- sent is such as ought to be noticed by a pastor? ' "If I were: a minister," the deacon replied, "I should not want to preachihere a considerable portion of my hearers disliked me."   THE PASTOR'S INTERVIEW WITH THE DEACON.  417 I understand you to say, deacon, that you are dissatis- fied with me so much as to desire my removal." "That is my feeling," the -deacon said. "Do Colonel Presbury and Mr. Dixon feel as you do?" "Yes, sir, and many others. A large number of the female part- of the congregation are very anxious for a new minister." "Well, deacon, I will think of this subject," the pastor said. "I should think it best," the deacon said, "both for yourself and the parish, that you act in relation to the matter very soon. From what I know, I am confident that those who are now dissatisfied with you will never feel reconciled to your further ministry as their pastor. They will agitate and agitate until they gain their object. Now, I say this for your good, Mr. Eldridge; and I think you have : seen enough of the manner in which ministers about- you : have been dismissed to be wise enough to leave without there being made a desperate effort to effect your dismission." Act "I am obliged to you for your good feeling, deacon.  You know that I have experienced largely of your kindness for the last twenty years!"     .       ,   CHAPTER    XXXVII. REQUEST FOR A DISMSSION. THE conviption cannot have escaped the reader that Rev. Mr. Eldridge cherished high and noble views of the profession to which he was devoted, and that he consid- ered a permanent ministry had all the advantage over one , : that is transient and changing. Nor can the reader fail !":ito have noticed that he, at the outset of his pastoral con- !  nection, laid his plans broad, so that he might be unto the '  people of his charge a minister who should So them all I6' the good it were in his power to accomplish. Nor is it pos- sible for the impression not to have been made that in each successive year of his pastorate he had only one purpose of life; and that was, to spend and be spent wholly in the service of that charge which he received when a young man. There were many temptations laid in his path to swerve from so high and noble a purpose. Offers of situa- tions in many respects far more congenial to his taste, and where the emoluments would greatly transcend the salary on which he was settled, were often made to him; but from all these he at once turned, feeling that, should he intermit preaching in- the place where he took upon him ordination vows, the usefulis^ of his ministry and life would be very much abridge-":,l-He had no sympathy with that pride and ambition which often under another name, with more of the air of godliness about it, but with little of (418)   REQUEST FOR A DISMSSION.     419 its power, induces pastors to change from a limited to a larger field of pastoral labor because the opportunity for usefulness would be augmented. He contemplated the chasm left by the pastor who yields to such a "louder call," as it is termed, and saw that, however useful he might be in his new sphere, he could never repair the in- jury which was on every side round his late charge, and calling almost for vengeance upon the guilty cause. All the evils which came in consequence of the- pastor's leaving the people of his first love he would subtract-from the good he might effect in his second pastorate, and the balance of usefulness would be so small as to excite thet feeling that on the whole it would have been good for that man if he had never entered the ministry. By reason of these' con! victions, Mr. Eldridge was determined that his ministry should not be thus shorn of its usefulness, and that he, would not be the man over whom any part of his present: ' flock should weep and sigh because he left them when there ' was no cause but that of pride and ambition. It may be - he carried his views to too extreme a; point, and it may be i: he did not. The evils flowing out of a fluctuating ministry are so great, that, perhaps, if all pastors sympathized more with this feeling of Mr. Eldridge, more good might be accomplished by their ministry. Few- very few, are the occasions which will justify a pastor in sundering the solemn ties which were in so much confidence and solem- nity established at ordination. They who have watched behind where these ties have been torn asunder, and have heard the curses of the ungodly and the wailings of the saints, and witnessed evil upon evil coming down on the desolated fold by reason of the breach of so solemn a trust and pledge, feel that:thegood to be effected in the new field, let it be ever so great, can never compensate for the evils which have been occasioned in consequence of the yielding to the "loud call.".    420     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. Having continued thus long in the ministry with a high estimate of the, value of permanency in the pastoral rela- tion ; having from time to time more than intimated to the people of his charge that he should heed no overtures made to him to occupy another field ; having not only at home- frowned upon the tendency in both pastors and people to change, but abroad, when called' to sit in councils for the dismission of ministers, having raised high his voice against this most deleterious practice, - Mr. Eldridge could not be supposed to allow such a visit as the deacon made him to move him to any rash action. From the hour the deacon left him he meditated much, and that prayerfully upon the disclosures that were made to him that he ::might learn his duty in reference to them. For this:pupose he consulted one or two of his parishioners in whom he always had confided and who'were thought by him to be competent advisers in the matter. Squire Davidson, Mr. Clay, and Dr. Howard were these individ- uals. To the squire, who had been secluded by the in- firmities of age from any considerable intercourse with the people, the intelligence brought to him by his pastor of the deacon's position was entirely new. Though his daughter Frances (Mrs. Howard) had an inkling of the matter, she felt it to be her duty to manifest nothing; for she was fearful that it would be too much for her venerable father to bear. When, therefore, Mr. Eldridge broke to this standard bearer in the church the state of affairs in the parish as disclosed by Deacon Smith, it seemed:for a while that he would sink under the disclosure. He knew the fidelity of the pastor. He knew how well both church and parish had prospered under his ministry. He had indulged most joyous feelingSi!:iin anticipation of leaving the parish united and ha   der the present pastor. He, too, recalled to his memriry a great many pulpits in the adjacent community which had changed -incumbents   REQUEST FOR A DISMSSION.     421 once, twice, and some thrice, since the settlement of Mr. Eldridge; and in view of this fact he remembered how many times he had pointed people abroad to his own parish, would they learn the rich benefits of a permanent, pastorship. Likewise the squire remembered well Deacon Smith's position in relation to Mr. Eldridge for twenty years ; and then the thought that- he was now heading a faction for the purpose of rending all these his cherished sources of pleasure, and bringing sorrow to his pastor, ruin, perhaps, to the church, and certainly reproach to the cause of piety, well nigh prostrated the old veteran in Israel to the dust. "It cannot be," the squire remarked, " that any great num- bersympathize with the deacon. Iam sure it cannot be ;:and my advice to you, Mr. Eldridge, is, to think so your'selftii,'ai to take no notice of the matter. It might be well, as you have suggested, to take some opportunity to confer with Dr. Howard ; for, as he is' abroad chnsiderably in town, he : would probably know the state of feeling'as well as any one.' Mr. Eldridge soon had an interview with the doctor, which resulted in the conviction that, whatever might be the power of opposition to the pastor in the circle repre- sented by Deacon Smith, it did not reach beyond that circle and pervade the majority of the people. Mr. Clay had the same view of the matter; and both he and the doctor thought that there was no cause for Mr. lEldridge's alarm, and advised him most earnestly to continue on in the even tenor of his way. The doctor remarked that he did not believe the pastor ever had a stronger hold of the great body of the people than he had at the present time, and that he did not think it possible for Deacon Smith or Colonel Presbury to prejudice the minds of an against him unless they had better materials to wo fi!:' than they had produced. In accordance with this aHlice, which corresponded well with his own judgment, Mr. Eldridge neither in word nor 36   422     A VOICE FRO M THE PARSONAGE. action manifested any knowledge of the doinfgs of the deacon and his company; and it was agreed by the doctor and Mr. Clay that they would be perfectly ignorant of the same. They each wisely concluded that they would fur- nish tio fuel for the fire by any action or word in relation to the matter. If Deacon Smith and those confederated with him pursued their evil work, they should have no encouragement either from the pastor o r his friends. So sanguine/ was the deacon, however, in the feeling that the hints he gave his pastor would be effectual, that he really expected to hear on the next Sabbath his request for a dismission. On his wav to the house of God he remarked to his wife, that, from what he knew, he " should not be surprised if Mr. Eldridge should ask for a dis- mission to-day." He did this to prepare her for the event, knowing that she was not anticipating such a trial, and that if it came suddenly upon her she might be most severely overcome. Colonel Presbury, Mr. Dixon, Mr. Otis, Miss Bemis, and others all went to church expecting that the pastor would communicate to his people a desire to vacate his pastorate. However, they were all disap- pointed. Mr. Eldridge preached as usual, and indicated nothing from which it could be inferred that any unusual occurrence had transpired in the previous week to dis- turb him. He did the same on the sficceeding Sabbath, and on the one following that, much to the chagrin and disappointment of those who were looking for a commu- nication. The week after the third Sabbath, Deacon Smith and Colonel Presbury together called at the parson- age. They had waited much beyond the period which their patience had allotted as the full time it would be necessary for the pastor to hold -the subject under advise- -ment without any report of his feelings respecting it, and they could wgait no longer without making another effort to rouse Mr. Eldridge to action. ,Both these gentlemen, after   REQUEST FOR A DISMSSION.     423 they were seated in the room with their pastor, appeared to forget the etiquette of civilized life, and manifested more of the feelings of the forest than of the gentleman and Christian. To the pastor's courteous inquiries after their own health and that of their families nothing but dogged replies were returned, and it became at once evident to DMr. Eldridge that they were now the victims of rage and anger. "We have called," said the deacon, in the most abrupt manner, " to know if you are intending to ask for a dis- mission soon. We have been expecting for upwards of two weeks to hear such a request; and, as we have been disappointed, we would like to know if you intend to go away. Mr. Eldridge remarked," For a pastor to leave a people with whom he has been connected for twenty years there ought to be the best of reasons. Since you were here the other evening, deacon, I have thought much of the subject of your conversation, I assure you, and have been endeav- oring to learn my duty in the case.;" "Then you haven't learned it yet, I suppose," the deacon said. "Well, sir, we think that, if you knew how people felt, you would not wish to preach here another Sabbath." "I have endeavored to be advised on this point," Mr. Eldridge observed, " and I have not yet been able to learn that there is any very serious trouble away from the circle represented by yourself and your friend the colonel. I am told that this circle must be small." "It is large enough," Colonel Presbury remarked, "to make it very uncomfortable for a pastor to preach here who takes the part which Mr. Eldridge has taken." "Yes," said the deacon, " there is no doubt that the op- position to you, Mr. Eldridge, is strong enough to effect your dismission. But we do not wish to go forward in the matter! We think it would be for your benefit if you should   424   . A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. leave of your own accord! It always injures a minister very much for the parish to act first!" After this manner did the conversation continue for nearly an hour, and as the gentlemen were about leaving Deacon Smith remarlked,- "We hope you will now be induced to ask for a dismis. sion next Sabbath." This interview produced a very marked effect upon the pastor. The feelings manifested by the individuals who had called upon him were those which he never before witnessed in his parish, and they most deeply affected the sensitive nature of the pastor. For an hour or more after he was left alone Mr. Eldridge sat in the room pensive and sad. Expecting himr every moment into her own apartment after she knew his visitors had gone, and won- dering for some time why he did not come, Mrs. Eldridge at length left her needle and went to her husband. As she opened the door he raised not his head, which was reclin- ing on his hand, nor uttered a word. When she reached the chair in which he was seated he moved not nor spoke. So unusual for him was this manner that the good wife was alarmed, and nervously asked,- "Husband, what is the matter?" "I never thought it would come to this!" he with a sigh exclaimed. "I never thought it would come to this " Instantly drawing a chair to his side, Mrs. Eldridge again asked,- "Do, husband, tell me what it is that affects you sol What have Colonel Presbury and the deacon been saying?" "Their feelings I theirfeelings!" he said. "I could not have conceived it possible for Deacon Smith to cherish the spirit he manifested here this (evening. I cannot endure this any longer. I believe I shall ask for a dismission next Sabbath." "Have they said any thing new, dear?"   REQUEST FOR A DISMSSION.     425 "No, nothing; but, then, how can I be here and have even these two men feel towards me as they appear to feel?" "You must not give up to your feelings so, husband; you must rise above it. You ought to think you have -been a favored individual never before to have been treated in this manner, after having been here twenty years. Some pastors lhave to go through the same experience every year, you know. There's brother Perkins; every now and then, for a number of years past, some of his people have been to him and talked most abusively to him, and have told him he ought to go away ; but he remains yet, and is very much beloved and respected by the great majority of his society. Come, dear, don't think any thing more about it; throw it off." The efforts of the wife were successful in rallying her husband to his wonted cheerfulness and equanimity; and he retired from his room relieved and comparatively hap- py, and went with his wife to the sitting room of the family. The next day he called upon Dr. Howard and ac- quainted him with the interview of the deacon and colonel. The doctor heard all, but was not in the least impressed that any thing had been offered that ought in the least to affect the action of the pastor; and he advised him to be still, and let the deacon and colonel sweat. "' I am going round considerable to-day," he remarked, " and will call at your house this evening and report." In the evening the doctor called and gave his pastor the history of his attempts in developing the state of feeling towards him. No individual could do better on such an errand than he. Without its being knownr to the individ- uals whose pulse he wished to feel that such was his object, he succeeded well in his object, and generally found that all was right, though in a few instances he discovered some vague surmises that Deacon Smith did not appear exactly as he formerly did in relation to prayer meetings, and that his bearing towards Mr. Eldridge had somewhat changed; 36*   426     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. yet in the circuit in which the doctor travelled during the day he heard nothing to induce him to think that there was any-abatement of affection and respect for the pastor. He purposely called at certain places where he would have been likely to hear the full avowal of hostility were there any to avow. He went up into Mr. Conner's neighborhood, and was surprised to find so many speak so highly of Mr. Eldridge. He heard but a few, and those few not the most gifted and intelligent, who had any thing to urge against the pastor by reason of his- transactions about the wood. So, on the whole, he was for reaffirming to Mr. Eldridge the advice given after the first visit of the deacon -to take no notice whatever of the second call. He. remarked "that both Squire Davidson and Mr. Clay, whom he had seen that day, agreed with him perfectly in opinion upon the matter." In the course of a few days Mr. Eldridge thought he would call here and there in the parish, that he might discover any new light on his pathway if any existed. Wherever he went he was welcomed with the same confid- ing, affectionate feeling as ever. He heard many things that encouraged him greatly in his way; and he returned home ' with the conviction that he should not on the next Sabbath propose to have his relations to his people sundered. In this position he continued through the week; and on the Sabbath he preached as usual, and pronounced the benedic- tion in the afternoon, without gratifying the few who were looking for a special communication from him to the church and parish. The next morning, as he opened the front door of his house, he noticed a letter on the step below to his address. As he opened it and looked for the name of its writer, he discovered that it was anonymous. He then proceeded to its perusal, and found it filled with the most severe- sayings, couched in the coarsest of our vernacular. He folded it up, and returned with it to his study, where he deposited it in a secure place. In the course of the   REQUEST FOR A DISMSSION.     427 reek he received several others - some through the post ffice, and some at his own door or in his yard. They "bore one character and had the same design. Of all lese he made no mention to any one, not even to his wife. y them he was not much affected; for he thought they "emanated from the same source, and were intended as substitute for a third visit. The next Sabbath he ex- langed, but he did not leave any communication to be iad to his people. At the close of the afternoon service, hen the people were dispersing for their homes, Deacon nith was observed to be moving rapidly about as if in arch for some individual. Dr. Howard, noticing the ct, thought he would not be much in haste, and accord- gly loitered about at his leisure. He soon found the 2acon was in the rear of the church, surrounded by sev- al individuals whom he recognized as belonging to the ction of which he was the life. Having ascertained all at he wanted, the doctor moved along towards his home. In the early part of the week the doctor met the dea- n, when the latter asked him if .he, was aware what a  ; eadful state the parish was in. The doctor replied that was not. "Have you not heard any thing from Mr. Eldridge out, it," the deacon eagerly asked. "Mr. Eldridge has said something to me respecting one two calls which you have made him recently," the doc- r said.                          A "He told you what I said to him then, I suppose?" the  i ctor continued. "I presume- he did," was the reply. "Well, doctor, if the man don't take himself off, I fear ere will be serious trouble here." "I do hot agree with you," the doctor responded. "Well," said the deacon, "you will see before long, if r. Eldridge does not very soon ask for a dismission. "I do not see any call for this," the doctor remarked.  :   428    A VOICE FROM TeE PARSONAGE. "I hear of no opposition to Mr. Eldridge but that which comes from you, and Colonel Presbury, and a few others over whom you have influence. I tell Mr. Eldridge to be still and go on as usual." "Yes, yes;" the deacon said. " Well, doctor, you don't hear much said in the parish, I know. All who are op. posed to Mr. Eldridge have determined that we would not act out at present. We want that he should quietly leave. If he believes me, he might know that there is great oppo- sition to him. Now, doctor, I tell you what -just let Mr. Eldridge ask for a dismission, and then, if there be not a fair vote to grant it, I will guaranty that all will be satisfied who are now opposed to him. I think-it would be great- ly to his advantage to ask for a dismission. If he does not he will have a hard time of it here, I am persuaded." Mr. Clay had a conversation with Colonel Presbury about the time of the interview between the doctor and the deacon ; and in the course of the week Colonel Pres- bury met Mr. Eldridge in the street and conversed with him for a long time ; and the result was -of all this con- versation with' Mr. Clay, the doctor, and Mr. Eldridge- that it was mutually thought advisable, all things consid- ered, for the request for a dismission to be made by the pastor on the next Sabbath. Both the doctor and Mr. Clay were strong in the opinion that it would not be granted, and Mr. Eldridge had become so -much annoyed by thte opposition as to desire most strongly to have the feelings of the people tested. The next Sabbath was a memorable day in the parish of Mr. Eldridge. Outwardly it was a day of sunshine and pleasantness; and, by reason of the propitious weather, -there was a large assembly in the house of God. The pastor never was more solemn and eloquent in his services, and the people apparently were never more impressed. Before pronouncing the benediction in therafternqon, Mr. Eldridge remarked that he had a communication to   REQUEST FOR A DISMSSION.     429 present, and requested the assembly to be seated. He then proceeded to read his request for a dismission. The docu- ment was brief and to the point. He remarked that it had ever been his purpose to remain among his present charge until removed by death or prevented from being useful by any dissatisfaction towards him among his peo- ple. Statements recently had been made to him, and feel- ings exhibited, which led him to ask if the time had' not now arrived when he could be no longer generally useful to his people. He could not answer the inquiry, but the people could; and it was his desire that they would ac- cordingly give expression to their feeling. If the ex-. pression should be in favor of his leaving, he requested the church to unite with him in the call of a mutual coun- cil for the purpose of their advice in the premises. Though he was calm when speaking, his people were deeply affected when hearing. Never before, probably, were more tears shed in that large house on one occasion than then. Never before, perhaps, did the people linger more, as if reluctant to- leave their slips, than then. When the pastor descended from the desk he was surrounded by his weeping parishioners, and, as it were, with one voice asked, "What does all this mean, Mr. Eldridge?" "We shall not let you go." "Who has been making statements to you? ' At last, however, the sorrowing congregation separated. It was frequently wished by some who were in the secret that Deacon Smith and his company had not been in such haste to leave the church when the services were over. It was thought that, had they been present, a rebuke would have been administered in terms that would have never been forgotten by them. They knew, however, that they had plunged the dagger, and did not care to witness its cruel effects.   CHAPTER     XXXVIII. PARISH MEETING AND COUNCIL. How could the request detailed in the preceding chapter be made without producing the greatest commotion? All classes were roused by it, and every household circle had it for a common theme of conversation. Although some of the people were aware that Deacon Smith and a few others were restless and-attempting the sundering of ties which had most happily and prosperously bound both pas- tor and 'people for twenty years, yet more were in entire ignorance of the whole matter. The multitude felt that Mr. Eldridgeias as much as ever in possession of the love and confidence of the people, The few who were apprised that the waters of strife were being stirred did not realize that any disastrous con- sequence would follow. They relied for the safety of the parish and the protection of the pastor upon what they supposed was the general love and respect of the people for Mr. Eldridge. Whatever Deacon Smith and those leagued with him might attempt, it was supposed by such individuals as Doctor Howard and Mr. Clay that-all their efforts would be futile. When the great body of the peo- ple were enlightened in'the course which had been pur- sued to provoke a request for a dismission, they, too, were not at a loss for the disposition such a request would have from a parish vote. Consequently all the friendl of Mr. (430)   PARISH MEETING AND COUNCIL.    481 Eldridge were impatient for the time to arrive when they could turn back this current which had been set in motion for the destruction of the quietude of the pastor and the peace and prosperity of the parish. They were persuaded that this might be- most easily accomplished, and the bright prospects of their Zion in the continued usefulness of the pastor be fully restored. If the rebuke which might be administered in an overwhelming vote of both church and parish in favor of the pastor should not indicate to the opposition their complete impotency to do with Mr. Eldridge as they pleased, and thus lead them to retrace their steps and again be his friends and supporters, it was supposed that these individuals would at once leave and become attached to another religious community, and thus be no longer the means of dissension in their present re- lations. It was felt and argued that no increased burden would be imposed upon the parish should such be the result. In the course of a week from the Wednesday following the Sabbath on which Mr. Eldridge communicated his re-- quest for a dismission, there was a meeting of the church for action upon it. It was a full and solemn meeting. To the dismay of all, neither Deacon Smith :nor the two or three other brethren in sympathy with him were present. The deacon well knew the position of his brethren in the church in relation to the pastor. He well knew that he almost stood alone, and that his conduct had deeply wound- t ed many a heart and exposed him to the almost general censure of his brethren. He had not the manliness, the moral courage, the encouragement: of an approving con- science which were requisite to enable him to confront those whose peace he had invaded and whose prospects he had attempted to cloud and freely and ungenerously to state the motives by which he lad been governed. The communication of the pastor was read and duly consid- ered, and the vote in relation to it taken, from-!which it   432     A VOICE PFROM THE PARSONAGE. appeared that all the brethren present were in favor of the continuance of the present pastoral relation. Because so genera! a development was made at this meeting of the greatestP -onfidence' in and affection for the pastor, all who were present felt :themselves greatly comforted and strengthened in their convictions that the enemy would be easily foiled.' The parish meeting soon followed. When that oc- curred it was a most exciting day; for every one was im. pressed that there was to be a most important contest. The enemy might cower in the church and refuse a manly struggle, and yet on the whole no important advantage bo lost; but in the parish there must be action, or there would be defeat; for the law has cognizance only of civil trans- actions, and lays no claim to jurisdiction over those which are ecclesiastical. All seemed to feel that there was some- thing to. be done; and -at the hour at which the parish meeting was called a very large body of people had col- lected in the vestry where the meeting was held. It seemed as if every voter was present to share in the trans- actions which were anticipated. Squire Davidson, to the surprise of almost every individual, was out. Though long confined almost to the house with the infirmities of age, and, as he supposed, done with the active scenes of this world, yet his heart being deeply affected by the attempts which were making to remove his most highly-esteemed pastor firom the pulpit he had long honored and the people he had so usefully and faithfully served, the squire girded himself up for the hour of battle, and appeared in the vestry with that energy and interest which perfectly aston- ished every one present. His son Charles, who for years had been a resident in the town where he was born, having left Virginia soon after the death of his mother for the purpose of relieving- his father by his sympathy and care, was likewise no uninterested individual in this assembly.   PArISU MEETIXG AND COUNCILs     43{ Always in many respects like his father, in later years the resemblance became more complete by the addition -of 6th graces of the Cliristian, to whose power he had -ielded his hear t almost from the date of his return to his pr8sent-home. Little Arthur, who was there twenty years before when Mr. Eldridge was ordained, was in this meeting, and in- vested with no small interest in its results; for he Was now an inhabitant of the town, and in the occupanc of the store over which his grandfather so long, so honorably, and so successfully presided. The attendance at the meet- ing was s6 large that it would be by far the easiest task to mention the names of the few in Mr. Eldridgo'S parish who were absent than to draw up a Catalogue of those who were present. It was generally reported all were out at this meeting but such as tvere detained at ihome by infirmity and sickness. Of course, then, Deacon Smith Was thei-e. Ye', the deacon was there, and all his league. There were more in the parish than in the church who were in symipa thy with him in his feelings towards the pastor, and con- sequently there was a shield here in ain indJeasod num- ber, which emboldened him to appear. Though thewealth of Colonel Presbiiry and the influence which opulenice often imparts were with himn, yet the deacon was vdry far from exhibiting in his countenance a happy frame of spirit. As he entered the vestry, and before the meeting was or- ganized, he had every indication of a fear that he was a condemned man it the judgment of those with whom he had long been in fellowship in sustaining his pastor and forwarding the best interests of the parish, and-a con. sciousness, too, that his own soul well approved, as most merited, this condemnatioti. He and the colonel Were soon seated together, and heair them were the minions who had aided them in bringing matters thus far to the interruption of pastoral peace and of parochial prosperity. 37   484     & VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. After the organization of the meeting and the-reading of the communication of the pastor, the committee of the church pesented to the parish the action of that body in relation;At6o" it. -Wherelupon a motion was immediately offered that the parish concur with the church in the dis- position of the pastor's request for a dismission. This motion was made by a friend of Mr. Eldridge, who sup- posed that it would beat once carried by a large majority, and  thus the unpleasant business of the meeting be summa- rily despatched, to the confusion ,and shame of those who had been laboring for another result. Other members of the parish and ardent friends of the pastor were not in- clined to have the matter thus pass off. They wished a disclosure from those who had been active in creating the present excitement of the reasons by which they had been governed; and so, as one and another opposed the motion, the mover thereof at once withdrew it. A pause now ensued. It was expected that some of the individuals to whom it belonged to make this disclosure would at once be sufficiently magnanimous to gratify the assembly with a statement of the ground of their opposition to the pas- tor; but this magnanimity did not appear. At length Doctor Howard, after a conference with Squire Davidson and :r. Clay, arose and gave to the meeting a history of the difficulties as lie understood them, and concluded by calling on Deacon Smith and Colonel Presbury and in- quiring of them if what he had narrated was not correct. These gentlemen could not now well be silent. They had been publicly implicated, and necessity was laid upon them to speak. Deacon Smith accordingly arose and remarked that he had, it was true, been dissatisfied for some time with his pastor, and that others were likewise dissatisfied. He supposed that Mr, Eldridge, upon becoming acquainted with the fact that the feelings of many of his parishioners had changed towards him, would at once perceive that he   PARISH MEETING AND COUNCIL.     435 could no longer be as useful in his present relations as he had been, and thus be disposed in a silent manner to seek a dissolution of his connection with this people and enter another field of labor. He further remarked that he had, in company with Colonel Presbury, called upon the pas. tor and made to him a statement of the difficulties in re- lation to him. Colonel Presbury followed, and briefly recapitulated the statements of the deacon, but not in the least degree hinting at any conduct of the pastor which had provoked his dissatisfaction. The indefiniteness of these remarks from the head of the opposition to Mr. El- dridge impressed the multitude present with great dismay. It was supposed that, when Deacon Smith and Colonel Presbury were drawn forth to define their position, they would at length give their reasons for their conduct in the form of complaints or charges against the pastor; But no; all that they uttered was the simple fact that f they and some others were dissatisfied Squire David- son, it was observed, sat ill at ease after this expose of the opposition, and at once rose and begged the privilege of putting a few questions to Deacon Smith. He asked him how long he had been with his present feelings towards his pastor. To this it was replied, "Not a year." "What was the cause of his opposition?"Here the dea- con rendered several evasive answers, which of course were unsatisfactory to his intelligent and searching cate- chist. "Was not the beginning of your opposition the fidelity of the pastor with your son, in whose behalf you entreated him with tears to interpose, that he might be saved from ruin?"The deacon here was dumb. "Did you not," continued the squire, ",say to a certain individual that your son had deceived you in relation to his prom- ised reformation, and that Mr. Eldridge had moreeyes than yourself, and consequently was better informepenn re- spect to the course your son was pursuing than you were, /r1   4^6     A VOICJi PROM 'tilt PASONAGE. and that, had you known at the beginning all that you subsequently ascertained, your feelings towards Mr. El. dridge whuld have been different??"To this the deacon made no reply. "Have ybu not said;" the sqbire further asked, " that you thousht our pastor had no business with the conduct of individuals- that it was wrong for him to seek out the fadilts of cliildreii and youth in his parish and blazen them forth to the world?"To these inquiries the deacon answered not a word. "As the deacon is not inclined to reply to questions like those I have put. to him," the squire remarked, " will in- quire of himi further, if he was not well satisfied with Mr. Eldridge up to the time that he requested him to endeavor to save his son." The deacon at once replied that he was. "Was it not your opinion a year ago that Mr. Eldridge had the confidence and respect of all classes in the parish, and that he had been from yeair to year increasing in his usefulnhbss odnitng the people?"The deacon replied it was. "Havre yoti hot for twenty years thought that Mr. Eldridge was pecuiliarly adapted to this people; and have you not, both in town and out, ofteti declared such' as your opinion?" "Of course I have," the deacon Said. "Now, then," said the squire, "I will ask ybo one more question. Do ySoti thitik it fair ahd right to change your feelings towards a Castor for beinig faithful iii doing what you earnestly requested himi tO do? It Seems that ybiti son became eniaged at the wathhfuliiess and fidelity of Mr. Eldridge, and that you have 'sympoathized with him andi becorme an enemy to ybur pastor, and been doinig all that you -could do for his injiry. Now, deacon, is this righit?' The deacon was evidently sensible of his position, and yet at a loss to know how to extricate himself firot it". He appeared to catcli the popular feeling that it was unfor-  tunate for him to reply th soriie questions and be silent in relation to others; and so he rallied his energies and   PARISH MEETING AND COUNCIL.     437 attempted to answer the squire's last questions, but most egregiously failed. He justified himself in his opposition to Mr. Eldridge, and affirmed that he never could& again be reconciled to him as his minister. Having drawn from the deacon thus much, which was sufficient to show his palpable inconsistency, most glaring treachery, and excessive cruelty to his pastor, the squire turned to the colonel for the purpose of ascertaining his reasons for being desirous that his pastor should leave. The colonel instantly responded that he had been dissatis- fied with Mr. Eldridge for many years. He thought that he had g6ne out of his proper sphere of action frequently and concerned himself with matters which ought not to have occupied his attention. Though he had been thus opposed, he had not made his feelings any way public un- til recently. He did not wish to injure the minister; and therefore, whilst others were satisfied with him, he Was not disposed to disturb them in their enjoyment. The colonel proceeded some time in this course of general, indefinite remark, and of course did not satisfy any of those who wished for some tangible matter in relation to the conduct or preaching of Mr. Eldridge. Squire Davidson, as Col- onel Presbury was about taking his seat, observed, that he would be pleased to have the gentleman a little more ex- plicit in his declarations of dissatisfaction with the pastor. For this purpose he would inquire, "How many years since the colonel became dissatisfied with the pastor?" The colonel replied "it must be ten or twelve since he first began to dislike him; and that he had been growing more and more dissatisfied ever since." "What was the occasion of this dissatisfaction," the squire asked, "ten or twelve years ago? It must have been excited by some act or actions of the pastor, or by some discourse or discourses of his; and he would like to have the gentleman particular and explicit in the matter." 37    488     A VOICE FROM THE PARSBONAGE. The colonel replied " that he had thought for years that Mr. Eldridge allowed himself to attend to things foreign to his profession." "What things? "What things?" inquired several indi- viduals at oice:. "Yes," said the squire, " what things, colonel, are there with which otir pastor has been imprudently concerned?" Whilst the colonel Was reflecting a moment for a reply his cogitations were assisted by the inquiry from a num- ber of voices, if the old parish debt was -not one of the things, and repairing the church and supplying it with an organ another. "Yes," said the colonel; "I confess these two things are what have disgusted me with our minister. -I think a parish ought to be allowed to pay its own debts and to repair its meeting house when and how it pleases. A minister has no business to meddle with these affairs." Mr. Clay then inquired of the 'colonel " if he were not in favor of having the old parish debt liquidated, and if he did not often say, before it was paid, that the parish ought to sell their lands and pay their debts." The colonel replied that he was desirous of laving the debt paid with the proceeds of the sale of the lands. He was then asked if Mr., Eldridge ever expressed an opinion as to the manner in which the debt should be paid, and if the debt was not paid as the parish saw fit to have it. He replied that Mr. Eldridge never expressed any other opinion on the subject, as he was aware, but that the parish debt should be paid, and that the parish voted to pay it by tax. "Then why attach any blame to fMr. Eldridge in this mat- ter?"Squire Davidson asked; "as you allow the debt ought to be paid, and that the parish voted that it should   PARISH MEETING AND COUNCIL.     43 be paid by a tax, and that Mr. Eldridge e&er expressed any opinion in confict hith your own in relat'ii to the mnatter." "Now, colonel," inquired' the squire, " were you not in favor of repairing the church?" "Yes; I was," the colonel -said ; "but I wished it done by subscription, and not by a tax." "Bid Mr. Eldridge advocate a tax?" "Not that I ever heard, the colonel replied. "Then," said the squire, "why blame -Mr. Eldridge in the matter? He was for having the debt paid, and thef he was for having the church repaired, because he con- ceived the prosperity of the parish would be thereby greatly advanced. He said nothing of the manner in' which these things should be accomplished, but left it to the consideration of the people. Why bldme r. 'Eldridge, colonel?" the squire asked, with mudh emotion. "It seems that you were dissatisfied with the parish for thiink- ing it proper to have the debt paid and the church re- paired by a tax, and that you seek revenge for the doings of the parish on the poor minister. He must be dismissed because the parish voted to do thus and so, though he had not any influence whatever in the doings of the parish, nor had he attempted any influence." Dr.. Hiward here remarked, "that he had understood the colonel to say that he had confined his opposition to Mr. Eldridge within his own breast until recently, because he was not disposed to interrupt the enjoyment of any in thgir pastor. If this has been his position," thedoctor ob- served, " ruwor has done him great injustice ; for he had been charged with having said, when the tax was made for the repairs of the church, that he Wsould in some way or other effect the dismission of Mr. Eldridge. In accordance With this assertion, this same rumor had charged the colonel with having purchased the store now  occupied by Mri.  Dixon for the very purpose of having a place of rendezvous   "O     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. where recruits in the war against the pastor mightlbe drilled, and from whence an influence should go out to the hurt of the pastor. This same rumor has charged him with having opened his house for secret meetings to devise ways and means for effecting the dismission of Mr. El- dridge, and with having suggested to Mr. Otis to say to Mr. Conner, who was then supplying the pastor with wood, that he had better put in small trash, and yet charge the same price as for merchantable wood, promising him if he would do this vile thing that he would liberally reward him. These and other charges rumor has made against the colonel," the doctor remarked, " and he believed there was considerable evidence at hand to show that she has in these things not charged falsely." Colonel Presbury now found himself in an uncomfortable condition, which he manifested in abuse of the doctor and others in no measured terms. He did not deny the charges which had been recited by the doctor, but very boister- ously and vehemently declaimed against the pastor, and said, if he were not dismissed, the parish would be broken to pieces. Mr. Charles Davidson inquired of Deacon Smith " if he or those opposed to Mr. Eldridge thought that there was any abatement in the pastor's power in the pulpit or ac- tivity among the people."    * The deacon replied, "thathevery one confessed that Mr. Eldridge was a good preacher, and a diligent scholar, and an active minister. We all know these things," the deacon said; "but, then, there is now, such a prejudice against him that we think it willbe mostfor his comfort, usefulness, and reputation that he labor in some other community." At this stage of the meeting Squire Davidson arose and remarked, " that it must be evident to all the parish what were the reasons which had governed thel opposition to the pastor. Colonel Presbury became dissatisfied because the   PARISH MEETING AND COUNCIL.    441 parish saw fit to raise a tax for the liquidation of the old parish debt and for the repairing of the church. The colonel admits that he was in favor of both these measures, but wished to have the manner of raising funds for their execution different. He admits that Mr. Eldridge, to his knowledge, never expressed any opinion in relation to the way in which the debt should be paid or the money for the repairs of the church be raised, and yet he grounds his dissatisfaction with the pastor on the sermons which he preached to stir up the people to accomplish these very desirable objects. Had there been no tax, it is clear the colonel would never have been opposed to the pastor. Had the parish lands been sold for the one object, and a subscrip- tion made for the other, the colonel thinks he would have been saved a few hundred dollars! Because he could not do this he comes down with all his vengeance upon the minis- ter, and must have him dismissed. In regard to Deacon Smith," the squire observed, "the case was simply this. His son became enraged with the pastor for doing what the father, with tears in his eyes,- besought the good man to do. The wayward child deceived his father, and made him believe that the pastor was excessively uncharitable, and unreasonably severe and slanderous in his accusations; and so the deacon at once sympathizes with the son, and, t without any conference with the pastor for explanation, be- comes his inveterate enemy. Now," continued the squire, "these two individuals, Colonel Presbury and Deacon Smith, have fomented all the excitement which exists against the pastor. About the period that the deacon's feelings became estranged towards Mr. Eldridge Colonel Pres- bury had many logs at the deacon's mill to be sawed. Consequently he and the deacon were often together, and it became manifest to each other that both felt alike to- wards the pastor; and from this time have they acted together in relation to his dismission. There have always   "2     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONAGE. been those in the parish (it is so in every parish) who are ready to take up arms against the minister under certain influences which are excited by wealth and station. These 'individuals have been summoned forth by the deacon and colonel; and there has been, it seems, constant agitation for nearly a year in secret places, and always under covert, for the purpose of effecting the dismission of our minister. This agitation has been begun and carried on by the in- fluence of Deacon Smith and Colonel Presbury ; and if Mr. Eldridge should be dismissed, these two individuals will have been the whole cause of such dismission. But for them there would now have been peace and prosperity in this church and parish."^ Colonel Presbury'and Deacon Smith each replied to the squire,-and they were both understood to admit that they were not assigned a false position by the gentleman who last spoke. They both urged the necessity of -Mr. El- dridge's dismission on the ground: that, if he did remain, there would be a great falling off in the congregation, as a. new meeting house would be immediately built and an- other church and society formed. To this a number of individuals replied at much length, and illustrated in a variety of ways the impossibility of another society being able to gather sufficient strength to live and flourish. Evening now being near, and as many present resided remotely from the place of meeting, a motion was made for an adjournment- for two weeks. From the manner in which this motion was. received, it was evident that the meeting was not yet, prepared for an adjournment. From several parts of the house the desire was expressed that there might be a declaration of feeling in relation to the main business of the meeting; viz., to act upon the com- munication of the pastor. Accordingly, for the gratifica- tion of, this desire, the motion. for adjournment was with-   pARISH MEETINOG AND COUNCIL.    4 drawn, when Mr. Clay moved that the parish concur with the church in its disposal of the request of Rev. Mrb Eldridge for a dismission. As soon as this motion was seconded, Colonel Presbury arose and, addressed the meet- ing at, great length. He set forth the ease with which the whole diffculty might be settkd by the quiet withdrawal of th pastor to another field of labor, which he doubted not he could soon find. He spoke of the evils of having two societies, where, in reality, only one was needed ; and he urged all to consider well before they voted on the mo- tion now before. them. Mr. Otis, Mr. Dixon, and one or two others of the op- position spoke pretty much after the manner of the colo, nel. The motion being now called for by several voices, it was put, when it was discovered that but nineteen were in the negative. When this vote was declared it was apparent that the opposition were surprised at the comparative, smallness of. their number. They manifested such surprise by an at- tempt for a reconsideration of the vote, in which,. through the courtesy of one of the majority in moving. for such re- consideration, they were successful. The meeting was then adjourned for two weeks, Deacon Smith and the colonel, on the next day after this meeting, were seen earnestly engaged in conversation with different people belonging to the parish. It was thought that they were invested with, new zeal in their op- position to the pastor; for almost every subsequent day brought the report of their activity hither and thither in the parish. It was soon found that they were pursuing a different policy -from that which had hitherto governed them. Instead of cautiously conversing with individuals to ascertain how strong were their sympathies for the pas- tor, and never betraying their own hostility when such sympathy was strong in his, favor, they now boldly avowed   "4    , A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. their dissatisfaction, and urged all who would not have the church and parish rent asunder to favor the dismission of Mr. Eldridge. Instead of waiting for individuals to come in their way, they now went about among the fainil lies and endeavored to bring all over to their own views of church and parish duty and interest. It would have been singular if, by such a course, they had not succeeded in shaking the faith of some and changing the policy of others. The deacon would urge a variety of reasons as occasion might demand to induce those whom he called upon to change their vote. He would appeal to the ava- rice of some by showing how much more the taxes would be for parish purposes if Mr. Eldridge should continue. He would appeal to the pride of some whose boast had often been that their parish was remarkable for its unity and for the accommodating spirit of its members. He would address-the pacific feelings of some by portraying the many evils which would come upon the people if there should be two rival societies. Whether by the efforts of the deacon or colonel or not the change was effected, it is not known; but it began to be rife in the community be- fore the expiration of the time for which the parish meet- ing was adjourned that several had altered their minds, and, all things considered, that they thought it would be best for tfie people and best for Mr. Eldridge if he should go. Many of these spoke in the highest terms- of the pastor, and deeply regretted the necessity for his leaving, when, had they stood firm, -and had all stood firm, there would have been no such necessity, though Deacon Smith and Colonel Presbury had not abated aught of their active hostility. In consequence of its being believed that the rumor above noticed was correct, it was judged best by Mr. El- dridge and some of his best friends at last, in consequence of his wishes to have it so, that if at the parish meeting it should be found that any very considerable number, though   PARISH MEETING AND COUNCIL.     445 not amounting to a majority, should deem it expedient for him to leave, for all to acquiesce in the measure. The day to which the parish meeting was adjourned having arrived, at the hour appointed might have been seen about the same attendance as at the previous meet- ing. As the attention of the parish was called to the fir'st business, to wit, the consideration of the pastor's request for a dismission, Mr. Babcock, one of the pastor's friends, arose and remarked that he had a motion to make which might astonish and pain many who should hear it. "Since the last meeting," he continued, "I have hardly thought long upon any other subject but the one which has here called us together ; and I have come to the conclusion that for the sake of peace, for the sake of preserving together this parish, it might be best for our pastor to leave us. If he should, I feel that I can never again have so faithful and instructive a pastor; but, for the sake of peace, I am willing to give him up! I therefore move that in the opinion of the parish, all things considered, it is best that the relation of Mr. Eldridge as pastor should-be dissolved." Though it was known that Mr. Babcock was an amia- ble and lovely man, yet it was a matter of surprise to all that he should make such a motion, because of his strong attachment to his pastor. This act of his was con- sidered as a precursor of a somewhat general change of feel- ing on the part of Mr. Eldridge's friends, and of course it was felt by some that the question was virtually decided that the pastor must leave. There was much discussion under this motion of the whole matter, in which a large. number of individuals participated. Squire Davidson, Dr. Howard, and many others with great feeling opposed the motion ; whilst it was advocated, not only by Deacon Smith and Colonel Presbury, but by several who were known to be true friends to the pastor. These last advocated the dissolution of the pastoral relation entirely on the ground 38   "6     A YOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. of expediency ; and some of the thrusts which were made at Deacon Smith and Colonel Presbury for their agency in bringing matters to the present crisis were so direct and se- vere as to make it almost impossible for them to consider those individuals, though with them in the present measure, as with them in any other. At length the vote was taken, and it appeared that fifty-two were in favor of the motion. This vote, though by no means approaching a third, was deemed by some of the pastor's friends who had his pecu- liar confidence as being such a test of feeling as he desired, should decide the question of his remaining. Accordingly it was moved that the last vote be reconsidered, which was done; when the same motion was made and put again, and carried by forty-three votes in favor and none against. The church soon after had a meeting for the considera- tion of this matter; and inasmuch as a vote had been carried in the parish in favor of the dismission of Mr. El- dridge, the church so far acquiesced in the arrangement as to vote to unite with the pastor in the calling of a council to submit the whole matter to them for adyice. It may appear strange to those who take a. cursory view of the subject that such a change should have been effect- ed il the feelings of Mr. Eldridge's parishioners as to bring matters thus far to favor his dismission. Many con- siderations in the period of dissatisfaction with a minister affect the judgment of a people. When the question of his dismission is remote, for the reason that the majority do not think it probble that the, liena tion existing in the breasts of a few will, ever amount to any thing, it is very common for them to, feel and to act as though they would part with a right hand as soon as part with their pastor. But when this alienation waxes into hot opposition and it looks as if there would be serious trouble to the church and parish unless the cause of it be removed, then many who are en- tirely satisfie with their pastor begin to think that, on te   PARISH MEETING AND COUNCIL.     447 whole, the easiest and surest way to quell the storm and bring back harmony in the different circles of the community is for the pastor to leave. It will be but a little thing for him to look up another parish, and then the one he leaves will be tranquil and happy!  Thus easily is a minority, a small minority, of malcontents in a parish successful by the votes of those who all along have condemned their course. Thus it is that such malcontents are encouraged in their work of mischief and ruin. In due time a council assembled, in accordance with the invitation of the church and pastor. They spent two days and a half in hearing testimony and in canvassing the matters submitted to their consideration, and at length arrived at a result, of which the following is the sub- stance: - "The council have, with carefur and patient delibera- tion, examined into the condition of the church and peo- ple. They are entirely satisfied in the belief that for twenty years Rev. Mr. Eldridge had in a remarkable de- gree the love and confidence of his people. This position he enjoyed, as the council think, because of his uniform character for prayerfulness, for fidelity in preaching the true doctrines of the Bible, for fostering with lively inter- est the various benevolent societies bf the day, and for his interest in all classes of his parish. The young and the old, the rich and the poor, have alike been the objects of his faithful interest and care. From the testimony sub- mitted there cannot be a doubt that the pastor has been a most laborious student and a most faithful shepherd; and the council extremely regret that he should have been in- terrupted by any:dissensions among the peoplein his useful labors and in carrying out the cherished purpose of his life. The- council have had no evidence presented to them for showing that the pastor has not been wise and prudent. On the contrary, much has been submitted   "8     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. which presents- him as distinguished in a remarkable manner for wisdom and discretion, and for having those traits of character which fit him for extensive useful- ':, nss. :'4P:;!n the present situation of both pastor and people we :have striking proof of the power of an individual to pro- duce alienation and strife--to produce discord and ca- lamity. Truly 'one sinner destroyeth much good.' It seems, by the evidence before the council, that one indi- vidual took offence for having been obliged to pay a tax at two distinct periods and for different objects when he thought the parish could have gained their purposes in another manner. Because the pastor called attention in his sermons to these different objects, which required the attention of the parish, would they look out well for their own prosperity, this individual became inimical to him, though he confessed that the pastor had advocated nothing more than what was reasonable and proper. If the pastor had not preached two sermons, -one in favor of liquidating an old parish debt, and the other in favor of remodelling the church, - this wealthy individual thought there would have been no call for money, and thus his own purse would have been untouched. Because it was touched, he became dissatisfied with the pastor and vowed vengeance upon him. So craftily, though slowly, this individual endeavored to undermine the pastor; but it probably would have been a hopeless undertaking had not an officer of this church confederated with him.. When the council consider the circumstances in which Deacon Smnith was when he avowed opposition -to his pastor, they are overwhelmed with the deepest sorrow at the ingratitude which followed the faithful efforts of the pastor to restore an erring son toQ his right mind, to the arms of an affec- tionate father. From these two individuals, therefore, the council are convinced the present difficulties in the parish   PARISH MEETING AND COUNCIL.     449 have arisen. Had Colonel Presbury and Deacon Smith not allowed themselves to act as they have acted, we are satisfied we should have had no duties to discharge here. The council exceedingly regret that the pas tor's friends di?:, not all of them remain steadfast. Had they done so, there; probably would have been no cause for the rupture of tles which have bound pastor and people for so many years.  Had they remained steadfast, they had not encouraged evil doers in their work of iniquity. "As matters now -are in the parish, the council see no other alternative for the settlement of their difficulties but the dismission of the pastor. Though painful in the ex- treme to them, they do advise to his dismission ; and they most sincerely commend him to the churches as a most able and efficient minister of the Lord Jesus Christ. "The-council would sympathize with their deai brother in his blasted hopes. They know his views - and greatly appreciate them- of the importance of the permanent ministry, and they deeply deplore the unrighteous causes which have severed him from  a people to whom he has been singularly useful, and in whose service it was his hope to remain till death. Their prayer is, that he may be divinely sustained and directed." 38* ,              Z%   IT Would be difcult to discover stronger emotions to- watds those not connected with an individual by the bonds of nature than what the faithful pastor cherishes towards the people of his charge. His grand purpose of life, one forwhich his entire education and his complete energies arthe consecrated, being to serve his Lord and Savior here upon the earth in gathering unto him many sons and daughters, it is impossible for him to have any other feel- ings towards the people of his charge but those of the warmest sympathy and the most unwearied care.  He pontemplates them all as born to immortality, and he feels that he has been commissioned as an instrument for arrest- ing their attention to this exalted birthright, and to guide their feet in the narrow path which conducts to eternal joys. He is impelled, therefore, to activity for their good both by the deepest love for his Savior and the warmest affection for his people. So much absorbed is he in the welfare of his people that he is interested in every event in which they are interested. In their concerns of time, their pians, and in their success, in their individual inter- ests and their social capacity, the "faithful pastor has al- most the same strength of feeling which throbs in their own bosoms.

ZMust he be sacrificed? Ah, what then? Not much. It is but a little thing; let him die. The event will cause a little commotion for a timne; but soon it will be forgotten, and the community in which -he long lived and faithfully and successfully ministered, when he is decently buried, will rise up and call him blessed. Mr. Eldridge endured the trial of separation from his people in such a manner as made the cursory observers re- mark that its effects on his health and spirits were far more slight than they had anticipated. All in the com- munity were fully aware of his sentiments and feelings in re- lation to the pastoral office - that he deemed afluctuating ministry of disastrous consequence both to the clergy and the people. All knew, too, what had been his feelings in relation to his own pastorate; how that from the period  of his ordination, through each successive year of his pas- toral life, he had planned and labored, not only- for im- mediate success, but for ulterior benefits to his people in years to come; that his foundations were so laid as to require, not only the fervor of youth and the energy of manhood, but the experience and wisdom of age, to rear and complete the superstructure, so that those who should come after him might comprehend the happy effects of his min- istry and future generations be partakers of its benefits. By reason of this knowledge, it was feared that, in being arrested in his progress when his plans were but partly   THE EX-PAStOR,       453, executed and his work but partiy comtpleted, he would exhibit some clear signs of sad disappointment and of deep despbndehcy. If such exhibition Was not made to the cur:'-, sory observer, it was because Mr. Eldtidge could controlt is;: ,  emotions and repress the risings of sadness when indivi ".- als were about him whom he did nat care to introduce into  the inner chambers of his soul. It was not because he: was indifferent to the position in which he had been placed, in consequence of being stopped in his pastoral career in the period of life when he was best fitted by knowledge, experience, and wisdom to perform the labor he had reserved for this period bf his ministry; that every individual whom he met did not discover despondency and grief in him. Of this there was abundant' evidence from his intimate friends, who had frequent opportunity for learning the real effects his dismission were producing tipbn him. These traced disappointment, And sadness, and woe id the many expr'essions he made to them of his feelings and in the mournful spectacle which they were compelled to witness of his staggering courage and withering energies. Th intimate friends of Mr. Eldridgeftlt that he teas almost over- come by the rupture of his pastoral relation. They feared that h6 would be completely Unfitted for, further usefulness to the church and the world unless by a change of scenes his thoughts should be diverted froih the parish and the things therewith connected. Accordingly he was perisuaded to enter on a Course of travel, by which he was detained from home some two months, and to his partial benefit. Though in- his absence his sensibilities to what' had lately passed had become somewhat blunted, yet Mr. El- dridge was an unhappy man. His friends made many at- tempts to persuade him to anticipate another settlement and to put himself in a way to invite such a blessing; but to all such kind interpositions for his own good he would reply that he, had once settled for life -had planned, had   A VOICE FROM THE PARSO1NA(GE, executed, with all his wisdom and talents, to be the most useful to the people of his charge, and that his pastoral life had ceased. In process of time, however, he arranged his course to his condition, and was occupied in literary labors, in the care of his lands and trees, and in the occa- siona.l supply of pulpits vacant for a season through the sickness, vacation, or dismission of pastors. It was five months from his dismission before he found himself unoccupied in other pulpits; and thus this length of time passed without his spending a Sabbath at home and appearing in the sacred temple as a parishioner. This was a Sabbath of great trial to him, and, from appearances and expressions, of great trial to the large body of the people. Success had not attended the efforts made by Colonel Presbury and Deacon Smith, who were the com- mittee for supplying the pulpit; and the people were yet hearing candidates. The one who officiated on this oc- casion, though a goodly man and of good reputation, was singularly unfortunate in not securing the special favor of any. Whether his complete unlikeness to Mr. Eldridge, or the rise of impatient or revengeful feelings on the part of those who never desired a change of pastors, produced a general outburst of dissatisfaction among the people as they emerged from the sanctuary in the morning, is not known; but the committee did not deem it advisable to employ him further. Doubtless the presence of Mr. El- dridge excited many to make comparisons much to the prejudice of the man the committee had introduced as a candidate for popular favor and the pastorate. During the period that passed whilst the parish were without a pastor of fifteen months, Mr. Eldridge received many and varied expressions of respect and affection from the largest part of his late charge. These, occurring at intervals, had a happy effect in reviving his spirits and soothing his feelings; but, then, the fact would at last   ascend and overpower these expressions that he was an exile from the people of his first love, and plunge him into despondency and grief at the continued reflection that further opportunity to complete to his mind his ministry was forever cut off. Though he made vigorous attemptS. to rise over such emotions, yet he could not succeed. At his ordination he felt that he was set apart as the minister of the church and parish till death or his own misconduct should remove him; and as neither of these had intervened to end his ministry, he though t he ought still to have con- tinued the recipient of the vows which were made to him at that period by his church love.  It may have been an error in Mr. Eldridge thus to have felt. Doubtless some, without hesitation, will pronounce it so; but if every pastor for the last half century had been inspired with his feelings of the sanctity of the pas- toral relation, and had attached his value to its perma- nency, and had labored as wisely, as variouslyi as abun- dantly as he did to be a minister that need not to be ashamed, he probably might have --been saved from such error, in never being called to the trial from which it sprung. There cannot be a doubt that, under such a min- istry as his for fifty years, our churches and our parishes would never have passed through the rendings and the wranglings which have enfeebled so many and sent a gen- eral reproach upon them all; for public sentiment would undoubtedly have been encouraged by such a ministry in the conviction that the permanent ministry is the most productive of good. Had pastors for the period above mentioned been as deaf to invitations popularly denomi- nated "loud calls" as was Mr. Eldridge, the foundation stones to the permanency of the pastoral relation might not have been disturbed. Had they frowned upon the fickleness of the people as le did upon their caprice, upon their every attempt to disturb those bonds into which they  456     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE.  most solemnly entered with their pastors, and thus nimad it not an easy matter for one or two restless spirits to operate upon the entire mass, and remove, for A slight or no cause, faithful, Useful, and devoted minister, the task of dis- t:e sing a pastor Would not, probably, have been one to be undertaken as a veryfeasibk pfojett. But for the example which almiot every parish around had set of the facility in effecting a change of pastors, Mr. Eldridge would have continued his ministrations to the people over whom he was ordained till his Master took him to his reward in heaven, Both Deacon Smith and Colonel Presbury were well aware how successfully 'men like themselves had uorked in otherplaces who had conceived a prejudice towards faithful pastors; and therefore they were e*- couraged to gratify their own wicked feelings in the imita- tion of the same inglorious precedent. A successor at length was found and settled in the par- ish of wheiI'. Eldridge had long been the successful and useful miSister, To many it Was a matter of great sur- prise that the people should have extended their suffrages thus, when it was known abroad that they had rejected many other candidates of far more promise both from their talents and literary acquisitions. The man of their choice had failed in other smaller parishes to gain a popu- lar vote because he was deemed not sufficiently great and talented to be the means of their prosperity. None' doubted his piety or questioned his sincerity; but there seemed to be the feeling in many places where he -had preached as a candidate that he had not the power de- manded to build up and make flourish a religious Com- nmunity. Howivever, he received the votes of the- people where Mr. Eldriidge had ministered, and was duly com- missioned as their pastor. As was to be expected, the affections of the people began to be intwined avbout the young minister. It was A   THE EX-PASTOR,        457 right and proper that the shepherd should be loved. No one was more ready to encourage such a feeling in all over whom he had any influence than Mr. Eldridge. He himself was well disposed towards his successor, and re- garded him as able to do much good in the service of, is  Lord and Master. Whilst, however, many of the-paraih greatly loved their present minister, Mr. Eldridge had very soon a new trial in the ease with which the former pastor could be put into the shade, and be treated with indignity by those even who had to the very'last period of his connection with them, and even up to the time when a successor was ordained, manifested the greatest love and respect. Whilst he was not expecting nor de- siring to have the affections and respect of the pastor continued to him, yet, as he highly prized theministerial office and had done nothing to mar his X character as one of its incumbents, he was expecting t  spect due a minister of Christ would be awarded 1'1 : hilst this was done always by such characters as DrI: ward, Mr. Clay, and the Davidsons, yet there were others, who had been equal to these in their expressions of respect and affection, who were inclined now to treat him with the equality and rudeness that governed them in their inter- course with those who had ever been Ythe same -level with themselves. They seemed to thin k  to act as if the -dismission of a minister had destroyed hs'finisterial character and left him a layman. By reason of this feeling, manifested by a portion of the people in different ways and on various occasions, Mr. Eldridge was most severely tried. As he had regarded all classes -in the community with extreme interest, and labored abundantly for their good, and been by all acknowledged instrumental of great benefits to them as their minister, he was. expecting that gratitude for past services would prompt to kind -and 39 ,i   458     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. respectful treatment when in the providence of God it Was no longer in his power to minister to them; but in such expectation he was disappointed, and often had to mourn, over the ease with which he could be forgotten, or be treated with indignity and coldness. For this reason he could not in his private capacity do many things which he would for the interest and edification of the commu- nity. He did not wish to expose himself to the incon- siderate animadversions of any, or to take upon himself trusts which a few might wish to have fall upon another. Therefore he preferred to keep himself aloof from a pro- miscuous assembly, and, when not abroad on professional duty, to confine himrself within his own enclosures. Though requested often by some to be present in meetings for con- ference and prayer, he was obliged to deny himself the pleasure and profit of such means of spiritual improve- ment in j   .ce of having heard dor seen how ruth- lessly so'  , werie always at these meetings handled his character an intnerpreted hiss motives. He lamented such a state of feeling towards him, because it deprived him of power to be useful in a private capacity where he had long publicly labored. Another trial: of the ex-pastor had its source in the smallness of^e which was often placed on his official services abrsad. It was knoiwn that Mr. Eldridge was dismissed. Parish committees who had in cha-rge th sup- ply of pulpits vacated by pastors who were enjoying abroad their three and fouri weeks of vacation were awaiie that Mr. Eldridge was dismissed. He was often applied to in these circumstances to supply the vacancy. But in what manneri was the application made? Often after the manner of the one We will now detail. Mr. Eldridge had been at horne on a Monday morning but a few minutes, having spent the previous Sabbath in a   THE EX-PASTOR,        459 neighboring town, where for a few weeks past he had been preaching, when he was visited by a gentleman wha introduced himself as Mr. Crosby. "I suppose our minister has left home to-day," Mr. (ros- by remarked, " to be absent four weeks. When he was settled it was agreed by the parish that be might have four Sabbaths in each year to himself, and that they would supply the pulpit. Many of our people have expressed a desire to hear you preach, Mr. Eldridge ; and I have called to see if you could supply our pulpit the pext Sabbath." "b I have no engagement," Mr. Eldridge replied, "for the next Sabbath; and I think I can accommodate you." "I suppose," Mr. Crosby observed, " that I ought to say that our people don't feel as if they ought to pay two min- isters. They raise for our pastor eight hundred dollars a year ; and many fell that they are already 4x. too muck for his support. We don't expect to obtainiminister to supply Mr. Freeman's place withlout giving a little some- thing; but we can't afford to pay the full price. Could you go under such circumstances?"7 "How much do you propose to give?"Mr. Eldridge in- quired. "Some of us have thought," Mr. Crosby said, "we migh{; raisefour orfive dollars a Sabbath." "That would about meet the expenses of a journey to your place, Mr. Eldridge observed, "I suppose," Mr. Crosby said, "it would cost four or five dollars to go there and back." "Well," said Mr. Eldridge, "I suppose your people are able to raise much mnore than they now do for preaching if they were disposed. I have often passed through your town, and have noticed that you have a large population and a very fine meeting house. Your farms indicate both : wealth and prosperity."   "O     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE. "O, yes, there is considerable wealth in our place, I know," Mr. Crosby remarked; " and, as you intimate, the people are sufficiently able to raise more money for preach- ing than they now do-; but, then, they would not do it." i Do you think it would be just in your people to employ a clergyman to supply their pastor's place while he is ab- sent and not remunerate him for his labor when they have so much ability?" u"Why, no," Mr. Crosby replied. "We expect to pay, as I said, a little something." "But four or five dollars, the sum you named, would only about pay my expenses should I preach for you next Sab- bath. There would be little or nothing leftfor my services,' Mr. Eldridge said. "You would have an opportunity to preach," Mr. Crosbv remarked. "It would not be necessary for you to make any preparation, as you probably have a great many old sermons. !nnisters who are dismissed, I have always' thought, love to preach whenever they canfitd a place." This latter remark very sensibly affected Mr. Eldridge ; but, suppressing his feelings, he observed, -- "' I always am ready to preach the gospel whenever there is a call of Providence for me so to do. I can have op portunity to preach nearer home than your place to a peo- ple who are really unable to afford much compensation ; and, when I have services'to give away, I prefer going there. I should expect to be far more successful in Such a place in doing good than in a community where there is abundant ability, but no disposition to- compensate a minister."' "I have supposed that it was common for parishes situat- ed as we are, when their pastors were away in their vaca- tion, to get their preaching for little or nothing from dismissed ministers," Mr. Crosby said. "That may be, said Mr. Crosby. I fear it is too true; but, then, it is nevertheless very unjust. -Dismissed minis   THE EX-PASTOR.        461 ters usually need all the compensation they can obtain for their services whenever they preach ; for it is from their labors that their families are to be supported, I have always thoug thth th they should be i  lly compensated whenever they were called upon' to preach. It has ev'er been my practice to pay a brother minister who supplied my place il my absence the ful price. A dismissed ministe9 can no better afford to give away his services than a pas- tor. The people in Bedford parish set a very good exam- ple to other communities in the matter of paying clergymen who supply the place of the pastor in his vacation." "What is that?"Mr. Crosby inquired. "I lately saw a minister, who had been supplying that people whilst the pastor was relaxing himself abroad in his vacation, who informed me that they gave their minis- ter seven hundle d dollars a year and the privilege of being absent four Sabbaths. They considered these four Sab- baths in which he was absent as imnportant as any other four Sabbaths; and they usually paid the individuals who sup- plied the vacancy each Sabbath ini pqloportion to the salary of the pastor. 'We do so,' the good deacon of the church remarked,' because it is, in the first place, right; and, in the next place, .from respect to our pastor. If w e should beg our preaching or but half pay for it,' he said, ' for four Sabbaths every year when our pastor is absent, he would think we did not value his vacation much. Now, he knows that his salary is in reality equal to seven hundred and fifty dollars a year; for it costs us about fifty dollars to pay for his four Sabbaths in which he is away.' " "Well, Mr. Eldridge," Mr. Crosby remarked, "if you will come and preach for us next Sabbath you shall have ten or twelve dollars, if I have to pay it all myself." In the course of a few days after the above conversation Mr. Eldridge received a visit from a friend from abroad 39*            -   "2     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE, with whom he had been in most friendly correspondence for years. Though a layman, yet he was interested in-the condition of the clergy, and on various occasions had evinced this interest much to the relief and encouragement of this most important class of the community. Whilst he was the guest of Mr. Eldridge a variety of subjects were introduced, as well those of a general nature as of per- sBnal interest. From some inquiries made of-herhusband by Mrs. Eldridge relative to the interview he had lately had with Mr. Crosby above, alluded to, and the facetious replies of Mr. Eldridge, the curiosity of Mr. Lawrence was awakened, to satisfy which it became necessary that the character of the conversation be described. This being done, Mr. Lawrence remarked, with deep emo- tion, - "M y feelings have often been severely tried at the man- ner in which the services of dismissed ministers are often treated. Many people seem to suppose that they can ob- taid them, when they are not particularly engaged, to preach a Sabbath for little or no compensation, and that then they are rather conferring than receiving a favor in asking them to preach." "I have felt very differently since I was dismissed," Mr. Eldridge said, "in relation to this subject from what I ever did before, probably for the reason that I have known more about it than formerly." "I have a neighbor at home who is a clergyman,' Mr. Lawrence remarked, " who was dismissed on account of ill health a year or two since, and from him I have learned much of the manner in which people are disposed some- times to treat the poor minister. I never heard him com- plain with any degree of censure, but rather he always alluded to the subject with sorrow; for he is a most ex- cellent man, and one to whom our people have become much attached. He has told me that he has often been   THE EX-PASTOI       . 463 called upon to supply the pulpits of parishes where there was a vacancy for one or two Sabbaths, occasioned by the absence of the pastors, when he was requited with nothing more than the sum necessary to cover his expenses, as the same were ascertained by the parish committee, whose duty it was in behalf of the parish to give full compensa- tion; for the pastor had the right of absence. On one occasion he said he was asked how much he would have to pay for his horse and carriage; and the sum being one dollar and seventy-five cents, the committee man asked him, on handing him a two-dollar bank bill, if he could give him back the remaining quarter, as it was impossible for "m to mnake change." "Why did lhe not demand full compensation," Mr. E1- dridge inquired," if the service was rendered in accordance with the request of the committee, and if it belonged to the par, and not to the pastor, to make compensa- tion?" "He is a very modest man,;"Mr. Crosby replied, " and trustful, and is disposed to receive wliat is bestowed rather than to make a demand for what is justly his due." "I cannot think that there are many parishes who would be guilty of such mean injustice," Mr.. Eldridge remarked. "There are some, however, who practise in this way, I am persuaded," Mr. Crosby said ; " and you ministers, too," he continued with a smile, "sometimes do-the thing in rela- tion to a dismissed brother which is not altogether right." "What do you refer to?" inquired Mr. Eldridge. "I have heard," Mr. Lawrence replied, " upon authority which I consider unquestionable, that sometimes pastors have found it for their interest to be absent fromt-their people on a Sabbath, and that, to supply their pulpit, they have sought a dismissed minister who had no other source of supporting a family but preaching, and have not been very liberal ia their compensation."   "4     A VOICE FRO0M TIlE PARSONAGE. "So far as my knowledge extends," Mr. Eldridge re- marked, "I have found in pastors who were settled strong sympathy towards their brethren who were without pas- toral charge and a readiness to aid them in every way in their power. I have known of many instances where pas- tors have sought the aid of such brethren when they have been sick or absent from their people, and have- paid them the full price for their services. Nevertheless, if may be that what you intimate is correct. I have never happened to know of any instances of illiberality in pastors towards those whom they employed to supply their place in the pulpit."  "Perhaps I have been in a better situation for hearing about these matters than yourself," Mr. Lawrence said. "At anlly rate, I have learned some pretty hard stories on this subject." "What are some of them?"Mr. Eldridge asked. "To be fair," Mr. Lawrence replied, "I must state that I have known of great liberality on .the part of some pas- tors to the brethren who have preached for them in their absence. I hope contrary instances are rare, but I am afraid that they might be more uncommon. Not long ago there was a pastor who thought he might be more eligibly settled and who took some considerable pains to effect a change of condition. He would seek an invitation to. preach a Sabbath in some large and popular parish where they were in want of a pastor, and would- supply his own pulpit with the services of a brother in the neighborhood who had been dismissed, giving him six dollars per Sabbath, and receiving from the destitute parishfifteen. Now, what do you mnake of such conduct? ' "'If that is t Mrue," Mr. Eldridge said, "I most sincerely regret it." "There is no doubt of its correctness ; for I happened to hear of the case through the brother who supplied this   THE EX-PASTOR.        465 pastor, and he knew how much this destitute parish paid the individual whom he supplied ; for he was soon after called there to preach himnself, and was informed by the parish com- mittee. I have heard of several similar cases." "It maybe," Mr. -Eldridge said, ",that I shall yet know more on this subject. Since I have been dismissed I have learned some things which I did not before know, and it may be that I shall have some experience myself. I may be called to supply the place of some brother who will give me a third of what he receives." "I have an instance in mind," Mr. Lawrence said, "which greatly puts, in the shade this last case I men- tioned. In our state, a clergyman who was settled over a large congregation was sent by the people a representa- tive to the legislature. He received for his services there fourteen dollars a week. Sometimes he would preach at home and sometimes he would exchange. Sometimes he would be called upon to preach in some of the towns near where the legislature met when they were destitute of a pastor, and receive ten or tweve dollars; and then he would send to his own people a brother to whom he would give five dollars. I have heard a poor minister, with a large family dependent upon him, tell me that he had five dollars for supplying the pulpit of this indi- vidual, when he, the very week, was receiving for his ser- vices in the legislatureand for supporting a destitute pulpit twenty-six dollars, which, added to his regular salary at home, would amount to' about thirty-eight dollars. Now, what do you think of this?" Mr. Eldridge found another embarrassing trial as an ex-pastor in his relation to his successor. He was aware of the adage, almost as ancient as the practice of chan- ging pastors, that "Dismissed ministers make poor parish- ioners ;"' but he always regarded it as a slanderous impu-   "6     A: VOICE. FROT THrE PAR sNAsGr,. tation, without good foundation. He saw no reason why an individual who had filled the pastoral office should in private life be in the least detrimental to the reputation, comfort, success, or usefulness of the regular pastor. On the contrary, many considerations were suggested to his mind whereby he was induced to believe the ex-pastor might be of great advantage in every way to his successor or to the minister of the place in which he resided. An ex-pastor knows the trials of the ministry, and is largely in experience of the many ways of disposing of difficult and embarrassing circumstances which are continually oc- curring, in the history of the pastor to give him heavy trial and great perplexity. By reason of this knowledge he is qualified to impart important aid in seasons of diffi- culty, and his own sympathetic disposition would prompt him to render such aid in the hour when it might be needed. Mr. Eldridge early determined that he would thus assist his successor and be unto him a true friend and counsellor. There was- nothing in his soul to persuade him to a contrary course ; for he was interested in the peo- pie of his late care, and was favorably inclined towards their present minister. He neither allowed any censure to es- cape his own lips upon any conduct of his successor, nor would he hear such censure, Without rebuke, from others. In a variety of ways he endeavored to smooth the path of his successor and to make all things move on easily and for good. Yet he soon perceived that ]his efforts were not ap- preciated, and at length had unmistakable evidence that there was no disposition on the part of the individual whose true usefulness and happiness he was consulting to recipro- cate friendly attentions. Rumor brought to him the irtel- ligence that he was regarded by his successor with jealousy, and contemplated more like an enemy than a friend; and this was strengthened by, the demeanor of the successor. The little courtesies in the power of one minister to show   THRi ESX-PASTO R      t467 anothe' were intermitted, and there were formality and coldness in the manner of the successor whenever he met the man who had preceded him in the pastoral office. Mr. Eldridge Was at length treated by him more like an offended parishioner than a true friend and brother minis- ter. It was a long period before he could understand the reason of this treatment; but the mystery was at length removed in a conversation Mr. Eldridge had with a neigh- boring minister, Mr. Waldo, who called upon him in the expression of kindness and friendship which for years had been unabated. "I have been lecturing your successor a little this after- noon," Mr. Waldo observed. "Ah," replied Mr. Eldridge; "pray tell me what he has been doing to provoke your fatherly rebukes." "I was not at all pleased with the manner in which he talked about you," Mr. Waldo said. "From his conversation I judged that he looked upon you rather as an enemy than a friend." "He- is very much deceived if he considers me an ene- my," Mr. Eldridge said. "Yes, I told him so," Mr. Waldo remarked. "I told him he had no more sincere friend or well wisher in the parish than Mr. -Eldridge. I asked him for the least evi- dence to sustain his position; but he could not present any; he said he had nothing tangible. I asked him if he had treated you as a friend; as one in whom he had confi- dence. He replied that he had endeavored to treat you with respect, but that he had never considered you among his particular friends. Heremarked that he had always heard that dismissed ministers made poor parishioners; and he determined from the first to be on the lookout for JMr. Eldridge, and not suffer him to get the advantage of him. The last expression unravelled to my mind the whole mat- ter, and- excited my ihdignation and sorrow. I told him H . .   "8     A VOICE PROM THE PARSONA6E. that I knew you well, and that I knew that you would do him all the good it were in- your power to render him. His attitude, ' being on the lookout,' had made the entire diffi culty. 'Now,' said I, 'I will tell you how I treat dis- missed ministers. I have two in my parish, and they are among my best friends. I call upon them often. I un- bosom myself to them. I sympathize with them and en- deavor to aid them. I treat them as ministers. I ask thetn to preach occasionally, and among my people I al. ways speak well of them and encourage the people to treat them with kindness and respect. I have never had any difficulty from their being in the parish, and I never expect any unless I nmake it.' I told him that I believed three fourths of the trouble from ndismissed ministers arose from the pastors themselves, from their suspicions from their being on the lookout for them. Would pastors treat their breth- ren who happen to move into their parishes with kindness, and as ministers, I do not believe there would be much trouble from them as parishioners." "You have expressed my sentiments," Mr. Eldridge remarked. "I am of the opinion that, were pastors to act the part of friends at all times to their brethren who hap- pen to be their parishioners, and treat them as ministers and brethren, they would find it both for their usefulness and happiness." "I advised our good brother to alter in his feelings and course towards you," Mr. Waldo said, " and assured him that he would most certainly find his reward." "I should be very happy to have him more cordial," Mr. Eldridge said; ' and I really think, if he became well acquainted with me, that he would discover that he had made a mistake." Two years passed away in the life of Mr. Eldridge as an ex-pastor. Whilst he was always well employed, either   T"IE }X-PASTOR.        469 :in the preparation of articles of sterling value for our lit- erary and theological reviews or in preaching the gospel to some destitute people, yet he continued to sigh and to lament over the interruption of his pastoral duties and the disarrangement of the plans he had formed at the beginning of his profession --a career for making his ministerial lfe as complete and useful as possible. Efforts were frequently made, both by his ministerial and other friends, to have him look out for another pastorate; but to them all he turned a deaf ear. He had been once settled, and that for life, and his sensibilities would, not suffer him to settle again ; for he was satisfied that he could not be useful, af- ter his own ideal of usefulness, to another people. How- ever, so many werekthe embarrassments attending his life as an ex-pastor that he finally consented to entertain the plan of a connection with a literary institution which some of his friends were maturing. In process of time he was elected a professor in one of our western colleges; and, af- ter much anxious suspense, he accepted the appointment. Now a new trial came. Through legacies of relations he had been enabled to purchase a well-built and beauti- ful -house, to which were attached about twenty acres of land in the highest degree productive. He made this purchase when all things in his parish favored the conclusion that he would not need any other house or home than this. He had expended much treasure in the improvement of his lands. Trees of various kinds were on its hills and in its valleys, and on its plains were seen the tall and waving grass in its season, being evidence that a skilful, and prac- tical, and industrious hand had correctly prepared the soil for such a goodly return of crops. The garden, too, and the large er Closure around the house, had signally changed aspects sinwce they had been in the occupancy of Mr. El- dridge, exhibiting the most pleasing beauty as well as af- fording many substantial comforts. Amidst the shrubbery 40   470     A VOICE FROM THE PARSONAGE.- and under the trees which his own hands had planted his sons and daughters had gambolled and played;, and, whilst he had seen them thus employed, he had often thought that, whilst he lived, they would never know another father's house. But now house and lands were to be sold, to prepare the way for a removal to a distant home. Af- ter refusing one and another offer as being far too small, Mr. Eldridge at last succeeded in disposing of his estate, but at a sacrifice of over a thousand dollars. Soon after he and his family were settled at the west he at once entered on his new duties as professor. Here, however, he was not happy, nor were his family contented. He was not busy, after his strong desire, in searching the Scriptures and bringing forth the beaten oil for'the sanctuary, for the edification and salvation of the people of his charge. At the circumstances which interrupted this his chosen labor he would often halt and over them would he in sadness muse. He could not recover himself from this most melan- choly retrospection ; and at last he fell a victim to disease, superinduced, in the opinion of medical advisers, by grief and despondency. He thus fell after a residence of a little more than a year in his new home, to the grief of many friends who had learned his worth in the short period of their acquaintance with the man. But for his dismission from a people among whom he had been signally useful, through th4e crafty perseverance of one or two individuals in operating to his hurt till the many be- lieved expediency demanded his removal, Mr. Eldridge, to all probability, would have continued till old age or death gathering stars for the crown of his rejoicing forever amidst the people of his frst and only love.
