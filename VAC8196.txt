Very few novels have y~.t been written which combine more perfectly            )
than this does the exciting interest of a Sea Romance with the more
quiet and heart-touching incidents of Domestic Life. Althou~Ih
the Author prefers for the present to withhold his name from the pub-
lie he is destined, we venture to say, to take a high position among
the Romance writers of the present day. Many of the Sea Scenes
will remind the critical reader of some of Cooper's best productions,
while other portions-those of a pathetic nature-are scarcely exceeded
by Dickens huinseif. CONTENTS;

JACK WAID, TH~ BURGLAR,

TIJIE COBBLER OF GOTIIAM.
Intelligent readers uf the present day cannot have failed to observe, the sameness and
uniformity Qf'Ta9d~Tn ~ctinns, and they wili l~e refresh9dby meeting with a work entirely
orl~inal, which this i.. We all remember the shuddering sensations with which we turned
the pages of "The Three Spaniqrds" in ,ur .youthful days; how we were led on from
mystery to mystery, until our very souls were absorbed in terror; how crime and dark in-
trigues were interwuveu through the whole plot; how gloomy forests and old castles lent
ap~slling interest to late~sity of description, and t~se entire story impressed itself upon our
imagination~ so thoromighly, that we were actors as it were in the drama ourselves. Such
power and vividness hate we in the present work! No one who peruses "Jack Waid, or
The Cobbler of Gotham," wiU rise from it with anything but thrilling sensations, nor will
the story ever be effaced frtm his memory, but live on with him through after years, and be
a fact, so to speak, iu his existence. Some idea of the characters, and the plot 'f the story,

CHAPTER I.
T~n SERPENT 1?J TH~ Gaiss.
It was in the year 18-, and the scene in
a lower apartment of a fine old mansion that
stood on a gentle knoll that overlooked the
clear sparkling waters of the Schuylkill
river.
The room was superbly furnished in accor*
dance with the fashion of the time, which,
if it yielded to the sumpt~iousness of modern
luxury, made amends in i(s substantial and
massive richness.

On an embroidered couch, beneath the
rich hangings of the window, thrq~igh which
stole the soft Eephyrs of a summer evening,
a young and lovely womaa reclined. Her
dress was simple, but costly, and was s~dmi.
rably adapted to heighten, if that indeed
were possible, the matchless graces and
symmetry of her figure. Her features were
exquisitely chiselled, though it was plain to
be seen, that years had not yet matured her
singular beauty.
The attitude of the fair girl-for though.
wedded she seemed no more-was one of
thoughtfulness arid dejection. Tears stoo4
in her large blue eyes, but ere the jewelled
drops fell from her fringi~~lids, she wiped
them away, andlooking out upon the garden,

O


8                       THE BLU:
the fresh balmy air toyed with her silken
locks and fanned her lily-like forehead.
Presently the door suddenly opened,
and ere the lady had time to rise fr im her
recumbent position on the couch, a nobles
lo~dng young man enteredd and cast his eyes
around the apartment.
Quickly perceiving that he had intruded
upon the privacy of a lady's boudoir, he
drew back, and with a profound obeisance re-
marked
"I crave your pardon, madam, for having
ventured here unannounced. I was inform-
ed, by the servant, that I should fln'd Mr.
Walsingham within."
"He is not here, Mr. Thornton; but,
doubtless, is in the library, the room adjoin-
ing on tha right."
"Thank you, madam," replied the. young
gentleman, and, he retreated backward
from the room.
Scarcely had he done soA and closed the
door after him, when a side panel was with-
drawn, and an elderly man, of athletic per-
s6a and strongly marked features, entered the
room. It was Harvey Walsiugham, the
older of the three brothers of the veteran
merchants of that name. He was no~ the
sole successor in the business of his father,
whose extreme, old age had induced him,
several years previous, to retire from the
active scenes of commercial life. The junior
Walsiugham was himself now in his fiftieth
year, and hnd remained a bachelor until only
a few month~f the time of wlmich we now
write.
flis step 'was haughty; his countenance
wore an habitual expression of sternuess ; his
movements abrupt; his voice harsh; but in
his general aspect there was a certain dignity
inseparable from the habit of commanding;
and a courtesy not devoid of grace, that when
he choose, could secure affection as well as
respect. When the iron will and the majesty
of physical strength can bow to the loveli-
ness of woman-the enchantress is usually
more proud of her conquest than when she

E BEARDS
has subdued only intellectual power. It was
with this pride that Mary Walton loved
Harvey Walsiugham, and accepted him as
her husband and friend.
"Who left here, but now, Mary 7" inquired
the husband somewhat abruptly. "I thought
I heard some one speak, and the tread of
steps, as I entered."
"Yes, Mr. Thornton was here in search
of you," replied the young wife.
"ThorntQn I" repeated Wal,~ingham, bend.
ing his keen eyes on his wife, who looked up
into his face with loving confidence. He
added quickly: "You h~ive been weeping,
Mary! Has Augustus Thornton, my account-
taut, seen the wife of his employer in tears."
"Nay, Walsinghani," said the young wife
softly, casting down her eyes. "I was think-
ing of my dear mother and my earliest home,
and I could not but give vent to my feelings
at the moment you entered, my husband."
"Always pining afterhome," muttered the
iron man, impatiently, "Can not my love
and wealth supply the place of your parents
and their humble home? Really, I begin to
weary of this childish fretfulness and per-
verseness, Mary, I would have you under-
stand."
"Be not offended with me, my dear hus-
band," whispered his beautiful spouse, throw-
ing her fair arms around his neck, and lean-
ing her head or his breast. "Be not angry
with me. It is but iiatural that I should
grieve when I rernenher the scenes of child-
hood and the fond crossings of my loving
and beloved parents.~~
"Mary," said the merchant, sternly, though
h~ pcrmittted and returned the caresses of
his wife, "Mary, deem me not selfish or cx.
acting. Your parents have other children
who remain with them to cherish ~nd com-
fort them in their declining years and infir-
mities Not ~o with me. My father is very
aged, and past the years of social companion-
ship. I have therefore only you to lo-~k to,
to bring me solace and joy, amid all the anx-
ieties and turmoil of the plodding business

world. Yet I have long since realized that
omit feelings are incongenial and thai my
deep absorbing love for you has from first to
to last, been but cold and indifferentlyre-
paid."
"You are cruel to doubt my love for you,
Walsingiiam. You have all my affection,
save that which the instincts of my nature will
have me reserve for the loved ones who gave
me life and being.~~
"Nay, Mary, I did not doubt your love for
me to the full extent your naturally' cold
temperament will allow. But it is not the
kind of sympathy and love I Something
more ardent and burning, would more befit
the impassioned impulses of my bosom.-
But, after all, Mary, you are not to blame.
Mine is a wayward heart, and it will need
all your tenderness and the best strength of
my own philosophy to bring pence and hap-
piness to my soul."
Theconversation between the husband and
wife, was interrupted by a servant knocking
at the door, and bringing a letter to the man-
tsr. It seemed to be on matters~of weighty
mo~ment. His brow became flushed, and then
pale, as he read its contents. Mary watched
his countenance with eager anxiety. Die-
missing the man who brought the letter, by
a sign, Walsiaghani turned to his wife.
"It is even worse than I thought, Mary-
Nothing but disaster on disaster. Another
ship lost, with her rich cargo, from Lyons.-
A few more such losses and I shall be ruined
for ever. I am called to New York, with a
view of a settlement of salvage, and ~nust
leave this very evening. The coaches leave
at nine. Ah, again in tears I But cheer up,
Mary-your tears only serve to forbocle fur-
ther troubles and perils. Take a turn in the
garden, and n~eet me here presently, prior
to my departure on this pressing business."
Walsingham sought the apartment of his
aged father~and remained closeted with him
for some considerable time.
M~antimehis wifesummoninglda Walton,

own age, who happened to make a visit of
afew weeks to the Walsiugham mansion, they
both descended to the garden, andsocui steod
before a natural arbor, formed by interlacing
boughs, over which crept many vin~e laden
with golden and crimson flowers,
A picture which there presented ttsel4 e~r-
rested the attention of Mary. She touched
the arm of her cousin, i~nd they approached
softly nearer.
A boy of twelve years of age, of uncom-
mon beautywas seatedon the ground, writ-
ing in a small portfolio or album.
His face was fair as that of a girl's, but
shaded now by the long clustering golden
locks, which floated in rich profession about
his brow and over his shoulders. As, at in-
tervals, in the ecstasy of his eom~osition,
he raised his dark flashing eyes upwards,
with a wrapt expression. on his suuw-whitQ
brow, he might have formed the sculptor's
model for the young Genius of Poetry.
Mary Walsingha~i gazed admiringly a few
moments upon her young nephew, for such
he was, the only son of her husband's bro-
ther Louis, and now an orphan, beneath the
roof of his grandfather and uncle Harvey.-
Approaching him unperceived, Mary laid her
han~ on his head, and in a voice of playful
sweetness, said
"Ah, invoking the Muses, I perceive, my
nephew Conradin?"
The boy started up, let fall his pencil and
blushed deeply, but recovering instantly
from his embarrassment, he answered:-
"Yes, dear Aunt, I was trying to write a
little ode to Spring, butthough I know I have
poetry within me, I cannot now utter what I
"Time will give you suitable language for
your thoughts," said his Aunt, smiling and
aftectionately caressing him. You are yet too
young, my ~Jonradin, to trouble your brain
with attempts at poetry."
"Oh, no, dear Aunt. You know lam now
more than twelve years oldand that is not
too young to be a poet, I should think. See,

here Is a whole book full of my verses, and
if you will not laugh at them, you may see
my portfolio, Aunt Mary."
"That's a good dear nephew. Oh, no~ I
will nOt laugh at them; I have no doubtthe
efl'usions ai~e all quite clever, indeed, Conra-
din."
"Well, then~ take the book; but I will not
stay and ha4e ~ou langli at my silly love
pieces."
~[e bounded tl*ay ashe' spoke.
"Hc it a noble youth," said Mary~ to her
cousin Ida.' "Misfottune has early ripened
bit years; bat I fear his pfrcOi~ieiotIs intellect
is beginning to tell disastrou~ly o~ hit physi
cal powers."
"Yes; he is growing just 'like his poor
brother; apd perhaps a similar tvil destiny
awaits him."
Mary read torah of the verses, and praising
the genius of her young relative, gave the
manuteript volume to Ida, and returned to
the house to await the parting interview with
her husband.
Ida penetrated deeperinto the embowering
shades, and presently reached a spot where
a white marble fouatain gleamed amid the
emerald foliage, and shot up a crystal column
t1~water, Which fell again in refreshing sprays
on the shrubbery around. Here she flung
herself okra rustic seat, covered her face With
her hands, and became absorved in a reverie
eta prolonged and pai~fril character.
At length ahestrove to calm her agitatiQn
and wiped away Some tear-drops that had ga.
there in her eyes.
Preaentlya footstep Was heas-d, in the walk
among the' trees. She started up, suddenly,
and met the gaze ofAgustus Thornton. Her
countenance grew'pale as death and the next
instant was suffused with crimson.
Thornton seemed deeply abstracted, and
did not notice the agitation of Ida. Bowing
coldly to her, without speaking, he was pas-
sing along.
"Hold, Augustus! A sword with you, if
you please," exclaimed the young woman.

ly inquired.
"What is your pleasure, Miss Walton I"
Like an ice~boltto the maiden's he~t, were
those few chilling words of Thornton. A
tremorrtrn through her frame, and the blood
forsook her cheek.
"NothAig-nothing!" And motioning
him to leave her, retreating backward, she
sunk again upon the rustic acat.
Thornton approached her, not knowing
what to make of' the lady's singular beha-
vior.
~'What is the matter?" he asked, alarmed.
"Has anything happened-.happencd to
U No! eo I leave me-begone," cried Ida,
vehemently.
"Nay madam. You do not seem to be
well. Permit me to assist you to the house."
"I require not yourkassistance. Your fur-
ther presence isd~tnst~ul; leave me, Isay."
Thornton could only obey her command,
wondering what to make of the singular cir-
cumstance. He had never spoken a word to
her before in his life, and was perplexed to
know whether she labored under some tem-
porary spell' of insanity. He however, in-
stantly resolved to enter the mansion, and
direct some of'the female domestics to go to
the assistance of the poor demented creattire,
if such she really was.
"Has it come to that?" murmured Ida,
bitterly, assoonas Thoratonhad dissippeared.
"He was a. anxiety for her safety. I see it
all now; I am nothing in his eyes. 'I' am
worth only icy w~~rds; but my cousin Mary,
he loves as-nh-he should noel Does the
return his love? Oh, God! Madness!
Madness! I will not think of that-think
of that!"
Starting up, and concealing her face in her
scarf, the unhappy girl promptly sought the
seclusion of her own apartment.~

to the drawing-room, in search of'Conradin,
where she was informed by a servant that
he had gone out with her, cousin Ida, on
an evening visit to one of the neighbors-
Scarcely, however, had she left her chasm-
her, ere the tall figure of a man closely dis-
guised, stole from beneath the drapery of
7 the sleeping couch, and passed out cf the
apartment, muttering as he went-
"The stratagem works admirably! The
poor silly turtle-dove shall not now escape
the fowler's snare I"
"And I will thwart &amp;Ioa both! I will
speal~ daggers t~o his heart, and infamy shall
blast her fame for ever I"
This enigmatical language was pronoun-
ced by another figure, having the semblance
of a young female, of medium height, also
closely disguised, who followed quickly in
the steps of the first intruder who had just
quitted the boudoir of that fair young wife.
Mary again returned to her chamber,
threw herself into a large rocking-chair, and
awaited patiently for the hour of interview
with Thornton.
But time passed by on leaden wings.
Drowsiness overcame her senses. The pop-
pies of Nox were placed to her eye-lids, and
she slept-as purity may ever sleep-calmly
and sweetly, whatever the phantoms and ter-
rors of the nocturnal season.
When she awoke from that long and
blessed slumber, the sun was already up and
shedding its rich golden tints over the face
of nature. The birds among the trees of the
garden were singing their matin hymns,
while the zephyra of morning were laden
with the fragrance gathered from the many
thousand sweet dew-bathed flowers that
bloomed around.
She instantly remembered the proposed
assignation with Thornton, and though it
was broad daylight, she hastened to the ar-
bor that had been designated, not indeed
with the expectation of meeting him, but
pith some vague idea she would there find

her coming.
She walked swiftly along, brushing the
dew-gems from the grass and flowers as she
passed. to the place of rendezvous. The
snowy shafts of the fountain presently
shot up among the green shrubbery, and she
beheld with pleasure the liquid crystal that

basin of the fountain. due bound more and
she had entered the garlanded retreat of the

#Ohhorror of horror! the sight that greets

man blood on the floor of the arbor, and all
around traces of a desperate encounter be.
tween a number of individuals. The egl~n~
tines and honey-suckles lay trailing in blood
and dust. The lattice work of one side of
the arbor was completely torn away, and
there was a trail as if some heavy body had
been dragged through thegrass, over a bed of
violets and along the graveled walks for the
distance of fifty yards to the water's edge of
the Schuylkill, when all traces of the vio-
Ignee in this direction were lost.
Mary uttered a wild scream of alarm? ned
fleeing to the house, fell into a terrible se-
ries of convulsions, wl~ich rendered her un~
conscious of all that transpired for several
weeks afterwards.
Meanwhile the report of the terrible and
mysterious tragedy was carried fair and
near, and led to a thorough search of the
premises for some clue to i~s enactment. A
fragment of. a man's eoat-the hood and
scarf of a female--and a large dh-k ktiife
crimsoned with gore-were picked up among
the grass and flowers, but no human body

coat was identified as a fragment of one

Tan MInw~Fs.-Trn1 MYsTunmous BIRTH.
NEAR the corner of Front and Dock streets
stands a two-storied brick house, painted
yellow, which was once the residriura of a
well-known Swede, and built by him more
than a century ago. At the time of which
we, now write, it was occupied by an elderly
Irish woman, ~hc worthy widow Cathicen
O'Harra, and her daughter Norah, a
sprightly, intelligent and rather pretty erca-
tt~re, just passing from girlhood to womanly
~xisaturity. The lower part of the house was
used as a fruit and herb shop, which was al-
tcrna~ely attended by the widow and her
si~pghter, or, more correctly speaking, gener-
~y by the young girl, since the mother was
4qqently.ealled from home, to officiate both

CHAPTER IV.
DESOLATION-TUE HAUNTED Housn.
Fifteen years had passed since the night
of the tragic horrors-in the garden of the
merchant Walaingham, without further clue
having been obtained in elucidation of their
terrible mysteries.
The lovely girl Ida Walton, and Thornton
and Walsingham, all disappeared on that
occasion, and nothing had ever been revealed
to give positive assurance of either the death
or survival of the whole, or any one or more
0f the parties.
The supposition, however, generally pre-
vailed that Ida aid Walsiugham had both

Ida, mistaken her for his wife, and Thorn-
ton in the arbor at the midnight hour, and
sacrificed them both in the wild phrenzy of
his jealousy and revenge. This preparation
for a departure to a distant city on business
was thought to be a ruse, the better to ena-
ble him to watch the conduct of his wife and
Thornton, both of whom he had, for s~n~e
cause or other, learned to diatrust. This
opinion was strengthened when it became
known that the ships supposed to have been
lost had arrived safely in the harbor of New
York.
Yet he might have fallen in death by the
hands of ThorntOn, in the reneontr~ of the

vent a reply-squeezed his arm in her's

along in the direction of the theatre.
In less than ten minutes the lovers are
comfortably see~ted in the front of the second
tier of boxes. Here Balty took a further
supply of candy, together with a pint of pea-
nuts and several big apples from his hat
and dropped them into Sally's lap; after

The overture is over. The whistling, y~l-
hugs, crying out of "Boots ~ stamp-

ing and the rise of the curtain. All eyes are
on the stage, and all attention fixed on the
soul absorbing drama. Of this immortal
play, it were ~eedless for uS now to speak-
further than to say that on the present occa-
sion, it was appreciated in tb~ highest de-
gree by Baltyand Sally, and the rest of the
audience, until an unexpected occurrence
took place, which suspended Balty'~ voci-
ferous applause and rather ruffled his tens.
per for the rest of the evening~ It was this.
At the close of the first act, the dcor of
the box in which the lovers were seated wa~
opened, and a strange gentleman, of' foreign
appearance, entered, and crowded himselt'
into the pew immediately in the ~r of
where Sally sat. Now this alone was not an
uncommon o' startling circumstance-e~ii
when coupled with the facts that the strai~ga'
gentleman had a large bushy moustache of
extreme stiffness, green spectacles, and a
long cadaverous face overshadowed by a pro-
fuaion of long hair; but when this strange
gentleman met the casual glance of Mhi
Sally Bulser, and returned the same with a
smack of his lips and a significant wink, the
blood of Balty was up to near fever heat on
the instant.
Possibly Sally had not deserved such im-
pertinent, not to say solucious attention.-


24

THE BLIJE BEARDS

Possibly she had. Sure it is, at the expira-
tion of less than five minutes, Sally felt con-
utrained tt~1oQk round again. Balty watched
her movements, and turned round his eyes
also, and caught the foreigner linking and
smacking his lips again at Sally\
"Say, old hos~ I" interfered Ba y; "Gin
us none of your 'pertinence, or I'll lamm yer
right off the reel, see if I don't."
The strange gentleman gased at him wth
a vacant stare, gros~ned 'i~io1ently. dived his
hands into the bottom of his snuff~colored
surtout, brought up a brass tobacco-box, and
with a most condescending air of patronage,
presented it to the indignant apprentice
butcher 1n4.
"Hell 1d'ye think iwan'tbaeco," exclaim.
cd Balty, "don't know english, I s'pose See
here-" and he4elegraphed Miss Sally with
his finger-?"None of your cheek here I D'ye
understand ?"
The strange gentleman opened his mouth,
tapped with. his fore finger on the bridge 'of
his large aquiline nose, ~winked again, and
held forth his snuff-box to Miss Sally Bulser.
The young lady went spontaneously to a
fi~t of laughter; but Baltywas speechless with
indignation; while the strange gentleman
looked inexpressibly delighted.
Fortunately, further colloquy was inter-
rupted, by the curtain rising f~.r the second
act of th~ drama, leaving Balty now no other
alternative but to "cuss" internally, which
he most decidedlydid. .His attention could no

ner, and his eyes. frequently turned threat-
eningly upon the strange gentleman.
At length he detected him devouring in a
ravenous manner, a large apple, just like one
of those he had placed in ~ally's lap. He,'
darted an Othello-like look at his girl Her
face was red----very red, certainly-yet her
attention certainly seemed entirely fixed on
the play.
"Say Sal"-whispered he, "Did you gin's
Sally gave him an energetic push, and cx-
claime4 impatiently, "Shut up, do"

Balty did as he was commanded, it but
was plain to be seen, he but nursed his wrath
to keep it warm, till the end of the act. At
length the curtain fell, and the explanation
came,
"Don't kick up a mussy Balty, and I'll
tell yer. Promise ?"
"Well, I won't," said Balty, hissing out
the word between his clenched teeth.~-.
"Now-"
Why, he put ~iis hand over and took the
apple out of my lap. I didn't see him done

"Put his hands, into your lap! I'lls-
"Oh hush up Balty. See, I don't think

This was true. The strange gentleman

over.

on the pavement outside. The strange gen-

addressed her

ing and producing other delicate articles of
costume, which were privately disposed of by
the mother at one of the principal fancy
stores of the town. Of course, as might be
imagined from the outline we have given of
the family, Mrs. Temple was in fact, and ne-
cessarily so, the ruling spirit of the house,
and seemingly kept every thing in admirable
order in and about the household of which
she was now the acknowledged head and
mistress.

evolved in the singular circumstances of crime
'and horror that ~rexnains to be developed in
our veritable narrative. This 4yas a family
by the name of La Rue, who resided in Se.
cond Street, just below Race. David La Rue
was a native of France, and now pursued the
business of jeweler, and was reported very
wealthy. This family consisted only of La
Rue, his wife, and Antoine, a son, now a
young man of about twenty-three years of
age.
The elder La Rue possessed two very
strong passions-the one to amass wealth'
and the other to witness his son, as he often
termed it, shine a star of the first magnitude.
He would work day and night to accumulate
riches, but made no stint of lavishing it upon
this hopeful heir Antoine-a paradox which
often presents itself among men of this na-
ture.
Among the fashionable traits which the
younger La Rue possessed was that of gain.
hUng. He was' considered a fat pigeon by
the gentlemen of this fraternity, atid though
he often got quite unmercifully picked, his
purse was readily ieplenished from the cof-
fers of his indulgent father, so that such things
as pecuniary losses never disturbed the ecjuan.
unity of his temper. In a word, to finish the
character of young La Rue, he wa~ thorough-

city) while his moral traits from organization
had ~ever been very exalted, although his
education had not been by any means neglect-
ed, so far as he was a graduate of one of the
first colleges in the land1 prior to falling in
with evil company, who were now almost his
exclusive associates and friends, He played
an admirabl&amp;game of billiards, drove a cur-
ride with any m~tn; and was fully proficient
in all the dissipations and follies of the day.
Antoine La Rue had became quite inti
mate in the family of the Temples, and seem-
ed to have taken a strong fancy for Helen,
which predilections Mrs. Temple seemed to
view with lively interest ~nd favorprobably
looking to the wealth that young La Rue
would inherit from his father.
Helen, howev.ir, had cast her eyes on a
young man, named Charles Poihemus, who
officiated as a clerk in a drug store in the
neighborhood. Polhemus had received an
excellent education, and having studied
physic and pharmacy, he finally e~iose the
business of a druggist's clerk for his support.
He was about tweiity.two years of age -of
very delicate frame, pale face, fair skin, blue
eyes, and the usual characteristics of such
peculiar physical and mental organization.
He was somewhat of a recluse in ,his habits,
scarcely mingling in society, or visiting any
place of amusements. His knowledge of the
world, or its worst phases, therefore, was as
limited as that of a child. He seemed to
have no idea of the heated passions and evil
propensities of man, but in his innocence
imagined the world composed of beings as
pure as himself, or tho~e few persons with
whom lie associated.. His acquaintance with
the female sex was exceedingly limited, but
he had been introduced to both Helen and
BlancheTemple, and almost instantly hadhis
tenderst sympathies enlisted in favor of
Blanche, who seemed to him the poet's dream
of loveliness personified.
It is undoubtedly thatvhuman passions

CHAPTER IX.
Tan LIBERTINE'S STRATAGEM I-" Tan
BIRDIE ZN THE CAGE !"-FoUL INTENT.
True to his promise, so ironically made to
his master, the menial Armond visited High
street market, and found little difficulty in
inducing Minny Dawson, the innocent and
unsuspecting flower-girl to bring her floral
treasures to the house of the rich merchant
Arlington, hy alleging that he designed giv-
ing a ball on the evening of that day, and
would pay liberally for the rarest boquits
that could be furnished for the occasion.-
'1'he business was managed so cautiously
by the wiley servant, that among those who
trafficked in the market, no cue knew any-
thing of it, and naturally supposed that she
had disposed of her flowers, and returned
home to the cottage of her father.
~iinny Dawson was yet but mere a child
in years, her age being about fourteen years,
but there was that voluptuousness in her
form that already betokened the full ripeucas
and glory of young womanhood. Her au-
burn hair was plaited neatly over her smooth
forehead, and so arranged to f~il in a shower
of ringlets upon her shonklers, thereby fort,,-
ing a contrast between the ~ia~hing skin

and the sunny hair that might well captivate
the eye and sensuality and awaken intense
passion in the most stoical of bosoms. Her's
wasa beauty such as

"Guido would have loved to dwell upoc ;"
but, as we are not au fait in describing the
comparative qualities of woman's charms, we
leave the reader to draw up on his own im-
agination for every attribute of sweetness
and grace, and yield thens as he legiti-
mate concomitants of the re'mailiable loveli-
ness of Minny Dawson.
in less than an hour from the time she
was accosted in the market by Armond, she
found herself seated in a large back parlor of
the rich merchant's house. Here she was
requested to wait a short time till Mr. Ar-
lington should take his breakfast and inspect
the sweet flowers for himself, before paying
for them.
Au hour passed, and then another, and
she remained alone in that gorgeous room
into which 4he had at first been ushered,
wondering the while that the owner of the
mansion, or some other person did not enter,
inspect her flowers, and let her depart.
She had full time to observe the beautiful
paintings that hung in splendid gilt frames
against the walls-the exquisite pieces of
statuary th6± stood in the recesses of the
room-the large mirrors-the chandelier of
cut glass-the rich curtains of the windows,
the costly furniture, and a Turkey carpet
that blazed in the riches of its roses and
other floral devices, while it was as soft as a
field of moss to the feet.
Her patience at length became entirely
exhausted, and becoming alarmed at the
silence which prevailed, she rose and went
to the door that led to the hall. She found
it was locked from the outside, and realized
in full force that she was a prisoner! She
uttered a loud scream, and kept up the out-
cry at so.wild a rate, that the wretch Ar-

.37

moral felt constrained to show hi~ presence
in order to quiet her clamor.
"What is all this outcry about," he said,
"in a gentleman's house? You have been
screaming as if somebody was murdering you
outright, my pretty miss! ~on't be alarmed
-no one is going to kill you, any howl But
you have got to wait till my master shall
come in. He must have forgotten you were
here when he left the house this morning."
"Oh, then, I can't stay. I must gd and
sell my flowers. See they are all drooping
already. Indeed I mu~tgo Do, sir, let me
go and sell my flowers in the market before
they all loose their freshness and fragrance.
Please do, sir I"
"Oh, no, thal will never'do! The house.
keeper will put the flowers in fresh water,
and you must remain here till my master
shall come home and give you the money for
them. Here, Margeryl Margeryl the girl
wants to go away."
The housekeeper, a sinister looking old
hag, of fifty years, now made her appearance,
and said to the girl:-
"The pretty birdie is in the cage at last,
and we cannot let her go before the master
comes to hear it sing! Oh. no, miss, you
mu~t not leave the house. He'll be here by-.
and-by, and pay you for the roses, maybe,
and let you go?"
There was that in the looks and speech of
the old hag. that more and more alarmed the
flower girl. She threw herself on her knees,

*great metropolis, so that when these
sable and begrimmed personages are
seen in the streets, they are looked upon
as objects of curious interest; nay, even
with a species of wonder and awe allied
to the fearful and superstitious, as if they
were imps of darkness from the kingdom

of Pluto, appearing on earth to proclaim!.

"Sweep, ho [ sweep, ho I" cried Black
Roif, in rich and melodious strains, dur-.
ing quite a long song, appropriate to,' an
expressive of his peculiar calling occa-
sionally branching off into extempora-
neous variations of words and music,
that gave a very amusing and extraordi-
xc nary interest to his theme.
of Suddenly, the songof the Dwarf Sweep
xe was interrupted by the loud shrieks of
~h some one in distress. RoIf instantly
a, sprang to his feet, with the agility of a
i. leopard, on the top of the small chimney

held his ear as if to catch more dis-

tentive ear, as if of a voice in the dis-

Such strange tnd inconiprehensibl(
language filled the ~heart of Black Roll
with no little amusement, commingled
with terror. He muttered-
" "I understand you not. She is no
ehild of yours! Would a father violate

"Liar! villain! She cannot be the

Arlington heeded not the words of the
powerful negro dwarf, but rushed for-
ward to the restraint of both the girl and
her black deliverer.
The dwarf finding that his only chance
of escape was by maiming, or killing his
*hite adversary outright, let slip his long
sharp bladewith tremendous energy into
the bosom of Arlington. He fell be-
neath the blow, stunned and bleeding,
as from a fatal wound!
"Murder! murder! Seize the black

His fearful cries of murder, brought
his servants Armand and Margery to the
hall just as the African had gained the

Armond instantly comprehended the
whole affair, and rushing forward, he
struck a heavy blow upon the back part
of Black Roif, which felled him to the
fioor~ as in death.
"Seize the black devil I Bind him

the bidding. of Arlington.
Armand tore the sooty garments from
the sweep, quickly bound his arms and
feet, (although th~ still insensible con-
dition of the Dwarf, rendered such pro-
cedure unnecessary,) dragged him, by
main force, as he would the dead carcass
of a dog, througji a dark passage and
down a slimy flight of steps to the dismal
vault indicated by his master, where he
thrust the helpless negro and left him
utterly to perish.
Meanwhae, Margery lifted up the
stricken girl-conveyed her very gently

carefully on a couch, and promptly ap-
plied the usual remedies to arouse her to
consciousness from the state of asphyxia
into which she seemed to have fallen.
Arlington now completely exhauste4
by his struggle with the maiden and his
fierce strife with Black Roif, threw him-
self on a sofa in the parlor, and en~
deavored to compose himself, as he was
able, in the relaxation of his nerves and
mental energies. What his reflections
were may probably be imagined. They,

At the end of some minutes, Armand
entered the room, and reported the ful-
filment Qf the commands he had received
from his master.
"The black imp is secure enough now~

hind him till he reached the river, shen
he fell fainting in the arms of the old
Waterman Switzer, who had accompanied
him in his boat on hi~ errand to the cave
of the Sorceress.
The old man first laved George's brows
with the cool waters of the Schuyl~dll-
and then drawing a ~1ask of gin from his
pocket, rubbed violently the wrists and
hands of the stricken youth.
The swoon was only of temporary du-
ration, but on his recovery, the young
man refused to inform his friend Switzer
of what had occurred or been revealed to
him in the wild den of the Red Witch.
"Not now, good Switzerl Some

head has been harmed, he shall die I"
The old Waterman could comprehend
nothing of this wild ar~d mysterious lan-
guage. He at once concluded that
George had gone sad-stark mad, and
plied his oars to teach the city with all
possible speed.
The instant the boat touched the

lie was soon out of sight~ and the old
waterman did not venture to follow him.
He could only return to the gardener's
I cottage, explain matters as well as he was
able to George's father, and await the
issue of the wild youth's mysterious de-
signs.

of love, however, had. now produced an
amount of coldness in the feelings of
Arlington that threatened a complete
estrangement of conjugal ~sentiment be-
tween the twain. Indeed~ had not cer~
tam providential #~onsideraAjons of a mo-
nentary character outweighe~I the bitter.
ness and disappointment of both, in the
lack of issue, a violent rupture would
undoubtedly have been the reauh.
Arlington, after the marriage of Wal-
sirigham, who at the time was his part-
ner in business, in a branch establish-
ruent of the father of the latter, was
called to New Orleans on somebusiness
connected with' a final possession of his
wife's estate and inheritance in Louisiana.
His absence was unavoidably prolonged,
and he was still unable to fix a time for
a return to his home in I~hiladelphia.
Meantime, however, Arlington's house
was ever daily and nightly a scene of~
gayety and revelry. Visitors of both
sexes came and went, scarcely without
restraint, and with but little ceremony,
and p~irticipat~d in the pleasures arid
dissipatron which the generous hospi-
'tality of Mrs. Arlington permitted to be
pursued beneath her roof. These ex-
cesses finally were calculated to arrest
public attention,' from the promiscuous
character of the guests-the sumptuous-
ness of the entertainments, midnight
orgies as they really wore, given and
held by a young wife and most beautiful
and voluptuous woman, while her hus.
band was absent from home on business
in a distant Southern city.
There came to the entertainments
given by Mrs. Arlington, during her
husband's sojourn abroad, the savant, the
sawyer, the clergyman, the statesman,

the poet, and those of all grades of pur-
suit and rank in society, including even
the rouc and the gambler-among the
latter two sort of people, none more noto-
rious than a person ~ho we shall now
introduce as Colonel Burlington, aria the
youngnrcrehant, Walsirigham, who, how-
ever, had but recently married Mary
'Walton, the school companion of the
whilom Minerva Raybold, Arlington's
wife. Wakiinghaxn, in fnet, htwl been a
suitor for the hand of Minerva Raybold,
but the beautiful young heiress having
already pledged her troth to Arlington,
he was necessarily forced to look in
another quarter fora spouse, and, accord-
ingly became the husband of Mary
Walton.
The intimacy which subsisted between
the young wives of Walsirigham and
Arlington was naturally very free and
cordial. Indeed, so artless and confiding
was Mrs. Arlington, that Walsirigham
received her esteem and confidence-nor
did she dream that by so doing she ren-
dered her seemingly reckless yet really
virtuous conduct open to scandal in the
eyes of a censorious world. Her dispo-
sition was volatile-her affections warm
-her passions ardent-without a
thought of what mischievous conse-
quences would be likely to follow such
gayety of character, unbalanced by strong
reason and deep considerate reflection of
the proprieties and conventionalities of
society. She was a creature who acted
from the strong impulses of her nature,

stricken woman. Here he remained
sometime, when he came out into the
conservatory, and perceiving Arlington's
man-servant Armond, bade him Thi1 fe-
male attendants to wait upon their
mistress.
*      *       *      *      *
The ball was over. Arlington arrived
tt home a few weeks thereafter, and ap-
peared rather pleased than otherwise that
his fair young wife, had so gayly and
generously kept up the hospitalities of
his house during his hbsenc&amp; He
dreamed of nothing, suspected nothing,
implicating the purity of his wife.
Several months elapsed when he dis.
covere~l in a drawer of a bureau of hi~
wife's boudoir, a letter scarcely becoming
to be retained in the possession of a mar~
ned woman. It breathed a fervency ol
passion such as only lovers might feel in
the honied hour of impassionate suit
To this letter was attached a poetic
fictionate name, while it was without date
which proved very fortunate things a
the time. This amorous billet-doux an
rested the attention of Arlington, am
induced him to examine a number o
others that were its companions in th
drawer. They were generally letters o

friendship from her acquaintances, and
her uncle, with some few of a more
tender character that had been addressed
to her by gallants who had sought to win
her for a bride. They bore dates and
proper signatures which left no d~ubt of
havingbeen received by hiawifein an hono
rably way prior to his marriage with her.
His suspicions were aroused. The
letter was in the hand writing of his
friend and business partner, Wi~lsing-
ham. His wife's rotundity of form, also
indicated that she would shortly give
birth to a child. He thought of his
long absence from home, leaving his
young and fascinating wife exposed to all
the temptations of licentious society.
His bosom was filled' with doubt. The
more he doubted and reflected the more
convinced he became of his wife's infi-
delity. He could contain his suspicions
no longer. He produced the fatal docu-
ment and angrily charged the crime of
adultery upon her. A violent quarrel
was the result of her assertion of inno-
cence. He would not however be satis-
fied. He questioned his servants con-
cerning her private habits during his
long absence from home.
The revelations that were made, were
not calculated to relieve the uneasiness
of mind under which he labored. Nay,
F the proofs of his wife's guilt were clear
and abundant. His servant Armond ic-
lated the suspicious circumstance during
1 th~ grand ball, when Walsinghann had
been seen to come forth from the private
t chamber of Mrs. Arlington. The female
- domestics detailed the peculiar condition
I in which they had found the young wife,
f on that occasion, when they were sent to
e her assistance by the command of Wal.
f singham.

Arlington now compelled his wife to
keep to the seclusion of her chamber,
and gave it out that she had suddenly
become afflicted with an eruptive malady,
of an infectious character, which pre-
cluded her from being seen by any one
save her female attendants and the phy-
sician. His word, backed by the solemn
assertions of the solemn-visaged tool
of Arlington, an unprincipled disciple of
Esculapius, was not questioned, and so
the matksr rested until she gave birth to
her child, and died' either from
the throes of labor or else from the ef-
fects of poison administered in some
wine of ergot that the physician admin-
istered at the time.
* The death of Mrs. Arlington was duly
proclaimed, but the knowledge of her
having given birth to a child was kept
a secret from the world. He procured
a private coffin, placed her remains in
the same, and left it to mouldert into
dust in the apartment in which the wo-
man had died, locking the door, and
sternly forbidding his domestics ever, to
enter the chamber upon penalty of his
great displeasure and punishment for the
offence.
Meantime, however, he ordered to be
procured a most sumptuous burial case,
with the showy hearse and mourning
habliments, and 'passed through all the
solemn ceremonials * of the obsequies, as
though he mourned the l~oss of his wife
and could not be comforted, when he saw
the empty coffin consigned to a vault of
the church where he so hypocritically
prayed and worshipped.
The midwife who officiated at the birth
of the child was the worthy old mother
O'Hara. This event took place during
the same day, and within a few hours

after her return home from the strange
and mysterious birth-bed of the an-
known~ darkly veiled lady of the gorgeous
mansion, whose location was also un-
known to her, somewhere over the waters
of the Delaware, on the dread night of
the terrible storm, as narrated in a pre-
vious chapter.
It was a strange coincidence, if nothing
more. She received from the dying
wife of Arlington a purse of gold, together
with a piece of jewelry precisely of the
same pattern and bearing the same initial
letters as the gem given her by the veiled
lady, whose child a few hours before
she had brought to her humble home.
The babe born to Mrs. Arlington wa~
also conveyed to her dwelling by com-
mand of Arlington, but being a very
fragile thing, it survived but a few hours
after Mother O'Hara's return to her
domicile. She buried it secretly in the
earth of her cellar, and kept her secret
from all except her daughter Norah.
The living child she soon disposed
of in a matter satisfactory to her~ hu-
manity and conscience. She managed
to make the merchant Arlington believe
that this child was the one that had been
borne to his wife, and received for many
years an annual suni of money for its
support.
At length, however, in the vicissitudes
of human affairs this protege of the mid-
wife and the merchant, became lost to
them both, in the death or removal of
the party in whose charge the infant girl
had been placed.

his request and at once inducted him

Providence, beneath his sympathizing
and guardianly care. You may be sure,
sir, I was greatly astonished when about
to return from Java; while at Batavia, to
be informed that my young clerk was a
woman. It was then that I more clearly
comprehended the motivess which influ-
enced her to assum~ the habilimonts of
the opposite sex and risk the perils of an
ocean life. ~ufflce it to say, she cher-
ished some sweet pi~rposo in visiting the
island, and begged permission to remain
behind till she should be able to accom-
plish the end thereof. I was convinced
that her story was true, and sympathized
with her wrongs. It was enough for me
to apJ~rehend that the wrong-doer was
supposed to be living in some part of
Java, and therefore I questioned ~ier
neither concerning her own proper name
nor the one borne by the villain for whom
she was in ~uch determined pursuit.
When I offered to provide her with funds
to further her designs, I found that her
means were amply abundant. Indeed,
she also insisted upon paying for her
passage out, although she had served me
~aithfnlly as a hand on boai~d the ship, to
which proposition, of course, I would
not listen. ' I provided her a comforta-
ble home, in the bosom of a family of a
respectable Dutch merchant, to await
the issue of her affairs, and continued
my' pursuits at sea. I parted from her,
and did not meet her again until ten
years afterwards, when I found her still
sojourning at Batavia, and brought her
back a passenger in my ship to New

motive I had for diverting your attention
in that direction.".
"We have then, as you say, only to
await the issue of events, Captain. We
cannot pull aside the curtainof the Past
nor lift the veil of the Future. I must
hide accordingly my time. But that lit.
tle romance in your own history, Captain.
It is yet early. Will you narrate it
now?"
"As you please, Walsiugham. I will
make the story very short. I am fortu-
nately able to give it more succinctly
from a manuscript I happen now to have
with me, which document I found among
the papers of my deceased foster~father.
It is to this effect: When I was a child'
apparently about five years of age, I was
*bund lying asleep under a small boat,
which was placed bottom upwards on the
deck of a schooner, which my foster-1
father, Captain Van Veckten, com-
manded, after it had left the wharf at
Philadelphia and put to sea. I was too
young to give any intelligible account of
the manner how I came on board, or
eve~i to give my family name. The
Captain, however, took pity on my for
bra condition, and although he realized
that my parents must hay experienced
poignant sorrow at my t~ them unac-
countable disappearance, he did not feel
warranted to put back to port and sur-
render me to my friends. The voyage
was to Canton, and it was two years be-
fore he could return to Philadelphia and
institute inquiry in my behalf. lie ad-
surtised the circumstances under which
I was found on board his ship, but re-
ceived no response to his details. Mean-
time he gave mc his own name, and con-

tinted to me as a friend and father, from
t~he first hour he saw me till the day of
his death, a period of about twenty years
altogether. It may interest you, also,
my dear Walsiagham, that I have still
in my possession the identical suit of
clothing I wore at the time I was dis-
covered in my infancy, so to speak, on
board the 'Sea Gull,' which was the
name of the craft, my good old friend,
the skipper Van Veckten, then com-
manded. I have likewise a full length
portrait of myself, which the old Cap~ain
caused to be painted on his return voyage
with a view to ray identification by my
friends. Besides these things, I have
likewise a miniature of a lady, doubtless
that of m~y mother, which was concealed
in my bosom, suspended by a fine gold
chain from my neck, at the time I was
found by the Captain on board his vessel.
This bauble. and the other articles, may
possibly one of these days afford a clue
to my own legitimate origin, though so
many years have already passed,. I
scarcely expect now 'ever to be en-
lightened on so important and interest-
ing a point."
"Really, Captain Van Veckten, your
own history is equally remarkable with
that of the Wierd Sister of the Cave.
It is certainly a romance in real life, cx-
ceeding in interest any novel I have ever
read."
"Indeed, Conradin, my adventures
~from first to last would make a book
quite as entertaining as that of either

Killer," or even "Oulliver's Travels,"

out of my body! I'll tell you all I
know about the ugly business, Master
Dawson !"
"Well, do it, quickly then !"
"The girl was young and pretty, it is
very true, but what her name and
whence she caine, I can not tell you, sir!
But of her death I am entirely innocent!.
Indeed, as Cod shall judge mc! lam,
Mr. Dawson."
"Who then is 'her destroyer? How
did she come to her death! Reveal the
truth and your life shall be spared."
"So I will-so I will, sir. Return

with me now, to the house of Cobuel
Burrell, and you shall know everything
about this work of crime and h~rror."
"I will trust you, sir. Arise, and
we'll go instantly to the accursed mur-
derer's den."
"I'll not deceive you, sir, that I will
not! Indeed, I am anxious to release
my conscience of the affair, and I care
not if judge and jury shall hang me for
my part in the foul deed!"
"Enough I" cried George, ~letting
Wilkins rise to his feet, but keeping
him firmly grasped by the collar of his.
coat. Turning to the old grave-digger,
he added:
"Hark you, old man! Finish up the
dark work you have begun, nor disturb
a sod again till you ~ar from me, at the
peril of your life! There, take that, and
begone from here, as soon as possible."
He planed in the hands of the old
man sevem4ml pieces of coin as he spoke;
and, grasp ing Wilkins' arm, hurried
away to the mansion. He had no time
now to drop a tear over the grave of his
supposed sister. His whole soul was
absorbed with ofie terrible idea. His
bosom burned for vengeance upon' the
suspected seducer and murderer!

Tim DEATH STRUGGLES

Wilkins was by no means the equal of
George Dawson, in physical power, iron
muscle, and elasticity of movement, and.
having had proof of this fact already, he
walked rapidly at the side of his young
I and vigorous adversary, without either a

murmur or any attempt at resistance or
escape. George, however, was too wary
to be thrown off his guard for an instant,
and was ready to inflict summary pun-
ishment upon Wilkins the moment he
should detect anything like treachery or
bad faith on his part in the promise he
had voluntarily giVen to accompanyy him
to the house of Colonel Burrelt.
They hurried along in silence, and
reached a' rear avenue that led to the
stable and carriage house of the libertine
Burrell, just at the moment that the town
'clock struck the hour of two o'clock in
the morning.
The front part of the house was closed
'snd had the appearance of being entirely
untenanted The rear, however, was
brilliantly illuminated, while strains of
inspiring music, commingled with the
sounds of revelry, came forth upon the
balmy zephyrs of the morning hour.
Colonel Burrell had returned from the
theatre with a large party oi~ his friends,
including a celebrated actress, in order
to partake of a champagne supper, for
which he bad previously arranged with
his French cook.
Thus it was, youth and beauty, the
gay and the thoughtless, were there as-
sembled, at that hour of night in the
elegant and ample mansion of the dis-
tinguished citizen and lawyer, libertine
and villain as he was well known to be
by the inhabitants generally.
Thus it was that bright eyes flashed
amid the glare of light from innumerable
wax candles that filled the cups of the
great chandeliers whose glass pendants
hur~g down like diamond lobes, and
sparkled brightly in the refulgence that
was shed around.
Thus it was that the merry strains of

music arose on the calmness of the nioOri-
shiny night-that the shuffling of many
feet, and the joyous laugh, fold that the
hours were being passed in the reveiryof
a social and impromptu ball.
IDawson and Wilkins passed through
the stables and stood, in the middle of the
garden beneath the shadow of a huge
Italian chestnut tree, and watched the
movements of the revellers as they
passed to and from the windows, up and
down the large saloon, in the mazy evo-
lutions of the dance.
Presently young iDawson caught a
glimpse of the tall and elegant figure,
'and dark grizzly hair, of the owner of
the mansion. He saw him bend his
smiling face close to the ear of the ac-
tress and whisper something into her
ears that caused her to smile bewitch-
ingly, and to cast upon him a glance-
oh, too full of 1~he wanton's coquetry and
cunning, yet concealed, in sonic degi-ec,

that was going forward between the sin-
ful pair.
"Accursed villain!" exclaimed George,
"I can contain myself no longer! I
will rush in on him, and slay the vile
seducer and murderer in the midst of his
carnival of merriment and sensuality !"
He made a bound as if to put his
thoughts into execution; but Wilkins
sprang forward also, grasped him by the
arm, and, holding him back, exclaimed:
"Nay, nay, Dawson! Be not thus so
rash and headlong, lest you fail in your
deep retaliation of the man. Learn first
the particulars of the young woman's
death, ere you stain your own soul with
human blood! believe me, young man,

instantly discharged it in the face of his
adversary. Fortunately the ball only
grazed his cheek, leaving a mark, and
causing a slight flow of blood. ,
" Miserable paltroon," cried George,
"your life is now completely in my po wer !

Burrell gazed around the room, and
then quickly scanned the physical pro-
portions of Dawson in contrast with his
own. D~awson's frame was certainly
considerably larger and heavier, but
scarcely equal in muscu'ar power and
pliability t~o that of his own. His first
impulse was to rush forward, knock the
pistol from the young man's hand, and
by activity and main force hurl him into
the dust.
Dawson's quick eye detected something
of the sinister purpose of his adversary.

and he fired upon him. The ball took
effect in Burrell's shoulder. He uttered
a yell of pain and rage, and rushed like
a wild boar uporn George. They grap-
pled and strggled manfully together.
but the ,Colonel soori found that he had
a fair match in the youth, whose strong
hands now pressed ,powerfully against
his throat. The struggle -became more
fierce.
.Suddenly George received a terrible
blow over his head, which caused him
to reel around like a top, but without
falling. His vision was completely knock-
ed from him for the time being. Bur-
rell saw the advantage he had gained-
sprang upon George, and endeavored to
throttle. the living principle from his
body. He, however, quickly recovered
his sight and equilibrium, and, raising
his feet, with almost superhuman power
he planted them full in the abdomen of
Burrell, who instantly relaxed his hold
upon the young man's neck, and stagger-
ed backward, nearly overcome with pain
and the loss of breath. ,Both of the an-
tagonists had now a moment's respite,
during which they respectively gathered
wind and strength, when they again
clutched in horrible strife Now the
long hair of George fell over his eyes.

round in his hand, and commenced
dragging Dawson,as with giant's strength,
towards the window.
" Fool !" exclaimed Burrell, " would
you grapple with a man who has never

Ha ! ha ! It only remains for me to

fore. Indeed, to say the truth, friend
Switzer, I was glad that my wife took a
fancy to the strarIget~ darling, and agreed
with her that we should adopt the child,
and rear her as one of our flesh and
blood."
"Just like you both, T)awson. Your
wife, I know, was a very tender-hearted
woman. When I lost my own wife, and
all my children, in one week, by the
fever, your wife was always at our house,
doing all that she could for our sick peo-
ple. Oh, I 8hall never forget your wife.
Heaven rest her, kind, good soul that
she was, Dawson."
"My son George was in his fifth ye~
when his baby-brother died and little
Ninny was given as his sister. But, as
I was saying, it was a cold winter's
night. There' had been a heavy fall of
snow all the night before we buried our
babe, and we had much difficulty to get
to the grave-yard in our sleds, on account
of the great depth of snow, which had
Iot yet been broken down by travel ~o
'soon after the storm. When we returned
home, and wem all seated around a good
'fire in the' little parlor there of this cot-
Mge, we heard the cries of a young babe
in our porch, which startled us very
much. At first the cries sounded like
the lamentations of a cat, and my wife
bade me step to the door andlet in the
old puss that was perishing in the cold.
There was no cat there, but the dear
babe. It was placed in the very thres-
hold of the door, wrapped up warmly in
a ~oarse blanket, lyin~ in a common
market basket, and crying? for dear life.

Ninny became our adopted child."
I "And was there no one whom you
suspected of placing the babe af your
door-sill, good Dawson ?"
* £~ No one whatever. We knew of no
one likely to be it's mother in this neigh-
borhood, and the great city was too far
away to go and make much inquiry.
We could imagine no clue to the child's
parentage. There were many boot prints
in the snow, but a goodly nun4er of
our friends had attended the funeral of
our cherub, and the snow marks we sup-
posed were made by the company. I
took up a dark lantern and looked all
about the garden and sheds, but I dis
covered nothing unusual. At length I
found tracks in the garden in the rear
and at one side of the house. There I
followed and observed that they all point-
ed as those of a person coming from the
river to the cottage There was no trace
of footsteps showing that the party re-
traced his steps from the cottage to the
water. The snow was a foot deep and
very light, so I could not he certain these
marks were by a rr~an or woman."
"Butyou afterwards discovered, Daw-

age?"
"Nothing have I discovered of Miii-
ny's origin from that day to this."
"Was there no token or mark of any
kind that pointed to the condition or po-
sition of the parents of the babe ?"

The old gardener without replying
went to a bureau, and speedily brought

placed it in the hands of Switzer.
"The money is all there, I suppose,
just as it was at first. I considered it a
trust for the child, and have kept the~
treasure sacred for her portion when she
should become of age."
"This is remarkable, indeed. You

Tie old ga~'dener dropped into hi

and tears.
"Nay my poor afflicted friend, griev
not thus so hopc~Iessly. Nay, George inns

"Aye my brave, good boy 'cried the
old gardener, "you counsel wisely, Swit-

acted wrongly in the sight of Heaven,
let the prayers of his poor old father in-
tercede for him before the holy throne.
Come Switzer-come George-let us all
knee! and pray God to deliver us out of
this sore trouble."
On the instant, the father and son and
friend dropped themselves upon their
knees. There in the silence of the early
morning hour, the stricken father offered
a fervent, heartfelt petition for the de-

r- liverance of his beloved son from crime
o and for the repose ef his dead daughter's
i, soul.
Suddenly the cottage door was thrust
s open, and several policemen seized the
s young man, even there on his knees,
while the aged parent prayed for his

t communion of mortal man with his God."

with a foul murder and must go to pri.

I "I am ready and willing, officers!"
replied George in a quiet voice and
composed manner. "Lead the way.
The Walnut jail has no terrors for me.
A jury of peers will try my cause, and
I God will protect the just."
"Nay, nay, do not drag him away

"Grieve not in this way, my 'dear

brave and honorable. He is no murderer,
and Heav~n will not let him perish.
Let him go-let the youth go with the

in 'the house of Arlington, although she
yet remitined ignorant of many mysteries
in which she had became involved in her
capacity of a midwife.
"Now, Armand," said Margery, "the
girl is sleeping soundly, and is not likely
to awake for sonic hours to come. In.~
deed, to make sure that she will not be
disturbed in her slumbers, I have ad-
ministered a sleeping portion that will
keep her in that state, at least until the
cock shall crow the break of morning.
Will you now explain to me the meaning
of the picture of the wonan with an
asp sucking at her heart, which so
frightened me when I passed through the
Picture Gallery adjoining Thany's apart-
ment this morning?'
"Oh, certainly, Margery. There
could be no better opportunity than the
present to relate all about it."
"The serpent mark on the bosom of
the Floi~er Girl must in some way be
connected with that strange picture, I
am sure.~,
"The thing is quite probable, Mar-
gery."
"This is the same villa, too, to which
I was brought to deliver the babe, on
that stormy night. I know it now by
the dark drapery of the couch and win-
dows of this room! These things re-
main just a~ they were on that myste-
rious occasioii. T he room, too, was cool,
and there is yet the same old clock, and
here the bust of General Washington,
exactly in the same position they were
at that time.
"You ar~ right, Margery! Nothing
'has been changed here since that child
was born, and taken hence in your
arms.
"So IL thought, Armand."

"The picture is called Cleppatra, and
is grounded on some incident ~N the lives
of that remarkable wom~in and Mark
Anthony."
"Ab, I see through it all now, Ar-
mand. The veiled Jady who gave birth
to the child I took away, must have re-
ceived some aifright, or had her mind
strongly impressed by the curious pic-
ture, to leave so wonderful a birth-mark
upon the bosom of her child"
"Even so, I presume; but the doc-
tors, IL believe, cannot satisfactorily ac-
count for these strange freaks of dame
Nature.
"No, I suppose not; but what ~uz-
zles me more Armand, is to really know
whether the babe I took from hence can
possibly be this Flower Girl, Minny Daw-
son. I caused the babe to be left at the
door of a cottage house on the banks of
the Rancocas Creek, but some time af-
terwards when IL desired to learn some-
thing about the fate of the child, IL found
that the cottagers had removed from the
place, and I was accordingly unable to
obtain any clue to her destiny.
"But you made Arlington believe
that the child lived and that you were
obliged to pay over every year to certain
parties a handsome sum of money for its
support."
"True, true, Armand, IL always made
him believe his daughter was alive, but
would never disclose to him in whose
family she remained, for the simple rea-
son IL knew nothing about it myself,
Armand ;"
"ILt would be a strange coincidence
indeed, if two children should have
the same marks on their breasts. No,

smothered him in her embrace of grati-
tude, mixed with impulsive kisses and
tears
"Nay, nay, Margery, you owe me no
thanks. I candidly tell yen, I only
knew you as mi midwife and had no es-
pecial love or regard for you. I consulted

much capital I could make out of the
whole matter, that was all, Margery-
heaven forgive me for saying so."
"Well, well, as you didn't kill me, I
forgive you-freely forgive you, Ar-

"After drowning you all, we were, on
landing, to knock a hole in the boat and
make it sink with the ballast of stones
it contained, near the wharf, after our
own safety was secured"
"And Arlington never found out that
you deceived him in not browning us

"Even so"

"It was a lucky thing, Margery, that

"Oh, you have nothing to fear now

my bosom so long as we shall keep upon

"I am your friend, Armand! Do
never let Arlington know anything about
the deception I have practiced upon bini
in regard to the two babes. If he thinks
the woman who delivered the babe here
in this villa, and also the child were
destroyed by you and Wilkins, of course
you will never undeceive him."
"Not I, indeed, Margery! but never

ignorant of almost everything of human

that we were both guilty of ter-ible

the infamy that was east upon the purity

distinctly, Armand."
"So much the better, Margery, it

planations otherwise necessary to be un-

"Yes, I see that it will."

"Well, then, she was a wicked wo-

"It was eighteen months after his

delight to, be who love their lords."
"You mean, Armand that she was
likely to have a child."
" Yes. The husband and wife had

Had they lived happily together

"They had not. They disagreed be-

about to leave the house, when he ob-
served Mary standing in an arbor in the
garden in conversation with her nephew
C~onradin, and her cousin Ida. He con-
cluded that he would also take a turn in
the garden and wait an opportunity to
address the young wife. Being regarded
as the confidential clerk of Walsinghamn,
he was treated more as an inmate of the
merchant's house, and it was his wont to
. .  make himself as agreable as possible both
to Mary and her cousin Ida. Presently,
seeing Mary was ,about to return to the
house all alone, Ida and Conradin having
quitted her side; he came forth from an
arbor to greet her. Ida, however crossed
his path, and diverted his attention from
the object he had in view His eager-
ness to speak to Mary excited her jea-
lousy,. and confirmed her in what Arling-
Ston had led her to believe, in regard to
his criminality with the young wife.-
He broke away from her as gently as he
could, but she deemed the repulse as a
wilful insult to her personal charms.
'This led her to devise some speedy re-
venge upon him. She .did not doubt
that he would repair to the arbor to meet
' her cousin Mary, but she did not know
anything about' the note that Ar-
lington had sent Walsingham, and which
the latter subsequently placed on the
-dressing table in his wife s chamber.-
She intended when she wrote the letter
for Arlington, to receive Thornton her-
self at the midnight hour, and entrap
him into a dalliance of love, but now she
.resolved to meet him, and, instead of ac-
cents of love, to speak daggers to his

man to the heart !"
"Even so, Margery. And now we
are coming to the point. Arlington was
more particularly anxique that Harvey
Walsingham and Ida Walton should"/b,
put out of the way, at all'events, and did
not care if the lives of Mary and Thorn-
ton should also be sacrificed through the
complexity of his strategem. He rightly
conjectured that Walsinghanm would lie
in waiting for there meeting of his wife
and Thornton, in the arbor, and, so disq
covering fthem, that he would rush in
and slay them in their apparent criminal
conversation."
" Oh, how dark and horrible was that.
plot, Armand !"
" Truly, it was; but you have not
heard how it terminated. Arlington
knew well enough -that Walsinghamn
would place the note purporting to come
from Thornton in the way oft Mary, bt -
he did not suppose for an instant thit
Walsingham's pure wife would keep
such appointment with Thorniton. He,
however, calculated that Ida Waltoz
would be there in the arbor at the ap-
pointed time, disguised in Mary's cloth-
ing, and that she would throw herself
into Thornton's arms before he would be
.able to comprehend the strategem."
" And did it fall out as Arlington
imagined it would ?"
"Precisely to the very letter."
" Most extraordinary, indee'd."

The news of the murder of Colonel
Burrell soon became spread over the city,
and tl~,e arrest of George Dawson, and
his explanation of the affair, caused an
intense excitement among the pcople.-
This feeling was further increased, when
Ninny Dawson suddenly returned to her
home and learned of the troubles and
horrors that had arisen on account of her
abduction and mysterious disappearance.
She detailed to the 'old gardener and
their friend Switzer, all that had trans-
pWed in connection with herself since
her absence. Then accompanied by her
guardian parent, and friend, made the
necessary affidavit for the arrest of Ar-
lington and his accomplices.
The police, accordingly, promptly re-
paired to the merchant's house, but find-
ing it tenantless, made a forcible entry
and searched it from the attic to the
vaults.. They found it thoroughly ra -
sacked as if burglars had been at wor
and carried off everything of portable
value. In the dark, damp vaults' they
found the murdered remains of Black
Rolf, with the flesh already eaten off the
bones by rats; and on further research
in the wine cellar, there was discovered
a large hole in the wall, which led to a
culvert or water-course in the street. On
pursuing this, they found another~ avenue
which led through a similar passage into
the cellar of Burrell's house, situated
several blocks away from Arlington's
mansion. The police had already found
that Burrell's house had beenpillaged in
a similar manner to the dwelling of Ar-
lington, while the dead bodies of the
libertine lawyer and Wilkins added to
the general horror of the scene.
