ON a memorable evening, in the last of September, a fortnight after my clandestine visit to my grandfather's chambers-the comet, then our wondrous visitor from space, was first unveiled to my gaze, in its full splendor End sublimity. I use the term unveiled advisedly. For ten days before that night the face of the heavens had been covered with clouds, and behind these the small nebulous plume, so faintly traced on'the sky before they gathered over it, as to be scarcely distinguish- able from a floating mist, had gained in size and grandeur and brilliancy, until at the first withdrawal of the curtains it burst  :  upon us, in plenitude of power and beauty, the most splendid     , vision my eyes had ever witnessed.  The impression it made on my mind can never be effaced, or surpassed even by a successor of ,superior size and brilliancy, if such be possible. It seemed a direct and manifest herald to the world from the throne of the most High-a spark, perhaps, from the glorious crown itself, to rouse the drooping energies of such    as doubted, and bring more thrillingly close to the Creator those . who believed. A great silence, a sort of trance-like ecstasy fell on me in the . :! presence of this glorious stranger, and enjoyment uninterrupted by thought or memory--a new and exquisite sensation that with , me Can never be repeated. Nor was it, until the comet wheeled    !   6       ITHF IIOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. down behind the western horizon, or rather faded ghostlike beneath its verge, that I turned from the contemplation of the heavens to seek my pillow. The household belowstairs had long been rapt in slumber when I lay down, not to sleep, for I was too much excited for this ; but to lie with closed eyes and suspended life in that quiet, rigid attitude which might, by a careless observer, be mistaken for one of repose. A superficial slumber must at last, however, have supervened on that intense nervous condition ; for I thought that my grand- father was bending over my bed, and that Fabius stood near him, 'holding his dark lantern. I started from my pillow, roused by the sound of parting foot- steps, a faint light pervaded the room, which came from the taper in my grandmother's chamber. I had a perfect recollection of closing the door of communication between our apartments, when I laid down, to exclude this light; it now stood open. "She has been in my room," I thought; "the parting steps were hers. I have been moaning in my sleep again, I suppose; or, perhaps, she is lonely, and wants to hear me breathing near her. Something unusual has occurred ; what can it be? Or, was this a vision of sudden death?"' I continued ; "Is my grandfather stricken in his solitude-and has his spirit come to warn me?"' The thought brought the cold dew to my forehead, and I sat in my bed with my fingers clasped over my face., In another , )'! moment my head was raised, and my hands were extended in   i terror. I was startled by the clang of a door sharply shut, and 1 the grating noise of a key turned suddenly in a lock-that of the ! secret stairway I well knew, from the direction of the sound. I  sprang to my feet, and rushed into the adjoining room.    i   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.         7 The taper was burning near the hearth, on which a few brands still smoldered. The room was unoccupied, save by the sleeper in the bed, whose deep stertorous breathing filled the silence. There was something alarming to me in the unusual sound. I was by her side in an instant, vainly essaying to rouse her, the veins in her brow were swollen, and her lips and neck were hot-while her clenched hands evidenced some internal struggle. I then, for the first time in my life, perceived the peculiar smell of chloroform (familiar to me since then) and I knew Chat some powerful agent had been employed to produce the, effects I wit- nessed. I should have flown to the wing in quest of Dr. Quintil in another moment, had she not commenced to recover slowly, as from a deep sleep. My voice seemed to have reached her ear, for, spreading out her hands, like one groping in darkness, she   I said- "You are here, Lilian, I think." "Yes, grandmother, by your side-and you, are better!" "What is this, Lilian? Am I blind again ; where is Erastus? I saw him bending over me with his terrible battery, I believe before the darkness fell on. me. How has he dared to enter my  chamber?  Who admitted him? oh, surely! not you--not you, my Lilian?"                             - "Grandmother, you must not even dream   of wronging me thus. I am quite incapable ;" sobs choked my utterance. "I  know it, darling. I speak wild words, but I feel so strangely here," and she pressed her hand upon he; brow. "Per- haps this is death, Lilian; or perhaps God is afflicting me with madness at last, and I have only imagined that he was near me;    A but even these are better to meet thaii blindness again." "Grandmother, you have been shamefully drugged and robbed,    8       THE HOUSEHOLD OF0 BOUVERIE. Ivfear." And as I spoke, I glanced at the open secretary drawer, in the lock of which the keys were still swinging. "Look at those keys in motion yet; the matter is very recent." 4 Examine the drawer, Lilian (it was that in which her jewels were kept), and ascertain my loss." I obeyed her, and as I remained silent, she asked me again a Little impatiently: "Lilian, what has my loss been?"   I replied in low and sorrowful tones, at once that revealed to her my own convictions, and awoke or confirmed her own. "Grandmother, your diamonds are gone. All else is untouched." She made no remark ; she did not even utter an exclamation, -but lay quietly for some moments, then calling me to come to her, she said: "You will find all the outer doors locked I think, Lilian, one key of the secret stairs is under my pillow, the other carefully put away in my bureau-these are out of the question-how this entrance was effected is a mystery to me." "I think I can afford you a clue," I said, after some hesitation, and I told her of the wax I had removed from the wards of the duplicate key, which Fabius had restored to me. She listened with grave surprise. "I regard this simply as a business matter," she said. "I attach no sentiment to it, none at all; do not feel for me on' that account, no act of his could astonish me. The lock was a curious one, made with a view to my security, not his, since egress was always afforded him through the basement floor-had he been imprudent enough to take advantage of the privilege, or base enough to break his solemn oath. Mr. Bouverie is a voluntary  captive in this house."    . /   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.         9 There was something so dry, so cold in her accent, that it struck to my heart. I remained silent, but my tears flowed abundantly.            i  Do not give way to such emotion, Lilian; it is useless. We will allude no more, if you please, to the events of this night. We will try to forget them, darling. Now retire." I hesitated. She waved her hand, and I obeyed her. The door stood open between us, but I heard no further sound; yet I think she framed her resolution that night to see him no more!  How strange it is, that entire separation of the outer and inner life, so sternly forced upon us in all times of sorrow and suffering I The' external management of matters was quite unchanged by the internal revolution that had taken place in the bosoms of more than one member of the-household of Bouverie.  I remember that on the morning after the occurrence that changed the whole current of affairs with us, the different methods of making coffee were discussed with great animation by Dr. Quin- tilian and my grandmother, and a final preference given to the old Virginia plan. I could not enter into this. I was silent, heart-struck. Their calmness was incomprehensible to me. In the meantime Dr. Quintil changed the lock of the secret stairway with his own hands, having in reserve another, different from the first, yet equally curious and complicated. Interior bolts were also added to every door in the chamber. His face was a shade paler, a thought sterner than usual, and this was all that betrayed any connection of ideas on his part, between the mechanical act he was performing and the crime that pre- faced it. l*-   10       TTHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVE9IlE. While he was working, I saw Bianca, who sat at her sewing in my grandmother's room, steal one frightened, furtive glance toward him--one, and one only-unobserved by any one else, but which revealed plainly to me her knowledge of the whole transaction. As to Fabius, his usual imperturbability sustained him well-he still went and came like a shadow-wearing always the same im- passive face, intent, as usual, on the performance of his duties, and providing, according to custom, the choicest dainties the house afforded for his master's table. He did not seem to remark the cessation of intercourse between the lower and upper floors of Bouverie. Yet once or twice each day, I caught his eye fixed earnestly upon me, with an expression of inquiry and anxiety not to be mistaken, even in its glassy in- expressiveness, and blue vacuity.                ; There was a stern sorrow in my grandmother's face, in spite of her declared indifference, and an avoidance of all interchange of glances with me, that made me afraid to question her de- cision.  That she had arrived at one, I, who knew her moods so well, 7, could scarcely doubt. What this was I could only blindly con- jecture. Was it only for a given space that she would refrain  ; from his presence-just to give him time for consideration and repentance, which bitterly as he disavowed its possibility in his nature, was, as I believed, already at work in his heart; or had : she assumed the sternest prerogative of justice known to human  nature in her absolute despotism, and sentenced him to solitude forever!                            ! But no, this should not be. Every voice of. my soul cried out against it. For a time I would forbear, and obey. It was right, :   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUOVKIE.        " it was just, he should suffer for his great wrong-doing; it was best for him. Weeks, months even might pass, however my heart might secretly bleed, before my lips should unclose to plead for his pardon; but if refused then, I would openly rebel. I would go to him in the face of authority, and in spite of bolts and bars, though Jasper's self opposed it, I would go. He should not live and die alone, while blood of his- flowed in my veins. I would give up all, every one, to protect and comfort him. I would do this as surely as Christ had died for me I Think not I was insensible to the magnitude, to the dishonor- able nature of his crime, greatly as it was aggravated by ingrati- tude. I am almost afraid to confess, that even after my ears were opened to the details of his former transgressions, this act remained the crowning shame of his life in my estimation. Hor- rors there were, far greater injustice, more outrageous, but nothing before descending to the same type of baseness. I could not, I did not wish, to extenuate his error. It stood out in revolting distinctness before me. But I had pitied and loved him too well to forsake him now. The affection I bore him could not be shaken by sin and shame -it had become one of the pillars of the temple.   , Do not lay down my book-oh I dispassionate reader-in deep disgust at unreasonable sentiments like these. Give vent to your impatience, and then proceed. I think I hear you say: "I am weary of this morbid sacrifice of the noble many to the wicked one. Why should a high-souled woman, a pure and ear- nest man, a youth gifted by nature, warped by human cruelty alone, a girl, gay, ambitious, attractive .perhaps, and full of warm affections, be immured and tortured, for the sake of a reckless vision- ary, who had evidently forfeited his life to the laws of his country.   12    ! THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUV'.IE.            ; "Why should gold, that might have sustained all three in modest plenty, even luxury, be poured into the crucibles of a dreamer, that one useless life might be amused or fed I Is there any jus- tice in this, any fitness, any propriety! Why should one being be : suffered to pursue and trample another into dust, through a whole life, if not to revive the old belief of an evil genius, and to make us doubt the mercy, nay the very existence, of a just God I Why should" Pause here, dear reader, you are becoming excited; or, if you will continue, "Strike, but hear me!" I should be sorry to part with you before the conclusion of my simple narrative, so bear with me, I pray you, as patiently as you may, and think, oh, think, of the motive I In the great hand of the Father, when the balance of good and evil is finally adjusted, and all finite reasoning is laid at rest forever, which think you will weigh down the scale, motives or deeds? Our best actions fail sometimes; they disappear, they leave no trace, or do injury instead of the good intended; but the motive springs immortal, as soul from body; to dwell with God forever.  What a, noble, tender compassion animated that mournful household of Bouverie I How great, how delicate, how forbear- ing, how Christlike wag their pitying generosity; and if it erred on the merciful side, and carrying indulgence and sorrowful re- spect too far, sacrificed joy, hope, and glory to what might be termed a mere chimera, what then? Were those enthusiasts of virtue less virtuous because they exceeded the common opinion of utilitarianism ; or less worthy of the martyr's crown, than those who have relinquished all for country, creed, or philosophy? i   TIlE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVETRIE.      13 Was this sacrifice any less acceptable to the Reader of all hearts, than if it had been made for a great good, or distin- guished sufferer? I do not pretend to answer these questions of my own asking, nor to claim for myself any portion of the merit, if such there were, thus suggested. Sympathy and impulse guided me alone. Whatever good I did was from affection, not principle, Yet such as it was, and from whatever motive it arose, it has reacted on my life, and been lavishy returned to me, in the strength, the tenderness, and the pity thus roused, in a heart naturally wanting perhaps in these attributes of grace.   "     THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUViEIE. CHAPTER II. THE month was nearly gone-the month, it might be called, of probation--which I had placed as the limit of my silence, on a subject that moved me deeply, and those golden days were come when summer, turning on her reluctant path, like Ruth departing from the field of Boaz, looks, back, and thrills the heart of Autumn with her beauty. There is a bewildering charm in that hazy, Indian summer time to me, which takes me captive, soul and sense, and fills me with a sweet and dreamy enjoyment, not unmixed with melancholy. At no other season, in this favored medium clime of ours, do flowers wear so full and perfect a loveliness, and ever-blooming roses, above all, develop then, with a slow perfection that we seek in vain, even in the balmy days of June. "We shall not have you long," I thought, as I filled my basket with tea roses, from the flower-beds hin front of the house, on one of those gorgeous October mornings of golden beauty, such as Claude Lorraine never painted, nor imagined, peculiar as they are to this peculiar land. "Poor Heliotrope! we have no hot-house for you, and the first frost will blight your abundant bloom, and-stifle your sweet odors forever ; but spring will bring back our roses. "I think I love you more, sweet violet flower, for this rare susceptibility of yours, and he with whom your 'nerve-thrilling perfume,' as he called it, is almost a passion, shall have his fill of it to-day, for the last time perhaps, and know, through you, that he is forgiven, re-   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VERIE.        15 membered by one at least of this sad, strange household of 3Bouverie."  Even as I murmured words like these, a report burst on my ear and'filled the calm, hazy atmosphere, loud, distinct, sonorous as that of a cannon. Again and again did that startling explosion jar and confound my senses. I dropped my flowers. I looked up to see from the safe distance at which I stood from the mansion, the glass dome, that capped the central hall, hurled violently from its position, accompanied by clouds of vapor, and shivered into a thousand fiagments fall headlong to the earth. Z At the same moment, a portion of the front wall of the upper cir- cular hall tumbled forward in a confused mass of stone and mortar, leaving a chasm open to my eye, as I still stood roqted to thapot, thlrough which most of the interior might be distinctly discerned. In that rapid glance of pain and terror, I saw my grandfather's form, erect and pale, leaning against the opposite wall of the apartment, with closed eyes and blood-bedabbled hair. "He is dead," I cried, "dead by his own hand, dead in de- ' spair!" and shrieking wildly, I fled to the house, now ringing with the awful cry of fire. I rushed through the open door of the hall into my grandmother's chamber. It was deserted; the door of the secret door stood open. I turned to ascend it, and met Dr. Quintil, and Jasper, bearing' the insensible form of my grandfather between them, followed by his pallid wife.          -  They passed, as by previous consent, through the large cham- )er, into mine, and laid him on my bed. Even in that moment of consternation, the desire to conceal, to save him from danger, was  the first consideration.  '    '        '   16      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEiKT O My grandmother stood mutely wringing her hands. Dr. Quin. til turned to me. "Everything depends on you, Lilian," he said ; "I must go to the roof with Jasper, and try to extinguish this fire ; keep the door fast. Let no one enter, not even Bianca." And so speaking, he darted away. "Stay-is he dead?"I cried. "Not dead, only stunned; he will revive." "Can nothing be done?"I inquired, murmuring wildly after him ; " you have given us no directions!" "Go back to your post, and be patient. Let nature take her course," he said a little sternly. And he flew, followed by Jasper, up the stairs that led to the sealed chamber, as if his own words had lent him wings. "How heartless his conduct is!"I murmured, as I took my stand by the, bed, on which reposed the still insensible cause of all this disturbance. "What matters the safet6y of the house, ; compared to his? He will die for want of attendance I Ah, me! ! can nothing be done?" And I busied myself in chafing his cold brow and hands with the cologne-water that stood on my toilet- F table-the only remedy at hand.                i "I have his medicine here, Lilian ; I secured it as I passed the  slab on which he keeps it-and when he is able to swallow, I  i shall administer it. It may have efficacy for him, and a crisis approaches."  ; y grandmother spoke with a strange calmness, that irritated  instead of soothing me, excited as I already was.    ,  2 "But suppose he never revives," I rejoined. "What then,   ; grandmother? His pulse is a mere thread-and he looks like a  corpse even now ; something must be done." X, .   ,                    t gi   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.         IT "We have the physician's directions, Lilian, to trust to nature. - The fulfillment of these is easy, and satisfies conscience at least- after all, he is in the hands of God!"                . There was a sad irony in her tones that jarred on every nerve of my brain. "She is willing he should die," I thought; " how horrible I She would do more than ' satisfy conscience,' to save her tortoise- shell cat I Oh, heavens I has it come to this? And he her husband I But I will wrestle for him with death itself," and throwing myself on my knees by his bed. I prayed as I never, prayed before I I prayed with my whole mental and bodily energy, with words of fire, with streaming eyes, with trembling limbs, with dew- covered face, and inward sacrifice I J I rose from my knees both strengthened and exhausted. By this time the house was filled with people, brought together by various motives,curiosity; perhaps, being the predominant one. '  Our nearest neighbors consisted of a class of poor tenantry, who cultivated the vast estate of the "Dugannes," long absent in Europe. The gardener, Smith, and his wife, had, under the pretence of rendering us assistance, brought with them a host of those busy idlers, for such they proved themselves on this occasion. The fire was got under before they arrived, and they might . with propriety have withdrawn again, had not the spirit of pro- crastination and investigation possessed them. The faculty of    .: inquiring into the business of others, does, indeed, seem to be a  - sixth sense with the vulgar, who revive on all possible occasions,    the old inquisitorial torture of the question, with exquisite ima , provements suggested by local circumstances.  'it   18      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. The pyramid of Cheops was not more an object of curiosity to a thorough-going traveller, than was this mysterious mansion to the crowd of long-exiled intruders who filled it now, and who per- sisted in the right of search-a self-constituted police, leaving no cranny unexamined-no- loop without a doubt dangling there- from, in token of their sagacity. We heard the tramp of busy feet passing and repassing-the murmur of suggestive voices; but every effort to enter my chamber (our -only remaining fortress now) was successfully repelled. "You cannot enter, Mrs. Bouverie desires to be alone," was tile only answer I vouchsafed to their urgent and oft-repeated applications for admission--and they were forced to retire dis- contented, and hajhatisfied of what they burned to know. Yet enough was evidenced in these upper rooms, i supposed to be long abandoned (recently inhabited, it was apparent, to the least observing), to confirm those floating suspicions that had long wanted concentration only, and which the dignity arl-treticence of my grandmother's character had hitherto held at bay. Every precaution, suggested by care and interest, became now a fatal witness against us--and when the dead body of poor old Fabius was found, and dragged out by his half-distracted wife from beneath the ruins of the chemical apparatus, and afterward triumphantly borne forth and exhibited by the officious Smith, to the excited crowd, as an evidence of some diabolical instrument- ality at work, and the presence of an unseen, or concealed party, illegally protected in the house of Bouverie, curiosity and conjec- ture threatened to carry everything before them.  It was at the moment that Smith was addressing the crowd, Mark Antony-like, pointing out the ghastly wound on the old !   TIIE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        19 man's head that had killed him-inflicted, probably, by a gas-pipe that had burst beside him, one of the scattered fragments of which J he brandished above his head'--and that Bianca was unconsciously i  lending effect to the scene, by hanging, in wailing agony, over the body of Fabius ; that Dr. Quintil, having finished his work on the !  house-top, stepped quietly in front of Smith, and stood in their ! midst, with that cool and commanding air he knew so well how to sibstitute, at times, for his usually unostentatious demeanor. The expression of his eye seemed to act like a charm on Bianca; her outcries subsided into low, whimpering sighs, and she sat down quietly in a corner, quite out of sight-; while Dr. Quintil, still : standing in front of the "British lion," on the broad steps of en. trance, signified, by an imperative wave of the hand, and the usual preparatory clearing of the throat, common to all unexperienced orators, that he desired to address the audience. tHe was greatly respected among the neighbors -for his manli. ness, and humanity, and spotless integrity of character; and had been frequently solicited (in vain) to fill their magisterial chair. When he commenced to speak to them, therefore, in low but distinct tones, and with the firm manner peculiar to him when aroused to action, they yielded him immediate and respectful at- tention. He told them  that he deplored more than any one could de- plore it, excepting the afflicted wife of the deceased, the fatal accident that a misguided passion for science had occasioned to the poor, faithful old man, whose body they had just beheld. At this moment, Jasper and Pat McCormick were seen quietly   ' lifting up the body of Fabius, assisted by Bianca ; and, in another, they had disappeared within the mansion with their burden, not. withstanding the deprecating growl of the lion. ,                         20      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VElIE. Mfeantime, the American eagle continued to expand his wings before his hereditary foe.                    I "In all times, my friends," he said, "the devotees of science have loved to carry on their experiments in solitude or retirement. For years, the upper story of the house of Bouverie has beehi set apart for purposes like these. Acids and gases have been em- ployed in these labors, requiring the utmost care and precaution on the part of those'who handled them; and, so far, employed without injury or inconvenience to any one. Those only who love chemistry for its own sake, can appreciate the motive of these ex- periments ; it is needless to explain them now. Indeed, at a time like this, and filled, as I am, with horror and regret for the occur- rence of this morning, I do not feel able or willing to enter into unimportant details, however interesting you might find them, for the love of knowledge is common, I well know, to all intelligent minds. "I desire that an inquest be held over the body of Fabius, should you deem this necessary after the haste you have manifested - in removing it from the place in which the investigation should properly h/ve been conducted. I doubt not that he met his     I death from the exploded gas-pipe, a fragment of which "-turning, and taking it from Smith's hands-"I find in opportune readiness for the illustration of my opinion, I think, when you examine his wounds, you will probably agree with me about this; but, should there be a dissenting voice among those appointed to conduct the investigation, I hope I shall hear of it at once, so that no unjust censure may attach to any act of mine. "And now, I will ask you, my friends, having rendered us all the assistance possible under the .circumstances, to withdraw, in accordance with those laws of humanity and delicacy familiar to   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        21 all noble minds, and leave us alone again with our dead and with our ruins. The mistress of this mansion is ill, from distress and horror at the catastrophe which cuts off the life of a faithful ser- vant under peculiar circumstances, which, however accidental, are not, I assure you, unconnected with pain and self-reproach." And here he bowed, and laid his hand on his heart significantly, pausing for a moment in his harangue, as if to fix attention on himself as the delinquent. "I wish, principally on her account, to restore the mansion as speedily as possible to its customary condition of silence and re- pose. Smith will entertain at his cottage those who have so nobly come forward in our cause, with that hospitality and profu- sion no one so well understands as a thorough-bred Englishman, grafted on our American tree. The meansfor this shall not be wanting." And, as he spoke, Dr. Quintil stepped aside, so as to reveal the burly form of the Englishman, who had resolutely kept his ground, and handed him a well-filled pocket-book, amid 'the murmured approbation of the crowd, now moving slowly off. Smith, who had evidently been waiting for his turn to speak, received it sullenly enough, and followed in silence the retreating stream, some loiterers from among which lingered about the pre- mises, either from idleness or design, until nearly sunset. "That speech was terrible work, Jasper," said Dr. Quintil, wiping his excited face, as he drew the ponderous bolt across the door of entrance, and shut out, as he hoped and supposed, all further intrusion. "Terrible work I -I came near breaking down, once or twice, and my brain reeled like that of a drunken man." "You made sad work of figures," wrote Jasper, ' in that last  flight of yours, that daring metaphor-than which nothing since the days of Daphne has ever seemed to me half so miraculous I   22      TTHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUtVEIKIE. Think of grafting poor Smith bodily-turning his own horticultu. ral proficiency against him, and compelling his solid British flesh  i and blood to enter the tough bark of our American tree I By       the by, what peculiar species is that which typifies our country? Did you mean birch, or ash, or hickory, or was it a general hit?" But I am anticipating in telling this piece of folly here, so irrelevant to the crushing circumstances around us, and yet so necessary, perhaps, to sustain those who indulged in it, and which did not reach my ears for days after. While all this speech- making and diplomacy were going on, my grandfather had slowly    1 revived, and recognized the faces bending over him, although still in a state of extreme exhaustion and bewilderment. {' Where am I, Camilla 1" he murmured. "In Lilian's room. A fearful accident has occurred above- stairs-we were obliged to remove you," she replied. "Ay, I know--I know," he said, feebly. "I remember now- failure, destruction, retribution, perhaps, if there is such a thing! God knows!" "Erastus, does your strength return to you!" asked my grand- ,i mother, after a long silence, during which the voices and tread of a retreating crowd came very gratefully on our ears. "Do you  think you could rise, sustain yourself on your feet, walk, even, if  it were necessary? Do you think you could do these?" He replied only by a sorrowful shake of the head. "Here is your elixir, Erastus," she said, extending it to him, speaking still in those measured tones that fell so coldly on my   X ear. "I found it safe in the general ruin around it, and saved it   for you, for an emergency like this. Perhaps it may benefit you,    accustomed, as you are, to its use. Taste it now, for it is all-im.  portant you should rally-a crisis approaches." *              * ' '    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVRIE;.        23. He took the vial from her hand with a sort of spasmodic greediness, and, raising it to his lips, drank a few drops; then, as if changing his mind, waved it away, and turned his head aside: "Why should I care to collect my strength?" he said. "My last experiment, for the sake of which I forfeited so much that was precious to me, is a failure ; and, like poor Keats, -my name shall be 'written in water.' Camilla, let me die I9' "Would that you could, Erastus, for your own sake, and that of all connected with you. But I know too well the tenacity and elasticity of your constitution to hope for such a result. You will revive, but, perhaps, too late to save you from the scaffold." "Of what are you thinking, Camilla? Surely, you would not betray me!"                    J  !"!"There was a world of, scorn in that monosyllabic word, that showed how his question had stung her. "No, no-not that. I do not mean that, of course," he said, embarrassed by his own hasty misconstruction of her meaning. "But why refer at all to so bitter a possibility, Camilla? Why think of it even?" "Probability Hcertainty I say rather, Erastus. Do you not know that the existence of a concealed inmate in the' sealed chambers of Bouverie has been brought to light by the events of this morning? -The house has been full of strange, inquisitive eyes.

I clung to '- him with convulsive sobs, partly of ill-repressed indignation. His weakness seemed my strength. "He shall not go forth alone," I said; ' I will share his exile. I am young, strong, hardy-I will go with you, grandfather, and serve you always, as Fabius did."                 p: "Good child-unmerited devotion --poor, sacrificed old man!" were the broken words I gathered from his grief. "Be calm, Erastus I the circumstances which surround you must be met with calmness," said my grandmother, in her cold, grave tones. "Go, Lilian-you only unnerve him-go, breathe the fresh air, and take needful refreshment, you are pale and ex-  i hausted. Go!" she repeated, seeing that I hesitated, "this is no  K longer a request, but a command, Lilian, necessary for ithe good of all. I insist on obedience.'" I withdrew, chilled and pained by the severity of her manner, i out of keeping, as it seemed to me then, with the sorrow of others, the result, as I now know, of that stringent necessity that 'called for the exercise-of every power she possessed, and nerved her into sternness ax the best defence against despair.            My first thought, on leaving my grand-parents, was of poor Fabius.                               I   THE HOUSEHOLD OF' BOU VERIE.       25 CHAPTER III. I FOUND Bianca sitting alone by her dead husband, in one of the chambers of the wing assigned to their use. The old man looked as if in a happy sleep ; the expression of his face was per- fectly natural-scarcely more imperturbable in death than life. The injury which killed him had been received on the back of the head, and the ceeful hand of affection had effaced all traces of violence. The faithful wife had laid her rosary on his breast, and bound lis nerveless hands with faded ribbons. In his thin white hair she had placed a wreath of everlasting, of gay colors, which I recog- nized as one that had long hung beneath her image of the Virgin. The quaint and unsuitable head-dress was shocking to me ; but, to her, it was only an emblem of future immortality. Two consecrated candles, of white wax, were burning at his head, two were at his feet ; and there he lay, the victim of fidelity I "Oh I God, if this were all 1"--I thought-" if this uncertain life were all, what confidence could we feel in our Creator l Where would be-his justice, his mercy, his affection? The author of this evil lives, and is kindly cared for-his faithful tool lies here a mangled corpse 1" "Poor old man," I pursued aloud, " you are gone where fidelity is rewarded, not despised-gone to the land of peace and compen- sation, where I hope to meet you, gentle Fabius, when this weary pilgrimage is'over, and we are all laid at rest!"My tears bathed his insensible waxen face.

II.-2   26      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.              e "He loved you well, Miss Lilian," said the poor weeping wife ; "next to the master that destroyed him, he loved you ; but those   who serve the Evil One have never a better reward than this I I knew how it would be, long ago. Oh I thl ose diamonds, Miss    # Lilian-it all came of them!

"Bianca, had he never returned, you would not have known your husband. Would you be willing, in order to wipe 6ut your -  sorrow, to give up all memory of Fabius?"  "No, indeed, Miss Lilian, Fabius was the only person that cared for me for myself alone; and these ten years have been    happier to me than all that went before."             l "When did my grandfather first know Fabius, Bianca?"I asked, willing to waive the subject first suggested. "In his boyhood, Miss-Lilian, when he lived with Madam Am-   i brose, his aunt; the master's parents died when he was a baby, I ! have heard, and old Ursa Bouverie and his sister took care of   i him. Fabius was butler to Madam Ambrose. She was a grand     i lady once, though afterward she was reduced, by her husband's fail. ure and death, to keep a young ladies' school for her support ; and he says she was an angel almost, not a bit like any other Bouverie he ever heard of, so between a devil and an angel his chances lay  -the master's I mean." "Go on, Bianca." (She had murmured the last words.) "Yes indeed, Miss Lilian, he was mighty fond of Madam ,   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       27 Ambrose, and lived with her until she died, and then passed into your grandfather's service, and went with him to Russia, and shared his captivity there, as one may say he did here, and wor- shipped him, almost sinfully I think, and always told him so ; for I am sure, Miss Lilian dear, it must be witchcraft, or something like it, that could make anybody love that cruel, crafty, selfish, spiteful man," glancing at me sidewise. "Bianca, have a care!" "I can't help it, Miss Lilian ; a body must' speak sometimes, or die. Oh I my poor, dear Fabius, there you lie-without so much as a priest's blessing, or the comfort of a last confession, and the simple idiot that has not sense enough to hatch a lie, tells us he saw the black spirit flying out of the dome when the ex- plosion took place, with something white in his claws; and I know- I know," sobbing bitterly, "it must have been my poor, doomed husband's soul!" "Bianca, this was a pure invention of that fanciful fool.' There was black smoke and white vapor passing out together, but with- out form or substance ;" and I described the scene as I had wit- nessed it from the lawn, not omitting the appearance of my grandfather, as I had seen him, pale and bloody, leaning against the walls of the rotunda. This account seemed to tranquillize her a little, although she still lent her share of faith to Patrick's relation. She was not the only one who had been mistaken in the opinion, that fools are- not the most prolific, if not the most successful liars. The daring mendacity of persons whose understandings are below mediocrity, and their surprising cunning in sustaining their own fabrications, are -among the few proofs I know of that system of compensation so fondly upheld by certain philosophers.   28      THE HOUSEHOLD OF bOUVERIE. Before I left Bianca, she made me sing to her, a simple hymn, she singularly loved, that I had found, music and words, among my mother's papers, arranged, I have ever believed, by herself. The low, solemn music, the earnest words, seemed to comfort her. I left her somewhat composed, and made my way through the pantry, that communicated between her room and the dining- room, where I supposed by this time-it was now dark-the rup- per might be served. I had eaten nothing since breakfast-time-dinner had been neg- lected in the trouble of that day. The consequences of excite- ment and fasting were beginning to evidence themselves in my giddy head and palpitating heart, and I was glad to find the table spread, and the tea-urn steaming on the lighted board. How material we are, even in our deepest affliction, and how keenly and cunningly the neglected physique resents the slights offered it by the preoccupied spirit I Imagination itself is but a kite, of which the body holds the string, and which an aching finfger, or a dyspeptic attack, or cold, or heat, or hunger, can lay flat on the ground beside us. Shelley -forgot to eat at times, his biographers say, but his body never forgot that it had not eaten, they add, and fainted under the load his mind tried to impose on its injured yoke-mate. But this is no time for disquisition." My grandmother and Dr. Quintil were already seated at the table, when I entered the dining-room, on which Dame McCor- mick, assisted by Patrick, was coarsely and carelessly piling the  viands and breads she had prepared for the evening meal. Fortunately for herself, she could not hear her own noisy   j ministry, but vanishing soon, with a scowl and a harshy-banged door, she left Patrick to complete her disorderly arrangements,    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VE;IE.        29 I sighed as I thought of Fabius, the quiet, the neat-handed, in contrast to all the fuss and folly of his successors, yet could scarcely refrain from smiling the next minute, at the ludicrous awkwardness of Patrick McCormick, and his still more ridiculous self-complacency, as he darted aimlessly to and fro, with officious absurdity. "Where is Jasper?"I asked, as I seated myself at the table, and glanced across it at his empty place. "I have sent him for Bishop Clare," was my grandmother's reply. In the meantime, "Father Conrad, " hearing accidentally of our calamity, at Croften, has been kind enough to come to us in our affliction. I looked in. the direction her eyes suggested, and now perceived, for the first time, that a stranger was! seated in the chimney- corner, in the great old-fashioned chair my grandmother usually occupied.  "This is my granddaughter, Father Conrad," She continued in a mechanical way, adding, as she saw me about to rise and go for- ward to greet the stranger with the reverence due to his vocation, "Sit still, Lilian, for the present. Let Father Conrad rest and warm, and you can persuade him afterward to have a cup of tea." A husky voice from the person alluded to declined the tea em- phatically, and apparently for the second time, and a fit of cough- ing and wheezing succeeded this impatient and spasmodic refusal of tendered hospitality. A -strange, half sad, half amused expression flitted over my grandmother's face, as these uncultured sounds met heifear, then died away again into gloom and dejection. It was indeed almost impossible to look at- the grotesque object   30       THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. before us, without feeling an inclination to smile. Often as Jas- per had alluded to the strange appearance of his old Latin teacher, I was not prepared for anything quite so absurdly ugly as the reality presented; and from the very first I viewed him with instinctive mistrust. From my position at the table, I was able to scrutinize his 'whole appearance, as I sat at supper, and I found myself drawing a slightly ironical comparison between Bishop Clare and his sub- stitute. "Can this old man, after all, be an emissary of Smith?"I thought, as I recalled the accounts I had heard of his mercenary and sensual nature, mixed with a certain kindliness and sagacity that gave him wonderful influence with the lower orders of his countrymen ; or is his errand here truly one of mercy?' "He comes to see about poor Fabius," whispered my grand- mother, as if reading my doubts in my countenance, "perhaps to watch to-night with Bianca ; he means well, we must be civil." All this time I felt that my eyes were fastened, almost as if by fascination, on the uncouth priest, who sat in ai perfectly uncon- cerned attitude, stretching his large feet, covered with coarse, dusty shoes, to meet the warmth of the ruddy fire, and blowing his nose, from time to time, on a great yellow bandanna handker- chief, spotted with red. The association of ideas connected with this stentorian per- formance, would certainly have marred my appetite under other circumstances, but I was absolutely faint from hunger, and could not afford to be fastidious. But I forget; I have not yet described the peculiarities which so attracted, yet repelled me., His head was large and tonsured, and surrounded with a fringe * .I                    -1   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        31 of white hair; his nose, short and thick, and purplish at the end, with open, upturned nostrils, and his cheeks flabby and furrowed. His upper lip was of monstrous length, and his chin of dispro- portionate shortness, while the loss of teeth, indicated by his indistinct and mumbling voice, might have occasioned or greatly increased both of these defects. His stout and round-shouldered figure was arrayed in a priest's long, straight coat, made of some coarse, black material, from the loose sleeves of which his large, ungloved hands protruded. The power and vigor of his native constitution was plainly evidenced by these coarse and blunt ex- tremities, from which the sinews and veins rose like whip-cords, distinctly visible even from a remote seat, and in the uncertain light of an unusually dim lamp and smoldering coal fire. Immediately after supper, Dr. Quintil withdrew, indicating, I thought, by a glance, the necessity of his absence, and its cause, as well as the importance of self-command in our case. My grandmother remained near the table, apparently busying herself with the tea-things, and showing Patrick how to dispose of them, and how to regulate the temperature of the tea-water, which he had brought scalding hot. I rose to assist her, as I usually did. "I would prefer,"' she whispered, " that you would talk to the old man; I cannot make the effort to-night. Engage his atten- tion if possible. Perhaps after a while he may go to Bianca's room." "God speed him 1" was my mental rejoinder, as I took a chair near him, and prepared to obey my grandmother's request, with a heavy and reluctant heart. "You have had a long, fatiguing walk, Father Conrad," I said, " that is, if you came from Croften on foot," and I glanced   32      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VSEIE. at his dusty shoes, as evidences of the correctness of my supposi- tion. "I am sorry it did not give you a better appetite for your supper.7" "My cough troubles me, my daughter," was the wheezing reply, enlivened with an Irish brogue, of the most unipleasant description-that which contracts instead of broadening the vowels. "I am abut poorly jist now; besides I had a cr t of bread in my pocket, lift from my breakfist, and there were wild greepes on the road, and the two formed a repast fit for a moin- arch-if monarchs could only think so," laughing low at this sotto voce reflection of his, "and surely good enough for a poor anchorite like myself." "I should call that very poor living, Father Conrad," and I recalled with a smile Jasper's account of his voracity and gourmandise. {' Why, the birds fare as well! I had no idea that your religion helped to sustain the body as well as the soul." "Oh, it does wonders, my dear," he replied; and again he laughed that little, low, wheezing laugh, that jarred me into silence again. "I am talking nonsense," I thought, " and the old man sees my object perhaps. What shall I say to him? - Good heavens, will he never go I Oh, if -Bianca would but send for him. I feel, I feel more and more convinced he is here for no good purpose." As I recovered from my conflict of feeling, and prepared to renew my efforts to entertain him, I looked up, and caught, through the blue, iron-rimmed glasses he wore, the gleam of his deep, dark eye, fixed suspiciously on me. It was averted in a moment. ,   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        33 "Would you like to look at the newspapers, Father Conrad?" I asked, thrilled and terrified even by his furtive vigilance, and utterly at a loss for subjects of conversation; "if so, I will fetch them to you, and place candles beside you." "No, my dear, it is not worth while to trouble you," was his indifferent rejoinder; ' my eyes are weak, I seldom use them by night, except when I read my Vulgate ; and, at the bist of times, newspeepers are bothersome things to me. I am a man of peace, you know; and the poleetical and releegious squabbles of the world in no wise intreest me, taken up as I am with one great considera- tion alone." "I suppose you admired the comet very much, Father Conrad, as a part of religion even," I observed, driven to desperation for a theme of conversation, after another hiatus in the -dialogue, during which I caught again that furtive, momentary glance darted at me, and then withdrawn. "Even we poor worldly-minded people were much impressed," I added, shivering almost with the unde- fined apprehensions that oppressed me in connection with this unbidden guest. "Yes, my dear,"' was the careless answer, "I may say I ad- mired that nebulous body you call a comet, as one might admire a fixed rocket, which it greatly resimbled; but you are mistaken about my releegious feeling connected with such a mere matter of moonshine as that. It is the inner, and not the outer, heaven that concerns an anointed priest of God." I was quite silent, with mingled disgust and conjecture, when he relieved me somewhat by requesting me to shade the lamp- dim enough before, I thought, in the absence of the skillful hand of Fabius-- as his eyes were weak. "And tnow bring me yonder footstool, my dear," he continued, 2*    34       THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. when I had placed the green reading-shade over the lamp, and again approached him, and he pointed to one of embroidered vel- vet, on which he soon proceeded to place his clumsy, dusty feet. "There, that is quite comfortable; now you may join your mother, and help in the dish washing, if you choose, for, with your permeesion, I will settle down for a little nap. The old man is tired." "And infinitely tiresome," I thought, as I withdrew, thus sum- marily dismissed from further attendance on the greatest bore I had ever encountered. I could not repress a laugh, however, as I 'turned a moment later to look at him, and saw that he had spread the yellow bandanna over his head, as if to insure a more quiet enjoyment of his repose, while his head bobbed about like a buoy at sea. "Lilian," my grandmother said, in a low voice, "my expecta- tions are more than realized by the occurrences of the last hour. Either your grandfather is beyond " She was interrupted by a loud and sudden knocking at the front door. The words died on her lips, and the half-smile from hoc face, now blanched with terror. "I knew it would be thus," she whispered, hoarsely; "the officers are here!"' - Again the loud impatient knocking was heard without, accom- panied now by voices, among which we distinguished that of Dr. Quintilian. "Patrick, open the door," said my grandmother. "Lilian, be firm--our trust is in God."           o G She dashed the tears from her eyes with a rapid motion of her hand, and, with that surprising self-control that belonged to her, busied herself with apparent unconcern in wiping the tea-cup she   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.         35 held; but still the deadly pallor continued, and still the old man slept on. "He is their accomplice," I murmured; "I am sure of it now -this slumber is but feigned, he will wake presently. Thank God I the spy has learned little to report." By this time footsteps were in the hall. In another moment, the door of the dining-room was thrown wide open, and Dr. Quintil entered, pale, but resolute; and fixing his grave eyes on my grandmother's face, seemed by their expression to exhort her to be calm. Two men followed almost immediately on his steps, dressed in rough coats and slouched hats, and carrying riding- whips in their hands. They bowed, as they came in, but did not uncover their heads, and stood stolidly waiting for Dr. Quintil to announce their errand. "These gentlemen," he said, addressing my grandmother, and laying an involuntary stress on the word so misapplied, "bear a judicial order for the arrest of your late husband, Erastus Bou- verie. The opinion seems to have obtained ground that he still survives. ' They demand to search your premises." She smiled a cold, derisive smile, and her cheek, until then so pale, flushed again in the fullness of her wounded pride, and the strong effort she was making to command her feelings. Yet she replied, after a moment's hesitation, still continuing her occupa, tion, as if indifferent to their presence : "Let them proceed to their task at once, if it needs must be," and with a stately, yet not uncourteous, gesture of the hand, she indicated the direction they should take. They seemed to be involuntarily impressed by her mien, her manner, her beauty, perhaps, still so remarkable, and which claims, wherever it exists, so large and unjust a share of man's   36      THE HOUSEROLD OF BOUVERIE. respect. They removed their hats simultaneously; and one of them, the leader, stepping back as they were about to leave the room, in a rough but manly voice made a half apology for his proceedings: "We have come, madam, to fulfill the law, not to trouble you and yours," and he glanced at me, trembling and tearful as I was. "This is a notion your gardener, Smith, has set afloat; but no sensible man puts much faith in it. Facts are still fresh in this, neighborhood, about Colonel Bouverie's suicide; but, you know, as the warrant is out, we must proceed, and plant guard over the house until it is satisfied." As he spoke, he surveyet her keenly, hoping, perhaps, to gather something to aid his investigation from her face or manner. "Certainly," she replied, returning his glance calmly, and even haughtily. "I understand all this--you are but an irresponsible instrument of the law; proceed, but get through, I beg, arsoon as possible. I confess the matter annoys me," and she resumed her occupation, that of wiping a small china cup, with a cool in- difference that surprised and almost shocked me--knowing, as I did, how much she was perplexed and agitated-and completely deceived him, I think." As Dr. Quintil closed the door after the officers, the cup shivered in her grasp, and blood flowed from  the lacerated fingers that had closed over it with such spasmodic strength. And still the priest slept on his real or simulated slumber. "Oh, would that he were gone!"I whispered, as I bound her hand with fragments of my handkerchief. "Let us arouse him ; andsend him to Bianca!" "Not yet," she replied, in low  accents; " not yet; but, Lilian, can it be possible that you are in earnest, in making such   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE o       37 a suggestion? Do you not know every outlet, even that to the pantry, is guarded now?" "My grandfather," I whispered; "what of him? has he escaped-or will they apprehend him?" "God knows, my child, what his fate may be," she murmured softly-then gazing wistfully in my face, she added: "You give me reason to hope that all may yet go well with him. I could not have believed it before." "You speak in enigmas, grandmother-explain yourself." "Hush, Lilian, he will hear you. Let us be silent, my love- guarded for the present. There are watchful eyes and ears about us; come, assist me to put away the tea-service--the task will compose us both, and when they return, it will be best they should find us occupied. The minutes rolled heavily away-ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty- five were gone, and in five more, just as the clock struck the half-hour after eight, the officers reappeared, headed as before, b)y Dr. Quintil. "There are traces of recent occupancy in those upper apart- meants, long supposed to be disused," said Hernshaw, the principal officer ; " but we find no occupant." "Wliat traces do you speak of?" asked my grandmother, sharply ;" you found bedding stored there for safe-keeping-a chest of clothes belonging to Colonel Bouverie,; in old times-and whatever the fire has -spared of furniture and cabinets deposited there in memory of the past. You have found neither linen nor papers to warrant you in the belief of recent occupancy ; and Dr. Quintil has sufficiently explained to you, I cannot doubt, the facts connected with the chemical apparatus, to convince you that our safety was concerned, in banishing that to the upper story+   38      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. ' She had, indeed, used well the few hours of privacy she had obtained that day, in causing the personal effects of my grand- father, those in constant use, to be destroyed or effectually con- cealed, so as to give his chambers the appearance of long-deserted premises. But as a small leak -will admit the sea into the doomed vessel and sink it--so had one oversight on her parLt, confounded all her caution.  A pair of gloves had been dropped in his hasty flight, and of these Hernshaw had possessed himself. Worse than all, with the exquisite care and detail my grandfather bestowed on every object around him, he had written his name on the lining, with the date of the present year. It was his fancy to do things in this way, and his habit in cold weather to wear kid-gloves, when reading, or handling metallic-instruments, that chilled his sensitive frame. From his capacious pocket Hernshaw now drew these gloves, and coolly, without remark, held up the signature and date for my grandmother's observation. He had struck the mark this time--she trembled and grew pale; falsehood was not her element, she was silent, and con- founded by this slight circumstance. "It is probable," he said, " from all that I can ascertain, that your charge, whosoever he be, has escaped, and I must be moving off in brisk pursuit; but before I go I have still one duty to perform. Who," and he turned curiously to the object of his investigation-still glancing furtively at my grandmother across his shoulder with evident suspicion. "Who is that old man sleeping by the fire?t The question seemed to arouse her to strength and indignation even. "Ie calls himself Father Conrad, a stranger, so far to me an   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        39 intruder even,' she replied, in rapid and haughty accents. "His errand here is one of mercy to our afflicted servant, and duty to the dead. I have no more to say about him; examine him if you like-what remains, you can find out for yourself." Hernshaw seemed baffled again-he had evidently counted on some discovery in that quarter, aided by the abruptness of his onset. He -stood for a moment evidently -disconcerted by her manner. "I have heard of Father Conrad-but I have never seen him," he remarked, at last. "'Here, Clements," and he turned to his more silent and retiring comrade. "Come forward, and identify this man ; you know the father!" At this moment, as if to assist their investigation, Father Conrad stirred in his sleep. His head dropped forward ion his breast, and the bandanna slipping from   its place as a veil, assumed the position of apron, -and fell over his knees, leaving the tonsured head and ludicrously homely face, with its hanging underlip, fully exposed to view. "This certainly is Father Conrad!" said Clements, approach- inag him cautiously, and punching the smoldering coal-fire into a momentary bituminous blaze, so as to obtain a better light for his investigation: "Father Conrad, by all that's holy!" he) reiterated ; "and yet," he added, in subdued tones, "I could have sworn I saw him starting off in the Mapleton coach from Croften, at five o'clock this afternoon. It beats the bees!"' "The convent lies on that route, you know," interposed Dr. Quintir; "he must have received intimation of our necessity before he arrived there-and changing his mind, turned on his path.  He is evidently travel-worn." Clements glanced at his dusty shoes.!"He sleeps as if he was   40      THE HOUSfEHOLD OF BOrVERIE. either drunk or very tired," he muttered ; but Hernshaw stirring the sleeper rudely with the butt-end of his riding-whip, said in a loud, authoritative voice, which cut short all further temporizing : "Rouse up, old man, and speak for yourself I How do you reconcile these points? Explain quickly-I must be going--how was it; how was it, Father Conrad?" "I cannot go," said the priest, muttering in his disturbed slumber. "I tell you it is too far to walk to Bouverie this evening." "Wake up, I am in a hurry, I tell iou," said Hernshaw, laning his hand on the priest's shoulder, and shaking him slightly. "Come, give a satisfactory account of yourself-or prepare to go with us." "Are you riding, gentlemen?" inquired the old man, straight- ening himself in his chair, and adjusting his spectacles, with the air of one just roused to a clear sense of his situation. "If so, I will be glad of a lift to Croften ; I am foot-sore and fairly broke down, and have been sleeping in my chair, I believe; but I forget-I must attend to my little beesness here first ; perhaps you could wait for me an hour or so, to obleege me?" While the priest spoke he grasped his yellow bandanna in his   I great shrivelled hands, and looked steadily at the officer. "I am glad of this delay," I thought; " it will give my grand- father more time to elude his pursuers. With God's help, he will  reach St. Stephen s before morning--and once there, Bishop Clare' will protect him with his life."  A brief murmured consultation was going on between the      j officers, while these thoughts passed through my mind, which  ended in Hernshaw's turning respectfully to my grandmother, and signifying his intention to depart. '    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        41 "Clements will go at once to the convent," he said, " and un- derstand the cause of Father Conrad's mission here, as some doubt seems attached to it. Until this matter is made clear, we must plant a guard over your house, as well as to prevent the return of the fugitive. At daylight, or as soon as his apprehen- sion is certain, your premises will be vacated; but I hope, truly, madam," he added, with a tone of courtesy in his voice, "'that nothing will occur to distress you further under your own roof." He withdrew, followed by Clements, and a few moments later the closing of the hall-door, and the drawing of the ponderous bolt across its leaves by Dr. Quintil's hand, announced their final departure for that night; but we knew that armed sentinels paced the pavement in every direction, and guarded every avenue of egress from Bouverie. "Oh, what shall be done, Paul? said my grandmother, as Dr. Quintil reentered the apartment, and she threw herself wildly back in her chair, as though, after the miserable nerve tension of the last hour, she could no longer restrain her feelings, even in sight of the dozing priest, half-conscious witness as he was of her proceedings. "Where shall we turn? We cannot save him now-flight is impossible." Dr. Quintil made no reply; but proceeded at once to bolt and lock all doors leading from the dining-room, first' stepping into the pantry to secure that of the outer-court; after which he threw up the sashes to try the fastenings of the shutters, and drawing these down again, examined the catches above them which held them firmly in their place. "Lend me your pin-cushion, Lilian," he said; and, on receiving it, he proceeded to mount on a chair, and lap across, and pin   42       THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. together, with the utmost precision, the plush-lined damask' cur- tains from a point as high as he. could reach above him to the floor below; after effecting which, he turned to us with something like satisfaction in Iris countenance. "We are free from all possible external observation, now, at least," he said, "and we have breathing-time; this much we have accomplished--this much, if no more."  "Oh, Quintil, I am in despair! there is no hope-none-he must be apprehended." "Grandmother, remember hle may hear you," and I pointed to Father Conrad, who again sat gently nodding in his chair. "I thought the priest was to go to Bianca? why this delay? They will certainly permit him to pass to her room under escort?" "It matters little, child, who hears me nowl At daylight tho officers will return, and the desperate game be over. All is lost, unless he escapes to-night!" "Can it be that he is still concealed at Bouverie?"I asked, with eagerness. "I thought he was safe-I thought you inti- mated as much before the officers came in; I supposed, hhia beyond these walls at least, on his way to Bishop Clare, perhaps; and I trembled, lest riding in the same direction, they might over- take him." "No, no, Lilian, he was too weak to hazard this--too weak to walk-to stand, even; but can you be serious, Lilian? Have you suspected nothing? And she rose, and stood eagerly before me. "What, grandmother?" In another moment she stood behind the father, and unfastened, as one might do a child's pinafore, the clasp that held on the singular vizor he wore.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.         43 "No exclamations, Lilian!" she said, as she held up before me the gutta-percha mask-face, tonsured head, wig, spectacles, and all, in one piece-revealing, as she did so, the closely-cut, steel grey hair and refined features of my grandfather composed in deep sleep beneath. "Oh,wonderful 1-was ever disguise like this?"I could not help saying aloud, as I gazed with uplifted hands on the totally un- expected revelation before me. "Was ever character so sustained?" added Dr. Quintil. "He sleeps profoundly at last!-he is so sick-so feeble!" my grandmother said, laying the mask aside, and gazing on his face with deep solicitude. "Let him find repose while he can, in every interval of danger or distress I Unrest enough there is in store for him. Oh, Quintil, what trials lie before him I God pity us all, if, indeed, as I have thought sometimes," (she murmured the conclusion of the sentence,) "he has not utterly withdrawn from us." "He is better," said Dr. Quintil, coming forward, and gazing earnestly on his fixed, sleeping countenance, "much better I His wonderful recuperative powers have come to his assistance, and we have reason to hope that he may yet be able to effect his escape before the return of Hernshaw." "Not with that armed police without, Quintil I No, Paul, he is doomed I The bolt so long suspended falls at last, and we are crushed." "I can hear the steps of the watch on the pavement without," I said; "may they not hear our voices as well, and learn our pro- codings thus? May they not; having knowledge of these; force an entrance even?" "The entrance could only be made by violence," said Dr. Quinti),   "      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BO U V EIE. "our voices they cannot hear beyond an inarticulate murmur-- I have ascertained this already by experiment ; and, for the first man who lays-a hand on any inmate of Bouverie, I have this in readiness." And the man of peace drew from his bosom a deadly weapon-- then recently perfected,- I believe, since commonly known as a re- volver-with an expression of face that indicated sufficiently his determination to test its powers, if needful. He had purchased it when Smith commenced his system of an- noyance, and had become a proficient in its use. The gutta- percha disguise had also been provided at this period, with refer- ence to the plan of securing Bishop Clare's assistance, should our flight to Italy be determined on as a measure of security from Smith's persecutions. It was supposed that, as Father Conrad, my grandfather could gain the sea-coast unmolested, and, dropping his disguise there, proceed unquestioned with his family. It was with the hope that through his agency this might still be effected, that Jasper had been sent to Bishop Clare, with the request that the real Father Conrad might be immured for a few days in the walls of St. Stephen's. It has been seen how this plan failed. A mask which Jasper had prevailed on his old Latin teacher to permit him to mold in plaster of Paris, intending it, as he did, for a study of Silenus, had served as the model for this disguise. Dr. Quintil had carefully superintended the coloring and accesso- ries of the face in a distant city, and with such success that the German notion of the " double" might have been impressed on the father himself, could he have seen his effigy. There never was anything so life-like as this imitation. Even in daylight the practised eye could scarcely have detected aught unnatural. The   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BO U VERIE.        45 very hands of the coarse old man were imitated in gloves of gutta percha-a material then little known-to perfection, and the making up of the figure was also strictly accurate. My grand- father had known Father Conrad from his boyhood, and had suc- cessfully imitated his peculiarities a thousand times before he ever dreamed of making these available for his own safety. Such is the history of this transaction, in which a philosopher so sUccess- fully played the mimic, and which, improbable as it seems, is sur- passed every day in common masquerade. But my digression lengthens. I forget the anxious group left standing all this time around the chair of a calm sleeper in the dining-room at Bouverie. I forget that the reader forms one of these. Suddenly the actor starts to his feet, throws off the cumbrous coat, with its manifold stuffings, that concealed his slender figure, and, with the flashing eye, and brilliant smile, that betrayed his simulated slumber, stands erect, elastic, in his strange mixture of youth and age, before their astonished gaze: 5, Uprose the Dervish with that burst of light, Not less his change of form appalled the sight; Uprose that Dervish, not in saintly garb, But like a warrior bounding on his barb." "Yes," he said, "you are right, Quintil, I have marvellous recuperative powers, thanks to a medicine worth more than 'your whole pharmacopoeia, and in spite of vigilance and debility, I will go forth this night, and elude pursuit and vengeance.

He laughed ; in another moment deep gloom covered his countenance. "A truce with this nonsense, dearest, we must part I It wears on to ten o'clock, I see by this timepiece.

She folded hers, and turned weeping away in silence. "Will you not speak to me, Cami'lla, even to wish me well, on this last, last occasion; perhaps--God only knows-we may never meet again, Camilla?  It might be a satisfaction to you to remember that we parted friends." He paused, waiting vainly for a reply. "Go then," he said, "in mercy go," seeing that she remained implacable, yet deeply afflicted. "Do not unman me now, unless indeed you wish that the hangman's  hand should nestle here' And he grasped his slender throat with a bitter laugh.

As for the four trampers without, they do not cost me the shadow of an anxiety.' And as he spoke, he waved his hand toward the hall door, as if dispelling a mere figment of the imagination, adding, with a laugh: "We shall know how to deal with them, eh, Quintil?"   a8      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. CHAPTER IV. WE left him, in what anguish of heart can better be conjec- tured than described. Yet we knew that the desperate course before him, whatever it might be, was the only one that remained for him to adopt. The fear of bloodshed was uppermost with me. I listened through the night for those sounds of conflict and strife, that I feared must usher in any attempt of his to leave the mansion. But all was quiet, and in the morning we heard with great relief that he was gone. Dr. Quintil told us afterward, that on Hernshaw's reappearance at daylight, the men he had left in charge of the house presented themselves before him, with some improbable story of having been beguiled into a cellar by an old, deaf woman, who offered them hot coffee, "just at the cold turn of the night," as one of them expressed it, and confessed that one after the other they had availed themselves of her offer, and afterward fallen asleep, each at his separate post, feeling very "strange and drowsy like ;" "but the truth is, I imagine," said Dr. Quintil, with a quaint smile, "the wretches were probably drunk, and in order to shield themselves, assigned to Dame McCormick a part she had scarcely sagacity enough to play, that of a siren and skillful chemist." "But you know all about it," said my grandmother; '"you can tell us exactly how it was, if you choose." "It is one of those mysteries that can never be cleared up," said Dr. Quintil gravely, "but certainly preferable to bloodshed   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. -49 in any case. Mr. Bouverie had possessed himself of my pistol, and could not have been deterred from using it, had not pacific measures been adopted. Jasper will probably bring us informa- tion on his return of his safety." In this hope the day wore on. In the evening Jasper came, bringing back the letter my grandmother had written. to Bishop Clare-the news of whose absence from home fell like lead on our hearts. He had waited for Bianca, who had gone to St. Stephen's; early in the morning, for the purpose of interring Fabius-and whose nervous condition required assistance-and as "Violet Fane " was lame from over-exertion, he had left her in Croften, and taken his place by Bianca's side in the returning vehicle, in which Pat McCormick had driven her away in the morning. "And where is Pat?" asked my grandmother. "Did he not return with you?"  "I am sorry to say," wrote Jasper; " that Hernshaw, with a sagacity worthy of a better cqause, has possessed himself of this knavish fool. This evening, when we reached Croften, we found him waiting for us, evidently. He took Patrick aside in my absence, and I have little doubt bribed him to undertake the part of guide to ,a party of scouts, going out in, search of Mister Bouverie. I did not know of this at the time, having stopped to; speak with Father Conrad, who had Just returned in the, Maple- ton stage-and to explain to him as well as I could, the necessity of his silence in this matter. "When I approached the buggy (having by this time determined to take my place in it, and make Pat stay at Croften with Violet Fane, until I could return for her, or he could lead her home) he  had disappeared; oit not without remonstrance from Bianca.,r 3   50      THE HOUSEHOLD CO  BOUVERIE. She had urged him not to accompany Hernshaw, threatening, and dissuading him by turns from pursuing this treacherous course, and for all answer, he had rolled his goggle eyes at her- and drawing from his bosom a worn red morocco ball (attached - lo his neck by a leather guard-chain) he had pressed it reverently to his lips-then dropped it back into its hiding-place. She does not know what to make of this piece of tom-foolery ; nor do I." "To me, it gives some faint re-assurance," I said; and I related as briefly as I could the occurrences connected with the '"Bible-ball," as he had called my " lively bouncer," the subject of such ardent admiration on his part. But for my knowledge of his avarice and- hoarding propensities, I should have wondered at the preservation of the plaything he had coveted-a mere relic now of childish tastes. Alas! these very qualities aroused equal anxiety as to the motives which had influenced him to follow Hernshaw. What dependence, after all, could be placed on the consistency of this poor half-saved creature? what reasonable hope based on his fidelity? My strongest trust in his failure to identify him, grew out of the reflection, that he had seen my grandfather, both imper- fectly and casually; but this, after all; was a slender hope, on which to hang so important an issue. "I will go mysqlf, said Dr. Quintil, this very night to St. Stephen's (perhaps much further) and ascertain the truth, if pos- sible. Have the horse you drove fed and watered, Jasper-or, do it yourself, my boy, in the absence of all assistance-and hitch him to the buggy. Bid Dame McCormick give us an early supper, and I will go to Croften before bed-time, and reach St. Stephen's before midnight. I cannot doubt that Mr. Bouverie is there.

If not, I must as- sist him as well as I can to make his way to. the nearest seaport, and, in anticipation of such a necessity, put me up a valise full of linen, Lilian, love, both for myself and him 1" The needful arrangements were made as speedily as possible, and in the twilight Dr. Quintil departed, cheering us to the last with hopeful suggestions, and sanguine anticipations ; yet, leaving us, after all, infinitely dispirited and depressed, as we looked in the face the array of facts before us. The conduct of Pat McCormick (poor idiot as he was) was the last drop that made our cup run over-for he formed, after all, an integral part of our isolated household, and was bound' to us by every tie of gratitude and long association, if not of affection. It was vain, however, in the extreme deafness of the dame, and our own helplessness in this case, to lift up our voices and reveal his treachery and our- suspicions. Strangely enough, she did not seem to miss him, and we came to a half-conclusion, that she was not unacquainted with his proceedings. "I never liked her," said my grandmother, " sheis intimately connected with my sorrow and early wrong, yet I did believe she would die a martyrs death rather than lend herself to injure a Bouverie, one of a race she idolized." We were surprised to see Dr. Quintil alight from the buggy he had driven away, two days after his departure ; still more surprised to see that he was accompanied by Patrick McCormick, who, in his usual capacity of hostler, took charge of the horse at once, and disappearedhto the region of the stables, as if nothing had occurred to interrupt the customary discharge of his duties.   52      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. Dr. Quintil could give us-no satisfaction on the subject ever present to our thoughts. Mr. Bouverie had not reached the house of Bishop Clare, whose absence it was now ascertained would be of some weeks' duration, nor had he been heard of or seen by any one able or willing to impart such knowledge, or of whom such inquiry could with propriety be made. The police, still scouring the country, had failed to discover any traces of his presence, and had dropped Pat McCormick as an incumbrance, after having been misled by him in several instances, and even lost in the paupau jungle for a whole day, time of course irretrievably wasted. So, whether intentionally or not, Patrick had been of service to us it seemed ; and as responsibility seemed out of the question in his case, it wais thought best to make no allusion to the past, and suffer him to fall into the estab- lished routine of duty again without remark. "I found him at Croften on my return," said Dr. Quintil, "Iounging by the tavern pump, with the usual expression of vacuity on his face, which gave way to something like pleasure when he saw me approaching. Without any explanation of his conduct (poor wretch, could he make one were he to try?) he advanced and loosened the reins of my horse, and gave him water; then came to me, with a proposition to drive me home, as his 'mammy' would be wanting him he reckoned, and maybe 'Miss Lilian.' "I did not question him then, but as soon as we left Croften, I plied him as skillfully as I knew how, with all manner of interroga- tories. To not one of these did I receive anything like a satisfactory or direct answer; and yet the impression is strong in my mind that he had seen Mr. Bouverie, and knows perhaps,the place of his con- cealment. But, after all, I may be mistaken in my notion of his instinctive fidelity. I find myself catching at straws all the time.?   THE HOUSEHOLI: OF BOIVERBIE,.

Thisiss but the end of the beginfing F7 "I will try my skill as inquisitor," I thought, as after this con- versation I left the room in search of Patrick, by this time released from his stable duties, and probably subsiding into his softer vocation of kitchen help or scullion. I was not incorrect in my estimate- of time and occupation as applied to him. I found him seated by the kitchen hearth, eating a late breakfast (it was almost our dinner-time), which he was bedewing or rather salting with his tears. He dried his red, preposterous eyes with the corner of a blue rag, protruding from his pocket, as he saw me standing before him, and attempted to rise, still clasping, his plate on his knees. "Sit down, Pat," I said, " as you are eating, and never mind your bow this time." tie obeyed me silently, while the dame, whose back was turned to me, and who was unconscious of my presence, continued to blaze away at him, while she washed her potatoes.

Now mind, Pat McCormick, what I have said t) you this day, for it isn't after repaiting it I'll be, in any way but one. Do you see this?" and she drew from the fireplace a red-hot rod of iron she had been heating there, the remains of a poker 'probably, and turned holding it in her hand in a menacing attitude toward her delinquent kinsman. Poor Pat crouched.  "Oh  don't, mammy, don't,"  he howled, upsetting his precious plate in his terror, and breaking it on the hearthstone, then clinging wildly to me. "Oh, it is you, Miss TLilian!" said the hag, in a deprecating way. "I have to settle with Pat, you see, for moving off without lave or license, you know; and me without a sowl to split a stick of wood for me, or scratch a potatoe for two long days I If the misthress don't take him in hand, I must,' and she turned away, again muttering, to her kitchen table and vegetable duties. I took advantage of this cessation of hostilities to open my negotiation with Pat, now dolefully collecting his scattered breakfast from the hearthstone, with the aid of a scoop made of one hand, and the largest fragment of his coarse, blue-edged, plate, and blubbering woefully as he gathered up his food. "Don't cry, Pat, it isn't manly," I said; "you know you are a policeman now. Didn't you go out with Hernshaw?" A pawky smile flitted over his purple countenance, and the blue rag was again in requisition. "Any way, I comed back without him, if I did follow after him a while," he replied, in an apologetic tone.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VaEit.       55 "I know that," I said, "and we are all glad to get you back again. But, Pat, where did you leave the master? You under- stand me, Pat-the pretty old play-actor man you told me about once, that lived up-stairs?" I waited breathlessly for his long delayed reply. "What would you give me to tell you?" he asked at last, wall- ing his eyes at me awfully, after a solemn pause, and afterward standing perfectly mute before me, with his hands 'clasped, and those animated gooseberries of his fixed hypocritically on the floor.  "Oh, anything, Pat- -anything in the world-just name your price," I answered, eagerly. "There is a heap of things you wouldn't give me to save life ; you just talk this way, Miss lilian, to fool me, 'cause everybody calls me simple, but my pay has to come first." "Certainly, Pat, certainly," I broke in, all impatience. "Just say what you require, and I think I can promise it shall be youls." "Will you give me the picture that hangs over your bed, of the old saint-laqy?" he asked, in solemn accents, glancing at me slily. He alluded to the portrait of my Grandmother De Courcy, I knew. "Anything else, Pat-anything else." "Will you give me your little chest, made of the blessed cedar lined with white velvet, and full of pretty things?"  "Pat, is there nothing else you want? and how on earth do you. see these things?" "I bores holes in the window shutters, and peeps of nights, when the. candles are burning, and I sees everything," said the wretch, with a leering self-complacency. "But I know'd you was   lii   .   BTHE HOUSEHOLD OF BO u VEtIE. only fooling ine, Miss Lilian--I know'd that, all the time l" And he shook his head drearily. "No, Pat, I was not fooling you, nor thinking of such baseness, but you ask impossible things; think of something else," I said, suppressing, as well as I could; my impatience, and 'my feeling of intense provocation. "That little ring on your finger will do me to put on my guard-. chain," he said, pointing to the leather string, around his neck, and eyeing invidiously the emerald hoop Jasper had given me re- cently, while he smiled furtively-perhaps at the certainty he felt that I would refuse him again. "I must make my own terms with you, Pat, I see," I answered, provoked almost beyond endurance; " you are too exacting. See here, you shall have this crimson scarf," unwinding one from my neck, "and a new breastpin, and a silk pocket-handkerchief for Sundays, and a great picture-book, full of saints and martyrs, and a whole box of raisins out of the store-room, and money as well, if you will only tell me, Pat-and cross your heart for the truth- where you left my precious grandfather!" He hesitated.  I thought his avarice would overcome his fear of the dame, and waited anxiously for his decision. "Will you let me kiss your foot besides, if I tell you what I know, Miss Lilian?" asked the wretch, with imperturbable gravity. Had he said my hand, I think I would have consented, in the agony of my anxiety.  What was there, after all, more than the hand-licking of a dog, in this whim of an idiot-scarcely a human being? "Tell me first, Pat," I said, faintly. "A  bargain's a bargain, and as good for me as for you--you want to fool me again. I know'd you did, all the time 1"   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEiE.        57 "I will go and get you all I promised, and return," I said, knowing the matters mentioned were at hand. "Be prepared to tell me the truth-nothing else will answer. Stay here' until I come again-I shall be back soon," and I turned from him. "I will trust you for them articles, Miss Lilian, and tell you all I know now, if you will let me kiss your foot, before you go. Mammy says to kiss a lady's slipper, with her foot in it, cures the ring-worm," and the monster grinned, pointing, at the same time, to a round red blotch on his chin. "There, then!"-I said, extending my foot impatiently; "make haste, and tell me everything." He knelt down, and, after putting his hands for a moment to his eyes, and mumbling a few unintelligible words, he extended them like wings, in the most ludicrously provoking manner, and, bending over it, kissed my foot as reverently as if it had been a saint's relic. "Speak, speak!' I said, stamping impatiently, "as he delibe- rately rose, and stood before me; "Tell me all younknow of the absent-come, Pat, begin.  Where is my dear grandfather?" How I loathed the wretch by this time! "I never knowrd you had one," he replied, with that peculiar drawl of his, assumed, I believe, in his idiotic cunning, whenever it answered his purpose best, at the same time glaring upon me,  with his vacant eyes, like some bewildered, owl just brought out of darkness. "Tell me whatever you know," I rejoined, commanding myself as well as I could, "about the old play-actor man that lived up, stairs-the man that wore the crimson gown, that you took for, the Pope-don't you remember, Pat?   The man you went with Hernshaw to catch? You saw him, Pat, face to face-I know / 3*   58      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERTE. you did-where is he? Speak, boy, speak 1" and, as I saw the stolid shadow deepening over his imbecile face, as if what little intellect he had was creeping or being driven out of sight, the provocation of the moment, and the wish to rouse him up to reply to me, caused me to. seize his shoulder, and shake him sharply. He uttered a hideous cry--such a cry as-a sloth might render forth, when, swinging slowly from limb to limb of a Brazilian forest, the apprehending hand of the traveller is suddenly laid upon him-a cry of mingled fear, and helplessness, and defiance-not of pain. The shrill and unnatural sound pierced the dull ear of Daine McCormick ; she turned full upon me just as I was putting forth my hand to grasp him again, to try, this time, if possible, to stop his yells. "Wretch!"I said, "if you don't stop screeching, and reveal instantly what you promised to tell me, I will have you beaten. You shall speak 1" , ' , "I didn't promise nothing but what I know'd," he said, sud- denly checking his cries.

"I should bear the name of ' Cutty Sark,' if I were to tell this," I thought, "for, a month at least, Jasper is such a tease. So considering the failure, and the mortification, and the absolute supremacy of Pat's cunning over my intelligence, I think I had as well keep the whole matter to myself.' I need not say that from this time Pat was no favorite of mine, and that whatever repugnance I had felt to him before, was increased, by his deceit and impertinence, tenfold. I ignored him altogether, a matter which seemed to escape his attention, for nothing could exceed his absurd obsequiousness around my chair, or about my plate, or whenever comfort of mine was concerned. My growing distrust of him was confirmed, when, a week or two later, Bianca detected him stealing, and through this detection gained insight into the systematic pilfering which had been going on in the pantry and store-room, ever since Pat McCormick was ad- mitted as a table attendant. He bore an unblushing front, however, under the shame of this exposure, or perhaps his imperfect nature scarcely conceived the import of such a word. Disgusted as I was with him, I could hardly repress a smile occasionally, at the absurd earnestness with which he performed his functions, and the self-complacency of his whole demeanor. He could not by any admonition be prevented from breaking repeatedly, into the conversation, and expressing his own very peculiar opinions on certain subjects. He had a romantic project on hand, often repeated to my extreme discomfiture, of finding out and exterminating the cat, which, in ' G *                  , n   60       THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. accordance with the nursery legend to that effect, he believed to have possessed herself of and eloped with Jasper's tongue; and he persisted in blowing his breath on the grey streak in my grand- mother's hair, and even trying to brush it off with his napkin, as he stood in his white-aproned' dignity behind her chair, under the deeply-rooted impression that it was a colony of ashes which he held it his duty to disperse. When Dr. Quintil said grace, his closed eyes and moving lips, and overdone devoutness were irre- sistibly ridiculous, and at such times he held his salver clasped to his breast, like a shield of defence against the arrows of the evil one, while his horse-shoe mouth expressed a strange mixture of sanctity and silliness. My grandmother bore with surprising equanimity his alternate mistakes and absurdities. Anything was better to her than the presence of strangers, and respect for Bianca's recent grief, for- bade her attendance at the table. Indeed, at such a time of absorbing anxiety, details were over- looked or fol'gotten, and discomfort placidly submitted to, which, at any other, would have been fruitful cause for irritation. For still the days rolled by, and still there came no tidings of the fugitive, in whom so many hearts were bound, each in its separate fashion of love, pity, or intereXt i^ tV             s       "    t   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUU VER.     6. CHAPTER V. YET, as far as she was able, the mistress of Bouverie extended her care, as usual, over all necessary provisions for the comfort and welfare of those around her. Her very flowers were not wholly forgotten. I remember that she desired me to go and superintend Pat in the task of laying and pegging down her roses, as the clouds of November gathered over the- heavens, and threatened to cover the earth with snow, succeeded probably by hard frost.            - "We shall lose them else, Lilian, and we have no one. to lift them now," she said. This task, a delicate one, as all flower-fanciers know, had devolved yearly on Smith, who, although still an occupant of the cottage, was no longer in my grandmother's employment. Some unexpired contract gave him the right to remain there until Christmas; but Dr. Quintil had sternly forbidden him to show,-his face on the precincts of Bouverie again, beyond his own inclosure, an edict obeyed as strictly, as he knew it would have. been enforced. In compliance with my grandmother's request, I approaclied the flower-beds on which Pat was working, and after giving him directions, stood watching him, as he threw the rich leaf-mold lightly over the pegged-down trailing limbs of the still green Solfaterre and Augusta roses, seldom naked in our half-southern clime until January, even when exposed to the utmost rigors of \   62       THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE j the season. This promised, however, to be one of unusual gloom and severity, The sternness of my manner seemed to force conviction on his dull faculties that I was displeased with him; and his penitential glances betrayed that memory was at work to reproduce the cause. He sought in vain to beguile my icy mood at first, by skillful allusions to my favorite flowers. "See, Miss Lilian, the white lilies is peeping up again I wonder will they put on their white fodolscaps in snow-time, like the bad school-boys? They turns their foolscaps upside dowi, Miss Lilian, to catch the rain and sunshine--that's all the same as meat and drink to them, Dr. Quintil says." "Be quiet, Pat, and proceed with your work. I have, nothing to say to you." "Here's a double violet, Miss Lilian-must I cover that too? Maybe you'd like to pull the flowers first, they smells so good, and there are plenty under the leaves, all hid away, like pritty little children under their mother's apron. I have seed 'em when I came along hide just so; and oh, Miss Lilian, here's a slip of' sweet-smelling stuff I planted this spring, hid away under the rose- bush, as green as grass, with a little weed growing out of it- smell it, Miss Lilian."  He referred to a sprig of lemon verbena, a leaf of which he now extended to me somewhat timidly-unnoticed, of course. "Cats love to smell this," he- said, "as well as humans; they goes all around the flower-beds hunting it, and sniffing it, like ladies. They are mighty genteel things, any way, cats is, Miss Lilian, and keeps off witches,"'he said, dropping his voice, with an- expression of grotesque awe. This last theory about cats was entirely new to me, though I   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        63 recognized the truth of Pat's first description of their habits, and had laughed more than once at the quaint affectation of their odor- seeking fastidiousness. "Pat, once for all, you must not dare to speak to me at all, after your shameful behavior, or Dr. Quiniil shall know it," I said. "Work in silence, sir 1"  He continued for some time to spade diligently, after this de- cided rebuff, apparently humiliated by my treatment, and keeping his eyes steadily fixed on the ground.       At length, as if determined to dare all in one more venture, he thrust his hand into his pocket, and, drawing out a huge ring, ex- tended it toward me, between his first finger and thumb, as deli- cately as a dancing-master could have done, with the words, "Miss Lilian, will you trade?" I glanced involuntarily at the ring he held, as he spoke, and, in another moment, had snatched it from his fingers, and was eagerly examining it. I knew at once it was my grandfather's--I had seen it, on more than one occasion, lying on his secretary, and could not be mistaken. It had contained an onyx seal, and, in the interior, I now found an inscription confirming my suspicions. Engraven in fine Roman characters were the words: "THE CZAR TO BOUVERIE." "Boy, where did you get this ring? Pat, answer me, did he send it to me by you? Is it a sign of distress or safety? Oh, Good! I wish I knew 1" and in my sorrowful uncertainty the tears rolled over my cheeks. "I found it in the ash-pit, Miss Lilian," he said, speaking with more intelligence than usual, and apparently humanized by my distress. "I thought you would like to have it, because it be- A/    ,      .    "      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. longed to hi{m," and he glanced at the circular hall and dome- now undergoing repairs-with as much significance as he could manage to throw into his scattered physiognomy. It was a massive ring, beautifully chased and molded, with the double-headed eagle of Russia carved on each side of the large cavity from which the seal had disappeared. "Where is the seal, boy," I asked, sternly, "that fitted this circle when-you found it? I want that, also-it was very wrong of you to remove it. You must give it up, Pat, or you will have to be punished," and I handed him the ring. "Do you think I'm a thief, Miss Lilian?" he asked, coloring violently, and struggling for a moment, as if with feeling he was trying to repress. I had not anticipated such sensibility, nor could I very well reconcile it with his recent conduct under similar charges, and even detection. "I found this ring where I told you, Miss Lilian, and a 'finder is as good as an owner, mammy says ; and I'll hold on to it, if you won't trade, and he stuffed it again into his pocket, and proceeded with his spading. Not, however, without glancing at me, from time to time, to watch the effect of his strategic assumptions of indifference .               ' "That ring is neither yours nor mine, Pat. It belongs right- fully now to your mistress," I said, at last; " yet, rather than give her trouble about it, I will trade with you, as you call it, for any. thing reasonable. What will you take for the ring, Pat?" "A free pardon, Miss Lilian," he said, humbly again extending it toward me. I received it silently; then reflecting on Dr. Quintilian's sus. picions and my own, I determined to make one 'more effort to gain the. truth from the simpleton.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERI.        65 "Pat," I said, "I will forgive you on one condition only-for aI am very angry with you, and shall always remain so, unless you "agree to what I propose; you must tell me all, everything, about the man you called a king when you saw him upstairs in his crimson gown. The master of Bouverie, you know--him that went away-you must tell me where you saw him last, and where you left him, and what he said to you; if you want to save his life, you must do this. Then you shall have your free pardon, Pat-you shall, indeed, and a great deal more." "Don't you know Dr. Quintil is after him to kill him, or to give him up to them officers?" he whispered, rolling his eyes frightfully, while his face assumed its deepest purple hue. "You are crazy, Pat--absolutely crazy I Dr. Quintil, on the contrary, would die to save him." " He is- just fooling you and the mistress, Miss Lilian. Didn't I see him carrying them policemen all over the house to hunt for him? And didn't he go after Hernshaw, in his buggy, to help him find the master, and get the gowld? Mammy know'd he always hated him, and now he'll never rest till he gives him up to the carrion-crows-that's what I calls 'em 1" "Tell me, then, Pat," I said, as calmly as I could, almost frantic with anxious -curiosity, as I was, yet perceiving the utter inutility of reasoning with him about his absurd suspicions-im. movable, like other figments of his imperfect brain. "Tell me, then, what you do know about him I I love him, Pat-I'm very unhappy because he is gone, and suffering, perhaps. And I will promise you, on your holy cross, not to tell any one what you tell me, except my grandmother." "She hates him too "' he said, with his simple leer. "Both on 'em hates him! but I will tell you all I know, Miss Lilian, if you   "     WTIE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. will promise to believe me, and never -ax me another question while you live." I agreed briefly to both propositions, preposterous as they were; impossible, in one sense. "Don't tell nobody, Miss Lilian." "No, indeed, Pat," I said, my heart beating wildly in my throat with anxiety and suspense. "Speak; don't keep me waiting ;" and in my agony I clasped my hands almost prayer- fully to the provoking idiot, who had played so cruelly withlmy feelings. "Listen, then, Miss Lilian!" "Boy, I am listening!" "Well, then, if I must speak, I must; but I mint to hould my sacrit," he said, breaking out into a fierce Irish accent; as he did occasionally, when not under restraint. "Whin the house-top was blow'd up he flew up in the air, and the witches resaved him in their arms, and he is safe now wid the blessed Vargin herself. That's all, Miss Lilian 1i And he looked at me with an expression of subtile foolishness- if such a thing could be. Junius Brutus never played his part better! It was more than I could bear. "You unmitigated fool; you incorrigible, preposterous ape- you imp in human form!"I exclaimed, in an uncontrollable fit of impatience and rage. "I wish it was no sin to torture flesh-I would wring this secret, if secret you have, from you, at the stake itself." He did not understand the full meaning of my words, evidently --for, at first, a flickering smile played over his grotesque features; but, as he read the import of my angry speech in my stormy   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUYEITE.       67 countenance, he gave way to a fit of childish blubbering--sitting down finally, and covering his face with his hands, while the big tears literally tumbled from between his parted fingers.

"Go on with your work, boy," I said, sternly'; "and take this to pay for your ring-finding ;" and I tossed him an eagle, I carried about me as a pocket-piece. Looking back as I entered the house, I saw him still sitting on the ground, in the same dejected attitude. "The money will comfort him," I thought; "and make amends for all, poor avaricious fool! He knows nothing, that: s evident; and, like many of his betters, affects a knowledge he does not possess as a means of power. Yet, how completely he has baffled and fooled me, as he would say I Ay, to the very 'top of my bent!" That night a piece of gold was laid under my plate, at the supper-table-an enigma to all, save Pat and myself-and the swollen features of the incubus betrayed traces of recent grief, and sullen discontent.   68       THE POUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. CHAP-TEiR VI. WHEN we were alone in her chamber, I related to my grand. mother, all that had occurred from first to last between Pat McCormick and myself, and ended by giving her the ring. She received it with evident emotion. "Times are changed, Lilian," she said, " since the greatest monarch of his' day placed this ring on your grandfather's hand with his own royal fingers, in the presence of his court. The stone that occupied that vacant circle there, was the most magnificent diamond my eyes ever rested on. Its brilliancy was magnetic, and it had a peculiarity, whether from some flaw or intentional sitting, I never knew, from which it- derived its name of the ' Gnome-Eye I' "  I was startled, and uttered a hasty exclamation. "Yes, it was a strange name," she pursued, wholly unconscious of the cause of my amazement; "but had you seen the singularly perfect, almost human eye within, from which issued on every side small glancing rays of light-your astonishment would have reached its climax. It was the most exquisite accident (if such it were) nature ever pleaded guilty to ; but I incline to the belief, that a skillful lapidary was at the bottom of the optical illusion-- for such your grandfather seemed to consider it-and that it was a mere reflection of the eye, without the color that gazed into its depths." '"What became   of the stone, grandmother?"I asked, sups pressing my own experience, with regard' to it. i "Your grandfather had divested it of its setting, and replaced   TIIE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        69 it with an onyx seal, which he had fitted to the aperture. I am of the opinion he did this with a view to such 'an emergency as the present-for he had the stone in his vest-pocket when he left us. At least I recognized the small mother-of-pearl box set with turquoise, in which he always kept it--and he said, putting his hand upon it: 'I have something here that may serve me in an hour of need. I had intended to dispose of it differently had cir- cumstances favored ; but necessity knows no law. It may glitter yet on the brow of a queen, for all I know 1 " "Had he no other resources?"I inquired. l"Was this his sole dependence?" "None, except the gold he received from Dr. Quintil-that green purse, with its contents, was part of a marriage gift Paul meant for you, dearest.  His semi-annual remittance can be received from Bishop Clare, it is true, and thus the obligation can be easily discharged. But under any circumstances, you would prefer to have it thus bestowed, we know." "Unquestionably!  But how is he to be provided for in future, should he remain absent some years even?" '"His income, which, from the necessity of the case, must first pass through the form of coming to me, will hereafter be remitted to him in the, shape of bills, and directed to him under his assumed name. He will receive it thus: through the hands of his banker, in whatever city he takes up his abode regularly. I am thankful he has this certain means of support in his life-long exile-for, Lilian, he can never return here." "Never return I Oh, grandmother! shall we never see him again?" "Why should you wish it, child? This is no place for him. He can neither find welcome nor safety here again."  She hesi-   4to)      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BO U VEIE. tated a moment. "He has forfeited a thousand times over all claims on me, on all of us. I care, disinterestedly of course, for his safety, but this is all. I remained silent. After a pause, she continued, still speaking with that gloomy composure that had rarely forsaken her since the night of his departure. "I have little doubt that he has made his way to some near sea- port, and taken passage to Europe. We shall not hear from him probably until after his arrival, and then only through Bishop Clare, since letters directed to us openly from abroad might awake suspicion. This step is one he should have taken ten years ago, and would have spared him, and all of us, infinite shame and-anguish. It is the only one that now remains practicable." "And you, grandmother, will you continue to live here i"I asked, in cold surprise. "Certainly, Lilian; I hope you do not suspect me of the folly of flying in his footsteps I I might have consented to go to Italy, had this exposure never occurred, and have continued my cares for his comfort there, feeling at the same time assured that Jasper would be benefited by the surroundings of art, and my own life prolonged, and yours brightened by the influence of climate and the freedom from scrutiny.

But many little obstacles rose constantly in the way of this arrangement,-- and before measures c'ould be concluded on-lo, the catastrophe I Henceforth your grandfather must dwell alone."

I stood before her in the earnest excitement of the moment, and bent upon her inquiring, perhaps angry eyes. "He has chosen his fate, he has made it," she murmured. t-Let him go!"  "Is this the time to flinch from his side 1"I pursued, " in his infirmity, his sorrow, his approaching age? Oh, God I is it of stuff like this the human heart is made? I cannot-no, I can- not believe in this resolution of yours, because its very foundation is so unstable. Who loves you as he loves you?, To whom else are you half so dear, so necessary?

A bubble crushed in a moment, a broken reed, a useless toy applied to stern purposes. Such will his life be, grandmother.

"You overrate your own strength," I interrupted-" your own cruelty rather," I murmured, not unheard by her.

Oh i your course has been so firm, so noble, do not forsake it   72      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. now;" and as I spoke, I threw myself on my knees by her chair, and buried my face in her lap. "Go to him, and comfort him, as you only can comfort," I continued, looking up. "By his very errors and misfortunes, I conjure you to-finish your good work, and follow him to the end of the world if it be needful, Leave not your task incomplete-the task that God has assigned to you. Such a beginning is worthy of a noble ending. Say that you will proceed, dear grandmother." "No more of this," she said, and with a stern, strong grasp she brought me to my feet. 'You preach well, Lilian; by whom have you been ordained-? She smiled bitterly.  "By natural affection," I said, swallowing my indignant tears; "and through that by God himself." Something in my manner seemed to change her mood, for drop- ping the sarcastic bitterness with which she had last spoken, she added in low accents: "You do not love Jasper, Lilian, or you could never wish for your grandfather's return." - "Not love him I Oh, you know that I do love him more than my own life." And I stood mute and tearful before her, my head bowed on my breast. "Do you not know, my child, that as his wife you would incur the hatred, nay the curse of Erastus Bouverie? Do you suppose the old leaven is dead, or that it would be even safe to trust yourself in his presence after such a marriage? Oh, child, you little know all the perfidy, all the cruelty-that dwells enshrined in one, of whom you in your young romance have made a hero? Of one so unfortunate, so doomed, that, his sorrows seem, at times, even in the eyes of his victims, to wipe away the long score of his crimes. Lilian, do you recall the first curse of Moses on the land   X     -THE' HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VEIE.              73 of Egypt? Time was, my child, when the man you plead for     had power like this, and the very water I -raised to my lips seemed tinged with blood to me by acts of his." "Have pity, grandmother I  I discard all other claims," I said, thrilled by the mysterious horror of her allusions. "Duty, affection, habit, I surrender these in my appeal for him I agree with you they are justly forfeited; but give at least what S    you daily ask from  God-mercy, compassion.  Do not for- i   sake your husband in any mistaken interest for me, for others.

We two can struggle on   -  alone, if indeed you forbid us to follow you, but your place is at his side here and hereafter." She gazed at me long and earnestly before she replied to this passionate outhurst, of mine, made with clasped hands and stream- ing eyes. At. one time, great tears gathered in her eyes, at- another, cold flitting smiles quivered across her face; but when she spoke to me she was calm, and sad, and determined, as one who rises from a last vigil by a coffin now closed forever, stamped with the great seal of the inevitable. Ji, "Lilian," she said, " do you suppose that there is any sugges- j   tion possible to your young, inexperienced mind, that has not been i more than once revolved by mine?--that has not become familiar even to my thoughts?

Who holds the clue to these? Would any one be what he is, could he be otherwise by a mere act of volition? Can any one account for his condition, or half the causes that led him to it? We can, indeed, in looking back over the past, see points in our career where we think that we could have paused or proceeded; but how many more do we be- hold, past which we feel that we have been borne as on the rush- ing wings of fate itself, without consent or premonition of our own? ;  How reconcile these apparent inconsistencies?

'g    Answer these questions, oh sophist I who, in thy little range of liberty, darest assert absolute freedom, and pardon me this homely illustration of my conception of a mighty truth. There is a hen tied to the old apple-tree, in my garden, by a string twelve feet long. Within the limits of this string she can scratch, cluck, fret, gather together her chirping brood. Beyond it, a higher power than she can conceive of, has ordained that she cannot pass. The string, and the shadow of the apple-tree, are the boundaries of her lot-absolute, stringent, indisputable facts, neither to be overcome by her capacity, nor yet by that capacity comprehended. Yet this is a wise and even benevolent arrange- ment, in which her best interest is considered, as well as that of the owner of the garden.

The community of suffering is a terrible but established law. Its justice we do not see, its compensation we know not here- may never know ; but this it is given to us to feel, thai those who stand aloof from it are accursed; even here on- earth, and worthy of the cleaving curse hereafter. Let us take comfort in the belief that our Creator has im- planted no instinct in vain, and that pity and fidelity, even when affection is dead, form a noble part of duty. Let us believe, likewise, that we owe something to the past as well as present; and that having once loved, is an anchored obliga- tion to the heart that loves no more. Cut loose from this fast principle, the ship of life drifts carelessly along, and finds no more a harbor in which it can abide, and cast its anchor ; and the shores of life fleet by it like a dream. This noble ancestress of mine had acted up to every precept of her conscience, every murmur of the finer instinct of compassionate forbearance, every god-like principle of mercy and self-sacrifice. Was she to abandon all these now, for the hollow semblance of ease and prosperity that remained to her? Was she to look back from the plough, on which she had so long laid a guiding hand, and forego the golden harvest of self-acquittal? No, this should not be. Every voice of my soul cried against it.

NOVEMBER closed in with an austerity rare in that mild climate, and at that usually open season; snow had fallen, succeeded by severe frosts, and the blighted dahas and chrysanthemums, sad effigies of autumn, stood brown and leafless in the garden, from which all summer-bloom had long departed. Cold and constant rains, and bleak northeast winds combined ho make us prisoners in the house, and wholly dependent on s ch resources as we pos- sessed within ourselves ; these, even, were seldom called upon. The time dragged heavily on, even to those in whom youth and hope infused their own elements of elasticity and enjoyment; but to her in whom these were dead how leaden were its footsteps- how darkly measured its progress I We knew that the utmost vigilance still prevailed with regard to my grandfather's move- ments. We had been subjected several times since he left us to the shame and' inconvenifence of a renewed search through our premises, ard house itself. Its roof could no longer afford him an asylum; he was by necessity an outcast. Strange, strange indeed it was, that while all who might have been conceived to feel interest in his arrest- all that he had injured or offended--remained quiet, or enlisted their best energies in his behalf, mere outsiders, who could have no possible concern in his past or future, were mad in the pursuit. The public mind had "taken on' a great excitement. There   THE IIOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.  was something so strange, so romantic, the papers said, in the idea, that a criminal ten years concealed not twenty miles from the court-house in which sentence of death had been passed on him should, by a catastrophe, wholly unaccountable and unex- plained, be brought to light, as by the hand of Providence itself I "The very stones were displaced, and the massive walls of his hiding-place rent open, that justice might be satisfied, and the law fulfilled 1" said one eloquent sectarian sheet; and the druids of the press generally made their circles of stones,, and attired them- selves in woad-colored weeds, and prepared with unaffected and pious delight, to offer human sacrifice. It was while this tide-- of persecution surged high, and my grandmother's condition was one of extreme nervous prostration, that Bishop Clare came to Bouveiiie. How we all welcomed him, our strength, our protection, our only earthly consolation, we felt him then; the friend who could be relied on through danger, through suffering, through disgrace, through death itself; the pure, the strong, the humble, the immaculate old man I He had not seen my grandfather, had not heard of him, save through the voice of public rumor. It seemed that Erastus 3Bouverie had not aimed after all to reach St. Stephen's, or so aiming had failed and taken a different direction. Our friend (our only one) had come immediately on his return from a distant part of his diocese, to see what could be done ; what he could do. Alas I he found himself powerless, at least for the time, and could only conjecture and console. He believed, as my grandmother did, that his consummate ad- dress had carried Erastus Bouverie safely through his foes to the sea-shore, and, that assuming an alias, he had sailed for some   European port. In the meantime, he advised Dr. Quintil to convert the gold he brought with him, and gave into his hands, into bills, that could be sent abroad at an hour's warning, when- ever letters arrived directing their destination. " The first communication will probably come to me, to prevent suspicion ; but you shall have it as soon as a horse can gallop from Croften thither ; and in the meantime keep up your spirits, Camilla-never more needed than now," he said, turning to my grandmother, " and look fate full in the eye. It is like a lion, believe me ; it quails before the resolute." " Do you separate fate from God, that you speak of it thus ?" I asked, impulsively. The question seemed to trouble him. "I mean," he said, " that courage disarms destiny of its harshest sting, that is all. I do not recognize the Greek theory of a blind' necessity.  Understand me fully,; Lilian, on this point." "Yes, I know," I said: "The beaten slave- creeps close to the whip, to break the force of the lash; this is what you mean l" " We should not compare our Creator to a hardytask-master, my daughter," said the mild priest. "He is ever merciful  Are we not told in words of almost scriptural beauty, that he ' tempers the wind to the shorn lamb ?' Does not holy writ itself declare, that 'he counts the sparrows as they fall;' -that he numbers ' the hairs of our heads ?' What infinite care, solicitude, affec- tion, do not these sacred words convey ?" "It is all mystery," I murmured; " but oh, there is so much in life that is hard to bear." "And but for this, dear Lilian, who would seek heaven, and-   84W      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. learn to welcome death? Could all be young, happy, prosperous, the arms of Jesus would be stretched in vain."  "We are not consulted on the subject, or perhaps human incli- [ nations would be found at variance with these received opinions. There are few so base as to wish to outlive their happiness. I, for one, pray to die before any one of those I love." "And yet it is your doom to survive them all," he rejoined,  i turning upon me sorrowful eyes. "You will yet find yourself alone with God!" "Let him take me rather in the very zenith of mpy happiness, while the cup mantles to my lip, if such a thing can ever be. I ask to die before I am desolate and old," I said, passionately.  "He will do what is best for you, Lilian-be sure of that ; nor have you any right to question his justice, whatever may betide. But I, who judge well of probabilities from experience, looking on your lithe figure and healthful face, and a certain look of power that accompanies intense vitality, may safely, I think, prophesy, without an accident, long life for you."  "Life I Ah, father, mine will pass with theirs I -love, no matter how long my frame survives them, for life is far more than mere existence, and we may die young, yet seemingly live to be very old." "Ah, Lily, that is one of your poetical ideas; the reality is, that as long as the brain thinks, and the heart beats, we live, and are bound to our fellow-beings." "You would have made a poor St. Simeon Stylites, father ; yet see how Tennyson has immortalized him lately. Isolation is not : your theory."                    -       I "He had a good constitution, certainly, that Simeon Sty- lites," broke in Dr. Quintilian. "The facts, if true, as recorded    -            *U    ' *    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOTERIE.        85 by Tennyson, are worth preserving, if merely as matters of medical interest. I wish you would look among the archives of the Fathers, dear bishop, and see if any faith may be placed in these assertions of that English romancer and rhymer Lilian is so crazy about." "There certainly was such a saint," replied the bishop; '" buti I remember very little more about him than his name, and that he lived on a column for thirty years, provided for, probably, by his friends below, in a precarious manner; but whether he had "* "An umbrella?" broke in Dr. Quintil, irreverently. "The success imputed to him in prayer I know not," proceeded the bishop, gravely, as if he had not heard the interruption, yet flushing slightly in spite of self-command, at the irrelevant inter- polation. All this time my grandmother sat like one in a dream, gazing into the fire. The immovable attitude she maintained, her bowed head, her clasped hands, her feet placed closely together, yet care- lessly extended, all denoted the deepest dejection, the most self- absorbed indifference to what was going on around her. From this mood she was aroused at last by a conversation which, begun in undertones by Bishop Clare and Dr. Quintil, had loudened as it proceeded, until it reached my ear, and finally hers. They were agitating the possibility of Mr. Bouverie's arrest, should he not have made his escape, as they both fondly persuaded themselves, however, he had done. They were revolving, as a desperate resource, under such circumstances, an Appeal to the governor in his behalf. - "' It is no shame to be refused in such a cause, and names shall be appended to this petition that were not affixed to the other--   86      THE HOUSEHOLD OF' BOUVERKIE.  those of Paul and Jasper Quintilian." were the first distinct words I: I heard.                              1' The bishop started. "I had not thought of this," he said;    " "there certainly is a difference. Such magnanimity ought--nay, must-make its impression on any man of feeling." "It may," said Dr. Quintilian ; " we can say no more. I know the man--I know his uncompromising nature, when once aroused , to enmity, and his almost Jewish opinions on the subject of retri- bution. I confess I am. not sanguine. Had this necessity arisen in Governor Leadbeater's term, there would have been far greater ! prospect of success. Even then we, should have had much to con- tend against; but there, at least, there was no personal dislike." "It is a bitter grudge, I know," resumed the bishop; "and whether founded in wrong or right, almost a part of his being   ! now, I fear. Yet there are other considerations that may weigh with him-the prosperity of a family, the long lapse of time, the ancient friendship for Mrs. Bouverie." . "That will not weigh one grain in the?alance with James Staunton,' said the person last mentioned, rousing at last from apathy, and; speaking with earnest vehemence. "Innocent or guilty, as Mr. Bouverie may have been, of offence against him, his convictions are immovable on that point, and he regards me, I well know, as the blameless cause of all. As well seek to animate  with feeling this marble hearth beneath my feet, as the heart of our enemy with mercy for our sorrows. But why agitate the matter at all? He is gone, and no eyes of ours shall behold him more. Let us forget-let us try and forget his very existence. It can never be more to us again than these ashes." "You are right, perhaps, my daughter," said the bishop, in  slow, severe, accents, "to, doubt the existence of mercy in the y   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        87  heart of the foeman of Erastus Bouverie, since by his own hearth- stone such sentiments are expressed." The rebuke seemed to sting her to whom it was'addressed, but for all answer she turned on him a look--a gaze, rather-so sad, so speaking, that' the tears sprang to his eyes as he met it, and understood its significance. "You who know all," it seemed to say, "I thought at least you would do me justice i" and the sad eyes drooped again on stone and ashes. Cold as she seemed to be, that she was not insensible, the phy- sical change that she had undergone denoted. No brilliant crim- son now illumined her olive cheek, clear, pale as marble. No sudden fire flashed from her dark eyes, lighting them up as with the glory of youth. No gorgeous dress gave variety to her appear- ance, and well became her stately mien and aspect.   That "masquerade of solitude," as she had called it once, was over now forever; but with it seemed to have vanished much that was real and invigorating. It was a motive, at all events, for exertion and personal interest that could never be restored. Her rounded pro- portions were shrinking visibly away, even in the two short weeks of anxiety she had experienced, for her food remained almost un- tasted before her, and sleep was fast becoming a stranger to her eyes. She was suffering far more than any of us, despite her stoical mood, her uncompromising sternness, and the body betrayed the soul. Where was all this to end? What was the true condition of my grandfather, and when should we learn it? Alas, a dark suspicion began to be rife in my heart-a suspicion never breathed to any, one but Jasper-and hardly allayed, when after many days of active search and riding through the woods that lay bec   88      TuHE OUSEHOLD OF BOU V  lE.     tween Bouverie and Croften, he came to the conclusion that the  s doubt I entertained was impossible, and a mere matter of morbid imagination. It seemed to me that he might in his feeble con- . dition have fallen and died untended in the forest. For a long time I could not bring myself to believe that he was safe. When i I heard the wind howl, and the rain fall, I shuddered with the thought that he was exposed to both, ill, or dying, or dead ; and I fancied the cold, uncared-for corpse, lying perhaps at the foot of a tree, among the drifting leaves; then the later horrors, the slow decay, the vultures, the long, dreary winter, wrapping the dishonored remains with snow; the spring bringing them to light again ; the bleaching b6nes, the discovery perhaps at last made by wopd-choppers or wayfarers, and the identification through means of some shred of clothing, or the indestructible " gnome eye itself in its jewelled box. These visions pursued and tortured me. They were dispelled at last I believe by the very shock to my nervous - system, which might have been supposed to have confirmed them ; and again I began to lend confidence to the hope that he had escaped and baffled his pursuers, )', i? 3   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVErIE.        89 CHAPTER II. "ATE one afternoon, I took advantage of my grandmother's absence from her chamber, to ascend the spiral stair again that led to the sealed apartments of Bouverie. The secret door, long locked, was open now to all. The repairs necessary to the dome and walls had just been completed, the furniture had been replaced; all was silent and little changed save in the absence of life and occupancy the rooms presented. ( But every one knows  the mighty difference created by this void; the cold, the sicken- ing aspect of a chamber recently abandoned. The chairs arrayed in rows, the fireless hearth, the unincumbered tables, the prim mantel, the stripped or unpressed bed, the drawn-down curtains, and perhaps the forgotten and faded flowers; we have all felt, more or less, the power these things have over our spirits, and bow irresistibly they remind us of desolation and death. It was, however, some moments before I put a foot in the chamber my grandfather had last occupied-the winter chamber into which he had recently removed-and which was still secured as when he left it, with the close inner shutters and nailed-up. jalousies. I paused in the rotunda. The skylight was open to admit the air needful for drying the fresh plaster of the room, and it gave admission to a few gleams of sunshine that had broken through the clouds, so densely piled all day in the north- eastern heavens, less heavy toward the west.  My entrance alarmed some birds that had taken refuge in the hall, and I in turn was startled by their wild and sudden fluttering, as they   90       THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. wheeled about the walls, and struck such pictures as had been hung on the uninjured portions of these, their sharp beaks sounds ing on the glass that covered them with a clear, clicking regu. larity, and their winnowing wings filling the silence with murmur- ing musical vibrations. There stood unstirred the cabinet of coins and minerals and medals; and the fearful-apparatus, appa- rently uninjured, that had played such a frightful part in our tragedy ; the copper vessels glowing in the red sunshine of even- ing, as though heated by the fires beneath. But the soul of all these suggestive attributes was wanting. The active step, the graceful form, the expressive voice, the glance, the smile of alternate power and witchery, where were they now? Alas, I shuddered at the bleak anguish my conjectures awakened I "Grandfather!"I half exclaimed, "if indeed you are dead, and spirits be permitted to revisit the earth, return and speak to me; do not fear to startle me; I am nerved to bear anything rather than this wearing anxiety. But come to me as I knew you, not in wan, ghostly presence, awful, shadowy, and mysteri- ous, or perhaps indeed my brain may shrink and reel in spite of the strength I feel to meet the truth 1 Come in familiar guise, and tell me how it fares with you, dear grandfather i" Even as I murmured these excited words, I passed into the inner chamber, and stood at first, almost blind, in the dusky twi- light. The great bedstead loomed up with its heavy drawn curtains, like some gigantic pall against the wall. The table, cleared from its litter of books and papers, stood bare and mas- sive in the centre of the floor. In the corner, of the fireless hearth was the accustomed chair in which he loved to sit, large' and cushioned, and covered with brown Russia leather, emitting   THEI HOUSEHOLD OF BOu VYER.,      91 a faint, odorous smell. It seemed more than aught else identified I   with him, and I approached it now as if it were a familiar friend, on whom I might lean and make my lamentations. God of heaven, it was occupied Hand by whom? Had my wild invocation been answered? Dressed in his rich robe of flowered brocade, his hands crossed upon his breast, his head covered with a white napkin, so as to be invisible to me, sat- oh, could I doubt the familiar presencel-my grandfather, in the attitude of a calm sleeper. I shrieked and called his name, standing with clasped hans, half frozen with terror before the chair. The figure rose. I saw no more, but turned and fled to the outer hall, where I sank half fainting on the sofa. The cowardice, natural to all mankind, had for the time asserted its supremacy, the dread of the supernatural, and conquered the courageous teachings of affection and constancy. I lay with my face hidden among the cushions, too much alarmed and bewildered to determine .on any course of action, yet : gradually nearing the conviction that what I had seen was no shadow, and trying to gain courage to investigate the matter more closely, when I heard my name called by a familiar voice. "Miss Lilian,"' it said, " don't be frightened; it was only me." "You, Bianca  Is it possible. But what is this mummery for? Row could you contrive such a plan for startling me? What brings you here?"I added, a little sternly. "The same, maybe, that brings you, Miss Lilian-sorrow and memory." She stood before me with her downcast eyes, her deprecating humility; yet I could not help feeling that she was an intruder. I said, with some bitterness:   "2      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVtERIE. H"I should think you of all others would shrink from these chambers, Bianca." "Oh, no, Miss Lilian. It-is a comfort to me in some sort, to see the very place where my poor Fabius met his death; a com- fort too to cry alone sometimes, out loud. In my room I cannot do this. Up here I disturb no one." "Poor, poor Bianca!"I said, suddenly smitten with pity and remorse for my hardness, and extending my hand to her, "Yes, Miss Lilian, dear ; I come here to try and realize things a little. My trouble is now, that I cannot believe that Fabius is dead. I find myself laying out his clothes, and watching for his step sometimes ; and it seems to me that I am dreaming a dull dream, and will soon wake up, whens I try to bring the truth before me." "Yet I cannot see how wrapping yourself in my grandfather's dressing-gown could assist you to realize the past," I added, with another touch of asperity. "That I should think, Bianca, might be held sacred to his memory at least." "I was cold, Miss Lilian," she said with simplicity; "and I wrapped myself in it, and sat down in the great chair to cry, and perhaps I fell asleep ; I don't know. But when I saw you I felt startled.  Were you long there, Miss Lilian?" "Not long, Bianca; but I confess you startled me in turn, with that white napkin spread-over your head like a ghost." She smiled faintly. "Did you take me for the spirit of poor Fabius himself, dear, dressed in his master's gown? Ah, child I ghosts never appear dressed in gay garments like that; but always in solemn black, or white, or grey sometimes. I mind when the talk was out about your Grandfather Byrne's walking, (a soldier he was, child, and wore his epaulets when he fought   g           'THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        93 the English, and dressed as gay as any other officer) that those who saw him said he appeared in his grey undress frock, without a color. That is the fashion among spirits, it seems." She was cut short by the brisk tinkling of the hall bell, a sound rarely heard at Bouverie ; and went hastily to answer its sum- monso Our visitor was Father Conrad in person. I forgot to say that the bishop's stay had been limited to a few hours by stringent circumstances; and that during this time Pat McCormick, from whom he still hoped to extract a confession that might throw some light on the fugitive, had been vainly sought for. The dame, herself, lay ill with rheumatic fever, an'i wouldbe doing injustice to a post to have compared her deafness under this aggravation to its oywn proverbial obtuseness. The effort to make her hear had been found wholly fruitless ; but she still retained the gift of speech, and she used it to signify her desire to see Father Conrad, "whose power wid his hands," the dame stated, gave him the advantage over every physician in allaying pain, and inducing slumber. Pat had been dispatched for this unconscious mesmerist, and, as under these circumstances the bishop could learn nothing from either the'dame or her grandson, he promised to return speedily, and in the meantime, to pursue his investigations elsewhere, with: all the diligence he possessed. His mind was, however, I saw clearly, pretty well made up as to the probability, if not certainty, of my grandfather's escape, and his safety from his pursuers.   "      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE4. CtHAPTER III. WHEN I went into the dining-room, where ray grandmother and Dr. Quintil were seated with the eccentric priest, the scene of the disguised fugitive seemed to be enacted again before me. Again, the dim light of the lamp and smoldering fire diffused a partial radiance through the room, and the table spread for the evening meal boasted its steaming urn and supper appointments, made this time, however, under Bianca's careful superintendence. And again, in the deep chair, the uncouth form of the father appeared, complete in every attribute, even to the yellow bandanna, spotted with red, and the blue spectacles, and if possible, more of a caricature in reality than his own effigy. But, unlike his representative, he did not decline the tendered cup of tea, nor pause with this; but drawing up a chair (for none had been placed for him, either through accident or design), commenced an attack on the provisions, which threatened to carry famine into' the fortress, and which brought up unwonted smiles to my grand- mother's lip. "Are. you not going to give the snake his cast-off skin, ac- cording to directions?"I whispered to Dr. Quintil. "He has heard of it, and asks to see it," he replied; "but it would be too severe a shock to him I fear. He would never for- give us." "Do you think he never saw a mirror, that his ignorance of his own appearance is so profound?"I asked. "He has forgotten the first time he saw one probably, and has O   ATHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VYEIE.       95  grown accustomed to his reflection in the glass, but this would be a vivid and unexpected reminder of the truth." I could not help laughing at the idea of such -sensibility on his part, such vanity rather, for he certainly was hideous to me, if man ever was. The gutta percha mask was perhaps a flattered resemblance, hands and all, forl the originals were embellished with filthy nails and snuffy thumbs. "He could not be ignorant of his own appearance", I thought. I was soon undeceived. "And have you iver feenished my porthrait, iMister Jasper?" he asked at last, with his peculiar and unpleasant brogue, most wonderfully imitated by his representative, even to the snuffle. Jasper confessed his want of perseverance in this case, with courteous regret. "Feenish it, feenish it, Jasper, it will make your fortune I St. Silenus (he was a popular Greek saint, I believe) has never been properly represented-more's the shame; and stick to your oregeenal design, and introduce the sacred ass and panniers. He's nothing without his emblems." I thought at first he was jesting, but there could be no doubt of his earnestness when he added: "Throw in the greapes, too, Jasper, they are emblems of the sacred wine, you know, and the blood of the vigitable creation, so to speak ; and I think if you catch my best expression, you will find yourself far on the road to feem." "And what do you consider your best expression, father?" asked Dr. Quintil, with humorous hypocrisy. "Well, I should say, my binivolint expression, which my con. gregashon considers the most suitable to my style of fatures, a leetle too harsh otherwise; such as illumines me countenance when I spake a blessing, or discoorse of the promised jyes,    96      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.

"The likeness is remarkable," continued Dr. Quintil drily, "to the style of saints painted by the latter artist ;" adding, sotto voce, "drunken old bandits might pass as saints among the ferocious ones you know, Lily." "Were you ever told you were like St. Panza, father?" lhe inquired, elevating his voice again; then -dropping it, he added, "Sancho, I believe, means saint in Spanish, but I lam not certain, Lily." ".I don't remimber, I'm sure ; but I've been tould so often of my resimblance. to these holy personages, that I am more and more convinced of the nature of my vocation; and what is still more remarkable, my tonsure is a natural one, Dr. Quinthil. I have the happiness to be bald by neeture, which I think alwavs a special mark of superhuman preferment." "It has astonished me, father, that a man of your gay and engaging appearance and manners should have chosen so severe a  life; but I see now why it was; you preferred to serve heaven  ; to devoting yourself to the ladies, among whom you might have been so popular; it was because of these signs of vocation .of which you speak.  Truly a great sacrifice," and he shook his head. "If you could have seen the fair crachure whose heart my pri- ferince broke, you might see so indeed," he remarked with a blast i of his nasal trumpet, which resounded far beyond the depths of I the bandanna handkerchief, and was meant perhaps to be senti-  h             '        0ii   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEKIE.        97 mental., "I think Miss Lilian resimbles her grately," he said gravely, yet with a quiet, humorous twinkle in his eyes at my sud-  denly evinced annoyance, " but maybe she was the prittiest afther all/y he added, by way of bringing me to my senses again, " espaa- cally in regard of the hair." And he leered maliciously at me. He had fathomed my weakness at once.      , "Do you think Dame -McCormick will live through the night, Dr. Quintil?"I asked, with a serious air, in my anxiety to rid myself of this terrible old bore, whose propinquity was becom- ing intolerable, yet scarcely able to repress a smile. "I can't tell, upon my word,"' he answered gravely. "Whenw I last saw her she raved wildly at me-for offering her some senna tea, and made threats which I considered dangerous in her con- dition of mind. She is evidently flighty, and the last sounds she uttered as I left the room were an imitation of the peculiar notes of her favorite fowl." "God bliss me, I must see to this," bustled the priest.' "She may want the extrame unction this blissed night, for otherwise the dame is well prepared to die, having confissed reglar these tin years back, and mighty free confessions, too, she makes." 'And he left us hurriedly. "Of course when the dame reiterated the syllable ' quack' half a dozen times, Lily, she was not applying it to me at all, but speak- ing wildly, remorsefully perhaps, in the language of a race she has injured deeply, during her long kitchen experience. I did not for a moment appropriate the appellation, although it was accom- panied by a shower of senna tea hurled at me, teacup and all, as I retreated briskly behind the open door. I narrowly escaped a deluge.'  "What a virago she is, to be sure 19' VOL. II.-5   98       THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVELDIE. "A part of our fate, I do believe," he rejoined, "and am therefore submissive. Yet how have we earned such an infliction? It is a very mysterious order of Providence to me, that such an old witch should be thrust upon us by circumstances  ad a part of our very lives, an instrument of daily torture." (' She is what they call a 'cross,' I suppose, in the cant of com- mon folks. What a Frenchman would call a cross ' bonne. "' "Aye, a very cross cross, Lily, a sort of double cross, harder to bear than common crosses, and that I am very sorry we ever came across." So ended this cross fire, There were subjects on which the dame did not touch, however, as we found later, in all of her "free confessions," as he called them, even to Father Conrad. This man, so ignorant of mythology as to confound Silenus with a saint, and think himself complimented by being likened to him; so limited, too, in information as to appear almost idiotia on some subjects, and whose common conversation betrayed both vulgarity and egregious vanity, was in the pulpit a successful and fiery speaker, for the lower orders at least; among whom his practical benevolence made him idolized, and for whom he did not hesitate to perform the most devoted offices in times of sickness and adversity. He was besides a thorough rudimental Latin scholar and effective teacher, and his success as a political ally made him sought by partisans of desperate causes, and filled his purse slily yet unceasingly ; a purse which he in turn clenched avariciously, and opened prodigally, as suited his different moods and interests best. He was said to be a humorist, an:id if so, we were probably the party quizzed. This much is certain.

CHAPTER   IV. AND now thirty days! were come and gone, since, in the silence of the night, and by means never fully explained to us, the Master of Bouverie passed from its walls, and baffled the sentinels beneath them. Still no tidings of his fate reached us ever so remotely, and the reasonable conviction strengthened that he had gone abroad, as time passed, and pursuit failed rather than faltered; for still the bloodhounds of the law were out, stimulated afresh by the large reward recently offered by the governor for his appre- hension, and still our solitude was threatened and even invaded by their presence. Something of security, however sad and unsatisfactory, had commenced, nevertheless, to replace the nervous anxiety of our earlier condition. We began to assure ourselves of his safety, and to look forward to letters confirming our convictions; and, although the subject was never discussed, barely alluded to, from some tacit understanding among us, yet a secret gratulation pos- sessed every spirit, and betrayed itself in renewed interest and occupation.   The cold, grey shadow was slowly being lifted from my grand- mother's face. I had-even seen her smile, and something of appe- tite returned to her, again the pleasant evening intercourse was resumed, and the long neglected lamps, which seemed in honor of Fabius at first to have grown dim and sepulchral, were retrimmed by Bianca, to shine in all their pristine brilliancy. The friendly game of chess or backgammon, the chat over the newspapers, the   ^[THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVECIE:      101 discussion of books and politics, again came to our assistance, and helped to dissipate the mournful monotony of our existence. The social wound seemed to be healing. "T This is something like old times," Jasper wrote to me, in the short-hand that flashed from his fingers almost with the rapidity of spoken words. "If it were not for the presence of that goblin, Pat McCormick, at the table, and the absenice of good old Fabius --heaven rest his soul!-I could realize that matters were un- changed, and that a vision had possessed us. Say, Lilian, was it not all a dream?" "A dream, Jasper! Oh, would that I could think so-l A terrible night-mare even, from which it were happiness to awake. You, who never knew him, can realize nothing of these horrors. Yet you must not undervalue our suffering, nevertheless." "I have forgiven him," he wrote, "I pity him, I would save him, for your sake, at the risk of my own life. Christ, himself, could ask no more of me." As I read these words with eyes moistened with tears, Pat McCormick opened the door, cap in hand, and covered with snow, and, standing without, thrust in his red and grinning face. "He's done come, Miss Lilian," he said, pointing backward with his thumb ; and before I could utter a word of question or surprise, my grandfather stood before us. "Quintil, your gold, untouched!" he said, throwing the purse forward on the table. "Camilla, my love, I have come back to die' with you," and he advanced feebly toward her, extending his hands. "Oh, Bouverie!-oh, my husband!--are you here?" she ex- claimed, as rising to meet him, she threw her arms around his emaciated form, and drew him to her close embrace. It was the  '    102      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. first time I had ever heard her accord him that sacred title, or witnessed the slightest endearment between them. All barriers seemed prostrate now. They stood together, locked in each other's arms, her heavy sobs, and his deep-drawn breathing alone breaking the oppressive silence. Dr. Quintil seemed deeply agitated, his color went and came, his 'hands weie clenched, his manly breast heaved almost as with convulsive emotion. Was he grieved?--was he angry?-was he yielding only the meed of sympathy? Or did dark and stormy memories sweep over him, at that moment, with waves that carried all before them in their irresistible strength? I never knew. Jasper and I stood apart, hand clasped in- hand, not without tears and choking emotion, speechless, pitying spectators of a scene no words could describe, no heart withstand, no witness ever forget. Even the poor idiotic medium of so much uncomprehended emo- tion blubbered in unmeaning sympathy, gaping against the wall in his snow-covered garments for a time, then slipping quietly away. When at last my grandmother drew her unexpected guest to a seat by the fire, and had resumed her own beside him, still silent and weeping, my grandfather extended his hands to me, speaking the one word that was ever the sweetest music to me, in his soul- stirring voice--"Lilian!" I was at his side in a moment, kneeling beside him, embracing him, kissing his hands, weeping wildly over him, with such unut- terable compassion I When I looked around again, Jasper had withdrawn, nor did he ever again stand in my grandfather's presence. For an instant this disappearance pained me--I had hoped so much from the   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       103 influence of the moment; but, recovering myself as quickly as I could, I looked earnestly at the pallid face before me, faltering forth almost involuntarily the feelings with which it filled me. "You are ill, grandfather-oh, so changed!" He smiled that brilliant smile, so irrelevant to all the features of his condition and ours ; then bending his head low, he whispered in my ear: "Ay, darling, I am ill, even unto death; but so happy to be at home again that everything else is forgotten." In truth, thin as he ever was, he was now worn to skeleton lean- ness, and the articulations of his hand bones were almost as distinct as if no flesh had intervened between them and the shrouding skin. "Erastus, how much you must have suffered," my grandmother said, at last, " to be willing to place yourself again in voluntary jeopardy. Oh, Bouverie I I had hoped you were by this time on the high seas, on your way to merge your existence in some great European city, where loss of identity might be safety. This was your wisest course ; why have you not pursued it? Oh, why have-you returned to dare your doom?" "To be with you, Camilla, until- death," he made answer, in his clear pathetic tones. "Erastus, this was madness i" 'What else remained?" he asked. "Would you have had me die without seeing your face and Lilian's again? I felt that I could dare any fate rather than forego such a privilege., "Why did you- not send for us sooner than run such fearful risks? You have been ill; where hasve you lain concealed? Who tended you through your illness? Have you found friends, or has Bishop Clare at last-But I see that you are exhausted; do not speak yet. Later, you will tell us everything."   1     104      THE HOUSEIHOLD OF BOUVERIE. She bathed his brow with the cologne I handed her, then rose to seek a reviving cordial, and some food suitable to his delicate palate, and placing them before him, she pressed him to partake. He drank the cordial ; but put the conserved fruit and biscuit aside. "I cannot eat," he said, as he laid baick his head in the deep-cushioned chair he had last occupied as Father Conrad; and taking her hand, drew it across his brow, then pressed it to his lips. "But I am  strengthened now to answer your inquiries. 'No ; do'not withdraw your hand ; it is life to me to hold it again, and if truth be told, such gift will not long be mine, on any terms." He held her fingers now pressed closely to his bosom. She bent over him tenderly, anxiously; I saw that her tears fell fast. She recognized, perhaps for, the first time in his case, the truth that lay veiled beneath his careless manner and reckless words. The awful and unmistakable shadow was over him at last. And now again came the inquiry, made this time in low and tear-stifled accents, for which he' seemed to wait before com- mencing his recital. A Erastus, where have you been concealed all this time?" "In a cave in the woods of Croften," he replied. "I have not been out of sight of the chimneys of Bouverie since I left you; that is, I should not have been but for the intervention of the forest, still partially clothed with leaves. Often in my boyhood, I have stood in snow-time on the rising ground above the cave, and seen the dome of Bouverie through the naked branches.  It was comfort to me to remember this even when hidden away in the depths of the cavern.   My old shelter from  storm and cold availed me well in the extremity in which I found myself on the first morning of my flight. Day   broke over me in its vicinity, and fainting nature warned me to proceed no further. I was ill, overpowered with mental and physical wretchedness, and putting aside the dense brushwood that grows about the mouth of the cavern now, and makes it so secure a hiding-place, I went into its depths. I made my bed of the leaves that had drifted in from time to time through the interstices of the undergrowth, and coiled myself upon it, covered with my cloak (yours rather QuintiD and infinitely chill and miserable. I was too ill to eat what food I had about me, and but for the medicine I carried, must have sunk at once under the accumula- tion of evils that crowded thick about me. At last I slept. When I awoke, a cheerful fire of fagots was blazing in one corner of the cave, which partially illumined its walls, and an uncouth lad was standing between me and the flames. He was one of a party of scouts, sent out in pursuit of me, and he had been " promised gold," he said, to find and secure me, so that I might fall into- the hands of Hernshaw. A day-had elapsed, it seemed, since I had left Bouverie ; a day of miserable unconsciousness of time-to me. This much I had gained at least. But to be trapped in a cave after all like a hunted hare, pooh--it was too dispiriting I I raised myself on one arm, and grasped my revolver. The prince of pistols was dry, and in readiness I knew. I pointed it to the unconscious boy, my finger was on the trigger-when" "Oh, grandfather Il"I interrupted; "would you have killed our poor, faithful fool 1"I clasped my hands. "When I reflected," he continued, as if he had not heard me; "that the report might summon those who were without, uncon- scious still, probably, that I had been discovered, I lowered 5 r    106      THEE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. the weapon again, as the thought occurred to mie. There was still time to act. "' What brought you here?' I asked ; -'and how do you know who I am? What makes you suppose that I am Mister Bouverie?' "t 'Oh, I knows you, Master Boobery,' he answered, and he gave some confused account of having crept up a dark ladder, after Fabius, I believe ; and having seen the old ' Play-acter man,' as he called me, 'in his red gownd, and the moono and stars around him ;' and I soon found that he was the idiot grandson of our old cook, Polly McCormick (a child, as I remember him, of whom I had heard you speak so often since, Lilian), and some vague hope of inherited fidelity, as well as avarice, began to animate my bosom. "Boys I said ; ' the officers have offered you gold to find me, and tell them where I am. / I will give you all this ;' and I held up your purse, Quintil, through the open meshes of which the gold sparkled temptingly; ' if you will hide me from them.' "'An't you done hid already?' he asked, with a vague smile, as he peered into my face, 'Who can find you here but the witches? But the gold-you will give me that anyhow,' he added eagerly, extending his hand. "Even in my feeble condition the mixture of the Yahoo primci- ple in the poor, faithful, yet witless element made me laugh. It was a splendid study for the satirist, or mental philosopher. - How Swift would have enjoyed it!  [ "'Yes, boy, if you will stay with me and take care of me, until I am able to go back to Bouverie. I care not who finds me then 1' for, Camilla, I had abandoned all idea at once and forever of further flight, and a determination to bide my fate, had taken full possession of me."   'THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       107 "Oh, Bouverie!" she groaned; " what recklessness you have manifested throughout." "Can you not understand the feeling," he asked, gaily ; " that makes a man walk up to a cannon, when its mouth is pointed to him, and he sees no way of escape? But for your sake, my wife, my daughter, my friend (ay, Quintil, let me call you such), I would not turn on my heel to avoid the severest penalty of the law. There has been a great revulsion of feeling on that subject in my breast lately; but let us not talk of this to-night. Put aside all thought of to-morrow in this happy hour, and believe me, that I have courage now to meet any doom fate has in store for" me. Shall I proceed in my narrative."   Her mute assent en. couraged him ; yet, he paused awhile before he continued. "  My adventures have been few-a trip to the cave of Croften, and back - again, comprises them all. I began to fear, however, that my old safe hiding-place was no secret, after all, until Pat partly reassured me, by telling me he had discovered it accident- ally by trailing a wounded rabbit with his dog ; and that he had entered it now to elude the officers, after losing them in the paw-paw jungle hard by. He only: wanted to rest and warm, as he had often done before, until night should come, so that he might creep out 'unbeknownst,' and go back safely to Bouverie; and'he drew out a crust and a bone, which he offered to share with me, and a few potatoes which he thrust into the fire to roast, and sat down patiently to watch.  "' I keeps my walnuts and hickory-nuts here,' he added, point- ing to a dark pile in one corner; 'and nobody ever steals 'ema be- cause t open sesame " is the word. I hearn Miss Lilian reading  about it to Dame Bianca, and I know it's all true. Shall I fetch Miss Lilian to wait on vou? he said, turning suddenly to me.    108      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VEBRE. "'Not for the world, Pat. No one must know where I am; but you must stay with me as much as you can.' "'I must tell mammy,' he said, after a long fit of musing. ' If I don't, she won't let me come back no more ; and what 'ill I do for victuals if I stay here all the time? I'll go back home, and come again to you, and no one but mammy will know.' "'Tell your mammy what you will, Pat,' I said, in perfect des- peration, and, catching at the clue Lilian had given me to his cha- racter, I added, 'but if you open your mouth to any one else, I will command all my witches to catch you, and peel every particle of your skin off. Do you hear me, Pat i' a I hears you, Master Boobery,' he replied, with unaffected and fearful reverence. "'But, on the contrary, if you hold your tongue, and do what I wish, you shall have the gold,' and I jingled-it before him, so that the red light of the fire flashed over the coins. 'I- am a powerful witch myself, you know, Pat,' I added. 'You saw how easily I threw off the top of the house the other day.' "He seemed, after this, to be absorbed in a fit of deep musing, shaking his head from time to time, and glancing at me. I lost sight of him at this crisis ; a deep sleep fell over me, and, when I waked up, another day had passed-Pat told me this, for my run-- down watch had long been silent-during which he had gone home, and returned in darkness, bringing with him some ' yarbs,' as he called them, which his mammy thought would do me good; some bread and tea, and other simple refreshments. A tin kettle was simmering on the fire, and 1 found myself covered closely with blankets. Great exhaustion had by this time taken posses- sion of me ; I thought myself dying. I dimly recollect struggling against the stream of tea which the lad insisted on pouring down   i     THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEIIE.         109 my throat from the spout of a pitcher, and afterward dozing off under the regular patting of his hands upon my shoulders, and the mysterious hushing of his voice like the buzz or drone of a jews- harp. It is probable that I lost consciousness then for several days. Indeed I remember little more until I commenced to revive as from a deep sleep, and soon afterward knew by sensations of lassitude, and the presence of profuse perspiration, that the fierce fever was broken, under which I had been laboring. "When I commeniced to regain my strength, which was not until after the lapse of weeks, the good creature tempted me with the choicest dainties of your store-room, Camilla, stolen by his mammy's orders, he said, and a few bottles of QuintiPs best port wine, soon brought me to my feet again. I have never been a H   wine-bibber, so wine is the true medicine for me that nature in- tended it to be universally ; but perhaps, after all, the elixir was the best agent in restoring me, as long as it lasted. You must fill my vial again, Lily, from the gallipot in the iron cupboard in the winter bedroom. It is safe, I suppose? But I digress ; let me conclude. To-night, Pat led me home, covered with blankets, and lying, rather than sitting, on Dr. Quintil's gentle horse. I "As we emerged from the forest, a band of mounted men dashed by me ; but, taking me for a woman, probably, in my long wrappings, they did not accost us ; or, perhaps, in their mad haste, did not even perceive us. Yet, Pat tells me, these were Hernshaw and his band." Mt    "They will be here," said my grandmother, "before many days --many hours, perhaps-and arrest is death! Oh, Bouverie, why did you place yourself in such peril again?" and she wrung her hands bitterly. ( Camilla," he said, in a voice of touching tenderness, "again   ir i    110      THE HOUSEHOLD OF 'OUVJlKcIE. I entreat you to suffer me to enjoy the infinite happiness that fills my being to-night, and which is worth to me more than the whole existence of the last twelve years. -There is an essence of time as well as of roses, my love, that compresses years into moments, even as it takes whole gardens to yield a vial of otto.; Such is this night to me." Even as he spoke, alarming symptoms became manifest. It was with difficulty that Dr. Quintil kept off the impending swoon, and recalled his fast fleeting pulse by the use of stimulants and restoratives. "He is exhausted," he said. "Let a bed be prepared--let him rest." "Yes, a Christian bed would seem a paradise to me," he mur- mured, reviving wonderfully under the stimulants that had been administered. "Paradise I after the hard bed of leaves to which my frame has been   consigned of late. But oh, Camilla, not there!" and he pointed upward with a wild energy, and a quiver- ing hand. "Place me no more, I entreat you, in that great lonely room--that living sepulchre, nor on the hearse-like bedstead, where I have spent so many wretched, sleepless nights, haunted by those faces--those terrible shadows, and wrestling -on, like Jacob, till the dawn. Let me lie where I can hear human breathing, and  call on those I love, should the death struggle come over me. You will not refuse me this boon, Camilla?" "Oh, no--no--no, Erastus; for God's sake be calm.   I can- not, cannot bear it-nor can you I1" So speaking, she left the room to make preparations manifestly for his comfort. Bianca had been summoned before, and when I entered my   grandmother's chamber to assist if possible in her arrangements, the attendant was putting the eider-down quilt of   blue satin, he loved for its warmth and lightness, on the couch, which had been stretched before the blazing wood fire for our wanderer's reception., My grandmother was walking the room when I entered, with her head thrown back, and her hands clasped behind it tightly, as if to sustain it, her handkerchief was thrown over her brow and eyes, while bitter groans escaped from her pale and parted lips. It was as if the great deeps of her soul were broken up, and the tempest surged at last with unrestrained power. I had never seen her exhibit emotion like this before, and I shrank from the room appalled. It. jwas not many moments, however, before she followed me, calm, collected, almost cheerful in appearance, as she extended her hand to the worn sufferer in the chair, and offered her assist- ance to lead him to his chamber, and in the low, soft bed, of which I have spoken, we laid his ill and emaciated frame to rest. Throughout that weary night, and many more, we watched beside him, for he was rack-ed with fearful coughing spells, and almost insupportable pangs at intervals, and consumed by fever, which left him toward morning ever languid and exhausted. His present sufferings demanded all our care, and shut away more effectually than aught else could have done our anxiety for the near future so laden with our doom. Thus passed a day' and night, at the expiration of which Bishop Clare came again to Bouverie. "Throw open the window, and glorify the room," said genial Sidney Smith ; and truly as seemed the radiant-revivifying sun'to him did the coming of Bishop Clare appear to us, the sad and grief-bewildered denizens of Bouverie.   "2      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOuu VERIE. Oh! sympathy--oh, genuine, disinterested friendly fellowship, is not your price above rubies? What other salve does earth contain for the wounded spirit or the blight of misfortune? /How could we live and bear our troubles, but for the pitying tenderness of our fellow-creatures?

In the great sorrow- that brooded above us all, Dr. Quintil even clung to him as a little child. One man like this will redeem the charge of perfidy that so many love to bring against their fellow-creatures, with what bitter- show of justice we are all made to feel at one time or another of our lives. What if a few be mean, and false, and ungrateful, and forget. ting noble trust and benefit, embrace the earliest opportunity of bestowing the Judas kiss, or repeating the sin of Peter? Let us not for the sake of such as these repudiate our belief in the existence of sublime sentiments and fast fidelity. Whatever a man feels in his own breast, that also let him believe may be met with among his fellow-men, whether of good or evil. \ I have no power to say "I would give my life for my ffiend," and disbelieve another man who makes the same assertion, any more than a murderer, by the very molding of his nature, would be permitted to discredit the existence of a fellow-Cain.

The recreant to friendship wants opportunity only to betray'his country and his God! And when I speak of friendship, I mean  X that noble fidelity of affection that forsakes not the unfortu- nate, nor the misguided, even though the whole world forsakes X them. I mean that patience that forbears; that tenderness that for- V gives; that mercy that extenuates; and wanting these, there is i no sacredness in friendship, no meaning in the word.   ,rm    114      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. ! CHAPTER V. WITH that wonderful vitality, which seemed in his case almost a physical will, my grandfather rallied, when hope was nearly extinct-if hope indeed might be called that mixed emotion with which we regarded his condition-and was able again to enjoy the social intercourse afforded him by the presence of those he loved, and even to speak with renewed energy of his plans for the future. His sanguine temperament, momentarily relieved from the pressure of pain, rose with a sudden rebound that went far beyond any possibility that existence contained for him, and saddened those who had craved for his last hours a meeker mood, a more earnest recognition of his true state, temporal and eternal. He would soon be well enough to leave Bouverie, he thought;, and journey by slow stages to the Atlantic coast. There would be no difficulty in arranging this transportation. He had a plan that would baffle any detective, that he would make plain when ready to put' it into practice. He would take ship as soon as possible for a group of islands in the Pacific Ocean, on one of which he had lingered spell-bound for days, when sent out on a scientific voyage by government. It was there that he would lay down his hearthstone, and begin a new life, surrounded by all he loved. His brilliant imagination revelled in describing this lovely land, with all its resources of fertility, scenery, and climate. He gave, with wonderful effect, those verses of Tennyson, from  THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERtIE.    -   115 Locksley Hall," which present so exquisite a picture of a tropic island. He spoke of the natives, few and kindly, as fit proselytes for Bishop Clare; yes, he should go, we will all go, and form an Utopian colony and be happy and prosperous, and great together. He would build a palace large enough to contain us -all, a kind of mimic Alhambra, beautiful exceedingly ; the walls and ceilings of which should be relieved with branches of coral, unchanged by the hand of man, and the floors paved with lava. The balmy and elastic air was life-giving, and his bleeding lungs would -heal kindly under its genial influence. Bishop Clare, even, should-grow young again, and life, long happy life, should still be ours i He painted his glowing pictures with a master's hand. It was almost impossible at times to resist the earnestness of his convic- tions. He did not seem to look upon, his arrest, should it take place at all, as a matter of more than temporary inconvenience. Some strange obliquity in his nature, prevented his mental vision from embracing his true position, whether before God or man. Like all sophists he had persuaded himself, that what he wished for was right and even possible. He did not look in the face the offended majesty of the law, nor hear the awful verdict ringing in his ears: "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed 1" And- while we trembled at every approaching footstep, every shadow on the threshold, he- remained composed and almost defiant before the danger that menaced him continually. At times I fancied that he enjoyed a sense of relief in the feeling, that concealment was no longer practicable ; arid that to be again the acknowledged centre of his family, even for a few days, was more   ^   116      'EITHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVE IE. precious to him than years of such existence as he had known in the upper chambers of Bouverie ; a fleshy ghost whose claims to humanity were ignored by law, and tolerated only by his own household. In the temporary freedom from suffering that he enjoyed, my grandfather did not forget his promise to Pat McCormick, nor his obligations to the dame. He counted out from the pile of gold the bishop had brought him, the exact number of coins con- tained in Dr. Quintil's purse, and bestowed them on Pat, who did not fail to exact the purse also (the meshes of which, woven of green and silver, had particularly pleased his fancy), as part of the contract. During all his years of concealment, Dame McCormick had never seen her master, though cognizant of his presence in the house. He had been her idol from boyhood, yet she had never breathed his name through that long ten years' captivity ; wait- ing anxiously, it seemed, in the hope that he would ask for her some day. That day had come, and she looked upon the wreck of her poor old doting dream. There was a woful stare on her haggard face as she stood by the couch, and clasped the long bony fingers of its occupant. Once she lifted her knotty left hand to shade her eyes, as if to reassure herself of the truth of the vision before her; then timidly extending it, touched the extreme, ends of the long steel grey locks spread over the pillow, and withdrew it again with a deep-drawn sigh. "You find me changed, Polly," he said, understanding the sorrowful pantomime. "And it's better, I am, Master Erastus," she replied, with a little sudden courtsey. "She does not hear you, grandfather," I whispered, account-   ing thus for her erratic answer. "She is stone-deaf, as the say- ing is.2" "My God, how hideous she has grown!" he- murmured, as he withdrew his hand with a fastidious disgust, that did not escape her attention. "Does the soul always turn inside out in this way, I wonder, in old age? If so, how shall I look at seventy, Lily? Nay, how must I look even now?" "Oh, grandfather P" "Tell her to go, chijd; and give her that gold-rimmed eye- glass, if you choose; anything to please her, so that she goes speedily, and I never, never see her again 1"He waved his hand. She understood the signal, perhaps, for when I turned toward the place she had occupied to give her the eye-glass, as he de- sired, she was gone. A moment's consideration, however, showed me a better substitute. A shell snuff-box lay on the stand-beside him, and cramming this with the gold-pieces that were still piled there, I went after her, "Lily," he cried; "this -is sheer extravagance, not to be thoughti of; come ;back \           ' ' No, grandfather, the poor old creature shall have what she loves most, for nothing else, not even this perhaps, can heal the wound you have inflicted. Let me give her the gold." "Do as you will, then, but remember we shall want a great deal of money for our travelling expenses-our tropical flight, you know. I hurried away. Bianca, who, it 1may be remembered, had ever held him in aversion, was now my grandfathers constant attendant. She I1  "8      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU'VERIE.  was certainly most dutiful in her ministry; but I remarked that she never lifted her eyes to his face, and spoke to him as seldom as possible. Her Spanish nature rose up against him with its implacable tenacity of sorrowful resentment, and to her he could never be again other than the destroyer of her husband's life. Oh, God I how heavily the current of lost human life was set- ting against him now! That life he worshipped so, as an abstract thing, had so adored in his own veins, yet so recklessly disregarded when it came between him and his purpose, whatever that might be. What a strange mixture he was of hardness and tenderness, of persuasive gentleness, of unscrupulous cruelty, of delicate and lofty refinement, and of more than savage treachery and tyranny I How entirely the word "fascinating" fitted him whose manner was full of witchery, overcoming as it did in all who knew him, that instinctive warning that rises up in the heart of most men in the presence of evil I Yet warped, as he undeniably was, I do him the injustice to speak of him as wholly evil. His eyes had never rested with impure glances on a woman's face, his self-love had never led him to take pecuniary advantage of any man, nor his lofty position to depart from  courtesy toward his meanest dependent. These things were born in him, with the noble blood that on one side at least flowed through his veins ; they were instincts that he blindly obeyed-he was thus far a gentleman. For the rest he had cultivated the Eugene Aram spirit, until his sophistry knew no limits, and his hand had been tainted more than once I fear with the crowning sin of humanity. It will be seen hereafter, what peculiar passion had fostered this destructive element, and there may be some who, after reading these pges,   will arise from their perusal with the comforting conviction that Erastus Bouverie was a madman I But I who knew him well, know also that there could be no question in his case of mania, unless indulged propensity be worthy of the name. I who idolized him have no such excuse to offer.' The splendid fabric of his mind was built above an. earthquake, and might at any moment have rocked to ruin from the beginning ; the ruin not of madness but of wrong doing. Insanity was impossible with him in the very nature of things. There was something too coolly impetuous, too philosophic, too self-contained, too sarcastic in his turn of mind to assume the shape of madness, even when most perverted. It is a common error to suppose that insanity and imagination go oftenest together. I for one have rarely seen them allied. The boiler seldom bursts that possesses a safety valve.' The inmates of lunatic asylums are usually persons of finely strung nerves and limited ideality, the most unfortunate of all combina- tions. It is the effort of the dumb to speak that oversets the brain. When imagination is true it is very stable, as well as very demonstrative. Could anything have driven Yoltaire crazy? Was :not Byron the coolest of practical self-lovers? Who so rational as epicurean Tom Moore? Who so real as loyal Walter Scott?   Who so self-poised as Wordsworth  and Southey?  Overwork did indeed soften the brain of some of these,'but that might come from any continuous exertion ; nursing the sick, setting up type, reading too continuously, digesting ill, being annoyed by debt, puzzling out problems. Madness is a thing apart from this physical condition, as I consider it. The idea of    120      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVaIE. Pope going crazy, or Shakspeare, or old Sam Johnson, queer as he was, seems so preposterous that it makes one smile to think of it. And as for Charles Lamb, the home hero of the age, the here- ditary taint took the form of genius with him evidently, and found its safety valve thus,or he might have been as wild as Bridget Elia. Cowper, too, was half saved from madness by his genius alone. There stands before me, as well as I can remember, but one exception to this ordinary rule in the history of the gifted, in the person of Dean Swift. He rises to my imagination like a gigantic blasted oak-tree, standing out lone and lightning scathed in the midst of a bare and desolate heath, a mystery and a warn- ing. Some cleaving curse was there. But I will not continue a theme so distasteful, nor stand longer, scalpel in hand, trying to dissect a character so inscrutable as that of the hero of this story. Has it not fallen to the lot of some who read these pages, to meet in their own peculiar walk of life a nature of which his may stand for a type at least? Is he the only man who has consumed gold in the furtherance0 of selfish pursuits, that rightfully belonged to those around him? Is he the only man who has sacrificed his enemies unscrupulously, and thrown shadow and mysterious wretchedness over the hearts of his friends? Is he alone in having been a fascinating egotist, courteous yet crushing in all of his requisitions? Is the want of self-reproach, and conscientious scruple that existed in his case peculiar to him, or a part of all self-worship? To those who reject him as a reality let him stand as a repre- sentative at least of a class of men not common in our country aw yet, but indissolubly connected with all societies where refine-   ment and sophistry make an artificial atmosphere around the human soul. Whoever reads these pages, will read the work of one no longer among the living, and in whose veins will perish the last drop of the blood of Bouverie. Something of the great spirit of truth and disinterestedness with which we must appear before the judgment bar is infused, I think, in all narratives between whose publication and their author the grave must throw its interposing shadow.   X With any other feeling than this at work it would be inex- cusable in me to portray things precisely as they were, or to undertake such examination into character and motives as I find myself pursuing now. Yet some idea of my devoted love for him I censure and scru- tinize, may be formed from the assertion I am about to make--- incredible and monstrous as it might seem to many, true as it cer- tainly :is. I hold myself perfectly willing in spirit, as I would have done in flesh, to share any punishment of Erastus Bouverie that eternal justice may yet conceive necessary for that final expiation, if by such division of suffering I may shorten his term of probation, or assuage his sorrowful remorse, even by one hour, one pang. For such is my comprehension of the fire hereafter, and the torture of the offender against divine patience, and such my understanding of all deep affection worthy of the name.   122      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOV VVElE. CHAPTER 'VI. FIVE days had passed since the return of the fugitive, yet were we undisturbed-a matter of surprise to all but one of our house. hoid. 'The excitement has died away," my grandfather said, one day. "Even that scamp, Smith, has relented, or come at last to a sense of his true interests. Lily, I shall be suffered to die in peace." "I trust so, dear grandfather," I said, weeping, as I clasped his extended hand. "Pshaw, child, crying again! Why, what a literalist you are I Don't you see how much better I am-how much stronger? I ate a pint of jelly to-day, the food of athletes, you know, and I shall be on my feet again, as vigorous as a panther, before two- weeks. Then we must get away from this place. If the worst comes to the worst, I will go disguised as Mrs. Smith." ' What an idea, grandfather," I said, in as cheerful a voice as I could command. "We^ have only to outhid the governor, you know, to secure Smith's services again. I have a great mind to send for the fellow, and have a talk with him, and bring him to a sense of his duty. I think I could whistle him back again readily enough, and then a golden chain would do the rest, and bind him fast, you know. My plan would be to take him as my travelling com- panion, for a time." I listened in silence-there was no use in arguing about so fatile a scheme.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUERIE      .  123 "Mrs. Smith is tall and thin, Lily, I believe; about my figure, is she not?" with a grim, satiric smile. Yes, as far as stature goes, nearly so ; -but the hair, grand- father, and the squint, and the ferrety red eyes. What will you do with these?"' "Oh, a veil, Lily-a deep blue veil-doubled like that you wear to protect your complexion when you run out in the grounds; that will do the business completely. I flatter myself I am not unlike, in general mien and bearing, the gardener's consort, and, with a little practice, could succeed, I fancy, in imitating some of her ladylike peculiarities." His eye glittered with laughter. "Patience, dear grandfather! do not talk of this. Let us rely rather on the forbearance of our fellow-creatures, this time, and the incalculable love and mercy of God." He groaned and turned away.  Alas! I knew not then that the precincts of Bouverie were strictly guarded, and that it was to Governor Staunton's merciful -wish to spare our feelings that we owed this temporary security. I knew not that my grandfather's convalescence, should it ever take place--and to the wonderful recuperative powers-of his con- stitution no change seemed impossible-would be the signal for fresh intrusion on the part of the police, and the certain arrest of him who, in the eyes of the law, stood forth a condemned criminal. As he grew better-for he certainly did improve rapidly for some days, after his first severe attack was over-he resumed his old habit of reading voraciously whatever came in his way. I found himn, on one occasion, turning the last leaf of "Morley Emrn- stein "--then a late publication, I believe. "It is a beautiful allegory, Lilian," he said, "and treated with much delicacy and power."    124      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVux z. E. "Allegory, grandfather I I have not looked upon it in this  light."                             1 "Certainly, child-there is but one hero. The good and evil genius of a human soul are typified as Morley Ernstein, and  Count Lieberg.  After a time the baffled fiend disappears, and the good angel triumphs. It was otherwise with me," he added, in low accents. "The dark spirit had it all his own way in my case. My God-if such there be-why was this  permitted?" Hie remained mute after these words, with his eyes closed, and  his hands clasped. I might have believed, had I not known him too well, that he was engaged in prayer. However 'it was, he   j wrestled mentally, that was evident, and sorely too, for the cold -  drops of perspiration gemmed his brow.  In consequence of communications made to Bishop Clare and  Dr. Quintil by Jasper, who had informed himself of the active sur- j veillance held over Bouverie, it was determined that the planj agitated once before, should now be carried out, and that an ap-  peal on my grandfather's behalf should be again made to Governor ij Staunton. This measure was concluded on, without the consent   j or even knowledge of the person most interested, as the only course remaining open to his friends, and steps were taken to put  it into immediate effect.  A petition was drawn up by Dr. Quintilian, and signed by all  the inmates of Bouverie. My grandmother then requested Bishop Clare to become its bearer.  "No, Camilla," he replied, advancing to the sofa on which  I was sitting by Jasper, and extending his hands toward us as if j in benediction; "I depute this office to that youthful pair.  There is strength in youth, and- innocence, and beauty, to move-a 9s   heart that might be steeled against all appeals firom age and its dreary attendants:" "It would ill become Luther's , son," broke in Dr. Quintilian, "to appear in such a cause I If needs be, Lilian must go alone." He spoke angrily, his calm eye flashed, and he waved his hand, as if puttingo the suggestion Bishop Clare had made fiercely aside. I rose, and approached him. I "Let it be as you have said. I will go alone, if you think it best." He was walking the floor rapidly now, but stopped, as I laid my hand on his arm, and looked into his face. It was much agitated. "No, Lily, no-that would never do," he whispered, huskily. At this moment I felt Jaspers arm encircling me, and learned his determination first from its firm pressure, and, later, from the rapid' gesture of dissent he made to Dr. Quintil. "Not such were the teachings of Christ, your Master, and mine, Paul Quintilian," spoke out Bishop Clare. i' Has nature no voice-must she never be heard? must a man's whole life be spent in crushing out the mighty instincts given to him by his God as his birthright?  Do years of self-denial go for nothing, that fresh sacrifice is demanded every day.? You go too far in the exercise of your priestly functions, sir I You ask the impossible-you press me to the wall, Bishop Clare, and I turn at the utmost limits." He had thrown off my hand unconsciously, and, in another moment, had left the room. My grandmother was in tears, Jasper cold and stern, the bishop confounded. I, only, I think, entered into his feelings, and comr passionated his struggle,           p.'"   126      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. But nothing would have induced me to accept the companion. ship of Jasper, without his full consent -who had devoted- his life to him as few fathers would have done. It was in vain that Jasper urged his perfect right to act as he pleased in the matter, and his duty to my grandmother and to me as paramount to any other. I was inflexible ; and it was arranged at last that I should go- with Bishop Clare, and present the petition as the nearest relative of the unfortunate Master of Bouverie. The subject was not suggested again to Dr. Quintilian, and Jasper, I knew, had his own resolutions formed, from the peculiar expression of his face, and the increased rigidity of his always too firmly compressed lips; lips that had never been agitated by a sound, nor relaxed by a burst of laughter. A few days more passed rapidly away, during which the simple preparations for my short journey were completed; for the capital town in which Governor Staunton resided was only twenty miles distant from Bouverie. And now the eve of that day had arrived, on which the im- portant step was to be undertaken. Still the uncle and nephew had come to no understanding, and my fears for the result of what I knew Jasper's course would be, almost overpowered me. Could Dr. Quintilian forgive such open rebellion as he meditated? Would the old fond feeling ever be revived between them, should this occur? I confess I trembled for its consequences. How greatly I was relieved need not be asserted when I received the following note, handed me by Bianca, who marvelled when she saw me weeping. "Has anything more occurred,. dear Miss Lilian," sho said, as I hastily wiped off the tears, and folded away the pre- cious lines   .   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVn:Rm..   12i7 "Oh, nothing, nothing, Bianca ; only I am very grateful, very happy, indeed. Dr. Quintil consents that Jasper shall go with me to entreat for my grandfather." "Oh, is that all, Miss Lilian?" she bridled slightly, and mut- tered as she left me. "I thought Dr. Quintil was more a man of his word than that comes to. Jasper, indeed! Time enough, I think, when he comes to his speech again, that he robbed him of to" Her words grew inarticulate as the door interposed between us; but her grumbling voice was heard for some moments more before it died away. Then I drew out again and reread the dear characteristic note, more fondly than ever did maiden passionate love-letter, or graceful billet-doux: "Dear Lilian," it ran ; "I have come to my senses at last, and look upon matters with the eye of a Christian, I trust, after days of bitter disquietude. Child, child, may you never have to wrestle with malignant feelings as I have done, or find such diffi. culty in conquering the serpents of your heart. "I see plainly now, that it is simply Jasper's duty as a man and a gentleman to go with you, who are more than life to him. I have very nearly reduced him to the sin of disobedience, I fear, against his father's representative on earth by the perverse course I have been pursuing. I am heartily ashamed of myself, and regret the past. But I say this to you and Jasper only, I have no such concessions to make to your grandmother, or Bishop Clare. "Enough ; I withdraw all objection to Jaser's presentation of the petition. Yet, for the first time in my life, I confess, Lilian, that I rejoice that his poor lips are sealed.

EARLY in the forenoon of a fine December day, Pat McCormick led two caparisoned horses to the front of the house of Bouverie, and stood patiently awaiting the coming forth of their -riders. One of these horses was a stately coal-black ereature, of Andalu- sian breed, with the quivering nostril, the kindling eye, the small and lofty head that speak so unmistakably of blood and pedigree. He was equipped with a lady's saddle, and scarlet reins, and had been my birthday present from Dr. Quintil, in the month of May in that year, when I celebrated my eighteenth anniversary of life. He called him "Ivanhoe."  The other horse was the doctor's own gentle, but strong and steady beast ; bay in color, heavy and compact in form, and fitted either for saddle or harness ; "Cedric " by name. He had been caparisoned for Jasper's use, his own beautiful grey mare, "Violet Fane," having been badly lamed some weeks before, at the time of his ride after Bishop Clare. It was a frosty, sunshiny day, bracing and beautiful, and some- thing of the character of the weather had infused itself into my veins, I believe, for I never felt more calm, more strong, more courageous, than when I undertook that journey. Alas! before it ended, doubt and weariness, and despondency bhad replaced these exhilarating sensations! Dr. Quintil helped me to the saddle. "You look like victory herself, this morning, Lilian," he said; "God speed you, darling." He wrung Jasper's hand. "You will go," he said, -" to-night, to the house of lAr. Clavering, and give him this letter; it explains everything. Se lives so   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVl ERIE.      129 quietly, he may not have heard of this matter at all. I think he will sign our petition, and I know that in old times he was beloved by Staunton. Be this as it may, he will receive you kindly for my sake, and to-morrow you can proceed to finish your mission. I think, Jasper, you remember his residence; we were once there together. Take care of Lilian; farewell, and once again, God speed you both." He waved his hand. We bounded off, and soon losing sight of the green lawn, and white chimneys, and dome of Bouverie, - we found ourselves on the high road leading to the capital, whither tended our pilgrimage. Before I left my chamber, I had stood for a few moments sur- veying my appearance in the psyche glass it contained, with an innocent satisfaction that I recall now with a smile, not derisive, I hope, as if the young girl who thought herself so fair in her dark green habit, and grey beaver bat, weighed down with sweeping plumes, under which heavy braids of brown hair wer) brought low on her crimson cheek and arching neck, were other than the pale, grave woman who writes these pages, dressed in mourning garments of woe and widowhood. Yet, smile as I will, I cannot disown the identity of these two, even while I disclaim the joy- ous vanity of youth and energy. The same devoted heart beats in my bosom now as on that glorious winter morning, and for the self-same objects, the same deep love controls me that nerved me then to dare and to encounter fatigue and adventure for the sake of those dear to me, and to feel that the sun shining above us was not more life-giving, more effulgent than the face of him who rode beside me.  What if the shadows of green graves lie between us now, and the world, like a great panorama, passes before me, only a sojourner and a spectator therein? The time 6*   130.      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. will not be long, however lengthened my life may be, before thr eternal hand shall gather together and unite forever the scattered elements, dead and living, that composed the household of Bou- verie, and I try to remember that my noble grandmother esteemed patience a "God-like quality," and the apostle among poets has said, thinking evidently with her, "Those also serve who only stand and wait." The lamps were burning in the streets of --- , when we rode wearily through them, not having left our saddles since we sprang into them at Bouverie, nor broken bread since morning. The, I esidence of Mr. Clavering was in a remote suburb of the town, a dark grey mansion, cloister-like in its appearance, surrounded with old trees, and inclosed with stone walls, surmounted with iron railings. A brisk summons at the gate brought after a time an old servant to the door, shading a light with her hand. "She looks like the hag in the cave of Gil Blas in your pic- ture, Jasper," I said. "I am afraid of her." Dismounting hastily from my horse, and leaving the reins in his hand, I went up the steps to make known our-wish to see Mr. Clavering. "We are from Bouverie," I said ; "tell him so, and let some one see to our horses. Mr. Quintilian is holding them."' "Deil a body is there to see to onything here but me and the master," she said. "The beasts maun go to the stables, and Jasper maun tak' um his ain setl." "Jasper I how do you know his name?"I asked. "This is strange indeed." She laughed a sort of chirruping, fairyish laugh. "He gev me twa pieces of gold to sit for him," she said, "whilst he painted me as a witch, I believe, and never spak once   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BO U   rE.     131 while he was employed for good or bad. A silent chiel he is. But come in off the steps, and Mister Jasper, just proceed, if you please, to the near leevery, while I tak' the young leddy into the master's study." So saying, she drew me in the hall, and shut the door. "This way, Miss Bouverie, this way, if you please; don'ts stumble now; the place is littered up a little, for the master always goes in the back gate, and ye mind we see little or no company."              . "Miss de Courcy," I said, loftily. "Tell Mr. Clavering my name before I enter. I am Lilian de Courcy.7" "O Gude sakes, what a name 1   Did ye cam' from the auld country, lassie, and are you of the auld blood?" and so question- ing, she threw open the door of a small but brilliantly illumi nated apartment. The only inhabitant of this room, evidently the master so often referred to, sat comfortably ensconced in a great cushioned chair, by a table piled with folios and fossils. He was a spare, tall man, evidently approaching middle age, grave-looking and slightly bald, yet decidedly handsome, with the remains of soft, waving dark hair, falling in almost womanish locks about his cheeks. He rose to receive me, still slightly mystified, apparently by my unexpected appearance, with a shy and stately courtesy peculiar  to the refined who live greatly alone, and possessing a strange charm for me whenever I observe it.           , ' Sit down, Miss de Courcy," he said, placing a chair for me opposite his own, and near the blazing coal fire, and bending his calm, inquiring eyes upon my face. I stretched my hands and weary feet with almost childish eagerness to receive its hospitable warmth. I did not reflect for a moment how strange my advent   132      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. must seem in his house, forgetting, that my name was probably unknown -to him, and that the letter of explanation was still-in Jasper's pockethook. "I am cold," I said, "and weary, having ridden a long way, and ill I believe, at least giddy," leaning back with a feeling of utter wretchedness, while my whole position flashed suddenly be- fore me with mortifying distinctness. I burst into irrepressible tears of mingled pain and mortification, and sobbed bitterly for a few moments. Old Janet approached me, so I believe did her bewildered -master. "Dinna greet, lassie," she said, kindly. "The youth, Jasper, will soon come back. She is from Bouverie, Mr. Clavering,^ added she, addressing herself to him, " and the young man has ta'en the horses to the leevery. Dr. Quintil's nephew, I mean- the painter laddie, ye maun remember." "Is it possible 1" said Mr. Clavering, with real concern. "Is this Mr. Bouverie's grand-daughter, of whom my friend Dr. Q'uin. tilian has spoken so often? Forgive me, dear young lady, I had no clue to your name or errand here before.9 "I am so weak," I said, looking up and smiling in his face, "so nervous, I am quite ashamed; but the long ride, and the very awkward position in which Jasper's absence has left me, must plead for me." He took my hand, and murmured a few words ; then suddenly dropping it, conferred apart with Janet, who disappeared, re" entering a few moments later with coffee, and a chafing dish of toast. I had leaned back again in my chair in the interval, quite faint.: and overcome, and he sat quietly waiting for me to revive under the influence of the much needed refreshments of the steam, ing mocha. I drank it eagerly.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF'BOUVERIE.        133 "I am quite myself -again,"' I said, putting the cup aside; -    al thank you, no toast yet, dame," as Janet pressed the food upon me. "I will eat after a while, if you please, when Jasper comes. - He, too, is weary and fasting." "And here he is at last,7' said Mr. Clavering, answering the brisk sound of the bell himself, and leading Jasper in, a moment afterward, quite triumphantly. The letter was read while we partook together of the hospitable fare-to which Janet made substantial additions--read with a grave and earnest aspect, and a slight trembling- of the expressive lips. Mr. Clavering laid it aside and alluded to it no more that night, as was best for all; but before retiring he calmly affixed his signature to the petition inclosed within. "Time is the best expiation," were the remarkable words he spoke as he returned it to Jasper. Words that bore a whole world of mercy and of hope for the offender here and hereafter, if true in themselves, and briefly revealed his own opinions on the great subject of human punishment. Shall I ever forget that evening, prolonged as it was, uncon- sciously by all, beyond midnight, and full to overflowing with the delightful remark and reminiscence of one who was a host in more significations than one? Was it possible, I thought later, that we had never known Mr. Clavering before? Was he not rather an old and life-long acquaintance, knit to us by ties of habit,  taste, and affection I What a charm there was in his mild, frank deferential manner, in the expression of his large, beaming eyes, in the infinite sweetness of his slow, sad, unfrequent smile. How fine were the tones of his .voice, what a ring of true coin there was about them ; how just, now noble his sentiments ; how lofty and deep his ideas, how profound his culture I I was lost in admirae v.   134     THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VERIE. tion. Accustomed as I -had been to vigorous thought and bril. liancy of imagination, and extensive information in the minds around me, I had not yet met with one that seemed to unite all these qualifications of greatness in such perfect equipoise. And yet this man lived alone, and devoted his mental energies to the investigation of old bones and uninteresting rocks, and petrified animal remains, and prided himself (with all those intellectual riches I have mentioned) on the poor title of first geologist of his State I He who was born a poet, who might have been a statesman I "What painting are you employed on now, Jasper?" he asked ; "I know you are never idle." "I am painting a Magdalene," was the answer. "The subject is exhausted, Jasper,"  said Mr. Clavering. "Think of the many Magdalenes that the piety or superstition of the old masters has given to the world ;;' and he ran over with surprising facility a list of these, giving as he went, a few words to each, descriptive of its peculiarity of style or expression, and ending by preferring one of which I -had never heard before. "The work of one Battoni, a life-sized picture in the gallery of Dresden ; not so remarkable for executive power as beauty of con- ception, an angelic calmness being diffused over the whole exqui- site figure, which lies at length upon the ground, reading an open Bible." "Describe your Magdalene to Mr. Clavering, Jasper-"I said, with a feeling of natural pride. He smiled, but wrote as I requested. "Mine is a modern Magdalene,", he began; "I have discarded the old idea entirely of voluptuous fullness and mere physical beauty. I have tried to merge all expression in one of penance and rapt religion. The picture is a small one, of the   THE HOUrSEHOLD OF BOUVJBIE.       135 Cabinet or Wilkie size. It represents the moment when Mary, after pouring the ointment on the Saviour's feet in the house of Simon the Leper, sits humbly on the ground before him. The hair with which she has wiped his feet, hangs long and lank around her emaciated figure, pale, brown, and massive. Her clasped hands inclose her knees, her face is bowed nearly over them; in the hands alone have I permitted a suggestion of the original beauty of form to appear, otherwise concealed by the dark blue dress she wears. The forehead is thin and spacious; the large blue eyes sunken and dim, looking out as if on space, transfixed by the promised hope and glory beyond the world. The outline of the nose is G(reek, with the thin, dilating nostril, expressive of spirit and sensibility. The cheeks are worn, the lips despairing and partly open, showing the square cut corners and   original fullness of form, which we can but associate with impulse, and even imagination, such as must have been hers. though merged at one time into sensuality by the force of educa- tion and circumstance only, we must believe. For the nature of Magdalene was tender and noble, poetic even, we have reason to think, from the glimpses we have of her, and the devoted charac. ter of her pure and perfect love for Christ. There are other figures of which I  will not speak now, having barely sketched them in; but that of Magdalene is nearly finished, and is meant to be the principal one of the group." "I like your conception," said Mr. Clavering, " and I hope I shall like your execution as well, Jasper.. Did you finish Silenus?" "No," said Jasper, smiling, signifying the word by a shake of the head, then writing rapidly: "Bishop Clare objected to the picture because I  had beguiled poor Father Conrad, unintention.   136      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. ally, I assure you, with the idea that I was about to paint him as 'St. Silenus,' and he had consequently made himself so ridiculous in the convent by reporting that he was to be painted 'by that pious young artist, Jasper Quintilian, as the most worthy and notable Greek saint Silenus, seated on an ass,' that for the best interests of religion, Bishop Clare begged me to desist, at least until the matter was forgotten." "The old man is ignorant and even sensual," said Mr. Claver- ing, " at least in his love for the table ; but he is useful in -his way, and controls the Irish around us in a manner that benefits the citizens generally. Otherwise I should vote him a nuisance." "You are no Catholic, I know, Mr. Clavering," wrote Jasper; "no friend to the institution at least." "I think," said Mr. Glavering, smiling slowly, " that we do too much confound this religion with its abuses. It is very compre- hensive, it meets every requirement of human nature, physical or spiritual. 'If I were not Alexander, I would be Parmenio?." "I understand you. If you were not a Unitarian, you would be a Catholic. Yours is a cold belief, that suits better a geologist than a poet or a painter ; and yet I believe you, too, are one of these." "The time is past, O Jasper! the time is past when' golden exhal- ations of the dawn,' made my path radiant, and when, dove-like, over a waste of waters the sweet spirit of poetry brooded in my breast. Sorrow, such as befalls few men, crushing, obliterating, sudden, was succeeded by that secondary state of happiness in which routine and occupation insure tranquillity, and even peace, a word of wider signification. The compromise' with grief was gladly accepted. I am thankful to the mighty consideration of him who suffers substitution like this, yet I do not believe that I   THE HOUSEHOLD  OF BOUVEIIE.      137 have enjoyed such life as my original capacity might have grasped. I have sat frugally at a board of bread and water (spiritually speaking), understanding well that a goblet of wine and the deli- cate fruits of the earth- would have filled my table and needs better. Had I written out my own heart as Byron did, I might have been esteemed a poet still; but I shrank from this. I covered close the outcries of its agony,..as Othello controlled those of Desdemona, and in the smothered strife imagination died like her a violent death. Jasper-Miss de Courcy-it was my inex- pressible grief to have occasioned the death of the woman who was to have been my wife." He hesitated a moment, then went on in low, sorrowful tones. "We were sailing together on a summer lake, by mismanagement of mine the boat was upset, and she was lost-' drowned-drowned 1' as Shakspeare has it," he said bitterly, "and Hoh, my God!-by no act of my own, thou knowest well, was shamefully rescued!" He rose, he walked to the window, and looked out upon the night through the parted curtains. When he returned, all traces of emotion had disappeared from his calm, grave counte- nance. "The only question that remains to be solved now, Jasper, is the one of fate," he said with perfect composure. "Was this intended and predestined, was it accident? On the solution of this enigma hangs the happiness, earthly and eternal, of Ernest Clavering." "It was fate i"I answered impulsively. He had not addressed himself to me, but Jasper made no reply. "Your destiny. Ac- cept it, Mr. Clavering, and b}e happy." "Why what a Calvinist you would make, Miss de Courcy?" he said, half smiling at my earnest advocation. of my favorite doe.   138      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. trine. "Yet it is a comfort to hear this instinctive counsel from your lips, for surely with one so young, it could scarcely be a matter of deep consideration. And now," taking down a new volume from his book-case, "I will read you what Mr. Bulwer, the most fascinating and metaphysical of novelists, says on this /subject, in this beautiful work of his," and he read with striking power and beauty "The Vision of Arbaces," in the "Last days of Pompeii," then among the latest works of the author. I can give but a glimpse of this evening, so memorable to me. The impression of pleasure it conveyed seemed not to have been made on my heart alone, as shall be seen hereafter. I number yet, I hope ever to number, Mr. Clavering among my few friends (the word has a deep sacredness to me), and if I give in these pages an insight into deeper feelings on his part, it is not for the gratification of vanity or woman's pride, but merely to fulfill the truth. I had put aside for one evening the burdensome anticipation of the morrow, and yielded my being fully to the current of social enjoyment; but *hen the morning broke, with the recurring con- sciousness of the task that lay before me, I rose sorrowful and pale, as a prisoner on the day of execution. I could not eat, nor speak, save in monosyllables, at the breakfast board, but Mr. Clavering, with native delicacy, neither pressed the one upon me, nor gave occasion for the other; yet I felt that his calm observant eye was upon me often, with an expression of solicitude and compas- sion. He had caused our horses to be brought to us while we breakfasted, and when they were announced he did not seek to detain us a moment, merely requesting us to return to his house and take refreshment after the interview, if possible, and pressing our hands with a murmured blessing as we parted.   THE HOUSEHOLD T OF :BOUVERIE.      139 CHTAPTER VIII. THE residence of the governor was a little beyond the town limits, and lay in an opposite direction from Mr. Clavering's abode. It was placed at some distance from the road in a finely wooded park, through which walks and drives were cut, and beyond which lay greenhouses, and gardens, and meadows, bounded by the blue, distant, curving river. Nothing could be more cheerful than the aspect of this residence to an unprejudiced eye. No prison-house in a narrow city court could have seemed more gloomy, more rvepellent to mine. As it broke upon my view from a sudden turn of the road, pointed out by Jasper, a feeling of the crushing responsibility resting on us fell over me, and a-blind mis- giving made me sick and faint-hearted. "Oh, Jasper!"I said, " we have undertaken too much ; we shall fail, we shall fail! I have no words for an occasion like this. Go on with the petition, and leave me here ; I shall only embarrass you." We were now standing by the gate, lofty and, massive, and it was necessary he should dismount to open it. Before leaving his horse, he turned and gazed steadfastly, almost reproachfully at me, pressed his hand on his heart and lips, pointed to heaven, shook his head mournfully, and then calmly proceeded to open the leaves of the gate, and led the horses through, for I had dropped my reins, atd now held my hands pressed tightly over my face, feeling as I did the full force of his rebuke. As I heard the leaves of the gate clash together behind us, it   "O      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VEKIE. seemed to say to n e, with its harsh, grating sound, "There is no retreating now ; your fate incloses you." I rallied with a strong effort, took the reins from Jasper's hands, and cantered through the grounds by his side, gathering courage and dream-like compo- sure at every step that brought me nearer to certainty. I scarcely knew how to command myself to dismount calmly and enter the house, and even give our names to the attendant. The governor was at home, and we were ushered at once into his presence. He was standing on the rug of the drawing-room or hearth as we entered, engaged in reading a newspaper. Chairs placed in a circle around the blazing coal fire, showed that he had not been long alone; the occupants had probably gone out on hearing of  the approach of "strangers on important business," for thus we had heralded ourselves. He advanced toward us with extended hands as we reached the middle of the room, and, with a face beaming with cordial/ kind- ness said, "Give me your names, my young friends-my servant announced them indistinctly; and, if my memory serves me, we have not met before."           i  I could not speak to him for the stricture in my throat; and, for all answer, Jasper placed the petition in his outstretched hands, instead of accepting them in greeting. He took it gravely, scrutinized the direction, stepped back to his standing- place on the rug, waved his hand to us to follow him, pointing courteously to chairs as we did so, and immediately commenced the perusal of the document. Too much excited to sit down, we stood on either side of him, both reading the face invested with such awful attributes of authority, the power of life and death, as if from its lineaments and expression we could gather the doom before us.     *   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE,       141 It was an open, stern, handsome face,- as one might wish to see, looking far younger than it was, as I knew later; not of the highest order of intellectual refinement, but benevolent, intelligent, and true. The figure that upheld that manly head was tall, ro- bust, and commanding, with something of the military mold about it, revealing, far more than the countenance above, a deter- mined and even inflexible character. As he read on, the beaming, candid expression he had worn in the beginning became clouded, his brows contracted, his lips quivered with emotion of some sort --pity, I trusted it might be-and a dark red flush came to his sunburnt cheek, the muscles of which twitched nervously. Strange contradiction of feeling i--as I saw his agitation increase, mine diminished. We were approaching more nearly to the same level, and I began to feel a power within me, unsuspected until then, to cope and contend with a strong nature even to the bitter end. I drew my long habit back from  my feet, so as to lie like a train behind me, and leave my steps unembarrassed. I swept back my hair, I clenched my riding-whip with both hands across my knees; the outer movements corresponded with the internal resolution, and I felt nerved as with steel to die in the struggle, if needs were, rather than yield the point dearer than life itself. Resolution how impotent, when power and prejudice were its opponents I When he had finished reading the petition, the governor turned. to Jasper, now standingptale and steadily before him. '"Are you Jasper Quintilian?" he asked. He was answered by a bend of the head. "Are you aware," he continued, in cold, constrained accents, "that a paper like this was once before presented for my signature --offered, and rejected?" Agate the silent bow was the only reply.   "2  .

He turned to me almost fiercely7-men like him can so ill bear the suggestions of women.

"Much cause have you to pray for the life of him who tore mother and child apart, and exiled 'ou and yours I How can this be accounted for? It is infatuation-it is misjudged devotion, weakness, or worse."  I saw the change in Jasper's face at these words, and, laying my hand on his arm, I grasped it tightly; then stepping between the two excited men, I spoke a few sentences in subdued accents, faltering between each in the agony of my suppressed emotion. "I came not here to reason, Governor Staunton-affection and ties of blood are things beyond human understanding-nor yet to venture upon equal ground with you. tours is the power--we are mere suppliants. Yet, in old times, there was a sanctity at- tached to that attitude, which protected"  I could not pro- ceed, but stood silent and panting before him.

This is a last necessity with me." "A stringent one, indeed," he said, gravely. "Under these peculiar circumstances, your friends should not have sent you here to give, and receive, so much inevitable pain."' "You do not mean, I whispered, "oh, you cannot mean "--and' losing sight of all ceremonyin the strong excitement of the moment, I laid my gloved hand on his arm, and looked anxiously into his face, speaking now with vehemence-" that you would refuse me, Us, all, that love him, the remnant-the bare, worn remnant-of my grand- father's most miserable life!

I have lately been recalling all the features of this case. They are very revolting; you probably do not know the extent of turpitude involved in the crime in question."  "I do not wish to know more than I do know," I said passion- ately.

When I return, j let me find you more composed"  He turned suddenly away, and left the room. For a few mo- ments we were quite alone. Jasper sat by me, holding my icy   i hands, and bending on my face his tender eyes, full of compas- sionate solicitude. I trembled violently. I felt that I was ill. Black attendants came in bearing salvers of cake, and fruit, and wine (Governor Staunton still adhered to the remnant of slavery in the land), and, urged, with the familiarity born of kindness, that can never be eradicated from, this race, these refreshments on our appetites. Jasper held a bunch of grapes before me. I waved it away, a glass of water was all my burning throat could receive. The servants moved gently through the room as though in the presence t    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEKhIE.       I45 of sickness, placed the chairs in order, brushed the hearth, ad- justed the crimson curtains so as to shut out the brilliant winter- sun, and softly retired. There was something soothing to my ex-s cited nerves in this gentle ministry. I leaned back in the great cushioned chair I occupied, and from my closed eyes the tears streamed slowly, yet gratefully, affording me infinite relief. The warmth of the fire was soothing to my chilled frame, its rigidity seemed to relax as I basked in the cheerful-blaze. I was con- scious of little more until I awoke from a profound refreshing slumber. A low but distinct voice was speaking near me when I aroused from sleep, as if in continuance of a narrative. Its mur- muring sound had already mingled with my sleeping thoughts like falling water. I found it now to be the voice of Governor Staunton. "I passed him on the bridge," he said, " between Moorfields and Grosvenor. The night had been cloudy in the commence- ment, but suddenly, as if God's providence were in this revelation, the moon emerged from behind a mass of clouds, as a face that suddenly looks out from parted curtains, and in its clear flood of light, Erastus Bouverie, on his fleet black horse, dashed by me. He did not see me I am sure, for I was on foot and walking near the handrail in the -shadow, but he passed so close to me, that I felt the breath of his fiery horse ' Sahib in my face. He had ridden far and fast I could see plainly by the fatigued expression  of his own face, revealed in the ghastly moonlight. His eyes were fixed in the direction of Bouverie, his upper lip was drawn back, and his white teeth were bare and set thgether, gleaming , like steel. I could hear his tight, hard breathing. '-He is going home sooner than he said he would do.   How characteristic',' of the man,' I thought. ' I hope he may not follow COanilla VOL.

Some almost prophetic misgivings crept through my mind; but, alas I how little I looked forward to the terrible revelation of j the next day, when the river gave up its dead, and the mangled form of Frederick Staunton, cut literally to pieces, was brought to Grosvenor. I can never forget its horrors." ' There was a pause. Jasper was writing on his tablets. The   j governor was reading his reply.                  "This is true. 'He did prove an alibi, by suborned witnesses, j I am convinced, and the grand jury did dismiss the matter in a summary way, that reflected discredit on me at the time. I was' accused of malignity and ill will toward an unoffending man, .who g had returned from a distant journey some days after the murder, X and was perfectly innocent of its details, and my political pros- ! pects were nearly blighted at the time. I lived this down, I bore  it with what patience I could command, silently, bitterly, yet not revengefully, since I did not take the life of a villain who passed ! almost daily before my eyes.

I was rock to his entreaties,  in which his martyred wife and your injured uncle did not then:  unite. Great names were appended to that petition; I laughed them to scorn. What were they in comparison with the passion that possessed me? I promised myself joy at seeing him on the scaffold, and would have shared his punishment, I believe, rather-    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEIIE.       147 than have commuted it. 'I thanked my God that by my refusal I was permitted to vindicate his violated laws. On my knees I thanked him. :Such were my feelings to Erastus Bouverie on that occasion, feelings so natural that -no man can blame me for entertaining them ; has anything occurred to change them now? You know the wretched farce, or perhaps you do not, that was played ; the simulated death, the demand for his body by his wife, unconscious of the fraud that his servant and he had practised through his wonderful knowledge of the power of certain drugs ; the mock burial, the marble tombstone, each and all characteristic of the man himself. All this has come to light recently. I do not blame Mrs. Bouverie. She has acted nobly. I respect Dr. Quintilian's motives, yours, his grand-daughter's; but toward him, my heart is stone, and my brother's blood cries on me from the ground." I rose and stood before them. I had thrown my riding-hat on the floor by my chair, when I reclined'in it first; my long plaited hair lay over my shoulders in distinct masses, my cheeks I felt were burning. I know that I must have presented a very strange and even wild appearance ; but I did not think of this then, nor until long afterward. "Governor Staunton," I said ; "I have heard what you have been saying. Your sorrow, your wrong through my unhappy grandfather have been grievous enough, God knows ; but it is not for this we are petitioning pardon. We ask you to forego the sentence passed by Judge Wardlaw, on him ten years ago, whereby he was condemned to die for the murder of Dr. Quin. tilian. It is for that offence we ask you to pardon him." "I understand my duty well enough, I hope, Miss de Courcy, to assure you that it does not transcend this point I Yet, feel   "8      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUV YRIE.& ings natural to man will arise in this case to strengthen the claims of justice, and nerve me to fulfill its mandates. This man's life was forfeited to the laws of his country, not to any private vengeance of mine. It remains so. There is no more to be said." j  "No more?"I repeated, with irrepressible indignation. "Ohl i much more ; but I am not the one to say it I I told you, Jas- per," I moaned, in low quivering accents, throwing myself on his arm, and burying my head in his breast ; " that we should fail I I felt that feeble creatures like ourselves could do nothing in the face of authority and armed law. Oh, years of suffering I pain, gj prayer, sorrow, regret, remorse, despair, do you all go for no-, thing? Is there no mercy for offending man, save with his God, beyond the grave?"  A low groan escaped Jasper's lips, the first distinct sound I had ! ever heard them emit. My God, how it thrilled me! I looked up. "Oh, man of power!"I said, "the voice of heaven is speaking to l you now I Even those dumb lips are touched to utter groans in  the great cause of humanity. I make to you one more appeal-- for his sake, hear me," and I pointed to Jasper.

I think, -Governor Staunton, if I am not greatly deceived in you," I said, speaking more calmly; "that bitterly as you have suffered at his hands, you would have prded my grandfather could you have seen him as we saw him a few nights ago, returning sick, exhausted to his household, after lying concealed in a cave during almost the whole of our stormy November, on a bed of leaves made by his own hands, and saved by Providence alone, through the accidental entrance, as it seemed to him, of a poor idiot. I think your noble heart would have melted could you have beheld him, worn to skeleton lean- ness, creeping feebly, humbly, like a beggar into his own house, where he scarcely dared hope for a welcome, and asking only what you would not deny to your meanest, most offending slave- the privilege to die in his bed, surrounded by his family. You will grant him this blessing, will you not, Governor Staunton? He is a dying man; you will suffer him to pass away in peace into the hands of his Maker? You are not revengeful, not relent- less; surely, you will not refuse this boon, in the plenitude of your power?" I paused for his reply. 'I waited in vain; he made me none, and again I burst forth. "Oh, speak I your silence kills me I Tell me that I have not presumed too far in entreating thus your merciful forbearance. Say you will cancel his offences, and write your name on our grateful hearts next to that of Go(d himself!" I knelt before him, I bathed his powerful hands with scalding tears. Again, in the impatience of my agony, and the sore continuance of his silence, I sent forth the bitter cry of extremity, still kneeling at his feet .  "Speak to me, if only one word; but let that word be-    150      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. pardon!P and* I buried my face against his knees, and clasped them wildly. He did not speak to me--he could not. Jasper told me after- ward that he had never seen a man more affected; but, suddenly raising me to a seat, he passed from the room abruptly. Had he t carried the petition with him? I dared not ask! s There have been weeks to me more fieet than the brief moments i of his absence.

I rose to receive it, I trem- : bled, I grasped at the nearest chair. The room seemed to reel .7 around me, the carpet rose in waves, and the roar of waters  : was on my ear. I had overtasked my strength, it forsook me,  ^ and I fell forward fainting at Governor Staunton's feet, still hold- ing to, my heart the paper I could not read, but which I knew  . contained my grandfather's pardon.

The fever that the tumult of the last week had stirred in my blood, laid violent hands upon me now, and for ten days I did not lift my head from its pillow. I was cared for in Governor Staunton's family, like one of them ; and Dr. Quintil, wisest of leeches, kindest of nurses, kept constant watch by my side. He never considered me in immediate danger, which alone would have brought my grandmother from her habitual seclusion, and her ill husband; yet it was nearly three weeks before I felt strong enough to set forth on my homeward way. My very anxiety to do this, interfered with my ability to undertake the journey, I have no doubt, since every wish, dream, and thought of my being pointed to Bouverie, and prevented that repose of mind most conducive to speedy recovery. Jasper came and went repeatedly, during this interval, detailing to me faith- fully, as far as it was judicious to do so, the condition of things at home, and bringing me messages of love from my grand- parents.  Mr. Clavering, too, came more than once during my conva- lescence, and was received, on the last occasion of his calling, a few days before I left Bellevue. He remained some hours, and confirmed the delightful impression he had made at first; and yet, there was nothing in his manner then, to prepare me for what followed so soon afterward. . When at last the hour came for my departure, there was a tender leave-taking between their guest and the whole family, from the governor's wife and daughters down to *   *                    - ;,- y   152      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERE.             the sable attendants, who had done so much to alleviate her suf- ferings. Gold could not pay for such kindness as these domestics had lavished upon me, though Dr. Quintil spared not this on the  occasion of my recovery, so important to him, he thought, and all  that loved me. Wrapped in shawls and furs, I was placed by the . governor's own hands-for he would have it thus-in his comfort-  able family carriage, and drawn swiftly home by his four stout  horses. The twenty miles were accomplished in a few hours. "Rouse, Lilian," said Dr. Quintil-for with the languor still  clinging around me of recent sickness, I dozed nearly all the dis-  tance-' and look your best. We are approaching Botiverie." I sat up, and, for one moment, I was a child again, so vividly did that hour return to my recollection, when he brought me home first, and spoke to me in nearly the same words; and now, as then,  the branches swept across the carriage with their harsh, repulsive grating, though clothed with autumn foliage before, and bare and  desolate now. But the very opposite to this contrast had  occurred in my own being. The blank misery of my childish deso-  lation had been replaced by blessings unspeakable, and the vivid-  ness with which, for a moment, the past returned to me, and the joy with which I put it aside, proved, by the bleak anguish it occasioned me, the infinite superiority of my present lot. Thank God! we are at home again!"I. murmured, as the carriage paused before the door, where fond arms were open to  receive me, and words, and smiles, and tears, vied in endearment  of welcome.  "My Lilian has been ill Il my grandmother said; "more ill than they told me. I see from her changed face and shrunken form.'                   ^  "Never mind that, now, dear grandmother ; how is he T"y   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERI,        153 "Oh, better, Lilian, better I yet, to the outward eye alone, much worse I Worn to a shadow, passing tranquilly away, at peace with God and man-a lowly Christian at last, for he has received baptism, and even the extreme unction. All worldly schemes and visions laid at rest. You will find him thus, Lilian. " We went in together, after I had laid aside my wrappings, and smoothed my hair, so that I might noti seem unfamiliar to his eyes. He was lying on his couch, placed at right angles with the fire, facing the great bow-window in her chamber, which my grandmother's thoughtful hand had lined with blooming plants, in vivid contrast with the desolation without. He seemed to be gazing, wrapped in thought, perhaps, through the transparent  - panes, on the desolate face of nature spread before his view, dearer to his long imprisoned eye than all the beauty of artificial bloom. His face was averted, as we entered; but, hearing our steps, he turned. I was not prepared for such a startling change. I had not thought that one always so thin could be so much thinner.    God forgive me, if the idea of a "weir wolf" suggested itself to me as I beheld him. And there lay my broken idol I "Oh, grandfather l"I murmured, kneeling beside him, and smothering my cries in the bed-clothes, yet sobbing convulsively. I felt his hand patting my head feebly for some time before he spoke. "Don't, darling I don't P" he said at last. "Be patient, your trouble will soon be over. Don't make me cough, Lilian." L I was calm in a moment, as I have once before said, as by an . impulse of self-command, and looking up, I tried to smile on him,  through my bitter, blinding tears a "It was hardly worth the effort, Lilian , the ride, and the * scene, and the sickness, to save Ouch a poor effigy of life as  * *"'"   154      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. remains to me. Yet it was well meant, and nobly done, and I thank you."  I kissed his emaciated hands, his skeleton forehead, for all answer, and passing my hand through his still beautiful waving hair, profuse as that of a boy, gazed at him steadfastly, mourn- fully. He was indeed passing away. The comparison of the sword wearing through the sheath, suited the peculiarity of his  decay. The glimmer of the steel might almost be imagined in that brilliant, dying face. His eyes, once small in comparison with his other features, now rolled in their sunken sockets, like  : great glittering globes of 'quicksilver covered with a glaze of  black glass ; his magnificent teeth stood out in skeleton fierce- ness, the tight lips scarcely covering them, and the skin seemed growing literally to his cheek-bones and temples; the last pil- :1 lared and ridged like those of a grand old statue. "Oh, what a man was here in the beginning," I thought. What process of  mind, of education, or of circumstance had power to warp this majestic creature from his native integrity? Has he been, like . Job, a mere sport of evil spirits, an experiment in the hands of i J his Maker? Oh, no, no   I will not dream'such things even I I dare not, it is blasphemous. I am groping in the shadow at best, and fate is above all comprehension.  His was a dark, 'dark destiny I1" With thoughts like these at work in my bosom, I rose and left him for a time, until rest and refreshment should prepare me more fully to assist those around me in the arduous task of watch- , ing him night and day, as they were obliged to do toward the last. As the strength of others declined, and mine returned, he be- came my almost nightly charge. He slept so ill that he' enjoyed my society more during the night watch than any other time.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEIS.        155 He used to remark that my voice refreshed him, like the sound of falling water. "It is so clear, so sweet, so life-giving," he would say, "in comparison with those disciplined tones that tell of hard world service, and practised restraint." "Thank God, Lilianl'" he observed to me one night, " if only for the glorious gift of impulse you possess. When it belongs to a vigorous nature like yours, no better steed could be found to bear one over the rough places of life, but like the flying horse of the  Indian in Arabian story, it takes a strong h ad to govern and to guide." "Woe then for the weakly impulsive, grandfather," I said;, "better coldness and caution forever. It is at best a dangerous gift." "I have never been impulsive,", he said. "I know not the joy, the triumph of the sensation. All that J have done wrong, as    t men esteem these things, has been done deliberately, and has never been regretted."                         :i - "Oh, grandfather, I am grieved to hear this from your lips. I never believed it before." "You do not make the proper distinction, child. In looking - : back over my life, I can see where I have erred: it must be so,  : since others have suffered by my acts. Yet I think I would do    the same thing again with the same motives at work, and do     I them with the same deliberation, and having so done them, re- morse becomes hypocrisy. It is only the impulsive who can atone , : by penitence for their ill deeds ; cool offenders are shut out by ,! the nature of things from any such resource." -  "Oh, grandfather, all is forgiven now I You have clasped the. holy cross, you are a Christian!"  He did not answer for some time ; at last he said: . j':q -,!   "6      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOWUVERIE. "I am glad you. mentioned the word ' cross,' Lilian. I would speak to youof yours. I have done worse things that have cost me fewer pangs than the crushing of your little cross." "Never mind that now, grandfather; it occasions me no longer a regret, a thought even. Be at peace." "That was a failure like the rest, Lilian. I will not die de- ceiving you." (Alas, I had known it ever since the conversation with my grandmother about the ring and the gnome eye jewel.) "But I have kept this splendid gem for you, not so much to repay you for the loss of your diamonds, as to prove my affection for you. It is the jewel I have most valued of all I have ever pos- sessed ; a great monarch placed it on my hand, a bold, bad man, like myself, Lilian, but shielded away from human censure by almost superhuman power,?' and he drew from his bosom and opened the small mother of pearl box containing the magnificent jewel, now restored to its setting. "Take it, my love," he said, "and keep it for my sake." I' received it mutely. "It is all I have to bequeath to you, Lilian," he. added. "My estate, whatever it is, has long been testated to your grandmother during her life. I made my will in a prison of  l Russia, and will not change it now that devotion and self-sacrifice on her part have more than ever entitled her to enjoy its provisions ;  but all will be yours some day--yours and Jasper's," he almost gasped. The compromise cost him dear; how bitter were his  prejudices. "They have told me all," he added, gloomily. "I bore the announcement calmly-necessity knows no, law-yet it was the last -bitter drop that made my cup run over. Poetical justice, sentimental people would call such a union-eh, Lilian IP he said, with that sudden levity habitual to him, and with hisa bright, sarcastic smile. "I call it," he began--" bar "   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       - 1 57 "Grandfather!"   I laid my deprecating hand on his, and checked the expression he was about to utter. "We will waive this subject, if you please," I said gravely, " at least until. you can consider it more complacently." "Forever then," he replied with a slight impatient gesture, nor was it ever resumed between us. "And now, Lilian, will you. read me from the Bible?" "What portion, grandfather?"I asked eagerly, thrilled as I was by the unusual nature of the request. "Which of the books. of the Apostles shall I choose?" "Neither," he said.  They do not stir me, Lilian. Read to me from the Book of Job, the grand lamentations of the man whose clue of fate was given into Satan's hand; or read me the solemn charge of Jacob to his sons, and let me interpret my  : own nature therefrom; or read me David's death scene, and his last words to Solomon, when the hoarded hate of a whole life burst forth and asserted wronged human nature, triumphant to the last, over all the mummery of priesthood. I should have    ; lived in those days, Lilian! Men acted out their natures then, and power was called munificence, and will inspiration. David was a man after God's own heart, .yet how have I been worse than David?   Only unsuccessful, Lilian--a reproach hi itself i"                         ' "Oh, grandfather, different conduct is demanded now. Christ's teachings"  -  I commenced. "Lilian, the heart of man is unchanged by time; it beats now as in the days of Jacob, attuned to the self-same chords of love, hatred, self-interest, that ruled it then. These new precepts are only skin deep, they improve the surface of society only ; the old sores fester within."                '  ,  :  :   158      THE HOUSEHOLD OF. BOUTVERIE. There was no use of reasoning with him, his sophistry had so  l completely taken possession of his being that its subtle poison i had penetrated to the very sources of thought itself; but I re- fleeted how directly opposed to all he was saying, and deluding himself to believe, had been the conduct of his own household of 1 Bouverie. One need to have gone no further to have proved the beauty and the truth of Christian law, comprised in the few words, love, duty, and forbearance, for self-sacrifice is only the result, the aggregate of these three, and includes forgive- I ness.  "You are not going to read to me, Lilian?" he went on to say, after waiting a moment for me to begin.          1 "Yes indeed, grandfather, gladly, whenever you make your selection. What shall it be?. Perhaps you will listen to one of the Psalms, grandfather?"I asked, almost afraid that : -he would refuse me. I understood from a motion of his hand that I might proceed.  I read to him first the fifty-second  Psalm, and afterward, encouraged by his silence, the one hun- dred and second Psalm, as those which, as well as I could remember, best suited his condition. He was profoundly touched. He groaned aloud when I read the verse in the first, "Deliver -me from blood guiltiness, O my God, thou God of my salvation, and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy  righteousness ;" and when, a little further on, I came to the pas- sage, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a  contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise." He covered his face suddenly with his hands, and -shook convulsively. When I i had finished reading the second Psalm, he repeated after me a few sentences that had touched him, as if unconsciously. He had oerhaps committed them in childhood, for I can scarcely think one '. , ' .    ' " - " , lJ   THE .HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. 19 hearing would have impressed his ear so accurately. They were these:     - "' iMy heart is smitten and withered like grass, so that Iforget to eat my bread. "'By reason of my groaning, my bones cleave to my skin. "'Mine enemies reproach me all the day, and they that are mad against me are sworn against me. "'For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping. "' Because of thy indignation and thy wrath, for thou hast lifted me up and cast me down.          , "' My days are like a shadow that., declineth, and I am withered like grass.'" Or perhaps in his great solitude my grandfather had made that marvellous mirror of the heart of man his study, and found in the masterpiece of antiquity, with all its horrors and magnificent rhapsodies, companionship more suitable to his nature than in the teachings of the meek and perfect Jesus. Be it as it may, he seemed to revel in the grand imagery and terse eloquence of the inspired Jewish writers, and to feel himself at home with those sentiments from which Christians naturally recoil. I began to think Bishop Clare was right, and that for some natures, at least, the Bible was dangerous food.  The ancient Bible I mean only. No one could mistake the teachings of. Christ, too simple to need a creed, or require an interpreter. Let every man read for himself, and seek assistance, not guidance, in the light of others, according to his best necessities- So shall the world be purified and made Fit for the glory of the latter days."    -160     THE HOUSEHOLD' OF BOUVEmu a During another night-watch, when the subject nearest the hearts of all that loved or cared for him was again introduced, I ventured to offer him my heartfelt congratulations on the pros- pect of eternal happiness before him. "Eternal happiness!" he repeated, "why not eternal despair as well, Lilian? Facts are indestructible, philosophers say, and if I deserved God's punishment once, I deserve it still. But fortunately for my peace of mind, I have long known that     there is but one thing eternal in God's universe, and that is   change. Mutability is the sole permanence."            "Oh, grandfather, this is self-mockery, and you cannot, must not  believe so darkly. I was so happy in the belief that you were   a Catholic, and open to the conviction of a death-bed repentance." "Have I not told you, that it lay not in me to repent; what  more remains? Yet above all human institutions of the sort, I  respect that church, and it was due to others, to Camilla, to Bishop Clare, to my ancestry even, to avow my allegiance to its s magnificence, its antiquity, its merciful tenets, so superior to all other Christian teachings." He paused for a reply. I made none. He continued: "You are disappointed. I am sorry. Yet I will not deceive   you, Lilian ; ' deep calls unto deep,' you know, and 'blood answers unto true blood.' Let others enjoy the happiness of delusion in my case, if happiness it -be. You must know the truth, come weal come woe. Yet be discreet; let no one suffer through these revelations. I have done my best to satisfy all around me as far as externals go. For the inner man I am accountable and respon- sible to God alone."                      I "Such an accountability, grandfather "I groaned rather than  uttered. "Such a dreadful responsibility I Oh, trust in Jesus, X   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        16i the mediator, the comforter, the atoner, by whose precious blood alone your sins can be washed away!" "I am sorry I cannot accept this faith," he said earnestly. "It is beautiful, but impossible. Belief cannot be compelled. I am not to blame, therefore, even in the eyes of Divinity, if I remain incredulous. The perfect Christ will pity and forgive me, if wrong ; and for the rest, God knows I have suffered enough, nor have I wearied any ear, not even his, with my complaints. If there is anything further to be endured, I shall count my. self persecuted, and take satisfaction in the thought.  God is just, I hope, and justice is all I ask. A quiet sleep with no awakening. It is a reasonable request. He will grant it, Lilian, or we have mistaken his nature." "And your immortal soul, grandfather? Think you that can sleep forever?" He smiled his brilliant, Voltaire smile, mocking and shimmer- ing as sheet lightning. "ife is the soul;" he said. "When that is extinct, all is over. Blow out the candle, whither goes the flame?"  "Oh, grandfather, you seal our eternal separation by such words. If your doctrine were true, how dark, how terrible would our parting seem to me. But no, thank heaven, mere belief can mold no law of life or death, and I will wrestle for you against this terrible conviction, with prayer and faith, as Jacob wrestled all night in his tent with the unseen enemy, and rose exhausted, yet victorious at the last."                ? "Lilian, this is vain. I have lived my life; it has been a failure, and life-worshipper as I am, and have been, I would not undertake it again if I could, even in this delightful world.

I Yet again I read to him, and at his own request, portions of   those beautiful Psalms, in hearing which he seemed now to place his chief comfort; nmalking me repeat almost daily that which appeared his favorite, beginning-" Save me, O Lord, for the  - waters have come in unto my soul."  I have heard him, with ineffable pity, murmuring portions of   this Psalm in his broken slumber:  ' Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.                             . "Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor. My i adversaries are all before thee. "Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness." These are some passages that I remember to have gathered   -  from his sleeping lips.                     ! But if these grand and sorrowful lamentations escaped him    i during periods of unconsciousness, not less did his slumbers reveal ? the unquiet nature of his ever recurring thoughts to those strange visions which had once blindly possessed him. I believe that my grandmother, from the very exhaustion of her nervous condition, was spared the suffering of hearing or understanding those muttered words, which revealed so much that he disavowed when conscious and awake. With his elixir of gold, an exciting remedy, which the physicians sternly forbade, provoking hemorrhage, as it now invariably did, he seemed to have put away all his mad dreams of alchemy, and schemes of unbounded fortune. But his sleeping lips murmured a different story.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        163 "We shall yet succeed, Fabius," he would mutter; "build the fires, we are losing time." Again. "Boiling gold I It is a glorious sight. The sun was made this way. Light was an afterthought." "Old man," he said one day, "this is our last throw for fortune. We must compel them    into one. More pressure, Fabius. You are timid, let me have the handle. My God I all is lost I "Diamonds I frigid fire you mean," he whispered, "how glo- rious they are I the souls of the mineral kingdom. Ah, give me my gnome eye, there is luck in that ! Napoleon lost it at Moscow, they say. Alexander found it. Fortune changed mas- ters there-that was all. Fate is chance." It was merciful to rouse him at such times, he seemed to suffer so, to strain every nerve, every muscle, and- to- speak with such difficulty. Violent fits of coughing usually succeeded these som- nambulic phases ; and in one of these, surrounded by his house- hold, impotent to aid him, yet suffering with him every convulsive throb, and lying in the arms of his weeping wife, whose embrace could with difficulty restrain him in his fierce agony, he suddenly, expired. We could scarcely realize death in the swiftness of his doom. An hour before he had been laughing, jesting even, in his peculiar way, had taken food, then slept, muttered in his sleep, roused up coughing, and stepped at once into the awful Presence. He lay pale, rigid, masterful even in death; foam ton his pale lips, tinged with blood, constantly exuding, constantly wiped away by her whose blood it was, during the long, dull day, the creeping, mournful night that interposed between him and the grave. -.   164      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIEo We laid him at the foot of that marble monument, erected years before over his seeming grave, and on which his name alone was written; to which my grandmother caused to be added, the simple word, "INFELIX?.

IT was toward the end of the month of September, twelve years after the death of the master, that a plain but handsome carriage was seen to drive through the grounds of Bouverie, and stop at the front door of the mansion, under the shadow of those spreading Norway firs, that grew to the. height of more than thirty feet, before the portico. An aged but still stately man, white-haired, eagle-eyed, and of true soldierly bearing, descended first from the vehicle, and extended an assisting hand, his only one, for the coat-sleeve of the left arm hung loosely by his side, to the youthful looking lady, and the two fair children who followed her. A liveried servant who sat on the box beside the coachman, had, in the meantime, after opening the coach-door, ascended the steps, and rung two or three brisk peals on the hall-bell. The  : summons was answered, a little tardily, by a demure-looking, dark-eyed woman, past middle age;  brown of face, slight in ' form, and neatly dressed, in a close-fitting cap of snowy white- - ness, and a nun-like dress of black-whose prim features relaxed- into a pleased smile, as she thought she recognized in the guests, now standing on the marble platform by the door-those who  had been for some days past hourly expected at Bouverie. "Come in, Colonel de Courcy and Lady Edith,' she said, with  - the somewhat familiar politeness of a privileged domestic. "For :-. ,    168      THE HOUSEHOLD, OF BOUVtIEIE. such, I think, I can venture to call your names. Mrs. Quintilian has been looking for you for three days past, at every arrival of the train, and this is the first time she has been out of the place when the carriage came back from the depot. But that is always the way when friends are coming; we look, and look for them, and, after all, they frequently take us quite unawares. "Walk in, if you please," she continued, throwing wide open the leaves of the door of the drawing-room. "The mistress just stepped out to see about Patrick McCormick's sick child (our gardener, he is, Lady Edith). It won't be many minutes before she hears of your arrival. In the meantime, I will go and make arrangements for baths and refreshments, for you must be tired and dusty, Lady Edith-and the poor dears I hungry, no doubt!" and she bustled away, somewhat to the relief of the newly-arrived guests, accustomed to English quiet on the part of servants-and of course, wholly unconscious of Bianca's true position in the household of Bouverie. Mrs. Quintilian was not quite so readily found, as Bianca had sup- posed she would be. After leaving the bedside of the sick child, having first coaxed him into taking his medicine (refused until then with an obstinate pertinacity, worthy of his paternity), she had wandered into the oak forest, hard by Patrick's cottage, and musing there, amid the falling leaves, she had lost sight of the hour, which might bring her guests to Bouverie. Full thirty minutes elapsed between the disappearance of Bianca, and the advent of " the mistress,"--an interval employed by the restless boys in close but respectful observation of the miniature statues, shells and vases, of a rosewood etagere-one of the few  modern innovations visible in the. drawing-room  of Bouverie.   TIiE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       169 But the elder guests were attracted by the pictures that lined the walls, many of which were from the hand of Jasper Quin- tilian. To the portraits already referred to in the past narrative two only had been added. One, fine full-length of Bishop Clare, in his pontifical robes, another the beautiful and spiritual head of Jasper Quintilian himself. But these were the work of another artist. Colonel de Courcy, who wag a judge of art, was perfectly spell-bound before the picture of "Aurora Awakening," one of those already alluded to by Lilian de Courcy, as the companion of the "Dying Flora." The scene represented was in a cavern, supported by irregular columns of stalactite formation, through a ragged and remote rent in the roof of which you see the morning star, relieved by a crimson streak of dawn beyond.  Aurora is'in the act of rising on one arm, from the mossy bed on which she has been reposing, sleeping attendants recline around her in various attitudes, and one very beautiful figure. sits with folded wings and cheek drooped  on her elevated knees, around which her hands are lightly clasped, leaning against a column. The expression conveyed is one of profound repose, an extin- guished torch lies beside her. The face of the goddess wears that exquisite freshness and glad surprise that we see only in the-faces of children or the very young, when sleep first forsakes them. The large dewy eyes seem  to have been startled from slumber, and look out with a shy, and fawn-like wildness on the gazer. The crimson lips are parted with a faint smile, revealing the white line within in the merest glimpse of radiance. The hair falls in soft shining curls of golden brown about, the throat and bosom, which one slender hand is employed in veiling with fleecy drapery. VOL. II.-8   170     THE HOUSEHOLD Or BOUVEWIE. A sculptured foot rests lightly on the floor, and part of the beau- tifully rounded limb above it is visible. The other seems with: drawn among the draperies of the couch. About the whole figure breathes out a faint, roseate mist, through which objects beyond are distinctly, yet dimly revealed. Beside the couch stands Hesperus (or Phosphor?) with a lighted torch. This exquisite shape conveys an idea of eager impulse im- possible to describe. A lark flutters at his feet. There are other accessories, but these are the distinctive features of the painting. While Colonel de Courcy contemplated this picture with un- feigned delight, Lady Edith Sinclair stood wrapt beneath the portrait of Mrs. Bouverie, painted in her youth, by a native artist, who knew better than any other how to idealize and per- petuate beauty. "How beautiful and spirited is this head, dear uncle I1" she remarked. "Could it have been that of Mrs. Bouverie, of whose beauty we have heard so much? Do leave the ideal, and come and look at the actual with me ; no picture charms me like a good portrait, after all, with its striking individuality." He obeyed her summons and echoed her admiration; then turning away, observed-- "I wish that heavy black curtain were lifted, that hides from view the picture above the mantel-piece. I have my suspicions that it would reveal to us that mysterious personage, or his semblance rather, whose story (heard only so far by snatches) has moved us so strongly." At this moment the door opened, and admitted a gentleman of apparently about fifty years of age, with whose appearance we are already familiar, and the. strangers were recalled at once from all surroundings to concentrate their attention on their courteous host. , \          THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEIE.        17 Dr. Quintilian had scarcely dropped their cordially shaken hands, when he was followed by the mistress of Bouverie, who had stopped a moment in the hall to throw off her bonnet, and came in with the flush of exercise still glowing on her cheek. Behind her appeared Bianca, armed with a basket of Sickle pears, which she exhibited to the longing eyes of the youthful Sinclairs, and with such temptations in view, and the additional charm of her own " nods and becks and wreathed smiles," she managed to draw them quietly and unobserved, from their alle- giance to the etagere, and consign them over to the safe keeping of "Danvers," the English groom   (their volunteer nurse pro tem.) now taking a cold cut in the pantry. Thus attention from each other was not diverted on the part of the principals of that first interview by any other presenc- an interview long desired, and not without its own peculiar causes of emotion. Pass we over this meeting, for which all had been prepared by expressions  of mutual good-will and renewed understanding Let us rather record the impressions there received by each mind important as these ever prove to be, in the long run of friend ship and  even slight acquaintanceship, and sure as we are to return to them  at last, even should they be  temporarily effaced or suspended. Mrs. Quintilian was struck by the attractive, frank, yet scarcely beautiful face of Lady Edith, in which she beheld reflected that of the lover of her youth, and was at once prepared to accord -her a place in her affections. But in Colonel de Courcy she saw even more to interest and win her warm regard. In his worn face and lofty distinguished figure-in the glance of his eye, the bend of his head, the curl   172'.     THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.- of his lip--she discerned the soldier and the gentleman. In every feature might be traced the struggle of a lifetime ; and the sound of his manly, and true, yet disciplined, and-,deferential voice, revealed another phase in his character-its chivalry and ten- dency, its sincerity and sentiment. Was he not, too, her only remaining kinsman-close, however distant-because none came between them?  And that empty sleeve! was there not pathos in every flutter of that useless appendage that spoke to her woman's heart louder than words? Colonel de Courcy grew into her feelings at once, almost as a part of self, and he in turn surveyed her from the, first with an admiring respect he had seldom felt for woman before. The guests of Mrs. Quintilian were simultaneously struck with the power and beauty of her presence ; yet they could scarcely have analyzed this sensation, had they attempted to do so. Both had seen women far more beautiful, as the word goes, who exercised no such impressive influence over them, even at the first meeting; an influence that in this instance deepened hour by hour, and bound them to her as closely in that visit of a fortnight as if they had known her casually for years. Colonel de Courcy had been prepared by his knowledge of her life and its motives-never attained until after the death of Mr. Bouverie-and by the letters she had written to him in answer to those in which he covered himself with reproaches (as a proud nature is pleased to do when acknowledging its injustice to another, for a component part of true pride is reparation), to see a noble and remarkable woman, an " esprit fort" perhaps ; but not ex- actly such a woman as he met, when he came to Bouverie-fe- minine, sensitive, tender to her very finger-tps. It is only when we stand face to face with our fellow-beings that we estimate   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEkIE.       173 them truly, feelingly. Whatever prestige existed before, goes for nothing in the clear revealing light of ocular demonstration, or stands for what it is worth only thenceforth. Col. de Courcy was a fastidious man in some things. He exacted refinement in eiery woman, before he could acknowledge beauty. In Mrs. Quintilian he found both, or rather admitted both, per- haps for the sake of the indispensable quality he made his " sine qua non." Yet, perhaps, I do her injustice in denying her either attribute even by insinuation-so, to the analysis I Her figure not above the -middle height, yet justly and nobly proportioned, with that mixture of strength and slenderness that imparts such grace and vitality to movement, was terminated by fine extremities. The face, oval in form, and regular in outline, was of a clear, healthful pallor, seldom relieved by color at the time of which I write, -whatever its early tints might have been. The skin was smooth and finely grained with a slight marble-like gleam across the nose and temples. The mouth, too large perhaps, yet expressive of sweetness as well as melancholy power when in repose, was sus- ceptible of a fine smile, revealing sound but not remarkable teeth, and the lips possessed the peculiarity of, varying in tint according to the character of the excitement that ruled the spirit within. The eyes large, finely cut, nobly placed, were indisputably a beau- tiful feature. They were of that rarest of all colors, a true violet blue, and were shadowed by long fringed lashes of deepest brown, matching the brows above. The hair that crowned her temples was not so dark and had probably in early youth counted more threads of gold than brown, though the deeper tint predominated now. She wore it wrapped closely around her head and plainly across her forehead, yet its inclination to cluster in abundant curls, whenever loosed for a moment, evinced its strength and vitality.   174      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU V ERIE Above her compact yet not lofty brow, the nobly formed and well set head rose like a dome with all its fine developments of veneration, benevolence, conscientiousness, and ideality revealed at a glance-a head too powerful, perhaps, but for its graceful molding, to become a woman's shoulders. Such was the outline of an appearance which, if not beautiful in contrast to the ex- quisite standard presented by Mrs. Bouverie, might still, in the eyes of some, have been even more attractive. The children of a beautiful mother are seldom vain, or even justly appreciated, yet there was, undeniably, about Mrs. Qaintilian's whole presence, something of that strange indefinable charm that had surrounded Erastus Bouverie, almost as with a separate atmosphere, and which constituted her sole physical inheritance from him. Let me not, however, bestow on her that word of dubious meaning, so truly applicable to him, and which seems to me to signify something false and serpent-like in its very derivation. I will not call her "fascinating." Truth was her element, and whatever of power she possessed did, I believe, purely and unconsciously spring from this ruling principle of her life, blending itself as it did with all her more brilliant qualities-courage, generosity, tenderness, imagin: tion; the last indeed a mere "Will o9 the Wisp," without such a foundation. If the expression might be permitted, I would say that there was about her a sort of emotional repose, strangely interesting. Colonel de Courcy had never met with a woman like this before,* scarcely imagined that such existed at -all, out of the pages of fiction (for it is a strange thought to me, that many have-that novelists have created lovelier women than God ever fashioned 1) He wished, for the first time, in years, for his lost youth, and olden powers to please, that he might lay them all before her, who filled every requisition of his being.   THE  HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VERIE.       17 Yet this was she his careless hand had put away forever, when he became master of Taunton Tower, and when sick, disap- pointed, almost broken-hearted, she might have been the solace of his life. I do believe this sexagenarian veteran came very near falling in love about this -time, for the first time in thirty. years, with his newly encountered kinswoman; but of this in- clination, if indeed, it existed, Mrs. Quintilian, fortunately, was  'for the time unconscious. Her pleasure in the society of intelligent men was undis- guised. Yet it might be seen very soon after' forming her ac- quaintance, that a certain limit was assigned to such inter- course, that none might ever pass. It was plainly her inten- tion to walk through life alone, or, in such companionship only as fate had left to her from the wreck of past happiness. Her very dress indicated, by its fixed .charater,- this involuntary resolution. Strange paradoxical words, which yet express my precise meaning. For she had thrown aside widows' weeds, as they are termed--  they were distasteful to her-4cumbrous crapes and bombazines l mean nothing after the firsthand are odious to artistic touch and  scent; but she had assumed none the less the habit of her order, * "The hopeless 1"   ; . Her dress, severely simple, though always of fine materials, was invariably black in color, and relieved only by those falls of fine white lace, which, like her grandmother, she wore at .wrists and throat habitually. An artist, who had, on Colonelde Courcy's arrival, just com- menced a portrait of her-for Dr. Quintilian, suggested the becomingness and propriety of colors, as more suitable her age and style of face, and the success of his picture.   176      THE HOUSEIOLD OF BOUVERiIE. Dr. Quintilian, who had an old bachelor's eye for the pictau resque in dress, and had through life been a close observer, and a nice critic of ladies' toilet and costume, united his entreaties to those of the artist, but ineffectually. She declined, though with evident reluctance, any change in this respect, however temporary, however apparently unimport- ant. Dr. Quintilian seemed disappointed, the artist amazed, and Colonel de Courcy himself was slightly shocked at her obstinacy of resolution, in such a trifling matter. He ventured to expostulate a little when they were alone, and a fitting opportunity was presented. " You American women," he said, "perform a sort of toilet ' suttee,' when you become widows, and bury yourselves in weeds for life. As well the funeral pyre of the Hindoos at once, as such immolation of beauty." " Dress constitutes beauty, then, in your opinion ?" Colonel de Courcy. " Not exactly," he replied, a little puzzled by her manner; " but you must acknowledge it improves beauty amazingly. An unstylish woman in mourning always reminds me of a moth that has fallen in an inkstand, and crept out again terribly draggled." "Then think of Mrs. Pipchin, in her crapes and bombazines," she rejoined, merrily, " sitting grimly opposite little Paul Dombey, with all of her repulsive accompaniments. It is enough to make an imaginative person hate weeds forever." " Then why do you persist in wearing them ?" was his naive inquiry. "I did not suspect you of being so prejudiced, I avow," she replied, much amused. "So you meant the simile of the moth for me, after all. I thank you, humbly thank you I"    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       1" "You are not unstylish," he murmured, a little sheepishy. "Well, yes, I confess," he added, lifting his head again, after a moment's hesitation, "that I was trying to approach the subject of mourning, so as to bring it home to -you by degrees. But my skirmishing was not meant for you; the attack was yet to come. I will be honest, and say what I think,. if you will permit- me without further preamble." "Say on, -but take as your data the truth. I do not wear weeds. I simply wear a uniform common to my class."  "You are coming to Taunton Tower-you have almost pro- mised this, you know. The whole country will pour in to see you, and my vanity, my pride are concerned. I would have you look your best. I would have my kinswoman attired as becomes her rank, her beauty," and so saying, he bowed deferentially, hesitate ing a moment afterward.        ' "Surely," he continued, "after five years of widowhood, a; woman may resume her allegiance to fashion without an objec-} tion, even on the part of the censorious; and sentimentalize, -as people will and do, costume has its effect, a powerful one, in  enhancing loveliness and impressing the beholder." "This is -true in most cases," she replied, "but not in mine. I am better in this garb than in any other. It would shock even; you to see me renounce it. There is so much in the law of corres- pondences. "When nature struck the bloom from my cheek, it was time for me to have done with artificial colors. It was a suggestion from a higher power than fashion. This physical change passed over me suddenly, at the time of my husband's death. I was rosy then ; I am seldom other than pale now. Besides, let me ask you, do you think it would add at all to the vital appearance    178      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. of that dead ash-tree in the park, that you looked at yesterday,  and admired even for its stately stem, were we togarland it with ? green leaves! It would certainly be a bitter and senseless - mockery. And so with me. I scarcely think I shall ever bud again." She laughed slightly as she said these words, but her parted lips grew pale, and she clasped her hands nervously.       l "Yet Dr. Quintilian tells me, that in spite of your determined I retirement, you disclaim the charge of being unhappy. Nay, he adds, that he considers you a model of contentment." -"I hope I am not ungrateful," she rejoined. "I certainly should be this, were I to refuse to drink cheerfully of any cup my Creator has mixed for me."    "Yet you have found it bitter?"  "Never." "You surprise me, Lilian."  "  There is no bitterness in true sorrow. It is the meekest, most submissive thing. It makes the proudest soul so humble   S the rudest nature so tender, that I believe it is the only means to effect that change of heart of which the Bible tells us."  "You have felt this, Lilian '?"  "Partially."  "It seems  to me, in gazing on you, that you are the sole inm  stance I  have met with, of a person who has come to the true X knowledge and possession of 'that peace which passeth all under- standing.'      , "I  cannot claim so exalted a condition of mind, if such it be."  The last words dropped slowly from her lips.          g "Do  you not then consider peace the most desirable of all blessings?" he asked, with something of surprise in his manner.   THEE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       119 "No; happiness is better, and of this peace is but one in- gredient.'" "Can you name the other?" "Joy." He never forgot the expression of her face, as she spoke this word. It thrilled him strangely; and he followed her large blue eyes as they looked out on space, as if to see what image filled them with such ineffable radiance. In another moment, she turned, with her hands still tightly folded, and looked at him again, but the glorious glance was gone. "You are right," he murmured at last, as if holding self-com- munion more than conversation. "Peace is, when we consider it rightly, only a secondary condition of being, negative rather than satisfactory; but I never thought of that before. I am afraid, after all, Lilian," he said, speaking louder, and turning more directly to her, "that you are unhappy, though you will not acknowledge it. Speak to me frankly, my time is short with you, and I would know the truth, for you interest me power- fully."  And extending his single hand, he grasped both of hers, clasped as they were upon her knee, in its long and powerful fingers. "Banish the suspicion, I pray you, then, if indeed my welfare concerns you, and try and think better of me, Colonel de Courcy. Reason about the matter, even if you will," she continued, with- drawing her hands gently from his grasp, and resting her brow on one of them, as she leaned back in the deep chair she occupied, while she fixed her earnest eyes upon his face. "Do you think that an unhappy woman could laugh as I laughed last night at Pat McCormick's more than Irish blunders? Could an unhappy woman enjoy as I do, the culture of flowers, ,  .    .              .   180      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. of poetry, of poultry, and patch-work (a droll alliteration, I am making, truly 1) or love to sing new songs, and read new books, and devour the papers for their news and their politics, illn the fashion that you witness in me daily? Think what a very serious charge it is-a censure even-to be called unhappy I'l She paused a moment, smiling and shaking her head, then' re- summing her serious air, she continued : "Yet, if you really care to hear it, I will tell you how I feel, Colonel de Courcy-and if the illustration I shall give you be homely, accept it at least as heartfelt. ' a I feel like one who has seen the rest of her family go forth in the morning to witness a beautiful pageant-and who stays at home to complete a needful household task-certain that she will follow -them when this is ended, and enjoy with them, after a time, the splendor of the sight. In the meantime it behooves her to set the house in order, and to husband her resources, that she may not meet those she loves with a fretful visage and exhausted energies, with a warped soul even, unfitted for enjoys ment, when she goes forth at evening." "This is mere patience after all, Lilian,'! he remarked; " mere necessity." "I thought you would say that ; but I have learned like one who went before me to consider this as the very highest quality vouchsafed to man, and so a good foundation, if no more, for hap- piness." She told him then of her grandmother's often expressed opinion on this subject, and her own singular want of it, for which she tried in vain to substitute mere fortitude-opening unconsciously as she proceeded in her account of this beloved relative, leaf after leaf of her character, so as to interest her hearer deeply-and in   THE IIOUSETOLD OF BOUVERIE.       181 this process of description he observed more than ever, a peculiarity which had struck him from the first, whenever her sulbjcts elevated her from the colmmonplace, in the mode of speech of the narrator. There were times when he found it impossible to foresee the termination of her sentences, and yet, when these were completed, they satisfied him, even as they surprised, with their fullness and -comprehensiveness of meaning. He remarked this to her at last. She accounted for a peculi- arity of which .she had been made conscious before (and herself esteemed a defect) from the fact that she had lived much alone- or with those who found their chief companionship in books. This habit of communion had banished from their conversation much that was merely conventional and idiomatic. She thought her own devotion to poetic culture might have in- creased this tendency to express her ideas fully and compactly, yet often with an unpardonable inversion of words. There must, however, exist in every temperament, anid again in every individual mind, a governing principle of style as a vehicle for thought, which, whatever influences of education may have been brought to bear. upon it, will penetrate all disguises; and this, I suppose, was more than aught else the cause of this pecu- liarity of Lilian, if such it really were. The stride of Achilles betrayed him when he wore a woman's robe, even before his man's nature broke forth at the sight of a sword, and so we feel the clutch of the vigorous hand through all the films of fiction, and see the footprints of a conqueror often where a weary pilgrim seemed to pass. Again, under the philosopher's gown we detect sometimes the Ffaltering step and feeble frame, and the sounding technicalities i    182       THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERTE. drop to dust-lwhich his own words are too weak to uphold, propped as they are on his slender staff of intellect. We want individuality in style, if all else fails, whether in preacher or lecturer, or essayist. Let the words he speaks be the man's own wo'ds, fresh from his own nature, full oa   wn being, and we can for. give many shortcomings.               ,          .    !.: JTHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVKRIE.                183 X               CECHAPTERK II. As it is chiefly from what transpired during Colonel de Courcy's brief visit to Bouverie, that I must gather the materials necessary to conclude the abruptly terminated narrative of Lilian de Courcy, I will record in this place another conversation that occurred I  between them soon after the first, of no especial interest it is true, save that it reaches back into the otherwise unnoted time that succeeded the death of Mr. Bouverie.  Colonel de Courcy and Lady Edith had walked together to the cemnetery in the cedar grove, to visit the graves of Lilian's relatives. She had not wished to accompany them, blut 'seemed gratified when they expressed the desire to pay this mournful tribute to the dead. They found the burying spot a retired and deeply shadowed place, a favorite haunt for birds, which built undisturbed among the spreading yew and cedar branches, and gave its only life to that solemn solitude. An obelisk stood in the centre of the cir- cular-marble railed inclosure, bearing two simple inscriptions on its opposite sides in memory of the dead: "Erastus Bouverie-Infelix. Camilla Bouverie-Fidelis." Fronting the gate, it, presented the usual prayer for peace in the simple accustomed words "Implora pace ;" that universal cry of the weary human soul. On either side were grassy graves inclosed in oval bands of white marble finely sculptured in imita-   184      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEJTE. tion of ivy leaves, within which slept that strangely fated pair. The sarcophagus of Jasper Quintilian stood apart, shaped like a colossal coffin covered with a fringed pall, the corners of which were lifted by angels, so as to show a simple inscription beneath. His name, his age (soaring above which, appeared the figure of a dove, with outspread wings, surrounded with rays) and the comforting words: " ie giveth his beloved sleep."    These were all that the exquisitely wrought marbld drapery disclosed. The angels were those of life and death ; one radiant, hopeful, plumed for flight, the other mournful, yet beautiful, with folded wings and inverted torch. These, too, were the work of a native artist, though executed in Italy. A close observer might, on the base of the sarcophagus, have discerned, engraved in small letters the line from Psalms, which expressed the yearning grief of one who lingered behind- L My soul followeth hard after thee." Two places for graves were marked out, one on either side of this mausoleum, bearing on the marble cross laid over each, the several names of "Paul," and "Lilian."  So should sleep together until the day of doom the members of the mournful house of Bouverie. On his return, Colonel de Courcy had remarked to Mrs. Quin- tilian his peculiar satisfaction in the sequestered beauty of the place, and the singularity of the graves. "' It was my grandmother's wish," she replied, " to have them constructed thus.- She charged us to keep both flowers and weeds from their surface, and to leave the grassy sod that covered them open to the rains,-and snow, and sunshine of heaven. She fancied that she should be oppressed even in death, by the weight of the ,   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       185 marble above her. She wanted the winds to blow freely across her resting-place. She included my grandfather in this request.  We had been hesitating some time whether or not to place the obelisk above him."' i "Did she survive him long?" "Between three and four years only. Her health declined from the time of his death. The change which she had looked for as a relief, under the peculiar circumstances that surrounded them both, proved insupportable to her when it came. The olow that knocked her chains away broke her heart, and her life resolved itself into gloom and despondency, only alleviated by the discharge of her religious duties-from which all vitality had long departed-and her deep love for me and mine. Had I been blessed with children, a new impulse might have filled her life, a IRnew object replaced the old for which no other substitution was possible. Accustomed as she had been so long to certain cares and duties of daily recurring necessity, she could not bear the void their absence left. I Her nature required in its very structure the strong motive of responsibility to make life supportable. She had shown this early in her passionate love of Jasper, IJ - the child of her adoption, and later in her care for me. We failed her in our maturity and self-reliance. She needed some- thing, to foster."* "Her death was peaceful, I presume ; not violent, not painful I S, hope?"   ' 1i   "A mere translation, as it seems to me. She declined surely and gradually for a time, yet without much suffering, never con- fined to her bed, even for a day; never unable to read or sew, or join us at meals'; she yet found exercise impossible and remained wholly within doors.   186      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. One day, we had been riding out, Mr. Quintilian and myself, and leaving our horses came to the great window at which we saw her sitting, that which gave from her chamber out upon the lawn. We had found a grove of crab apple-trees in our ride, and came back loaded with those odorous blossoms, which we knew she loved so well. It was May, a soft balmy evening, the , window was thrown up, she was reclining in her great chair, in a perfectly natural attitude, her book lying open on her knees, her eyes were closed, she was strangely pale ; I sawin a moment how it was. But Jasper would not believe the truth, even when' my shrieks were rending the air. He had no such privilege as this ; his lips were sealed, but-he fell down at her feet in strong agony, and grovelled on the ground." After a moment's hesitation she resumed her narrative to her attentive hearer. "Dr. Quintilian came; he was greatly shocked at first, yet very firm ; he had foreseen this long, and nerved himself to bear it; he knew that she had incurable disease of the heart, but he had deemed it useless to embitter her life and ours with such a knowledge. All that variable color, all those sudden spasms of pain, came from this, all that power, perhaps, to bear and to conceal. Disease was at the root of all." ' I think a death like this might be called the crown of a good life, as it would seem the curse of an'evil one," said Colonel de Courcy. "She was prepared to die, and she was saved the wearing pangs of dissolution." "I, too, have coime slowly to this conviction, but it did not seem to me thus at first. Later, in the great sorrows from which she was spared, I have seen the working of the hand in her case, ' that doeth all things well.'"   STHE HOUSEHOLD OF BO UVYEIE.       187 She survived not her friend and spiritual father, Bishop Clare, as she had hoped might be the case, and her grave was conse crated by his beloved hand. She was spared, too, the unspeak able anguish of seeing her Jasper expire. Mrs. Quintilian's lips trembled slightly and grew pale, and she sat mute for a moment, gazing out on space, with sad and yearn- ing eyles, as if the past had put aside the present. Great tears were slowly gathering now, but she put them back with a strong effort, and again turned to Colonel de Courcy, as if about to speak. He anticipated this intention, if such it was, by asking her in a tone of deep interest a question that had more than once "z occurred to him since he came to Bouverie. l8"Have you no record of these events, Lilian? The circum- Bi stances that surrounded your grandparents seem'to me so touch- ing, so romantic even as to deserve perpetuation." "I have written,]' she replied, "during the past spring and summer, assisted by my journal to some degree, a narrative em- bodying much that I have told you, much more that no one can ever know until I am dead. I have not yet been able to per- isuade or compel myself to write a syllable of what has occurred since my grandfather's death. The thread is broken there. Tp to that time the details are faithful, and yet I feel that the de- clining days of my grandmother's existence, my husband's noble life of art, lived chiefly after that period, and Bishop Clare's peaceful and evangelical death, which occurred under this roof, in my own arms, are all worthy of a place in this chronicle. But there is time enough to-add all these, to elaborate them, even; I shall probably live to be old; I feel this fatality in every vein, and it will be reserved for a coming generation to lead this   188      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. record. In addition to what I have written from my own expe- rience, I possess now a clue to the fate of my grandparents, which was wanting before; my grandmother's diary, faithfully kept for years, and confided by her will to Bishop Clare, fell at his demise, two years ago, into my hands, as was intended, perhaps, in the end, by its writer. It is my intention to make some extracts from this transcript of the past, and so com- plete my self-appointed task as historian of the ' Household of Iouverie. , "Do not delay the undertakinag, my dear friend," rejoined Colonel de Courcy, with animation. "Publish it at once under feigned names, and give me an opportunity of gratifying my in- terest and curiosity both before I die." "Indeed it is quite impossible," she said ; "my death only can be the signal for this publication, occur when it will, for in me wrill perish the last drop of the blood of Bouverie ; and the world, which knows so much already, is welcome to the whole when the race is extinct." "Then may the manuscript lie in limbo for eighty years!" "Thank you, the motive' of your wish is kind, its expression very heartfelt, but the result scarcely desirable. I have no desire to live to be old." "Do you know, my dear madam, that you reflect very seriously on the good taste of your only surviving kinsman when you make a remark like that?" "Forgive me, I cannot think of you as old; there is so much life, sympathy, enthusiasm about you. Now I should be a dreary old woman--sentimental, insupportable t' "You did not give me time to explain myself; I never sus- pected you for a moment of reflecting on my age, only on the   tHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       189 spirit of my wish for you. The fact is, that I so appreciate life that I should be glad to be quite sure that I should live as long as Dr. Parr, if it were God's will, and yet I that say these words have had a hard life, am somewhat dyspeptic, and almost sixty-five." "Was there never a time-when you looked upon life differ- ently?" she asked seriously.  ( Oh, yes, of course, several times. On the day of the ampu-  tation of my arm, after the storming of a mud fort in India, I i wanted them to let me die. I was seven and twenty then. They talked to me of glory and my youth, and all that sort of thing; but I cared for nothing but my shattered arm, and its great agony. "Again, when Mary Marsdale stood up to be married to Lord 8 Kildare, I tried to die-what folly all that seems now! A mere accident, not worth relating, saved me from blowing my brains out; perhaps, after all, though, it would amuse you to hear it. My monkey had fired off the pistol during my momentary absence, that I designed for self-destruction, and when I put it against my temples, it was minus a load. A fiat proceeding truly, but it  broke the spell. An officious friend watched me for a week I  after, to keep me from repeating the experiment, but he might have saved himself the trouble, the impulse was gone, and my love for Mary Marsdale along with it. The monkey cured every- thing." "The monkey was the tool of fate, you know," she said, half laughing.       '  "Perhaps so-who can judge? But after ths, Lilian, after this, in my mature age, when my young half sister-my idol-on whom all my pent-up feelings had concentrated themselves at   190      THE IIOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. last, threw off her allegiance to me, and fled from her school in Calcutta, with a man I detested--rightly or not God only knows -the wish for death became strong in my heart again. But I was older then, more resolute than before. I would not yield to the temptation. I opened my window, and threw the razor in the tarn below. I was afraid of myself, and would not have another, and let my beard grow, for I was out of reach of the tribes of barbers then, away on the borders of India, almost in the jungle. "The struggle passed, as I have said, but left me warped and embittered ; but I lived it down, as we live everything down finally, if we do but live long enough." "Everything but remorse." She spoke like one in a dream. "Aye true, but I have little experience of that," he rejoined, "save from one case of social injustice, to which I have pleaded guilty long ago." She did not hear him probably, for she went on speaking slowly, hesitating often, gazing out on space, as was her wont, at times of serious feelings-a habit, if not a heritage. "It takes many shapes," she pursued, "' this protean quality, which almost always disavows its real name. No man can repu- diate it though, strive as he will; it lies down and rises with him, sits at the board, glances on him from his books, makes discord in sweetest music, dashes the bead from wine, and. makes the draught thrice bitter. No man can live this down-it is the ghost of conscience.?' There was something so sad, so strange in this soliloquy, for as such he accepted it, that Colonel de Courcy forbore to break the spell by word or sign.   THE  HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       191 Some dark association seemed at work in the breast of the speaker. She had grown pale, and her features were fixed and sad. At last she rose, and making some slight excuse, passed from the room; nor did she rejoin him until the well-served dinner smoked on the board. i i' S                              ..   192      THE HOUSEhOLD OF BOUVEEIB. CHAPTER   III. MR. SULLIVAN, the young artist to whom reference has been made, completed a fine picture of Mrs. Quintilian, a few days before the departure of Lady Edith and her uncle. Colonel de Courcy complimented him  on the rapidity of his execution, and the speaking beauty and fidelity of the portrait. Dr. Quintilian, too, was charmed with the picture, and paid for it munificently. iAs they sat at breakfast on the last morning of Mr. Sullivan's stay at Bouverie, Colonel de Courcy suggested to him the ex- pediency of passing a year or two in Italy, and regretted having done this the next moment, when he saw what pain it occasioned him, to confess his inability to pursue a plan so congenial to his taste. He seemed a proud and delicate. minded man, to whom- any self-revelation was painful in the presence of strangers, yet willing to sacrifice even personal reluctance to the necessities of truth. The two elder gentlemen rose after breakfast, and accompanied Lady Edith and her joyous children on their ramble through the grounds, leaving Mrs. Quintilian, as she wished to be left, alone with the young artist. She took this occasion to frankly offer him such pecuniary assistance, as he might need for the prosecu- tion of his profession, in her eyes the noblest of. all, and its foreign studies.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        193 When he would have thanked her, with the addition of the honorable declaration, that he craved pecuniary assistance from no one, and was content to struggle for the golden meed of fame, unaided, she stopped him with the truth. "My husband was an artist, Mr. Sullivan, not without some claims to distinction, and with the true feeling of brotherhood- for his class. I feel that I am honoring his memory and vocation both, when I set apart a portion of the income he left in my hands, to be used for the benefit of his brother artists. I am sure such a course would meet his approbation,- could he know of it, and, whether you accept or reject it, the means will still be so appropriated. Now, I do not think I could apply this fund better than to place it in your keeping for two years." With arguments like these, aided by his own strong love of art, she smoothed away Mr. Sullivan's objections, and induced him at last to accept her bounty. - "But you will suffer me to repay you," he urged; " when I am able!"  "Certainly," she answered ; " and the Artist Fund will be the better for your success. When I am dead, Mr. Sullivan, this system will be continued on a larger scale, through the means of trustees-so you see it is only a hobby of mine after all, and there must be no individual feeling about it." Her kindness, her natural manner completely broke down the walls of his reserve, and before they parted he had laid his aspirations before her. A little romance, too, had leaked out despite his caution-and Lilian learned that he loved a beautiful girl, who would wait forhim, aye, until the last of life, rather than marry another. VOL. Ii.--9   194      THE HOUSEITOLD OF BOUVElTE. But her relatives refused their consent to her union with a penniless artist so bitterly, that he felt nothing but fame and gold would overcome their prejudices, entertained, not so much against himself as his class, which certain practical and money- wise persons confound with the "Classe Bohemienne.7" And now, with a hearty wring of the hand, and a choking in the throat, that prevented parting compliment (unmistakable sign of feeling 1) Sullivan was gone. When Dr. Quintilian came in alone, Lilian told him what she had done, and what difficulty she had found in smoothing away the sense of obligation from Mr. Sullivan's mind. He listened with interest to her recital. "The matter is to be put into effect at once,1" she said; "he has agreed to take the first packet for Leghorn, and the checks must go off by the evening train to meet him in New York. Please, draw them up at once, and let me sign them ; Oh I what a privilege it is to be enabled to do good to such a man as this ; so modest, so gifted, so deserving, so devoted too," she murmured. She seemed elated with the benevolent scheme that employed her mind. Never had her eyes looked brighter, her lips more radiant than at that moment. Dr. Quintilian laughed as he rose from writ- ing the checks, and placed them beforesher for her signature. "Better buy jewels, Lily, and take the tour of Europe your- self, like other women of your age and means. Don't you think you could write a few flash letters home as well as the rest of them, and establish a 'deathless fame,' instead of pampering painter puppies, and multiplying parodies on those grave humbugs the 'old masters?'  You are unusually severe to-day-or do you only mean to be facetious? If the last, pray abandon the delusion."   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUlVERIE.       195 "After all, Lily," he went on as he folded and inclosed the checks, " if it suits you to bestow your means thus, it is all for the best, I suppose ; I certainly have no objections. It is well enough, perhaps," he said, glancing humorously at her, " that, you should extend h little present aid to the 'meritorious young artists,' mentioned so liberally in that will-of yours, which you may change yet before the end-who knows?-for if they wait for you to de- part this life, they will be old, decrepit failures before they receive relief, and another crop of daubsters will have sprung up on the roadside. Your contemporaries have little chance of profit through you, Lily, without an accident." "Aye, without an accident I Those were the very words Bishop Clare used years ago, when he prophesied long life for me,"? she rejoined, musingly ; "I recall the sentence so vividly to-day, 'you will yet find yourself alone with God.'  She was silent for a time, perhaps living over again that pain- ful scene, when' uncertainty and anguish shadowed every heart in Bouverie. After sealing and directing the letters, Dr. Quintil busied him- self with a newspaper, which he laid aside, however, with his spec- tacles, as she suddenly turned and placed her hand upon his arm. "Do you not think after all that I am singularly protected from accident?" she asked. 'd You know of several instances of almost providential interference in my behalf. That of the falling of the wire bridge, just as the train had cleared it, in which so many others were included, the most signal. But let me give you another, forgotten until now. It occurred when you were last in Baltimore, two weeks ago to-day, I think. I had occasion to go to the depot in person to deposit an important letter. As I passed the magnificent elm-tree, at the eastern gate--'Mor   196      aTHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. decai" as my grandfather called it, because it obscured the view so much from the drawing-room window-just changing its color then from green to brown, and yellow, and crimson, and Tyrian purple-I never saw such hues on any tree-I called to Phelim to pause beneath it, that I might 'feast my eyes on the grand beauty of that lower sweeping limb, stretched out like a king's sceptre; like the wand of Ahasuerus himself. So he checked the horses and I sat for a few minutes drinking in as many colors as a dying dolphin ever gave out, until my senses were perfectly permeated with the glory of that tree. Now, don't smile I I do not often bore you with descriptions, but you must understand how I enjoyed my ' XordecaiI on that autumn day, for the last time, you know. When I returned fifteen minutes later, after accomplishing the errand which took me out, half of that huge bulk lay across the road, the trunk and the lower limb were all that remained of my glorious forest king." "It was hollow-hearted; I have known it long, but Mrs. Bouverie loved it and I could not bear to cut it down-what an escape!"Dr. Quintilian added with emotion, "truly a signal in- stance of God's good providence." "Had it fallen when I paused beneath it," she said, " carriage, horses, human beings, must all have been crushed in one homoge- neous mass, and yet the wind was blowing as wildly then as later. A sort of herald of the equinox was out that day, I remember - one of those balmy-joyous life-giving winds, that prevail only at those periods, and on the sea." "They had cleared the tree away before I returned," he said, thoughtfully; "nobody told me of this, and I was glad it had fallen at last, without injuy to anything ; I was surprised, though, for it has been in the same condition for ten years past,"   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       197 "' I know not," Liliian said, "whether to regard it as a warning or a sign, that I am reserved for some good work, or some great suffering-one or the other-some end to be accomplished yet. I suppose after all," she added with a smile, seeing that Dr. Quintilian seemed gloomy, "that it, means, I am to live to be very old--survive you, Bianca, Pat McCormick even-and learn to love life as Colonel de Courcy says he loves his for its own sake. This seems to me the worst feature after all about old age. People do so learn to love, those sibylline books, their years, as they diminish in number. I hope I shall never know- this avarice of life-and that the poor young artists may come to their own before my eye fails its fire, or my hair grows grey, or my right hand loses its cunning."' "( Lily, Lily, it is a ,sin and a shame for you to talk in this way, selfish even to entertain such thoughts.. You forget that you have my eyes to close before you can think of shutting yours, and though I have lived temperately all my life, gout is my in- heritance, and I am beginning to feel its twinges. You know those hands of yours work miracles in pain, they are almost equal to Father Conrad's, and I can ill spare them from their ministry. After all, what would my life be without you, Lilian? .Have you ever seriously considered that? I shudder to think of, it I A boat without a rudder on a trackless sea, a loaded gun with no Ifire to set it off, a kite without a string, or a breath of wind to blow it about ; anything but useful, or good, or happy, would my life be, without you, Lily. Then never express such a wish again if you love or respect me." "I never will," she said, almost tearfully. "It was very rash and ungarded in me to talk so-not even heartfelt--I know not what impelled me, and yet," she added, "and yet I do wish: you   198      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. would think sometimes in a different spirit of the possibility of such a separation, and not regard 'me as invulnerable-immortal, -almost. Oh I I do wish you had lived more for yourself and less for others; this was the great mistake of your dear and noble life. Promise me that should I die before you (there is a bare possibility of this, you know), that you will try and be contented; seek a substitute--marry, even. Oh, promise me!" She spoke eagerly, clasping his hand in both of hers. He drew it hastily away, and turning off, though with evident agitation, resumed his spectacles and newspaper. In a moment the latter was thrown down, and he was on his feet again, walking the room this time in the old customary stormy way. "Child! child," he said, without stopping in his rapid pace, "why seek to conjure up difficulties? have we not had enough of these to contend with? All seems smooth now, and likely to re- main so - why imagine improbabilities, to say the least of it, to harass, to ruffle our peace?'? ' I can scarcely account for the mood myself," she said, "the whole matter seemed to press on me very suddenly and urgently, to-day, almost beyond my own consent.

It was not to be thought of," and clapping his hat hastily on his head, Dr. Quintilian left the room. A moment later, Lady Edith came in with the boys loaded with haws and acorns, autumn leaves, and a basketful of pawpaws, which they had gathered, assisted by Danvers, and which they persisted in calling " wild bananas."  Lilian could but admire. the animated and beautiful group, th0 mother, so young looking, joyous, healthful; the children, with their blonde beauty, truly handsome specimens of the Saxon type. The elder boy was called for his uncle Everard, and resembled him strikingly; the second bore the paternal name; a younger still, left with-his father and sister in Washington, in the hands of a careful governess and nurse, was named Reginald, after Colonel de Courcy, and seemed to be the darling of all. Lady Florence herself did not appear more than two and twenty, and yet-she was scarcely a twelvemonth younger than Lilian,' who looked every day of her age-every day of thirty, if not    200      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. more. A face never acquires the depth, expression, and charac- tel that belonged to hers until the impulsive season of youth is past. When the boys had gone out again with their treasures, and the ladies were alone, seated quietly for the morning at their respective embroidery, Lady Edith said: "Do you know to what you are indebted for the presence of these very troublesome boys of mine, for it was my wish to. leave them with Lord Sinclair, and break away from  all responsi- bility forma few days, instead of carrying it along? Listen, then. Solely and entirely to my uncle's dread of facing you unsupported." Lilian smiled, half surprised ; yet scarcely understanding Edith, perhaps, she said nothing. "They will be passports for us, you know," he said, in his par- tial way. "No heart could resist them, and after all, we need such letters of introduction as their faces present, to wipe out old scores." "I am almost glad you could not defend me, Edith, as their visit has been the result. They are such fine, merry fellows." "I did defend you indeed after this fashion: ' Her letters, uncle,' I urged, 'speak so sincerely of a perfect reconciliation, we must not doubt her earnestness.'" "H' Her face, niece i' was his reply. hIt is that from which I can gather my conviction on this point, far more than from her letters, and I have the most haunting wish to see it that ever pos- sessed sexagenarian bachelor I One might call it curiosity, if that were not a trait entirely confined to women.'  * - Lady Edith detailed this conversation to Lilian, with that peculiar naivet6 that made the charm of her manner, confessing   iTHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        201 that she, too, had her share of curiosity, though blended with deep interest, in coming to Bouverie. "And does your uncle believe in my letters, now that he has seen my face?" asked Lilian, half reproachfully. "I am almost afraid he believes a little too implicitly in both for his own peace or my comfort," said Lady Edith, laughing. "I shall hear the changes rung upon your name and perfections, when we go home, until I shall be ever so jealous. Nay, if he was twenty years younger, and I his dictator, he should not stay at Bouverie another hour." "He is a noble gentleman," rejoined Lilian, seriously, " and I thank him for his confidence ; but were he young instead of old, I scarcely think we should like each other half so well." There was something occasionally in Lilian's manner a little chilling to Edith. She felt it now. Was there, after all, lying deep in her nature, that same obstruction to intimate companion- ship, that she herself had likened in her grandmother's case to a "stone in a flower bed."  Or, was it that, unaccustomed to women and "their ways," Lilian unconsciously preserved with them the same reticence of manner she had learned fi'om the society of men? When she threw her arms around a friend, when she kissed her cheek, or clasped her hand warmly, she was moved by no common feeling. These caresses, with her so rarely con- ferred, meant something. They were not empty and enervating forms, as they usually are with women; and those who received such indications of friendship from Mrs. Quintilian, wondered what stirred and impressed them so, in the reception, and even in the remembrance of her salutations. Yet she was not cold in her manner, far from it. She merely held things sacred that others looked upon as common forms. 9*     202      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUtVERIE. The cup from which she drank was not for every lip; nor the stream of feeling poured freely for every wayfarer. When she tendered these, it was with her whole soul, and with a lavish generosity beyond all praise, all suspicion.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       203 CHAPTER IV. WHLE they were still sitting at work, Colonel de Courcy came Iin, holding in his hands an open book, he had found thrust away in the corner of a bookcase. "I like some of these poems very much indeed, Lilian," he said. "I had no idea, until I happened to ask Dr. Quintilian the name of the author, that you, too, were an artist." "A very imperfect one certainly," she replied. "And at the time those poems were written, I was far more impulsive than artistic. I think I could write better now." "Give me back, give me back the wild freshness of morning," he murmured, as he turned the pages over, still standing before her. "The criticism is perfect, and so delicate that I accept it kindly, in my declining age," she observed, smiling. "I like the poetry of the young best, I acknowledge," he said, fixing his eyes mildly on her face; "perhaps because I have so little critical culture, that I am not equal to more finished pro. ductions. I have never pursued poetry as a study, only as a pastime.' "You are in olving yourself more and more deeply by every explanation, Colonel de Courcy. Your latest expressed reason for liking my poems, is anything but flattering. You think with Tennyson, that they are 'easy things to understand.'" "Certainly that is their chiefest charm to me," he said, inno- cently.   204      TIE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. "You are perfectly incorrigible." i Why, uncle," broke in Lady Edith, quite red and flurried- she was something of a literalist in her way, like all very naive people--' I never knew you to exhibit so little tact before." Then there was a merry chime of laughter, in which Lady Edith joined at last, with a little bridling of the head, and a profession that she " only wanted to set things right." She could " see no- thing so diverting," and matters ended in Colonel de Courcy's insisting strenuously on reading aloud one poem, that had quite captivated his fancy, " suggested," the text declares, he went on to say, " by Mr. Bryant's beautiful poem--' The Future Life.' " "And who is Mr, Bryant?" he asked, gravely, stopping and putting down his eye-glass. "Oh, uncle, are you in earnest?" "Not know our American Wordsworth!" "Why, Colonel de Courcy, what will Lilian think!" The two last exclamatory phrases, uttered at the same moment by the astonished ladies, failed to produce any distinct impression on the ear of the offender, and he asked in piteous accents- "What have I done?" "Done, uncle!" reproachfully. "The question is unanswer- able,5 quoth Lilian, " in any way but one ;" and going in quest of a book, she soon returned with it, and insisted on reading first, the suggesting cause, if not the model of her own poem. When she had done reading the exquisite "Future Life," she said : "Now, Colonel de Courcy, I have made you acquainted with one of our laureates, our chief (we have two or three more). Do you think you will ever forget our patriarch?" Sompe spring of feeling had been touched in his emotional nature, probably by the poem. He made no remark at first,   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.         205 then observed merely : "That is true poetry." But in a tone that proved how heartfelt was the remark. "I cannot read as well as you have done," he said ; " nor do I know that your popetry is half so good; but it pleases me. Now, Edith, listen to 'The Spirit Meeting,' 'modelled,' Lilian says, on Mr. Bryant's ' Future Life,' 'suggested' by it, says the text." ,I would not insert this poem here ; but that it seems to have had strange relevancy with circumstances close at hand. THE SPIRIT MEETING. Thou did'st not know me in that lesser sphere, Where erst the cycle of our lives was cast;  Where, by thy side I walked through many a year, Each sadder, colder, darker, than the last, Though on thy lips, mine was a fiequent name; Though in thy gaze, I sat, by board and hearth; Though all our joys and sorrows seemed the same. Thou did'st not know me in the land of earth. How could'st thou deem ihat 'neath my dark, pale brow P Shrined in a form of slight and common mold, There dwelt an essence, such as meets thee now- Whose glance of power thou shrinkest to behold!- How scan the folded plumes of Paradise Within the clay that veiled a higher lot? No! thine were bounded-thine were mortal eye; I do not blame thee-that they knew me not. Yet, would I yield the glory and the grace, That breathe about me their ineffable light, To-see thee stand before thy M3aker's face, Freed from the stain-and ransomed from the blight    206'      THE HeOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. I would become, again, the child of dust, To know thee worthy of the crown of heaven, And bow once more beneath thy yoke unjust, To hear our Father say--"He is forgiven!" It may not be, no prayer, no deed of mine, Have yet availed to win that boon sublime: Pass on! await the meed, that love divine May yet reserve for thee in unborn time; With patient progress, and with quenchless faith, Repair the error of thy past estate;  And tread with fearless feet the thorny path That leads from death to heaven's celestial gate. "I had almost forgotten that," said Mrs. Quintilian, when Colonel de Courcy had finished his reading. "It has been so long since I looked through the volume ; but I think it contains some prettier things, perhaps. You will read them at your leisure, I hope, since you like this?"' "'You will give me this copy, then, to take away with me!" ( Not this, another, quite new; there are a dozen such upstairs in the library." She had seen Jasper's name in the flyleaf, written in his own hand. She could not part with that. It was sacred now. "Let me read one more before I stop." "Oh, no I Do not reproach me any further to-day with the sins of my youth." And she extended her hand for the book, which he relinquished reluctantly. ; "I will not let you forget your promise," he said; "in the meanwhile, can you recall no other you have made me since I came to Bouverie?" "I understand you.' She turned quite pale, even about the   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVE IE.       207 lips. "You leave to-morrow, would you like to see the picture now? You too, Lady Edith?" The person last addressed did not hear the proposition; the merry boys were calling to their mother, and she was preparing to go to them, with no ear for any one else. In another moment she had left the room. "It is better so, perhaps," thought Lilian; " none but the ear- nest eyes of -age and experience should see that picture, which it costs me so dear to -unveil." She had never recovered, probably, from the early emotions of awe and mystery with which she had first invested it, and since her grandfather's death other feelings had come to strengthen these. Yet she felt no such misgivings with regard to the other por- traits that surrounded the drawing-room. Those of her grand- mother, of Bishop Clare, of Jasper's self,-inspired her with tender regret alone. t What was there in thati dark picture that stirred her soul to agony and an unreasonable awe, she vainly strove to conquer? She led the way to the drawing-room, little used except, in the evenings. She threw open one of the windows, and let in a flood from the beautiful autumnal sunshine without, and standing before the fireless chimney, prepared to unveil the picture. A cord and tassel had been so adjusted with slender pulleys that one- standing on the floor could draw up the curtain now, with a slight exertion. Thus aided, Lilian raised the cloth gradu-  ally from the surface, until the whole painting was revealed. Colonel de Courcy's eyes were, riveted on the superb presence before!him for an instant,: as if in astonishment; then breaking forth in the excitement of the moment, with flashing eye and pointing finger, he exclaimed-    208      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEIrME. "The same ; I cannot be mistaken! I saw him more than thirty years ago at the Court of Nicholas. He was standing in the imperial group when I was presented, the stateliest man at court except the Czar. He was the remarkable personage-' the American engineer' to whom  the emperor gave his famous ' gnome eye ' jewel from his own hand. It was talked of through all St. Petersburg. I would know that peculiar face among a thousanid-am I not right, madam?" The curtain fell; something in the vehement manner of Colonel de Courcy had struck old chords too forcibly. Lilian leaned against the mantel-piece, covering her face with her hands, weep- ing convulsively. The storm passed in a moment. It was not often-oh! not often now, that her nature was swept to such a gust of tears. It was a part of the old being, and it served to freshen the arid monotony of the new. "My child! have I given you pain?" He laid his hand upon her shoulder ; he spoke in tender accents-the strong, the gentle man, the Christian soldier. "Oh, no, no I It was only a passing emotion, uncontrollable though for the moment. It is well so ; it has relieved me. But it seems so strange that you should have seen him, my broker,-- broken idol!"  She murmured the last words. Again a pause. "It is exquisitely painful to me to unveil this picture-you did not know that, of course. -How could you suspect such an un- reasonable thing of me? Sucl a weakness I Yet look at it when you will, henceforth alone." He took her hand and led her to the open window, from which the eye embraced a sunny stretch of lawn and flower borders, still gay with lingering dahas, chrysanthemums, and monthly bloom   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        209 ing roses (the last, ever latest to desert their summer allegiance), encircled and protected, as by strong arms of love, by the distant changing woods. For some time they stood in silence, gazing out on the scene before them-a silence only broken by the monotonous chirping of a Cardinal bird in the Norway fir before the portico. He turned to her abruptly at last- -"This place is too lonely for you," he said. "It will kill you-nay, it is killing you already by inches. Leave it. Put the past behind you--carve out a new destiny; you may still be happy. ' Let the dead bury their dead,' and come away." "This cannot- be, she answered, my fate is bound up with Bouverie. Think of Dr. Quintilian I he would be permanently contented nowhere else." "Contentment in such a life, stagnation rather 2 Did you not say yourself that peace was but one ingredient of happiness? There is nothing here to fill the requisitions of such an organiza- tion as yours. The most finely strung, the most comprehensive that I have ever beheld in woman." "Oh 1 thank you, thank you, your praises overpower me, they are partial, excessive. I do not deserve one tithe" "Answer me frankly, then, Lilian; I leave it to your own con- science," he interrupted, " to settle this matter definitely: Are all the requirements of your being filled in this solitude?" "Not all-not altogether, rather; but the wise man whose house is too large for his own use, manages easily to contract it, by closing a few doors, and abandoning a few rooms. It is thus that I have done. There are desolate chambers in my heart I never enter now, shall never Abide in again until the end of all. As to solitude, which, to most persons, seems such an insupportable evil, do not think me paradoxical when I tell you I have found it   210     rTHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEME. my closest, most congenial companion. I am accustomed to it, and I never feel so true to myself, so natural as when I am alone, Yet I enjoy social society very keenly; but we must not drink champagne every day, you know." Her eye sparkled, she smiled, the scarlet returned to her lip. It was one of those moments when beauty seemed her birthright. Her companion gazed at her long and admiringly. She had given a new impulse to his life, this woman, whose existence was stagnation in his opinion. "Point me, again,"' he said, " that slender magnolia-tree, that yesterday you told me you meant to remove from beneath its deep elm shadows, so that sunshine might deepen its green, and foster its long delayed time of blossoming." The tree was not far distant; she showed it to him readily. "Are you not afraid to transplant it," he said, ' when it has grown so long in the shade?" "Not at all, care and attention will compass almost any floral change." Hle turned to her suddenly, "Then let me be your gardener for once," he said. "Go with me, Lilian, away from Bouverie, back to Taunton Tower, make it your home, your heritage, my fair mag- nolia-tree "I and again he clasped her hand with his trembling fingers impetuously. She, too, trembled. His words meant little, but his manner was unmistakable. This revelation was unspeakably painful to her. "You are very kind," she said, in low accents, " and it may be that at no very distant day I may stand beneath your roof-tree in the old hall again, as your guest. But Bouverie is my home, must ever be, while life is mine ; yet do not think me ungrateful, Colonel de Courcy. Believe me, should we meet no more after   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       2" to-day, I shall never forget you, nor cease to honor you, my kinsman." She stooped, pressed her lips lightly upon his hand, then with- drawing her own from his grasp, was gone before he could speak to her, nor did they again meet save in the presence of witnessea   212      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. CHAPTER V. DR. QUINTILIAN had built a chapel on the confines of the domain of Bouverie, and near it a small parsonage. The neigh- bors, many of them persons of' culture and influence, had con- tributed to raise a salary for the officiating clergyman, and thronged the little church on every Sabbath-day. The building was simple, remarkable only for its exquisite pro- portions, so that it filled the eye, as a more elaborate edifice, less harmoniously constructed, could never have done. To build this chapel had been a favorite day-dream of Dr. Quin- tilian's for many years ; but, it was not until after the death of Erastus Bouverie (when his long-diverted income flowed into usual, channels) that he had felt at liberty to withdraw any portion of his own slender means from the support of the house- hold of which he formed a member. Although a Presbyterian, and as such not strictly entitled, perhaps, to bestow the name of chapel on the house he had erected for the worship of God, he was so liberal in his senti- ments, that the pulpit was open to all denominations, and thus the preaching at Bouverie was varied and interesting as that of no constantly officiating minister could-possibly be. ' It rested Mr. Vernon," Dr. Quintilian thought, " for others to take the pulpit in turns with him-and it rested other congre- gations for their preachers to leave them occasionally-and it rested those preachers to get rid of stereotyped faces now and then, and try their energies on fresh material." So his was, according to   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        213 him, a, system of rotation that afforded universal "rest and refreshment of spirit!"Who shall say that he was not right in this opinion? What single man can afford new weekly nourish- ment from his own individual resources for a thousand minds? "Besides, Vernon himself improves," Dr. Quintil would add ; "from hearing all this pulpit eloquence, he is unconsciously re- ceiving his second clerical education. His prayers have taken fresh wings of late-they were heavy enough when he first came among us, quite clogged with repetition; and as to his sermons, they are- twice as short and substantial and thorough-going as they used to be, and ten times more charitable.  He begins to believe that brimstone is not 'your only weari in the world to come, and we hear less of the Elect-that angelic aristocracy!" Colonel de Courcy and Lady Edith had accompanied their hosts on each of the two Sundays that-.found them inmates of Bouverie, to the Oak Wood Chapel. It happened that on both occasions eloquent preachers had filled the pulpit, invited perhaps especially by Dr. Quinitilian from the nearest city, and sharing his hospitality, eaih time, for a day and night, or two. They were men of different denominations and opposite cha- racteristics, yet alike courteous and liberal, in the expression and reception of opinion. One was a fiery speaker, the other a close and cogent reasoner, and as was natural to their temperaments, Dr. Quintil, the man of reason, preferred the first, Colonel de Courcy, the man of impulse, preferred the latter. Lilian delighted in pulpit eloquence, from which she had been shut out during all the years of her seclusion at Bouverie, until the chapel was built. She did not criticise nor discriminate greatly, not sufficiently perhaps; but she surrendered her whole being to   214      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VERIE. the preacher, as Christ's living representative, "doing," she thought, "a grand and mysterious work, to the best of his ability," whether with strength or weakness she little cared to investigate. It was not her business to do this, she thought; cer- tainly not her pleasure. She, went into the house of God with the meekness of a little child about to hear great lessons, partly incomprehensible, not the less thrillingly impressive on that account. None I think feel more entirely the holiness of the sanctuary than those long shut away from it by circumstances, and who learn thus to regard their presence in a church a privi- lege, not a mere matter of course. Imaginative people are, I believe, above all, most thrilled by the presence of the Invisible in his appointed temple. Such minds go far beyond   anything that a preacher feels privileged to speak, and take thought at its sources intuitively and sympathetically. It matters less for them, therefore, than for others what words are employed, what images displayed. They are in the very presence of the holy of holies. It was not thus with Lady Edith. Less imaginative, less culti- vated than Lilian, she was proportionably more exacting of these qualities in her minister, nor did she fail to express her admiration of, and astonishment at the gifts of those preachers she had heard at Bouverie. Colonel de Courcy, too, was earnest in his praises, and Dr. Quintilian highly gratified at these tributes from his guests. "We are undoubtedly," said he, "the most religious, because the freest people on earth. Nowhere is the word of God so widely spread, so truly revered as in the United States. Every  hearthstone is an altar, and every mother's heart a well of prayer. As for our preachers, they come among us like bro-   THEj HOUSEHOLD OF BOU V ElIE.       215 thers, not rulers, and the Bible is the corner stone of our consti- tution.'  Colonel de Courcy thought otherwise.   He thought that compulsory respect for the order of priesthood was a radical part of national prosperity. That as the "twig was bent, so the tree inclined," and that religion ought to be a part of govern- ment. Whole hburs were spent in that polite and useless contro- versy, which the reader can so well appreciate without further explanation Or detail. At the close of one of these political "]dialogues," for they hardly amounted to the dignity of conversation, being entirely devoid of its freedom and discursiveness, Dr.- Quintilian ventured to remind Colonel de Courcy, that in spite of his allegiance to established forms, he had avowed a few-days past, during their stroll through the oak forest, that his only profound and abiding impressions of Christianity had been derived from a wandering missionary, a dissenter and an enthusiast. "Say fanatic, rather," he admitted, laughingly, " for such he certainly proved himself later, when he set out, knapsack on shoulder, to walk from the borders of- India to the northern part of Russia, for the purpose of converting the Czar. He had been preaching to us, poor jungle-bound soldiers, for some months, purely for the love of the thing, and the pity he felt for our be- nighted condition, and not without effect. "' When men have been thrown together, until the hideousness of all hearts becomes manifest, with no other resource against such society than the companionship of Thugs, Sepoys, tigers, and crocodiles might afford them, they are glad to be persuaded that there is a pitying God, a self-sacrificing Saviour.   216      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VEJIE. "I am not ashamed to say, that I was completely carried off my feet by that strolling missionary, and that I received from the hand of 'Evan Meredith' the baptism, which as an infant had never been bestowed on me."' "Lilian started. How the name had thrilled her, -associated' as it was inextricably with the past. "What manner of man was he, Colonel de"Courcy?" she asked, earnestly. "Oh I a very apostolic sort of man, with a St. John counte- nance, full of peace and praise, with great fanatical-looking, beaming blue eyes. He had exquisite hands, I remember, and beautiful curling brown hair, which never looked rusty nor neglected, although no hat ever covered it. He looked like a woman, from his natural deficiency of beard-and wore a robe of some coarse blue fabric like an ancient Greek, or a Dervish rather. His voice was very musical, and he had a gift of persuasion (one could scarcely call it eloquence), and a sort of dignified meekness very peculiar-that was the most puzzling thing I Nobody ever laughed at any of his absurdities, though not for the want of the will, but the power. He disarmed one so I You would have been amused at his dinners. The angel that came to dine with Adam and Eve would have enjoyed them, probably.

"Strange, strange, indeedl" she answered, absently; "but it interests me so to hear' about him, pray proceed in your relation -tell me everything you know." ,%   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU'VERIE.       217 ' "There is little more to tell, except that we found out he was a suale-ch'u'mcr as well as a soul-charmer. One day he was sit- ting with me in my -tent, with several other officers (I might as well confess, we were holding a, sort of meetings-literally, a camp-meeting), when suddenly upstarted a cobra capella, almost before my very face! [ Of course, I sprang back in great con- sternation; others more remote got hastily out of the way, but I could not do this, I was so near the corner of the tent. "There stood the frightful thing poising himself before me- death in his very glance; you cannot think how hideous these creatures are, with their great muffled throats and grinning serpent faces, and burning eyes, of devilish malignity-Satan him- self took such a form, I know, when he tempted Eve; but why digress? The crisis was stringent, I was so agitated that I was almost ready to capitulate, having an instinctive weakness about serpents that amounts to positive cowardice. "I staggered back against the canvas of the tent; in another moment I should have fallen, when I heard a low musical squeal, if such a thing could be-just such a noise as the singing-mouse must have made, prolonged, thrilling, sharp, loudening, but not deepening,- gradually, until it filled the tent with its wild, wailing melody. It recalled me to my senses. I started, I looked around, and as I live, Dr. Quintilian, I saw the snake lying mo- tionless at the feet of Evan Meredith I In another moment, still playing on the singular pipe he held to his lips, he turned and left the tent, and the snake crept after him. I had never seen any- thing like that before, even among native snake-charmers, and the palanquin-bearers called it witchcraft. "Soon after that Evan Meredith disappeared, without a single farewell ; but I, who had so often heard him declare it his voca- VOL.  10.--10 .   218      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. tion, ever believed that he journeyed to St. Petersburg on foot, to convert the Czar--Lucifer himself. "I was strengthened in this belief some years later, by an ac- count given me in Calcutta, by a brother officer, who had seen a most peculiar-looking man surrounded by an agitated crowd, dressed in that singular blue cotton robe, and wearing long, tangled curls, praying in the great square of St. Isaac's, under the statue of Peter the Great, for the Czar, and his salvation. "The police quickly swept him out of siglit; but what became of him none ever knew. The acts of Nicholas were all mys- terious, never magnanimous, you know."  "He died a martyr," said Lilian, deeply moved. "' I am so glad, to have known his earlier history!" "Why, Lilian-this was the tenant of the Russian prison, whose death made way for your grandfather I It is a wonderful coincidence, to be sure. We have his Bible with all its strange marginal notes, and the shell of the tortoise he charmed, as he did the cobra capella, and his singular lute. Lilian, relate the circumstances as you heard them, to Colonel de Courcy." Mrs. Quintilian then told what she knew- of Evan Meredith, in connection with her grandfather and the Russian prison, and thus another link was added by this seeming chance, to the history of the "Household of Bouverie."'   I            THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        219 CHAPTER VI. IT was after the late dinner of the day that preceded his depar- ture from Bouverie, the same day on which Lilian had shown him her grandfather's portrait, that Colonel de Courcy reminded her of her promise made in the morning to give him a volume of her poems. She determined to go at once in quest of this, while her guests adjourned to the drawing-room, and gathered around the blazing fire, built even more for cheerfulness than warmth, andr heaped with freshy cut pine branches, in the olden autumnal fashion of Bouverie. Entering the lateral hall, from which' all partitions had been removed, so that it swept now, as it had originally done, across the whole breadth of the house ; she opened a door, leading from it into a square tower, one of two not long since erected, in the angular recesses formed'by the projection of the large octagon chamber, from the main building ; and, almost in darkness, com- menced the ascent of the winding stairway it contained. This stair was one she used for domestic and private purposes alone. That contained in the tower on the other hand, wider, and better finished and with the dome above it open to the summit, with its great clock in full view, was reserved for the use of guests. Both of these stairs led to the lateral hall above, freed as well as that beneath, from all partitions now, and into which the  doors of the guest-chambers opened on the opposite side.

At the head of the left hand stair, which Mrs. Quintilian ascended now, there was a small square landing, presenting two doors; that in front led into the lateral hall, and faced the por- tal of the opposite bedroom; that on the side gave into a minia- ture apartment, partly lined with shelves. The western tower    I was thus divided into two floors, and of this turret-chamber, Mrs.  Quintilian only knew the mystery ; no one else ever set foot there. I She even did not enter it often, and never without emotion. There  she had treasured all, her sacred relics of the past. Jasper's un-  finished pictures, his easel, his very pallets still stained with their : various faded colors; the old Silenus mask itself was carefully proe-  served. On the wall hung the lyre, the shell of 3erodach, the study robe of velvet, the brocade dressing gown, one and all, so personally  connected with her grandfather. In a small ebony case of      A drawers beneath, were all of his chemical effects that could be ti- I found after the explosion, some uncut jewels, and the mother of  I pearl casket holding its inestimable "gnome eye." The pyramidal  I vial, containing what remained of his medicine at the period of his death still threw out amber light whenever brought even for a moment from  its dark receptacle, and still exhibited the strange phenomenon of the writhing and collapsing tiny golden serpent, when agitated at all. tHer grandmother's rosary, crucifix, Prie Dieu, breviary were also there, and the book still I lying open as they found it on her knees, on the day of her death,  containing the sermons of Bossuet. Other memorials, too nume- rous to mention, were likewise carefully preserved ; but I digress in enumerating these things here, nor was it to this room that Lilian's ij -           j   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        221 steps were directed on the evening in question. She passed the door with a rapid step and opened that immediately in front. which gave into the upper entry. As she emerged from it a bat whirled blindly past her, striking her cheek with its wingin its flight, and startling her slightly. For a moment the idea of turning back for a candle occurred to her, but there was still light enough from the western window of the hall to guide her to the rotunda, from the skylight of which she knew mult stream a still stronger radiance. A few red beams from the declining sun chequered the -floor as she entered the library ; these faded, how- ever, after a few moments, suddenly away into greyness and un- distinguishable shadow. She had in the short interval of time I have indicated,'however, between sunset and the rapid succession of autumn twilight, secured the book which made her errand, and was turning to leave .the rotunda, with, an unquiet haste, quite foreign from her usual calmness of movement, when her steps were arrested, her ear ravished by a low thrilling sound, that seemed to rise from the floor, and gradually fill the rotunda with its wild, low, wailing melody. It recalled vividly the notes drawn from the lyre of Merodach, but was louder, wilder, more ear- piercing and overpowering than any tones of that instrument. Just as her senses seemed to reel before-its prolonged intensity of vibrations, it lessened in volume, and in searching power, and gradually died away with a plaintive wail into perfect silence. Simultaneously with the decline of this singular sound, with its unmistakable associations, Lilian saw, with distended eyes, glid. ilg among the shadows a dull, violet-colored flame, that after a moment or two sped swiftly across the floor of the rotunda from the external wall, and flickered around her feet. Then, in that voice so long familiar, so long silent, that pecu-   222      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.              liar, never-to-be-mistaken voice, with its silvery articulation, its j pathetic vibrations came forth-that word, more soul-stirring in such tones than any other her ear had ever received-her own name uttered thrice in accents of passionate appeal-  "Lilian! Lilian I Lilian!" So rang out the thrilling cry of the ;S dead-mournful, wild, despairing, as the wail of the winter wind. ? Her feet grew to the floor, her head seemed to reach the dome : above her, in the elation of her agony, and for an instant her   i heart beat wildly, as if endued with a separate volition; it was I trying to tear- itself from her bosom, and throw itself, bare, pal- I pitating, and bleeding, past i{er throat, against her very lips.  I Then came a momentary reaction. The book dropped to the floor   ! with a dull, death-like sound, as throwing her hands wildly up she r plunged forward into the shadow, as if to grasp the flame which  i still eluded her, and with the word "grandfather" quivering on her lips, fell with her arms extended, senseless on the floor.  I It was thus that Bianca found her an hour later, when the arrival k of guests. made it necessary to seek her. But of the incident    just described (if such it might be called) nothing was said, and I it was only to the trembling Bianca that Lilian revealed the cause I of her sudden swoon.                         When the tea urn steamed on the table, Mrs. Quintiliani entered the dining-room, pale, yet quite collected, and bearing the requested book of poems in her hand. A slight allusion to' transient indisposition satisfied every one as to the motive of her absence, yet she did not recover her spirits, norparticipate in the gaiety and almost hilarious enjoy. ment of her guests, to the number of which two more had been unexpectedly added. Governor Staunton and Mr. Clavering had galloped over from   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VERIE.       223 Grosvenor, where the last was making an autumnal visit, accord- ing to custom, to call on the English guests of Mrs. Quintilian. They brought in fresh elements for conversation, and Dr. Quin- tilian was drawn out artistically by those who understood him of old, so that he revealed undiscovered treasures of humor, until now lost on Colonel de Courcy, or rather by him unsuspected. Mr. Clavering seemed charmed with Lady Edith and her beautiful boys, and Lilian surveyed the scene with calm satisfac- tion, yet the burden at her heart, and the physical weariness she felt prevented her enjoyment. The eager, bustling children had disappeared, the first exhilaration of conversation was over, the night wore on. . Governor Staunton had obtained possession of Lady Edith's ear. Mr. Clavering was released, and found him- self soon where he always preferred to be, sitting by Lilian's side.  "You are 'distraite' to-night," he said, "what ails you? I fear there is something more than mere indisposition at work. Do tell me how I can serve you?" She did not reply immediately. "Who cares for me as he does, after all?" she thought. "Am I not unwise, perverse, per- haps, to put away such unwearying affection? Twelve years of I constancy--should these go for nothing? Might I rot be happy, 'as the word is commonly understood-far happier than I am now with such a man as he? What is this fond madness that binds me, Ixion-like, on the wheel of the past?" Quickly as light these thoughts swept through her brain; but she only said-- "Yes, you are right; there is something more than mere physical languor wrong with me to-night, but do not ask me about it yet; another time I will tell you, probably; but it is too   224      THE HOUSEHOLD Or BOUVERIE.           ! recent, too mysterious now. Try and distract Dr. Quintilian's attention from me, if possible; if he speaks to me I shall break down completely. You know I must sustain myself until they go, and then--oh, Mr. Clavering, what then?" She gazed in his face with wild and wistful eyes. "Colonel de Courcy is right. Bouverie is killing me, soul and body," she murmured, as she drew her fingers slowly across her brow;            ! He had never seen her so wrung, so wildly agitated. It was a relief to both when the footman came in and -announced a colla- i tion ready in the dining-room. A storm had risen unobserved  without, a sudden equinoctial gale, while all were more or less en- I gaged in social enjoyment. The lightning blazed through the Transom  glass, above the front door of the vestibule, as they I crossed the dimly-lighted hall to reach the supper-room, and soon tthe rain was heard driving furiously against the window-panes, t the shutters of which were still unclosed. There was a strange stillness among those who gathered around - the board (on which the usual fruits, wines, ices, meats, and salads i were served), caused probably by the sudden violence of the storm, : which often, when electric, I think exercises a crushing influence over mere animal spirits from mechanical causes. Or, it may   ; have been that Mrs. Quintilian's peculiar quietude and pallor had ; at last attracted attention, and awakened sympathy. In the midst of this lull of life, there came a crash, so sudden : and terrific, so near at hand, that a bomb-shell bursting on the i. roof could scarcely have been so startling. The glass, brimming  with wine, was struck by the concussion from Governor Staunton's hand, and the floor trembled, as if beset by terrors. The gentlemen I rushed simultaneously to the hall, whence the sound proceeded. Lilian, wildly agitated, clung to Lady Edith, and was borne,     THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.         25 half fainting, to her room, where she lay, in a trance-like condli tion of nervous ecstasy, for hours, not swooning nor insensible, but nerveless and motionless. The consequence of this seizure was slight illness, which confined her to her bed for twenty-four hours afterward. Before she was able to rally entirely, her guests were gone -two to Grosvenor, the rest' to Washington--not however without a personal interchange of farewell courtesies on her part with the last, from whom her separation might be of years. It had been determined not to acquaint her with the extent of injury inflicted by the storm, until her nerves should be in better condition. Toward evening, Dr. Quint'lian ventured to communicate the truth. The electric fluid had struck the chim- ney of the drawing-room, and glancing downward, without injury to the chamber above, had been attracted from its path, probably by the large iron hooks that supported the picture of Erastus Bouverie, and which penetrated the walls above the mantel into the flue itself. The consequence had been the destruction of that superb paint ing, which was found lying on the carpet scorched to cinders. The mere remnant that remained was of no value, embracing as it did the lower part of the figure and the background above the. head alone ; singularly enough the frame was uninjured. Lilian bore this announcement with a sort of bitter patience, and now it became her turn to relate her strange vision to Dr. Quitrtilian-a vision thus far realized, as it might seem to the mind inclined to superstition. Again a dark shadow, never to be dispelled, brooded ovr-e the household of Bouverie, swept perhaps this time from the lm ysF terious wing of destiny itself.   226      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.     -i CHAPTER VII.  A MONTH later, Lady Edith Sinclair returned to Bouverie.  it She came on this occasion unannounced, and walked the mile : from the depot to the mansion, through the long avenue of half leafless oaks that skirted the road, leaning on her husband's arm. Children and servants had been left behind as supernumeraries. No carriage had been summoned.  She came this time in the  ;; capacity of a humble minister to an overpowering affliction. Again Bianca opened the door to admit the guests, bursting into tears as she did so, and covering her face with one hand, : while she extended the other to Lady Edith. "Ohl, bless you, bless you, my lady, you have come to a wretched house-walk in."   And she mechanically proceeded to open the drawing-room door. Then wiping her eyes, she asked-- "Where is Colonel de Courcy? This is another gentleman."  : "My husband, Bianca, Lord Sinclair."   She courtesied low.  "Colonel de Courcy sailed for England the very day before that disaster."  "Don't name it, my lady.  It seems like a miserable dream  i still. I can't believe it is true. I am half crazed, I believe'." "Oh, no, Bianca, your feelings are perfectly natural under the : pressure of extreme sorrow. I even, who knew her so briefly, have felt almost amazed with grief."               "An angel like her, my lady, to be so given up to the hands : of the evil one!" -       -              3 "God directs all, Bianca."    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       227 "We don't know, Lady Edith. See how Job, the just man, was surrendered to Lucifer. Think of those warnings." Lady Edith had never heard of them, and did not understand her allusion. She hastened to inquire for Dr. Quintilian, whose desolate condition moved all her sympathies. "How does he seem, Bianca?" she asked. "Oh, poorly, madam, poorly ; yet he bears up like a man. Shall I tell him you are here, Lady Edith? I think he" will receive you at once, if not the gentleman." "Do so, if you please. Add that Lord Sinclair wishes to take him by the hand, but that we can wait one, two, three days, as he pleases, until he is prepared to see us-wait his own good time." The husband of Lady Edith, still a stranger at Bouverie, was a diplomatist of some distinction,' then on a mission from England to the United States. He was an intelligent though scarcely intellectual man, firm of purpose, honorable in character, fine looking, fresh colored, and about fifteen years older than his wife, between whom and himself there existed an unusual con- geniality as well as attachment. It must not be concealed, that he had accompanied Lady Edith to Bouverie with considerable reluctance, and merely from a sense of duty. His English horrors .of scenes to which he supposed Americans to be addicted, made him nervously apprehensive of his interview with Dr. Quintilian. It was, therefore, with unfeigned disappointment that he found himself included in the invitation to go into the presence of the sorrowing man, when Bianca returned. She ushered the guests into the dining-room, where Dr. Quin. tilian was seated in his great chair by the fire. He advanced to t    228      THE HOUSEHOLD OF EOUVERIE.  mneet them as they entered with extended hands, but without the  power to articulate a syllable HHe had counted on greater self- ; possession, and it was not without mortification that lie found himself so suddenly overcome--" intcrdit ' as it were. With a  mute gesture he invited them to be seated, then takingu out his  large pocket-halndkerchief, he walked to the window and stood   I awhile, burying, his face in its folds, giving way to a hearty burst T s of silent grief. When, after a 'Tew moments, he turned and  approached his guests again, his features were quite .composed, and he had wiped away the traces of his tears.          I "We have a fine autumn, Lord Sinclair," were the words he : mechanically uttered, as lie reseated himself.          :: "A  lovelier season I never saw," was the relieved response of the Englislman, who " hated scenes." "Your climate surpasses   i ours, certainly, at this period of the year."  "Your   boys are well, I hope?" turning to Lady  Edithl   X abruptly. "Why did you not bring. them down?"  "We feared they might disturb you at this time, Dr. Quin- tilian ; children are so noisy, so unsympathizing." "Ah  !" he waved his hand, and half rose in the chair he had  taken, as if impatient of the faintest allusion to his condition, his irreparable loss, at least from another. "You are better, Dr. Quintilian, than I dared hope to see you?"  "Yes, better ;  as well, probably, as I shall ever be again-,-the nature of things is fixed now ;" then hesitating, he added; "I should have been pleased to have seen Colonel de Courcy."     )j "He   has sailedl very unexpectedly, for England. "  "  Gone home, has lie? Home! what a word! as if place had anything to do with home  after all," he muttered. "He, too, will be quite lonely for a season," he added, speaking louder.   THE HOUSE HOLD OF BOUVERIE.       229 p I        4 "Yes, until we return." -  "Return!"3 He smiled, half bitterly, as he repeated the word, so vain to him-plunged the fire-irons in among the coals, and stirred to life their dull, bituminous blaze-then rising abruptly, rang the bell." A footman answered the summons. "Refreshments, James, at once, for Lord and Lady Sinclair. They breakfasted early-go to Bianca." He spoke mechanically--then sinking back in his chair again, fell into a deep musing silence. He was startled by the entrance of the servant with a tray. "I forget myself strangely to-day," he said, rousing from his reverie. "Pardon me, madam, sir? lord?" "Sinclair." The word was supplied in a whisper by Lady Edith. "Aye, Lord Sinclair, I lose myself constantly.  Truly, a noble name, and one often heard by me with pleasure, in times gone by-connected as it was with so much that was fearless and honest in diplomacy, a profession in which usually but little of such leaven is found." He was making a great effort riow; but his voice sounded forced and hollow. ' Eat, I pray you,'7 he added, with a wave of his hand, "if anything there appears worthy of your appetites. The wine is good, mister-Lord-Sinclair," with his hand to his brow, as if to fix an idea. "Don't be afraid of it-old, and of a choice vintage. The grapes, they say, grew over the site of an earthquake-covered city somewhere in the south of Portugal, I forget the name of the place, just now. I wonder,'3 he muttered, " if moral earth, quakes ever produce good- fruit--anything better than sorrow,   230      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. * shame, remorse, despair, or all that sort of thing? That old fable of the house of Atreus-what a terrible thing it was!"  In the very irrelevance of these words there was much that was impressive, awful even, to his hearers.            H He rose, and walked away, and again stood by the window, apparently gazing out upon the lovely scene before him; pre- sently he returned.                       ,I "The mystery of the atonement is forced upon me very won-    X derfully of late," he said, resuming his seat, and speaking low, fe with his eyes fixed on the fire, "not only as we understand it in -t the Saviour's case, but as a component part of man's nature, ex- . isting through all time-a necessity even. Men have always con- ciliated sin with sacrifice. The Cretans offered up the loveliest of the Greek youth to their hideous Minotaur monster. The Pe-    i ruvians and Egyptians propitiated  thus their priest-goveAed idols: Iambs, doves, innocent maidens, all the purest, sweetest  l creatures in nature, have  been selected for such offering. Who ever thought of offering a wolf, or panther, as a holo-    : caust?  Why is this?  Why does he sanction   such terrific   j wrong?   I confess I cannot understand it all, nor shall until  the day of doom."     '        . "We are not called upon to understand, only to submit," said Lady Edith, who now drew her chair beside him (having tasted only a morsel from the various food before her), and thus replied to his soliloquy.                         "S "Aye, submission is a necessity, I know, a part of policy even as we are situated, for, like the blindworm, we can only sting our-  selves by rebellion. It is not to be supposed that the Creator cares even if he knows."                       i "  Pause, Dr. Quintilian I You, a religious man, to utter such    i THE/HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.     .  231 a sentiment I It pains me to the heart. Remember, that' whom , He loveth he chasteneth."7 1 "May there not be too much chastening? Is it not a com- mon error of disciplinarians to overdo chastisement? Sorrow must stop at the right point to be advantageous to the human soul. It had stopped at the right point with me ; why overshoot the mark? The Scriptures compare God to a refiner of silver, a very subtile and beautiful comparison, when the delicate process of refining this metal is understood. We know how easily it is over- done, how necessary it is to discriminate. I am afraid the Great Refiner overdoes his work, also, in some souls.' Again that fearful accusation of levity against the Creator! Lady Edith was inexpressibly shocked; was the noble, self- denying, truly religious life of this man all to end in cold despair and a bitter sense of injury? Would- not God call his child to his arms again? Would he not heed the call? She determined no longer to avoid direct allusion to the subject of his grief. She would probe the wound, and bring about a more healthy action. She would force him to his knees if only- through fresh, agony. In the time of silence during which these thoughts had swayed her mind, Lord Sinclair had risen and gone out, hat in hand, glad to break away from the gloom of such a presence, and willing to leave his wife the opportunity he knew she craved of an uninterrupted conversation with the mournful man, who was now the "Master of Bouverie," for such by will of his niece was Dr. Paul Quintilian. "Have you been alone ever since you lost her?" asked Lady Edith, firmly. "No, madam, no! a faithful friend of hers and mine, has shared my pillow of thorns, my cup of tears, until to-day. He, too, is grievously shaken ; I speak -of Mr. Clavering, madam, God's   232      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.  truest man. But oh, in the very nature of things, his grief is a not measurable with mine 1" "Certainly not, he was a friend merely; you a near relative,  i and her protector."                       i "A friend, and lover, madam, he was bot ;l not an accepted one, it is true, but it is just possible that in the end she might - have married him. Some remarks in her diary, kept faithfully in the last twelvemonth, perhaps before-but if so providentially  i destroyed-seem to point to a possibility of this nature. She looked !: to him evidently as a certain stay should her fortitude to bear  alone give way against the ills of life. She esteemed him highly."' E "I never suspected this ; but her devotion to you was evidenced in every act, every expression even of her most expressive coun- tenance. I never saw such affection."              Y "She was an angel, madam, an angel! If she had any fault, it  was known only to the searcher of all hearts. Her few childish: defects fell away from her character as she grew up, as rain-drops from a tree after a storm. She shook them all off.

I was insensibly pre- pared through years for his early death. And Mrs. Bouverie, the friend of my orphaned childhood, that noblest, greatest woman, i my profession had given me also a prophetic insight into Iler sudden doom. Nor was it desirable that her sorrowful life shouldl be prolonged to melancholy age for her own sake ; those who  * " .     ^          !1; j'   THE HOUSEH:OLD OF BOUVERIE.       233 loved her best ought not to have wished for such a state of things. With meekness, with heartfelt submission, yet notwith- out great agony, I confess, I surrendered these well beloved ones to the shadows of the grave ; but the trampled worm will turn. I understand now about the ewe lamb. Yes, madam, yes, I had suffered enough. Justice demanded respite." She could not answer him-she had no words wherewith to- stem such a bitter current-the flood-gates had been loosed, and he poured out freely now the waters of his grief. "Vigorous, healthful, firmly organized, full of capacity of every kind, of vitality which promised a far limit to her life- young enough to have shaken off her sorrow, and formed new ties, contented if not happy, and beloved by all who knew her, why should she have been cut off? Why selected for such a death, unless, indeed, to carry out that:dark mystery of atone- ment so inexplicable to me?" "Dr. Quintilian, I too murmured once, when Everard, my only brother, in the pride of his noble manhood, was stricken down; but I acknowledge now, blindly and unquestioningly, the. wisdom of my God,." The instance she had given seemed to soften him-the similarity of their doom seemed to strike him for the first time. "Aye, madam, that too was supremely awful, mysterious, fore-ordained, we cannot doubt ; I remember the impression it made upon me at the time. Yet there seems to have been no necessity for atonement there." "Oh, banish such a thought! I -see how it haunts you.

"God forbid you should 1 It was very strange, very  mysterious. It was in Governor Staunton's service that she met her death. In early years his brother, Frederick, was thought to have fallen by her grandfather's hand. This much of his sin is probably loosened to Erastus Bouverie."            I It seemed a perfect hallucination to Lady Sinclair, such an X idea I But what could she, a woman accustomed only to the   I practical,the real, unlearned in logic, profound only in faith and I feeling-what objections could she offer to such a dark convice- t tion?  She could but murmur again of submission and the love of God.  He went on passionately.    "Madam, I made too much an idol of her, even from the first, I know  it now. I took her into my very heart of hearts, from ' that first hour when I saw her (and my soul told me it was she ;l I sought) crouching beneath the old stone gate, at Taunton  ! Tower, thinking, sternly thinking, madam (I had it later from t! her own truthful lips), of suicide. Do not think the worse of her for that, nor deem  it impossible that she, a child of scarcely twelve years of age, should entertain such a notion. In those poetic natures, madam, troubles press to a rapid conclusion, and   THE HOUSEHOLD OP BOUVEilE.        235 before reason triumphs, the wish to fly from sorrow, to the ideal mind is almost irresistible. I am sorry, to say it; but I believe there is a frequent tendency to self-immolation in such beings, that they fight with all their days. "But all good gifts have their compensating ills. I never shall forget the impression made on my mind by the little childish form, as it rose from beneath the shadow of the column, with an elfin suddenness, and stood before me earnest, motionless. "She was small and slight then, even for her age, though she grew up rapidly afterward, and strong, in our free, republican air; but even then, there was the wonderful presence, which she always retained. The wild September gale was blowing about her careless, curling hair, bare to the sun. The great blue eyes looked out on me, so full of grief and mournful purpose, that they thrilled me with their spiritual depth. ;She wore over her black dress, so as to shelter her bare, childish neck and arms, a scarlet shawl of Shetland wool, which she drew closely round her as she stood watching for me to speak. I never saw such reti- cence and grace in any child. I took her to my heart from that hour, madam, with Jasper's self, and wore her to the last proudly -my precious jewel-as the chief adornment of my life. She came to Bouverie. It was like turning a spring into a stagnant pool, freshening its dead waters into life and health. She revived us all. We loved her passing well, and how she repaid us, God knows alone I I am weak to speak so much of my own sensations to you, almost a stranger ; but bear with me, I find it a relief.

I trust I yet may live to say with sincerity, 'Though he slay me, will I not forsake him.' But, darling, your fate was bitter." He hid his face in his hands; he wept aloud, with the anguish   j of a child.                    . : When he was quieted, Lady Edith found herself nerved by the emotion of the moment, to approach him, and lay her halnd upon    i his arm, and speak some heartfelt words, in a voice broken with   , feeling.                              , "She has rejoined those she loved," she said. "She is spared  g the bitterness of pain, of grief, of change, of wearing age. Her  ! sufferings were but for a moment ; her joy will be eternal I You, too, will join her when this life is over.  God's holy will be   ' done."                                She doubted afterward whether he heeded or understood her,    : he was so rapt, and his lips were moving silently. Soon lifting   : up his voice to God, as if unconscious of any other presence, Dr. Quintilian prayed aloud, for the first time since Lilian's death.  ! Let us -hope that the balm of peace fell over his bruised an.   { broken heart. Let us trust that his cry of anguish, divested of    all human infirmities, ascended to the throne of the Most High,   : where the record of his saintly life was kept, and found its merci- i: ful recognition through the medium of Christ the Saviou.  NOTE.--The writer of these last chapters would here remark, that when- i ever the mental reflections of Mrs. Quintilian have been introduced into this record, her diary, kept faithfully during the last twelve months of her: life, has been referred to as authority. 1'   THE HOIJSEHOLD OF BOUU Vile.      237 CHAPTER YIII.. WHEN Lady Edith was alone that night with Bianca, who came to officiate in her chamber, and at her undressing, she drew from her the mournful details of a disaster, of which she had only heard the outlines. She knew that she could obtain such a comr plete recital of the occurrence, and what preceded it, as Bianca could give her, from no other source. She recognized, too, in her intercourse with this faithful servant, the position of friend and confidant, which she had gained by her long and honorable services, and disinterested devotion, and treated her as she could have done no other-menial.  Bianca becan with unconscious artistic skill to trace the tissue of Lilian's fate, from the time of the vision in the rotunda, to the moment of its consummation. "She never seemed herself entirely after that evening, my lady," said the attached creature. "Her cheerfulness forsook her. She never sang another note, nor opened another book to read, after that night; but it was walk, walk, write, write, all the time. I always noticed, my lady, that those were the signs of misery in our house. I loved to hear the piano going, and see the needles at work-then I knew all was well with our ladies. She spoke to me several times about that vision in the rotunda, her 'terror,' as she .called it, and the way it had 'entered into her life, as she expressed it, and 'Rose,' her own little maid, who always slept in her room after Mr. Jasper's death, and was the same as one of the family, seeing that her sister married our   238      THE IOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. idiot-that wretched, wretched creature, the cause of all this sorrow, Rose said she often heard her weeping and pray- ing in the night, and that she couldn't help thinking that some- thing was weighing heavy on her mind. Once when she was speaking to me about her ' terror,' Miss Lilian said- ' Bianca, the books must be removed, or I must give them up ; I never, never, can set my foot in that dreadful place again ; I used to pray to see my grandfather, yet when he came, I was afraid to meet him. What a coward that apparition has made of me, to be sure. Yet this is all wrong, perhaps ; Christ's disci- ples were not made fearful when he came among them after death. Was not this meant as a lesson to reconcile mortals to spiritual appearance?  Yet, after all, there was, of course, a wide differ- ence. He shaped every sentiment to beauty and to love. He was divine in flesh as out of flesh.' Then she mused. "' Remember how Saul was stricken when he saw Samuel,' I said, 'it is human nature, Miss Lilian, every one feels so. But you saw nothing after all, nothing but that little dull blue flame that might have been a gas-damp, such as they find in wells, or maybe a  stray "Will-o'-the-Wisp," who knows?'  "' Oh! Bianca, it was the same flame that quivered over the crucible on the night Fabius drew my blood. I never saw such a light before nor since, until that evening in the library. It was not  transparent; but dull and opaque, as if it had substance,' and she shuddered visibly. 'I made my compact, then, I  suppose,' " she said, 'and I must abide by it. But to think, to think that I I should ever be afraid of him, living or dead-Sealed with blood!' I she whispered, then stopped again, 'I have had so many happy days in that rotunda,' she went on, 'I cannot bear to give it up.  It seems ungrateful. Why, after all, why should J be afraid of   THE HOUSEEHOLD OF BOUEVRItICE.      239 his spiritual presence?- He never would harm me in any shape, tI!  and to speak to me, might comfort him. I fainted too soon, or I am sure I should have seen him. Hie is there, Bianca, he is there, waiting for me to come ; and I cannot go, I am such a coward, No, I never, never, can set my foot there again.' She sat shak- ing her head slowly a long time in a melancholy, dreamy sort of X  way. "'Don't fret about it any more, dear,' I said, 'Oh 1I if Bishop Clare were only living I how glad I should be.' "'Dear, dear old man, I wish he were, if indeed it be not sinful to wish a saint like him again an earthly bondsman, and what, after all, could he do in a case like this?' "' Exorcise the spirit,' I answered boldly, 'and that's what others could do, as well as he, if you could only think so, andlet them try. Holy water is holy water in any anointed hands, and there are still consecrated priests left.' "She turned upon me as quick as lightning; it was a way she had sometimes. "'Father Conrad, for instance, Bianca,' she said, laughing. Then growing suddenly serious again, her cheek flushed slightly. I saw she had not liked my suggestion. "' If it pleases him to return to his own house,' she said in a low, grave voice, 'it would ill become me, his child, to cast him forth, even in spirit, if, indeed, such a thing could be done by -a mortal hand. But oh I Bianca, do you think that priest or bishop, or pope himself could ever make him quail in any shape? Do you know so little of that fiery heart?' "She looked at me with flashing eyes and haughty smile, and for one moment I saw the resemblance I never could bear to see-the likeness that seemed to strike out, so to speak (for she had no   240      THE HOUSEHOLD OF IOUVERIE. feature of his)--to the master, and always blinded me almost, like a glare of sheet li'llllting; I never saw it half so strolng before."                            : "She must have loved him very much, Bianca, very tenderly." "Madam, madam, that was one of the strangest thingrs my   . life has shown to me, the blind idolatry of that child for her grandfather; I lie in bed and think of it at night till my head swims. What was the tie between them that seemed to reach    i over the grave, that grave that snaps all others? Does God yoke together a good and bad spirit from the first so that one may save the other? Or does he give the evil sometimes power to drag down the pure? It- is very mysterious, Lady Edith, very mysterious." ."                        :1 "I am sorry such fancies enter your brain, Bianca," was the J calm reply. "The love of Lilian for Mr. Bouverie was a natural :  and noble trait in her character, I think ; but I cannot believe in :- any undue influence, now if ever."  "See, he commands her still," persisted Bianca ; "he called  : her, and she went 1"And she theni told Lady Edith the vision of the thrilling voice, and the thrice repeated name, as Lilian had related it." "As for Mister Erastus," proceeded the fluent dame, "I I think-in justice to the name he ought to be exorcised still, and laid at rest--for who knows, Lady Edith, but he may become   i one of those regular rapping spirits, that are going the rounds now, making shows of themselves, and so disgrace the family?  i Lady Edith looked in surprise on one so blinded by her pre- Ii judices and fidelity, that she could imagine further disgrace possible, in the case she referred to Erastus Bouverie had not  spared the living-why should he spare the dead name?         THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       241 Tet she made no comment and bent her ear patiently to the  s :ative of Bianca, feeling convinced that it was only by humor- inog her peculiarities she could hope to learn the details of Lilian's last days. "The most of-us had our warnings, Lady Edith, as well as our dear child herself; even Pat McCoTmick's wife, a decent young creature she is, our laundress, and you may search the country #nd find no whiter linen than we keep at Bouverie, Lady Edith--it was a thing the mistress was mighty particular about, as well as -the master-even she had her signs of trouble, and she declares she saw Bishop Clare and Madam Bouverie walking statdy up the garden, in the full moon of, September, just before you came here first, aid says they disappeared in the shadow of the privet-lledges, just by the wicket-gate. The baby that was teorn a few weeks later had a wild, frightened look!"7-degitimately enough, thought Lady Edith, who had seen Patrick)--" and Biddy, herself, has never been the same woman since,'7 continued Bianca ; " as for Rose, her poor heart is broken within her-and even that wretched idiot has grown grey with trouble, and still sits by the fire of nights, rocking, just as his old dame used to do before him, crying and whining, and accusing the dead in their graves of tempting him to the, rash act that destroyed our peace." "Would it not be better to send him away, Bianca? It must be so trying to Dr. Quintilian to have him here 1" "He is a fixture at Bouverie, by her will, madam, and so in- deed are we all-even little Rose is provided for-Patrick has his cottage and garden in fee-simple, and I have a good income, my lady, and a home for life-if that could be any comfort after what has happened." VOL. II.- " \.   242      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. "You will find it so, Bianca, when the edge of your grief has worn off. Truly, this was very noble and considerate in Lilian!" "Then, Dr. Quintilian and the artists have all the rest, my lady, and the pictures are to be distributed equally between Mr. Clavering and Governor Staunton, and Dr. Paul; all but the family portraits-they remain at Bouverie -except one for Colonel de Courcy, the ' Aurora ;' and I heard Dr. Quintilian say, that at his death this house should stand 'in statu quo,' my lady--some new sort of statuary, I suppose, to be added to its adornments- for the benefit of sick artists, and he is to leave money enough to pay nurses and physicians forever, in trust. "It seemed to comfort him to draw up all the papers, with Mr. Clavering, and he called me and said; 'Bianca, if you survive me, you must promise to be matron of this establishment, and take Rose for your assistant ;' and he explained his plan to me." "Has he seen Patrick yet?"' "No, my lady; he has not been equal to it. I have been try- ing to persuade him to go to Governor Staunton again, just recovering a little from his illness, and who has written him a note begging him to come, with his own trembling hand ; but he can- not bring himself to pass the place; he shudders at the very thought. I wonder, my lady, if it is possible for a man, struck to the heart as he is, ever to recover? Now, if he were a woman one might hope!" "You think women can live through everything, Bianca." "Everything but one thing, madam, and that is ill-usage from the man they love. That kills a woman, or makes a stone of her, which is worse than death itself." "You had a kind husband, Bianca, I have been told?"   I          uTHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       243 I "Yes, yes indeed, my lady, very kind, when the chemistry worked right. But sometimes, after a hard day's labor over the jIl crucibles, half smothered with the ,glass mask he wore, and tired i of standing all the time, even Fabius would be fretful. But I never thwarted him then; a few comforting words do a great deal for a weary man. And now, my lady, since you have paved the way, as it seems, by your kindness in speaking of my poor Fabius, I must take the liberty to tell you my dream on the night, the very nighlt before that frightful disaster, and what seems to me to have been my warning besides." Willing to hear everything that bore upon the fate of Lilian, perhaps impressed, in spite of reason, by the superstitious awe that seemed to pervade the household in connection with the death of its mistress, Lady Edith inclined her ear patiently, if not with inte- rest, to the relation of Bianca's vision and-prophetic intimations. "I slept soundly, my lady, until about one o'clock in the m0orn- in, when I was wakened by the touch of cold fingers on my faie. I st rted up quite terrified; the room was dark, but I heard dis- tinctly, in the far corner, that little dry cough, 'of habit,' as Mrs. Bouverie called it, that belonged to Fabius, like a part of himself. I struck a match, with a trembling hand, and lit "my candle. I could see nothing. So after thinking and praying until nearly daylight, I blew it out again, and went to sleep; and then I dreamed. "It seemed to me that Fabius came to the bedside, wet and shivering, and very pale ;, but I never thought for a moment that he was dead. I had forgotten that in my dream. ! "'B1ianca,' he said, 'I want some dry clothes. I have been out in the rain so long that I am drenched, and the master is waiting for me to light the crucibles. Be quick!'   244      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. "I thought I tried to rise to serve him, but something seemed holding me down to the bed, that I could not conquer, and I was unable to get up. I could only lift my hands. 'Never mind,' he said, 'I see how it is. This is his day. Let no one stir from Bouverie until it is over. Above all, keep Miss Lilian at home, and let her wear the "gnome eye." No one can master that. Let her always wear it hereafter.' "Just then the spell seemed to leave me. I woke. I sat up in bed. The dawn was breaking through the window opposite me. I had left the shutters open, and there was nothing between me and daybreak but a thin, white curtain-nothing do I say? Oh, madam I I was wrong. Relieved against the window, dis- tinct as life ever showed him to me, between the transparent cur- tain and the pane, stood my husband, or his wraith rather. Dis- tinct but for a moment, then fading, fading, dying away, first into smoke, and  then into shadow, until he totally disappeared. These were my warnings, Lady Edith."  "It must have shocked you very much, even to be able to imagine such things," was the calm rejoinder.        t "Imagine! Oh, Lady Edith, may you never have such fan-  i cies. But the night wanes. Let me go on, I want to tell you, before I leave you, how it was that she went to her doom."  1 Again Lady Edith inclined an eager attention.  She hoped ; now to obtain, after so much that was useless and incredible, the : facts of the case, as she could expect to learn them from no one L else, or rather all those minute details of action that preceded the "disaster," as the papers had portrayed it. "You may suppose, Lady Edith, that after this I could rest no more. I   dressed myself as fast as I was able, and, after prayers, I felt more composed. It was not yet, sunrise, when I i      o   went out into the fresh air. I could still see the morning star. I walked out to the -fence, that divides the lawn from the stable- yard, to see the cows milkled. Patrick was feeding them; Biddy had the pail. "fWhy isn't Phelim at his post this morning?' I asked-for Pat was the gardener you know, my lady, and had nothing to do with gI this department rightfully. " ' He's had a chill,' said Patrick, 'and the fever's upon him   mighty hot this morning. It falls upon me to-day to see to both I. cows and horses.' "Just then a horseman galloped past and I recognized Gover- nor Staunton's man. "Don't you stop?' cried Patrick. "' No; I left my note at the house, Rose took it, and got my answer. I am wanted at home. The master lies ill to-day. "I knew that Governor Staunton had been ailing for a week, and that our doctor thought him threatened with typhoid fever. I knew he must be much worse to send to Bouverie, for his regular physician lived at Croften. The man galloped away, and I went straight to Miss Lilian. "I found her already dressed when I reached her chamber. Her bonnet and mantle were lying on a chair beside her, and she held a note in her hand, on which her eyes were fixed, musing-like. "' Give me some breakfast, Bianca, as soon as you can,' she said. 'Don't hurry the cook, make a cup of tea, and a bit ,of toast, and boil an egg yourself by. the dining-room fire for Dr. Quintil and me, for we should lose too much time to wait for Charity ; and Rose, go at once with this note to the doctor's room. Tell him, I shall be waiting for him  at the breakfasth table.'   246      THE HOUSEIIOLD OF BOUVERIE. "'Bianca,' she continued, 'Governor Staunton is quite ill- delirious, his wife fears, and as he calls incessantly for us, she writes to beg that we will come to him at once.' ' Here Rose came back--' Go and light the dining-room fire,' I said, 'and boil the water. I have a few words to say to Miss Lilian privately. Time enough for the eggs and tea when I get through.' "So Rose delivered her message, ' The doctor would be ready in ten minutes,' and went to do my bidding, and I stood up quite agitated before Miss Lilian, to plead like a lawyer, for a criminal t at the bar; to plead-but I did not know it then-against herself, for her own precious life. I tried to be as calm as possible in the beginning, and spoke carelessly, as was best with her in all cases for her courage seemed to rise, I always remarked, and her determination to do, just in proportion to the amount of a diffi- culty, presented. And so I said : 'You cannot go to-day, Miss Lilian, unless you take horses, for Phelim is sick in bed with a chill, and there is no one to drive you." "'My   horse is lame, you know,' she answered, 'and I can ride no other. So Patrick will have to drive us, Bianca. We will take the barouche. Do  give orders for me to that effect. Send James to tell him at once to harness the horses.' "  'There is no hurry about. your visit, Miss Lilian,' I said; ' Typhoid fever is a slow sickness-the governor will be no worse to-morrow than he is to-day, and then Phelim can drive you. He has only had a  chill, and will be better by morning.' I  know she thought me mighty meddlesome, by the way she looked, though she said nothing. I  turned to go, then went back, took hold of her hands and burst out a crying. She seemed somewhat shocked.  'Bianca, what ails you?' she asked, a   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       247 little coldly, I thought. My behavior must have seemed very "' Oh! Miss Lilian, dear, don't go to-day,' I said, as soon as I was able to speak. 'I have feelings about you leaving this house to-day, that I can't express. I have had such a strange dream.' "' Dofnt tell it to me, Bianca I' she said, raising her hand in a sort of warning way. 'God knows, I have had enough of visions lately. I will suffer them to govern me no longer ; and you too,dear dame, must throw off as much as you can the super- stition I have helped to fasten on you." "' Just this once, Miss Lilian, dear ; let me entreat you to stay, I   for my sake.' She sat down quite helplessly for a few minutes. 'I would do a great deal more than that for your sake, you well know, if it were reasonable; but what should I gain by. waiting? Pat is a good driver, Dr. Quintilian will be ;with me. The horses are reliable. What do you apprehend, Bianca? Why, I can drive myself, if needs be.' "'There is a running stream in the way, which you have to cross. I have had a warning about water, it seemed to me.' "' The road is changed since the railroad has been finished,' she said. ' We do not cross the stream any longer; besides, I am no witch,' she added, laughing, 'to fear running water; and after all, believe me, fate is fate, dear dame, elude it as we may.' "'Then grant me one favor: if you will go, wear your gnome- eye ring.' "What an idea! are you crazy, dear dame? Why it is big enough for an elephant's toe. How could I keep it on my little hands?' and she extended them laughingly. "' Then tie it on your bracelet,' I persisted. 'My Lilian, my   248      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEEIE. darling, you shall not go without it/.' I clasped her in my arms, I could not help it, Lady Edith, it was for the last time. All ceremony seemed brolken down at that moment, by the strong feeling stirring me likle a storm. She said no word, but I saw she was much affected. As soon as I withdrew my arms, she went upstairs for her 'gnome eye,' and tied it to her watch guard, and there it will ever remain. "When she was ready to go she said to me, as if she owed me some apology for opposing my wishes: "'(It seems to me, dear dame, a simple duty to obey the call of an ill neighbor; one, too, to whom we owe so much, so much more than the world knows of. I feel that I would lay down my life for Governor Staunton were it needful, and if the past could be thus wiped out, atoned for, Bianca.'  "The words seemed to choke her. I knew what she alluded to, though she was not conscious that I did. I had seen her reading her grandmother's diary in great anguish of mind, many times since Bishop Clare's death-when it fell into her hands, my lady; I knew , the books very well by sight, from the first, bound in gold and pu-  ple velvet, to the last, in black leather clasped with steel, just like I Mrs. Bouverie's own life, splendid in the beginning, sorrowful at I the close, Lady Edith. And in the last month I had seen her  I busy, pen in hand, marking and transcribing passages from these  books, as if she wished to print them on her brain. Sometimes I I thought to ask her to read portions to me; but again I thought i it best that she should suppose me ignorant of much that I knew they must contain, if possible for her to suppose so. We were happier as we were, never speaking about those terrible things ": never coming to any clearer understanding about the dark years I that were gone."                        I   THE HOUSEHOLD  OF BOUVERIE.     . 249 The rest of this sad story may be told with more brevity, and equal fidelity, by a less digressive narrator. The facts were simply these: Dr. and Mrs. Quintilian had set out to "Grosvenor," Governor Staunton's country residence, at which place he lay ill, at about seven o'clock in the morning. After passing the day beside him, finding that she could be of no immediate use, Mrs. Quintilian prepared to return to Bouverie alone. At the urgent request of Mrs. Staunton, Dr. Quintil agreed to watch that night by her husband, then nearing  the crisis of rapid typhus fever. Mr. C-lavering had offered to accompany Lilian home, but had been kindly yet steadily refused this privilege, and it was without the least anxiety on the part of any one, that she set out about four o'clock in the afternoon, to return to Bouverie, driven as before by Patrick McCormick. Indeed, Mrs. Quintilian herself under- stood the management of horses extremely well, and had driven frequently in that very equipage, to the church of Bouverie, when Dr. Quintil preferred to walk, and precede her, and servants were at liberty for the day. The horses, though spirited, were kindly, and accustomed to Pat, who would still steal a moment occasionally from his garden, to- aid in the stable duties, faithful to his old vocation of hostler. The carriage way, after keeping the main road steadily for a mile, diverged into a large wooded pasture belonging to the Dugannes, through which right of passage was granted to the neighborhood. In about half an hour after leaving Grosvenor, the ba7ouche emerged from this woodland--the gate of which Pat got down to unfasten-into the open road. "Do not shut the gate, Pat," said Lilian, "I hear the train coming, our best way is to back into the woods again."    250      THE HOUSEHOLD OF IBO UVERIE. He climbed up and seized the reins as if in haste to obey her. It was impossible to see the train or to judge correctly of its dis. tance, owing to the interposing wood, which obstructed both ear and eye. The horses, accustomed to meet it at the depot, near Bouverie, were not afraid of it, and their docility in " backing" from it had been proved before. The carriage stood safely enough on a slope of green sward, just above the road. Had Patrick, even in disobeying the more cautious order of his mistress, been content to remain quiet, all might have gone well.  But just as he had resumed his reins the  train swept in sight around the curve, not more than its own   ] length distant from the gate. Simultaneous!y with its appearance the mad idea seized Patrick that he could cross-the track before it reached him. He lashed his horses furiously. They sprang forward, and then stopped with their forefeet just grazing the iron rail (the hoof-prints were there afterward as proof of this) quivering with terror. All this was instantaneouis.  Lilian sprang to her feet, and seizing the  reins from  Patrick, drew  them to their haunches, assisted by him, perhaps, and turned their faces aside just as the engine reached them. The express shot by like an arrow. They were saved.

But the lady, what of her? Why cannot words do the work of light, and photograph her to the intellect as she stood there, grappling. with her fate, as i;  tetat brief instant fixed her forever on every beholding eye and sentient brain? The impression was electric, of course. Description fails to con- vey it, in any shape. Imagination even is at fault here-God's holy light alone can paint such pictures on its chosen surface, the wondrous human eye. Yet, with what words I have, let me endeavor to portray her as pale, slender, statue-like, erect ; her small hands straining at every nerve and muscle of her frame ; her large blue eyes, glaring like dying stars; her lips apart, white, horror-frozen; her nostrils narrowed to a line ; her face sharpened with its incredu- lous intensity-she stood, an image of beauty and terror, of courage and despair I But what of it at last? The fiery trial was but of one moment's duration. The cars had passedwithout touching even the manes of the horses, that waved beneath the very faces of the spectators. They were saved 1 Alas, the end was not yet I As the last car shot by, and the strength of hand and steed relaxed, the horses came to their feet heavily, swerved suddenly, and threw the carriage over on the rail, breaking away as they did so from every impediment of pole and harness, and plunging madly back again into the woods. The cry of joyful exultation had scarcely died away in the cars when the conductor stopped the train. The great chord of common brotherhood had been struck; )   252      TIIE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIIE. hundreds leaped out to return to the scene of trial--not one of these, perhaps, in the strong reIaction of feeling that had taken place, surmised the possible truth. Strong men were there, women, little children, all moved by generous sympathy, and most of them excited to grateful tears. It was as if every one had some great individual cause of thanks- giving to God. There was a murmur, then a great silence I Oh, it was pitiful I The truth I The driver was unhurt-the lady only had been killed. You knew this all the time? You knew that she would die? Of course you did-it was my intention that you should know it, from the time the tree fell, from the time the flame flitted around the Rotunda, and the thrilling voice thrice called her name, from the time the majestic picture fell scorched to cinders from the wall, struck by the fire of heaven. She knew it too, you may be sure, for she had fine instincts; or rather, she felt it whispering low in her nature, that prophetic voice of doom, and saw, as through a glass darkly, the sphere of her fate rolling on, gathering as it went, the power to crush her in,the end. So you see the great race (as they considered it) of Bouverie that came in with the Norman pirates, and crossed hands awith a Charlatan, was extinct at last I Some self-destroying eldment seemed infused in their very veins-some discord that jangled all the finer chords of life. Do you remember the Indian Princess in the Arabian 'iights, who fought with Genii in the air with swords of flame, and con- quered them at last, and fell to the earth herself in a shower of luminous ashes at the end? I think she must have been the pro- genitor of the Bouveries, and that the magical Thug blood   TIE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VERIE.       253 lingered in their veins. I think they inherited from her the dominant yet self-destroying element. You do not feel that this applies to Lilian? No, no, indeed; nor do I1 I never meant it should. She was the Iphigenia of her race, and died at Aulis, not to propitiate winds, but angry, unappeased and restless manes, perhaps. ,She was the sacrificial lamb bound from the first, it may be, to the horns of the altar.  The most lovely rose I ever saw sprang from a felon's grave- the most snowy lily from a pond of stagnant water-the sweetest grapes from the compound of inodorous matter and ashes, and, strips of moldy leather and poisonous, broken glass and bones, a skillful hand had made. These things are types of her. The poor wretch who was the immediate cause of her destruc- tion persisted in declaring that he saw his " dame" standing on the opposite side of the road, beckoning to him when he aimed to plunge across the track of the inexorable train. It was a spiteful thing even for a ghost to do, but after all allowances must be made for Patrick's fanciful mendacity, so dar- ing on occasions as to be almost sublime. After Mrs. Quintilian's death, there was no more talk of spirits at Bouverie's. They were satisfied, probably, with the result of their visitations, or  perhaps her presence among them sanctified their sins and quieted their roving propensities of being. These are all speculations of course, and no offence is meant to priest or layman, or spiritual medium. It is a beautiful thought, after all, to me, that a mortal may become so pure as to be permitted to assist in the great work of atonement. I have never seen a fairer corpse than Mrs. Quintilian made. I lookedr at her very earnestly as she lay in her coffin (as soon as   Tad "i .UWSEJOLD OF BOUVERglE I .    I could clear my eyes of their blinding tears), with'some view to this description. Her grave clothes were the same she wore habitually in life.-- the material black silk--soft and folded richly about her form, 'finished with ruffles of fine lace around her snowy throat and! waxen hands. The hair was braided back just as she always   E wore it, except where one great curl had broken away from Bianca's trembling fingers, and dropped across her motionless bosom. It was left there by the entreaty of "little Rose," until Mr. Clavering came and cut it away. Dr. Quintilian could think of nothing of the kind, then. He was down upon his face among the ashes. You have seen that sweet smile that comes to some faces after E a few hours' acquaintance with death, as if its conditions had been explained at last and accepted with loving confidence? This Irested early, and late, on hers.    ' You never wiuld have supposed she had died a death of pain or violence-yo;;ever would have believed her dead at all-  only sleeping ali dreaming pleasantly. The blow  that had killed her was hidden by her sweeping hair; I mean, of course,  the impression of the blow.  A mere dent, not bigger than a child'smnarble might have made, if pressed in wax, and but little  discolored, showed where the left temple had been fractured, and how   the great soul had been set free-suddenly, triumphantly, perhaps-no mortal man can know.  Could Bianca have been mistaken when she thought she dis- covered in the centre of this cavity the impression of the "gnome eye "  diamond and the double-headed eagles that supported it?  Could the adamantine jewel have done its part in driving home the bolt of fate, and sealing its decree, or was it a mere fancy?             ,   .   THE  IOUSEHOLD OF BOUVY ERE      255 In her pale fingers she held lightly a Cape Jasmin flower, with a few surrounding leaves. It was a strange coincidence that "Iittle Rose " should have selected this flower from the green- llouse above all others, for such a purpose, for Mr. Clavering had given her just such a one when they parted at the carriage steps at Grosvenor. Some conversation had preceded this, of course irrelevant here, even if known to the writer. He had said finally, however, as he avowed later- "If you hold this gardenia in your hand when I come to Bou- verie I shall believe that I am welcome. I shall be with you in two days." Alas I he came sooner than he had promised, and never knew, probably, that this was not the same flower he had given her (that flower trampled hours before to clay by the feet of the throng on the track, as they gathered around the. beautiful dead lady), or that it was only because poor "little Rose" knew how she loved them above all other blossoms, that she had searched    i the greenhouse for a Cape Jasmin to place in her nerveless hand. It was a touching incident, yet a crushing mockery, too, if it be well considered. She held the gardenia in her icy fingers now, as he had re- quested her to do, never more to be relinquished until it dropped to pieces in her coffin. She seemed to extend to him the signal of welcome he had craved; and yet, despite this token, he felt that his fate remained what his Maker had sealed it to him from the beginning-- DESOLATION I ,* ,    .            51,                                   BOOK NINTh.

MY husband has given me a -beautifully bound book to-day, headed with a learned sentence of Dr. Johnson's. He desires me to keep a diary on its blank pages, and to confide all my secrets to its bosom. He does this, he says, to prevent my forming female intimacies, the bane of married women, and to limit my confessions to Bishop Clare. He says I must write down daily, if possible, everything I feel, and think, and know ; and close my lips about details of my private life against all the world-and I have promised to obey him. He in turn has promised me never to read one syllable in my book without my permission, even should he find it lying open on my table, ever so invitingly, with the ink wet; and I know he will adhere strictly to his word, for Mister Bouverie is the soul of honor-the truest gentleman. !"am young to be married, only sixteen ; yet I feel quite at home in my new vocation. Motherless girls grow considerate so early, because there are none to consider for them. There were circumstances, too, that made it better for me to be married. Frederick false to me! Uncle Bouverie dead (so sud- denly), and I, all alone m that great gloomy house with Erastus, 259   260      THE LIOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. and with scarcely a friend or relation, that I know of, in the world!   , When the lawyer told me the domain was mine I was half in- credulous at first. I always thought Uncle Bouverie would leave it with the rest of his estate to his own nephew-and not to his wife's niece. I felt ashamed to take it. It did not seem morally mine; besides, my little income, I knew, would only have kept me alive in one corner of it. He thought to the last, though, I would marry Frederick. What a wretched time it was to be sure I Snow lying deep on the ground, Uncle Bouverie in his grave-all the servants gone except Dame McCormick and Bianca, and Aunt Furness; my own spirits much depressed-and Erastus, writing, writing all day long in the library, and never speaking to me at all, except -at meals. I would have been glad to have had even Eliza Jones for company; but after making up my mourning, she went away to sew for Mrs. Staunton. I had no idea we owed her half so much I I saw Mister Bouverie pay her two hundred dollars one morning in the breakfast-room, the morning before she left Bou- verie, and it seemed to me from what passed, that she wanted more. But I did not hear distinctly what was said ; I think she over- charged us greatly, or else there were unsettled wages of long stand- ing. It is better to be charitable, so I will try to believe the latter. It was in March that Bianca said to me, about six weeks after Uncle Bouverie's death: "What are you going to do, Miss Camilla? You cannot live here any longer all alone, with Mister Erastus ; people will talk. You had better go to- boarding-school for a few years." "Talk, about what, Bianca?"I asked. "a Oh, I know ;"I said, flushing up suddenly. "I know what you mean now." I saw it in the expression of her eye, I believe.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERE.        261. "Do you think any one could be so base and cruel as to try to injure me?"I added. ' Bishop Clare will be here soon, however; he is my guardian, you know, and he shall decide." "He ought to be here now," she said. "It is quite time he were coming back, and if he stays away much longer you must write to him. I am older than you, Miss Camilla, and ever since Felix behaved as he did, I have been up to men and their ways." I knew that her lover had abandoned her, and thought it natural she should be bitter; yet her speech sounded hard and coarse to me, impertinent^ even. "Erastus Bouverie is the soul of honor"' I said, a little indig- nantly; L he would never harm me, even in thought; besides, does he notice me, Bianca, any more than the tortoise-shell cat, or uncle's macaw? He goes and comes like a shadow-his heart is in his books and' writings. Do you think an elegant, dis- tinguished man like him would look at a little, obscure country girl for a wife? And what else, Bianca, would he or any other man dare to think of, in. my case?" I began to cry, she seemed annoyed; but she persisted that I ought to go to school. "I do not want to go to school, Bianca," I said, through my tears. "I have no taste for learning, I never had:" ".Nor -shall you go, Camilla," said Mr. Bouverie, stepping quickly into the room; "not at least if I can help it ;" and placing his arm around me, he drew me tenderly to his breast- oh, now I trembled I It was the first time he had ever touched more than the tips of my fingers, or shown me even commonM attention. "Stay at home and be my own sweet little wife, and I will be your schoolmaster!"   262      TIE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. Then he kissed my forehead, and from that time I loved him. I had never thought of such a thingc before-nor had he probably; but on overhearing Bianca, all the forlornness of my situation had pressed upon him, and it was a part of his gracious charity to marry me-his-noble generosity I All regret for Frederick and his treachery vanished from that time, and I was perfectly happy-so we were married in May- and this is my sixteenth birth-day, the first of June; Bishop Clare has gone to Carolina. I wish I could feel more real sorrow for Uncle Bouverie. I reproach myself all the time for levity and hardness of heart. I was the only creature he loved, except his wife, to whom he had been devoted. He was kind, too, to my dear mother as long as she lived, and to little beautiful golden-haired brother Charlie. For these things I tried to love him; but Bishop Clare knows how hard I found the struggle I There was something about him that terrified, that repelled me. He was so harsh, so forbidding, so hideous too I I know it was sinful to care for this ; but that bristling hair, that sharp, terrible eye-those long pointed hooking fingers, with which the servants say, he used to extract the guinea-worm, winding it out in spools like a skein of yellow silk, from the legs of slaves, when he bought them  on the African coast-all these repelled me. Hush I this is only a whisper; but it chilled my marrow when I heard it. The family pride would recoil from the possi- bility of a " slave-trader ' among them. Black and terrible name that all abhor! Besides, he never 1    !          THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       263 would be served by negroes--he seemed to loathe them. Would not this in itself almost disprove the accusation brought against him?  It was only because Aunt Furness was my mother's v favorite servant, that he would sufferme to have her brought here, when she had her long and dangerous illness. But he found her a great comfort in his kitchen, when Polly McCormick had other duties to perform. Erastus inherits this prejudice, the only inheritance, I hope, that he receives from Uncle Bouverie personally. What a con- trast there was, to be sure, between them It Mr. Bouverie's father, a younger son, who died early, was said to have been very hand- some, as well as others of the name in England-one of these was a Madam Ambrose, I believe. I hope he will take me there after a while. I would so love to travel. How would I appear among allothose grand people? Partial friends tell me that I am handsome ; he says beautiful, in his blind admiration of his wife. I think, and so declares my mirror, well-looking, to say the very least. Self-educated, though I almost ignorant I except of French and music, all Miss La Serre understood I Uncle Bouverie never sent me to school as he should have done, I think, and that girl was intolerable in the house. I learned more at General Staun- ton's than anywhere else, from the elegant conversation at his table. But this is a history I am writing, not a diary. So much for a beginning! My husband has brought home at last his little ward, and re- commended him to my kindness. The holidays have-commenced, and I shall have him all to myself until the first of September.   264      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. "Be kind to him if you can, Camilla, and see that he wears clean linen and learns his lessons, for my sale,'"Mr. Bouverie said, before he brought him into my chamber, kissing me fondly as he spoke. "But, dearest, he is a morose creature-he will never interest you, I know." "Oh, of course, I will be kind to him, my Erastus," I replied; "not only for your sake, but his own, and even mine; for, is he not, like me, an orphan, and alone?  Yet alone with such a difference, a helpless little one, with no great strong arm of love to shelter him."  He smiled, and withdrawing a moment, returned leading in the child, who hung back from his hand unwillingly, and seemed dis- concerted when I kissed him. He does seem an odd, reserved little fellow I Paul is between eight and nine years, well grown for his age, a large, not unhandsome child; but certainly not attractive. He has been motherless so long that he has learned to be reserved and cautious like an old man. He never laughs or chatters idly as most children do of his age ; but stares at every- thing until his eyes haunt one. His gravity is almost a reproval to my nonsensical gaiety. We have been looking over his ward- robe together. It is literally a " thing of shreds and tatters," with the exception of the decent suit he wears ; such an array of odd socks, and little sleeveless shirts, all slit and rent in every direction, I never saw before. Bianca held up her hands in holy horror, but I gave way to peal after peal of laughter, much to his discomfiture. "Never mind, Paul," I said,'" we shall soon have everything set to rights, and I will make you a set of shirts with my own hands, and ruffle the collars.7? His face cleared up immediately, and he came behind me, and put his hand timidly on my shoulder, leaning over.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       265 "I shall like them all the better for that,' he said low, " you must get me some handkerchiefs, too, when Mr. Bouverie has some money of mine again; some handkerchiefs with tigers on them like Joe Gale's.' I am glad he knows he is independent; it will make him so much happier.- Poor little motherless fellow I he has never known common comfort, that is plain ; but he is spoken of as a "s very learned child," as one might say, a " learned pig," a sort of phe- nomenon, and is quite a Greek scholar already. "Oh, Paul," I said to him a few days ago, as he stood staring at me silently while I played cup and ball, until his observation became a positive annoyance, "I wish you knew how to play I I wish you were even a bad child, I would love you a thousand times better, I am sure!"I spoke in a tone of absolute fretfulness, I am afraid. "Then I will try to be bad," he 'said, demurely ; "I want you to like me, Camilla."  Terrified at the possible consequences of this foolish speech, I hastily caught him around the neck, and tried at once to remove the impression I had created. "No indeed, Paul," I cried, "I was only talking wildly ; I do like you just as you are, because you are so good, so docile, so little troublesome ; and if you continue to be a dear boy, I shall love you better and better every day." "You remind me,' he said, quietly disengaging himself from my arms, and standing before me with his hands behind him like a philosopher cut short, "of one of .Esop's fables I have been translating lately, about a traveller and a satyr ; would you like to hear it, Camilla?"  On receiving my affirmative answer, he VOL. I,.-12                         '   O 2bb      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. related to me in very oracular style the famous " blow hot" and "blow cold" story that I had read myself a dozen times in my childhood; but I confess without an application always. "Now you must be one thing or the other to me, Camilla," he said, "'from the word ' go,' both you can never be." His cheek flushed slightly, he was evidently in thorough earnest, and I own I was almost frightened at the weird wisdom of this speech; but I could find no better answer than putting back his soft, bushy hair and kissing his larige, clear forehead. This seemed to satisfy him perfectly of my intentions. Another queer scene with little Paul, whose quaint ways divert and mystify me all the time. During Mr. Bouverie's absence of a week, I have nothing else to amuse me nor to write about. He has called me familiarly "Camillae" until now; but fearing that Mr. Bouverie might not like the appellation, or rather that it might make me appear too childish in his sight, I said to him recently: "Paul, you are a little fellow, and I am your guardian's wife. Don't you think it would sound better if you were to add a han- dle to my name, as common folks say? 'Call me 'Cousin CamillaJ or 'Aunt Camille,a whichever you prefer ; which shall it be, Quintil?"' "Neither," he replied, manfully, " for you are neither of those things to me, and I do not like to tell stories ; but I will call you' madam,' if you choose, as you are a ' madam ; " and some- thing like a sneer wreathed his childish lips. {"A foolish little madam, you think, Paul!"I rejoined, half in pique, half in playfulness. %    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       267 "Why that is the very name for you," he said, brightening with the thought. "' Little Madam 1' I will call you so ; but I will not put in the foolish," he added, gravely, " for, perhaps, you will change after a while and grow wiser." . He spoke very seriously, sorrowfully almost, and I was quite provoked for a moment to be set down in this fashion, by such a mere babe and suckling. I was glad of the opportunity presented to me of snubbing him by noticing a streak of molasses on his cheek. "Go wash your face, Paul," I said ; "it is dirty!" He walked gravely to the glass and surveyed the stain. ' Looking-glasses are useful things, after all," he said; 6 they tell the truth-see ' Little Madam,' how you are mistaken I my face is not dirty, only soiled; food is not dirt-if it were, we shuald all starve."  He turned and smiled at me in his peculiar way, half mocking, half affectionate. "Yet, as you bid me," he added, "I will wash it off; but isn't it a pity to waste what would keep a bee alive a whole day!" Is this brat a humorist? He has brought out of his funny little trunk the oddest present for me! It is a Medusa's head admirably carved in alabaster, and was broken from the side of a vase by accident, and given to him by a lady, at whose house he made a visit with Mr. Bouverie, He considers it a priceless treasure. There is a vague horror to me in the face that is almost insupportable. The snaky hair, the sightless, glaring eyes, are so mysteriously dreadful. He says   268      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. it will answer for a paper weight. No, Paul, I will lay it away out of sight forever. Au,6gust.

"You are familiar with that, it is easy too," he said, putting the book quietly. back in its place. "Read me a little now from Montesquieu." Again, I read without an error, either in pronunciation or em- phasis, a chapter from "L'Esprit des Lois." Even his fastidious. sense of right was satisfied. "You understand French, Camilla, evidently," he said; " but. that is about all'that you do know. You are like a man who has commenced his dinner on pound-cake. Substantials will be nn- savory to you now ; yet, you must take them for your health's sake, child."

"Do you know why you talk thus?" he said; " yours is the grammar of routine, merely; you can no more give a reason for your words than the grey macaw yonder." "Thank you," I said, courtesying demurely. "It is astonishing, after all," he said, " where your gifts come from--for you certainly are gifted-with such poor watery blood in your veins!"He half murmured these words. "Poor blood I Why, my blood is as red as rubies, and as rich as cream, when I cut my finger last week " "Nonsense, Camilla ; what a; literalist you are, to be sure," he interrupted, getting up and walking the room, with a stormy face, and glaring at me terribly. I dropped my head on my bosom. "I am talking of your Byrne blood;" he said, sharply; " of your pedigree/ "I am no race-horse," I said, "Mr. Bouverie, to be estimated by pedigree ;7"I spoke proudly. He smiled as -if he could not help it ;' but in an irritating way. "True, true-and yet that dilating, delicate nostril-that lofty carriage of the head, that small, well set ear, do remind me irre- sistibly all the time of an Arab courser," he said, stopping and looking at me admiringly. "And those well-turned hands, with their slender curling tips and rosy nails-what right have you to such tokens of noble blood, Camilla? None at all; you are a rank usurper, little one." He approached me, and threw his arm around me. "There was no blood better than my father's," I said, under- standing him well, at last, and I knew my eye flashed as I spoke. o   270      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUV VEIrE. "It was pure Virginia blood, and my mother's was as good'; but his was sanctified, when he poured it out freely for his country, on the field of Yorktown." "Talking politics I eh, Camilla I Do you know, child, there is just one shade of difference between your knowledge on such subjects and that of the tortoise-shell cat who sits yonder in the corner washing her face with her paws? Look at her, Camilla, witness her humility." "' I can not see, Erastus,? I said, disengaging myself from his embrace, " how it elevates you to try and degrade the wife of your bosom." And I drew myself up with a stately air. "She has you there," cried Paul Quintilian, suddenly lifting his head from the book of algebra, where he had held it closely supported until now,' by his hands, and slipping his feet from the rungs of the chair, so as to undouble himself again. "Little Madam plumped you that time, past your middle man clean into taw, and you are nowheres!"He snapped his fingers. What a look the boy received. Had he met it full, it must have blighted him; as it was, I stood trembling for the consequences of this singular triumphant outhreak in my favor, I must confess. '"Paul Quintilian," said Mr. Bouverie, at last, in an accent of suppressed rage, and indicating his command with his long-point- ing finger, while his cheek grew white and his lip trembled. "Leave this library, and return to it no more, until you are summoned, sir." The child scrambled down from his chair and walked quickly out, clasping his book to his breast, yet at the door he turned and darted a sympathizing look at me, a furious one at him, un- noticed by Mr. Bouverie. As he passed out, I threw my arms around Erastus. "He is a poor little orphan," I said, do not /   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVELKME.      271 be severe," and I buried my face in his breast. "God gave him to us, Erastus." ( I must teach him manners love, you know, as a part of my duty." I felt his kisses on my hair. When I looked up every trace of excitement had rolled from his features as a cloud from clear sunshine. Again I met his beautiful radiant smile. "You are so sweet," he said, "so angelic, who could resist you? Do you know, Camilla, that I have never loved any woman before? I have tried but never could succeed, and now comes a little wood nymph, and prostrates all my faculties to her will; but you," he continued, "young as you are, have had your own little experiences of the heart already?" I blushed, and hung down my head. "No," he said, "I am not going to probe the old wound-do not be afraid-he was a scoundrel, let him go. Love vanishes with respect, we all know; I am not afraid of the future." Something called me away not long after this ; I went into the pantry to see Bianca, she was not there; but Paul, in his accustomed attitude, with his feet wrapped round the rungs- of his chair, his elbows on the table, his bushy head supported in his hands, was deep again in his algebra. He looked up, however, as soon as I entered, with a quick flash, of the eye, that showed his ready recurrence to the little scene in which he had so ingloriously enacted the part of a defeated champion. The lamp had been lit and threw its ruddy glare over his angry little face, and suddenly clenched hands. "He is as cross as a crab," he said, " and I hate him, and so does Bianca, that is one comfort, and so will you, Little Madam, some day, and that is another." (Oh I Paul, Paul I surely you are not speaking of your vene-   272      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUEVKKIE. rated guardian, of my idolized husband in such words. Do you know that if I could feel thus my sin would be too great for for. giveness?"  "How could you help it," he said, " if he riled you all the time?" "But he never thought of such a thing, he was only jesting, and you, dear Paul, were wrong to be so rude, so outrageous almost. I am sorry to apply such terms to you ; but they are truthful words, dear Paul, and you must try and be sorry that you have offended Mr. Bouverie." "I am sorry," he said, after a moment's hesitation, " if, if, it makes you sorry, Little Madam ;" and he laid his head on the table and began to cry heartily. I went up to him and kissed him softly, and put my arms closely round the poor motherless onec Oh! Charlie, Charlie I perhaps he has been given to me in place of you, my lovely little brother.

He is the last of a family of six, with one exception. His brother, twelve years older, is also a ward of Mr. Bouverie's; but is being educated in Leyden, where some of his connections live. He is said to be a remarkably handsome and promising youth, and his letters to Paul are marked with tenderness and dignity, yet what can he do to comfort his little brother, so far away? that great sea lying between them, almost like death itself?   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       273 September. Three months have scarcely elapsed since my marriage, and yet already a great sorrow has fallen upon me. What should I do if I had not the comfort of these faithful pages? To whom should I apply for counsel or for sympathy? I often receive both as from foreign sources as I write, it seems to me I am answered. During my husband's brief absence, I received a letter from Eliza Jones, yritten on her death-bed. She inclosed all of *Frederick Staunton's letters, long intercepted. She tells me a tale that I cannot, will not believe about that ring she wore, and declared he gave her. No, my noble husband never stooped to treachery like this I ?-:*t   8And yet she says that it was because she must have been an ever-present reproach to him, that he refused to let me keep her as my maid-the most efficient, certainly, I could have procured. My engagement with Frederick Staunton was a childish affair; yet I should have fulfilled it to the letter, but for his long silence, and the baseness he was guilty of in presenting the ring I gave him to Eliza Jones. She :sends it back to me, declaring that she stole it from him while he slept, at-my husband's instigation, on. the last night of his stay at Bouverie, a year ago I I had no idea then that Erastus was thinking of me, mere child that I was ; I do not believe it yet. Our love was sudden ; our engagement, almost immediately, owing to circumstances, succeeded by our marriage. Frederick's perfidy cost me few lasting pangs; for noble and handsome as he seemed, how could he compare for a moment to the brilliant, fascinating man, who deigned to ask my hand? He had left the way open certainly by his carelessness fig his rival's success. 12*   274      TIE IIOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.. Had he been true, I should have been faithful to him; and yet it seems it was no fault of his, after all. Here are his letters, indisputable proofs of his constancy before me-here my ring-- here the acknowledgment of a dying woman I There is something very black about this matter ; but I discard the thought that my husband ever stooped to such a step. [No 1 Eliza Jones is revenging herself, terribly indeed, for the slight he put upon her, by refusing to let her, continue in my service. He threatened her, she said, and she was afraid to speak ; " but the dead are beyond the power of the living," she added, " and I dare disclose all now." Then begging me for pardon, she concludes this dying confession of sin, of shame, of treachery I I forgive you, poor Eliza, from the bottom of my heart, as I hope to be forgive, but I will not suffer myself to refer this mat- ter to my husband in any way. I will not annoy him now on the subject at all. I will put the letters aside, and the ring, and at some future time he shall see them, and receive my assurances of continued confidence and respect. He will believe me then; he might doubt me now and be troubled. I am determined to dis- card this matter from all further thought or consideration. My .husband returns to-morrow. Mr. Bouverie has come, so bright, so noble, so affectionate I His love for me seems to increase. I thought that men grew colder as time flew. I am strangely constituted; I fear. There is a fierceness in his passion that almost terrifies me sometimes, and chills me even. I do not think my temperament is sufficiently high strung and lofty to match with his. He asks   THME HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVaEIE.        275 me sometimes if I would be willing to jump from a cliff with him if he wished it, and when I falter for a reply, he says, " Camilla, no woman;- that loves truly would hesitate for an answer to such a question." And yet I think he loves his life as well as any one else. I believe some day I will say " yes," just to see what he would do. But it would displease him perhaps were he to read my object, which he would be very sure to do, he is so penetrating. I have an instinctive feeling that he would never forgive me, if I offended him even once. Erastus does not like little Paul, that is plain. I am sorry for this; the child seems fond of him of late, and I am growing into a real attachment for the good, earnest little fellow. He is teaching me arithmetic I Does this not seem queer, with -all my various reading, and some little accomplishment, I never under- stood the rule of three until this child made it plain to me? What a poor thing a woman's education is at best I No wonder the men fancy themselves so superior I In return I teach Paul the piano ; and he thrums several hum-drum tunes, to his own great delight, and Mr. Bouverie's infinite annoyance. That is the one thing in which Erastus is deficient-he has no ear for music. He is not ashamed to acknowledge this, and therefore I was ill-prepared for his -angry scowl, when I quoted, playfully I am sure, Shakspeare's celdbrated lines : " The man that has no music in his soul, Nordis not moved with concord of sweet sounds, Is fit for treason, stratagem and spoils, And his affection dark as Erebus- Let no such man be trusted!"  276      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. Paul goes to school in our neighborhood.  He sleeps in Bianca's room  in the wing, and is well cared for. Dame McCormick, too, is tolerably kind to him. Poor thing, her son has run off, and gone to sea, and she is in great distress. She has no other child to protect her in her old age. I cheer her, however, as well as I can, by holding out the hope that he will yet return. I am giving up my music, because Erastus dislikes it so much, and yet I used to be said to have a sweet voice. Paul's practisings are also hushed, in accordance with what I con- sider my duty to my husband. Mr. Bouverie is of opinion that " music is only the most endur- able of disagreeable noises." It certainly is a small sacrifice to close a piano, and yet-and yet-I have been spoiled, I fear! October. I was crimping a frill for Paul the other day, when Mr. Bou- verie came in, and suddenly plucking it from my fingers, threw it into the fire. He did not seem  excited-only cold and dis- pleased. "I disapprove of such frippery for a boy," he said, calmly, "and, Camilla, what can you see in that lumpy child to interest you up to the point- of giving him almost half of your time? You are always at work for him!" "He is a good child," I replied, " and you requested me, when you brought him here, to be kind to him. It is not in my nature to treat liim otherwise: than kindly." The tears, in spite of myself, rolled down my cheeks. He surveyed me with a mocking smile.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       2" "You are laying up treasures in heaven, eh.! Camilla ?" he observed, " by attention to the orphan and widowed" (alluding to Dame McCormiclk, whose recent affliction had taken me to see her several times), " and all that sort of thing. We shall have you a- member of the missionary society next, making flannels for the Feejee children, whose luxury it is to go naked." "Mr. Bouverie, you are unjust to me," I said. "I do all I can to please you;" adding playfully, " a woman's work-basket is her castle, I believe, in most cases, and she does what she will within its walls., " A woman I Why you are a mere child, Camilla. It is my duty to train you in the way you. shall go, and I'mean to fulfill it." I shrank before the glance he bent on me (he has a terrible eye, certainly, though I never noticed it before we were mar ried), and I conquered the reply that rose to my lips. I shall crimp- no more frills for little Paul l He is sorry for his conduct, I think, though he has never said so. He has brought me a beautiful bracelet and a book for Paul. The child is in raptures. It is Mr. Day's pleasant work, t' Sanford and Merton."  I think Paul's character is so much like Sanford's that I mentioned it to 'Mr. Bouverie, but he quite scouted the idea, and seemed impatient that I should spend my timne reading a child's story. Hie has given me a terribly difficult book on mental philosophy to study. I am sure I cannot make head or tail of it, and what does it signify, after all ?  There is a chapter on the "law of motives," that has almost set me crazy. If I were a queen, I 278      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE, would shut up the man that wrote this book, in a lunatic asyium for life, and so benefit mankind. Mr. Bouverie examined me when he returned from Croften (I knew he would), and I did not know one word of my lesson. "You have not the intellect I thought you had, Camilla," he said, gravely; "but of course you are not accountable for this.' I looked up into his face and laughed outright; he, too, smiled. "Little trifler i" he said fondly, taking my face in his hands, and kissing me repeatedly ; "yet sweeter thus, I believe," he added. "See what I have brought my idle scholar as a reward for disobedience," and he held up before me a dear, delightful book -a sort of novel, written in poetry, called "Marmion," by a new English poet, Walter Scott. I have devoured it literally. Mr. Bouverie amuses himself all the time at my expense, as if I were a child, sure enough, as he so often calls me. He thinks it the height of absurdity to cry over a novel, as if any one could help it, when the words seem to dig into the very heart, or as if any one would-so indulge that could help it. I am so afraid of that cold, splendid, sarcastic smile of his!-like sunlight on an iceberg. I must correct this feeling. What is the use of being afraid of a mere habitual expression that will go with my hus- band through life? This is sheer cowardice, and this feeling has lately come to me.- J'anary. We have had a ball at Bouverie. What a princely mien Mr. Bouverie has; how superior he is in bearing to all other men I   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUV EIE.     -   279 He received our guests with such elegance-he noticed the need of every one-he seemed gifted with ubiquity, almost, and yet, I think, our ball was a dull affair. I would not say this to another soul than yourself, my precious diary. It was certainly a dull affair. We had a fine band of music; the house was a blaze of light, and crowded with guests; the supper was a paragon of excellence and elegance ; the wines, they say, were exquisite ; the ladies (many from the capitaD beautifully dressed; I myself much flattered, much attended, and yet (there is no use disguising it) a cold restraint seemed to rest over every one. There was no laughter, thenvoiccs seemed subdued-everything was conducted in a new style of courtly elegance, and the question suggested itself to me, "Mav not a host be oppressively polished?' As for me, I   did  nothing  but try and  enjoy myself. I knew Mr. Bouverie would see thatno: one was neglected, and no one was; I leave heard this since from unquestionable authority. I found myself toward the close of the evening in a corner with James Staunton. His wife was not present. I tried, but could not ask for Frederick, as I knew I ought to have done; he seemed to understand the sort of .struggle that was going on within. ' My brother is coming home in spring," he said, "with his ship. You knew, I suppose, Mrs. Bouverie, that Eliza Jones died at our house?" I started-"I did not know this before," I said, quite pale and trembling. "You got your ring, I hope, and your letters?" he added, after a pause. I bowed in speechless confusion. I thought him very cruel, very insolent even.   280      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUV iER E. "You understand Frederick too late for his happiness," he pur. sued ;" if not " "I understand only that there has been a conspiracy," I inter.  rupted, sternly recovering myself; "to injure one dearer to me than life ; and the references you have made this night will divide us for ever, James Staunton." "Stay, Camilla," he said, calling my name with the familiarity of old times. "I have been abrupt, I know-it was not my in- i, tention to be rude; I might have retained proofs. of all this treachery to the great injury of others-I have not done this thing, and like you, I hope, that some deep laid motive of revenge or hate,: guided that dying woman I Let us be friends again." I turned, I gave him my hand; "On one condition only can , this be," I said; ithat you confine this matter to your own breast forever, you and yours, for my sake, for the sake of old friendship you must do this." He bent over my hand, much affected. He knows now that I did not jilt Frederick, as at one time he accused me of doing. I am glad of this at all events, for I do care for his respect, and that of his true-hearted wife. James Staunton is a noble man, and yet he is common beside my husband I They are starting in the career of life together ; men, I think, of nearly the same age. The same goal is before them, for they are ambitious, both. If I live until that time I shall glance with something of pride on my own oracular wisdom-back at this page of yours, dear diary, in which I record the prediction-that James Staunton will never pass the mediocrity of position, and that Erastus Bouverie stands on the topmost platform of his State at middle age. We shall see. *'  ,    " *     \ '   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUYtIE.      281 April. The winter has passed, spring is here again; how beautiful it is I The woods about Bouverie are putting forth their young tender green. The frogs are croaking around the lake. The birds are brooding. I met a bee to-day, " sent out to see about the weather." Paul says : Bees are the only creatures that write books according to him ; what a ridiculous idea! he believes that their little waxen cells are all scribbled over with the results of their experience. He reveres bees like Napoleon. He considers honey the choicest food of man, and would not kill a bee for any. reward one could offer. What a strange Egyptian idea of sanctity ho attaches to them- He thinks that when caught and imprisoned in a hollyhock flower, and held to the ear, a bee is compelled to prophesy. He regrets that he cannot comprehend these buzzing oracles ; but hopes, some day, to conquer the difficulties of their language I All this is serious, and yet generally, he is a sensible wight! With the sweet impulses of spring, has come one strange to me, yet sweeter than all the rest together. I hold a happy secret in my breast. I will not tell Erastus yet I Let him dis- cover it with those observing eyes of his. Dear Diary, to you alone I confide my hope, my joy ; yet, I am so young I so unpre- pared!

Dear Paul has quite signalized himself to-day, by his extra- ordinary presence of mind and courage, in defending me from the attack of a bull. We were walking in the clover meadow, when we saw that great black creature of Mr. Bouverie's, always con- sidered so gentle before, tearing toward us. Jis first impulse was to take my hand and run; but seeing that I could never reach the fence in time, he called to me to run as fast as I could, snatching my parasol away as he did so. I flew, and rolled over the fence before I reflected on my cowardice. The brave little fellow had opened the parasol suddenly in the bull's face, then dropping it, as the creature swerved with fear or asthnishment, he fled rapidly to the nearest tree before he could charge again, and climbed into its branches. The parasol was truly "a wreck" when it came to be ex- amined. In the meantime, some men from a neighboring field came to our assistance, and with strong lassoes caught and compelled the creature to subjection. They are going to bore his nose, and ornament it with a ring, for his caper. Paul is quite distressed "that he should have brought so much unnecessary pain upon himself." He is a dear, quaint child. I have a project about a little watch for him, which was my brother's once. , It has lain a. long time idle, and needs repairing. It is faced with blue enamel, and has an azure lion o0 the back   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BO-U VEIE.       283 (how natural 1), set round with pearls, in a goldframing that is very striking. The beast has ruby eyes, and a bristling mane, and one foot is placed on a mother of pearl ball, in a fierce and commanding attitude. I shall have the inscription put inside- , "The reward of valor "-with his name next to my brother's, and mine as the donor and obliged person. He is the sort of- child that will appreciate the motive, and take care of the watch. This will comfort me a little for not being allowed to crimp his frills. Paul and I have been making a flower-garden, a regular parterre. It is quite beautiful, we think, but I have burned my face dreadfully, and Erastus will scold. Never mind, buttermilk does wonders, and such gardens repay one for a little personal disad- vantage. I shall remind Mr. Bouverie with mild dignity that Semiramis made gardens. Let him answer that if he can I Paul has the sweetest little bantam chickens just hatched that ever I saw; but I still retain my passion for young ducks. I have a pen full, and I watch them half the day. What a sore waste of time it is after all; but who can resist the little callow things, 'so hardy and independent as they are, too? I promise myself great fun in seeing them swim to-morrow. Mr. James Staunton has been here. He says that Frederick has returned, and that Eliza Jones wrote to him also from her dying-bed. He is furious, and threatens to call Mr. Bouverie out. Oh, how terrible this news is to me I He believes that horrible slander, and Eliza Jones has gone to her account with. out recalling it.   284      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEwRE. Oh I what shall I do? What shall be done? I must go to Bishop Clare-but no-I remember now he is absent again on that troublesome southern trial. I cannot send for Frederick to come here.   Mr. Stauniton suggests that I shall go to Mrs. Duganne's ball next Tuesday. I had intended to refuse her, in my husband's absence, although a neighbor. He says Frederict will be there, and that I can do more with him than any one else.                      Mr. Bouverie will still be absent a fortnight. If I can only silence this matter before his return, all will be well again. Mr. James Staunton will be there also, and has promised to assist me. I will go, and remonstrate with Frederick ; he loved me once, and I love him still with sisterly affection. I have discovered that I never knew any other for him, although I did not know this until I truly loved. There is all the difference imaginable. I shall wear my wedding dress to Mrs. Duganne's ball, for the last time perhaps ; it will be out of fashion before I go out again. I will lay it by for my daughter to see, should God bless me with one.  She will value it, even if antiquated and yellow with time. It is of rich white satin, and this soon changes color. I shall go in my carriage, and need no escort; but for company, and to please him, both, I will take Paul Quintilian. I do wish he was a prettier child. Dress ruins him; he looks best in his little every-day blue jacket and trowsers. He has no style, no elegance ; his neck is short, his head is large, his hair bushy, though fine; his shoulders round, his features ,heavy, but   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        285 for his luminous' grey eyes, there would be nothing remarkable about him. I hear that his brother, greatly older, and about to be married, though soryoung, to the daughter of a Leyden pro- fessor, under whose tuition he has been five years, is a very hand- some man. What a pity that dear Paul could not have participated in this partial gift of nature! They were both wards of Mr. Bouverie, as I believe I said before, the eldest and youngest of a large family, else extinct. Luther Quintilian preferred to be educated abroad; indeed he was nearly of age when he fell into Mr. Bouverie's hands, and so little Paul became our only charge. God bless him I He is a real dear little ugly brother and true comforter to me; and I know whatever befalls either of us, he will protect my child. It is a great weakness of mine to love beauty so much. I must guard against it. It would be such a base thing for a mother to be partial to one child above another from such a motive I I think I have probably over-appreciated my own good looks, --laid too much stress on them, I mean. I must try to be good, and true, and religious. Oh, I wish my husband were a pious man; but it is dreadfully discouraging to a wife ,to be advised to be devout, when she sees laughter in the eyes of the adviser, and he her husband! I I will set Bishop Clare at work to convert Mr. Bouverie, as soon as he returns. I think he will make him a good Catholic yet. And of course a man of his culture and pride could not stoop to anything else-coming, I mean, from the family he did, in England, Catholic from the time of the Norman conquest.   286      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. As the time draws near for the party, I feel very tremulous. Perhaps I am taking too much on myself, and painful as, it would be, I had better let matters proceed tota settlement between Frederick and Erastus. Then again, I dread-oh I I do dread the result of such a meeting. Suppose there should be bloodshed, which words of mine might have averted I How I should reproach myself for- ever more! I know the very insinuation of baseness would fire Mr. Bouverie's chivalric blood, and disastrous consequences might ensue. It is best that he should never know (if possible to keep it from him) of what Eliza Jones accused him. Poor girl! May the holy saints protect her through all the horrors of Purgatory, and may she in the end gain the divine pardon, as freely as I grant her mine; yet it is very bitter to a proud man to be maligned, and Mr. Bouverie would resent it fearfully, I know. The matter must be silenced for the sake of all concerned. It is one involv- ing a woman's delicacy. - Frederick must see it in this light. I fewel very averse to meeting him, though, under my new cir- cumstances. What a kind, devoted fellow he ever was to me from childhood up. Perhaps, after all, -a simple nature like his would have suited mine best. There would have been less effort about my life, less constraint, and our tastes assimilated perfectly. Dancing and music, and rides on horseback, and flower culture, and bird train- ing, and novel-reading, and chatting about nothing at all. He loved all these things, and so do I; and I liked him just well enough for happiness. There is such a thing as loving too well for one's own peace-loving to anxiety, loving to morbidness even. It is thus I love my husband, I am afraid,   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       287 I cannot sleep. The events of this evening have excited me, and I sit down, attired as I am for bed, to confide them to you, dear diary. Paul, who was very weary before I left Moorfields, is sleeping soundly on his couch ; for, since my husband's absence, I have kept him in my room. His great grey eyes were fixed on me all the evening, like a guardian owl (not angeD I and he followed me from room to room, like my shadow; I made him hold my bouquet while I danced, to occupy him., which he did with the most ridiculous solemnity, like a page of olden time. But, oh dear, I am only putting off painful recordings by telling nonsense like this. I have been so agitated this evening I I have suffered so many old feelings to assert their momentary sway over me, that I feel self- accused and confounded ; yet I will strike off my impressions while their vividness remains, as I am told some theorist is trying to do pictures and portraits by the aid of sunshine and cameras in France. I can judge better in this way, when cooler moments arrive, whether I have been wrong to-night, or only naturally impulsive. I was dancing with young Duganne, when the two Stauntons entered, I saw them through the long vista of rooms, and grew quite giddy and faint for a moment; but soon recovering myself, I was able to disguise my feelings, and after the dance, to receive Frederick Staunton with self-possession and cordiality, both I think. At least it was my wish to blend the two. Frederick Staunton has -improved very much in appearance since I saw him. His naturally fair complexion is weatherbeaten now, and he looks far more manly than before, with his hand- some curling chesnut beard and whiskers, which he says he suffers to grow to protect his throat and face from cold, while holding his night watch at sea. Hib figure was always fine, and "  ' .           , , S O   288      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERm. there is no such dancer in the country; Certainly he is a hand- some man, and I believe him to be noble and true, that he, may find comfort yet in the love of a fair woman, is my earnest prayer; I shall ever cherish a sisterly affection for him, even after what has passed; but I thank heaven that my impulsive being was not consigned to his hands for safe keeping. More than for most women it is necessary for me to honor as well as to love my husband ; but I am moralizing instead of describing. I danced twice with Frederick Staunton before supper was announced, and we went into the banquet-room together, closely followed by Paul; James Staunton stood near us at the table. "If you have anything to say to Frederick," he whispered, "let it be said to-night. Hie will seek-a bearer for his challenge to-morrow, I fear, for I have declined the office, and the matter will thus be made public." So saying, James Staunton disap- peared, to walk to Grosvenor, his father's residence, about three miles this side of Croften. "He loves these moonlight walks," said Frederick, laughing, "grave sentimentalist as he is!" "Why, I thought he was the most practical of men," I re- turned, "married to the most practical of women." "Well, so he is, if truth be told ; but he prides himself on his manly habit of walking instead of riding whenever he can, and imagines himself romantic in so doing. Let him remain under his pleasing delusion ; for me; I prefer a fleet horse ; but, as I walked with him to-night to please him, I think he should have waited for me, out of humanity.  Suppose this poor helpless ' salt' were at- tacked by banditti going home to-night, perfectly unarmed as he is, even with a cane, what resistance could he make-I ask you, Mrs. Bouverie?"   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       289. "It is scarcely a supposable case," I rejoined, laughing; " but Frederick," I added, gravely, " you who meditate bloodshed are naturally haunted by such images." He started. "What do you mean, Camilla?" he asked, coloring violently. "Your good and thoughtful brother has warned me of your inimical intentions toward my husband," I said, firmly, " founded as these are on the death-bed fantasies of a much erring woman, and I have come here to-night, in his absence, to represent mat- ters to you calmly, and to appeal to your good sense, and our long intimacy as safeguards against your fatal impetuosity." ' Camilla," he said, "I cannot see that you have any concern with this business, it rests between man and man. I did not dream you were acquainted with my intentions-James was wrong." "James was right," I interrupted, drily; " he knew that my happiness hung on this matter, and its reasonable adjustment; he knew how baneful notoriety proves to the delicacy of every true woman. He wished to save me pain and you remorse." This conversation had occurred in the great hall, lying between the supper and dancing-rooms, the doors of which gave out at either end on long, moonlit porticoes. We were walking slowly up, and down, in the train of many-other couples, and once or twice heads were turned curiously, in passing, to catch the subject of our evidently excited conversation; no surmise could in any degree have approached the truth, yet to attract attention was in itself unpleasant to me.' Glancing into the banquet-room, I saw that Paul was standing with a group of children at the table, eating his supper. We were safe for a few moments from his watchful eyes ; I determined to conclude the discussion elsewhere. "We will walk on the gallery a few moments, Frederick," I VOL. In.- 13   290      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. said, " where we shall not be probably overheard ; I have a few earnest words to speak to you." The sound of the band recalled the stragglers from the porches to take their places in the dance, we found ourselves alone, at one end of the front portico, seventy feet long, standing by a great stone column, wound with ivy, and quite remote from the open door of the hall. "I will speak to you here, Frederick," I said, "I will ask you for my sake not to intrude this matter on public attention, nor yet on my husband's notice. Mr. Bouverie has no suspicion yet of Eliza Jones' revelations-delirium I believe them to have sprung from--I would not wound him by showing him her mad letter'to me, owmng her own treachery, and daring to fix its chief odium on him! He could not bear such a thing--he, a proud man." "Proud," he burst forth, striking his forehead passionately with his hand, "proud-he proud, Camilla? oh no," with a bitter laugh; " proud men do not stoop to robbery and assassination. He is a Thug, and as such I denounce him. He plunged his poisoned arrow into my life's blood, and turned it to gall. He stole, like a thief in the night, my greatest earthly treasure, your love, your confidence, Camilla, dearer to me a thousand fold than life, and he shall not pass unpunished." Frederick, this from you 1 I could not have believed it pos- sible that you could- so far forget the gentleman, the man of honor, as to assail a woman's ears with such language about her husband. I will not stoop to ask grace of a person capable of such behavior. Proceed as you will, Mr. Bouverie will know how to meet you," and I turned coldly away. I was startled by his passionate despair.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU ElII.    -   291 "Camilla, return," he said, securing both of my hands, and drawing me back into my first position, against the ivy-covered column, while he pressed his beating forehead and burning face on my icy fingers, and tears--scalding tears-streamed through them from his eyes, and convulsed his whole frame. "Camilla I sole idol of my life," he began.. , "Frederick," I said gravely, yet much moved, Idon't you know that you are injuring me by such exhibitions of emotion? You do not wish to do this, I am certain. Let me go, Frederick, our interview is over." I spoke in low, calm accents, yet he still clung io me. I drew my hands violently from him at last, and in so doing left my right arm glove in his grasp. "I will keep this glove," he said, " at all events, as a relic of one lost to me forever--a talisman against evil-a sacred safe- guard against temptation ;" and he pressed it to his lips, his brow, then consigned it to his bosom. There was a rustling among the branches of the thick lilac bushes that grew around the porch, at this moment, that recalled me to a stronger sense than ever of the indecorous nature of this scene. "Mr. Staunton," I said hastily, '"I am displeased with you ; we part here forever unless you restore my glove." "When I saw you to-night," he proceeded, as if he had not heard my request, " the centre of all eyes, more graceful, more beautiful than ever, if this thing were possible-you,. my soul's darling through long years-mine, by every right of justice and of feeling-yes, Camilla, mine still in the eyes of God himself. When I saw you as mortal eyes see spirits, divided from them by impassable barriers, yet lovely and attractive as when they wore earthly guise, how could I other than curse the. hand of steel that   292      THE' HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. interposed between 'us? For you would have been my wife, Camilla, you never would have broken faith with me had my let, ters reached you, nor fallen under the evil influence of a bold, bad man, fascinating, yet unscrupulous as Lucifer himself! For. give me," he said, impressed, I think, by my silence. "I have done!" "My glove, Mr. Staunton," I sternly repeated, as if I had not heard his rhapsody. He took my extended hand, he pressed it to his quivering and burning lips. His daring arm was suddenly flung around me-he caught me to his bosom, and held me there one moment in a wild, straining embrace. Then bounding over the railing of the porch before I had time to speak, to cry out, to repulse him, even, he was gone I I turned into the house pale, sick, agitated. I met Paul in the hall ; he had been seeking me. I took him by the hand, and we went silently to the dressing-room together. Aly carriage waited, I knew. As I came down wrapped for departure, I was met by 3lMr. Duganne with remonstrances about my early flight. "I am sick,"' I said, "Mr. Duganne ; I cannot stop to apologize now, nor to say good night to the ladies ; please explain for me." "You really are suffering," he said, kindly ; " your hand is like ice. I am afraid you have a chill; had you not better remain all night and have immediate attention?" "Oh, no, no 1"I said, almost piteously-pettishy, even, I fear. "Let me go, I shall be better at home ;" and with his assistance I got into the carriage and was driven away. Paul had preceded me by a few moments to the coach, and lay stretched out on the front seat. I thought he was asleep, until -at a turn of the road the moonlight revealed his great open eyes. be had heard me weeping. I felt really ashamed, yet there was delicacy in this silence. J   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVlEIE.   -   293 "A man laid this note on the seat of the carriage before you came down, Little Madam," he said, as he caught my eye; " and seeing me he started, then asked me to be sure and give it to you," and he handed me a folded paper. "What man, Paul?"I asked. "I did not see his face," he answered, "'his back was to the light; but he had curly hair, and no hat on. I could see that, and his voice was choked, as if he had been crying. I don't see what people call it pleasure to go to balls for, when it makes them cry so." I crumpled the .note in my hand. My first impulse was to toss it out of the window, but second thought convinced me that it would be wiser to keep than destroy or expose its contents. "You will not speak of thisjote, Paul," I faltered at last, "not at least until I give you permission. Promise me, Paul?" "I will mind what you say, Little Madam," he said, in his strange, old-fashioned way, as if a man's nature were speaking through the lips of a child. "After a while," I added, "I will have no secrets, and then I will read it myself to Mr. Bouveie; but for his good, Paul, he must not know this now." "Show it to Bishop Clare; that will answer," he said, drily. "Yes, he shall see it, Paul, as soon as he returns; in the meanwhile, I do not know myself what it contains." "A secret paper, no doubt," he observed, in his quaint way. "I have a pocketful of them myself to-night, for somebody, but I think they are foolish things." "You like the sugar plums they wrap much better, Paul," I said, laughing ; " you eat the comfits and keep the papers for me, is that the way you divide, Quintil?"   294      Em HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERTE.

"'You ridiculous imp," I could not help saying, half provoked; "what put that idea into your head?"

Dr. Moore says, I have had brain- fever. It began thus:  The night of Mrs. Duganne's party, I sat up late, writing, and then went to bed and slept heavily. I was aroused about day- light by a noise as of shutters opened, and raising my head I saw that one of the venetian leaves of the bow-window had been left ajar; when I awoke, the sunlight poured through the open win- dow. Paul was dressed and gone, and Bianca was moving about the room. Suddenly I screamed, and sprang up in my bed-a bloody glove was lying on the pillow beside me. I saw it dis-' tinctly-the hand, wet with crimson gore, the upper part still white, with the letters C. B. worked in white silk by my own fingers. My wedding-glove, the same H had worn the night before to the ball-and oh, God, the right-hand glove I I cannot be mistaken. I called Bianca and made her bring me -its fellow from the table where I had thrown it on my return. I compared them- there they were, left and right. A sudden frenzy swept through me. "He is dead i"I shrieked; "he has killed himself, and sent back my glove in his last despair. Oh, Bianca I where is the messenger that brought this terrible token? Call him to me; let me know all 1" "No messenger has been here--no one is dead that I have heard of," she answered, in her gentle way.  "Dear Miss Camilla, have you been dreaming about my master?" "Look at the love," I said ; " and tell me where it came from, if you do not wish to madden me." -      - "I can't tell, I am sure I I never saw it before," she said, trembling violently ; then taking it in her hand, she murmured- "It is wet with blood 1"   296      THE HOUSEHO6D OF BOU VEIIE. " Take it away," I said, with ghastly composure ; " and never let me see it again. Do you hear, Bianca? Stay, let no one see it, not even Paul-and send--no, never mind," I added, as the conviction flashed over me, that such inquiry might awaken unjust suspicion ; "we shall hear soon enough-soon enough, if indeed this be not a bitter and unprincipled conspiracy to make me suffer "  Bianca passed out of my sight, still holding the glove; yet she has forgotten all this now-and my husband thinks I was delirious then I They both declare nothing of this kind ever could have occurred ; yet, I know I was perfectly composed for hours after, until the tramping of those rapid hoofs was heard, and the news  was brought officially; yes, written in James Staunton's own bold hand, and directed to me, Camilla Bouverie. The few large words seem staring at me yet in terrible distinct- ness, wherever I turn. "Camilla, my brother has bben murdered; but by'whom we can only conjecture." Oh, my God I  what wonder that I fainted then-and woke to fall again into dream-like lethargy, and fever, and fierce delirium. Days had passed before my senses returned. I revived to find my husband and Dr. Moore beside me.   Through their inde- fatigable care my life had been saved. Mr. Bouverie came back three days after the murder-the author of which has not yet been detected. AMy husband, knowing nothing of the truth, considers the vision of the glove to have been a  sort of second sight, a warning of the fate of Frederick Staunton, whom he sincerely deplores, note withstanding his opinion of his conduct to me, and whose inten- tions toward himself he shall never know   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.    2. 97 But I cannot think this, I must believe that some wretch who witnessed the scene on the porch has found means of sending the glove to me, after the murder, adding mockery to crime, perhaps himself the slayer.              . James Staunton is almost distracted they say, accusing every one wildly, even his nearest friends, of the murder ; but I have not heard whom by name-a sort of general fury possesses him, Mr. Bouverie says-I want him to call at Grosvenor, but he thinks he can not leave me yet. He will go later he promises. James Staunton's conduct has been unaccountable indeed, but it reflects on no one but himself. I should not have known a word about it, had I not picked up a country newspaper, a fort- night old-all this occurred during my illness. The paper speaks of the malignity of his attempt to ruin Mr.. Bouverie, they are of opposite parties, and it is thought this operated with him. "At all events," the writer says, " the evil has recoiled on its author, and there let it abide forever." I hear that Mr. Bouverie's friends brought, him home in tri- umph, when the grand jury refused to find a true bill against him I Oh I to think, to think, that my noble husband has been attainted, for murder I Oh, merciful heaven, how bitter was this trial to a proud, unconscious, unoffending man I I cannot conceive how he bears it so firmly.

I should not have mentioned this trifling matter here, perhaps, but I am so grieved! I have found the missing stud, carefully put away in Paul Quintil's paint-box, and Mr. Bouverie is confident he dropped it during his absence. I know he wore them all away; I have not told him of this, I will question Paul privately ; could he have picked it up on his way to school, and kept it, knowing, as he must have done, to 'whom it belonged? I cannot bear to think my good boy would -be guilty of such a meanness, next to a theft. This evening I shall know all about it. Patience until then. I have told Mr. Bouverie my heart secret, he seems appalled at the idea that my illness may cause injury to our child. I am disappointed that he rejoices with me so little. He does not conceal from me, that his hope had been that we should have no family. "Husband and wife -never love each other so entirely afterward," he says ; but I cannot agree with him. I think it pos- sible he would be more dear to me as the father of my child, than he is even now, idolized almost as he knows himself to be. Poor Frederick! my heart grows sick whenever I think of him and his terrible fate! His murderer will be punished yet. God is just, and crimes work to the surface. Oh, heavenly Father, pity me-sweet Mary-holy Jesus have mercy on my sufferings I I am too miserable to live. Fight as I will against it, the horrible :conviction comes back, almost like madness. The little child that never spoke falsely in his life tells me that he picked tip the stud by the foot of his bed, the, morning after Mrs. Duganne's party, before I awoke. He saw it spark-   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       299 ling by the red light that came through the open shutter when le opened his eyes, and meant to restore it to me, but went to school before he had an opportunity. When he returned I was ill, he alleges. "And why did you not bring it to me, Paul; long afterward?" I said, with ashen lips. "Because, madam, I did not wish you to know, after we heard of Frederick Staunton's murder, what I knew." "What was that, Quintil?"I whispered, like one in a dreary dream, gasping and oppressed, my hand to my brow. "That Mr. Bouverie had been here that morning, before day- break," he said, in a low, reluctant voice. "Oh, Paul," I groaned, " never say that again, or you will see me die before you; say anything else, Paul I That you dreamed it, tell me you found the stud in the road, that you for- got you had put it away, while I was sick, that you picked it up in the garden, but not in this rooT, if you love me ; do not tell me you found it here, Paul"He was silent, his little face quiver- ing and blue with pain. "Speak to me," I said, "Paul; tell me something else about it; something different, you know Mr. Bouverie wasn't here, you were only dreaming, Paul." "I will not tell a lie," he said, "I am afraid God would be so angry; neither will I tell you the truth again ; I will never tell you any more, nor' any one else, while I live, about the matter, but, Little Madam, I knew it all the time." "What did you mean. to do with the stud, Paul," I asked, in calm accents of extremest anguish, after a long, long silence. "To give it back to Mr. Bouverie, and tell him I found'it,    300      THE HOUEHROLD OF BOUVERIE. after a while, when I would not have to make up a lie about it, when he had forgotten the matter." "Do so still," I said, "Quintil, but wait years rather than be- tray your knowledge, or it will fare ill with you, ill indeed; or I stay, give it to me," and I flung it through the open window into the grass. "Let it lie there forever, wash your hands of it alto- gether. I have no doubt Mr. Bouverie lost it before he left home, and had forgotten the circumstance," I added, liurriedly.  t The large clears eye of the child dwelt on me one moment, as if surprised, then drooped beneath its long lashes, confounded by the calm agony of my gaze. The subject can never be resumed between us. He will never breathe it to any one else, I know; -but this is not enough; oh I not enough I Despair has entered my heart. Where shall I turn? From whom    ask counsel? I cannot even to Bishop Clare reveal my dark misgivings. I have destroyed Frederick Staunton's note, iso innocent in itself, which I meant to show to him. I must never relate that interview, or anything connected with Eliza Jones, for fear of arousing suspicion. Her letter and the package it contained shall go into the fire, and I will lock this diary away where no human eye can see it, until I am dead. Then read and pity me, oh! kindred heart. It is autumn again; the branches of the trees, covered with parti-colored foliage, strain mournfully in the east wind to-day. The grass, still green, is strewn with yellow leaves, the blighted flower-stalks stand grimly in the flower-beds. A few late roses still struggle into partial bloom, but our glorious summer and fall garden is with the past. What a resource' a greenhouse would be to me! But Mr. . -    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVETIE.       30t Bouverie says it is not worth while ,to build one here, as we shall henceforth pass eight months of the year in Washington. His engafgements with government require his presence there, and my place is by his side. I was thinking to-day of my singularly friendless condition. I have no. relations, however distant, that I know of. I am cut off, by the nature of things, from the nearest intimacy I ever had out of my own family, and my husband long ago exacted a promise from me that I would form no new ones. Paul Quin- tilian is the only creature save Mr. Bouverie that I can rely on, and he is to me indeed dear as a younger brother. My own Charlie would- have been just about his age now, had he lived. His death broke my dear mother's heart, so I was left alone with cross-kind (which shall I call him?) old uncle Bouverie I Yet no woman ever had a more devoted husband than I have, and that is worth everything beside. When I look back over the past summer, and remember how severely I have tried his patience often, I can but think his conduct has been sublime. I struggled so long under that horrible nightmare that beset me, and which, right or wrong, I have determined to put under foot forever-for it has become a choice between such repudia- tion and madness with me now, and I eagerly embrace the first alternative. How sorrowfully he looked at me sometimes, when, with shud- fdering hands I would put his embrace aside-or fall suddenly weeping and agonized at his knees, like one utterly hopeless and despairing. He never upbraided or questioned me once-never sneered as he had been in the habit of doing before, at my emotion; but tenderly consoled me and forbore! Sometimes it was on my lips   302      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.-  to tell him what oppressed me, and to beg him for the truth ; but he gave me'no opportunity to do this. The slightest remonstrance -the least interrogation on his part would have brought every- thing to light. Alas, alas I he never wanted me to speak, only to bear, and be patient, only to forget, and to be reconciled to the inevitable I And this wise course, with God's help, I am pursuing. When I put aside the volume of crimson and gold, in which so much happiness, so much sorrow, such unparalleled horrors were recorded, I thought I had done with diaries I But I cannot live without some outlet for my feelings. God is so distant, the Virgin hears but replies not. Our Saviour is too majestic, has seen too much sorrow to be assailed with a weak woman's daily complaint-and earthly aid I have none! I must do like a lonely child, and talk to myself; and " make-believe" sympathy and companionship, and to fill this great void in my being, I have taken to my bosom another diary, a sober book, bound ina plain black morocco, and fastened with a clasp of steel instead of gold, a stern and mournful volume, like its writer. I have just recovered from long illness again. I know not why I have delayed to speak of this before-it certainly was nearest my heart with its sorrowful occasion, and its woeful dis- appointment all the time. My baby was born, a daughter, as I wished it, and perfectly formed ; but, oh I so fearfully marked! The thumb of a bloody hand seemed to have rested on its fore- head, and the four fingers on its left cheek, distinct, and crimson as flame. The curse of the bloody glove had descended to my poor innocent one. I was so ill at the birth that they did not   rTHE HOUSEHOLD OF BO U VEICIE.      303' show it to me for some hours afterward. I screamed and shud- dered, and hid my face in the bed-clothes, when I saw it, and afterward' fever rose, and I was delirious for days. When I returned to consciousness, they told me as gently as they could, that my baby was dead. Oh I . better so, perhaps, better so, for her own sweet sake, than to bear a brand of shame and sorrow all her days, for no fault of hers. I see now, for the first time, the Bible meaning- of the sins of the father descending to the children. Paul never saw my baby-but he has planted lily of the valley bulbs all around the little grave in the garden, where they laid her, the sinless, the nameless, little one. I find that since my convalescence, Mr.- Bouverie, notwith- standing his strong English prejudices against the race, has re- called my mother's black cook,' Aunt Furness, and that Dame McCormick singularly and suddenly disappeared soon after my confinement. It is supposed the poor old woman has had letters from her truant son, and has gone off to join him ; what a wild- goose expedition, for a deaf and rheumatic person,s already beyond middle life! For my own part, I prefer negroes as servants, having been reared as a child among domestics of this color, who, with the exception of Bianca, composed my mother's household. I never thought the sending them to Liberia, as Mr. Bouverie insisted on doing all of mine that would go, was any mercy or real benefit to , them-and the matter is proving the sagacity of my instinct already, above his polished judgment on this occasion, for ten of the fifteen are dead in one year, and the remainder discontented,   304      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEVRE.  yet unwilling to return, as they have some prejudice about i" retracing their steps, and putting on the yoke again!" as if negroes ever used such language! Aunt Furness, whose children, with one exception, belonged to other masters, stoutly entered her protest against going, and has been hired out ever since until now. She comes home willingly; and I am so glad to have her again. Dr. Luther Quintilian has been appointed to fill the chair of his father-in-law, the Leyden professor, lately dead, and is spoken of in the papers as a man of marked ability. I believe he is profes- sor of physiology, or some such thing. I am afraid I am very matter-of-fact.- I never could see much use in all these ologies, nor how the least possible interest could. be attached to them. Science would have been at a stand-still to this time, I fear, had there not been better materials in the world than can be found in my poor head ; but arts would have flourished well enough I I think I might have made a good musician, I never shall now, and I have unusual skill at the needle; I am not very fond of reading unless it be biography or fiction, and (tell-no one, dear Diary, not even your successor), to me, most poetry is a positive dead bore.

January 1st.  TWO YEARS LATER. We go next week to Washington, and close Bouverie until June. I have been extremely reluctant to leave my home, but as the time approaches I begin to think this arrangement is best for me. I shall never rally here, where the fingers of that bloody hand clutched my very heart-strings. I must go away, see new scenes, new faces, and try and forget I am not twenty years of age; yet, as Paul said, I am old already, so much have I suffered and endured. My very tone of voice has changed, I think, and has a pathetic -sound to my own ear. Mr. Bouverie pities me, I know, yet he never says one word that could lead me to suppose he had ever observed my depression, and evident anxiety. Bishop Clare has been here, to say farewell, and to hear my confession. He seemed surprised at the magnitude and number of the transgressions I laid before him, "neglect of duty, unrea- sonable discontent, apathy, indolence, unnecessary severity of speech, indulgence in tears, and wrong suspicions," and I cannot tell how many other offences of the same order. He looked very grave when I concluded, and begged me, for my own sake, to contend against these growing evils, and to Li   306      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIEo seek the consolation of prayer frequently, especially through the blessed Virgin, the friend of all desolate women I but he has enjoined no penance, and is very kind and fatherly to me, who never knew an earthly father. I was on the point of telling him everythhig more than once ; but I remembered that I had promised myself not to do this, at present, at all events. If he outlives me, he will read my diary, from first to last, and judge me more from the intentions than from the acts of my impulsive life. Paul is now eleven years old, and Mr. Bouverie means to send him to a capital school at Chapel Hill, where lie will begin his classical studies. I am very loath to part with him ; but I know it is for his good to go. He will come to us in Washington, during winter vacations, and at Easter, and spend part of his summer at Bouverie, and I shall visit him when I can. He is a dear boy, and we have borne sorrow together, of no ordinary description. Discretion could go no further than in this remarkable child, and then he is such a self-sacrificing little fellow I Very intelli- gent too, and beyond all other boys I have seen in comprehension and reasoning powers ; I think he would make a great lawyer or divine, but he has a strong proclivity for the medical profession. He is to have a pony when he comes back to Bouverie, and I promised to take his little dog Clarice with me to Washington, and,take care of her myself; I am foolishy fond of this beautiful little creature, the survivor of a pair of Italian greyhounds Luther Quittilian sent Paul, a year ago. He could not make her comfortable at school, even if he were permitted to take her i   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOWERIE.        307. with him, which the rules forbid. She requires nice attention, a warm basket by the fire, and cake, and cream, and a little rabbit skin coverlet to sleep under, and sometimes medicine, and good nursing to keep her alive, she is so delicate. Ever since my poor mocking-bird died so suddenly-so unaccountably I (well in the evening as it was, and dead on its perch in the morning), I have taken to petting Clarice, and, I am not ashamed to confess, that I do love the creature dearly. We shall take Bianca, and Jenkins, and Gabriel to Washing- ton. Aunt Furness will stay at Bouverie, with Mr. Grant, the gardener, to keep everything in order. "Let me see plenty of little ducks when I come home in May, to look, round," I said. "Aunt Furness, ducklings are my weakness-my delight." "I taught you, ferred de chicken meat, Miss Milla ; I always hear Gabe say you wouldn't tetch no black meat whatsomever." "La I Aunt Furness I I only want to see the ducks ; I love them too much to eat them."- "Oh, go 'long, Miss Milla I I reckon you like most of de odder white folks, you loves de, bes dars gwine; and when de time comes, dem lubly ducks will go to de spit, for comply, eben if you don't fancy dere dark meat yourself ; whare's your love den, Miss Milla, and what's it worth?" And the old humorist, in her line, turned away, shaking her sides with laughter. Mr. Bouverie would have been very much provoked had he heard this conversation. He cannot understand negro peculiari.. ties, and that they can be familiar without being disrespectful. The very impassable distance that color and bondage makes, ren- ders endurable from them freedoms that no white domestic could take without manifest impropriety.   308      TfIE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. For my part, I enjoy a jest with Aunt Furness occasionally, and it does me good to see lher stand with her arms akimbo, and shifting her old pipe, indulge in a good, hearty contagious laugh. She tells me stories, too, about my father and mother, forgotten by every one else, and full of interest to me. Gabriel, her son, the only child of hers I own, is very trying, but his mammy keeps him in oirder here. I am afraid he will be unbearable in Wash- ington, where there will be no terror of the rod before his eyes. I may do the imp injustice, but I shrewdly suspect him of poison- ing my mocking-bird, and have had a sort of horror of him ever since. Yet he is generally a good-natured creature. March. We have been in Washington a few weeks, and are well fixed in our pleasant city mansion, but- a slight circumstance has thrown a cloud over the commencement of our new career, which, weak as it may seem, I have so far striven in vain to shake aside. My poor little Clarice is dead I This is not all. I am pretty sure my husband killed her. I ought to have observed that he did not like to see me so taken up with the affectionate little crea- ture; but it was not altogether on her own account I loved her so. She seemed a link between me and darling Paul, whose whole value I never knew until separation taught it to me ; and I never could bear to repel her innocent caresses, for his sake. Then I felt so responsible for her safety, having promised to take care of her, and she was getting along so well. Nor is it her death alone, even .under all these considerations, that pains me so vitally. It is that Mr. Bouverie should have been cruel and perfidious   THE  IIOUSEHIOID OF BOUVERIE.     309 enough todestroy her (as I know he did), and so bring all the past fresh before me, with the insidious train of reasoning, that links one act ,to the other, and clutches the bloody hand again about my heart. I had gone downstairs, with my bonnet and cloak on, to drive out, had opened the front door, when I remembered that I had left my purse and card-case on the toilet in my dressing-room. I returned the nearest way, and found the missing articles, and was just about to run downstairs again, when I saw Mr. Bouverie reflected in the mirror, from the bed-chamber, the door of which stood open, pouring a white powder into a saucer. He had not heard my steps on the thick carpet of the dressing-room floor, and was unconscious of my presence. He stepped from his posi- tion, and I lost sight of him; yet still I stood transfixed. In another moment I heard Clarice lapping.   I flew into the room. Mr. Bouverie was standing on the hearth, watching her as she lapped her cream. I jerked the saucer away, and threw the contents into the fire, the utensil itself falling on the hearth, and shivering to pieces, from my nervous fingers. I seized my little dog wildly, and clasped her in my arms. "Erastus," I said, "what has Clarice done, that you should try to injure her?" I felt that my eyes flashed fire. He turned ghastly pale, "What do you mean!" he said. "Are you deranged? Do you suppose I have the evil eye that I cannot watch your dog feed without injuring her?" "She is in spasms now," I cried, feeling her struggle wildly. "For pity's sake, Erastus, give her an antidote-you can-you must! Oh, spare the little creature that loved me so-restore her, Bouverie-!"   310      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BNUVERIE. I might as well have pleaded to stone.' He turned coldly away. "If you choose to over-feed your dog, and kill her with kind- ness, it is no reason I should be insulted by base suspicions like these ." And so saying, he left the room, the house. I heard the ft'ont door slam heavily after him. I laid my poor little trembling dog in her warm  basket. I rang for Gabriel, and dismissed the carriage; then throwing off my wrappings, I sat down, dressed as I was, and chafed her poor limbs, and nursed her until she died. "Is there a rat in your trap, Gabriel?"I asked, as coldly as I could, as he stood watching the stiffening formn of the -exquisite little creature before us. "I'll go and see, Miss Milla,' he said hurrying away to survey the result of his favor-ite enterprise, and returning triumphantly with the trap itself. "Two on 'cm, Miss Milla!" he said, proudly ; "and mighty fine ones dcy is." "Put these pieces of broken saucer just as they are iuto the trap, and leave it here until you come again." He dropped them, one by one, through the wires, still coated with cream, as he found them. 'Now, Gabriel, go and dig a grave for poor Clarice in the yard fence corner, and when you are ready, come for her, basket and all." When he had disappeared, I gave way to a hearty burst of grief, and throwing the rabbit-skin over her insensible form, thus prepared poor Clarice for sepulture. I now turned my attention to the rats.  One was dead, the other in death agonies. In about an hour, Gabriel returned. -"I done dug de graib, Miss 'Milla," he whispered, in sepulchral   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVEtRIE       3" accents, rolling his eyes fearfully at me in his sable head, as if we were a pair of conspirators. '"Take her away then, Gabriel," I said, in steady tones, " and let the basket down carefully ; and- here, take your trap, too, and, Gabriel, this is for you," extending a Spanish dollar to him, "and be sure and put a piece of green sod over poor Clarice." "Good gracious, Miss Milla, my rats done dead I I was gwine to worry 'em so nice 1" "Be off, Gabriel, and don't open your mouth about rats to me, or any one else again I Or-or Clarice, either ; do you hear me, sir?" "I hears you, Miss Milla," he said. As he went out, sulkily, I heard him mumble' : "I 'spec you knows by dis time who 'stroyed your mocking- bird!" When Mr. Bouverie came home to dinner at five o'clock, I re- ceived him as if nothing had occurred to mar the serenity of our intercourse. He found me dressed, and seated as usual at that hour, in the- library, waiting for ,him. I had spent that day in wrestling with myself, and had conquered my worst enemy, per- haps. At first, my heart was full of anger and bitterness, and almost loathing. I have such a peculiar horror of cruelty. It is the one unpardonable sin to me, and this act appeared so wanton! "But my duty is plain before me at last," I thought; "I must let nothing come between us, even were it a shadow. I have found out his peculiarity-it is morbid, insane jealousy." As with a lightning glance, this 'was revealed to me for the first time; looking back this day over past events, and yet he has never said a word to this effect; but woe to all I love I "I   312      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.  must give up all affection, however innocent. I must be cold to Paul-manifest no peculiar pleasure in any society-abjure pets,  and even for his own sake, be guarded in my eulogies of Father Clare." My husband's conduct, after I touched this. chord of  motive, assumed a strange, terrible consistency in my eyes. "Had  our child lived," I thought; " he might have hated her even, for I the devotion I should unquestionably have lavished on her." Yet, after I had arrived at these conclusions, I found that I  could honestly respect Mr. Bouverie, more than when he seemed  I a mere reckless destroyer. "It is a mania with him through me.  I see it now," I reflected, "and I shall be accountable here-   after, if I do aught to aggravate that mental malady.  God spare  me further trials, though! the string of endurance, is very tense now--it may snap unexpectedly, if further pressure  be applied."  I made my resolutions to suit the present occasion, and adhered  to them.  I would never name the affair of that morning to him again, nor suffer him to refer to it. I would try and forgive himn for torturing me so cruelly in consideration of his self-torture, and merge my own wrongs in pity for his mental obliquity. All this I  determined on before he came. We dined tete-a- tete. I  had thought he might be ill at ease, but nothing could exceed his graceful self-possession. I had thought to be mag- nanimous in his eyes. I  was only fulfilling his expectation, evi- dently-my conduct was, in his estimation, a  mere matter of  course. He thought no more of my   dead Clarice, than I of Gabriel's dead rats I This is the worst of sophistry, it brings everything to a level, and Mr. Bouverie does reason away scruples, until nothing but' lawless expediency remains.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        313 Well, I have won my own esteem at least by the course I have pursued, and this is much I Friends came in after dinner, conversation flowed freely, and I ' took part in it to the best of my ability. aI never saw you so brilliant as you were to-night, Camilla," he said, when we were alone again; " you might lead society if you would try and do so, and give up engrossing follies--crimping frills, raising ducks, doctoring old women, little dogs, and the like; and hearing a pert schoolboy prate with evident delight." , This was too much! He was trying to make me believe that his cruelty was disinterested benevolence, exercised for my ad. vantage only. I could not trust myself to speak ; but I felt like the poor negro, whose hypocritical master assured him with every bloody stroke of the whip-that he was scourging him for his own good alone. "Massa," he cried, at last, in desperatioi'; { I can stand de whipping, if you will please, sir, lef out de lies!" For the first time, Mr. Bouverie's approbation was a matter of indifference to me, and his fine compliments fell on an insensible ear-I must write these things or die. I have written to Paul about the death of poor Clarice, but I gave him no details; these he can never know. He will be much distressed at first, but boys soon get. over such things. He writes to me long and very original letters ; they are the chief excite- ment of my life, better than ball, theatre, Congressional debates, or levee to me. This great tide of gaiety rolls over my heart, as a river over the stones in its bed, that can never be lifted out: of their deep heaviness. Did I love my God, my husband less, I might merge my exis- tence in the world of fashion, and become a leader, as they call. , VOL.

An artificial atmosphere of happiness might thus be compelled around me, but I am not constituted for such a life; it would kill me, body and soul. Mr. Bouverie is much absorbed with great chemical experi- ments just now, and dreams of future fortune. He is in corres- pondence with many distinguished men of science in foreign countries, and I have proposed to undertake the part of amanuen- sis for him. But, to. my- astonishment, he resolutely declines my offer. He gives-as his reason, the confinement to which it would subject me, and I am indeed greatly relieved by his refusal, I am not strong enough, nor patient enough, perhaps, for such seden- tary employment; yet I meant to do my duty in offering. Mr. Bouverie is much attended to, and admired in society. I ought to be, I hope I am proud of being his wife. His indiffer- ence to female society is alleged, as his only deficiency by the ladies of my acquaintance, and this is true of him. Women bore him terribly unless they are very old; or very silent, and yet he is always urging me to .talk, and will sit by and listen while I keep up the ball of badinage with the keenest internal amusement. ' -          \       I. Napoleon's disastrous captivity is still the general theme. I do not pity him, because I never admired his cold, rapid, unscrupu- lous course, and as he had no generosity himself, I am glad he was deceived in estimating that of the English-the English; so late our self-imposed guests at Washington, and who left behind them their mark in fire and blood nearly obliterated now, thank God I  But to return to Napjleon.

Mr. Bouverie defends him with eloquent sophistry. I cannot bear to hear him talk on this subject. A man's notions of right and wrong get so confused when murder and robbery are called conquest, and selfish cruelty, national expediency-I hate that word expediency--it jars on my ear, no such thing ought to be admitted in any code of morals. There is a novel out called Waverley, very brilliant and wonder- ful by a new unknown author, which the critics say is to eclipse all that has gone before. Truly this is an age of genius and pro- gress too! The Diary continues year after year ; but as my object is only to supply the missing links in the story of Lilian de Courcy, I will pass over its very brightest portions, consisting of descriptions of Washington life, and notable people, always coming back to the ceaseless melancholy within fixed, and even cheerful now in its way, and borne as a martyr bears his cross, firmly if not hopefully. It is evident that Mrs. Bouverie was never able, either through prayer, or affection, or gaiety, or reason; or study, to master the corroding conviction that in some way her husband was connected with the murder of Frederick Staunton, nor do I think she ever loved him after this 4thought became habitual to her, with the same unreserve and intensity -of feeling. -Perhaps this very con- straint on her part kept alive his passion in fuller force, constituted   316      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. as he was. He seems to have almost laid aside his sarcastic levity of speech, startled as he must have been by the conse- quences of his own reckless vengeance, and to have idolized her even morbidly through life, though certainly evidencing in a peculiar manner, his fondness and untiring vigilance. There must have been more of " old uncle Bouverie " in his nature than she imagined. High breeding alone would have prevented the same , exhibitions of malice and ill temper ; but that Erastus Bouverie was one whose path no man might cross in safety, and whose unscrupulous ideas of vengeance no limits could define, has been shown elsewhere, and need not be now repeated. I pass over a lapse of nine or ten years, before I make my next selection from the Diary, as important events, now begin to close round the life of Camilla Bouverie. October. We have returned to Bouverie to live. The house. in Wash- ington is given up. Erastus has resigned his appointment there, and will devote himself for a time to his scientific pursuits alone. He has fitted up one large room in the wingo for his laboratory, and another adjoining it, as 'his library. We find Dame McCor- mick, so long an exile, ensconced again at Bouverie, fulfilling all her ancient duties, as if she had never left them off. As soon as Aunt Furness died, she returned, yet, how she heard of this event, or by whose permission she resumedI her- kitchen functions, I have yet to learn. I am rather disposed to think it was a' piece of consideration on Mr. Bouverie's part that has brought her back again; a mis-e taken one, I confess, as ,far as I am concerned. I should so much have preferred a vigorous young woman in the same posi-   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        317 tion she occupied I Besides, I never really fancied Dame M Cor- mick. She is horribly cross, and almost entirely deaf now, and I have learned to rule better since she lived with me before," which will, I fear, ill suit her hot Irish temper. She is, besides, encumblered with a hideous grandchild, about two years old, brought and dropped, literally, on the threshold of her cottage (as a cat might carry its starving kitten to be fed) by its degraded, dying father, a few months before--the son she had vainly pursued through many years, and at last, despairing of meeting again, beheld only in death I How many quiet tragedies are played in life I This creature lies before the kitchen-fire in a basket, like a little animal, moaning fearfully, having received some injury to the spine, Dr. Moore thinks, and probably an idiot in conse- quence, but keenly alive to the instinctive voice of nature, devour- ing as it does almost incredible amounts of food suitable for its tender age. I have not said a word about this singular return of Dame McCormick's to Mr. Bouverie, nor he to me-so each may be in error after all, as to the share the other has taken in the transaction. Yet, what good would an explanation effect? We cannot turn the poor old creature out, now that she has thrown herself (if thus it be), on our charity-nor' have I found any reasonable cause of complaint against her yet. Her eye is as quick, her hand as neat as ever, her food as well prepared; but that mystery repels me from her-which she does not offer to explain away, and which involves the last twelve years of her life! There seems a tacit consent between Mr. Bouverie and myself, that we shall never question each other agai ndeed, our lives, although apparently passed together, are really divided by a cold,   *UTIE HOH8EHErOLD OF BOUVERIE..X invisible barrier.

He is three years younger than Paul, but carries off the first honors. Paul stood second. They are a splendid pair of youths. Such generous specimens of truly cultivated men, above envy, admiring and appreciating each other as they do so thoroughly !    X Paul is twenty years old past, and commences his medical studies very soon. He will go to Philadelphia, where the best school of medicine exists, and afterward, if he likes, to Paris, to walk the hospitals; but just now his home is here, and I am trying to forget how soon I shall have to give him up again. Oh, if my daughter had lived, and it had pleased heaven to give her such a husband! Truth, talent, manly bearing, infinite sweet- ness of character, and firmness of purpose, all combined, make himn one of the rarest, most perfect specimens of human nature I have ever met with. He is mutch better-looking, too, than I ever thought he would be from the promise of his boyhood, i e handsome certainly in my partial eyes, though not usually con- sidered so. But let me not repine over the inevitable past! Bishop Clare comes to-morrow, and I hope that I shall have fewer sins of im- patience and discontent to answer for %han when I last made my confession. I have indeed prayed and wrestled of late,' yet I am still very far from being either good or religious. I am naturally so vain and worldly, and so " earthy and of the earth," that I cannot realize as I ought to do the great subjects of life and death. Holy Virgin, chasten me with thy mild counsel, and lead me with thy strengthening hand. Teach me tolove myself, and my poor transient beauty less, which I spend so much precious time in adorning. I am conscious, sinfully conscious, that as I grow   320      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. older, I attach more and more importance to my appearance, once considered as a mere matter of course. I was so flattered in Washington, that the snares closed around me, struggle as. I would,-and I triumphed at last in the power mere physical accident had given me. I do hope that living at Bouverie will whip the offending Adam, or rather Eve, out of me, and make me sensible of the truth, that I am weak, offending, unworthy, save through the precious inter- cession of saints, and my Lord Jesus Christ-a child of dust, nothing more. There is no hope of making dear Quintil a Catholic.  He is essentially Calvinistic in his views, I find, much to my regret; and as for Clavering, he is a declared Unitarian, which means just nothing at all. What Paul can see in that gloomy Lutheran religion, to make him incline to its doctrines, I cannot conceive. Predestination is such a paralyzing, fatal belief to hold, and what can be more hideous than the doctrine of the elect? No death- i bed repentance either, no hope for the dying sinner! Oh! if this dark creed be true, vainly indeed did our Saviour say to the repentant thief on the cross, "Verily, I say unto thee, this day ; thou shalt be with me in Paradise." I  am so grateful that I ( was raised a  Catholic. , nd, more and more, each day do I per- - ceive how suited to all frames of mind, to all conditions, to all j needs, are its tenets of hope and consolation. Letters from  Dr. Luther Quintilian inform us that he will return before long, to reside in the United States again. His wife, -the daughter of the Leyden professor I  have elsewhere   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        321 mentioned, died last year, we now hear for the first time, in child-bed. Poor thing, she had lived childless many years, and just as the sweet promise of maternity opened before her, she per- ished. A fair, beautiful woman she- must have been, from the accompanying miniature, but frail as a snowdrop. I do believe there is much more tenacity of life in dark than in fair people. Could anything kill me? I really feel that I shall live to be as old as the wandering Jew ; no one ever realized the possibility of death so little. This seems fatuity, but I can- not help it. It is constitutional, life consciousness -with me; there ought to be a phrenological bump for this quality. Father Clare thinks my character improves, strengthens. I hope he is right, but I do not think I am good as I used to be, not half so innocent, so credulous, so sweet-tempered. I am a little hard and sarcastic now, sometimes, even, when I ought least be so. I am a curious compound of cowardice and courage. I who run from a dog or unmolesting cow, have stood unmoved with a loaded pistol to my head. Oh, my God! let me not think of that, it was the bitter drop that made the cup run over. "Done to try me"--was it? What right has any hlman!creature to try another thus? Suppose I had swerved; suppose his hand had trembled--what then T? A little more bloodshed, that would have been all. But I did not care enough to push the machine aside, and yet I am beloved-strange, strange inconsistency! February. Luther Quintilian has arrived. He came straight to our house, as he should have done, on hearing that we had left Washington to return there no more, and found all that he cared to see in "*   322      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.. America assembled under one roof. I did not witness the meet. ing between the brothers. I had gone to Croften to the stores, on the morning of Dr. Quintilian's unexpected advent, and missed the great pleasure it would have given me to see their fraternal embrace. They seemed to have quite recovered from the agitation of the greeting when I returned; and dressed just as I was-with my cloak and furs on, and my hat and feathers-and quite unconscious of a strange presence under my roof, entered- the drawing-room. Mr. Bouverie was seated before the fire, talking with unwonted animation to some one, whose back was turned to me. Paul and Earnest Clavering were on the sofa in the corner together, and between them was seated a child. I can realize the expression now-"Non Angli sed Angeli." I opened the door softly, and stood among them before they knew it. The gentlemen rose to their feet. "This is my wife, Luther," said Mr. Bouverie, with real pride, I could tell from the tone of his most expressive voice. "Camilla," he added, taking my hand and placing it in the extended palm of the stranger, "this is my ward, Luther Quintilian." The stranger clasped my hand, and bowed low, almost rever- ently, over it; then looking full into my face, as he raised his head, he said: "I had thought to have seen you much older, Mrs. Bouverie. Paul never mentioned how youthful you were, or". He hesitated and colored slightly, but his eye, his smiling lip, supplied the rest of the sentence. "How beautiful, Luther, you would like to say if you dared," said my husband, "you are not peculiar in your opinion," he added,/drily/ (^,.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       3823 "I certainly expected to see a much more matronly guar- dianess, if such a coinage be permitted; but I think I can bear- the disappointment patiently," he said, laughing. Mr. Bouverie seemed well pleased that he should recognize my claims to youth and beauty, matters that he is jealously anxious should be considered a part of his wife, and to the decline of which he looks with even more concern than I do myself. "And, now, Mrs. Bouverie, let me show you the little oppli- cant for your favor that still remains unnoticed," and he brought me from the' sofa, Where he was sitting contentedly, the beautiful baby boy I had observed on my entrance. "Not unnoticed," I said, "only biding his time until I had made friends with ihis father; I saw the little creature as I came in," and I repeated the thought that had risen in my mind as I beheld him. He seemed pleased, touched even, when a moment later the baby, in answer to my invitation, held out his hands to come to me, and put up his rosebud mouth to be kissed. "He certainly is;"I said, " the most seraphic child I have ever looked upon I Oh, Bouverie I have you remarked his beauty, its remarkable character, its perfection?" and I bore him to my husband and placed him in his arms.  "How I wish," I mur- mured, in his ear, "that he was mine!"I almost trembled for the consequence of this impulsive speech, and was gratefully sur- prised when either from courtesy, or the mood of the moment, he said aloud: "Do 'you hear, Luther? my wife is craving your son. Won't you give him to her?" I ought to have known him better than to catch at such a straw as this mere lip-deep expres- sion ; but I was completely carried away by the idea of possessing such a treasure, and I turned earnestly to the father. "Do let me keep him for you, Dr. Quintilian," I said, "at least until yout  -*  .      *  *     4     .   324      THE HOUSEHOLD OB BOUVERIE. have a home for him, and a better protection than I can be, again." Paul had been whispering to me in the meantime that his nurse had died at sea, and seemed excited and delighted with my sudden; but no less earnest scheme. "I have n6 children-he would be such a solace to me, Dr. Quintilianl"I urged. I saw Mr. Bouverie frown-it was too late now ; Luther's fine face quivered with emotion ; " were I to choose from all God's creatures that I have ever seen, from externals alone, one to confide my chief treasure to, you should be that one," he answered, and it was decided that, for the present at least, I should take the place of mother to the little Jasper. All this was concluded before I had laid off my wrappings, and when I went to my room, I bore my '*   baby with me, laughing, playing, crowing, wild with. delight, the sweetest thing, of fifteen months, that ever bore' the human shape I I rang for Bianca. "Will you help me take care of him A? I said, all elate and triumphant as I held him up, in his little scarlet dress, so waxen white, so bright, so beautiful I "Where did he fall from, Miss Camilla?" was her involuntary expression. "From heaven, I do believe, Bianca. The expression- is just. Se is mine, at least I know he will never leave me when I teach him to love me, and his father has not the heart to break mine, after such ties are knit. i Oh! Bianca, my prayers are answered, God has given me an infant." 'Our late dinner hour arrived before I remembered that there were other claimants on my time and courtesy below stairs ; I could not tear myself away from Jasper ; I had already ransacked his little trunk, and arranged his clothes in drawers ; I, had fed himn from a cup and spoon, provided once for my own baby. I   T  IE HOUSEtOLD OF BOUVERIE.      3 had enjoyed his infant sweetness, as one passionately inhales a tea rose ; I had curled his lovely sunny hair, examined his waxen hands and feet, admiring their aristocratic beauty, and small rose- tinted nails; I had shown him pictures, flowers, images; had given him the little marble greyhound to play with thatI cher- ish from its resemblance to poor Clarice, and even suffered him to take the blessed candle from its ormolu stick and bite against its waxen surface, leaving the print of his baby teeth on either side. The long banished cradle of satin wood had been brought from its place of exile, and restored with honor, blue velvet quilt and all. I laid him down in the downy nest, where at last he dropped to sleep, and leaving Bianca beside him, I hastily made' a fresh toilet, not forgetting the coral comb my husband likes, and descended to the drawing-room. Paul and Clavering were engaged at chess. Mr. Bouverie and Dr. Quintilian, deep in a scientific discussion. I hoped they had ' not missed me 1 "I feared you were unwell, my love," Erastus said, " when you failed to reappear; I was about to seek you several times, but reflected that you might possibly have engagements, busy house- wife that you are I What new cream or jelly have you been concocting to suit the fastidious appetite of our European guest?" He spoke gaily, joyously, taking my hand and drawing it under his arm as he did so, for such was his custom at the dinner hour, and Gabriel now threw the doors open with his usual absurd bow, and ceremonious, announcement--      ' "De diunah "waits" "You forget, Mr. Bouverie, the claims of our guest," I said, offering to disengage my arm, to cross the hall with him. "Not so," he said, a little sternly, " let the young men come   326      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. in together," and we proceeded in this order. Dame McCormick had done her best ; there was nothing to complain of, but the dessert owed none of its abundance nor flavor to the hand of the mistress of Bouverie on that! occasion; conversation flowed brilliantly, wine sparkled, lights were brought with the fruits, and Gabriel withdrew. Just then the door opened and Bianca entered, bearing the beautiful baby boy in her arms. "-He would come down," she said, in a deprecating way ; " he  pointed to the door and begged so hard." "Ah, little rogue," said his father, extending his arms for him, into which he sprung eagerly, burying his head in the bosom of the superb man to whom he owed his being. *' Jasper!"I said, in persuasive tones, "Jasper," I held a bunch of grapes before him, "come, baby, come to me!" He looked at his father, then at me, as if to conciliate both, then pushing aside the grapes with his baby hand, for he does not love fruit yet, he clasped my neck, and glided into my lap, as naturally as a child comes to his own mother. "You   have conquered him  already," said Dr. Quintilian. " ow wonderful is the freemasonry between child and woman ; but blood is stronger still, see, I will tempt him back!" and he tried in vain. I really felt quite triumphant, and my cheek flushed with pleasure, I was so happy in the possession of my new toy?-no! my living, loving, earnest human soul, in its almost angel guise and infant purity. Oh God, I thank thee I! Blessed Virgin, I ac- knowledge thy merciful intercession in the divine gift of providence, which I cannot doubt was intended to, reward and encourage me. Let me never lose sight of my responsibility! O   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BO-DV ERIE.       327 I have no reason to think, so far, that I have committed an error in assuming the charge of Jasper, although once or twice I fancied a little cloud on Mr. Bouverie's brow, as he saw me minis- tering to him myself. Since then I have thrown menial (maternal- duties they seem to me), entirely into Bianca's hands, and even suffered, greatly to my regret, his cradle to be removed to her chamber. I must not be unreasonable about him, nor too much absorbed in my care of him, or I may awaken the ill fiend again I I have even heard him cry, occasionally, he that cries so sel- dom, without going to him, because I felt my husband's eye was upon me, my heart beating wildly all the time, for I do love him so dearly, so passionately almost. Oh, this is such a fault of mine I ,I am excessive, and the very restraint I have placed on my feelings for years has strengthened, instead of weakening them, when once they are let Loose. Indeed, I think that from early youth up to middle age some natures grow in power, in depth, morally as well as intellectually. Burke says, that his imagination improved until he was forty, and I know I can conceive of, and bear emotions now, that would have crushed me when younger. But I am by no means as good and gentle as I was formerly. I am far more bitter and rebellious--and am sometimes a little afraid of myself. There is much more in me than I knew of once. I know that I could die in defence of this little child, and defy any one that lives, in its behalf. M arc I think I like Jasper best in his little blue gown trimmed with white swansdown. His father thinks it exquisite ; I made it for him with my own hands; and in his jaunty velvet cap and feather, also !  '    328      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERTE. my handiwork, he looks like one of Sir Joshua Reynolds' children. Dr. Quintilian goes to-morrow to Washington, where he takes up the office Mr. Bouverie laid down. He resigned his chair in Leyden, in consequence of having received this offer. Paul and Ernest will follow soon, each to pursue the profession he has chosen-medicine and law. What a pair of shining lights they are going to be! Dr. Quintilian has given me the last work out by the author of Waverley, shrewdly suspected now to be Walter Scott, the poet I That "Homeric Bard!" as Mr. Bouverie calls him. What a wonderful genius he has-and how appropriative I I have heard lately, from unquestionable authority, that the beautiful charac- ter of Rebecca in this last work, Ivanhoe, was drawn from the life-like description he received through an intimate friend of a lovely and gifted young Jewish lady, who lives in Philadelphia. ] am  all curiosity to see her I My informant tells me, that she is as good as she is intelligent and beautiful--and that her family hold their lineage from the lion-like tribe of Judah I this is to nme very interesting and romantic I Since I have been the happy possessor of my little Jasper, my heart has opened to all helpless little ones-even to that moan- ing horror in the kitchen. Its lifeless limbs are arrayed in the cast-off raiments of my bonny boy-and I have made the old dame happy, by this simple act of thoughtfulness. How mighty is the electric' chain of blood--oh, if it had pleased the Almighty to have given me  children! Vain, sinful repining this; I have a substitute that mustf-that does satisfy me!   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       329, I spend a few hours each day with Jasper in Bianca's room- those of Mr. Bouverie's absence or seclusion in his laboratory. When he is in the house I remain with himu entirely, and, since I see that he prefers it, without the presence of the child. I had taken him into my chamber a few days ago, when I thought Erastus was gone abroad for the day, and was sitting on the rug with him before the fire, building card-houses for him, which he swept down whenever I gave the signal, with merry screams of delight, when Mr. Bouverie opened the door softly and stood be- hind us. I saw that he disapproved of my folly, from the cloud on his brow. Partly ashamed, partly determined, I arose and threw myself on his breast. "Oh, Bouverie," I said; " do not be displeased I Suffer me to love him. I have no children, and my heart yearns so to this little one." "Love whom you please, Camilla," he said, laying his arm coldly over my shoulder, and averting his face. This is a mat- ter in which there can be no dictation--love cannot be compelled or restrained by the commands of any man ;yet, for your own sake, take the experience of the world, which tells us, that to lavish love on the offspring of others is a thankless office at best.) Blood is your only sure binder, and the child you -foster thus may sting you yet!"                    - "Never!"I spoke With clasped hands and flushing cheek, for I had withdrawn from his cold embrace and stood before him now, while the child, as if conscious of his sentiments toward him, had clung to' hmy dress, and hidden his face among its folds. "The seal of perfect love and perfect truth has been placed on his pure brow, by the Almighty hand too visibly, Erastus, to permit of change like this ; Jasper-will be the consolation yet of our old age.?'     .              .   330      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVER IE He turned, still wearing his hat. and great-coat, and left the room with that haughty and dissatisfied air, that I so well under. stand, and as the door closed he darted a look at 'me, one of his old looks, that almost withered me I Coward as I am, my knees shook and smote together, as if some unknown evil menaced both Jasper and myself; for minutes after he went out I clung to the mantelpiece sick and dispirited. But soon collecting myself, I called Bianca to remove Jasper, and after arranging my toilet-a  matter about which Mr. Bouverie is scrupulously exacting--I went down to him. He was reading his .papers when I entered; but throwing them by at once, he rose and received me with a bright smile and peculiar courtesy, than which there is nothing more graceful, more princely, in my estimation. Placing my chair by his, he took my hand and made me sit by him, while he talked on in those silvery accents that fascinate and interest every listener. He spoke of one of his' favorite poets, Coleridge, and recited portions of that weird poem, ' Christabel," and that lovely thing,  "Genevieve," gazing in my-face all the time, as if he meant every word for me. What power he has over me, and yet how he has aoused it. Oh, memory!-back, back) to your cell I A YEAR LATER April. Since spring opened, we have taken back our large octagon bedroom, with its great window giving on the lawn. The baby plays half -his time on the velvet sward, within range of my eye -he gathers his lap full of violets and crocus-flowers, and creeps - p the steps, through the window, and brings them to me, lovingly.              -      '   - ,             ,   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VERIE.        331  Yesterday, as he stood before me in his great size and princely -beauty, for a creature just two years and six months old, with his flashing, azure eyes, his crimson cheeks,-and golden curls, I    , ; said, gravely, laying my hand on his lovely arm, extended with    / its gift of flowers : "Jasper, which of the angels in heaven do you most re- semrble?"  I heard - low, mocking laugh; I looked up,- Mr. Bouverie was passing the window. I felt indignant to be so watched, so humili- ated constantly. The child is angelic, body and soul, and when his sweet dewy lips are pressed to mine, I feel a thrill of happi- ness, such as I never knew before. I claim this indulgence as the only reward I ask for long suffer- ing; for years of forbearance, solitary anguish,  agonizing doubts, unflinching obedience. I only ask permission to love this child, and I will not be denied. He is mine, mine. His father will marry again, and rear a new family; the kin- dred of this infant are all dead on his mother's side, and Paul and I will cherish him, between us, for something tells me that Paul, will never marry. He is so proud, so diffident, so unattractive to the stranger, so slow to form attachments--now Clavering is very..  different. He is falling in love with every new and beautiful face, 'and has been said, young as he is, to have addressed Annie Blair. I do not know how the affair will turn out.

THE HOUSEHOLD, OF BOUVEtIE R      333. I saw James Staunton yesterday, I was standing on the steps of Mr. Howe's store in Croften, when he passed by.

What a great, noble, feeling soul that man has I What an apostolic nature I Hle does not dream of the truth, but he feels that gross careless- ness, to say the least, was at the bottom of Jasper's injury; and yet not one word, or look of reproach-not one hasty rebuke has left his lips! Yet how he has- suffered-his wasted frame, his pale cheeks attest-so lately sound and rosy, with the health of foreign habits, and serene feelings. He forgives Erastus! He pities me even more than himself. He is willing, if it be God's will, to give up his child. But at length we know, with joy unspeakable, that the child will live, and that his mind is uninjured, although one whole side of his frame and face are paralyzed. He cannot speak; he -will probably never speak again, the physicians think; but his eyes are clear, his power of swallowing returns, and he smiles occasionally when free from  pain, and stretches out one hand beseechingly whenever I leave hhin, even for a moment. He seems to love his father again, after his long, faithful ministering about him, and pats his face affectionately. I am perfectly crushed by this blow, and its accompanying horrors. I  will record them here, impelled as I feel to do so by some power stronger than myself, that commands me to testify to the truth in imperishable words. But to no living ear shall I ever confide the terrors that beset me, and make my  earthly path so - dark, so hopeless.            . Everything passed so quickly, I  can scarcely realize it yet. The child was playing on the lawn, at five o'clock, when I went into my room to change my dress, before receiving Mrs. Blair  and her daughter, leaving himn th Bianca.   !' i  THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       33  It seems she left him while she cut the cake for Gabriel to hand in the parlor. The ladies could not stay to tea, and needed refreshment after so long a drive. They left after partaking of cake, and wine, and fruit. It was now nearly six o'clock. Mr. Bouverie, I knew, must have returned, for though I had not seen him, I had heard Sahib's hoofs strike hard on the turf, as he galloped past the window of the drawing-room. I met Bianca, pale and trembling, as I went back into my chamber.                ! "I cannot find Jasper," she said. ",I have missed him ever since I went to the pantry for the cake and strawherries." "Not find him.?" I said, anxiously., "We must find him, Bianca; you have. been careless to leave him out of your sight a moment. Oh! where, where can my baby be?" I went through the house, calling his name loudly. I flew ' upstairs. I examined every bed. I looked tinder the dining- room table, covered with its deep cloth ; in closets, bookcases even, in the most improbable places, with no success. In the meantime, Gabriel was flying wildly around the yard; and Mr. , Bouverie had gone to the lake, to search for him, I supposed, The very thought of seeking him there, brought such an agony of hopelessness to my mind, that I sank down, and burst into flood after flood of tears. But it would not do to indulge thus. r rose up and renewed my search. The key of the laboratory was in the door. I opened it, and went in. The room was dim. I threw the shutters wide open-these also gave on the back lawn-and peered anxiously through the apartment, crowded as it was with chemical apparatus.   Oh, God I in one corner lay a little bundle of white clothes-I thought, at first, a heap, such as one would throw on the floor   336      THE- HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVTRIE. of soiled linen for the laundress. I approached it. I raised it up. That flaccid mass was Jasper! My shrieks summoned speedy assistance, or rather brought the whole household together, for no assistance could be rendered. Among the foremost was Mr. Bouverie. "He must have touched the wires of the charged battery," he said, in a cold, dry voice ; "the shock has killed him." I turned upon him one look, to haunt him, I hope, until he dies. My quivering lips refused to utter -their indignant accusa- tion ; but I would not let him touch my baby--no, he never shall again while life is mine! I carried him myself to his little bed. I bathed his lifeless limbs with stimulants, bound ice to his fore- head, poured reviving drops down his poor, unresisting lips, did whatever my own weak judgment suggested, then sent Gabriel off for Dr. Moore, and wrote to summon his father. Two days-may I never know' such again while life is mine -two days elapsed before Dr. Quintilian came, riding ..hard, day and night, as he did ; and in the interval the thread-like pulse ,had returned, faint warmth had crept to the extremities, and burning heat had taken possession of the brow and head of our poor lovely one. Mr. Bouverie accompanied Dr. Quintilian to the room when he came, where I held my watch by Jasper, with kind Dr. Moore. It seems that he had explained matters (my God I) as they came along-I know not how. Dr. Quintiliatn has never even remotely alluded to the cause of his injury to me, doing his best all the time--moving around with fixed, locked features, and endeavor- ing by the exercise of efficient patience, to soothe his sufferings, and to alleviate my distress. During one of these paroxysms, not very long ago, he clasped /   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.       337' my hands, with earnest entreaties that I would be calm, and with assurances that my sorrow, my rebellious spirit, for such he thinks my grief, afflicted him more even than his child's disaster. He went on, perhaps further than he intended; but I am sure he could not measure hisswords under the state of feeling that im- pelled him to speak, and I shall try never to recall them again, nor attach to them the slightest importance; but I think I know now why he was so cold to me when he came to Bouverie. He has urged me to keep his child. How generous this is l Yes, I will keep thee, Jasper, and watch over thee with a vigi- lance worthy of the sons of light themselves, from this hour. thy life shall be my life. And oh I dark and cruel husband, by this last act of yours, you have placed an impassable- abyss be- tween us forever, here and hereafter.

O holy Virgin, sanctify and preserve me in my determination! Dr. Quintilian goes to Europe in a few days, Mr. Bouverie accompanies him-they have some scientific object in view.

He sees that I understand everything, yet he is perfectly placid and unmoved, and seems not to notice my manner. He will never ask for an explanation. It is not in his nature to do this -oh, would to God it were I Would that he could come humble and repentant from the presence of his God, to her he has so grievously crushed and offended, and make due acknowledge ments of error and of regret; so that she might dare to follow out her inclinations, and in imitation of the holy example of Jesus himself, forgive-him whom she holds dearer than her own life.

It occupies him sometimes for days, to the exclusion of everything else. During these periods the door of his library is closed,' and he takes his meals, slight as these are, alone. When he emerges, after these times of seclusion, he is very pale, and his eye wears a strange brilliancy. He passes much time too, I think, in his laboratory, connected, as -this is now by means of a door with his office, and its poisonous exhalations are telling on his delicate frame, I fear. I saw him coming from that accursed chamber, whose threshold my foot can never cross again, while life is mine, with a glass mask in his hand, yester- day I It made me shiver to look at it-that, emblem of subtile. assassination. But I hurried by without a remark, though he held it a moment before his face, intending to startle me, per- haps ; his black eyes and brilliant teeth flashing through it, as he laughed! His face rises before me in my dreams, just as I saw it then, glittering through the transparent medium, and full of frigid fire, I know not how else to describe its expression, like a wintry sun- beam through an icicle. O God I has it come to pass that I am afraid of my own husband, and that even to dream of him in some phases, makes my blood creep coldly through my veins? After such visions I sit up in my bed, covering my face with my hands, and praying half aloud; sometimes I rouse the little child sleeping beside me, that I may not feel utterly alone ; then rise and examine my door, my window, to make sure of their fastenings   .  What is it that I dread?  Nothing for myself, surely. He would never harm me, I know. No, it is all for Jasper; I fear   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        34:1 that he will not leave - his work unfinished ; I fear that my vigi- lance, even, may prove insufficient to protect lhim. When Dr. Quintilian comes, I ought, perhaps, from a sense of duty and justice to both father and child, to surrender this precious charge, that is wearing my life out-that is still almost a part of it now- yes, life itself to me I The painful and long dreaded explanation has taken place at last; I am greatly relieved. I am lost, too, in admiration of my husband's forbearance, tenderness, generosity-can I call it so? My soul has felt a strong rebound toward its old allegiance, yet the late implacability is not altogether subdued. When one has forborne and suffered in silence a long time, and at length with- drawn from an offender, it is so difficult to return I Yet there is a far better understanding now than before. It ,I occurred in this way: Bianca came to me about twilight. last evening, to say that Mr. Bouverie -wished to see me in his study. After our late dinner, I had gone to my chamber, he to his labors, as I supposed, to be separated during the whole evening. I had remarked nothing unusual in his manner during the day. Hle was still silent, and abstracted," vivacious by fits and starts only-his habit of late--yet always courteous and attentive to minor amenities even.  I did not hesitate to obey his summons- instantly, though not without trepidation, I confess. Bianca took my place by Jasper. I passed through the deserted house, the long dim hall, into the wing, and groping along its narrow entry, found the knob of the library door at last, and opened it suddenly, yet softly I suppose, for Mr. Boyiverie did not seem to notice my entrance for some tihne   842      THE HOUSEHOLD OE BOUVERTE. He was standing on the rug with his back to me when I en. tered, in an attitude denoting deep reverie or abstraction A brilliant lamp burned on the office table, the coal fire gave out its ruddy, bituminous light. The room seemed radiant, after the shadow without. I stood leaning with'one hand on the back of the great chair behind him, waiting for him to take the initiative. At last, perceiving plainly that he was unconscious of my pre- sence, I spoke to him. "Erastus, I am here," I said. "Good God, Camilla, why did you not speak before? I thought it was Gabriel who came in with coals." As he wheeled suddenly into the light, I saw that his face was agitated ; he ex- tended both hands to me, then dropped them again, as he saw that I did not observe or accept his greeting. My demeanor was frozen. I think I had trembled at first; now I was cold and reso- lute; I cannot understand why this was. His manner was surely very affecting, I had rarely seen him so shaken with emotion; mine seemed crusted with ice, I know. "Camilla," he said, after a moment's hesitation, speaking in tones of persuasive gentleness, " there is a shadow between us, who shall put it aside?" I did not reply, I scarcely knew how to answer his subtile, yet dominant, question. "I mean," he continued, after a brief pause, " whence does it fall, Camilla?" "Is there any shadow without a   substance," I murmured low. "Question for question I Well done, little Quaker," he said, with sarcastic quickness, smiling faintly as he spoke, with a flash in his eye, that betokened anything but merriment, ' I see, after   fa    THE HOUSEHOLD OF 'BOUVERIE.       343 all," he continued, " that it falls on me to open this negotiation of ours, and that you are guarded at all points." Then dropping his playful manner as suddenly as he had assumed it, he stretched forth his hands, again clasped both of mine tightly, and asked in pathetic and tender accents the ques- tion he should have put to me at first without preamble, had he understood me better. "My love I my love I what is it that divides us?", He drew me toward him as he spoke. His words, his tones thrilled me now. "Oh Bouverie!"I mur- mured, as I drooped my brow on his hands, still closely clasping    mine, "Do you not surmise the obstacle? Why ask me this vain question?" "It is, can it be that chimera still, aboutt--4bout-Jasper?" He tried to speak carelessly, but he failed; his voice was husky, and he cleared his throat impatiently-yet he overcame this, and continued speaking low. "( Be frank-be firm,'Camilla ; let me hear the worst-be not afraid of me." "Afraid of you, Erastus I Oh, that such a thing should ever be-yet how can I shape my words to be my husbandsaccuser?" I looked him full in the face now. His eye quailed, he dropped my hands and retreated from me to the mantel, against wnich he leaned, or rather clung, in silence for a time. I pitied him in- expressibly, as I saw the cold dew break over his forehead and upper lip, gemming his marble face, almost livid now, with some great internal agony. In spite of all that he had done, all that I had suffered, a feeling of respect, of tenderness even, still lingered over the ruins of my peace. I tried to appear unobservant of his condition ;, and greatly agitated myself, I sat down in .              ..    344  :    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VEIE.

"No man can bear it, and live another day I To condemn me on bare suspicion; to shape an intention from an accident, to raise a suicidal hand against your own happiness, to trample'mine to dust" "Oh, Bouverie, forbear! you know-you know I have done none of these things!"I interrupted. "So changed, too!" he pursued-" so hard, so cold now, once so true, so tender, so confiding!" I made an impatient gesture. "Who has wrought this change?"I demanded.    He did not seem to hear or heed me. "Years ago," he continued; "'years ago, when appearances were; stronger against me even than they now are, a similar phantom rose between us I How did you meet it, then? "With courage, with faith, with fidelity! Witlh a resolution that I silently admired-nay, marvelled at-you grappled with, and laid it in its grave at once, and forever. Can you not as well exorcise this demon that haunts you now? Is there none of the old leaven left, Camilla? Is love for your husband dead? That love that wrestled so nobly with the enemy of your peace, and finally, through its own constancy, triumphed over, and dis- pelled it?" "Dispelled it? no, Erastus! Triumphed over it? yes! These things are different. Yet why, if you saw all this, and felt your- self aggrieved by my suspicion, did you not speak before? Was it just, was it merciful to treat me so? Could any boon of life -have been half so dear to me, as the conviction of your innocence?   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.      345' nHas heaven, itself, a higher reward to offer, for a life of penance, than such a conviction would be to me now-hereafter?" He smiled grimly, coldly. I   "  5 Such dreams must wear away of themselves," he^aid; " or be laid to rest by the spirit that gave them birth. Mine was the wiser part ; you would not have believed me."  Even now, I will believe you," I cried, starting up before him. "If you will swear that you who are innocent-you have never deceived me in woods! The blood in your veins would recoil from nmother's'faith and mine--that you are guiltless of bloodshed in the past, of cruelty in the present-and I will believe you, Bouverie." I loosed the crucifix from my neck, and extended it to him. I- e raised his hand, then let it fall again nervelessly. . "This is child's play," he said; "put up your toy-let us talk rationally."  "I ask you for my peace, and you mock me I It is well!"I     spoke, passionately. . "Be ccalm-becalm," he commanded, waving his hand. j     "Are you quite sure, after all, that I have it in my power to repair the past, by any oath of mine?"Y he asked, mildly, after a pause.

Yet,/if you persist-hear me, Camilla." He raised his hand. "No, no," I dried, springing wildly forward. "Not that, it is too late now-spare yourself this unnecessary sin. Leave one white spot on your conscience, I entreat you. I will forego the rest." His hand had fallen while I said these words ; his eye blazed. Those were the first reproaches I had ever addressed to him; oh, bitterly I rue them already I What right have I, his wife, to add one feather to the burden that must rest on his remorseful head? What right have I to probe his wounds, to tamper with his consciende? There was a long silence, during part of which he continued standing before me, I had resumed my seat; then slowly leaving his position, he commenced pacing the room with measured steps, his hands behind him, his head cast down, almost on his breast, his face half concealed from observation by his sweeping hair. I turned illvoluntarily, and followed him as if my eyes had been fascinated. How stately, how elegant he seemed-stepping so lightly, so evenly, to and fro--so firmly too, as though he could tread down every obstacle in life, as he has trodden down every scruple! What a princely bearing he has I What a distinguished mien I What intellectual power breathes all about him I Yet, all this splendor is sullied by -" one little spot." Suddenly he stopped by the study table, and extending his hand, took up the gold snuff-box he always keeps beside him, and smelt its contents through the half parted lid, then spoke with gaiety. "I shall come to the royal habit by and by," he said. "Camilla, did you know that all kings take snuff?"   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVAtIE.        347 I started at the strangely irrelevant question. "So do inquisi- tors," he added, smiling, and advancing toward me with a glitter in his eye, "Pray, have a pinch!" I understood his sarcasm, but took no notice of it, his levity gave me such exquisite pain, on his own account. He turned and deposited the box on the mantel, against which he leaned again, with folded arms. , "So you would play the part of angel to my Mahomet-eh I Camilla, and wring the black drop from   my heart, would you? Ah I my child, wait until your wings are grown. Do not unsphere yourself, you are but-mortal yet, however beau- tiful." "Erastus," I said, " sneer as you will, my words have touched your soul; yet if they have been undue, forgive them. I shall not repeat the offence."  He seemed softened, a tremor ran over his flexible features.. "You have'been hard on me, Camilla, in more ways than one. - Hard in judgment, hard in act; yet whatever may be the truth- as concerns your suspicions of me, how have I injured you person- ally, that you should rise up against me an avenging Nemesis? Is it the part of a wife to sit in judgment on the husband? Is she even permitted in law to testify against him? Yet you take upon yourself both offices." He paused for a reply. I made none. I "After all, my love," he resumed, speaking again in that quivering and emotional voice, peculiar to him, when excited, and almost irresistible in its pathos. "After all, my love, despite appearances, despite reality even, admitting both to be true, for the sake of argument merely,!s there no such thing as for. givenless possible with you? Hve you no mercy, Camilla?"   348      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. Again he approached me and clasped my hands, looking long into my face, then mutely raising my fingers to his lips, he kissed them many times, fervently. I felt his hot tears falling on my hands. They stirred,.me strangely. They were. the first I had ever known him to shed. I started to my feet. I spoke pas- sionately. "Forgiveness I Oh, do not ask this of me I The holy Saviour, the mighty Father, the intermediating Saints and Virgin, it is of them you should ask forgiveness. Pour out your heart to our beloved Bishop Clare, he who joined our hands in sacred mar- riage, who feels so deeply for us both, and take his counsel, what- ever that may be. Do this and you will be happy again, Erastus ; but my forgiveness, what could that avail? "Much, much,' he murmured, " more than all beside." He was kneeling before me now, he so haughty, so unbending usually, his head buried in my lap, like that of a little child. He was shaken ,with a storm of weeping. After awhile he said, lift- ing his head again, speaking in supplicating accents- "I must have your forgiveness first, then I will be strong to seek divine favor. Tell me, Camilla, that all shadows are put aside, that you pardon me, love me again-are mine?' I could not tell him this, I have grown so hard, so inflexible, of late, I fear. I sat in tearful silence. He mistook its cause, pro- bably, for, throwing his arms around me, he drew me closely, suddenly to his breast. I shuddered irresistibly. It was but a little tremor, quick to come and quick to go--one of those chills we feel, it is said, when a foot passes over the place where our grave shall be--yet he marked it. His arms relaxed, he rose, he turned away, and took a distant .chair. When he looked at me again I saw that his face wore that air of haughty indifference, I 1   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE        349 had caught by glimpses of its expression when he paced the floor, ,agd again I shivered. I lknew that I had acted unwisely, but I could not feign. I sat in silence.  "You are implacable, Camilla," he said, at length; "this even- ing has been wasted in pursuit of a vain shadow; I cannot fathom a nature like yours, I have not known you thoroughly-- though so long " He waved his hand. "Go, my love," he said, "I will not keep you longer from- Jasper." He coughed impatiently, and slightly stamped his foot, then rose and touched the bell. The attendant answered its summons instantaneously, as if starting from the floor.  I mroved slowly, somewhat indignantly toward the door, thus loftily dismissed.  "Gabriel," he added, "liglit your mistress across the corridor. Madam, good night." He bowed with a deep mocking deference, that I knew of old I was glad to find myself once more alone, and secure, in my own chamber.        i. Another partly painful scene with Mr. Bouverie I This morn- ing, when I went into the breakfast-room, I found Erastus writing. When our meal was concluded, he handed me the letter to read, on which he had been cegaged. It was addressed to Dr. Luther Quintilian. I found, to my surprise, that it contained a courteous request that he would make his arrangements as speedily as pos sible, to remove Jasper, alleging as a reason, that my health was .       350      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. giving way under the continuous care required of me, and thatit was his intention to travel with me, for its benefit. He recom. mended Chapel Hill, as a suitable asylum for Jasper, should it not be convenient to dispose of him otherwise. "Jasper at Chapel Hill!"I said, indignantly; "Jasper, a mute, an infant still, scarcely four years old I 'What would become of him there in that vortex of boys? Paul himself found it hard work to get along with them at eleven. What could this poor baby do?" I could not help shedding tears at the very thought. "No," I said, "I will not give him up until Luther comes in person to demand him of me. Then he shall receive back the wreck of what he brought so nobly beautiful; until that time comes I will maintain the duty that circumstances have rendered doubly imperative, that the hand of misfortune has sealed so sacredly now." He eyed me with sarcastic bitterness. '"Suppose it should not suit me to wait the advent of Luther? Suppose I use my authority and send Jasper to Chapel Hill, what then, Camilla?" ' I will go, too," I answered stolidly. "No, you will go with me, Camilla," he remarked, calmly, "should I desire it; you are too dutiful a wife, I know, to stand in open rebellion against. your husband." "You have forgotten," I'said, " or repudiated the opinions you once uttered, when you said that Bernadotte owed everything' tc Sweden, when choice lay between his allegiance to the country of his adoption and to his benefactor, who wished him to destroy, after giving to his care, that people. This is a case inr point; I admired the sentiments you expressed on that occasion so much that I have adopted them as my code of action from that time,   THE 1IOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        351 - Daty to our dependents is 'the highest of all duties," you averred, ' and its fulfillfment allies us nearer than any other to-our -Maker. He who shrinks from a responsibility of this kind is unworthy to live.' These were your words, Erastus." "I recollect them well," he rejoined, with a grim smile. "I went further," he added, "I attacked the legend of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac as too unnatural to be true, or, if true, too craven to have met with, or deserved God's favor. Do you i  remember this, also, Camilla?" I "I do,' I replied ; "but I deemed it unnecessary to reply to such irreverence on your part, however nobly conceived the sen- timent might have been. I try to remember only those things that place you in the most favorable light, Erastus." "Strange, dutiful forbearance I you do not always succeed, however, it seems; I thank you, though, for the effort. In the meantime, I agree with your sagacious and novel remark of the other night, ' That no shadow falls without a suggestive sub- stance.' In accordance with this conviction I propose, for your own sake, and mine, if not for his own,-to remove Jasper." I gasped, I grew faint. His eye sparkled, he fixed it on me, he sneered, laughed in- wardly, extended his hand for the letter I still held, took it, raised it a moment before his eyes, as if skimming its contents, then, as if relenting, suddenly thrust it into the grate.  The act affected me, not more, however, than the rapid and ulnaccountable change in his features and expression. These were now profoundly sad, and subdued, as he 'stood, looking into the fire, watching' the last filmy, elements of the paper dissolve m flame. "No more of this, no more despotism," he murmured, as if ;,.."                 - . .- -  "    352'      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVYERIE. speaking unconsciously aloud, " it, is ot in this way men get back the love of women, yet how regain the inestimable treasure when once lost? Who shall teach me this lesson?" "Let me be your instructor. Oh, my husband!"I said, clinging to his hand, which I had taken, and which, for a moment, he struggled to withdraw. "Yo taught me once, letje be your teacher now." I felt his fingers close over mine like steel. "And what will you teach me, little philosopher, special pleader, persuasive preacher that you are, that you have not taught me long ago?"' '  H ie smiled with sudden sweetness, and stooping, kissed my brow. "To be patient," I said, "with me, your patient, for I am sick, Erastus-soul-sick, perhaps, yet none the less entitled to your charity; help me to repair the past, be kind to our mother: l!    less mute one,-let me continue a little longer my ministry to him, be tender, 'be forbearing to me, your suffering wife, and we shall be happy again.  Yes, happier than before." "Be it as you desire," he said, " my wife, too well beloved for my own peace of mind, perhaps ; yet tremble, Camilla," he added, gravely, "lest God bring you to a fuller sense of your depen- dence on your husband yet, in his own way, in his own time." I did tremble, involuntarily, as he spoke these low, deep, pro- phetic words, in his stern, impressive manner. Yet my determina- tion was unshaken to carry out my task, and to wait for his evidenced repentance, before taking up the old clue of life again, followed in blind despair so long, so faithfully. I have discerned in myself, at last, an inflexibility of character that repels me almost from my own nature I Is this hard, cold, implacable being, the same  Camilla Byrne, so tender, so impas- sioned once, so gay, so universally confiding? Alas, for change!   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VCEIE.       353 Nfarch. After three months passed in shadow, what joy it is to be per- nmitted to write again, to resume occupation of any sort I I have H been threatened with blindness, a lot I have ever dreaded more than death itself, or even insanity. I have not been able to dis- tinugish the features of any face around me distinctly until now, since my first attack, and there were times when even the outlines of forms and objects were merged in the surrounding greyness. I seemed to be groping in everlasting twilight. Colors were extinguished, and the strongest rays of sunshine resembled the struggling beams of moonlight as seen through a hazy cloud. Forms came and weit like phantoms, and a miserable bewilder- ment possessed my brain. Dr. Moore thinks this changing color of mine betokens too strong an inclination of blood to the head, so he has bled me copiously. But to this treatment Mr. Bouverie sternly objects, and will not suffer it to be repeated. He consented only to the use of a tonic draught-alternated with one of a depleting nature, and I have received my medicine from his attentive band alone, during my whole sickness. His ministry has indeed been most kind and constant, by night and day. Anticipating my wishes, my anxieties, he gave Jasper to Bianca's care, and occupied himself solely with me. While I lay in that dark bondage, all he could do to soothe, to cheer me- was earnestly attempted. He- gave up his valuable correspon- dence-extinguished the fires of his laboratory-laid by his books. All this for the sake of the wife who shuddered, a little while ago, at his touch-L-his embrace! He has not forgotten this; evidently, with all his tenderness- and there is, a delicacy in his ministry that renders it doubly deal.   35^    'THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. O And now, that I can see clearly again-who rejoices with me as  he rejoices? He lingers about me watchfully, tenderly, waiting  hopefully, now I perceive plainly, for old feelings to reassert them- E selves in my breast.  I thank him-I bless him for all this ; yet, the time is not yet  despite my gratitude. Why did he permit the fire to burn down  to ashes? COh, why was I constituted as I am-inexorable?  Yet this trial was good for me, perhaps-,wisely bestowed by a  chastening hand, and those prophetic words that thrilled me so, when spoken by Erastus, are proved at last.  I have been clearly shown my dependence on my husband, I have been shown much more. The unacknowledged beauty and  blessing of my life, with all its surroundings of taste and comfort,  over which the curtain of darkness was flung for a time, as if to  make me recognize its loveliness at last, with a heart full of praise - and humility, is made plain to me now.  Am   I not called upon, too, by the pressure, and by the lifting E of this rod, to avow my presumption in judging so harshy of my  husband's acts?  Have I been in error, or too precipitate?

It was full of malignant laughter. "Dr. Moore is an oracle," he said, in scoffing accents, and turned away.   THlIE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VEITE.      355  I dropped the subject, but my heart sank inwardly. I had so hoped for a change in him, radical, deep-searching; something that would repress in future all demonstrations of this -kind I I scarcely know why this slight incident (if such it may be called)  has made such an impression on me.  Let mie record here some notice of my symptoms, which may be useful to me-though I hope not-for reference at another  time, should this dark disease recur.  A night of deep lethargy preceded my first attack. I awoke, as I thought, before daylight, with pain in my head and eyes, ac- companied with giddiness. I did not see Bianca, who was stand- ing at the foot of my bed, for some time-and after all, only as a  greyr shadow. Yet, it was then past eight o'clock, and the  window-blinds were open, and the room flooded with sunshine, as she told me. When the truth became manifest to me, I was  greatly terrified-greatly stricken. The physician was promptly callel-d-remedies used to reduce my condition, which my blood-  shot eyes seemed to make necessary ; yet, it was nearly two weeks before I began to see again, with anything like clearness.  Then supervened another deep slumber-another blind awaken- ing-another fortnight of darkness and bewilderment, and so  through the whole three months, the disease continued to manifest itself, until at last, as by a merciful hand, it was slowly lifted  away I Bishop Clare arrived just after my last seizure, and shared Mr.  Bouveries vigils by my side with- prayer added to patience,  I cannot help thinking that his devout intercession- in my behalf has had its effect.

What a devoted, unfailing friend he has I been to me I But now, all is joy and happiness, and wild delight even, in my heart. I am bound up, to the exclusion of alLelse in this newly- recovered sense of mine, and all that it gives back to me. I can see Jasper's beautiful face again, and grasp his meaning  from its speaking expression. I can see the tender green of grass and shrub, that seem to be making haste to greet me, in this for- ward spring. Crocus, and snowdrop, and periwinkle, and flower i ing almond, and budding peach, all wear a beauty not their own E -not earthly. Paradise seems opening before me in the smiling face of nature, and my feelings overflow witlh kindness to all God's creatures, i from the little snow-white lambs in tae pasture, to the poor gob-  lin child of the kitchen hearth, that sits listlessly with its fingers m its slavering mouth all day, and whines like a whipped puppy. When I drive out, I find myself greeting common acquaintances as if we had been parted for years, and I feast my eyes on the dear faces of Erastus and Bishop Clare-the last so soon to leave us again-with joy and gratitude. Paul's letters had accumulated during my blindness ; I have been reading them all over with such pleasure. It is not the same thing, I think, to hear a friend's letter read, even by a silvery voice, as to trace the dear handwriting with you own eyes, , and mark its very inequalities as expressive of changing feel. ing.

The impassible horror of the perfect features is some- thing beyond description with all its twisted snakes wreathing around the stately heroic head I But a new impression is now added to the old. r It seems to me that something of this fabled nature has entered into my being, and I accept it almost as a type of the past. I cannot conquer my aversion for this beautiful horror I                              e Sculpture has a much more powerful influence over me than painting. I have wished for nothing so much as to see the grand     statues of antiquity. I am sorry dear Paul does not enter more vividly into the inspiration of those old masters. One of his re- marks appears to'me very significant of his whole appreciation of art; yet it made me laugh, and may have been intended as enthusiastic. He observed of the Apollo Belvidere, that grandest of all shapes, undeniably, that it reminded him " of a boy who had slung a pebble at a bird, and hit him!" He considered it the embodiment of the word " success." But what a quaint illustration I Advices from Russia declare thel Crown securely fixed on the head of Nicholas . He was crowned in December, .and renews his brother's offers to Mr. Bonverie.

We are to go first to England and Scotland to visit Mr. Bouverie's relatives in both places. The first, very distinguished people of distant consanguinity, connected with him on his mother's side ; the last, of the true blood of Bouverie, honorable but poor. These consist of Madame Ambrose, who still survives, contrary to my impression, and her beautiful young adopted daughter, a near relative of hers. They have a romantic resi- dence called "Les Bocages," in the neighborhood of the lakes, and are highly cultivated persons, as he represents them. Madame Ambrose, old Uncle Bouverie's half sister, married a French gentleman of family who lost all in the Revolution, and left her in indigence, from which her own exertions rescued her. She is, of course, a very aged woman. She is said to have been excessively beautiful. When we reach Paris I shall place Jasper in his father's hands; I may then, perhaps, think more earnestly than now of resuming my old allegiance. Let me first rest assured that the penitence of Erastus is real and enduring. The stains must be purged from my husband's hands before I can clasp them again with the olden confiding affection. Alas! alas I that perished long ago, and a mere phantom replaced it, conjured from the depths of my fidelity. Will the merciful Creator see fit to restore the past? Shall the gift of perfect love, in which there is no fear, ever crown our home again? All things are possible to him, I will not despair, and, for my part, I would be willing to be blind again, for life-what greater sacrifice could be demanded?-to have back my faith in Bouverie.

I can imagine his writhing lip, his blazing eye, and the cold drops of dew gemming his Jivid face. I wish that I had been there to see! Dr. Moore must have been surprised at the effect, of his mission too, for he knew nothing either of the contents of the letter or the significance of the wire. One person only knows, that is Bianca ; I told her all on the morning after the occurrence, and she helped me faithfully to carry out my plan.  Well as she knew him before, she was overwhelmed with the intelligence of his latest prank of cruelty, of perfidy. How he has luxuriated of late in his favorite elements!

I do not like his face-it is almost fearful to me; yet, if he does his work well, why should I mind this? Besides, may I not be wholly morbid now-bitter and high-strung as I feel? Will anything ever appear fair and pleasant to me again, except that little face that knows no guile ; sealed into dumbness through his act forever? He thought to the last I would go with him, did he? He did not know that he had created his match at last, not met it merely. He did not know, that from his own failure, to deceive, had risen a spirit of deceit, even stronger than his own. A power to conceal, to endure, of which he even has no capacity. I had no idea I had such nerve, such capabilities of treason and treachery?  Did I not say somewhere in this Diary, "I could not feign?" What a weak creature I was in those days--how contemptible in my goody goodiness I Stay-how many years ago was it that I wrote these words. Only six weeks-only! Why--have not these been years!-years I Oh,- God I have pity on me I Appearances were kept up to the last. We out-charlataned the charlatan.

He saw nothing of it, I am convinced, and so to the end he believed I would go with him. It was essential to the pre- servation of my life itself, perhaps, to. cheat him thus. When at last he could linger no longer, having, as I well knew, business of importance in Philadelphia to transact, before we could take the packet of the twentieth-when he found that my preparations were not completed, he yielded readily to my suggestion, that we could go down later, with Dr. Moore, so as to reach the packet in time. I never said that I would go with Dr. Moore-nor that I would join him in Philadelphia. I only urged the feasibility of the plan. From the time I discovered his treachery I measured my words, so as to tell no falsehood, yet to leave the impression I desired. Strange sophistry, worthy of my teacher! So he went away, believing fully that I would follow him-and Dr. Moore believed it, too, to the last. Had a bolt fallen at his feet he could not have appeared more astonished than when I gave him my-letter, and looking upon him with clear, unblinded eyes, told him I had renounced the voyage I He tried to elicit an explanation. I would give him none, and as he was obliged to make the journey on his own account, he  consented unwillingly enough, I saw, to convey the letter, and the small scroll containing the brass wire, to Mr. Bouverie. He  doubted his reception, I imagine. He has not yet returned, but when he does, his satisfaction on the subject will not be greater, perhaps, than it now is. I may lose his friendship in con- sequence of this. I hope not. It has been a solace to me through many years. His kindness, in a medical point of view, I never   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.      363  can forget, nor his disinterested zeal for my health and welfare  in the past and present. Yet, I can make no explanations. All this while I linger from my record.            l It was on the night of the 10th or 12th of April-I forget which-that the scales fell from my eyes, never to veil them again, and the soul of Erastus Bouverie was disclosed to me in all its hideousness, and I saw into the depths of hell. I had an attack of pain, I remember; one of those spasms of the heart to which I am rather subject, but which always pass away without any remedy,  On that occasion, Mr. Bouverie insisted upon it {hat I should try a draught he knew how to prepare, especially suited to these attacks. I had eaten my supper and felt disinclined for medicine ;  but when we parted at bedtime, I consented to take it with. me to my chamber. He could not prevail upon me to drink it then, in his presence, which I know now he desired that I should do  for reasons of his own. -So I carried it off in a slender Venetian' glass he kept for his own especial use.               i When I had undressed myself, and was ready for bed, I stood on the hearth a moment, poising the draught between my eyes and the niglt-lamp; I saw that there was sediment in the bottom    of the glass. The odor of the draught was pleasant; but when I tasted it, which I barely did, without disturbing the sediment,  ^ I found it pdhmeated with the same peculiar flavor that I so dis-  tinctly remembered as having lingered on my palate on the night  of my,first seizure, after drinking my coffee.             I had been seized soon after supper that night with-slight giddi-    364      THEI HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.  ness and nausea; had gone to bed at my husband's solicitation ; slept heavily, and awakened blind. Some instinctive misgivings seemed to possess me, associated with. this recurring flavor, no doubt. I shaped no suspicions, entertained none ; acted from intuitive impul- ses alone, when I emptied the draught in the hearth, and setting the glass back on the mantelpiece, turned quietly toward the bed.  Jasper was sleeping. I knelt before the "Prie Dieu," and gave up my soul to prayer. When I went to bed, half an hour later, all thought of the pain I had suffered (but of a few moments' duration) or of the draught my husband had prepared, was put aside, as completely as if these things had never existed. I had fastened the door and window-blinds according to custom; the taper was left burning on the. hearth.- In a few minutes I was fast asleep. I was awakened by thepresence of some moist, soft substance on my eyelids. Before I could speak, a sharp shock seemed to pass through the balls, while a flash,. as if from lightning, blazed before them ; revealing nothing, however. The thought that I was lightning-struck, passed through my brain with instantaneous swiftness. I shrieked, and throwing out my arms, they came in contact with a hard substance, which in the next moment' fell crashing to the- floor. For an instant I saw the scene before me. Mr. Bouverie, with his face averted, stood near the bed, clinging to the post. In another moment all was darkness ; I lay quite still, almost para- lyzed by terror, as well as physical causes. I knew from the cautious noise, I heard, however, that he was gathering up the instrument he had dropped (or its fragments), whatever that might be. I drew the bedclothes softly over Jasper's head, and awaited the issue.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        365 A few monlents later I heard the door close ; his steps had been inaudible as he gained it. I was afraid to believe that he was really gone ; and, after all, might he not return? Oh, God I those weary hours! Day broke at last, and showed me that I was not blind, only left in darkness by the extinguishing of the taper. Jasper awoke ; Bianca came ; I told her everything. The carpet spotted in many places by the acid employed ; the discovery of some 'small pieces of a broken glass column; a bit of brass wire, and a moistened sponge, evidenced the late presence of a galvanic battery in the chamber. I knew too well the fatal accompaniments I, had often watched, of old Mr. Bouverie's experiments with the Voltaic pile.              .  It is probable that these legacies of his visit were not sus- pected by the author of evil, since he had gathered together in darkness all fragments within his reach, and borne them away when he left the room; yet small as these remaining remnants were, they brought to my mind conclusive proof of what I should have suspected, even had they not been found, for I had some ex- perience from one electric experiment to which I had been sub- mitted, for the sake of nervous headache, of the- glare that accom- panies a galvanic shock, when applied near the region of the     i optical nerve.                ' - Later, I found on a piece of crumpled paper, thrown down on the laboratory floor, and burnt at the edges, a:s if the fire had    been its original destination, which Bianca' brought to me, some memoranda connected with my malady and its causes.          : The administration of various drugs,in combination with the galvanic shocks, had done the work. My dilated pupils, which      aroused Dr. Moore's suspicions of amaurosis, were the work of   , ;  f        .    ..   366      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUJVERiE. "belladonna ;" .my nervous prostration, of "digitalis ;" my profound slumbers, of " black drop," and " morphine.7 These were administered by turns in the draught Dr. Moore had ordered. The nauseous taste of the poppy was that which I had perceived predominating last, and remembered as clinging to my palate after'drinking the coffee that contained it, a flavor of- which I had n6 experience, and this Mr. Bouverie knew, never having met with it before in illness even. My resolution was taken at once, and communicated to Bianca ; I would feign blindness ; the wires had been applied too high, fortunately, this time, to insure such a result, and a mere dimness of vision, in one eye, was the only inconvenience I experienced ; I would remain in bed for the present, but she should sleep in my chamber henceforth, with Jasper, and watch, over us both unfail- ingly, until the time came for the European voyage.  I had already consented to go ; I would not withdraw that con- sent until the last moment ; I would refuse all medicine as having been unavailing before, and partake only of such food as she should bring me. At one time -we thought of adding bolts to the door and window ; but this we felt could not pass unobserved, and would only arouse suspicion. The means by which Mr. Bouverie unlocked my door were certainly very mysterious ; the key remained in the key-hole, and was made to do its own office, both as he came in and went out, for Bianca found the door locked in the morning from within. I noticed that the venetian glass, which had contained the draught, and which I had replaced in the usual manner, on the maneitl- piece, after emptying it, had been turned mouth downward, after the habit of Mr. Bouverie-thoughtlessly, no doubt, in his excite- ment ; and this proved to me how closely he had examined its   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVRIE.        367 contents ere he proceeded to experiment on me. . He had satisfied himself evidently that I had drank the draught, before venturing to approach my bed. Nothing now remained for us but vigilance, caution, cunning, and duplicity. All very difficult to me, very foreign from my character, as they were, and very repulsive to every principle of my life.' For Bianca these were probably easier. She was a diplomatist by nature-not frank, though communica- tive, and fond of stratagem, yet faithful and devoted beyond any one I have ever known. Watchful, too, and suspicious to an excess, she was well calculated for the post I had assigned her. Let me pass over that fearful interval of conflicting horror and indignation, when I was obliged to submit to the subdued caresses of a monster. He came to me as before, with his slow, soft step, and silvery accents, sat by my bed, chafing my nerveless fingers in his own, read to me books whose words I never istened to, hour after hour, patiently, unmeaningly. It was easy to palliate this new whim of mine, to have Bianca and Jasper in my room, at night, on the plea of his own health, somewhat broken, as I insisted on believing it to have been, by his long nocturnal vigils by-my side during my last attack. It was easy, too, to deceive him, as to any suspicions I might have entertained, or been supposed to en- tertain-when I shrieked and threw out my hands; so as to upset the battery-by a show of frankness, calculated to dispel his doubts  - on this subject, if any such existed. "I thought I saw a glare in my room, as of lightning, before   . I sank int6 lethargy," I said, " yet Bianca says there was no     i thunder-storm ; I must have imagined this."

"I am resolved to take no more medicine until we go abroad." "The form is necessary, however," he replied, " to-to-avert suspicion." "What suspicion?"I asked, keenly excited by his strange remark ; "to what do you allude? What suspicion could be aroused in this case, that you seek to allay?         .

I am not what I was. I am cold, hard, defiant, mocking, skep-  tical almost. When Bishop Clare comes again, what shall I say    to him? How explain this change? How acknowledge that I cannot pray? I must not-I will not reveal its cause; and he will accuse me mentally, if not openly, of inconsistency, caprice, faint-heartedness.

BOUVERIE., ERASTUS: I have been resolved since the night of which this brass wire -is a memorial, not to go to Europe with you-never to live with you again. I have no reproaches to offer you; I believe you have only acted out your nature, like any other serpent. When you attacked the citadel of sight, you struck at some- thing dearer than life, or reason itself. Was it in this way you sought to regain the affection you had lost; or, did you mean only to enslave me? In either case, I can forgive you on one condition, that we never meet again. My small estate will suffice-to support me in comfort-no act'of mine shall ever make you blush. So put aside all care for me from this moment, and believe in the inflexibility of my resolution.  That you may still know repentance, and through that means true happiness, is the prayer of the-no longer blind,  CAMLLA BOUVERIE. Saib is dead, and Gabriel has run off I Two events that have more connection with each other than might appear on the surface. The devotion of this negro to the fierce black horse was some-  thing unparalleled. He preferred sleeping in his stable to   occupying the comfortable quarters assigned to him, and after Sahib grew blind, he spent all of his leisure hours in summer-time, I in keeping the flies from annoying him, with a discarded peacock   brush, once in use about the table. .

A year ago, when on his return from Russia, finding him useless, Mr. Bouverie prepared to shoot Sahib, Gabriel threw himself before the horse, like Poca- hontas between Captain Smith and his executioner, and efftreated for his life. - It was granted, on conditions that have been religiously fulfilled. There was no attachment existing between Gabriel and his master, I knew, and yet Mr. Bouverie controlled him, as no one else could do, without a blow or a loud word. Some great fear seemed at the bottom of this spaniel-like obedience; but what it arose from I could never learn. It may have been a sort of magnetism. It surprised me the more, therefore, that Gabriel had the hardihood and, generosity to intercede so earnestly for the life of Sahib. I did think, I confess, that Gabriel had a linger. ing, perhaps an inherited attachment for me, and never imagined such a thing -probable as his flight. But after all, the poor creature was sorely-tempted possibly, and the mirage of the negro, called freedom, which only means in most -cases, the permis- sion to steal and starve, lured him on. I shall make no effort to secure him. He was, unmanageable at times, though good- natured, and always disagreeable to Bianca. As I am situated, I can dispense hereafter with the services of a footman. Poor Mr. Grant, how I miss him I He was staunch as steel to our interests, and had a leal Scottish heart, in his bosom, better than any other, I believe, when truly attached. I am glad that he left no family to lament him.

THE  IIOUSEHOLD OF BOUVJSIE.      373 Smith's wife has arrived. She certainly excels as a laundress; * but her appearance is unprepossessing. He, too, has a face that   1 makes me recoil, yet he does his work well-and understands  the culture of the vegetable garden, from which, hereafter, I must try;to derive some money. The farm-hands are to board as before, during harvest and seed-time, in his family. I hope I shall be able to get along with these strangers, by keeping them at a  distance from my household. But nobody can replace Mr. Grant. The long-long  summer-days wear away so dolefully. I  occupy myself as much as I cali with Jasper, who improves daily, ) ,  and is my sole consolation now, and with the details of my house- keeping, which have become a second nature, used as. I have been to the ordering of a family, since my poor mother died-and Uncle Bouverie put his keys in my childish hand-too small to grasp them.  I read too, and sew, and work among my flowers-and I have  opened the long-silent piano, and tried its chords again. But the  ; spirit of music that abode with' me once has gone, and the jang-  ling keys seemed to mok me, with their piercing discord. The    1 instrument is one they called a harpsichord, I believe, and was the  property of Aunt Bouverie, who played well. For her sake, I will have it repaired, and keep it henceforth in order. I am sorry that Jasper evidences little fondness for music,  1 as this might be in his case a wonderful resource. Nature designed him, I think, for a painter. i His childish efforts to draw are astonishing. He begins to read fluently now, and occupies  himself, principally, with illustrated books, of which he -possesses  a quantity.             -   \,                 I tt 374      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. He is enchanted with .the plates in Wilson's new worlk on "Ornithology." I am alone. Strive as I may to put them aside, those mourn- ful words are ever ringing in the depths of my nature. The momentary fierceness of my anger that sustained me for a time is over, and I awake to the full sense of my desolation. Letters from Paul announce his speedy return. He is the only person in the world that I would be glad to see just now, always excepting Bishop Clare, who cannot come until the approaching month. Yet even with him there may occur a cold restraint, founded on the uncomprehended past. With Pail there can be nothing of this kind. He will ask me  no questions. He will suspect nothing. My domestic habits and my care for Jasper, will appear reason enough for changing my plan of European travel. Yet he will not content himself here, of course. lie must go to a city and begin his career of physician. It is quite time he was taking some step in life.

I have had a very long and artistic letter from Mr. Bouverie. It is dated "July, Les Bocages." He is the guest of his aunt, Madame Ambrose, with whom he is to remain until her ward; is mnarried.  ,    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        371 I see that the marriage will occur now in a few days. He  does not mention the young lady's name, but says she is to marry     young Edward de Qourcy, a distant relative of hers, and the heir  to the fine estate called "Taunton Tower," in the vicinity of  Madame Ambrose.  He speaks of her as a very beautiful person, with one slight personal drawhack, which he does not mention, and says that her age is just that of our daughter, had she survived-sixteen in September last.  A h, that is too young to be married. Judgmnient is dormant at    that age. Fancy rules. Early marriages are seldom the hap-  piest. Yet circumstances may render such a step advisable in  her -case-the age of her protector, her own friendless and secluded position. Her fate reminds me -of my own. But why      ; should I feel the slightest interest in this foreign girl, whose face I shall never see? I cannot tell. My loneliness perhaps gives  my mind room to act, on every fresh subject presented to it, with  unreasonable power. The thought of this young bride is haunt-  ing me with a sort of fascination.  Had we parted in the fullness of conjugal confidence, Mr. Bouverie's letter could not have been more tender, more affec-  tionate. He simply refers to mine, and its allusions, as having -   been hastily conceived and written.

Nay, more, you trembled before me, you, whose affection was all I desired, and so there grew up between us a vague unhappiness that ripened and bore bitter fruit. The climax came at last, I need not remind you how-or when, yet no words of mine could convey to your mind a  tithe of my suffering under this condition of affairs.

I was not born under the influence of the dog- star, that is certain. I am thin, and weak, and pale, and have lost power to eat or sleep with any regularity. Bishop Clare is greatly concerned at my condition, I can see, yet he asks no questions. I have volunteered no confession on this occasion. He waits evidently for me td suggest such a neces- sity. Another time, I hope to please him better. I am extremely nervous, highstrung, in all my sensations. I hear so acutely that my ear opens even to a cat's footsteps. I cannot bear the light, but linger all day in the shadow. Jasper even makes more noise than I can well endure, and the monotonous insect-sounds of mid- summer fall on my senses crushingly. The buzing of the blue fly in the window panes, the booming- of the beetle as he strikes at irregular intervals against the ceiling, the chirping of the locust, or the katydid, in the near shrubbery, and worse than all, the croaking of the frogs from the lake at evening, Annoy and depress me, indescribably, unreason- ably. I said to Bishop Clare the other day, a I believe I am just in a condition now to be magnetized ; I never was before ; every do- minant sound seelns to me a law of my being; every ray of light a struggleor mastery. I could be governed very readily now by any energetic cause. "Ah, Camilla," he observed, shaking his head, " you are mis- taken, I have never known a more indomitable nature." Even he blames me for not accompanying Mr. .Bouverie I I see it plainly. Where is his boasted charity?

Bishop Clare does not hesitate to say that some of her revelations  have shocked and astonished him greatly, I have never known him before to refer ever so slightly to the confession of a penitent. I am  convinced there is a struggle in his breast, on this subject, in which conscientious scruples and religious fidelity wage war-man and priest, in other words. I cannot help thinking that her mysterious absence has been accounted for at last, and that it was connected   ] with the perpetration of some hitherto unacknowledged crimer My prejudice against her may, however, lie at the root of this  suspicion. I have no wish to know the truth, no curiosity on the subject, little interest in her, in any way, yet when she is gone what a burden the poor idiot will become to me I For the sake of charity, though, I must keep him, and care for him. I grow strangely cold and indifferent, I fear, to every duty. These seem merely mechanical to me- now-I was so zealous once in their  discharge I The-burning drought lies heavily over the land. The evening sun has a lurid light. The earth looks to me, as I have imagined it might do, when the end of all approached. I sit up half the night gazing, gazing out upon the stars, without a dig- tinct idea, wrapped in' a miserable dream. I wish I could feel more acutely, even if I suffered more, and that physical sensibility  had not absorbed mental activity. Pray heaven this mood may pass.  August Sth,      - I know that something strange and fearful has occurred. I       know that the scene I witnessed in my sleep never took place on  earth ; but is an indication to me, of the progress through which   'n ' . ,',   38  '-   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVErIE.  an infant's spirit passes after death-and of the growth, physical and mental both, that goes on even among the angels. What else, if not this, could that strange vision mea-t-so fear- fully distinct, that, daylight could show me' no. object more per- ceptible or certain than it revealed? And why, if some accident has not befallen him, was my hus- band mingled in this dream of another world? He is dead, and in spite of all I have suffered at his hands, my heart is broken by this conviction. I never before connected the idea of death with him-so powerful, so efficient, as he seemed-rso imperish- able almost--such a being of steel and fire I To see him no '] more I Oh, no I that was not the same thing. C '  But, perhaps, my impetuous fancy goes beyond the mark. Perhaps, my own mind suggested a portion of that dream, and so supplied fuel for its own flame. Perhaps he lives-repents, may still be purified, and that peace and joy may still be ours in heaven I But there is much of this vision grounded on truth, that never came from within, and the wonderful gates of' Paradise-the Jasper gates have been opened to me, a mortal, perhaps, in my slumber, through the mercy of the holy and benevolent Virgin- the friend of all desolate women. Or has my soul gone forth a lonely voyager on the waves of space-and sought these scenes, led by a guardian angel? It is all mystery, yet nothing could surpass'the reality-the novelty, the impressiveness of this vision. I am convinced that 1 have seen my daughter, as she is now in Paradise, with the strange companion, who seems her guardian ther--and that if my hus- band be not dead, he too, has been graciously permitted to be.  hold our child, through the medium Of a vision. May it prove the commencement of his redemption.   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        381 - MY VISION, I thought I saw a slender, beautiful maiden dressed in white robes, and covered from head to foot in a long fleecy veil, so thin  that it revealed her fair neck and arms, and the glistening pearls that bound them, through its filmy folds. Her face was regular and calm as, that of an antique statue, enlivened only by the dark, brilliant, eyes, and clustering chestnut curls. On her fair brow and cheek burned crimson spots, as if the tips of five bloody     i fingers had lightly, yet indelibly, rested on them. And by this baptismal sign I knew my child! A young and stately man .stood beside her, supporting her it seemed, fair-haired, blue-eyed, frank of face, rather than handsome. His figure was only partly visible, for it seemed in my vision that a cloud had parted to reveal a few figures among a crowd, that it otherwise wholly enveloped, seen as these were, as through filmy. smoke. But distinct among all these more distant shapes-as if in another reft of the cloud-I saw my husband., He stood with his    : arms folded, collected, pale, serene, strikingly handsome as lie  ' always is, and dressed with extreme care in his usual attire of  .  speckless black. Presently, a, heavy vapor gathered over the whole scene and swallowed it from my sight, and I awoke. The figure of my daughter-for I clings to the idea that this was   , she-was so distinct, that had I been an artist, I could have painted her portrait from the vivid impression it left behind. Oh, what a wondrous revelation to an earthly and -heart-stricken mother, is an angel child I  What is thy name in heaven-oh, my child?  Whom callest      l thou mother, there?

Speak to me-let me hear thee as well as behold thee l I am possessed by this strange vision-it clings around me with wonderful tenacity--and the common incidents of life pass un- noticed since I have dreamed it. I must have slept'very lightly while it was passing through my brain, for I heard the thunder rolling without all the time, and the rain pouring against the panes. The first great storm we have had this month was raging then. I have told my dream to Father Clare. He is very grave. I have never seen him so impressed from such a cause. I have, related it in simple words to Jasper, and his infant imagination seems greatly excited by the relation. When he wants me to repeat it he touches his cheek and brow with my fingers. The crimson spots appear to have principally impressed him-and the story I have told him of my dead little one, whose face was marked thus on earth, that I might know it again in heaven, seems to strike some chord of feeling. Tears roll down his face as I relate the solemn vision. October, --., Since Paul's return I have sorely neglected my journal. I find that the last entry-was made nearly three weeks ago; a little after the period of A nnie Blair's death. Poor Clavering is still perfectly crushed, and yet no blame can possibly attach to him. He was rescued while insensible, by the boatman, who could not save both; and from his personal attachment to Ernest, preferred \ * ; '        l   THE HOUSEHOID OF BOU.

He has not been willing to receive even him until now, and has lain 'in darkness like one despairing. Mrs. Blair's condition is little less pitiable, and far more hopless. Annie was her only daughter. She can never recover from her loss ;-but Clavering is young, and at twenty-one a man readily throws off trouble. Quintil brought me a letter, or rather a package of letters, from Mr. IBouverie, with whom he met in Paris. Nothing could be more brilliant or amusing than his account of his stay in the French capital; .but what, interested me most of all, was the mystery contained in these few lines: "I have a revelation to make to you which will, I think, atone for all past offences (if such indeed exist) on my part against you. I will defer this, however, until you recall me, by your sown gracious act. Let not my sentence of exile extend beyond the spring." I understand very plainly what this means. Mr. Bouverie intends to return in the spring, whether I wish-it or not; but has tact enough to make it appear that his return is dependent on my will. He little knows how deeply he has struck at the root of our happiness if he supposes that any act of mine can ever sum-  ' mon him to my side again. As to his revelation, the more I con- sider it the more I am convinced that it involves some pecuniary  1 advancement, and fortune is a matter about which he is deeply  solicitous. He ought to know me better by this time than to suppose that an addition of this kind could make the slightest  difference in my estimation of, or inclination toward him. :     Nor am I one of those birds who sing better for being blinded I Oh, God! how terrible that mer ory is!  -            I *..- ,   384     TrHE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. There came a blind man, and sat on our steps yesterday, guided by a little dog. He asked for, bread and milk. I insisted on feeding him myself, and while I did so, tears rolled over my cheeks. A year ago there would have been no such vivid sympathy between us ; but now that I know from experience whit everlasting night - must be, my pity amounts almost to agony I He was an old man, with a snow-white head, and had been blind for twenty years. Philosophers talk of the equality of the humanlot. What flummery! Quintil is the quaintest fellow in the world. He was so charmed with the Savoyards in the streets of Paris, that he bought Jasper a hurdy-gurdy and a marmot; and for fear the latter would lose his accomplishment, learned to grind the little instru- ment himself, and gravely gave a daily performance of street min- strelsy, and marmot activity on the cabin table of the ship, as he came over in the "Formiosa." "How people must have laughed at you, Quintil,". I said. "To be sure they did. That was what I wished them to do. Would you have had them frown or weep on such occasions?" "No ; but it was too absurd 1 You, a man of gravity, beyond your years even ; a scientific man, too! What a caprice!"

Paul has brought me a box of superb laces, selected by a lady to whom Dr. Luther is attentive in Paris, and very expensive, I have no doubt. I will lay them aside for his wife, if such a being exists, or for Jasper's, if, indeed, his muteness shut him not out from such sweet companionship forever. I can never wear them, certainly ; when a woman feels as I do, a simple black dress, with the plainest accessories of the toilet, suits her best. What is better, he has brought' me some fine French works to read,' and the "Tales of the Crusaders," the -last novel by the author of Waverley, now well understood to be Walter Scott the poet.      , A fine edition of Byron's. poems, published since- his death, crowns the climax of his thoughtful generosity.

Decemnber.[ The last mail brought me a letter from Mr. Bouverie, dated St. Petersburg. He is domesticated at the palace. It is evi-  dent he stands high in favor with the Czar, who has conferred on  him the appointment of chief engineer of his great diamond mine' in the Ural Mountains. Nor is this only because of Mr. Bouve- rie's proficiency in the science of engineering it seems, for which his quick eye, and indomitable boldness, as well as the accuracy of his perceptions, seem to have fitted him by nature. There is another bond of interest between them in connection with these mines. The emperor's avarice is dazzled by the wonderful knowledge of gems that Mr. Bouverie displays, and by some chemical experiments he has performed before himm, in which he has succeeded, or appeared to succeed, in merging many smaller diamonds into one immense stone.  It was in consequence of his satisfaction with these experiments that the emperor presented Mr. Bouverie with the finest mag- netic diamond in the world, which he calls, from the peculiarity of its cutting, the " gnome eve," and even placed it on his finger with  his own royal hand. Figurez vous, as the French say," writes Mr. Bouverie, { a ring large enough for General Washington himself, hanging like a manacle from one of my slender fingers I I shall. never havte it altered, however, or trust it long enough from my presence for such a purpose. I manage, by fixing it over a wad of cotton, to wear it on state occasions, and as gloves are not 'de rigueur' in St. Petersburg, make quite a display whenever I raise my hand. 5I find myself at home, at this half savage court--blarbtric in spite of its splendor and seeming refinement.

This faithful retainer has always been fond of me from boyhood, and having a taste for diplomacy, is greatly impressed by the distinguished attentions so lavishy pressed upon my ac- ceptancy. He was a soldier in his youth, and retains all his  fondness for military pomp, and all-the stiffness of military train-  ing. He reveres my gnomee ring, as a signet of state, and watches over all of my personal effects with the vigilance of a dragon. This is very necessary here, I assure you, for the Spar-  tan virtue abounds in St. Petersburg, and concealment sancti- fies theft, even among gentlemen, as the half civilized Boyars  have the presumption to call themselves.

Paul and  Jasper and I sat down alone to our turkey and pudding. Later, the drawing-room door was opened, to show the beautiful Christ., mas-tree that Quintil had arrayed for Jasper, with toys, and tiny wax candles. This is something quite new to us, imitated from that he saw in Germany. The servants came in to gaze, and with them the little idiot, so frightful stilt with his bowed E shoulders, red shaggy hair, and wild, watery blue eyes. But, true to the fellowship all little children feel for each other, Jasper led him around to admire the tree, which did indeed seem to   awake a sort of delight in his imperfect nature, that Dame McCormick says she never observed in him before, from any cause. My beautiful boy, with his angelic face, and clustering curls, and  little belted tunic of black velvet, dressed like an earl's son, made a strange contrast to the poor misshapen creature, whose claw- like hand he held in his, and afterward filled with bon-bons from the tree, quite unbidden.  Paul goes to-morrow to Baltimore, where he has decided to fix himself as physician-I cannot help- thinking, with some regard to its adjacent position to Bouverie. He has not said this, however. The winter is closing in with unusual rigor. I decline all com- pany, and yet feel anything but self-sufficient. The remainder of  the season lies before me like a barren waste -evetas the snow- covered landscape now lies before my eyes-outspread to the horizon on one side, and bounded on the other by the spectral, moaning forest. How shall I'pass this dreary time away?

I was made for social intercourse, for family affection ; I was  not intended for solitude and reflection. These things, which-    ; some great minds enjoy, resolve-themselves into desolation in my a case. The wild March winds are sobbing around the house while  I write ; but I have hope now, for spring is awake again I  Yet, what can spring bring to me, beyond her tender green- her flowers-her balmy airs? Will she bring my happiness-will he bringl my husband?  Yes, the cold effigies of these, perhaps-but the reality is with the past; I cannot deny to myself, strive as I will, that I am very miserable. Perhaps it would be better for me to meekly bow down to the necessities of my case, and contend no longer. To receive Erastus with outstretched arms, and throw myself      wholly on his generosity. To suffer him to blind me-to crush me if he will-rather than live any longer this-cold, hollow, love- less life. I have overrated my own strength, my own inflexibility. I  must see him once again, before I die.                 My anxiety about him is becoming insupportable.       , y,   -   *w4i v-j J3UDUVJLKl tiJ Letters from Mr Bonuverie arrived to-day, after an interval of  three months. It is true, I have replied to neither of those he ias  already written me. I shall not reply to these; yet he will comeii. He wrote in the beginning of March--he was then on the eve of setting out for the mines ; after visiting these, he will journey  to Odessa, where he has business with Mr. Sprague, the consul,  an old friend-and then take ship for the United States, to  return again in autumn to St. Petersburg with his family, and  stablish himself there for some years.              Dr. Quintilian will accompany him, probably, on his homeward  voyage, or join him at Bouverie, in August, when Jasper will be  relinquished to his hands. He hopes these arrangements will  prove satisfactory. Thus does my husband lay down the law to me.         I The hand of steel is there in the velvet glove, yet its power is  ] irresistible.   One of these letters, for there are several in the same package,  overflows with the most exquisite tenderness for me.       Am I so weak that these expressions have power to thrill me  still ; or, is memory a cheat and a counterfeit? Why did he not !  Permit me to love him in my own way? Why did he exact the    !  high poetic sentiment that had no place in my nature, as the      proof of my deep affection? Was any one ever more true,       c more tender than I have been to him-moire submissive? What   was the use of all that jealous cruelty and suspicion of shadows,    that warped him from the right, and broke my heart?  Yet he complains, that I have always feared him-have shrunk  from him unconsciously for yearls! How could it be otherwise?        THJ HUOUfiEHOlD Or BOUVERIE.      Ui1L This much I know, I shall never fear him again. I am callous now, not courageous, yet crushed, humiliated by my sorrow and desolation, to absolute serfdom.

The lholy martyrs sang their hymns of praise, amid curling flames, and died rejoicing mid their agony. Let me keep before my eyes- such sacred examples. When I glance over all I have written since last spring, I can but smile at much of it. How surely--how entirely the snares of our fate close around us:in spite of our fiercest endeavors I I have been tamed by this solitude, and the reticence of my own nature, that forbids me to impart to any one my suffering.

Curiously enough, over the elaborate black tracery of the pattern, small golden sheaves of wheat are exquisitely embroidered, as if strewn lightly' over the surface of the lace by some careless, prodigal hand. The effect is magical. I do not know whether to accept or refuse this present. Were I to follow the dictates of 'my feelings I should certainly do the   392      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. last. Yet, perhaps this would be indelicate under the ircium. stances of Jasper's long abode with me. I cannot bear the idea, however, of receiving any acknowledgment save the gracious one of friendship, for anyvcares I may have rendered to him. It was for my own gratification, more even than his own benefit,  I craved the infant; and how fatal this adoption has been to his welfare, is evident to all the world. Dr. Quintilian can never know the truth with regard to his misfortune, and under false impressions how can I bear to accept his gift of gratitude? I will lay the dress aside and determine later about it Luther makes no mention of having heard from, or of Mr. Bouverie. I  am disappointed at this (probable) oversight on his part. The summer wears away in vain expectation, conjecture and despondency. We have no advices from Mr. Bouverie later than March. He may, however, have concluded, owing to my silence, not to write again, and may come suddenly upon us at any time. i This is a pleasant and prosperous season for the voyager. I offer daily prayers for his safety, wherever he may be. I thought Bishop Clare looked grave when he was here last week.' His duties press upon him heavily, I know. Dame McCormick seems to have grown younger since her sickness. She is twice as efficient as she was before. Smith has made a great deal of money from his strawherry and asparagus beds, now just beginning to yield abundantly. He brought me quite a pile of Spanish dollars last quarter-day, as the result of his spring sales, besides paying himself hand- somely. Paul caught a glimpse of Gabriel not'long ago, very much &ressed in the streets of Philadelphia.' He gave Quintil the " *   s -          '  .*   THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.3                cut diiect when accosted by him, with a cool "I don't know you, . sah i"   I can imagine the scene ; it was exquisite I Paul was so con-  founded, he let him pass, but in another moment was dashing after him full speed. He is confident he saw him disappear down a    : cellar door, vanishing like a rat into his hole ; his sharp coat-tail flitting last out of sight. I am very glad the pursuit ended-just so I ,August. Ships come and go, still no news from Mr. Bouverie. The conviction lies cold at my heart that I shall' never see him again. That vision was not given for nothing ; I feared so then, I feel it now. Paul lingers at Bouverie, though his destination in this month was the northern lakes. He is restless though. He sees and shares my anxiety. I cannot trust myself to agitate the sub- ject at all of my husband's safety. The other day, on' entering the breakfast-room, I saw Paul reading a letter marked with a foreign post stamp. He has his own correspondents abroad, of course. I did not question him; 'but there was something suspicious in the way he crumpled up the letter and thrust it into his pocket, out of my sight, and in his gloomy silence .afterward, and strange pallor.

Oh, Bouverie! return and I will forgive you all I I can write no more.    otf:      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. [A letter from Mr. Sprague is laid loosely in the volume, at thi, place, the narrative of which'is not resumed for the space of one year. It is dated Odessa, September, and refers to a former one written in July, to Dr. Quintilian, when rumor was afloat. It is addressed to " Madam Bouverie, Washingoton.,' It conveyed the fearful intelligence that Mr. Bouverie had been waylaid and assassinated on his way to Odessa, where he hIad intended taking ship for the United States, having written to Mr. Sprague to that effect, and forwarded part of his effects, for transportation.      ' Some difficulty had occurred, it was known to this gentleman, between Mr. Bouverie and the Czar, in connection with the open. ing of a new mine in the Ural Mountains, which had determined the former to relinquish his contract with the emperor, and return permanently to America. An imperial ukase had gone out, offering a reward for his mur- : derer; but those who knew Nicholas best, understood this politic movement, and considered Mr. Bouverie a victim. His body was never found. It need not be said that, in spite of all that had' occurred to alienate her feelings, Camilla Bouverie was overwhelmed by this intelligence. Other revelations, scarcely less crushing --and astound- ing to her feelings, followed Tast on this announcement of her hus- ?   band's fate. Mr. Bouverie's will had not been found. It was produced later.   He   had  the right to leave his estate as he pleased ;  the entail ended with him    ; but as he died intestate, it was thrown into chancery for the benefit of his heirs.  The property did not long remain unclaimed.  Edward de Courcy demanded it for his child, whose inother, the daughter of Mr. Bouverie, had died soon   after its birth, and the estate was decreed to him in trust for ~'        ,t Lilian. Then first did Camilla Bounerie know that her child had lived to woman's estate, and known the holy names of wife and mother, that the ward of Madame Ambrose, and her daughter, had been the same I After this intelligence reached her, Bishop Clare compelled Dame McCormick to testify to her part in the transac- tion, before a magistrate, so as to convince Mr. de Courcy of the justice of the claims advanced by Mrs. Bouverie, as well as to satisfy the mind of the mistress on this point. She stated thati at the time of her disappearance from Bouverie she had conveyed the infant daughter of her employer to the care of Madame Ambrose. This fact was known to the woman, still living in Scotland, who had nursed the infant, maternally, from the time they left Baltimore, until it grew past the age of early childhood, under the impression, as was Madame Ambrose, that it was motherless, or abandoned by its mother, they knew not which. Mr. Bouverie's manner in later years seems, however, to have given rise to the latter impression, and to have estab- lished a deep and abiding prejudice in the minds of his relatives against the mother of Morna Bouverie, when it was known at last that such a person still existed. Something of this has already been alluded to, and- accounts for Col. de Courcyes conduct. Whether in inviting his wife to accompany him to witness the nuptials of his child, he intended to avow everything and exone- rate her from all blame, or whether he trusted to melodramatic effect, to satisfy scruples and close bleeding wounds, cannot be known with any certainty now. The revelation he alluded to in his letter, as the charity that was to cover his multitude of sins, was certainly that of Morna's existence.  8396     THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOU VEIE. Dame McCormick declared that it was because the young mother shrieked and swooned' at the sight of the bloody spots, that he decided on removing the child. "They will risQ up against me like an' ever-present judgment," she heard him say. Bianca knew that he walked his study floor the whole night before he sent. the baby away, and always suspected that they buried an empty coffin. But they had the sagacity to send her to Croften, on an errand, that pair of accomplices on this black occasion, and when she, came back Mr. Bouverie told her the child was dead, and ready for sepulture. The coffin was already closed up. Mrs. Bouverie was lying in deep lethargy, and Dame McCormick had disappeared. Bianca had always feared that the baby had been murdered by Dame McCormick, yet not one word of this, nor of the reality of the bloody glove, had ever transpired until now. Such was the awe with which Mr. Bouverie inspired his dependents, even those who hated him. In proportion as these horrors pressed upon her attention, the poignant sorrow of Mrs. Bouverie, for her husband's fate, naturally abated. Fresh fuel came to feed the old fire of wrong and injury, and when she found herself repelled by Edward de Courhy haughtily, contemptuously, almost from all e Ni upon his child, something like indignation asserted itself again, against her husband's me- mory.  She had besought her son-in-law to bring the infant to see her; he, refused to do so in terms that left her no longer in doubt as to the opinion he had received of her acts and character. She did not remonstrate, nor attempt the slightest vindication of her life. She did not claim, as her friends told her she could do, a portion bf her husband's estate from her grandchild. Later, when the will came to light, she exacted all in accordance with o    THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE.        397 its provisions, and again suffered her motives to be misconstrued rather than explain a truth that must have been fatal to- the con-  cealed master of Bouverie. ."                    i Had it not been for his secret presence in her house, she would  . not have turned on her heel for the income of his English funded property j 'We have seen how this was applied, and to what uses.- As it was, the cry deepened against her in Scotland, and Lilian's relatives determined that the child should never know even of-  her existence. It has been shown how this resolution was car-  ried out, and how wonderfully, at the last, Providence shaped the rough hewn ends of man's intention.                  B In the meantime, how had it really fared with Bouverie? Seized and shut up with his attendant and crucibles, and materials for work, in a Russian prison, he was conumanded to exert his art forthe bene- fit of the Czar, and offered his freedom as the price of his success.  Three times the despot, visited him in that lonely fortress on the . Caspian Sea, and three times left him disappointed and exaspe- rated, yet believing more and more firmly each time, in the power    of his prisoner to execute his will a Toward the end of the fourth year of his imprisonment,       a Erastus Bouverie was unexpectedly released. The officer who     a came to announce to him his freedom, 'required simply that hee  should sign the paper he laid before him, as the price of his liberty. It contained an acknowledgment merely on the part of the prisoner, that the immurement had been voluntary, to which-   ? he had been subjected, and submitted to for scientific purposes alone. A purse of gold was laid beside the document. This was  no time for hesitation, Erastus Bouverie 'signed the paper and ' took the gold, though cursing the necessity that made him do .   : Other, in his heart. In three hours more he was journeying in a D i   398      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVCrE. close vehicle with Fabius, followed by a wagon containing his effects, on the road to Odessa. The long, rude journey was accomplished at last, and what was Mr. Sprague's astonishment to see standing before him the wreck of the man he had believed to have been murdered four years before I Few explanations were given: Mr. Bouverie's great anxiety to reach his home, was met by exertions on the part of his friend, to obtain for him as speedy and direct a passage as possible to an American port. He sailed in September, and reached New York in little more than a month afterward. He there heard the news of his wife's approaching marriage to Dr. Quintilian. This was proved on the trial by the gentleman who had communicated the fact to him, in answer to his apparently careless inquiry, unconscious of his identity-add he remained a perdu " a month longer, waiting for the very day to arrive, fixed for the wedding. The knowledge of this circumstance destroyed all hope -of mercy from the jury-all sympathy for his condition iXS public mind, and he was condemned to die by Judge Wardlaw, in the December of the same year. The circumstances of the caseas- related by the papers of the day were simply these : "Camilla Bouverie and Luther Quintilian were united, at the residence of the former, by the Right Reverend Bishop Clare, on the twentieth of November, 18-, in the presence of a few friends. "After partaking of a collation, the guests separated at the hour of seven in the evening, taking advantage of an early moonlight to reach their respective homes before it became dark. Bishop Clare alone remained at Bouverie.

They returned to find Dr. Luther Quintilian a corpse, weltering in blood, in the arlls of his bride, and to behold Erastus Bouverie standing grimly  over him. He had entered the drawing-room as the sound of the departing carriages reached his ear, from his place of conceal-  ment, and discharged- his pistol with unerring fidelity through the heart of Dr. Quintilian'. "Bishop Clare was standing on the portico when this occurred, and came, lile the rest, too late to interpose. Dr. Paul Quin-  tilian had left 3Bouverie with the cavalcade of horsemen that escorted the carriages, intending to return before midnight. His absence at the moment was most unfortunate. Mr. Bouverie has, of course, been placed under strict arrest. "Able counsel has been retained for him.- ,         -  We have seen how he died, or seemed to die, by his own hand       a few days before that fixed for his execution  how, for the  sake of the love they bore him inhe past-men of hitherto  unspotted honor, Dr. Moore and Bishop Clare, lent themselves   .  zealously to the stratagem.

It was in vain that his friends conjured Erastus Bouverie to  return to Europe-and that his injured wife refused for a long  time to lend him her countenance.    400      THE HOUSEHOLD OF BOUVERIE. He persisted in renmaining where he was, and yielding to his determination, yet unwilling to trust to his discretion, so often baffled by his temerity, conditions were sternly affixed tco his stay under his own roof, by Dr. Paul Quintilian and his wife--of which we have witnessed both the success and' the failure. / The great, stairway was removed-the upper floor sealed away from the lower-and limits assigned to his freedom, almost as stringent as those of a prison. Then, too, commenced that quiet work of ministry and self-sacrifice, and practical Christianity that"  shadowed while it ennobled the whole " household of Bouverie."  A few more extracts from the diary of Camilla Bouverie and the story closes. The end of the third year of her widowhood has now arrived. Dr. Quintilian had returned to reside in the T3nited States a twelvemonth before.] Se, ptember.,  I can no longer disguise from myself what Dr. Quintilian's attentions mean, nor the interest hp has awakened in my. heart. I thought for a long time he was engagedtto that Parisian Jady, and was-so absorbed with my own wretchedness that I accepted his ministry as # mere matter of course, due to my affliction.  The words he spoke to-day, of which, however, I took no seem- ing notice, were unmistakable. He means to address me, and I shall marry him. In the silent communion of the night, and my ' own heart, I utter these words firmly and fearlessly. On your bosom, my faithful friend, my only confidant; dear insensible diary, I inscribe my intention. Keep it sacredly, as you have done all the rest that I have given to your keeping, until the time comes when the fire shall consumeeyour pages, for under this new order of things I shall not transmit you beyond the grave. * ,   /      ,   THE HOUSEHOLD OF ]BOU VElE.       401 Yes, Luther; noble, true and well-beloved, I will take thy  guiding hand and walk with thee' through life, and with Paul and Jasper, both of thy honored blood, and dear to me as blood of my own could make them, we will form a happy and united house- hold at last. No more dark jealousy and mystery, no haunting dread of nameless horror and secret crime shall begird my ex- istence, and lie like a brooding shadow over my hearth. Luther Quintilian is a man for daylight and practical affection, and truth and virtue are sealed on his superb and manly brow. I will put the past behind me like an ill dream, and though thie  freshness of my life is gone away forever, with youth and its  accompaniments, I shall not despair of making much of the rem- nant yet.

When we neared the stile, I saw that a colored man was sitting on' the lowest step, very ragged, apparently old, with a torn hat, whose limp and battered brim drooped around his face, so as to conceal the upper portion entirely from view. The beggar-- for such I suppoaed him to be-did not change his position until I stood quite close beside him, when suddenly raising his thin hand he drew off his hat-literally as one would remove a glove-and disclosed the changed, but still recognizable face of Gabriel. I uttered an exclamation\of surprise, he was so woefully altered; his hair, in which he took such unaccountable pride, and which he: had trimmed always in a sort of jay-bird crest, clung thin and knotty now, quite flat to his head; and his once sable 'skin, so sleek and shining, was chnged to a dingy copper-color. His clothing, too, was wretchedly worn and old; he that had been idolatrously fond of his attire I It was the most lamentable meta- morphosis I ever beheld. "Don't you know me, Miss Camilla?" he said, at last, in tremu-  lous tones. "Certainly," I said, "Gabriel," clasping the poor hand, which he half extended, then drew back in a deprecating way. "Poor fellow! you must have been ill?" "Sick all summer, Miss Camilla, down in a dark cellar in dat dreadful big city, whar ebery black man has to fight for his-self. Sick and neglected ; no vittals, no physic, no light, no air, no one to care for me; no doctor to come and go. Oh, my mistress, my, heart done broke long ago; I has just crawled home to die."

The poor wretch burst into a convulsive flood of tears.      - thought it best to leave him ; but turning, saw Jasper leading him tenderly to the kitchen.

Mrch, To-day I promised Dr. Quintilian, if he would wait until autumn, to marry him then. He thinks the delay unreasonable, I can see ; but is too gentlemanly to say so. I can assign no rear - son for delaying our marriage until that season, that would satisfy him ; but the truth is, I want to pass through a severer ordeal of self-examination, and devotion to my religious duties, than my depressed and anxious condition has permitted me to undertake in the last three years.  No one but a Catholic could understand this feeling, exactly, and as I have determined that our religious opinions shall never clash, I will not propose this necessity as a theme for argument between us now.

Gabriel dreamed that his master stood before him, and said in stern accents: "Gabriel-why did you let Sahib die in my absence? Did you { forget to wash out his mouth with blood as I bade you?' He then awoke-this was -the whole vision-but he was covered with cold sweat from its effects-it was so real, he says, that he believes his master is not dead and that he will  return.                              I am annoyed at the creature's willful perversity on this occa- a sion-and at the ghastly glimpse he gives of the means by which it is barely possible Sahib was made so fierce and -unmanageable.  But this may be merely imaginary.  Paul seems gloomy and discontented-I know not why this  should be. I begin to suspect some secret attachment, and have  communicated my suspicions to Luther,  He laughs at the idea,  and declares that Paul, like his prototype, is indifferent to the sex ; but he cannot enter fully into the confidence of his reserved  and greatly younger brother. I wish Paul would confide in me. He is sure of my sympathy, at least; or, if he will not do this, I wish he would try and throw off his gloom, just now, if only for my salke.

Yet Jasper, strangely enough, evinces a decided preference for  Paul, over his own father. There seems to be indeed a love  "passing -the love of woman,7 between these two-deep, and almost impassioned. This is the more singular, as Jaspef has an, instinctive love for the beautiful, which would naturally attract him to his extremely handsome father.  I am unwise, perhaps, to suffer my feelings to carry me. away, as they are doing, more and more powerfully each day.

"If not fit to rear my own child, certainly not fit to take charge of his.' Those were Mr. de Courcy's sentiments, expressed in haughty disdainful words, that have never ceased to rankle in my heart. My daughter's existence and death are but dreams to me-far less distinct than the vision that brought her so clearly before me on her marriage night, an instance of clairvoyance, I doubt not now. Yet, the disappointment of her fate, and the repulse I received with regard to her infant, came very near destroying me -connected as these were, with the consciousness of cruel treat- ment from the hands of him I had so, sincerely lamented. The whole thing was crushing, and but for the ministry of Paul and Luther, I think I must have died. What patience-what forbearance-what devotion they mani- fested toward me-and how grateful I ought to be to both I Surely, whatever care I had bestowed on Paul and Jasper, was returned fourfold, by such tender, unremitting attentions. All this time I never suspected Luther's sentiments for me, yet he says they existed from the first moment of his return, perhaps long before, unconsciously. It was months before I could respond to them sufficiently to give him room to speak them to my ear, and even -after we were partially engaged, I felt that I was scarcely doing him justice, by  matching such a broken spirit as mine with his fresh and buoy- ant nature. This objection is fully removed now. I feel that I have risen to his level again-he has rescued me as a strong swimmer reaches out his hand to sustain a feeble one-and I can staad before the altar with him when the time arrives, with every con.

A question for Bishop Clare I Jwie. Poor Gabriel is dead.    On this lovely June   morning he  breathed his last, supported by Paul, who had been sitting up with him all night, and bending his last grateful looks upon my face.  It is evening now, and all the negroes in the neighborhood have  poured in to witness his burial.  I hear the high-pitched mono- tonous voice of the negrd-preacher from where I sit, pouring forth  his exhortations over the dead.  The prayers and groanings have  not yet begun.                   He was arrayed in death as it would have rejoiced his heart to  have been once more in life.  Paul gave a half-worn suit of black  broadcloth for his burial garb.

Bishop Clare begs me to bear with her presence if possible ; but I cannot help very unchristian feelings toward her at times.  "       m I shall try, however, to control these, and to be kind to her declining age for the sake of him that is gone. Paul thinks that Gabriel's frame and constitution would have sustained him to, extreme old age, had he not committed his  ridiculous escapade. He had some money in the beginning, which he squandered in dissipation ; ran riot in every way, fell outi of employment, became ill, and missing the attention that had always been bestowed on him, hopelessly despondent.
