The  stories preceding "Hidden  Treasure; or, The Good St. Nicholas," form a sort of genealogical History, and appear to have been told at a certain ( Christmas Party.  Being earlier in order of time, they have been placed before the more recent per- sonal .adventures A of the hero of the concluding story, who is one of those that " have seen the world and been sworn at Highgate," and if we may take his word for it, is, himself a descendant of "the great" and "the good"St. Nicholas.         .   o THE LADY OF LAWFORD: A LEGEND OF THE OLDEN TIME. d Tis a hlstory Hanie from ages down ; a nurse's tale." )   CHAPTER I.. , fairer than the d Or the flowery meads-in May; If she' be not so to me, THE LADY OF LAWFORD. CHAPTER I. ' Be she' fairer than the dy, Or the flowery meads in May; , If she be not so to me, .  What care-I how fair she be? i, ,  'WITHER. IN the latter part of the fourteenth cen tury, there dwelt in a castellated manor- Iouse"at Lawford, on the banks of the gently-flowing Avon, an interesting youngo widow, mistress of her own fair self and of an estate scarcely less fair. Her husband had died at Poictiers, gloriously fighting for his king.  She was an heiress, having inherited the manor of Lawford 'from  her-father, who,    1,2   THE LADY OF LAWFORD. with her brothers, had also been slain in the bloody wars of that disturbed period. The". Lady Isabel-thus " to the manor born "-be- ing without children, became, as might/have been expected, an object of interest and so- licitude, especially to those young gallants who hovered about the provincial court held at the Castle of Warwick. ! ; Many a lance, in that chivalric age, had; been broken in her honor, and dull would have been thought the banquet not graced by her presence. But in vain were lances broken, and in vain Were chansons sung, by troubadours coming from afar. She looked'and she listened, but,'like 'the virgin queen 'of a later age, no choice would she nmake; no sign, such as an adventurous cavalier might hope to build a fortune upon, did she give. Whether it was that the fair widow cher- ished too fondly the memory of her late la- mented lord, or whether-like the afore- said queen-she loved too well the sweets ,  . ,         , / '   i THE LADY OF' LAWFORD.     13 of undivided authority over her feudal do- main, was by no means clear. The persistent coyness of this dainty dame-which some called coquetry in dis- guise--drew notes of admiration even from a Chaucer, who' thus alludes to her in the "Canterbury Tales :,/"?    ,      , c' Ful fetise*' was hire cloke, as I was ware; Of smale corall aboute hire arm she bare A pairt of bedes, gauded all with grene ; And thereon heng a broche of gold ful shene, On whiche was first ywriten a crouned A, And after, ' Amor vincit omnia.' " But whatever may have been the hopes excited in the ardent bosoms of beholders by. this flattering jewel, they were doomed to disappointment, for the love 'which con- quers all had not yet conquered our Lady Isabel; for Lady of Lawford she was, and Lady of Lawford she seemed determined to remain. But, alas! she soon found that a *Neat.        t A set of strings.   I14   THE LADY OF LAWFORD. woman could not well stand unsupported in the world about her. It was a gallant age, that reign of King ' *  '  t. /i          ' Edward III., yet, in spite of the' pictur- esque d escriptions left us by Froissart, one can sometimes perceive, under the. grace- ful forms of chivalry, the'; same hard-heart- eUt cruelty and selfilhness common 'to fallen human nature in evqry age. As time rolled' on, and the Lady of Law, , ,ford made no choice, her admirers gradu- ally slackened in their attentions. At first, disinterested neiglihbors in search of wives, 'for themselves 'or for their sons, grew coldly polite; then, by 'degrees, they be- came  aggressive, "disputing  her feudal rights, plundering her tenants, destroying /, her game, and wasting her forests., 'Had' she possessed a ,more heroic spirit, , , she might, like the Countess, de Montfort, -have donned her late husband's armor, and, at the head of her vassals and re- tainers, held her own; but, as it' was,       THE LADY OF LAWFORD.   -  15 she could, only trust to' the generosity and magnanimity of those around her. As for an appeal to the higher powers, what "could a woman do, in courts where the steel gauntlet of a warrior far outweighed the' silken glove of a lady, let her or, her cause be ever so fair?  One day, says 'the Lawford chronicler, she was returning from avisit -to War- ' wick Castle, where, with other high-born dames and' demoiselles, she had been as- sisting at one of the stately pageants for which Warwick was, at that time, as fam- ous, as its rival, Kenilworth, came to be at a later day, when she was met by a miller, -all woe-begone," with a complaint of wrong and robbery suffered at the hands of the armed' retainers of a marauding baron of the neighborhood.     , This truculent baron, whose followers had thus plundered and beaten the miller, was an unsuccessful suitor of the Lady Isabel; and, on 1 being rejected, had set   I6   THE LADY OF LA JFORD. up a claim toher land, which he main- tained rightfully belonged to him, as heir- male of a common ancestor. As shed heard the poor man's tale of woe, the necessity of a champion to-assert her rights and those of her tenantry, forc- ,ibly presented---itself to her mind. On occasions of doubt and difficulty the Lady' Isabel's r-esource for counsel and ad- vice had always been her relative, William de Lawford, the Abbot of Pipewell. There was a grange belonging to the abbey, conveniently located on the oppo- site bank of the Avon, over against the , manor-house of Lawford.  Here, fortu- nately, the good Abbot was found. "Daughter," said he, "my advice may be summed up in a word," and strange -to say, considering his calling, that word, em- ; phatically pronounced, was,--"Marry." 'tWhat!" said she, blushing with mod- esti or indignation.; " give myself a mas- ter "  '   "THE LADY OF LAWFORD.   17 71  "Nay, my daughter; but rather thyself and thy dependents a protector," replied the Abbot.    - L"And why not retire from the world, and take the veil?" quoth she, "resign- . ing my land' to the next of kin, who would doubtless be willing to enrich the nunnery beyond any charge there might be on my account."   ' "Nay, nay, my' daughter," again replied the good Abbot; "you should 'not thus shrink from the duty Providence'has laid upon -you. As for the endowment of our so-called houses of religion, they have al- ready more than enough of this world's goods; and  I fear me, if they do not' speedily mend their ways, the riches they trust in will be taken from them, and, iwith their corruptions, their very name will be swept away by the already impending besom  of destruction." The mind of the good Abbot, in this matter, appears to have been somewhat in i            i ,.  '  '  '         ' ' I   18   THE LADY OF LAWFORD, advance of the 'age. Possibly his opinions had been influenced by the preaching of Wycliffe, whose sermons and writings had already begun to stir the hearts of thought- ful men. , But I care naught," said she, ( for such gay gallants as have sought my hand in marriage; men whose lives are spent at   court, fiddling and fighting,; drinking and dicing, and who, a-lack-a-7y, I fear," said she, "love the land better than the lady."' A devoutly-disposed maiden aunt, her constant companion, here observed that, perhaps, if her niece were to commend herself to the prayers of the .good St. r Nicholas, he might take pity on her-un- protected state, and send one whose stal- wart arm might be unto her like a wall of defence against all oppressors.; Now, there- happened to be at Pipewell, a chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas,* and, * By reference to Dugdale's "Monasticon," the ed- i ,        i ^  *  .  , ' ' ^   ' '!

I9 thus prompted, the abbot, who, although enlightened beyond his time, was still -a monk, caught at the suggestion, and forth- with recommended   a pilgrimage  thither. Moreover, as the Festival of St. Nicholas was now approaching, the season    seemed propitious; "and peradventure," said the abbot, "tlhe Child-bishop, who is the repre- sentative of the good St: Nicholas, may in his sernion enlighten your mind as to the itor finds that there was really a Cistercian Monastery at Pipewell, in Northamptonshire, with a grange of that house in the immediate neighborhood of Lawford Hall. Unfortunately, the 'ruins of the- abbey have disap- peared, so that it is now nearly impossible to identify the localities mentioned in the'story, with' anything like precision,' except that it stood on both. sides of, Harper's Brook, which divided the Hundreds of, Roth- well and Corby; hence the ancient name of St. Mary de Divisis. In the inventory of the Abbey, however, taken at the dissolution, in the time of Henry VIII., particular mention is nmade of the Chapel of St. Nicholas, ind of a table whereon was painted the image of that benevo- lent patron of husbandless dames and maidens all forlorn.          .! * . * i, -,    i r   20  .

Gracefully yielding to persuasive argu- ments, the Lady of Lawford hastily prepared to make the pilgrimage recommended; so that sunrise, next morning, saw our heroine's departure for 'Pipewell Abbey, with at- tendance befitting her rank and station.

In the midst of the cav- alcade were the ladies, mounted on pillions behind, their pages; saucy youths these, whose discourse was .of the mighty things they would do with their gilded daggers, should they be so fortunate as to meet with a perilous adventure. But Brewthebestthe steward, ordered  them   to bridle their tongues, remarking that braggadocia thus t ' , . . ' ' ,  . 1f ?   22    THE-LADY OF LAWFORD. early in the day boded no good.   The man- ners of the t'me permitted no reply; never- theless, the most  forward  of them   mur- mured, loud enough for his mistress to hear: "Folks say,iMaster Brewthebest, that thou lovest better the clatter of flagons than the turmoil of the fight." - It was the Feast of St. Nicholas, and the     , Monastery of Pipewell, which they were ap- '   proaching, was all astir with preparations for the celebration of the Festival.* The Boy-bishop, elected on the eve pre- , -  . * The Feast of the Boy-bishop, as it was called, was a ceremony of high antiquity and)general usage, whi'chl was celebrated with great splendor on: the, Feast of St. Nicholas, or the Holy Innocents. On this occasion it was customary in all cathedral churches (and probabl'y in most large and. opulent parishes), for some one of the children of the choir to bear the title and state of a bishop, to wear the epikcopal,robes, and to exact obe- dience froln his companions, who were -habited like priests; nay, singular as it may appear, they took pos- session of the church, and, except Mass, performed all the ceremonies and offices of religion.--Miscellanea Antigza Aglicana.    ,   THE LADY OF LAWFORD.    23 ceding (Dec. 5th), was now to assume the  j symbols of ecclesiastical 'authority, and clad in episcopal robes, to go in state from the abbot's house, surrounded by his fellow- choristers, likewise arrayed in- priestly vest- ments, although their costume was that of petty canons. In an opening glade stood the abbey, against a dark background of forest trees, its towers, gablets, and pinnacles glistening in the morning sun. Here and there, on . the lawn before the, abbey, patches of green grass might be seen breaking through the thin covering of snow, now rapidly disap,- pearing in the genial atmosp'here, as if Moth- er Earth herself were smiling upon this children's festival,; or as if summer were still lingering to welcome the return of old Father Christmas. The five bells, which hung in the central tower of the minster, were'sonorously peal- ing, and from far and near, 'people in their best array" "were assembling, as the Lady             .         .   24    THE LADY, OF LAWFORD. o    f       . *        * of Lawford and her attendants drew near the sacred pile. As they enter the arched gateway of the: monastery, the mimic bishop issues forth from the abbot's house, in all his pontifi- cal glory; and -as the procession, with its glittering crosses and gorgeous, banners, ,sweeps round the cloistered court to the door of the chuch h, the bells, which till ,then had kept, up their clamorous welcome, suddenly cease; and, as' if in response to their joyful chimes, the organ takes up the melodious strain, whilst the choir, ad- vancing under a cloud of incense, moves up the nave singing "In Excelsis Gloria;" for in those days carols were sung, not only at Christmas, but all through the season of-Advent. And thus in St. Mary's aisle children' sang: "When Christ was born of Mary free In Bethlehem, that fair city, Angels sang, with mirth and glee, In Excelsis Gloria;" !- - ,   * :t .{ }   THE LaDY OF LAWFORD.    25 even as, "in the old time before themn," children in the temple had sung "Hosanna in .the' Highest!."  But was not all this, burlesquing solemn Ch1urch services? Did not the relaxed discipline which Clutrch dignitaries ac- corded to subordinates at thisseason, lead 'to indecent and disorderly conduct? Un- fortunately, riotous and indecent .behavior' , to'o often followed the exuberant hospital- ity attenaant upon the Installation Ceremo- nies of thel Boy-bishop; but certainly, this was not the intention of the founders of the institution; and the abuse of the thing 'is no argument against its use. To look at it in t!he light of the, fourteenth century, St. Nicholas was the acknowledged patron saint- of children; and why should not children commemorate the early .piety attribut'ed to the saint, by taking an- extraordinary part' in the ritual observances of the' season, especially' as they ,approached the iFestival of the' Nativity, when even enlightened, 2      . *  ,"-        .

"The memory of, this Saint and Bishop Nicholas," says one of our divines, "was thus solemnized by a child, the better to remember the holy man, even when he was a child; and his childlike virtues, when he became a man ..,.;. . His meek-  ness and simplicity, the proper virtues of children, he maintained from his childhood as long ashe lived. A4d therefore," saith "The Festival," chiladren don him wors/hip before all other saints." To be sure, Henry VIII. issued a proc- lamation against this ceremonial of the Boy-bishop; but then, the king had quar- relled with the monks, and moreover, as a reformer, was strangely inconsistent. As a witness to the truth, one would prefer the '! testimony of his contemporary, Dean Colet, whom even zealous Protestants admit ,to have been a wiser and better man than 1 the king.'         ,    of THE LADY OF LAWFORD.    27 In the statute's of the school attached to St. Paul's Cathedral, we find the Dean' making provision for the continuance and  regular observance of' this very festival. It was ordained (15I2) that all his scholars "shall every Childermas Day come to Paulis churche and hear the Child-bishop's ser- - mon, and after be at- th'e high mass; and each of them   offer a Id. to the Child- bishop, and with them the maisters and surveyors of the Bschool." Dean   Colet, although: he lived before the  Reformation, was no Romanist; he would have been burned for a   heretic, says Latimer, ' if God had not turned the king's heart to the contrarie." But the Lady Isabel had neither scru- ple nor doubt as to the lawfulness- or ex- pediency of the Installation service, in which she' was participating. Had she not em- broidered, with her own  fair hands, the vestments- worn by the Episcopus, Puer- orum?   And 'did she not, at the offertory .2;    28   THE LADY OF LAWFORD. which followed the sermon of the Child-  bishop, contribute an amount which testi- , fied, more eloquently than words could do, X the interest she tookl in, the proceedings? - Indeed, the glittering contents of the silken 'I purse which the Lady of Lawford dropped  .: into the alms-basin, reminded one of a   . similar action of the good Saint Nicholas ! himself, who threw purses of gold into the . windows of certain penniless damsels, thus filling their stockings with that which, in ; those mercenary days, sufficed to, procure husbands for them.            , ;:  The sermon was, in accordance with es- tablished us ge, a panegyric, in which the :! life and doi/gs of the good Saint Nicho- las were hel up to the wondering admira- tion of' the congregation. Great stress was laid by the preacher on the courtesy and liberality of' the saint; his charity and  benevolence in providing for the wants of others; in particular for those impover- ished daughters of a noble house, whom ' ' ^ ^'  "           * "^^   THE LADY OF LAWFORD.    29  'his timely bounty saved from the infamous course of life to which their father, in his despair, would have condemned them. In conclusion, he exhorted' his hearers, many of whom were children, some of them his schoolfellows, to emulate the virtues of the saint; and as the Child-bishop was an Exhibitioner, or scholar selected by the monastery for university education, and as the offerings were to augment the fund for that purpose, his peroration naturally' as- sumed a rather pathetic tone; for, like the noble damsels he had mentioned, he was also in want of a living, and the univer- sity was then, as now, the high road to preferment.   cHAPTER III. i, "Now Christ thee save, thou reverend friar, ? I pray thee tell to me If ever at yon holy Shrine My true love thou didst see." PERCY, RELIQUES. IN those days of frequent pilgrimages, fair ladies flocked to holy shrines, with very much the same motive as they now do to our fashionable watering-places. Worldly. advancement or affairs of gallantry, rather than healtl--whether of body or soul- being often the real object of the votary. ; The famous Walsingham, where one might have heart's desire, by drinking at its wishing-well, was an eminent example. g   Says the old ballad:   TIE LADY OF LAWFORD.     3I "As I went to Walsingham, To the shrine witl spede, Met I with a jolly Palmer, In a pilgrim's weede, "' Now God you save, you jolly Palmer! ' ' Welcome, Lady gay! Oft have I sued to thee for love.' ' Oft have-I said you nay.' " Then, every condition of life had a pat- ron saint or heavenly advocate, bound to intercede for his or her votary; and among these, none was more popular, at least among the ladies, than our good St. Nicholas.  It -would appear as if the Saints had ta- 'ken the place' of the overthrown deities of Greece anct Rome; for' St. Nicholas seems to have been the Hymen, as well as. the Neptune, of the Middle Ages. But to the story: In a side chapel of the Abbey Church of Pipewell, there was a shrine containing a small portion of the relics of St. Nicholas- a treasure obtained at great cost to the   32   THE LADY OF LAWF ORD. community. This shrine was the resort of I many a disconsolate maiden, and of 'widows not a few.- The chapel was separated from the choir and south transept by several arches spring- ing from clustered columns. Opposite the transept door was the altar, over- wich, seated within a richly-moulded niche, was  the image of the wonder-working Saint Nicholas. Early and late, husbandless dames and languishing spinsters might be seen kneel-  ing before this lihymeneal altar. Some  . I chose the right-hand side-some the left; ' others the front; as if' the favor of the  ' saint depended upon the position of the suppliant. The very steps of the altar were worn into hollows by the number and importunity of'the numerous devotees, who, ofttinMes, knelt upon their bare knees. Here, undisturbed by the bodily pres- ence of the sterner'sex, these devout fair ones, while making their orisons, might lis-   THE LADY OF LAWFORD.    33 ten to the soothing voices of the brethren in the choir, as they chanted the canonical hours, only separated from them by the screen of carved oak.  The High Mass, which followed the In- stallation ceremony, being ended, the Lady of Lawford, with her female attendants, retired to the 'chapel we have endeavored to describe, that she might accomplish her vow.! Her prayers, according to our more en- lightened views, were misdirected, even idolatrous; but then the fault was that of the agte, whilst the actuating piety and fer- vor were all her own. No;w, whether it was Saint Nicholas, or only her own good angel, that prompted rher footsteps, the first person the Lady Isabel set eyes upon, as she left the church, .was a certain gallant cavalier, whose gilt spurs and plumed cap betokened knightly rank. To be sure, she had seen Sir William de Boughton once before, at Warwick -Castle, I     ,        -,   .     34   THE LADY OF LAWFORD. when he and other good knights were con- tending for a prize of chivalry. But now the meeting seemed significant, considering the nature of her late devotions. The recognition was mutual, and she blushed as she curtsied to his respectful' sal- utation; but conscious embarrassment gave to her manner a stiffness and reserve calcu- lated to discourage nearer approach. There was in the quadrangle' a group of mummers, -grotesquely masked, who were executing a sword-dance on the grass-plot round which the cloisters were, built. Robin Hood in Lincoln green, with his Maid Ma- rian in a kirtle of the same, and the hobby- horse and the dragon, were all there. She noticed that one of the mummers appeared to be closely watching her move- ments, and that he seemed to be in com- munication with a muffled figure standing apart in the shadow of the cloisters, as if, shunning observation. A second glance lshowed her    thit the man was a retainer , ' /       '   THE LADY OFT LAWFORD.   3j of Sir Robert, d'Allesley, the unfriendly neighbor of whom the miller "-had com- plained. This acquaintance with the mask- ers, who seemed unknown to the rest of  - the bystanders, was suspicious. She thought little of the circumstance at the time, although she had ever after good reason to recall it. However, her attention. was soon diverted by a summons to the refectory, where a banquet had been pro- vided befitting the occasion. After the dinner was over an d the tables  had been drawn, there was presented to the company one- of those mystery or miracle plays, which, originally intended for Christmas representation, was, like the carols, often performed at this season, as if in anticipation of the Festival. Indeed, among our ancestors, the whole month odf -December was called, 'on account of the Nativity occurring in it, Helzigh, or Holy Month, just as the Germans to this day con- tinue to call it Christ Monat.   36-   THE LADY OF LAWFORD. The Boy-bishop and his -fellows were now transformed into kings and prophets ; the play represcilted being that in which the heroes bf the Old Testament were person- ified.  As they entered the hall, each 'recited a verse prophetic of the birth of Christ. There was Moses arrayed in an albe and cope, with the appearance of a horned glory over .his head, a long beard and a staff, and. the tables of the law in his hand; and there was Isaiah, also in an albe, with a red stole bound round his head; ancd Jeremiah in the vestments of a -priest, bearing a scroll in his hand. But the character which, of all others, excited most admiration, was that of Ba- laam mounted upon an ass; there was, however, but little of the animal to be seen, except the head and ears, the rest of the body beinig hidden beneath a foot- cloth that sw'ept the floor. Before, him, as he rode into the hall, stood a young mran ,      TrHE LADY OF LAWFORD.    37 with a drawn sword in his hand, as if to bar further progress; whilst from the pen- etralia of the donkey there issued a lament- able voice : "CGr me Ccarz'bus miseram sic 1c0ditis?"The dialogue that folldwed was from the' twenty-second chapter of Num- bers. Indeed, the whole thing migohtt have been very edifying, had it not been for an unforeseen accident. The refectory was a spacious building in the style of a baronial hall of the period, with a lofty timber roof, such as may still be seen at the St. Cross Hospital, Winches- tero,  Now, as the procession was moving round the fire, which, in those days, occupied the centre of the hall, the smoke escaping through an opening in th]e roof, the donkey, not content with the modest part assigned to him in the pageant, thought proper to add his "most sweet voice" to the chorus or carol which, his fellow-performers were  singing.     I I3$S  THE LADY OF LAWFORD. t-        As, however, ithis asinine   contribution , formed no part of the regular programme, the vigorous he-haw! he-haw! of the jackass p I ut an end to all solemnity, and, although tle brute was summarily kicked. out, it was found  impossible to restore anything like ' decorum.   CHAPTER IV. "It is. held That valor is the chiefest virtue, and Most dignifies the haver." SHAKESPEARE. IT was toward the close of the short winter day that the Lady of Lawford and her followers set out on  their return. Whether it was the-recent hilarity, or their hurried departure, there appeared to be something of disorder in their, march, as they straggled' forth from the' courtyard of the monastery.. This carelessness of array, at any otl ers time, would have brought down upon them a sharp rebulke from  the steward. But Master Brewthebest had just taken a very affectionate leave of his good gossip, the   40   THE LADY OF LAWFORD.

The Lady of Lawford, however, uncon- scious of' danger, and trusting to the dis- cretion of ::tlhe steward, felt Ino apprehen- sion; the I escort under his command being thought; even in those unsettled times, quite- sufficient for their protection, al- though ,the road homeward lay through an extensive woodland, the undergrowth , - ' of 'which offered tempting lurking-places for those roystering blades profanely called "Clerks 'of Saint Nicholas." But i Brew- thebest was, at, that moment, on  too good terms with himself and all man- kind to suspect evil from, any quarter. His men, who had also partaken gather X freely of the good cheer provided by the hospitable monks, were inclined to loiter, , beguiling the way with merry tales and - chansons gay, such as pilgrims were wont to indulge in; and'so it felli out, as they ' forded a stream that crossqd their path,   TiEm LADY OF LAWFORD.    41 the party became separated, the ladies, with the steward and one or two others, being considerably in advance. Presently their further progress was stopped by the, prostrate trunk of a tree lyin;g across" their path; andj as they at- tempted to clear the way, they fo nd them- selves suddenly surrounded by an armed band in masks, who appeared to be' the identical sword-dancers they had seen, in the morning, in the cloisters of the abbey. Their swords, however, were no longer used in sport, but in downright earnest; for in a moment they. had disarmed the steward and his men, and had bound their hands behind .their backs. This was done with the utmost dispatch, and they  were rapidly hurried off by an unfrequented path that wound through the woods.  The Lady .Isabel recognized their lead- er as the man who had hovered about the sword-dancers, rattling a money-box    I -  42   ' THE LADY OF LAWFORD. and holding covert communication with the retainer of Sir Robert d'Allesley. The sun had now set, and the Lady had given up all for lost. Entreaties and prayers had been made in vain; for the ruffians were unmoved by either prayers or tears. The place of her destination she could not learn, for the maskers were as doggedly silent, on that as on all other subjects.- The path they were pursuing grew narrower, so that thley were obliged to move cautiously and in, single file'. As they advanced, the -ound of rushing water froma cascade they were approach- ing, afforded the ,page of the Lady I'sa- bel the opportunity for which he had been waiting. "Cheer up, my Lady,", said he, in a low voice; "help ,may be nigh 1 ' at hand; for, as we were crossing the stream, I chanced to look back, and I be- held, in the distance, the rays of the set- ; ting sun flashing back from the arms of that good knight, Sir William de Bough- \             , -  '!    ,     *.  * ,  -'  ' !

"Now the saints be praised!" said the, Lady Isabel, raising her clasped hands to heaven, as if in supplication or as wit- nesses to a vow she was mentally making.. She said nothing of it, however, to the page, behind whom she was riding; who, by the way, when they were attacked, had shown no lack of spirit or manly courage. The quick-witted, youth was quite right in hI'is prognostication; Sir William had ' observed the suspicious conduct of the 5word-dancers, and also the condition of the Lady of' Lawford's escort, as they were leaving the gate; of the monastery. He therefore determined to follow, although at a respectful distance, being .unwilling to thrust his company upon the ladies, but ready to'afford assistance, should oppor- tunity offer.   .         .  ., ',    .  .              .{   "   THE LADY OF LAWFORD. ,i.

She had, in accordance with the ,  ustom of the age, offered prayers at the shrine of Saint Nicholas. What marvel; then, that the series of wonderful events consequent on her pil- grimage should be ascribed to the power- ful intercession of the good Saint Nicholas! That, heaven had, sent Sir William  in response to her prayers seemed to be foreshadowed in  the very motto borne I     on his shield:,  Omne bonum Dei donum.

And  did not every, one say that it, would be a- sin and shame to, reject so gallant a knight-a boon for which she had so earnestly prayed? For once everybody was right, and the match which everybody said was made in heaven was soon consummated on earth. Merrily rang out the marriage-bells from the,tower of Pipewell Abbey, on a fine morning in the succeeding Easter holidays, when the fair Lady of Lawford, led by her chosen knight, fulfilled, before the high altar; the vow she had piously made at the shrine of the good Saint Nicholas.   / .

CHAPTER I. NEWBOLD UPON AVON. "Your wiser choice prefers this spot of earth, Distinguish'd by th' immortal Shakespeare's birth; Where through the vales the fair Avona glides And nourishes' the glebes with fattening tides." -SOMERVILLE. ABoUT thirty years since, when I was a junior partner in thefirm of J. Osborne & Co., Leeds, I made a visit to an old friend of mine, a clergyman in Warwickshire, who had been a schoolfellow. Frank Skipwith was the curate of New- bold-upon-Avon, and in the absence of the incumbent- for those were the days of plu- ralities and non-residence -resided in the ,f4        SMRVLE   62 1    LAWFORD HALL. parsonage, which was just such a house as a man of his antiquarian tastes would natu- rally select. It had a projecting stone porch, ; overgrown with ivy, and study windows looking out upon the churchyard and the village green. The eminence upon which the village of Newhold stands, commands a beautiful and extensive prospect on every side; the gently-flowing Avon meanders  ,  through a valley of luxuriant verdure, and in. the distance may be seen the spire of thie church at Bilton, a village once the ruial home of Addison. - My friend, Mr. Skipwith, although of aristocratic connections, lived on a footing of easy familiarity, not only with the gentry, but also With the farmers and small ',trades- men of the parish; and as he was of a genial, sociable disposition, he had picked up among them, in the course ofhis pere-  grinations, a large amount. of traditional lore; together with a collection of. old songs and ballads, which a Percy or a Ritson a   ,  ; ,  ,  *  *  ,  , iit   "AwFORD HALL.,     63     i might have envied. And yet Frank Skip-  with was not one of those black-letter anti- .  quaries, content, like misers, to gloat over  their literary treasures in the privacy of their  studies; on the contrary, he endeavored, both by precept and example, to revive  and perpetuate such ancient customs, sports,  and pastimes' as were innocent in them-  selves.  In his reverence- for the olden time the  curate did not go so far as actually to read  from the desk in church, King James's "Book of Sports," as his predecessors in the seventeenth century had done; but then  -  he. in a measure demnified himself for this restraint by conning over its pages in pri-' : vate, and by unofficially advocating its sacred  precepts, with such modifications as the    - times required. Not only did women "'have leave to carry  . - ; rushes to the church for the. decoring of it,  according to their old custom," but garlands of evergreens and flowers were- no less   "'     LAWFORD HALL. religiously provided for the May-pole, which from time immemorial had stood in the' village green "The good people were not disturbed, letted, or discouraged, from any lawful recreation, such as dancing, either for men or women; archery for men, leap- ing, vaulting, or any other such harmless recreations; nor from having of May Sames, Whitsun Ales, and Morrice-dances, provided, always, that such festivals were not held on a Sunday." But" the royal injunction that those only should enjoy "this benefit and Liberty," lho had. first been to church, he found more difficult, to enforce; people being rather slow to admit that those were unwor- thy of recreation who would not "first come to thechurch and serve God."  However, as the school-children formed the greater part of the congregation at these week.,day services, there was not much.,dispute about the matter, especially as the older people were, for, the most part,       "AWFQRD HALL.       65 content to be mere spectators, looking on the whole affair as a sort of dramatic enter- tainment, gotten up for their delectation. It was at one of these joyous: festivals that I happened to be staying with my  friend; and I well remember the Morrice- dance, which was a curiosity in its way. It' was Whitsun-Monday, and I was-told that ,the performers were a band of itinerants, who -were dancing their way from parish to parish, as if in emulation of Kempe, who, in days of yore, accompanied by Tom Sly, the piper, danced all the way from London to Norwich.*             But our dancers were from Herefordshire, "The exploit took place in 1599. Will Kem'pe pub- lished an account of his "Nine Daies' Wonder, from London to Norwich,"containing his "pleasure, paines, and kind entertainmerlt," and dedicated it to one of Queen Elizabeth's Maids of Honor. The "New- jigg" rivalledl- in popularity his Peter, in Romeo and Juliet; Dogherry, i-n Much Ado about Nothin-g, and Justice Shallow, of which he was th'e original 'per- former.               -   : o.       -.

Indeed, my friend, 'the curate, assured me that the performers were the lineal descendants of 'that sam'e Old Meg, who, with her light-heeled brethren to the,num- ber of a-round dozen, danced at the lo rse- races of-Hereford in the time of James I. The piper, w-ho chanced: to hear the remark, confirmed the statement; adding that the i well-battered tabor'which he had been vig- iorously thumping, was the identical instru- I ment borne by Old Hall himself, on that memorable occasion, It had made bach- elors and lassies dance round the Maypole threescore summers, one after another, in order; and, said he, it is not even yet worm eaten. "O wonderful pyper! O admirable ta- bor-ma!" exclaimed he--being somewhat   "AWFORD HALL.       .67       :i?  elevated, by exercise, or possibly, by home-  brewed ale, 'the people of Herefordshire are beholden, to thee; thou givest the men light hearts by thy pype, and the women  light heels by thy tabor." *         ' The Morrice-danqe was one of the most popular' merriments of Old England.  The characters were Robin Hood, Little John, Friar Tuck, Maid Marian, the Queen or Lady of the May, the fool, the piper,  ,  : the dragon, and the hobby-horse. Says, a humorous account of the Hereford- Races, above alluded to, published in i6o09: "There were, from a bill of candidates sufficient to impanel three or four juries, selected twelve Morrice- - dancers, the sum of whose ages was, -in the aggregate, twelve hundred years. Besides these were the fiddler,  the piper, and four whistlers; 'So, here are eighteen '  persons who' carrie in all places' about .them. eighteen hundred and thirty-seven years.'

THE HAUNTED HOUSE. "O'er all there hung a shadow and a fear; A sense of mystery ithe spirit daunted And-said; as. plain as whisper in the ear, The place is haunted."S HOOD.  As I resided for some time with the curate, occupying a   cheerfully furnished room, in what seemed the very bea  ziZdea  of a' quiet country parsonage, I learned many particulars in reference to,the vicinity. Indeed, the   neighborhood  abounded in  " objects of-interest, for, besides Stratford arid ' Charlecotte Hall, there were the ruins of Kenilwortlh, the-Castle and Church of War- wick and Combe Abbey, the early home of Elizabeth, Queen  of Bohemia. A But the chief object of interest to me was Lawford   "AWFORD HALL.      69   ,  - i Hall, the homes of the Boughtons, of War- wickshire, a family founded, according to local tradition, by a Burgundian soldier of for- j tune, who had served in the army of Ed- ward III. Indeed, the descendants of the Boughtons of Burgundy are a -numerous progeny, dis- persed abroad like, the children of, Israel, or rather. like the vine,-to use a more grateful simile, they have "taken iroot downward, and borne fruit upward," in many other lands. besides that of their own native Burgundy. The house of which I speak " was built by Edward Boughton, Esqpire, in the time of Queen Elizabeth, from a. Cistercian monas- - Itery, which he had pulled down that it might furnish the requisite materials. - As usual, bad luck had followed the demolition of ant edifice which -had been solemnly consecrated to the 'service of God; for not only did the founder of the Hall lose his right hand in a manner which, considering the sacri- lege committed, seemed like a judg'ment  70     L AW'FORD HALL. upon him, but from the day of his death, the room in which he died had the reputa- M tion of being haunted by the unlucky house- I builder himself; whose shade, in spite of all I laws, human or divine, continued to linger about its earthly habitation for two centuries l after his body had been consigned to the family vault, beneath the chancel of the church at Newhold. The "One-handed Boughton," as he has ever since been called, had been in his life- time high-sheriff of the county, besides sit- ting in Parliament as one of the knights of the shire, but unfortunately for his reputation, and for the rest of his soul, he had obtained from the Queen, through the favor of the Earl of Leicester, an order for the pulling down  of the Church of the White Friars, Coventry, for the Queen, flattered by the reception she  had met with at Kenilworth, was not in a humor for refusing the Earl so small a favor as that- of tie destruction of a church. I learned all these ,particulars from my   ,LAWFORD HALL.     71     i friend the curate, who, at my request, took me over to See the place. The housekeeper at the Hall received us with the greatest respect, throwing open the window-shutters, and -uncovering the antique furniture, that -we might see eerything to the best advan- tacge. The family did not reside at the Hall; indeed, it had not been occupied for many years, except by a, few servants and- the ghost I have mentioned, that, according to ancient precedent, had established itself in the best room in the house; a weird apart- ment, which, after some hesitation, we were also'permitted to see. The faded tapestry and high-backed, claw-footed chairs had a forsaken and: dreary look. Over the man- ; tel-piece we observed a portrait of a man, in slouched hat and feather, who seemed to be concealing a hand beneath the folds of his cloak. This, we were told in a whisper, was the portrait of the One-handed Bough- ton himself. ; The room was spacious, and in    72     LAWFORD' HALL. an alcove a: one end was a canopied bed- stead, whichh stood on a raised dais; the fur- niture all seemed to be Venetian, and, oppo- site the fireplace was a species of sofa, which had very much the look of an antique sarcophagus, or altar-tomb, with the addition of arms and back - of dark' wood fancifully carved. On -our return to the inhabited 'part of the house, we traversed a,long gallery, from the walls of which portraits of sev- eral generations of, the Boughton family seemed to look down upon us reproach- fully, as if our echoing footsteps had dis- turbed their .solemn repose. ;In the housekeeper's room we found Iunch provided for us. As we sipped our t tea, the venerable lady who presided over the establishment gradually waxed com- municative. The present baronet, she in- formed us, 'had not resided at the Hall'since the mysterious death of his cousin, Sir Theo- dosius. The untimely end of that you g / '  '  -  '  '  "  ' -  ,?  \   .,. *   "AWFORD HAL.'   73 ,   gentleman-by poison as. was believed-and the consequent tragic events, had cast a set- tled! gloom over the Hall--never, with its haunted chamber, a very cheerful abode- that made it'intolerable as a family residence. The 'house was, therefore, grafdually falling into decay, and there were rumors that it,- was shortly to be pulled down. A "These circumstances, as you may well imagine, increased the superstitious fears. of the servants and tenantry of the neighbor- hood; so that all the half-forgotten stories. about the 'haunted chamber, and the One- handed Boughton, were speedily revived. The servantswould not go alone about the house after-nightfall; and some of them were'" ready to swear that, on stormy nights, they had either seen or heard the One-handeUd Boughton, in his traditional coach-and-six, :driving furiously through the long avenues' of the park. "I found that the old housekeeper, be-- ing. Methodistically inclined, thought, with  ,74     LAWFORD HALL. John Wesley, that it was heresy to doubt the reality of such spiritual visitations. But why a ghost should travel about in a coach-and-six, it was difficult for her to explain; unless it was, as she said, to punish the spirit for its pride and luxury while in the flesh. Willing to humor the old lady, I asked if nothing had ever been done to quiet this restless ghost? 'Oh, yes,' she said; 'in my'grandmother's time an attempt was' made which was then believed to have been successful. ;The clergy of the vicinity, in their surplices, with psalms -and prayers, bad regularly exorcised the house, and park, securing the perturbed spirit in a bottle, and depositing it inT a neighboring pond.* That pond no one afterward was allowed to disturb.   \ "',But, alas,' said she, 'these exorcisms seem, to be in vain! for since the, ,sickness-- and death of my'late 'master, the ghost has reappeared, and like the evil spirit mentioned  * See Appendix I.   in the Gospel, "finding the house swept and garnished," has taken. to it seven other devils worse than himself. "' I dare say,' continued the housekeeper, turning to the curate, your reverence can recollect the horrors of that awful time; and how sorely the Doctor was tried, on the night Sir Theodosius died, when,- with fool- hardy courage, he insisted upon sleeping in the haunted chamber.' "(Why, yes,' said the curate, (and the old Doctor is still alive, and would, I dare say, give us an account of his adventure. He was professionally called to' attend upon the young baronet, and was also one of the witnesses at the trial of Captain Donellan, the convicted poisoner of Sir Theodosius.

THE STORY OF THE ONE-HANDED BOUGHTON. "A jolly place," said he, "in the times of old, But something ails it now; the spot is curst." WORDSWORTH. THE next day, the village doctor dined with. us, and the curate, having 'broached the subject of'the haunted 'chamber, together with a bottle of his best port, prevailed upon him to  give us an account of his experience. "Gentlemen," said he, ,(" the. subject' of your inquiry is a painful one, and, out of -regard for the feelings of the Boughton family, I seldom refer to it.

"On the 20th of August, I780, I was called on, to prescribe for Sir Theodosius Boughton, of Lawford Hall. -As the symp- toms were peculiar and rather complicated, I consented, at the request of his mother, Lady Boughton, to remain all night fat the Hall. In the discussion that followed, as to- what. apartment I should occupy, the haunt- ed room happened to be mentioned, and being somewhat younger than I am now, I at once claimed and obtained the honor of an adventure in that celebrated guest-, or rather 'ghost,' chamber. The housekeeper endeavored to dissuade me from the attempt; and; to that end, served up; with a substan- tial supper, a number of 'raw-head and bloody-bone' stories, sufficient to have dig- turbed the slumbers of any one nervously disposed, or at all given to superstitious terrors. But as I was not troubled with any such weakness, they had little effect upon me; indeed, I could not have drawn back had I been so disposed, having sought the   ,a             $ .

And yet, I must confess, as I  - surveyed the unfrequented apartment to which I was conducted, that, in spite of my philosophy, I'felt some inward qualms, such as I recollect having experienced in my. childhood when passing a lonely church- yard at night. The grim  picture of.,the  One-handed Boughton over the. chimney- piece, which, by the uncertain light of the bed-room candle, seemed about to thrust the bloody stump of its :handless arm into one's face; the funereal look of the canopied bed-' stead, as it stood in its shadowy, recess, and the tomb-like Venetian sofa,--all together cast a damp upon my spirits, which in vain  I endeavored to shake off. ; However, 'I sat down at the table, intending to read awhile before retiring, having brought with me a volume by Sir Henry 'Spelman,. which  I had picked up, as I passed through the library, attracted by the name of the author. I opened the book, but I was struck with awe on observing the title, 'De Non Te- , 4       '   ' '" o      .      -  ^  ,  ';.

'Who 'knows but that the reading of such a book in this place might act like'a charm or spell,. for the ghost of the man whose picture hangs 'over the fireplace is said to walk disquieted, on account of the sac- rilegious act committed by. him in pulling down the White Friars' Church.' "I was soon deep in the records of judg- ments and misfortunes, which, according to Spelman, had befallen the families of those  who had despoiled the property of the /Chlurch, fenced and guarded by the most awful anathemas. :'In the midst of these studies, I was aroused from my medita- tions by a sound which seemed like a hol- low groan, and which made the blood curdle in my veins. I hesitated to look up, for I felt oppressed, as if something uncouth and hideous must be I ooking-over my shoulder. IPresently the groan was 'I    \8 O           -  - r 80     LAWFORD HALL. repeated' and then, with a sudden effort, I , sprang to my feet. As I did so, I saw, in the dimn lighllt of my diminishing candle, a dark fig re silently glide toward the win- dow. The cold shiver again ran over me; however, I stealthily approached the' ob- ject, and discovered, to my great relief, that it was only my own shadow! On. throwing open the casement the groan was once more repeated, as if the object 'from which it proceeded was directly over me. I looked up, and perceived that the cause of the disturbance might have pro-f ceeded from a ,branch of an elm, which rubbed against the frame of the window. "The wind was sighing and moaning through the trees; the moon occasionally broke through the drifting clouds, which ' seemed to be gathering for a storm; the flitting of bats about the old house, and the' boding -cry of an owl from the hollow of an oak-tree in the neighborhood, did not add at all to the cheerfulness of the "   "AWFORD HALL.     8I ;  situation. As I drew in my head, I found , that my candle had been blown out, per- haps by a puff of wind from the open window; although, in the 'moonlight, it seemed to my excited imagination that the bed-curtains in the distant alcove were moved as if, by an invisible hand. Relighting my candle, I drew my chair up to the fire, which had been made on account of the dampness., It was a cushioned arm-chair, and I determined to pass the night in it, as it seemed to me preferable to either 'the lugubrious sofa, or the even more lugu- brious bed. Now, I must say, in explana- tion, that I was unused to ,eating late sup- pers, and it may be that the cold ham, anclhovy'toast, and brandy-and-water I had taken to wash them down withal, may have added to the depression produced by the sur-, roundings. But, whatever may have been the exciting cause, natural or supernatural, certain ; it is, that I, passed a very uncomfortable night, and one that I would not willingly repeat.

I was gradually fall-  ing into a state of unconsciousness, when  I felt a quaking and trembling of the 'floor,  as if some ponderous body :had suddenly   dropped upon 'it. Atain, a feeling of op- i pression came over ine, and I held my   i breath in a state of a ful expectation. At length 'I ventured to look up; iri the cen- tre of the apartment stood some one in an antiquated costume, the very counterpart of the picture over the mantel-piece. All that I had, ever heard about the One-handed Boughton noir flashed upon my mind. ' In 'God's name,' said I, in a hoarse and husky voice, ' who and what are you?' "'Few and far between,' whispered a voice, 'have been thpse who, during the 'two hundred years that, my perturbed spirit, has wandered about this earthly abode, have dared to ask 'that question., Alas'! had any: listened to the warnings I \ ' ^ ,  . l     '     "AWFORD HALL.      83   gave, misfortunes and calamities that' have befallen my unhappy descendants might  have been averted, and my own disturbed   ,  spirit might have found rest, for truly the sins of the fathers are visited upon  the children;" yea, for my punishment, one ' was slain at Naseby, his Ihorse returning   :' from the fight without' a  rider;, another   i:' wandered in foreign lands in extreme des- titution; and .a third suffered from cruel suspicion, what time England went mad  over the Popish Plot.

Does not another calamity, create ap all, now threaten the heir of  Lawford Hall? for, when murder has been committed, the curse of the Church, which, for two'hundred years, has hung over this house, will have culminated, so that the very stones sacrilegiously used in it, shall cry out against them, and henceforth be  accounted of all men most unholy., Haste, then, to my descendants; .up! fear not for myself, but charge them that theyfly thi    84     LAWFORD HALL. place'; and would they escape worse con- sequences, ,and free my soul from its earthly bondage, let them not leave here one stone upon another.' "Then  the phantom, stretching forth from the- folds of his cloak the stump of an arm, from, which, issued a lambent flame that seemed to assume the form of the lost hand, glided toward the door, which noisdlessly opened. as the spectre approached; and I, determined to know whether I Was sleeping or waking, arose and hastily followed it. "As we--passed through the long gal- lery to the grand staircase, I found that the house was brilliantly illuminated, and-' that the apartments were filled with- a company of people in antiquated costume, staring at. us with wan countenances and- lack-lustre eyes, as if the portraits that gar- nished the walls had stepped down from their frames to join in what seemed a dismal masquerade. - I A ,.   "AWFORD HALL.      85 "A coach, drawn by: six horses, whose long tails swept the gr6und, was standing before the open door of the Hall. Into the carriage stepped the apparition; swift as the wind the horses rushed down the avenue;, with equal swiftness I followed; nor did the equipage pause until we reached the. village church of Newhold. In a moment'the phantom had descended, and, with loud, knocks, was thundering at the door of a crypt beneath the chancel of the church, where for centuries had reposed the. mortal remains of the Bough- tons of Lawford Hall. The blows were rapid and furious, and grew louder' and louder. The door rattled .on its rusty hinges, and at length was burst in by the violence of the assault." Then there was a moment of 'confusion, a clattering of hoofs and a rattling of wheels. Some one shook me violently by the shouldersf; and I found myself-not in the churchyard at Newhold, but in the old tapestried arm-chair. , . b   86     LAWFORD HALL. "The butler,/the housekeeper, and Cap- tain Doneilan--brother-in-law of the young baronet-were standing over me, wonder' ing that I had not heard them pounding on the door, which at last they had been obliged to- force open, thinking that I must either have fallen into a fit or been spirited, away by the goblin that haunted the chamber.  "i Sir Theodosius; they told me, had grown suddenly worse, and alarried at the turn the malady was taking, thenr had come for me. I administered soe lpowders, care- fully compounded, which had often proved efficacious in difficult cases, and remained with him until the morning, when I was -obliged to return to the village. , "The remedies administered were, how- ever, unavailing, for in the course of the day i learned, very much to my surprise, that Sir Theodosius was dead.

Captain Donellan, with his wife, Sir Theodosius's only sister, was at the Hall; and people recollected that, as the baronet was a minor, his demise might be to the Captain's advantage. "A post-mortem examination was held, and celebrated London practitioners deXV cldared that Sir Theodosius had been poi- ' soned. Circumstantial evidence pointed to Donellan. I need not dilate on the trial which followed the accusation; Captain Donellan was convicted and executed; sol- ermnly protesting his-innocence to the last. There were many, however, who doubted the justice of hanging a man on mere cir- cumstantial evidence; but the mystery has never yet been cleared up,. "Sir Theodosius was succeeded in the title and estate, by his cousin Sir William, i the present baronet. The family evidently * See Appendix II.   88  '   LAWFORD HALL. have. shunned the Hall; Sir William, only, occasionally driving over from the inn at Rughy. As for the. message of the One- handed Boughton, it was some time before ,I could make up, my mind to' deliver it. "At length, urged on by my confidante, the housekeeper, I ventured 'io broach the  Subject. The baronet at first laughled at what he called our superstitious .fears,  ' although he admitted that the room iln question had, from the days of Queen Elizabeth, an evil reputation.. 'Provoked by the tone of incredulity, I boldly, suggested that the baronet himself should try the adventure of a night in the haunted chamber. But to this the house-  l keeper strenuously objected, sayingr that wing of the house had been'virtually closed since the tragic end of the unfortunate .I Captain Donellan, for the servants could not be prevailed upon to go near it.

( (It'is sing ular,' said the baronet to me, unheeding the housekeeper's remark, 'that your story should coincide with a sort of prophecy I discovered in manuscript, when I first came down here to take possession. The prediction' in question seems to have   been made by the famous Count de Cag- liostro, the last, and some say the great- est of the Rosicrucian philosophers. The Count, when in England, was once lodged in that same haunted chamber; he doubt- less selected the room on account of its ghostly reputation, as he claimed to have identified himself with those celestial intelli- gences which, through the planets, govern     :his earth of ou'rs. With the exception of yourself, the Count was, I believe, the last person that ever occupied the room, and  t was there I found the manuscript.

Cagliostro as it was to Zoroaster: or Nos- tradamus. Curiously enough, he proved to be a true' prophet. The horoscope of Sir Theodosius, which he had cast, pre- dicted an early death and great family misfortune. "'I myself,' continued the baronet, 'be- lieve the Count ito have been a charlatan 'and an impostor. He pretended to be in  possession of the philosopher's stone, and to rival Methuselah in years. He is said to have done many wonderful thilings, both in England and on the Continent, which seem only explicable on the principles of magic, Five times in succession, I knew of his foretelling the, lucky number in the lot- tery; indeed, an action was brought against him and his countess, in London, for sor- cery and witchcraft, and foretelling the fortu- nate. numbers in the lottery by the aid of the devil. Were there anything in the   science of animal magnetism, in which that Rosi-   "AWFORD HALL;'.     91 crucian philosopher 'was also an adept, I should say that if not laboring under a  nightmare, you must have been in a clair- voyant state, produced by sleeping in the old arm-chair, magnetized by the Count, and that while you were in an entranced state, you must have made yourself ac- quainted with the contents of the packet, which, all the while, was lying in a concealed drawer of the table near you.' "The baronet, I afterward' ascertained from my friend the housekeeper, attempted to exorcise the haunted room by sleeping in it. The result of that nocturnal' experi- ment I never learned; the housekeeper preserving a mysterious silence upon the subject. It is said, however, that the Hall is soon to be razed to the ground and the estate sold. It seems a pity that so vener- able a mansion should be pulled down, but then the ghost of the founder will rest in peace; although at night, when distant carriage-wheels arel heard, the   92     LAWFORD HALL. coUntry-people will, doubtless, still continue to quiet their restless children by saying, T'Iush! there  comes the One-handed Boughton in his coachll-and-six.'"

"But 'w"hat do yozY think of the Doctor's  story?" said I, turning-to the curate as soon  as tne door was closed.  "I,I' said -mny reverend friend, " hardly *See Appendix I.

ONP day,: while I was staying at the par- sonage, the curate and Hwalked oer to the little village of Bilton, where I had the honor of an introduction to Mrs. Addison, a venerable maiden lady, who still continued to reside i the house once occupied by her illustrious father, At Bilton many of Ad- dison's papers for the "Spectator" were composed, and there is a long straight wal4 of beautiful Spanish chestnuts and oaks, planted by the poet's own hand, where tra- dition says he loved to walk.   "AWFORD HALL.     95 'ILam inclined to think," said the curate, as we paced up 'and down this shady ave- nue, " that Addison must have had Lawford Hall in mind when he described the house of Sir Roger de Coverley. The paper, in the 'Spectator,' on 'Ghosts and Appari- tions,' seems to apply to Lawford Hall; and what strengthens this supposition. is that it was written in I17 I, thee very year Addison purchased the estate from a son of Sir Wil- liam Boughton. Indeed, Sir Roger de Cov- erley's account of his house, on taking possession, might 'answer very well for a description of Lawford Hall as it now is; and, if we may believe report, as 'it was in Addison's time. '"The best room in it," said Sir Roger, "( had the reputation of being haunted; and by that means was locked up., Noises also ,hadbeen heard in the- long -gallery, so that he could not get a servant to enter it after nightfall. Again, --the exorcising of' the house by the chaplain of the good knight, , ^ '  ' *  '  *  , .   96     LAWFORD HALL. ' who lay in every room one after another, is an idea which may have been suggested by the fact that about that time Lawford Hall was actually exorcised by a numerous body of the clergy." "How would you account,' inquired I, "for- the origin of the superstitious notions that have so long hung round Lawford Hall?" "Why, you know," said he, "that the house was built from materials procured by the demolition of a Cistercian Mon'astery, and there is a widespread popular belief that those who plunder the Church will, sooner ,or later, either in themselves or in 'their heirs,-be signally punished for the sacrilege Spellman saysthat, in ancient times, who-,1 ever gave any lands or endowments to the service of God, gave it with much form and t. ceremony, the deed was sealed and -wit-, nessed, and'tendered super altare by the donor on his knees, and-following the ex- ample of Darius-the founder imprecated a   "AWFORD HALL.      97 most heavy curse on those who violated or withdrew his gifts. "This solemn dedication was well calcu- lated to create, in the minds of the vulgar a feeling of awe, although, indeed, reverence for consecrated places seems to be innate; for in all ages and in all religions, the tem- ples of the gods have been accounted holy and inviolable. "The dissolution of the monasteries in the, sixteenth century," continued the curate, "was an event that greatly affected the pop- ular mind; for, despite the irregularities of the clergy, the rural population of England had a great reverence for the venerable sanctuaries where they and their forefathers had worshipped for centuries. They, there- fore, beheld with sorrow and dismay the' demolition of those ancient minsters, whose architectural glory excited even the admira- tion of foreigners; they called to mind the curse invoked by the monastic founders, looking upon the misfortunes which befel  *  .       .   98     -LAWFORD HALL. those who had plundered them, as righteous judgments from heaven-the natuial conse- quence of the sacrilege- committed. "'Hence' the stories about Lawford Hall, and its unlucky founder, the One-handed Boughton. "'The old house, as the Doctor says, is really to be pulled down as soon as the steward, can find laborers to assist in the work; for, curiously enough, there is a notion b abroad that it would be unlucky for any one to meddle with the sacred i stones of Lawford Hall."

CHAPTER   I. 'What's to be done; how can I cure ; This restless something I endure?" SYNTAX IN SEARCH OF A WIFE, RICHARD INGRAM (said my reverend com- panion) was rector of the parish of New- bold-upon-Avon, at the time of the breaking out of the great rebellion, and was one of. those devoted rural parsons wose merito- rious conduct has been recorded by Walker, in, his "History of the Sufferings of the Clergy."     -  He was a graduate of St. John's College, V Cambridge, and came to Newhold on taking \    o04    PARSON INGRAM. ,  his degree. As he had faithfully dischargedI  the duties of the curacy for many years   I previous to the period mentioned, he was, on the demise of the octogenarian incum-  ' bent, promoted to the rectorship. At the'  same time his worldly position had been fur-  ther improved by a bequest of five thousand pounds, which, in the seventeenth century, waps an important item even to a beneficed   clergyman.  - Among the conse ences of this addition to his fortune, was the necessity of at once taking up his abode at the parsonage.     I Now, it seems that an increase of dirg- nity--as is' often the case in this world- -  X did not result in an increase of ease; for, being a bachelor approaching middle age, he missed, in his new residence, the accus'  tomed lively prattle of the children of the good village dame, in whose house he had lodged.     - Moreover, the ordering of a household' , befitting his changed circumstances, was, in  I  ,   .' *'^*;i   PARSON INGRAM.   ,  105 I itself, the cause of much doubt and dis- quietude. The obvious remedy for such a state of, thingrs was, as everybody said, to take unto himself a 'wife. But the parson was consti- tutionally, and from habit, shy and reserved, knowing but little of ithe world, or rather, of its ways. Indeed, his straitened circumstances when a curate had been such as to6 make the holy estate of matrimony something not to be thoughlt 0Iat least in his own case. When, therefore, at the mature age of thirty-six, he for the first time began to contemplate a subject of which most men think at an earlier period, he chose, as might have been expected, as the object of his preference, a young lady of less than half his own age, a resident of Lawford Hall, who, although, beautiful and accomplished, was content with an humble position in the household-- something between that of lady's companion and nursery-governess.   io6     PARSON INGRAM. 1 Domestic 'iservice in tlose days, in an ' honorable house like that of Lawford Hall,   was not thought degrading to young people  ; of gentle birth. For, under the Feudal   i system--not yet entirely passed away--peo-  ple of birth ,and breeding might wait upon  , each other whenever circumstances made    , such an arrangement convenient.       :: Lucy Woolford, the heroine of the story, was an orphan, the posthumous child of one of those--English gentlemhen who distin-  guished themselves by their gallantr endeav-  ors to maintain Frederic, Count Palatine, on I the throne of Bolhemia.

On the marriage of the Princess with the  ; Count Palatine, she accompanied them to Heiddlberg. After the 'Elector's elevation to the throne of Bohemia, she married a    i young officer' who had served with distinc- tion.

X His wife, however, remained in the service    1 of the Queen of Bohemia, whose fortunes, or misfortunes, she continued to share until her own death \some years later at the Hague. With her, latest breath she com- mended Lucy, her only child, to the care of her royal mistress. The Queen, being at that time in straitened circumstances, gladly availed herself of the kind intervention of Lord Craven, who carried the child with him to England. There, providentially, he soon found a home for her in-the family of his neighbor, Sir William Boughton, for Sir Wiliam and his good lady, being on a visit to Lord Craven at Comge Abbey, were charmed with the grace and beauty of the child, and having no daughter of their own, gladly assented to receive the orphan at Lawford Hall. Lucy Woolford-heiress to nothing but her father's name and fame--hbeing \,thus provided for, endeavoredi,as she grew up, to ,   108     PARSON' INGRAM.  repay, in a variety of ways, the kindness of   those who had befriended 'her. Sir Wil-    X ; liam's eldest son was seldom at. the Hall, being either at school or college;, but his' younger brothers were of an age to profit  by her care and instruction. To them, therefore, she chiefly devoted her time andl : attention; and they soon learned to look up  to Lucy as to an elder sister.    '  , Such was- the situation of'affairs at the Hall in the year i642, when my predeces-   , : solr, newly arrived at the dighity of rector,  X first seriously, thought of taking unto him- self a wife. You need not wonder at his    ! indiscretion in fixihg hllis affections on one so much younger than; himself. Indeed, the poor man had been but little in request, for, as I said before, being of a retiring, studious , disposition, he had not seen muclh of the- world; his experience in good society hav- .  d ing been almost restricted to the Sunday dinner at the Hall; fo'r the -baronet--after the good old English fashion-was accus-     , a 1    , .

To be  sure, there were others in the parish much more mature in years, who might very well have been chosen to reside at} the Par- sonage. Report-that ill-natured jade--said that there were already several aspirants for the honor, for six or4 seven hundred a year would have made even one of the laity eligible; how much more, then, a clergy- man with a fair prospect of ecclesiastical promotion. My reverend predecessor, therefore, could have had no difficulty in suiting himself with a wife, for his parishioners, wtlh. a wonderful unanimity, were now ready to help him with counsel and advice. Some- how, the parson's change of fortune seemed all at once to give a new impulse to Church affairs in Newhold.' The old parish church, which had been gradually falling into decay, suddenly put on its beautiful garments;   I IO     PARSON INGRAM.

"Lucy is ill at ease,' in thoughts from the visions of the night;' being wakeful and restless,'she had gone to the window;, which looked out on the park. From the balcony, she beheld in the air a shining cloud, of the brightness of the moon, and of a shape resembling a sword, the point reaching to the North toward Leicestevhere the king and his army were encamped. "While she was observing, and wonder- ing what this might portend, she heard the heavy roll of wheels, and presently, on turn- ing, beheld issuing from the deep shadow of tle wood, a acoach drawn by six headless horses, driven by a headless coachman. "In her terror, she cried aloud for help. The assistance summonied by the call found    128     PARSON INGRAM. her on the floor in a swoon.

But alas! our fears, so far from being imaginary, were but too well founded; for, in the midst of our per- plexity we heard the sharp clatter' of horse's feet, and on looking out of a window, per- ceived the noble steed of our gallant young Colonel, galloping wildly through the park, his bridle dangling 'at his feet, and the empty war-saddle stained with blood.

It appears from the diary, that the parson continued to maintain his ground at New- bold, after the battle of Naseby, until he was expelled from the parish by a party of Cromwell's Ironsides, for preaching a ser- mon on the "Divine Right of Episcopacy," in defiance of parliamentary prohibition. He seems, however, to have remained in England until some time after, the death of Charles I., moving about from place to place in a rather mysterious manner, residing some- times in the neighborlhood ofiOxford, but chiefly at Lawford Hall, where, like many of his brethren in like Circumstances, he dis-  charged the duties of domestic chaplain. There is good reason to believe that he was concerned in some of those numerous plots which had for their object the restoration of, Charles II., and I infer, from documentary  I i     132; .

Among the consec uences of his seques- tration, was the abrtpt termination of the diary from which' I have quoted. i Fortunately, however, the manuscript was riot lost, for it had been thrust into' a corner by some friendly hand, on the sacking of the parsonage by the, fanatics. There, securely ensconced behind the panelling, it remained until recently, when it was accidentally dis- covered on t-he removal of the wainscoting.

IN the quiet serenity of Mrs. Van Wert's household at the Hague, Lucy Woolforcl, thanks to a kind Providence, and the elas- 'ticity of a good constitution, soon recovered her usual health and- spirits, althouglih her vivacity was in some measure softened and subdued by the sorrow she .had recently experienced. The recollection of those sad events, how- ever, gradually wore away.  Indeed, the revival of the natural gayety of her dispo- sition'seems to have disquieted, not a little, the motherly heart of Mrs. Van Wert. The beauty and accomplishments of the      134     PARSON INGRAM. young lady attracted many admirers, among  them a wealthy Meinheer, whose suit was warmly advocated by their mutual friends. Lucy, however, was in nowise inclined to  the match.      '  The prompt rejection of so good an offer seems to have taken her worthy pat- roness by surprise. In a letter to her, brother, who was still residing at Lawford Hall, where,-like another St. Paul, lie minis- tered unto such of his former charge as came unto him, she complains of the way-    I wardness of her fair charge, and asks for counsel and acvice. Soon after the receipt of the letter al- luded to, I find that Parson Ingram suddenly  absented -himself from the(Hall. As his movements were usually conducted with secrecy, nothing at first was thoulght of the disappearance. Indeed, it was not until  after the battle of Worcester, that the family  at the Hall began to feel uneasy as to his prolonged absence. It was now thought r ;           :          g   PARSON INGRAM.     135 that he might have become in some way entangled in the affairs lof the defeated royalists. However, they soon learned that he was suspected of being in the confidence of those who were hiding the king, and that a warrant had been issued for.-his appre- hension. Consequently, the arrest of Par- son Ingram at Rochester about six weeks aftier did not so much surprise as alarm The escape of the king after the battle of Worcester, in spite 'of the large reward offered for his capture, was the subject of much annoyance to Cromwell' government, and fearful was the punishment in store for those who should dare to hide or assist the fugitive. When, therefore, my reverend predecessor was brought before the military commission sitting at Rochester Castle, there was little chance of his obtaining either justice or mercy, unless he could clear himself of the            . -   136     PARSON 'INGRAM., charge of complicity with those contriving the escape of the Iking. He had been consigned to an upper chamber in the donjon keep, as if the security of three kingdoms depended upon his safe custody. Without fLunds or counsel, or even pen, ink, and paper, 'he waited two whole days, in cold and discomfort, in doubt and anxiety, without so much as knowing the offence with which he was" charged..  At length, on the I9th of October, I65I, he was brought down to the hall of the castle for a preliminary examination. In a large and lofty apartment was seated round a long table the military commission, before which he had been summoned to appear. , To the ordinary interrogatories as to his  : name;, profession,s and business in Rochester, he answered with readiness. But when questions were pult to him as to his'acquain- tance with the defeated royalists, he observed -a caution and circumspection in his answers, }                   , *   PARSON INGRAM.  '  I37  which deepened the distrust and suspicion with which hle was evidently regarded. In particular--"Did he Iknpw one Colonel Wyndham, who liad lately served in the army of Charles Stuart ' Had he seen him since the battle df Worcester? Within a fortnight? 'Within a week? Within three .... days?"i To all which questions my reverend predecessor reluctantly answered, "Yes." When, however, the president of the council proceeded, in a stern voice, with his ques- tions as to the person  and place of concealment of the young man, Charles Stuart, the parson positively refused to makle any further response. "We will find a Wvay to - make you speak out," said the presiding officer. So saying, he rang a little bell by his side, and immedi- ately a p6rtion of the arras, which covered one end of the apartment, was drawn aside, displaying a recess furnished with the rack and- other instrumenits of torture; for, in those days the medizeval way of extorting ; , *    "    *  .   f \   I38     PARSON INGRAM. testimony had not bee-n entirely abandoned. Again the question was put to the respon- dent, who again resolutely refused to answer. At a signal the executioner advanced to seize upon his victim. He was a brawny fellow, with bare arms, the natural ferocity of whose appearance was hl'eightened by the crimson livery he wore. With the assistance of the jailor he pro- ceeded to disrobe the parson of his outer garments. On examining, the coat the jailor discovered a secret pocket which had hitherto escaped notice; Ahastily opening it, he pro- duced- the letter Parson Ingram had ,re- ceived from Mrs. Van Wer't, the day before  he had left Lawford Hall. ' Colonel Ashton, the president of the council, appeared to be verymuch interested \ in the contents of the letter, whch, being read aloud, was as follows :  "Lucy Woolford, your parishioner, very much puzzles both my husband and myself.

Whilst he was speaking, a- messenger entered the room and. handed him a note; breaking the seal, he read it to the council. It was to the effect that Charles Stuart had Escaped, and lhad landed in Normandy. Tha news createda-great sensation. The 1 :; ! ** ! 1 ' ^  1; 1' f  ' *1;.    PARSON INGRAM.

Indeed, he even carried his complacency so far as to ask him to dinner. It was then, in cotfidential intercourse, that the parson learned the secret motive which prompted the Colonel's " change of front." It appeared that the'battle of Worcester had unexpectedly brought about a great im- provement in Lucy WToolford's position, for the last surivving 'son of Lord de ool- . ford, 5 Colornel in Cromwell's army, had died of .:the wounds received in that bloody battle. .    ;       ' Lucy therefore, was now heiress to the . ancient Barony de Woolford. Colonel Ashton also explained thatl his wife was related to the Woolford family; and it appeared that the project of uniting thee distant branches of the House of 'Woolford had suddenly occurred to him.

CONCLUSION. 'It was amid the ringing of bells and the blazing of bonfires, consequent on the happy restoration of King Charles II., that my reverend predecessor again took possession of this parsonage, from which he had been expelled twelve years before. A short time after, Charles II., hot alto- getlher unmindfiil of services in the royal cause, promoted Parson Ingram tot:a deanery in the neighboring, city of Peterborough. To be sure, there were those about the Courtill-natured enough to whisper that he was more indebted to Lucy's beauty for the promotion, than to any particular merit that the king had discovered in him. But the new dean heeded not such re-  ,        . , ,  f I 8    150     PARSON INGRAM. marks, if indeed they ever reached him; however, like a prudent man, he kept his fair wife away from Court. - Soon after their removal to the deanery, they received a fresh accession of dignity in the Barotny of Woolford Castle, for on the death of the old lord, the title and estate reverted to Lucy, In their new homes, thus happily provided, they lived for many years, the centre, as it were, of a rural court, over which Lucy presided with queenly grace and dignity.

CHAPTER I. ST. JOHN' S. OR MDSUMMER EVE. "Tis Midsummer Eve, the much-dreaded, desired  'Tis the mystical eve of the Baptist, St. John." HOME MYTHOLOGY. IT was in the month of June, i824, that I happened to meet, in a bookseller's shop, in : London, an old friend of mine, Nicholas Boughton, who had been my class-mate at Yale College. He was not of the Connecticut family of that name, with Iwhich I myself, claim kindred, "but the son of a widow of very limited ,means, who resided in a quiet village on the banks of the Hudson. We, his classmates, however, knew really very little about him, for being of a retiring " , 7*6 7*   I54    HDDEN TREASURE. disposition, or perhaps from motives of economy,' he had shunned society. We observed, nevertheless, that he was very fond ,of old books, old customs, and stories of the olden time; and that he spent most of his leisure hours in the library, pon- dering over the black-letter folios that had once belonged to Bishop Berkeley, one of the benefactors of the college. The musty, jnouldy, worm-eaten company he kept, seemed, somehow or other, to have affected his personal appearatnce; for he had an antiquated, old-fashioned look; and his dusty, threadbare coat savored very much of the cloister. Itemember he had the reputa- tion of being of a dreamy, visionary disposi- tion, rather given to tales of the marvellous and supernatural. 'While he and I were conversing about old times and our former associates, the shop- keeper handed me the book for which I had inquire .   '                'i It was Bracebridge Hall-a new work     3 1 '    ',            .. .1   HDDEN TREASURE.     55 . then making a great'stir in the literary world,s         ,  - - Carelessly turning over the pages of. the  volumes, my attention was arrested by the following words in the story of "The Stout , Gentleman," which, half consciously, I read aloud: "Men who have seen the' world, and been swornat Highgate."  "Why 'sworn at Highgate?'" said I, turn- ing to my friend, ( rather than at any other- -place?" Now, the study of old English local peculiarities had always been a favorite pursuit of his, and the question at once drew down upon me a learned'disquisition -on quaint manners and, customs, such as still lingered in. the outskirts of the metrop- olis. .                 I ' I Highgate, you should know," said he, "is  a sort of port of entry, through which people from?the North, bound for London, must pass; and' the mysterious oath alluded to by ,the author is not unlike a custom-house oath, in that it is not supposed to be of a very   156     HDDEN TREASURE.

"These, and similar weighty obligations are assumed by the neophytes; A coach they say seldom stops at any of the taverns without a few of the passengers being thus initiated, amidst the laughter of the rest.       I57- HDDEN TREASURE.     57 The landlord usuallyr acts as priest on the occasion, and a waiter performs the duty of clerk, singing out 'Amen'at all the proper places." As I expressed a strongy desiite to see something of this singular ceremony, he pro-  posed that I qhould join him on the follow- ing day, in'an excursion to Highgate, a place ' to whcich the Londoners, in searchof fresh   { air and amusement, frequently resort. '  "As it will be Midsummer Eve," said he,   . "there will be, doubtless, an unusual-con- course of people, with, perh ps, something of ,especial interest; for clubs and societies  often take advantage of the Midsummer  holidays to celebrate the admission of a new  i member into their brotherhood, by the ad- ministration of the mock oath, of which'we have been speaking. Moreover, you shall have, besides a good. dinner, at the Gate- house Inn, some account of my rambles, for, since I last saw you, I have been quite a  '  traveller.

The next day, accordingly, we took coach  X at Charing Cross, and, passing, along the. Strand, through Temple Bar, up Chancery' L;ne and Gray's Inn Road, we soon found ourselves on the Holloway Road, leading to Highgate.  We learned from the coachman tat the- Eccentric Club (St. Martin"s Lank) were  coming out in a body, to have a new mem- ber " sworn in " upon the Horns. :' . ' St. John's Eve, the day we had selected for our excursion, is one of the Midsum-7 mer , Holidays, formerly observ-ed by the -Londoners with great magnificence, and ithe  Eccentric Club, we were told, considered it their bounden duty to perpetuate the mem-' ory of its departed'glory.           As we drove into Highgate-a most pic- turesque- little village, with antique-looking t o' ,  ' Q  ,  ,     HDDEN TREASURE.    159 reets, and houses embosomed in vener- )le shade trees--we observed that the Club ere already assembled. ,  .i We were in time, however, to witness the remony of swearing upon the horns, and  e found that the attendant sports and pas-, mes were, as anticipated, of a quaint and arlesque character; such as would have elighted the heart of the venerable hero of ,racebridge Hall.         - Besides a foot-race run in sacks, and     - wrestling-match, and a competitive climb- Ig of a greased pole, there was a famous; /orris dance, in which Robin Hood and  Jlaid Marian played a distinguished part; "Nor was the hobby-horse forgot."    ! Indeed, the whole affair was as happily conducted as it could have been under the  nanagement of 'Master Simon himself.  ;' Having dropped a contribution into the   -: :ox borne, by one of the rustic performers, we returned to the Gate-house-Inn, where ',   160o    HDDEN TREASURE. our dinner had been ordered, and where, according to promise, my friend was to give me an account of his adventures since leav- ' ing college . After justice had been done to the good  things the landlord had provided for us, my friend Nick communicated to me the history of his life, for the circumstantial truth of  \ which he declared himself willing to be solemnly "sworn upon the horns." As for the Eccentric Club, they, with their invited guests of the gentler sex, continued I their Midsurfmmer revels far into the night.  From time to time we observed fairy-like  I beings; all in white; flitting across the gar-  den, and we ,could plainly hear them reciting, i the spell, '"Hemp seed I sow, hemp seed I hoe, and he that is my true love come after I me and mow." d  Their conjurations, however, did not ap- pear to produce, the spiritual manifestations proper to the ij ystical Eve of St. John, for the true loves evoked, judging from the, ! .            z.   HDDEN TREASURE.     06i rutiffness of their voices, were decidedly too ;ubstantial to have- come from fairy-land.  The night is ane greatly to be observed, especially by those wlo, like my friend Nick, :ultivated a love for the olden time, and its poetical associations, and who have a strong faith in the reality of that spirit-world, the denizens of which are said to hover about us either for good oor ill, at this particular season. "At this time," said Nick, " our pious fore- fathers, arrayed in white armor, with bon- fires and torches, used to watch the live-long  night; for in their minds the Nativity of St. - 'John the Baptist was as inseparably con- nected with that: of our Lord as were the solstices which symbolize them." Warmed into enthusiasm by the recollec- tion of the splendid: festivities of the March- in' Watch, he quoted the following lines from a poet of the seventeenth century: "Thy goodly buildings that till then did hide Their rich array, opened their windowes wide,   162  I   HDDEN TREASURE.

T     ,               ,w.  The  witching Midsummer, twilight had fallen upon us, as he repeated these lines. The roses and jessamine, twining about the open window, were shedding a grateful perfume around, whilst the narrative flowed smoothly on, like the wine we were drinking, 'in a gentle, quiet stream.   , ,CHAPTER II. "I am a traveller of the good old school, aid am fond of the custom laid down in books, according to which, whenever travellers met, they sat down forth- with, and gave a history of themselves and their adyent- ures."         WASHNGTON IRVING. You may have heard, said my old friend Nick, that, after leaving college, I accepted an invitation to go abroad with an elderly gentleman, who proposed to spend a winter in the sotuth of Europe. He wished to avail- himself of my knowledge of French, of which language, it seemed, he was entirely ignor- ant. I do not know that I ever mentioned to you that I was the eldest of a family of three children, and that my mother was a widow. We were poor, I should say, for my parents, emigrating from Europe to America shortly !            ,      5   .   i64    HDDEN TREASURE. before 1I was born, brought but little with , them; and that little was soon made less. My father dying some years after our ar- rival, we should have been quite destitute, had it not been for a rich uncle in England, who kindly sent my mother presents, some- times of money, sometimes of jewelry and plate.- These last-named .articles, I must confess, frequently found their way to an- other " uncle '" of ours, as that useful relation of the needy, the pawnbroker, has been called. At length, our English relative settled upon us a regular allowance suffi- cient for an economical support, and also for my education, enabling me to make my way in college. However, this timely aid was accepted with reluctance; for my mo- ther came of an old Alsatian family, who, before the Revolution, I789, had prided themselves not a little on their gentility; so it was resolved that this pecuniary assistance should be considered as a loan, to be repaid, if possible, at some future day., !   " 01     '    I    HDDEN TREASURE.     I65 A proposition to go abroad, therefore, was  not only agreeable, but seemed favorable to some rather visionary plans I had formed; for my father and uncle, although British by birth, were also connected, by some mys- terious tie, with an ancient French family, once rich and powerful, over'whose history in modern times there hung a veil of mys- tery. It may be providential, thought I, for I may find in Europe, the means of unravel-- ing this mystery, and of restoring our shat- tered fortunes. It was, then, in the summer of 1814, which, as you may recollect, was -the year I left college, that we set sail from New York. W  landed at Havre, and proceeded to aris, and thencf& to Italy, by the way of Nice. After spendiing the winter in Italy, we crossed the Alps into the Rhineland. The old gentleman with whom I was travelling, finding friends at Baden-Baden going to Eng- land, concluded to accompany them; leaving me free to accept a situation- which the ; .            "  * *- , I    P         , ,  ' '      ,o d I 166    'HDDEN TREASURE. friends of my mother's family had procured for me in Strasbourg. And here, I'should say, the adventures I promised to relate to you ,really begin. Thesituation mentioned was in the house- hold of a literary gentleman, the librarian of the celebrated Strasbourg Bibliotheque. The house in which he lived, and where I pres- ently took up my abode,: was one of those old mansions, Flemish in their architecture, , of which there are so many still remaining + in the ancient city of ,Strasbourg. The man- sion had been built by a wealthy burgher, in the latter part of the sixteenth century, and had afterward been sold to a French refugee-noble, of Huguenot principles, who had fled from his own country, and set up his household gods here, to escape the intolerance and tyranny of Cardinal Riche- lieu. It was a curious old house, with lofty step-gables fronting the street, and a turret  with loop-hole windows, projecting from an angle into: a court. *:  '     e  -'   i    ? '   1 HDDEN TREASURE.  ' 167 The old housekeeper, the learned chron- icier of the place, informed-me that the descendants of the nobleman I have men- tioned had come; to a tragic, end in the Revolution of 1789, the knife of the 'execu- tioner having cut off, with the head of the late proprietor, the 'Marquis de Chamilly, the last link of a noble line. Of course, there were strange stories about such a house, connected as it was with the' his- torv of an aristocratic fmily of the an- cient re'gime. I was told that the rambling old building was-haunted, and that, there were hidden treasures within 'its secret re- ce s, over which a goblin kept watchful guard; appearing, from time to 'time, in different forms, but changing at once into some familiar object if suddenly approached or accosted. , To' these stories the present' occupant, Dr. Von Schonberg, gave but little heed; classing them with thoce notable old wives' fables, the popular belief in which he de- ,*"' .    I68    HDDEN TREASURE, dared always to have been a specialty in these ghost-ridden provinces of the Rhine- land. But this philosophical scepticism of the learned librarian was by no means so firmly held by- his nephew Fritz, a student from Heidelberg, who frequently visited his uncle, and with whom, from the very begin- ning of our acquaintance, I had contracted a close friendship. At one of those confiden- tial exchanges of sentiment growing out of / this ,intimacy, Fritz informed me that lhe rather inclined to,the opinions of his uncle's housekeeper ;, who, by the way, had been an inmate of the mansion for nearly fifty years, and was firmly convinced, from:, personal observation, that the house was really haunted by what the Dutch call a "Spook" (the old lady was from Rotterdam)', and the Germans a "Poltergeist," or' racketing spectre. "You may have observed," said my newly-found friend, "that there is, in this i  "'    I           t   HDDEN TREASURE.     I69 old house, a singular portrait. -;The painting has a curious history, and is believed to be at the bottom of these mysterious sights and sounds.' You may smile at these no- tions, but I found, that,din Strasbourg, there were many, even  among the educated, who clung to such superstitions." There were, to be sure, some who rather affected this belief; for the legendary his- tory of the Rhineland was ,dear to them. Others, however--including many distin- guished names, not only in the Rhineland, but even in England---held to the doctrines of Mesmer, and; with more or less tenacity, to opinions not unlike those of Dr. Vo n Schonberg's venerable housekeeper. In- deed, there might be quoted, as on their side, Dr. Samuel Johnson, who" believed in the Cock-lane ghost story; John Wesley, who, in his journal, entered his solemn protest against those learned men who gave up the accounts of witches and apparitions as mere old. wives' fables; whilst in Scotland, their 8    170    HDDEN TREASURE. contemporaries, the divines of the Associated Presbytery passed a resolution declaring their belief in witchcraft, and deploring the general scepticism.  Even. Goethe" might be quoted, who testifies to an apparition witnessed by himself, when a resident of this same city of Strasbourg, which would compare in strangeness with the stories I heard about this old h6use of Dr. Von Schonberg.   i But, really, why should educated people of our time be so sceptical on such sub- jects, even of the very existence of those spiritual beings-good and  bad angels-in which our pious forefatheris believed, al- though, by degrees, their conceptions of them became debased by materialistic ideas? I refer particularly to those doctrines of the ;: . '-Cabalists, whose teachings on the subject of the spirits of nature--the enfbodiments or' i representatives of the four elemients-were  generally prevalent in the middle ,of -the * See "Autobiography,", book ii. vol. i.   HDDEN TREASURE.     17I rventeenth, or, I might say, even down to the beginning of the last century.  But, apart from such =corruption, which may be 'at the bottom of the scepticism of the present age, is it not the height of arro- gance for man to suppose that he is the only or highest intelligent creature in the universe; and but little short of atheism for  him to imagine that. there is nothing be- tween him and the Deity.? Indeed, it seems to me that the Platonic idea of a hierarchy of spirits, rising, by degrees, from man, even as man, the connecting linkl in creation rises from the lowest animate life, is a vast deal more rational than the Sadduceeism of our modern philosophy.  j Here my friend Nick rang for the claret, observing that his story was likely to be rather long, and, without a proper corrective,'  might also prove rather dry. As I was anxious to hear something more of the haunted, house, and of any strange adventures Nick himself might have met   172     HDDEN TREASURE. with while there, I urged him  to go on with , his story.  Mine host, the portly landlord of the Gate- house- Inn, now   entered with the dessert; which, with true publican politeness, he, with his own hands, placed upon the table., This ceremony having, been thus duly performed, my friend Nick   continued as follows.

I was seated 'before a' blazing fire of wood in the apartment wrhere' hung the imysterious picture, which, accord- ing to tracition, was so intimately connected with the history of the ancient family of the late Marquis de Chamilly. Whetler I was then in a sleepinrg or waking state I lave never yt been able satisfactorily to deter- . mine. The logs on the hearth burned clieer- ily, and the rays of the setting sun, streamin 0 through the traceried windows, filled thle quaintly-furnished room with a -mellow gol- den light, bringing out in bold relief the glossy red berries of the holly, branches of ,   HDDEN TREASURE.

The good librarian, who had some engage- ment abroad, on leaving the house had re- quested me to wait here for his return; for -it being a popular festival, the servants, ex- cepting the housekeeper, had obtained leave of absence. He hld made the request the. more palatable by adding to the substantial refection provided by his housekeeper- who did' not like to be left alone--a bottle of excellent Rhenish, as good as any poor scholar like myself could hope honestly to come by.  @ How long I waited on this occasion I can-  not, after so many years, recollect. I can only remember that the daylight. was grad- ually succeeded by the flickering light of the fire, which, to my excitable imagination, gave grotesque forms to many familiar ob- jects around me. Perhaps I felt the inspir- ing influence of the bottle of Steinberger, which, like the precious liquor possessed by                 ' , Qf  I    e P   j     I176    HDDEN TREASURE. Odin, may have had the power of transform- ;  innto poets those who drank it.  *At any rate, I was sitting in the chimney- corner, half reclining in a comfortable leather- bottomed easy-chair, silently contemplating the curious carving on the back of a similar convenience opposite me, and wondering at the portentous mitre that served as a finizd to the, high-backed arm-chair, and at the fire, which seemed animated, and, like myself, to be in a contemplative mood, for, soft and dreamy, it was speaking to itself in a purring, gentle tone, not unlike that of a miniature steamer blowing off steam preparatory to some excursion into Fairyland. As I have said, I do not know how long I remained in this comfortable position, for I took no particular note of time, being in a state of happy contentment and freedom from care. I  had just closed my eyes for a moment--perhaps that I might think the better-when I was surprised at hearing myself rather unceremoniously addressed.

The shadow of the tongs had grown i to something not unlike the figure of a giant; and the armor on the walls, which had done good service! in the time of Henri Quartre, wore a threatening aspect, as if the soul of some deceased warrior was glaring at me through the bars of his closedvisor, whilst the tattered banner above. the trophy seemed to wave inl the fitful light, as if swayed by some ghostly hand. It is just the time, thought I, for a ghostly  visitation. Although not superstitious, I do not care to be alone in a queer old house like this; for if there be any truth in old stories, this stately apartment is just the place that goblins would choose for their Christ- mas gambols.

But it must have been the fire, saidI aloud; thinking of the voice that had 'disturbed me.

T   CHAPTER IV.  "By which we rnote the Fairies Were of the old profession: Their dances were procession." PERCY'S  RELIQUES. TrIm origin of the care and solicitude which I, your patron saint, have ever felt for you and your family, you should know, is of, a very remote antiquity. In fact, it was in the twelfth century that an ancestor of the Duke of BUrgundy, founded his fortune  and that of your family, by knocking on t he head an assassin who wickedly made an at- tempt: on the life of the Duke, his master. It was at this holy season (on a Christ- mas-eve) that a caitiff, disguised as a jon"  gleur, who had pressed forward among the   HDDEN TREASURE. ,    185 guests and retainers present, sprang upon the Duke, and would have assassinated him, but, for the timely assistance of your an- cestor; who, according to an ancient cus- tom, was singingr a carol in the hall of the castle; attired in the Episcopal habit of a Boy- Bishop, to which office he had been elected by his fellow-choristers. ' , Your ancestor', my Worthy representative on that occasion, with a blow frorrt his official baton, or pastoral staff, laid the vil- lain lowr; and, by this fortunate stroke, or rather, I should say, stroke of fortune, raised himself from the humble station of choir-boy in the ducal chapel to that of' page of honor to his sovereign lord, the Duke -of Bur- gundy. Wealth rapidly followed on this promo- tion; and the gallant achievement was duly commemorated by! proper heraldic embla- zonment, on a shield which they have ever since -borne, i"De Gzles a la Fasce ' Or;"  which, with the surname Baton-afterward   I 886'v x HDDEN TREASURE.  corrupted into Bouton-was graciously be- stowed upon him by the Duke.  There, were, to be sure, in after times, envious persons about the court, who gave a different account of the origin of this sur- name; saying that he: bestowed upon his, favorite the name of Bouton, rather than Baton, in allusion to the brightness of the buttons with which, as page, his coat was profusely adorned'. However this may be- and-people were careless of orthography in those days-he Moon laid aside, the orna- mented coat of the page for the more manly habiliments of a full-grown man-at-arms. Acquiring fresh laurels in the wars of the period, he received from the Duke additional marks of favor ; the command of the fortress of Dole, with the hand of an heiress, whose broad lands and baronial castle enabled him now, as Seigneur De Fay, to rank among the proudest nobles of Burgundy. With all this prosperity, however, there was one thing wanting to complete his   HDDEN TREASURE  .  - IS7 earthly felicity, and that was the birth of a son and heir who might succeed him in his well-earned hdolors and estates.   , * In accordance with the custom of the age, vows and pilgrimages were made in I the hope of propitiating the saints? The Seineur and his Lady had even attempted to reach the Grande Chartreuse, that cele- brated sanctuary founded by St. Bruno, in the desert of Grenoble. ButatChamberry, whither they iHad journeyed, they found that the profane footsteps of woman had never yet been allowed to pollute a place conse-" crated by the Carthdsians to silence and meditation.  Your ancestor, therefore, always wise and prudent, left his wife and baggage at Cham- l brry, and visited alone the monastery of the Grande Chartreuse. *In 146I, the, Duke and Duchess of Norfolk, the last of the princely li of of Mowhray, made a similar pilgrimage on foot to 5Valsingham, to wish at the wishing well of that famous shrine, for an heir male.- "The Pilgrims of Walsingham."

Influenced by thc advice received at that sombre retreat, he determined to? make a pil- grimage, accompanied by his wife, to Bari, a city of the Adriatic, where the relics of Myra's canonized archbishop are enshrined -with great magnificence. "For," argued the reverend coadjutor, "if the good St. Nich- olas can bestow husbands on dames and damsels in want of them, why should not he, the patron saint of children, lend a favor- able ear to pious suppliants like yourselves? "Moreover, the monks of- Bari, unlike those of our poor house, receive distin- ,.guished pilgrims in a manner becoming their rank, for the Prior of St. Nicholas entertains noble knights and their beauteous dames with splendid hospitality." r:  .

I89 The tone of' this last recommendation (continued my humorous visitant, recovering ahis gravity) betokened something of an envious spirit, for the more severe ascetics, such as the Carthusians, are apt to be a little scandalized at the more worldly-milded compliances of their brethren of other orders.  The Seigneur and his Lady, therefore, extended their pilgrimage to Bari. You doubtless have heard of -the  great Church of St. Nicholas, with its subter- raneous chapel of rich Saracenic architect- ure, and of the healing water springing from- the rock iupon which the church is founded. Of that manna of St, Nicholas (as the water is called), your ancestors reverently partook, with clasped hands, wishing as they drank, for thus, as at Walsingham, did sup- pliants drink.       , They were at Bari at the Festa of St. Nicholas, and took part in ,tlhe peculiar pro-   Igo90    HDDEN TREASURE.  ceedings which, by land and sea,* distinguisl that popular anniversary. Refreshed in body and spirit, the Seigneur and his Lady turned their faces homeward taking with them   a plenteous supply of tle manna, or as some will have it, the manner of St. Nicholas.  They took care, however, *In the Eleventh Century, the merchants of Bari made an expedition to the coast of Lycia, and -plun- dered the Churcl of Myra of its highly prized relics 'of St Niclholas.

"Early in the morning," says the Book' of Days,  "they ienter the :Church in procession, and receive from .the Canons the wooden image of the Saint, attired in the robes and mitre of an archbishop, which they bear in triumph through the' city, attended by the Canons only so far as the outer archway'of the pre.-  cincts of the priory.

They then return, and disemlbark under the blaze of illuminati6n, bonfires, and fireworks, and the intonation, by thewhole heaving mass of the population, of a Gregorian Litany of St. Nicholas." Late in the night they return the image to the reverend I custody of the Canons.  - ,     .       19  v   - X ;*       ' '!by: HDDEN TREASURE.

I observed, also, in passing through the broad streets and picturesque squares of the city, -that country people in their holiday dress were flocking into the town, some of them to Church, others on business or pleasure intent; for the open-air booths, with their garlands,      HDDEN TREASURE.     2I   t and lamps, presented to the passers-by. a tempting variety of articles sucli as are in  demand at this season. The rather Oriental character of the scene, with the varied costume of the people, re- minded me of those descriptions we have of the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles; which joyous season corresponds, in so many re- spects, to our festival of Christmas. i I walked briskly toward the gates' of the town, enjoying these surroundings, and in- haling, with emotions of pleasure, the sharp frosty air. I had been invited to attend a Christmas-tree celebration in the suburbs, at the house of Madam Von :Waldeck, a cousin of my friend Fritz, to whom I was indebted for the invitation. It was expected that I' would assist at the musical entertainment provided for the occasion, by playing, the accompaniments for her daughter, Mademoi- selle, Nichola. I have not mentioned the young lady before, although Fritz and my- self often met her in our walks, and we had *  *   .         *  *   212    HDDEN' TREASURE. been frequently invited to visit at Madam Von Vialdeck's.  From a -boy, as perhaps you know, I was quite a proficient in-nmusic. My natural talent for improvisation I had ilmlproved by study; and I therefore fancied myself not an unwelconme guest at a 'house whlere music was a specialty; and that, too, independently of my connection with Fritz. In ispite, however, of this agreeable en- gage ent, and of the Christmas-tree ceebra-  } tions in joyful, progress around me, glimpses of which I caugllht from time to time through tuncurtained windows, my mind, constan'tly reverted to my late' fireside adventure.  Could,-the apparition of St. Nicholas be really a ghostly visitation; or was it but the. working. ofmy own imagination? Indeed, I must have been dreaming--possibly I may have incautiously taken a drop too much of friend's most excellent Steinberger-or ihie I may have been the victim of some well-contrived practical joke.   HDDEN TREASURE.     213  .  1 The pastoral staff -which St. Nicholas left behind in his hurry seems to favor this last supposition, although its' now transformed condition might be, to the superstitious, an: additional proof of its having come from fairyland. For before my voice 1had brolken the spell, it seemed to be a golden crosier, enamelled withl emeralds and rubies; but, on the sudden disappearance of the goblin, the emeralds and rubies turned into holly leaves and'berries, twined about a forked hazel-rod; and yet I had thoroughly examined every, nook and corner of the apartment, but noth- ing whatever could I find that would serve in the slightest degree as a clue to the mys- tery. I must confess that ih my childhood, influ- 'enced by favoring circumstances, I had im- -  bibed a 'decidedly superstitious belief in the reality of sprites and hobgoblins. Who knows but that I may possibly be a descend- ant of that very Seigneur de Fay, of whose singular history I have this night heard so   -  t            , ,.   . I   214    HDDEN TREASURE. O' much? And may not the apparition token some favorable 'hange in the fortuesf our family?             ; Our names, to be sure, are spel:dierent- ly, but that may be merely acciden:ial,for, as the goblin observed, orthography was a ,mat- ter of indifference among the high,-brn in days of yore. I now tried to recollect what my mother had told me about our ancestors; but, al- though she talked a great deal about the dig- nity of her own family, the Von Steinbacks,  she had very little to say on the subject of my paternal ancestry. Indeed, from the hints she threw; out, I inferred that there l'ight hbe the stain of illegitimacy on the birth of my father and uncle.. However, as I passed through the gates of the city, the calm serenity of the nmoonlight, : seen beyond the walls, diverted my thoughts 4 from these genealogical speculations, and brought to my mind the appropriate lines of Shakespeare,-           .  1.   - HDDEN TREASURE.     21 5 , And ten, they say, no spirit can walk about- The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,' No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm; So hallowed, and so gracious iS the time!"

The fact is, at tie recommendation, of my  friend Fritz, I had just been reading a variety  of erudite works-on the subject of fairyland;  among them a rare tract -of I635, entitled, A  Description of the King and Oueen of- the Fayri6;  theirF Jhabits, fare, abode, pomp, and state, being very delightful to the sense, and full of mirth." : These spiritual beings were sometimes called by the writers of that period Hobgob-  lins, or Robin Goodfellows; " a kind of spir- its," says one of these quaint old authors, '" more familiar and domestical than others; who, from some unknown cause, abide in one place more than another; so that some never --  .

Why may not .?uck have intended to point out to me the hidden treasures which the old bouse is bslieved to contain? I am sure the goblin was holding: it in his hand, and that he pointed with it to the old cabinet. I have been thus particular in recalling my thoughts on this occasionj because I was at one of those conjunctures in human affairs which, as you shall hear, exerted a powerful influence on my destiny.

The shock my nervous systejm had received made i my slumber that night feverish and uneasy. Fairy forms, about which I had been thinking so much, seemed to busy themselves around me; at first; one in Episcopal costume recited in an uncouth language sohnething that might have been a Christmas carol, varying the occupation, however, by preach- ing from the sill of a deeply-recessed window, extemporized for the nonce into a pulpit.

The mitre was well garnished with pearls and precious stones, whilst within "the crook of the golden pastoral staff held in his hand there was an image of St.'Nicholas.

The curiosity or the sympathetic feelings of the ladies being excited by this report, I was induced, notwithstanding the warning I had received from Dr. Von Schonberg as to the dainger of revealing the secrets of IFairy- land, to give them a full account of my  aChristmas-eve adventure.- Indeed, the solic- itude of Mademoiselle quite reconciled me to the situation, so that I began to think that ihe mishap, instead' of being a punishment for tale telli/zfg (although in my conversation with the doctoir I had but alluded to the vision) was one of t ose misfortunes which are in reality blessing in disguise. Both of them seemed highly interested in the marvel- lous story, and as they wtere the cousins of '   Dr. Von Schonberg, they promised to obtain for me access to the mysterious 9Idj cabinet.

The old Baron Von Katzellenbogen, who " assisted on the occasion as Pelsnichol, or "Nicholas with the Fur," seemed to me a much less interesting character; although his costume, I must adinit, was quite unexcep- tionable, :for he wore a long-furred pelisse trimmed with ivy leaves, with a green sash around his waistj and a bearskin cap on his head, and a huge pair of spectacles with red, ' glasses, symbolical, doubtless, of that couleur de rose medium through which everything should be seen at this season. The baron, oi"Old Cats,"' as Fritz and I sometimes irreverently called him, though, 'by the way, he was under forty, had made: himself particularly useful off' this occasion, having "a great, deal of ingenuity in small matters, and a decided taste for scenic rep- resentation. But perhaps you think that I was looking upon the lucky baron through spectacles of a greenish hue. However that may be, it was very clear that Mademoiselle would nota   'IDDEN T  AsUR.    227 look upon him at all; evidently to the an- ae  of het r acmamma, with whom the ma, riousoldwturehe learon'seemd to be in high favor.

The doors being at     I   ength opened, we found no treasure of gold and precious stones, as some of us perhaps expected, but a collection of printed books and manuscripts onthe now almost forgotten. subiects Of alchemy and astrology. .Among these were the Works of Albertus Magnu  s, Roger Bachn, ad a lsus, There, we)o- and Paracelsu. hr ee   228    HDDEN TREASURE. glyphical writings of certain ,Rosicrucian   philosophers. Of the more modern printed books was the curious work of Dr. Price published as late as I782.  I Dr. Von Schonberg, surprised at the dis-  covery, said he now recollected hearing that 1 the former proprietor ,of the mansion, the Marquis de Chamilly, had a taste 'for these occult studies. Indeed, he was suspected of being little better than a magician, or a white1 :witch at the least. Among those present at this discovery was my friend Fritz, who was again'on a visit to his uncle, having arrived unexpectedly on the very night of my mis- hap. Fritz seemed to: take the liveliest in- terest in the proceedings, and called our at- tention to the armis ,emblazonedon some of the volumes, De Gzlesa a Fasce d'Or, which- were those of tie Marquis de C amilly. We observed that the same heraldic device was also carved on the ,old cabinet, as well as  emblazoned on the cushioned back of an arm- chllair,--the same the goblin had o ccupied. , *         .        .

Who knows," continued he, "( but that the study of  these learned works may lead you to some important 'discovery, if not ,too that' still cherished, but as yet unrealized, dream of alchemy,-the philosopher's stone.

"As for the kindred science of astrology, the parent of astronomy, even the scep- tically-inclined Favorinus tells us that all human events are influenced by the stars; which many wise men, both before and since his time,have believed. For, be- sides Zoroaster, and other uninspired author- ities, there are the prophet Balaam, iand the star-led kings, whose bones are so magnifi- cently enshrined in our famous city 'of Co- logne." Although this was said between jest and, i earnest, the interest my fair friends seemed to take in the discovery, and rny own anti- quarian- proclivities, determined me to inves- tigate, at my leisure, the curious old books which fortune had thus throwh in my way.

Moreover, Fritz told me that his father had- with eighteen others, all of them   persons of distin'ction--been present at the raising of the ghost of the Chevalier de Saxe, at Dresden, in the palace of Prince Charles of Saxony,--an astonishing event, creating at that, time a great sensation among the select few who were cognizant of the * Wraxall, in 7 7 7, says that "The Germans, almost 6   . universally,] even those of the soundest and most cul- tivated undlerstandings, believe in the, existence of familiar spirits; in whose train follow witches; ghosts, and the whole family of invisible agents; " and that "IPrinces, Ministers, and General Officers. of dis-  tingplished reputations are not ashamed ' to be initiated into magical mysteries, and to be present at " nocturnal meetings for the purpose of evoking or raising appari- , tions."'

The Prince's ourage failed him, however, on the appear- ance of the ghost, for instead of demanding of the spectre the whereabouts of the treas- ure, he fell on his knees and prayed God for mercy, whilst the rest of the company earn- estly besought Schrepfer to rid them of the fearful apparition. Fritz, the child, of his father's old age, came thus, as you will perceive, by a sort of natural inheritance, to a very respectable amount of legendary lore. As I said, we had gone out for our afternoon's walk, which was' usually in that part of te ton. most frequented by the ladies; but on this, cca- sion, as Fritz was to tell me a story; we   234     HDDEN TREASURE. sought out some   more  quiet place, and turned our footsteps, therefore, toward the old cathedral,---the open doors; of' which seeme'd silently inviting us to enter.. Here, as we paced up and down the    shadowy 'aisles, surrounded by memorials of the past, Fqritz related to me the promised legend. I did not interrupt the narrative or mani- fest any incredulity, for I had heard that- he had  once- challenged a fellow-student :,who. had ventured to question the authen- ticity of a certain tradition of his own family, which assigns to the work of enchantment the rocks in the Rhine beneath Schonberg Castle,* known as the Seven Sisters. * In this Castle of Schonberg (beautiful, hilD, says Victor Hugo, "dwelt, in the Tenth Century, the seven- cruel and scoffing young ladies, who may now 9 be admired through the fissures of their castle, trans- formed into seven rocks in the Rhine."

The -       -. ,  , wrarder would have rudely driven the appli- cant from the. walls, had not the seneschal, who was passing at the time, ordered instant admission, saying that on such a holy night, any one in need of hospitality should be wel- come, however unreasonable the hour. The traveller was a middle-aoed .man, who, from his singular dress and imperfect. knowledge of the language, appeared to be - a foreigner, Everythingibf value about his person seemed to- be contained in a knap- sack, strapped to his shoulders, concerningr which he was very solicitous. The senes- chal observed this, and being a good-natured man, he assigned to, his exclusive use a ' small chamber, in a turret projecting from an, angle of the fortress. It was an eventful night at Dole, for be- sides its being Christmas-eve, it was also made memorable by the good lady of the 4*'           i   HDDEN TREASURE.     2 ?

As the horoscope was highly satisfactory to the parents, promising an illustrious career to the young baron, the stranger- career to the young who, the seigneur now found, was a scholar from the University of Prague, in. Bohemia, --was made more welcome than ever; and the turret-chamber, which had proved so convenient an observator-, was given up to his permanent and undisputed possession. Here; for many years, he continued to re side. He was often visited by the Seigneur de Fay, who held long and mysterious con- versations with him, not only on astrology, but also on the kindred subject of alchemy, bt aso ,on   238    HDDEN TREASURE.  in which occult science the philosopher, or Father Nicholas, as he called himself, was found to be an adept  The clergy, and other good people about the town, shook their heads and shrugged their shoulders at this growing intimacy. Moreover, strange stories were whispered ' regarding the nature of these secret confer- ences, and of the bright lights and explosive V -sounds which' were frequently seen andc i heard in the lonely turret-chamber, ,now con-\ verted into a laboratory. As years rolled on, 'it was observed that the philosopher, who still tarried at. Dole, was less and less frequent in his attendance at church (for the alchemists and astrologers of those days were usually very devout;' or, at least, made great religious professions, otherwise it would have ibeen difficult for them to have escaped the charge of sorcery).

Before going, however, he completed an im- portant work on which hue had been for some time engaged, and that- was a picture, for it seems he was an artist as well as an alchem- ist; the knowledge acquired in the one art being skilfully applied to the other. The :painting was a portrait of the son and heir, now a well-grown youth. The sittings, like the studies of the adept, were conducted with secrecy. It leaked 'out, however, that the colors used were .such as had never befo're been seen on the palette of any mere mortal.

Behind -him, as he rode forth, ' . . , * ' , . * '   r  te  ,o  . I   HDDEN TREASURE.     - 243, was the fortress, andbefore him a rising thunder-cloud. As he rea'ched an eminence, at some distance from tile walls 1;of the town, the warder from his tower saw ihim expand into something like gigantic proportions, and merge into the advancing cloud, which at the same moment gave forth a blinding flash, followed by a crashing peal of thunder; whilst the rising thunder-grust sweeping over the fortress, carried with it the-turret occu- pied for so many years by the magician! It is also said by the same indisputable authority, that no mason could ever be found willing to undertake the rebuilding of the turret, so strongly were the people per- suaded that it had been kicked -over by the devil incarnate, when, on that evening, the magician, mounted on his black charger, rode, as it were,_on the whirlwind, over the fortress of Dole. Even to this day the in- dentation of a horse's hoof, on a fragment of the battlements, is shown as'unquestionable     244    HDDEN TREASURE. proof of the authenticity of this marvellous story; for the horse-shoe, you know, is said to be the mystic symbol of the wizard-foot. This portentous -eave-taking, .you may be sure, so loosened the tongues of the gos- sips of the neighlborhood, that even the fear of offending the seneschal could not sup- press their, murmurs of indignation. In- deed, [the seneschal himself only, escaped the charge of sorcery and complicity with the wizard by pious donations, especially to the monks dwelling in a Franciscan convent hard By. Among other things now brought against the,late occupant of the shattered turret was that of being a oIpup-garou, or wer-wolf; and ' it was said that credible witnesses were ready to testify that he had, at divers times, kidnapped and devoured sundry missing children of: the peasantry, Indeed, many, years after, when 'most of, those directly cognizant of these events had passed away, a man, who answered to the  \   ,   HDDEN TREASURE.     245 name of Gillies Gamier, was actually indicted at Dole for being a loup-garou, and for prowl ing, in the shape of a wolf, about the country at night. Fifty witnesses testified against him  ; and being put to the rack, he himself confessed the truth of the charge. Among those present at theexecution- for he was burned alive, and his ashes scat- tered to the wind *-were some- old men who recollected the mysterious circumstances at- tending the allhemist's departure from the castle f6Ole. It was the opinion of these venerable worthies that Gillies Garnier-the loup-garou--and the alchemist were one and the same person, and that under different forms, he, had been all these many years prowling about in the neighborincg forest, devouring, dragon-like, children and forlorn maidens.

There were those who said that he had taken sanctuary, as it were, lest the sorcerer, ,mounted on the black horse, should come -after him, some day, to claim llim as his own, Iin fulfilment of the conditions of a certain bond which he or his father had, in an incau- tious moment, been ,-e'rsuaded to sign.

Be this as it may, the mysterious picture, down to the time of the French Revolution, was guarded by the family with the utmost reverence and care, being brought with them to Strasbourg in the time of Cardinal Riche- I lieu.

In fact, it seems to have been some- thing; like the brazen head made by Rotger Bacon, which was so magically constructed that it could-speak and prophesy. The en- f   .chanted picture, hlowever, seems to have excelled even this prodigy of hermetic art, If or the brazen head could only talk, but the imagical picture not only talked, but walked; which, on divers occasions, even in' modern times, it is said to have done, much to the terror of the select few who have been per- mnitted to witness its supernatural perform- ances.

THE ALCHEMST. WITH such assistance as I could obtain from my friend Fritz, accomplished in such matters, I now devoted myself to the study of the old books you have mentioned, the greater part of my time being, in fact, spent in learned researches, and in experiments founded upon them. It has been said that no one in the nine- teenth century could become an alchemist, unless he studied only the hermetical writ- ings of past ages, and shut both eyes and ears to all the facts -of modern chemistry. But this is exactly what we did, for none   254 1   HbDEN-TREASURE.-. but old authors were of any account with us. And yet a subject: to which Newton could " devote some of the best years of his life could scarcely be, called absurd, and it is not known that he ever abandoned the study of alchemy. Even in our time, so eminent a chemist as Sir Humphrey Davy has admitted the possibility of the, transmutation of metals, although, in his opinion, thex process might prove unprofitable. As my much-respected patron was most,  of the time from home, Fritz and I had the old house pretty much to ourselves. The turret-chambers, over that communicating with the room in which was the mysterious picture and cabinet, had bee} used by the late Marquis de Chamilly as an observatory and laboratory, for he had been an adept in his younger days, devoting himself to both alchemy and astrology, and had predicted by astrological art -those excesses which, in the French Revolution, proved so fatal to himself and fanily.  , 1    ,  '*   HDDEN TPIEASURE.

Moreover, Fritz introduced me to the study of the then .mucl talked of science of animal magnetism, being-, in fact, himself one of the contributors to the Anz- nzles de ffa Mo'netisnme Animal, a journal then jtlst established, and devoted exclusively to this subject. Our inyestigations in this direction led ustto the belief that this new science was in reality an old system under a new name; in a word, the Rosicrucian philosophy, and that Mesmer himself was but the latest exponent of a phi- losophy which, under different names and in different countries, has, existed from the ear- liest times.           ;  Fritz told me that the late Marquis de Chamilly' had been also a believer in th}e science, and that' le had workled many won- derful cures, especially among the peas- antry upon his estate, chiefly by means of a marvellous oak tree, which he had mag- netized, around which his patients would sit   257 HDDEN TREASURE.  from morning till night, breathing the health fuul breezes that swept over the park, and in- vigorated by the magnetic fluid which issued from the balsamic branches of the tree.

In fact, I must have been one -of those persons Who, from causes never yet explained, become electrical, and, while in that state, exercise a remarkable influence on objects around them, causing them to tip up and roll about, and even giving slocls to people by mere force of will. - The mysterious picture frequently gave signs of uneasiness, rattling as if the fiure of the. masquerading baron was about to leap down from his panel the doors of the old cabinet. also we're moved' and banged "about, and the drawers were shaken with violence, as if ghostly fingers were attempt- iny to pull them out!   258,     HDDEN TREASURE.       -   ' My friend Fritz, who was much with me about this time, insisted upon it that these      I were   spiritual manifestations.

But, alas! in escaping from the strale  sights and sounds o-f the old house, I soon  found I was running into other entangle- ments. They were, to be sure, of a very . different nature from the weird and spectral phantasmagoria experienced in tli venerable mansion. In shor, I discovered, as you may have already guessed, that the pleasing spell Mademoiselle exercised over my susceptible imagination was becoming a more potent "M      o    HDDEN TREASURE.     2i      ; species of enchantment than any connected with either the magical picture or the mys- terious old cabinet. I now recall, with feel- ings of mingled pleasure and 'regret, those days of. romantic interest, when I -hoped for -for I know not what. But to hasten on with my story,  In the summer and autumn of that year, , I, was frequently invited to take part in  rural excursions of pleasure, that 'had for their object a visit to some one or other of the ..numerous public or private gardensf surrounding the city. On these occasions, wher I was so fortunate as to find myself alone with Mademoiselle (which, truth to tell, was much oftenqe   an her mamma would have quite approv,  I- would speak of my mysterious studies, and their strange conse- quences, as we walked together beneath the shadow of those stately groves which form' so pleasing a feature of the landscape around Strasbourg. Now, I do not mean to say that I, a mere  262    HDDEN TREASURE,  adventurer, ;as it were, took advantage of these confidential tete-a-tetes to make lovI to this beautiful, accomrplished, ahld high-bori demoiselle. Oh, no! 'her station'put suct presumption altogether out of the question. She might, to be sure like- a superior being, be worshipped by even a poor student with  such devotion as, in days of yore, a "squire of low degree," paid to the daughter of the* King of Hungary, b-ut withiout the hope of any such reward as befel that squire of Dames. Mademoiselle was not surprised at, the accounts I gave of spiritual manifestations, observing -that she had always heard. that the old house was haunted by a racketing spectre; being convent'bred, she had an acquired,-as well as a natural, turn for the imarvellous.

My uncle, I am sure, will - give me that advice of which I stand so much in need, for I am afraid that; instead of be- coming a philosopher, I am getting to be a mere visionary, and a dreamer of dreams. *},  \       - mer .    i        ,  ,       ' {3 f f}   ' *  \    * CHAPTER X. , "Learning here puts on all its majesty.

"And," continued he, "'hould you consider yourself properly qtalified for Holy Orders, there are two valuable livings in my gift,-the next presentation to Which, the incumbents being both old, shall be at your service."  My uncle partich:arly recommended the,   HDDEN TREASURE.     265 University of Cambridge, the mathematical course of which he thought best suited to my mental requirements. "For," said he, look- ' ingr as if he might have heard something of my adventures in Fairyland, "the study of the exact sciences is the best corrective for the fanciful vagaries of youth," In accordance, therefore, with this very "- liberal proposition, I found myself, after requisite preparation, regularly entered a 'student of St. John's College; Cambridge. The, severity of my mathematical studies did not, however, obliterate recollections of S,trasbourg* and its charming inhabitants. During the winter months, to be sure, I ap- plied myself diligently enough; but with the apptoach of the merry month of May, and as. the spring was melting into summer, I tired of my books, and sighed for green fields; and, with Old Herrick for a companion, went loiter- ing about through rural scenes, dreaming "Of brooks, of blossoms, birds, and bowers; Of April, May; of June and July flowers; r 2 [    266    HDDEN TREASURE.  Of May-poles, hock-carts, wassail, wakes; Of bridegrooms, brides, and of their bridal cakes."  Indeed, my enthusiasm   for the quaint sports and pastimes described by Old Her- rick was so great, that I made an excursion into Herefordshire, expressly to witness the rustic merry-making at a Whitsun-ale, and the performance of a Morris-dance, round a genuine May-pole, by'a band of, octogena- rians; the legitimate descendants of a long line of merry-makers, reaching back to Mor- ris-dancing contemporaries of Shakespeare, and the old time- before them. The festival  took place on a smoothly-shorn lawn, spread- ing from an old manor-house to an equally old barn, of huge dimensions, that had been decorated for the occasion by the peasantry.  I Here the -"-Lord and Lady of the Ale" en- tertained their rustic followers. The, open I timber roof, and raised floor, at the upper end, seemed to give the lId barn somewhat the semblance of an ancient baronial hall. But, besides these distant -objects of romantic   HDDEN TREASURE.     267 interest, I found, nearer home, others of a more refined and quiet nature. , Clare-hall Walk, my favorite resort, is'one of those deliciously picturesque lounges, dear, to the soul of dreamers like myself. If you have not yet seen Cambridge, visit it at this genial season. For at midsummer the lime trees are in bloom', and everything about the university and the grounds is in perfection.

And let it be at the hour of even-song, when tower and pinnacle are gilded with the rays of the setting sun; when the midsummer twilight is gradually fading into the silence of night, broklen only by -the chimes of St. Mary's, as, with enchanting . sweetness, their silvery tones from time to time steal upon the ear. Here, loitering on the banlks of the river in pen- sive meditation, I have inwardly rejoiced in    2(58    HDDEN TREASURE. the repose and calm quiet of the scene; en- hanced by theoccasional appearance of phan- tom-like; boats, which, noiselessly propelled --like the even course of a good man's life- glide by on the peaceful waters of the Cam, disappearing under some one of the pictur- esque stone bridges' that span, the stream. It was at such a time, when returning fromt even-song at King's College chapel, where I had lingered with a college friend, listening with awe to the distant choral service, as it rose from   unseen choristers beyond the screen of the ante-chapel,whose voices were swelling. and dying away' amid the ,echoes that haunt its reverberating aisles, and re- peating to myself those lines of Words- worth,-- "Tax not the royal saint with vain expense, With ill-matched aims the architect who planned, ' Albeit laboring for a scanty band Of white-ro}ed scholars only, this immense And glorious work of fine intelligence! 4 -...

At this point, Nick seemed to become somewhat incoherent, or it may be I myself wais beginning to doze a little, feeling, per- haps, the drowsy influence of the hour, and the moralizing turn the story was taking,- to say nothing of the claret we had imbibed!

He had, when young, mar- ried the daughter of a woollen manufacturer 'of Leeds, with whom he was associated in business. Inidue time hIis wife succeeded to the handsome fortune bequeathed to her by her father, which fortun'e had-been largely augmented by the recent discovery of coal and iron ore on the lands which she had. inherited. My uncle's family consisted of a wife and son-an invalid-and a .grand- daughter, a young lady of eighteen, who had just made her debgut in society. It was, therefore, with feelings of consid-  erable elation and' pride that I set out on a visit to these rich English relations of mine. It was, I recollect, a-clear, frosty afternoon -the 24th December, IS7- that I found myself on an English stage-coach, driving  into the thriving town of Wakefield. 'At    , the York and Lancaster Inn, where the   280    HDDEN TREASURE. mail coach drew up, a servant, in the livery of my uncle, was oil the lookout for me. I was informed by the footman, that his younII mnistress--my uncle's granddaughter-was waiting for me at the vicarage; and that she herself proposed to drive us over in her pony-phaeton to the manor, about two miles distant. The vicarage was a picturesque,e looking, old hous, standing back from the street, covered witl ivy, and surrounded by gardens. It was but a short distance from '0 the parish church; a building remarkable for its spire, the loftiest ih Yorkshire,a county celebrated for the magnificence of its min- sters and churches. I took particular note of the surroundings, for the living was one of those in the gift of my uncle, the reversion of which had been offered to me. Perhaps, said I to myself, one day or other I may be the successor of the famous Dr. Primrose in this Vicarage of Wakefield, I wondered whlo would be the vicaress, and  ' whether I should succeed to the learned Doc- 1    HDDEN TREASURE.    28I tor's, opinions on the subject of monogamy; and also whether my journeys in the future would be like those peaceful migrations -of his\" from the blue bedroom to the brown." Rousing myself from such fanciful spec- ulations, I gave orders for the forwarding of my luggage, and followed the footman to the vicarage, where I found'my cousin, Miss Marian,.wh9 graciously informed me that she had been deputed to do the honors of the place, her grandfather not being expected home until the evening. Perfectly satisfied with .this arrangement, I took my place in the carriage beside the fair young chariote r, who handled the ribbons with so much grace and skill as to put me, in a momf^, quite at my ease. Our road, lay along the banks of the Calder, upon wlhich the town is situated. As, we crossed Wakefield Bridge, with its nine arches, she called my attention to a highly-decorated little chapel, which seemed - to form part of the structure, being built out on a small island, upon which oneiof the   282    HDDEN TREASURE.,  piers'"ested. Here it was, she said, that the i young Earl of Rutland, in the time of Henry. VI., was slain by the Lord Clifford, sur- named the Blackface, or Butcher. A little farther on was the farm-house where, tradi- tion says, he died. This chapel had been originally built by Edward III., and after- ward rebuilt by Edward IV., il memory of his father, the Duke of York, also slain at the same memorable battle of Wakefield. Slhe also told me that this famous, battle, im- H morta ized by Shalespeare, was fought on the green in front of Sandal's Castle, thet ruins of which we were then passing. The castle, with its walls and towers, had been demolished in the seventeenth century, by  order of the long parliament. The manor- : house of my uncle lay but a short distance ! beyond the ruins of the fortress. It was built in the time of Henry VIII., and being for state rather than defence, had escaped the fury of those unsettled times. ;The court within forms an irregular quadrangle.- Op-   ' HDDEN TREASURE.    283 posite the arched gate-house, or barbican, by which we had entered, 'and which, with its flanking turrets, was kept in a good state of preservation, there was a range of buildings, of about two hundred feet in extent, with a picturesque array of gables and projecting windows. As it w ould be some time before my un- cle's return, Marian proposed to show me the house, which had been considerably mod- ernized, but which still presented, in its rich- ly-carved'wainscoting and quaint old furni- ture, enough to make it interesting to one like myself, a devout admirer of the olden time. My archaeological curiosity having been at length, after no little dalliance, sat- isfied, I seated myself beside my cousin in the, darkly--wainscoted' library, the glossy panels of xxlhich were illuminated by the rays of the setting sun, streaming through the richly-stained glass' of its traceriesd win- dows. My fair cicerone now proceeded to ex-   284    HDDEN TREASURE. plain to me the programme for the holidays, , which it appeared included, among other festivities, private theatricals, of a tragicjas well as burlesque- character. Among the plays that had been selected for performance, was that of Henry VI., the third part of which had been arranged with a view to representation, obviously on ac- *count of its associations with the place. For the army of the Duke of York was defeated by t ae forces of Quleen Margaret on the green sloping froin the- neirghboring castle to the river. - It appeared, also, tlat I was expected to be one of the players, and as there was to be a preliminary rehearsal that very eveni ng, I was exhorted to devote ai! lhour or two  before dinner to the 'stud y of the part se- lected for me; which, I was tragi-comically informed, was to beothat of the black-faced Clifford. Of course, under sucll circunm- stances, to hear was to obey, and thus pro- vided with employment, I devoted myself,   t a   b  - , , * '   * .- HDDEN TREASURE.     285 withl considerable assiduity, to the study of'  my part; my thoug!hts, however, occasion- ally reverting t-o the character and position of my' cousi n.  Marian was, as any one could' easily per- ceive, the complete mistress of my uncle's establishment; for iler grandmother-a very meeklqquiet woman-exercised, apparently, but a nominal supremacy. Marian's mother having died "When she '-"was very young, she was naturall much petted, not to say   . spoiled, -her randparents humoring her in every whim and caprice. Sle was, I may say, decidedly handsome, and accomplished, too, after a fashion ,of her own. She had, indeed, little taste for those ordinary femi- nine accomplishments,-embroidery, music, and drawing; but then she could "sit a' horse" like Die Vernon,-clearing her five- barred gate at a fox-hunt; and she could snuff a candle with a pistol without'winking, at twelve paces. Being, moreover, an heiress, with great expectations, her singularity was   286    HDDEN TREASURE. applauded, and considered an evidence of genius and spirit. There were, of course, many admirers; among them, a half-pay colonel, a frequent visitor at Furnival Hall, a neighboringo country seat, the' property of his cousin, Sir Gerard Furnival. The at- tentions of this military gentleman, I imag- ined from .wlhat I heard, were much more agreeable to the young lady than to her grandfather; for it was said that the Colonel had rapidly run through one fortune, and it  was believed 'he was quite ready to try his hand at another. At length, aroused from this reverie by the sound-of merriment, I ventured out of the stillness and quiet of the library into the hall. Here the yule-log had just been lighted, which, with, the fagots surrounding it, was- sending up the capacious chimney a brilliant shower of sparks.' I found, as I entered, tWat s5ome of the household, unaware of the proximity of a stranger, were engaged in a sort of romping rehearsal of certain mum-   2'87 HDDEN TREASURE.            , neries that were to form a part of the even- g's entertainment. Presently the footman, e same I had founl waiting at Wakefield,  nformed me that a fire had been  lightedin ny room, and t!hat dinner would be served soon after the arrival of his master. Taking the hint, I followed him to my apartment, leaving the rest of them to their merriment.           tw     i CHAPTER   XIII. "Whence his name And lineage long, it' suits me not to say; Suffice it that, perchance they were of fame, And had been glorious in' another day." ' BYRON. MY uncle and I were seated at table after dinner, cracking nuts and sipping our wine. The other gentlemen of our party had one by one left us to join the 'ladies, who, with their chosen, lord of misrule, were engaged in the drawing-room in some secret consul- tation,-in which I was not invited to partici- pate. Not at all put out by this arrangement, which a more 'sensitive person mighlt have construed into a slight, I availed myself of a long-sought opportunity to ask  my uncle 'some questions in regard to the history of our family.        ; -  -    HDDEN TREASURE.     289- I had hitherto, from motives of delicacy, refrained from the inquiry, trusting that he would, of his own accord, give me the de- sired 'informationo.  Now, however, full of the good cheer of Christmas, and emboldened by the warm reception I had met with, I ventured to ap- proach the subject. ( Your father and I," replied he, in a confi- dential tone, not loud enough to disturb the after-dinner nap of' the only other remaining guest, who, reposing in a capacious arm- ciair, was comfortably dozing by the fire- side; "your father and I were, as you may have heard, twin brothers, and were brought up by a clergyman in the north'of Ireland, who gave us a good English education, such as was thought sufficient for those destined, like ourselves, for commercial pursuits. "'Our reverend preceptor was very reti- centon the subject of our birth. I recollect, however, that a gentleman of distinguished appearance called to see us from 'time to 13       -  *         * , ,   290;    HDDEN TREASURE. time, who seemed to take a particular inter- est in the progress we were making. This gentleman, I have since learned, was a French nobleman--the Marquis de Chamilly y --a frequent visitor at Ballyracket, an estate in the neighboring county belonging to a    ' cousin of his.  "This cousin- Hfrard Bouton-belonged to a younger branch of the Chamilly family, being a descendant of a brother of the great marquis, who, in the reign of Louis XIV.,  rose to the rank  of Marshal of France.'  Notwithstanding  this high relationship, he ' had, upon the revocation of the Edict of  i Nantes, emigrated to Ireland, following the-  fortunes of Marshal Schomberg, with whom   I he had served                 i I "D- istinguishing himself in the army of William III., he was, after the Battle of the Boyne, rewarded for his services by that monarch 'of Ppious, glorious, and immortal  memory,' with a  share of those confiscated lands that "had fallen to the conqueror.   HDDEN TREASURE. -291  "In consequence of political differences,, there had been but very little intercourse between the Irish and French branches of the family. ;  About the middle 'of the last century, however, a more friendly feeling- had been revived.  The late marquis, then a gay young man, renewed the 'intercourse by ac- cepting an invitation to visit his cousin in Ireland. "There he became enamoured of a beauti- ful girl of humble parentage. The generally received opinion was that your father and myself were the illegitimate offspring of this unfortunate attachment, although there were those who maintained that there had been a secret marriage, the evidence of which, for family reasons, had been most carefully sup- pressed. "The fact that the young marquis sub- sequently married a French lady of rank, strengthened the more common supposition, for it was thought incredible that a man of   292    HDDEN TREASURE., his rank and wealth could be guilty of so great a crime as that of bigamy."' I was, you may imagine, much surprised at this .mention of the Marquis de Chamilly. It at once brought: to my mind the myste- : rious picture, and the rummaging and rack- eting about the old house in Strasbourg. I now, with some hesitation, for I feared ridi-  - cule, gave my uncle a brief account of my ad- ventures in that goblin-haunted mansion, not forgetting the homily preached by the good St. Nicholas, on that memorable Christmas- eve. I mentioned, also, some curious docu- ments I had found, for you must know, be- fore leavirg Strasbourg, I had, at the sug- gestion of my fair friend, Mademoiselle, made a thorough investigation of the, old 'cabinet, where, at length, I discovered, in a  secret drawer, among other interesting pa- pers, a letter in cipher, which, from corrobo- -rating circumstances, judged to be from the late marquis to his friend Oberlin, at the time librarian of Strasbourg.   /i   I    HDDEN TREASURE.  -  293 "Could this be deciphered," said I, "it J might prove to be of the greatest value in clearing up the mystery that ,hangs over, the history of our family."   '*  Just at this moment a clamor in, the court- , yard before the manor-house interrupted our genealogical discussion. We rushed to the window, and discovered that the stirring event which was calling the, household together, was nothing less than the arrival of Old Father Christmas in per- . . son, who, suitably attended, his drum beaten; .  before him, surrounded by guards and torch-  ? bearers, in quaint costume, was making his . solemn entry through the arched gateway     l info the court-yard, which, illuminated by the i ruddy glare of the torches, presented a lively i picture of Christmas as it was in the olden   X time,.    CHAPTER XIV.

JOINING the ladies, we hastened to the hal!, where we witnessed one; of fhose curious Christmas Pageants, once so common in old English country houses, but such as are rarely to be   Seen in these days, except in some   old-fashioned manor-house like that of my   uncle.  My Cousin, who, as I   have said, exercised supreme   authority at home, had determined, on this occasion, to observe the Christmas   HDDEN TREASURE.  -   295 holidays "as in the olden tim e., Indeed, * the venerable mansion it which we were    , assembled was so suggestive of the man- ners and customs of days of yore, that a' young girl of her spirit could hardly help yielding to the impulse. The sports and  pastimes of the season, I soon found, were to go forward under a regularly constituted lord of mislrule.                I Sir Gerard de Furnival, the elderly gen- tleman I have mentioned, who kept bache; lor's hall in the neighborhood, had consented --perhaps in the interest of his cousin, the colonel-to humor our young hostess by officiating in that capacity. As it was Christ-  mas-eve, the lofty Gothic hall, with its an- cient armor aqd banners, was appropriately decorated with evergreens; the mystic mis- tletoe* appearing among them, suspended from a pendant in the richly-timbered roof. *This is the most indispensable of the Christmas evergreens, for "it brings the mirth." It has even become an article of commerce, Hertfordshire aloney' exporting annually above one hundred tons.   296     HDDEN TREASURE. The yule-log was brightly blazing on the wide  hearth, as the mummers from the court-yard entered the folding doors of the carved oaken;  screen, which, at the lower end of the hall, supported the music gallery. The screen, with its polished panels, was continued all round the hall, beneath the portraits and armorial decorations that covered the walls. Preceded by his motley attendants, Old/  Father Christmas greeted the company at his entrance, after a preliminary flourish by the minstrels, in the gallery above, with the fol-, ! lowing yule song: ' "Go on,-prepare my bounty for my friends,1  And see that mirth, with all her crew, attends! 1 Behold a personage well known to fame,      Once loved and honor'd,-Christmas is my name!

'There was the same ecclesiastical robe, jewelled mitre, and pas- toral staff; but instead of the smooth, boyish face that distinguished the magical picture, whichi on that occasion, descended -from the chimney-piece, I now, by the bright light il- luminating the hall,- beheld the familiar feat- ures of my friend Fritz, which I recognized in spite of the long white  beard he had assumed -for the occasion.

Hearing of the  sport and pastimes in preparation, he had proposed, with my uncle's consent and prom- ise of secrecy, to take me thus by surprise. The wassail-bowl, borne by one of his.  attendants, now went round. ,This symbol of good-fellowship-was in the formn of a capa- cious tankard, a ZIzibert czp, as it was called,  upon which the silversmith of the sixteenth century had exhausted his art. There were niches in the front aqd handle containing -  figures of huntsmen in bold relief, armed. with the implements, of their craft; and on each side were suspended representations of dead game,--the buck and wild boar; whilst X upon the cover a stag-hound reposed on a bed of oak-leaves and acorns.  t%         3    '  X   HDDEN TREASURE.    299i In days of yore this antique poc.ulum had served, as a loving cup to the good monks of Bolton, having been bequeathed to them by a sporting baron of the neighborhood; ,and on high- festivals, such as Christmas, it had gone round the refectory, charged with spiced ale and good wishes. Among the followers of Father Christmas was a company of players from Wakefield, -doubtless the legitimate descendants of the Christmas ludi, who, in the fifteenth century, figured in the mystery and miracle-plays for which that town was once famous. The bur- lesque play performed by them, soon after the wassail-bowl had gone round, was the traditional mock-play of St. George and the Dragon. The costume of the dragon was unexceptionally- correct; this green- winged, fire-spitting monster added not a little to the merriment of the scene by the manner in which he involved the unwary bystanders in the. scaly tangles of his tail. The mock-play, or morisco, was followed   l - 300    HDDEN TREASURE.  , M.    \ .  :  ,      . ' by the country-dance of Sir Roger de Coverley ded off by, my uncle and a portly dame, the wife of a neighboring country squire). , I observed, by the way, that the pretty housemaids in their finest ribbons, and the tall footmen with unexceptionable calves, were not excluded from this patriarchal fes- tival; and that the stout butler, in his scar- let inexpressibles, figured down the middle with much dignity, hand in hand with the venerable housekeeper.      '  Meanwhile, the mistletoe was gradually stripped of its white berries, one of which had been plucked every time any of the fair sex happenedath its seduc- 'tive branches; their reluctance to submit to submit to- the penalty of a kiss, it must be confessed, seemed to me more affected than real; in- deed, what was the harm?"for Christmas comes but once a year." After the hilarious uproar had subsided (the domestics having carried off the players      .              .

The old gentleman occasionally refreshed his mem- ory by reference to a manuscript entitled ( Chronicles of Lawford Hall." I obtained a copy of it, which, some day or other, I hope I may be able to show you. The party 'was broken up, according to ancient custom, as the clock was on the stroke of; twelve, but not until after we had joined'hands round the supper-table, and wished each other a "Merry Christmas" and a "Happy New Year." ;  ia   ,    ,       'I \,  " 'Tis heavy mist-'tis golden gloom; Strange shapes emerge in gray and white I I hear soft music in the air;  It breathes a sweet, unearthly strain." MY room was an octagonal chamber, that had formerly been one of the state apart- ments. The lofty ceiling was very curiously ' groined-; the arms of the founder being em- blazoned on the shield, forming a boss at the intersection of the ribs, the moulding of which had also been decorated with gold  ' and color.

Altogether, it was just such a place as, it is said, ghosts and goblins, love to' haunt. In- deed, the antique appearance of the room brought vividly to mind the haunted cham- ler of Dr. Von Schonberg's house in Stras- bourg, "And this is," said I to myself, "the anniversary of the night' on which St. Nich- olas, or at least a'goblin in his shape, ap- peared to me.'  My room was at the end of one 'of those long galleries usual in houses of the period, and as I passed along it, I paused at one of its numerous moonlit, mullioned windows, to view the scene without. The silyery tones of the merry Christmas bells, wafted from the distant parish, church, were rising and falling on the midnight   304    HDDEN TREASURE. breeze, and jubilant and plaintive by turns, seemed prophetic of the lights and shades of the coming year. The court-yard below seemed nearly half an acre in extent, and presented a picturesque appearance, withi its balustrades and vases glimmering among the evergreens in the light of a full moon., An oriel window corbelled over the arched gateway, stood out in bold relief against the dark background of ivy which covered its walls and turrets. The quiet scene, and the clumps of gnarled oaks scattered in groups over the park be- yond the walls of the court-yard, reminded me of that favorite ballad: "The moon, sweet regent of the sky, Silver'd the walls of Cumnor Hall, And many an oak that grew thereby." I thought of the quaint fun and merriment I had just witnessed; of the unexpected ap- pearance of my friend Fritz, in the charac- r  ter of St. NichoIas, or old Father Christmas,   HDDEN TREASURE.     305 and I thought also of the time when all this r grandeur, bustle, and animation should pass away; when these towers, like those of Cum- nor Hall, should be silent and deserted, even a s        ...:'         . , "In that manor now, no more  i Is cheerful feast and sprightly ball."

From time to time gusts of wind, which had risen, rdared about the old man- sion, rattling the casements and rumbling down the chimney. At'length, after fever- ishy tossing about on my downy couch, I fell into a troubled slumber, the events of the previous day presenting themselves to my imagination in a strange, fantastic vision; the phantasmagoria comprising a multitude of objects,--past, present, and to come.

By his side stood the fair Saba, the destined bride of St. George. As I beheld, in a state hovering between sleeping and waking, fear and expectation, the female figure changed into the form and features of Nichola Von Waldeck, as I had seen her once before, when, in the costume of the Krish-Kinkle, she was dispensing gifts beneath the Christmas-tree.' There were the same white dress with wings attached, and the golden zone with the crown of bay and holly worn on that memorable occasion, and now the hand of St. Nicholas was raised, as if in benediction, whilst there fell from the chaplet that encircled her brow, a shining veil of the most gossamer-like transparency, through which appeared the fairy-like figure of the Christ-Child, surrounded by a halo of supernatural glory, that filled the room with a rosy light. At the same time a solemn strain of music stole upon-me, swelling louder and/ louder until I started up, fully awake.   1?,     HDDEN TREASURE.     309 The music was indeed real, and so was the rosy light streaming, not from the fire- place, but through the window near it. i Donning my dressing-gown and slippers, I ascertained that the voices were, those of a Christmas-wait, who, with lighted torches, were making their rounds, thus carolling in, as it were, the dawn of that day, foretold of old, in which the "uSun of Righteousness" should "'arise with healing in His wings." As it'was yet scarcely dawn of day, I thanked them for the agreeable surprise, and wishing them a "Merry Christmas," returned to bed, where I slept soundly, until awakened by the bell for breakfast.  I shall not give you any further details of our Christmas festivities, because the arrival of the stage-coach is momentarily expected. If, however, you are curious in such matters, I will refer you to a recently-published "Ac- count of a Christmas Prince," as it was ex- hibited in the University of Oxford, in the year I607,-a work of inestimable Value to   3Io     HDDEN TREASURE., the would-be restorers of ancient manners  and customs, and to those who, like the inmates of Sandal's, Manor, would      keep "an old-fashioned-and right merry Christ- mas."*  As for the visi/on I have    mentioned, it  appears to   have  been decidedly . ominous of evil, for, -soon after my return to   col- ' lege, my friend  Fritz, with whom  I kept up a constant correspondence, informed me that *The only publication of a similar nature is that of 1 the Chlristmas Prince of Gray's Inn, in 1594, which  -was printed in 1688, under the following title:-.' ,  "Gesta Grayorum; or, The History of the High and Mighty Prince, Henry Prince of Purpoole, Arch- ' duke of StapulilL and Bernardia, Duke of High. and Nether Holborn, Marquis of St. Giles and Tottenham ,  i Count Palatine of Bloomsbury and Clerkenwell, Great Lord of the Cantons of Islington, Kentishtown, Pad-  dington, and Knightsbridge, Knight of the  Most,  Heroical Order of the Helmet, and Sovereign of the ' same, who reigned and died, A D.

Her mother's uinrea- sonable prejudice in favor of high birth, to- gether with threatened loss of fortune from the failure of bankers in' whom Madame had placed too much confidence, left her, indeed, scarcely any other choice. "Ah, then," said I, "it was not a bridal veil that I had seen falling over the fair Krish-Kinkle, in that bright vision at San-, dal's Manor, nor was that silent benediction a foreshadowing of the marriage ceremony, as I had fondly hoped. The mystical figure, in pontificalibus, could not have been the good St. Nicholas, but rather that mischie- vous goblin, Number Nip, whom, before'now, I had known to assume his shape. Indeed, my head, to say nothing of my heart, still ached at the recollection of the kick the runaway horse bestowed upon me on that   312  -  H IDDEN TREASURE. unlucky Christmas-eve, when the goblin, mounted  a postilion, drove Madam Von Waldeck's carriage so furiously against a tree.

Before scrambling up to our lofty perch on top of .the coach, m) old friend Nick made me promise to visit him at his bache- Ior's quarters in St. John's College, where he was still domiciled; having, it appeared, on taking his degree, obtained a fellowship. "'You shall then hear the rest of my story," said he, "over a toast and tankard of that   HDDEN TREASURE!     313 famous 'October,' of which we so often heard in days when a fellowship in an Eng- lish university seemed far enough removed.

The coat of arms- "(De Gutles a la Fasce d'Or "-was that of the Chamilly family. It immediately brought to mind the strange story my friend Niclholas Boughton h'ad told me, when, on that mysti- cal Eve of St. Johln, we had dined together at Highgate. "Can it be," said I to myself, ,'that the '    HDDEN TREASURE.    315 old marcuis has come to life again, or that the racketing'spectre in his shape, which, in  Strasbourg, is said 'to walk,' has now be- taken itself to a coach?" I must have been under a strong magnetic influence, for whilst I was staring at what seemed to be an apparition, and wishing for some one to read me the riddle, -who should appear at the door of the shop, as if conjured up by the thought, but old Nick himself! I do not mean the arch enemy in hoofs and ; horns, but my story-telling friend of the Gate-house Inn. The seven years which had passed seemed to have made little difference in his appear- ance, except for the better--expanse of waistcoat indicating considerable progress in rotundity-and that he was not now alone, but accompanied by a lady. : The recognition was mutual. After the greeting usual on such occasions, he turned to his fair companion, saying: "Allow' me, madam, to present to you an old college   3I6 O   HDDEN TREASURE. friend, of whom you have often heard me speak." The lady, who was still. young, apparently not above thirty, and decidedly handsome, with sunny-brown hair, and eyes of deepest blue, received me with a gracious smile,- amused, boubtless, at my look of amaze- ment. "I perceive," said he, ']that you are aston- ished at the altered circtlmstances ,in which youlffd me; but come nd tcine with us at ohlr hotel,-and you shall hear'all about it." I observed that the card which he thrust into my-hand, as he was stepping into the car- riage, was that of the Marquis de Chamilly. Wondering greatly at the luck which seemed to have transformed my rather needy collegee friend into a, dashing French marquis, withlla'handsome wife into the bar- gain, I, at the hour appointed, presented my- self, in proper trim, at the hotel where they were staying. :' \At dinner, after the cloth had been re-   HDDEN TREASURE. '   31 7  , / moved, the marquis--as I must now call him- -continued the story so abruptly broken off . at Highgate:  Soon after that pleasant- dinner of ours, said he, I made a discovery of the greatest importance. I think I then told you that among the letters I found ins the old cabi- net, was one in cipher, from the late marquis to his cousin Oberlin, the librarian of Stras- bourg. The key'of this I at length discov- ered, with the help of a learned friend, the Rev. John Smith, who was skilled in such matters, having successfully deciphered the famous "Pepys Papers." The letter turned out to be a full and complete confession on the part of the mar- quis, made in the prison of the Luxembourg, after the Marquise and the Count de Cha- milly, their son, had fallen victims to the fury of the French Revolution, and shortly before his own decapitation in 1 794. It appeared from this confession, which, in many particulars, coincided with the state- !,a           .   3'8 ,   HDDEN TREASURE. ment my uncle had already nlade, that the marquis had in early youth, when on a visit to Ireland, contracted a clandestine marriage with a wild, untutored Irish girl of great per- sonal beauty.  The marriage was kept strictly secret, the children born being, for convenience' sake, supposed to be illegitimate, His ,father, ignorant of the mesalliance of his son, had chosen for him a French lady, his equal in rank. Disgust for a marriage thus negotiated, the young noblemran took no pains to conceal. However, his conduct in the matter excited no particular attention- in those days of State alliances. With the the cause of his unwillingness he dared not acquaint his father, for fear of being disin- herited. For a long tihme, said the confession, he succeeded in quieting the reproaches of his conscience by Sophistical reasoning, such as the morality and Jesuitical education of the   HDDEN. TREASURE.    31 9  lay sanctioned. Mqreover, he had artfully btained an opinion from an eminent English awyer on the subject of clandestine marri- axges, from which he was erroneously led to believe that his own marriage in Ireland was, at least-in the eye of the law, null and void. But the calamity which the French Revo- lution had brought on him and his family, which seemed like a just retribution, at length convinced him of his criminal- error, and he now sought, by this tardy confession, to make such acknowledgments .and restitution as, might still be in his power. ,He declared,'with many expressions of penitence and regret, that the sons of that clandestine marriage, whom he fhad brought up and provided for as his natural children, should now have the benefit of his confes- sion; that the marriage certificate, together with his will, and other valuable deeds and documents, would be found in a safe place of deposit, the secret of which was known to his correspondent, who was charged to seek ,  1  6!'    320    HDDEN TREASURE.- out these children, so long and unjustly de- prived of their birthright. On the back of this letter was endorsed, in the handwriting of Oberlin, a note, to the effect that he had made diligent inquiry for the Bouton brothers, but in' consequence, probably, of the war then raging between France and England, he could get no answer to the letters he had addressed to them. Immediately one the ldeciphering of this , letter, my uncle and I determined to cross over to the continent. At Strasbourg, meeting my friend Fritz, l who had been apprized of the object of our visit, we went directly to the old house of Dr. Von Sch nberg, where, for reasons which I did not think it necessary to ex- \, plain, perhaps for fear of ridicule, I was I convinced that the hidden treasure was ,concealed,-the very treasure, it might, be, which -the racketing spectre, or rather the good St. Nicholas, had intended that I should discover. The fact that my fair friend,   HDDEN TREASURE.    321 Nichola Von Waldeck (still remembered with tender regret), had once predicted such a happy result, added not a little to e the interest of the pursuit. Fritz, however, on this occasion, stipulated that he should be allowed the sole manage- ment of the affair. On reaching the haunted chamber in the old house, my uncle observed, on looking around, that he had been here before, and in the lifetime of Oberlin who then occupied the house. , "I had called on him,"' said he, "thinking that he might throw some light on the his- tory of our family.: But the old gentleman appeared to be very infirm, and to be suffer- ing particularly from loss of memory. He told me that he once had in his possession some valuable documents relating to the subject, which he had carefully put away, but could not, for the life of him, recollect, where. He went directly to this same old cabinet, and although he opened every f 4   '4   322    HDDEN TREASURE. I? drawer and receptacle, he could find nothing  that could be, of service.". My friend Fritz, who had listened to my uncle with attention, "exclaimed, "Gentlemen, I think I can assist in unravelling this mystery, with the lielp of the good-St. Nicholas, who seems to preside, over the destinies of your family. But,-as I said, you must allow me to' do it in my own way; that is, secuzndem arterm."'  Thus saying, our mercurial friend ar- ranged the lights, as if for some scenical effect, and then retired, sa ing that he would  be with us again very soon.}i By the' way, whilst I Fas at St. John's College, Fritz had made an extended eastern tour, where,. among astrologers and alchem-  i ists, he had made considerable progress in those magical studies for which Egypt and Arabia have, from the earliest times, been celebrated. Indeed, he had given so much attention to the subject, that-his uncle had expressed serious anxiety lest he should take   'HDDEN TREASURE.    323 As we silently awaited his return, won- dering what he could be at, we heard ap- proaching the solemn tramp of mysterious footsteps, such as, in other days, I had some- times listened to with awe, when alone in this same apartment, Presently the footsteps of this invisible per- son were followed by a succession of raps, sounding louder and louder. This was suc- ceeded by a voice, the tones of which were & perfectly familiar. "Nick," said the voice. The sound evidently proceeded from the picture, which, as we looked up, appeared -  to be animated, as I had seen it once before,  on a certain Christmas-eve, when it had  descended from its elevated position, to con-  verse with me beside the fireplace.  , The loud laugh which saluted our be-      , rildered look, apprized us of the fact that   I the picture had been quietly moved aside,   j turning silently on its well-oiled hinges, and in the place of' that gorgeously,arrayed   '  ecclesiastical worthy, there now stood, not :' " o    .    324    HDDEN TREASURE. the ghost of any o f the Chamilly family, nor even that of the good St. Nicholas, but the substantial flesh and blood of my whilom colaborer in experimental philosophy,' Fritz Von Schonberg, arrayed in the, identical ha- biliments in which he had appeared at San- dal's Manor, in the character of Old Father Christmas. I think," said he, " you have seen me be- fore in this garb; but never standing thus, as it were, in the very shoes of Papa Noel him- self. If you will move that chair and table this way, I will help you up." Taking a candle, we mounted to the plat- form within the picture-frame; following him through a narrow passage, and up a fight of several steps, constructed in the thickness of the wall, we found ourselves, at length, in a low-roofed' apartment, 'which appeared to be in the turret above the small octagonal chamber that opened into the antiquely-fur- nished room we had just left. Our masquerading guide pointed out to ,-     \ * .   HDDEN TREASURE.  -  325 ' us an artfully-concealed trap-door in the ceil- ing, which, he observed, opened into a closet communicating with. the apartment occupied by hi!m,' when he had been an occasional visitor at the house.: Immediately on our entrance, Fritz busied himself with a conjuring rod of hazel-wood, marvellously like the one St. Nicholas had left behind him in his haste^ on that mem- orable Christmas-eve. These things, together with a magic lan- tern, and other contrivances used by magi- cians of modern times, were very suggest- ive;, and I now no longer wondered that a house with such convenient places for hide- and-seek should. have the reputation of be- ingc haunted. I thought of the audible sigh and the rustling sound that had proceeded on that Christmas-eve from the old picture over the mantel-piece. Could it have been my friend Fritz, standing thtere in the guise of St. Nicholas, and had I really been en- tranced by that magnetic influence which he   326     HDDEN TREASUIE.  C was said to possess, or was I dreaming at the tithe? for it is said one may dream with one's eyes wide open, believing one's self, to  be all the while wide awake.      ' All this while' Fritz was manipulating the' divining-rod with much mock solemnity, the forked rod, swayed apparently by some mysterious- power, pointed, after sundry gy- \ rations, to a the in the floor, which, upon inspection, appeared to have been loosened., : "Y-Here it mutst be," said he; and sure enough, there, embedded in plaster, was the very casket referred to in the confession of the murdered marquis. 'It was of metal, and on the lid was engraved a text from the prophet Jeremiah, which seemed to have reference to that fear- - ful political deluge,-the French Revolution. Translated, it read: "Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: HOUSES AND : FIELDS AND VINEYARDS' SHALL BE POSSESSED AGAIN IN THS LAND. \  , .     *. . i*   CHAPTER   XVII. "This is the day, wherein to all myfriends, I will pronounce the happy words, ' Be rich!'" THE ALCHEMST. THE discovery we had now made was doubtless that hidden treasure over which the racketing spectre that haunted the house had for so many years kept unremitting watch.  The unearthed casket contained- the evi- dences we were seeking; for, besides title- deeds, and a number of costly gems, upon which were engraved strange cabalistic and heraldic devices, was found-t e duly-attested marriage certificate, needed to establish the legitimacy of my father and uncle, and their claim to the name and arms of the Chamilly family. It also appeared that my father was the elder of the twin brothers.   328  -  HDDEN TREASURE. I need not expatiate on the legal proceed- igs that followed the discovery of this hidden treasure. It suffices to say that in  the end they established our rights, not only to social rank, but to As much of our ances- tral estates as had been left by the French Revolution; for at the restoration, all that' the government of Louis XVIII. could do, was toreturn to their rightful owners such domains as had not been alienated. Here Nick-I should now say the mar- quis-lit a cigar, for he had given up the meerschaum, since his marriage, and puffed away for some time in silence., "But," observed I, after waiting! awhile in expectation, "( there are some things which you have not yet explained. Which of the' charming young ladies mentioned in the narrative  did M. le Marquis marry? for, according to established rules of' romance, it should have been one of them.  Was it the dashing cousin, or that more spirituelle young lady, whose life you Iiad saved at the       t   HDDEN TREASURE.    329 risk of your own on a certain Christmas-eve, and who, on the anniversary of that same holy night, under the protection of the good , St. Nicholas, appeared to you at the princely ,country-seat of your uncle?" At first, said the marquis, hesitating a lit- tle, there was some talk of a match between my cousin 'and myself. My uncle and our newly-found relative of Ballyracket were said to be very anxious to bring about the marriage; 'for it would reunite an ancient family, in danger of'becoming extinct. The young lady, however, interposed insuperable Objections to this convenient arrangement, for, although at first she seemed to favor the projected alliance, she very soon com- pelled me to change my course toward her, by making demands which I felt it-would be impossible for me to comply with. For she insisted that- I should not only settle upon her the property she might inherit from her grandfather, but also any that i might my- self hold, or hereafter acquire. Perhaps , i   330    HDDEN TREASURE. - she may have heard that the childless pro- prietor of Ballyracket intended-to make me his heir. Whatever miay have been her, motive, such a proposition, in disregard of the reversionary interests of my brother and I sister, was entirely out of the question. However, these negotiations were at? length broken off, in a rather startling and unexpected manner, and that was by my     friend Fritz running away with the capri-  ! cious object of our matrimonial schemes. It seems that a mutual attachment had  ' sprung up between them, dating from the celebrated Christmas revels at Sandal's Manor, on which merry occasion Fritz had; made a practical application of those prin-f ciples of animal magnetism, as laid idown by him in that periodical, the A=nnales dz Mfagndtisme Animal, to which you know he  was a contributor.  - My  uncle was very angry at this unex- pected turn of affairs, but relented, and par- doned the couple at- my,earnest intercession. 't   HDDEN TREASURE.    331I Soon after the reconciliation thus effected, this virtuous and disinterested conduct of  v mine met with its fitting reward; for I now learned that my first love, who had so sud- denly, and, as it subsequently appeared, un-  willingly, taken the veil, had tired of her clois- i tered life. Fortunately, the mistake made ' in her vocation was not irreparable. I may .h not have mentioned it, but she had professed  i in that picturesque old convent of Lichten- - thai, where the nuns, I found, have the peculiar privilege of taking the veil for only I seven years; she could, therefore, without any impropriety, return to this world at the end of that period, if so inclined. Hearing that I was not to marry my   ) cousin, as she had been led to suppose, and that my sentiments -toakld her were still unchanged, and that St. Nicholas had com- pleted the good work begun so many years before, by restoring to me, my birthright, she consented, at my earnest solicitation, and with the approbation of the Lady Abbess--a   332    HDDEI TREASURE.  by no means bigote devotee-and who was, happily, als6 her aunt; to leave the convent of Lichtenthal, where, surrounded by all that is beautiful in nature and art, her daily life sanctified by the. offices of religion, away from the haunts of folly and fashion, she had preserved a rose-like. ifreshness,- that made her, at twenty-five, as youthful in appearance as when I  had parted from her seven years before; on the garden -terrace at 'Baden- Baden. You may be sure, in persuading her again to take the veil-and this time for my sake - that I did not forget to insist upon the prophetic character of the beautiful vision 'vouchsafed to, me at Sandal's' Manor. In- deed, that mysterious occurrence was de-l clared by the Lady Abbess to be an unan-I swerable argument in favor of the match, l r proving that it had been made where good matches should be,--in heaven. "There is another question I should like to ask, Monsieur. What has become of the  W -     ,   t    \ HDDEN TREASURE3 3 33 old cabinet, and of the magical picture so closely connected with the history of the Chamilly-family?"  Why, said he, I have acquired possession of the old house, with all it contained, for it came to me by a sort of inheritance, having been saved from the sale of my grandfather's property by' Oberlin and his brother, who held it in trust, as it were, for the heirs not then apparent. If you will come to Stras- bourg, I will take great pleasure in showing' it to you, and you can take your after-din- ner nap, in the same old arm-chair in which, in a state between sleeping and waking, I once listened to the homily of. the good ' St. Nicholas, a sermon which proved to be a profitable discourse, in spite of somno- lency. I can assure you, however, that the pic- ture has never since been seen to descend from its lofty perch above thl mantel-piece. As for the cabinet which, from the clatter about it, I thought at one time might fly , l.   334    HDDEN TREASURE. away, bodily, it seems also to have subsided  into a state, of permanent quiescence, per- haps for the reason that the mission of the goblin was accomplished when the hidden treasure was discovered. For you know that the belief here is that buried treasure allows its guardian spirits no rest until it is raised, and that an unfinished work, an un- fulfilled promise, forces them back to the up- per world. ' But the literary treasure that it contained proved to be of far greater value than any one would have supposed, for the perusal of those old books on alchemy led me to the modern, study of metallurgy, without the knowledge of which I should not have dis- covered those treasures of mineral wealth hidden beneath theo barren soil of an estate in the Vosges--the' remnant of a large property once belonging to the Marquis of Chamilly. Indeed, Dr. Von Schonberg's jocular pre- diction as to the-beneft to be derived from - -     HDDEN TREASURE.    335 the study of alchemy has been, in an unex- pected manner, verified; for have I not dis- covered something like the philosopher's stone; or, at least, the art of transmuting the baser metals, such as iron,: into gold? albeit, by an industrial process very different from that dreamed of by the hermetic philosophers of the olden time.             ' In a word as I have since learned my friend was as much indebted for the honora- ble position he had acquired to good char- acter, steadily maintained, and to skill and address in profiting by opportunities, as he was to fortune, or to anyconjuncture of the heavenly bodies, however propitious they may have been.             - As for- the elixir vita'-that other cherished dream of the alchemists-I think Ihave dis- covered something as good as- that wonder- working medicament. It was not, to be sure, in a compound from rare herbs grow- ing on' Mount Sinai, or in Arabia,"but in that rose of Sharon, blooming in the gardens of !  , .         .   336     HDbEN TREASURE. Lichtenthal,-in short, in  the young wife bestowed upon me by the good St. Nicho- las; and I may truly say, that of all the hid- den ,treasures discovered by me, this was best- worth the finding.  Not that I would despise those   others secreted in the old cabinet and turret chamber, and hidden be- neath the barren soil of the mountains of the Vosges. Oh, no. These worldly and much-coveted gifts were all very well in their way, but then they werex chiefly valued because they may be said to have served as stepping-stones to that chiefest of them all. Indeed, my' friend's lofty claim  was not without foundation, for had he been in pos- session of that elixir vite which Cagliostro, in the past generation, had so liberally dis- pensed to the good people of Strasbourg,* he could scarcely have looked younger. * Count Cagliostro, the latest great professor of the Rosicrucian philosophy, in I78o, took a magnificent hotel in Strasbourg. His wealth appeared to be boundless, ^  "     i   HDDEN TREASURE.       337- Yes, said he, in- response to my expres- sion of the thought, my advice to you and other old  bachelors is, that you try  the same g-rande elixir, and that, when you find yourself beginning to grow Oid, you resort to the arcanum which I have, both by pre- ,cept and example,' recommended.

After his death the room was reported to be haunted,!, and, as suclh; many attempts were made to sleep in it, Ibutin vain; and such is the credulity of the lower people, that it was with difficulty any laborer could be prevailed on to assist in pulling it down (I792); the ghost of this one-handed gentleman, I was told, by persons on the, spot, had been frequently. seen by their fathers, riding across the neighboring grounds in a coach-and-six; and, with the same air of confidence, I was informed:'that, within the present century, his per- turbed spirit, had been laid by a numerous body of the clergy, who conjured it into a vial, and threw it   r    s 342        APPENDIX,           i into a 'marl-pit' opposite the house. Nor does the family seem to have been exempt from a similar super- stition and belief in ghosts; for it is told of the lat, Sir Theodosius's father, that, being visited by a neigh- bor, the late Sir Francis Skipwith, and walking together near the marl-pit, Sir Francis observed that he thought there must be many fish in that pond, and that he would be glad to try it; to which Sir Edward -gravely replied: 'No,-that I cannot consent to; for the spirit of my ancestor, the One-banded Boughton, lies there.' "--[ireland's Avaon and Stratfard.]   APPENDIX.        343 The sudden death of Sir Theodosius Bo ughton, dur- ing his minority, ,' caused an extraordinary sensation at the period it occurred. Sir Theodosius was confined to his bed by a severe indisposition, at the family man- sion of Lawford Hall, wherein his mother and Captain and Mrs. Donellan (his sister and brother-in-law) were at the time residing. Having taken a draught from the hands of Lady Boughton, the unfortunate gentle- man almost immediately expired, 2ist August, I780. Suspicion of poison subsequently arising,. the biody, after being deposited in the family vault (beneath the Church of Newhold), was disinterred, when a coroner's inquest returned a verdict of murder against'Captain Donellan, who was tried, condemned, and executed for the crime, at the Spring Assizes for the Co. Warwick, 178I. It must be remarked, however, in justice to the memory of Mr. Donellan, that the evidence against him was solely circumstantial, and not of the strongest nature; and that he died solemnly protesting his inno- cence.

There is a notice in the Biographie Universelle o01 one of the Chlamilily family, who, as late as the time of Louis XVI., held at Court the honorable appointment of "premiervalet-de-chambre."  It appears also that this nobleman was a zealous adherent of royalty, and that' he perished on the scaffold, in the prison of the Luxembourg, in 1794. Possibly he may be identical with the decapitated Marquis mentioned, in the story of Hidden Treasure, the coincidence of time and place strengthening the supposition. 't   APPENDIX.         345 IV. St. Nicholas belongs to the fourth century of the Christian era. All accounts agree that he was a native of Patara, in Lycia, a large and ancient province of Asia, in which *St. Paul had planted the faith. Myra, the capital, three miles from Patara and the sea, 4was an archiepiscopal seC of so great dignity, that in later ages- thirty-six suffragan bishoprics were subject to it. St. Nicholas early distinguished himself by his exercises of devotion, charity; and perfect obedience, and after living in seclusion as Abbot of the Monastery of Holy Sion, near Myra, for several years, he was chosen Archbishop of Myra, in which high calling he became noted for his humility and zeal, and active benevolence, or, as Alban Butler says, " for his extraordinary piety and zeal, and an incredible number of stupendous miracles." The    ; Greek lpistories of his life agree that he 'suffered im- prisonmernt for the faith!, and made a glorious confes- sion in the latter part of the persecution raised by Dio- cletian, and that he was present at the great, Council of Nice, where " he appeared like a sun amongst so tmany stars," and in his zeal for ortlhodoxy, is said to have given Arius C" a box on the ear; " hence, probably, the rod still bestowed by himr on those deserving it. St. Nicholas became one of the' most popular saints in Christendom.       ' Chambers says: "Perhaps no saint has enjoyed a more extended popularity. By the Russian nation he   C has been adopted as their patron, and in England, no - '. .i' . " .* 1!  '   346         APPENDIX. fewer than three hundred and s eventy-two churches are named, in his honor.  He is regarded as the special guardian of virgins, of children, and of sailors. Schol- ars were under his protection, aLnd from the circumstance of these being anciently denominated clerks, the frater- nity ofparis/h clerks placed themselves likewise under the guardianship of St. Nicholas. He even .came to be regarded as the patron of robbers from an alleged adventure with thieves, whom he compelled to restore some stolen goods to their proper owners." The Greek like the Latin Church pays great honor to the Archbisho of Myra. There are few large towns in Europe without a church, and still fewer Cathedrals without an altar dedicated to him. "In convents oil the Continent;" says Mr. Cham- bers, "the young-lady boarders used on the eve of St. Nicholas' Day (Dec. 6th) to place silk stocklings at the door of the apartment of the Abbess, with a paper recommending themselves to ' Great St. Nicholas of her chamber,' an allusion, doubtless, to the munificence - recorded of the saint in the celebrated legend which bears reference to his protectqrship of virgins. "St. Nicholas is called particularly the patron saint of children, not only because he made their instruction a principal part of his pastoral care, but chiefly because he always retained the virtues, the meekness, the simplic- ity, without guile or malice, and the humility of his tender age, and in his very infancy devoted himself to God by a heroic piety. ,These reasons are given in the ancient MS. book of Festivals at Sarum."
