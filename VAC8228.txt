That nest of political heresies was to be broken up,; but so generally did' they obtain among the people, and the first invaders experienced such a warm reception, that they soon changed the seat of their operations to other parts of the country, where opinions were more divided. The seat of War being thius removed from their own doors, the s-ons of the Pilgrims went forth to aid their brothers in arms,--it mattered not where, whether among w the swamps of Virginia, the fens of Georgia, or along the rugged frontiers of the Canadas. Thus joined in a common cause, they were largely instrumental in moulding into an har- monious whole that republican Union that was destined to go on in a career of prosperity and greatness unexampled in the world's history, until the insidious seeds of toryism and anti-republicanism, still left- in some parts of the country, should take such root as to threaten the re-establishment of a privileged aristocracy, and to found an oligarchy of wealth and rank on the ruins of democracy. 'At this time, the power of the Indians in New England had been destroyed. The tribes had either been scattered to the winds, or were compelled to submit -to the laws im- posed bytheir conquerors. The stragglers and remnants of tries were broken in spirit, harmless ands miSerable. With no future for themselves as a people, they seemed- willing to hasten their own extermination by falling unreluctantly into the destroying vices of idleness and intemperance. The savage having been overcome,: and the civilized invader who had stimulated him to his deeds of midnight slaughter hav- ing been driven away, the contry, from one end to the other, was fast emerging into the prosperity of peace. The larger part of the New England of to-day was then a wil- derness; and the soldiers who- had returned fNom the war after the long service of seven years generally found them- selves with nothing but their own hard hands to rely upon for support. But they had a fertile country of boundless extent, free and secure; and they were satisfied. . They were content with the issue of the war, though their little for- tunes had, during its continuance, been all dissipated and lost, their families broken up, and the bones of' their fathers and brothers were whitening alike the soil of every State from Canada to the Gulf. Of those who thus went forth to -the war were the four , t    A. FAMLY HSTORY. .   '     5 sons of the widow Gomery of Dorchester. The father was one of the first martyrs to the cause, having fallen at Bun- ker's Hill.- His oldest son, then  a youth of twenty-three, also took part in that action; and, from that day till he-was i surprised and ,treacherously slain. t the board of a Soiith- Carolina Tory, he never, for a single day, was out of the colonial service.  The three other sons also enlisted soon after the affair at Bunker's Hill; their high-spirited and patri- otic mother cutting up her- bed-blarikets to make coats and pantaloons for them, and telling them not to return till the British were driven beyond the seas. And they literally obeyed her admonition; for two of them did::not return at all, and -the third, the youngest, not till after the surren. der of Cornwallis. And, when at last he wended his way back to the place of his birth, it was to find the remnants of' his father's property all gone for the support of his widowed mother, who, broken down by hardship and anxiety, had, .for the last year, been indebted to the betrothed wife of her only living son for her maintenance. The faithful Huldah Tappan had been to her a support, instead of husband. and sons, and had submitted to menial and servile labor that she might supply the wants of the mother of him sheolobved. Her fidelity was in time rewarded; for, as soon as the army was disbanded, Robert Gomery returned, and hastened to- redeem his pledge of years before. The capital with which this worthy couple commenced life consisted of their own willing hands and loving hearts. A -free and vast courntry was open to them "-where' 'to choose ;"and it was their intentiron, when first married, to make their way into the wilderness, and find their home in the -as yet unbroken forest. But the old lady was too in, firm to bear the hardships of the journey, or the life that might be anticipated when the new home was reached: so, for the time, they continued to reside in Dorchester, content to remain, if necessary to the comfort and happiness of thie good old mother. But her days after her son's return were few. -Within a vear after his marriage, she slept her last sleep, thankful in her heart that in her humble way she had ' been able to contribute her mite-indeed it was all the liv- ing that she had -to the cause of liberty; not doubtin lbut that, in another world, she would share with those she loved the reward of well-doing. ' .               .::   .   6       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: Robert G  Cmery, when the last rites had been performed for his last of kin, resolved to carry into effect his cherished purpose of going back into the forest, and there making himself a home. With that idea, he set forth on foot and alone to seek for an eligible spot. Hq had a pack on his back containing a few changes of raiment, and as much pro- visionas he could well carry without making his load iso heavy as to impede his journey. He was a brisk walker: for  before this he had followed his country's invaders for many days and nights with musket and knapsack, and had been followed by them, too, in turn, when there was no need of bloodhounds to aid in the pursuit; for the blood on the snow and frozen ground but too clearly showed the course of the Continentalers. His present journey he therefore thought but play, as with a young and loved wife behind him, and a new home adorned with the luxuries and comforts that a vivid imagination conjured up before him, he whis- tled over the rugged road happier than ever king led forth an army with banners. 'The -evening of the fifth day of his travels and explora- tions found him at the door of a log-house, the oiwner of which was a war veteran like himself, who had got a year's start of him in his forest home. This man gave Gomery a hearty welcome, and urged him to settle in his neighbor- hood. This he promised to do if he did not find a spot to please him better during the next day's travel. The host, whose name was Ransom Greenfield, assured him that the soil in the vicinity was deep and rich, the climate healthy, and that as pretty a tract as lay out of doors was still un- claimed near by. These were strong temptation's; and so was the company of Greenfield, whose war experiences had been of the hardest kind; and the two entertained each other till a late hour, recounting the scenes of other days. The next morning, however, they were both up betimes;  " and Robert Gomery, having laid in a substantial breakfast, bade-his newly-made acquaintance good-by, and was on ,his way again agood hour before the sun showed his' merry face above the hills. He diligently pursued his way along the trail, vhich was called a road since wheeled vehicles had passed over it; and, just as the sun was fairly above the highest -peaks, he emerged from a thick and heavy wood upon an open space, where he had a distinct view of a   i *                   ' , "A FAMLY' HSTORY.        7 large range of country, rarely diversified with upIand- aud  meadow, woods and openings. It was a beautiful sight. Nature never looked lovelier. -She was clothed in- her richest verdure; and the diamond drops pendent from leaf and twig shone and sparkled laughingly in the, bright morning sun. , But, looking beyond the prospect immediately around him, his eye rested on a high hill that stood forth in its native grandeur; and, as the early rays of thersun struck across it, he was so charmed with its appearance, that he determined that on the side of that hill should be his future home. : e sat down, and contemplated the scene for a full hour; and the air-castles he built within that time, could he have rented them at -a fair rate, would have made him a millionnaire at once. He descried at that distance the appearance of a clearing, which somewhat damped his ardor; for he feared that already it was taken up by some" earlier pioneer. He at length resumed his journey; and by twelve o'clock he /reached the house of another settler, less than half a dozen miles from the base of the hill on which his eyes had rested so covetously in the morning. The occupant of this house was a man by the name of Asa Fisher. He, too, had-been in the war; but, being wounded at Saratoga, was sent home, and did not take the field again. - He had now a wife and four children; and they lived in a snug log-house having only two small rooms, but large enough to hold a-great deal of happiness. Our traveller 'here,' too, found and honest- and hearty Welcome; for a stranger from the settlements was, to the dwellers in the forest, equal to a file ofs newspapers; and could tell them-of the important events of the day that had- transpired since last they had heard from he outer world. Asa had already pa sed the crisis of a pioneer's life; :that is, he had experienced the hardest seasons which he had any reason to anticipate when he first sought a home in the for, est. He had effected a clearing of twenty acres, and raised each year all the Indian corn, wheat, potatoes, and other vegetables required by his family, and cut grass enough to keep through the long winter a yoke of oxen,-some cows, a few sheep, and a- horse. -The difficulties and deprivations of the first year or two, before any thing could be raised-from the snoil, were all over; and Asa was already a. contented and well-to-do settler. He gave; Robert Gomery a fra nk welcome, ,*-            A G    ,   .c o  e I    f   GOMERY OF MONTGOMNERY -: and was overjoyed then he learned that he was looking for a place whereon to settle anhd make it his home. He too, like Greenfield, and as all pioneers are prone to do, assured him that his neighborhood possessed advantages above any other within many miles. The land was excellent and cheap, the climatehealthy; and there was already a grist-mill within twenty miles. The hill which had struck Robert's eyes in the morning as- so beautiful and inviting was in full view from this house; and the clearing was fronting directly towards them. He inquired anxiously if that was already appropriated, and was -answered that it was inhabited no longer. "-How is that?" said Robert: "'tis a fine spot to look at." "There is a sad history connected ,with that place," an- swered Asa. "It is a long story; but, in as few words as pos- sible, I will tell you all about it. You see it is a lovely place to look upon, - the finest in all this section ; and, long be- fore any other place in this neighborhood was taken up, that spot was selected, and a man settled there by the name of Gault. We could never learn much about what kind of man he was; for it'was before the' war broke out that he struck his -axe there. We only know he had a wife that was monstrous pretty,-handsome as a picture. Well, he lived there all alone for some years, and had got a big clearing, as you see, and a good snug and swarm log house. He also had two children, so it was said: but that is not quite certain; for only one was ever heard of afterwards, and there is great doubt what became of that one. They were all killed by a straggling company ,of soldiers and Indians that passed through during the war. All that was ever known of them for certain was, that one'spring a small company of English, with about as many Indians, passed through this way, and by the trail-that leads over the hill and near the Arch Fountain; and some two or three weeks afterwards a couple of travellers passed through by the same trail, and, coming to *the house, -called to ask for entertainment. The house had an air of death-like stillness; and, before dismounting, they called aloud to ascertain if it was inhabited. But, receiving no answer, one of them got off his horse, and pushed open the door; and what do you suppose he saw?" "I am sure I have no idea." "There, in front of the fireplace, lay the half-consumed   A FAMLY HSTORY.     and half-decayed body of the murdered woman; and around it lay the' extinguished brands of wood, where they had evi- dently been placed and set on fire by the murderers, with the intention of burning the house, and thus destroying all signs of their horrid work. But, from appearances, the fire had expired of itself, and without setting the house on fire. Hor- ror-struck, the travellers gazed upon the sight, and then looked about the hous6 and clearing for other signs of the murderers' tracks. Walking along a trail that led to the spring, a little ways from'the house (and from its shape called ' the Arch Fountain, though the Indians call it 'The Weeping Angels'), from which the family obtained their water, and which was so clear and cool that the place had long been known as a sort of camping-ground for parties travelling through this way, they found the bones of a man, from which' a gaunt wolf stole away, as they approached, and a flock of carrion crows were hovering about. There was an axe lying near the 'skeleton. The travellers could form little idea, from the appearances, of the way the people had been murdered. They inferred that the woman was first killed, and the burn- ing firebrands piled around her; and that, as the savages were leaving the house, they met Gault, and shot him-in his tracks, and left him to feed the crows. The house had been robbed of almost everything valuable, and both victims had been scalped. At that time, there was nobody living within twenty miles of the place; and the travellers dug a grave for the unfor- tunate people, and buried them, and carefuilly 'observed every circumstance, in order to report to the friends of the deceased if they should ever learn who they were. They observed in the house a variety of children's clothes, some intended for a boy, and some for a girl; but no trace or sign besides of boy or girl could they find, except in the family Bible they found recorded:     -         ^ Married.

JUDITH GAULT, born Sept. 4, 1776.    10    'GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: "The next page contained only the printed word DIE &aHS; for under it no record had ever been made. But, though they looked in every place, they could:find no trace of these children. It was nearly sunset before the travellers left the place, And it was a long time before any investigation was made into that dreadful affair. The boy, it was afterwards said, was not there at the time, but had been sent off to some of his relations in the settlements." "And so the place was abandoned, and is now left open to the first one that comes, along?" said Gomery. "Why, yes: it is open to any one that cares to take it. But there is another-part to the story, which, when you have' heard it, will cure you, as it has cured others of their par- tiality for it."  '"What is that? It will take a strong dose of objection to cure me." "The place is haunted."             9 "Haunted! Well, if that is all, I think I will pitch my tent there without looking farther. How? - who haunts it? I thought those old silly superstitions had all died out. Have you eve seen any ghosts about here?"  "No; but I have heard such strange stories about that place, and from such good sources, that though I don't really believe in ghosts, yet I can't doubt what they say. Since I hawe been here, there havre been along by here as many as 'half a .dozen different parties who had never heard of the house till they saw it, and, thinking it would be better to sleep under its roof than in the open air, have done so. But 'they always saw strange sights, and left in the night terribly ;scared, and have -alwayis said they would not sleep in the house again for any money." "Why, what did they see?" "Children, leave the room!" This order was obeyed by the three eldest children; but the youngest, being yet in its mother's arms, was allowed to remain.' "I never talk about wild beasts or ghosts, or any thifg of that kind, before my children; and so they don't know there is such a thing in' the world."  I        ,  "As a ghost?-- probably not."            a !"As a ghost or wild beast either'; and hence they have  : no fear of any thing of the kind, and would gointo the woods 4I! of the darkest night without fear. There are some bears-and  wolves about; but they don't fear them." ' {  X   , A FAMLY HSTORY.         1 "Yes," said his wife, who had been giving her attention to her household affairs; '" and I raly b'eve, if either one of'em was to meet a bear in the road, he would 'run at and not run away from it."- "Less danger that way," said Asa. "You know-what the Scnpiture says: 'Resist thelDevil, and he will run away.'" "But how about the ghost?' said Robert, getting impatient. "I would like to see a ghost." "You can have a chance any night. The travellers that have stopped in that house all tell precisely the same story. They say, that, at about ten o'clock at night, a light shines up from the hearth, and reveals the face of a very pretty woman sitting on one side of the fireplace, holdin  a child's night- gown in -her hand. On the other side sits a man in his stockings, with a Bible in his lap, not reading, but lookinga at a little girl who stands on tiptoe between the two, as if going towards her mother, with her head thrown  back over her shoulder, looking arch and cunning at-her father. They say that, when they first see it, it is the prettiest sight they ever set eyes on: and all travellers report the same appearance, - the man on one side of the fireplace, the woman on the other; the child always in that position, her face turned away from the fire, and yet always giving out an illumination of its own  that renders every feature perfect. This illusion lasts but a moment, and all is darkness for a short time; when a noise of fire-arms is heard at a little distance from the house,' and then are} hear'd the shriek and stifled cries of a woman, and above all,- the piercing screams of a child. These continue for several minutes, growing gradually fainter till nothing can be heard but the spasmodic screams  and: sobbings of the child, that seem to die away in the distanCe; and then again is Athe house illuminated, and rising from the foor in front of the fireplace appears the body of the murdered woman,-her throat cut from ear to ear, and her eyes always open, and giv- ing forth a  light that t hey all say haunts 'em  and haunts em. A   good many are so badly scared that they do not stay to see it all through; but those that dp stay all have the same stoory. One man, who was a mightyihard sleeper, and who went to sleep before the- fire, and did not wake till the house was lit up for the last time, when h e saw the body of the woman beside-him,  with her throat cut :clear across, he jumped up, and run out of the house like mad land .he aever   -12      GO03.EIRY OF JMONTGOMEkRY  stopped till he got here, though he came barefoot, and had nothing on but his shirt and trousers. He was the scared- est man I ever saw when he got to my house at two o'clobk in the morning. But when I told him a great many othbrs had seen the same sights, and they had done them no harm, he got calmer, and, when it was light, went back to meet his companions and get his clothes."  A man of gentler experience or of weaker nerves than Robert Gomery might have been deterred from selecting a place with such terrible associations -as Gault's Hill, or Mount Gault as it was more frequently called, for his home. But he was not of the stuff to, be frightened. at an armed soldier, and much less at an unarmed ghost. Often, when sitting at the camp-fire with his companions, during his war experience, he had heard many marvellous tales of ghosts, witches, and hobgoblins. But the New England of that day had too many enemies in the flesh, to look after or give heed to those of the spirit. The re-action that ,had followed the persecu- -tion for witchcraft had caused almost total disbelief in all su- pernatural appearances. Hence the stories of ghosts and all sorts of strange apparitions usually had a very matter-of-fact explanation to them; and those persons who had been fright- ened by them had the-satisfaction of finding out that the ghosts: they had seen were no ghosts at all, but only the de- vices of wags and mad-caps. - Fisher's story, therefore, made small impression on Robert Gomery: and he told his entertainers that he was resolved to go to the hill that night, and to sleep in the house; and, if there were any ghosts wandering about the premises, he was determined to see them, and as: them what they wanted, and why they. revisited the earth, and on whom their troubled spirits sought vengeance ere they could sleep in peace. "I will have a long talk with them," he continued, laughing; "(and I will get all the late news from their country, and find out how all the dead folks are getting on." Fisher shook his head at this exhibition of incredulity, and said he would talk differently about them when he had seen them. ' "I have no doubt of it," said Gomery. Accordingly, with this resolution, at about three o'clock in the afternoon he set forth for Gault's, Hill. His hospitablej newly-found friends put some corn-bread and a slice of ham '   , *  *  ** -   '   *  ;. '  ^ . ,   k   ;          A FAML Y IIISTORY.  'y into his knapsack for his supper, of which Gomery said he : should invitef they would deign to taste of his cheer. Thus ridiculing the ghosts, he set forth, leaving his friends to theirssad misgivings. An hour and a half of brisk walking brought him to the clearing. The sun was now fast declining in the west; and, if he was pleased at the appearance of the place when viewed from  a distance in the morning, he was enchanted now that he stood upon it. There was a clearing of full twenty acres, having a soil black, rich, and loamy, and facing, with a moderate inclination, towards the south-east. The stumps of the trees that had been first felled-were some'of them en- tirely decyed , and a thick growth of raspberry and hazel bushes, and young saplings of beech, birch, and maple, were - fast growing in their places. But these could be easily sub- dued, and with little labor the whole space could be reduced to yield to the plough and the hoe. The log-house, though it had been built several years before, and had been unten- anted for most of the time, was still in a fair state of pres- ervation; though the door was no longer held in its place by its wooden hinges, and the roof of rifted oak needed relaying. "Two years of hard labor, two years at the least," said Rob- ert to himself, " would be required to reduce a tract so large as this to a condition so fitted to support a family. Ghost or no ghost, I will try it." He found the spot where Gault iand his wife were buriled. The grass was growing green and luxuriant from the little mound above them; and as Rob- ert Gomery looked upon it, and thought of their sad end, he heaved a   sigh, and uttered a prayer that his end might not be like theirs. The place was so still and tranquil, and so beautiful withal, that he fell into a fit of musing as he strayed along the trail towards 'the spring.  He was indulging in the illusion of a hopeful mind, and thinking he would make this place the   finest in the whole country. The forest should be levelled, and where it stood should be bright fields of waving grain, and broad pastires grazed by herds of cattle, horses, and sheep. A  grand 'house should be built on the most commanding spot, and huge barns to hold the as yet imaginary crops. While indulging in this pleasing dream, he came to the spring ofwhich Fisher had told him. This .spring was a natural curiosity. The hill here rose abruptly, and formed acave  or grotto some twent y feet in   GOMERY OF IONTGOMEsRY:            ' diameter. The arch overhead  as roug and jagged; and fi'om the point of a rock in the centre- was ever running a small stream of water, that fell, into a basin below. This basin was in the very centre of the'grotto; and around it were several large stones, that had evidently been placed there, to serve as seats, long, longhefore. Bu t that which had most attractednthe attention of the Indians, and caused them to have a sort of superstitious reverence for the place, was the peculiar form and position of the rocks that jutte d out Prom the farthest and darkest part of the cave, and un- less the day was clear, and the light strong, gave them the appearance of twdo lhumaan figures. At certain periods, it was said the water could b'e seen-tricling down the cheeks of these dim statues;, and hence this spring had received the *-name of ,The Wreepi g Angels." There were numerous Indian traditions in regard ,to it, and there were many indi-. cations that it had been a favorite place of resort for the' aborigines at the time that Goeryfirst visited it; and he ' thhought it probable that it was a roving company of these v savages that had murdered the Gault Family for trespassing on ground regarded by tlem as sacred., But the savages were .now little to be feared; and the more he saw of the place, the more confirmed he was in his intention to make it lis home. Robert-Gomery had an eye for the picturesque and roman- tic, and this spring had a peculiar charm for him. He ima- gined the days when, in the summer-time, he and-his beloved Huldah would sit inthe cool grotto; and then his practical mind was directed to the consideration of its usefulness to the farm, and especially to .the dairy, which in turn should furnish forth many firkins of golden ,butter and many cash- producing cheeses for the markets of the sea-ports. The wa- ter that fell from the arched .roof, or trickled down from the cheeks of." The Weeping Angels," falling into the pool be- low, kept ,it alva ys full, .and,- overflowing it, then stole back into the side of-the hill,.again to re-appear a few yards dis- tant, and fonm. a little pond, as if Nature had intended it for a drinking fountain .for man and beast. Theplacecombined so completely the beautiful with the useful, that ;it was calcu lated of a sultry evening equally to please .young lovers and tired laborers. e When .the -darkess closed about the place, Robert Gom-  A FAMLY HSTORY.         15 Y cry entered the house, and, taking a tinder-b)x from his pocket, soon had a fire blazing brightly upon the hearth. He next tpok his bread and hamfrom, his pocket, and began eat- ing his frugal supper. Often before, it had been his lot to sup on nothing save the hope of future freedom, which, though good in its way, was less substantial than the johnny- cake' and ham that had been furnished  him by good Mrs. Fisher, and which he now thought was sumptuous faPre. The fire on the hearth lighted up the solitary room; and he dis- tinctly saw the charred spots on the floor that had been made by the funeral pyre of the unfortunate Mrs. Gault. A little farther, a dark spot revealed but too plainly that there the blood of the unhappy woman had settled ia a pool, and coagulated and dried; for the scales of it were yet clearly A visible. Thus sitting alone, he mused over the strange revelation which he had heard, and soon found himself getting nervous and excited. "Faith," said he, "it I don't go to sleep, and quit thinking of these people, I shall conjure up their ghosts in spite of themselves or me either." So, going out, and find- ing some fragments of undecayed logsj he built a rousing fire, and laid himself down' to sleep in the back part of the room. He had not lain there long before it occurred to him that his :head was exactly over the spot where had stood the pool of blood. Though ashamed of his weakness, but more sur- prised than aslamed, for he had often before this "sank, overpowered and weary, to sleep" on the field of battle, where the blood of the wounded was clotted beneath him, and ori all sides friend and foe were lying in their last sleep, -he moved from this position, and Ijook up another; and was just dropping off into the oblivioiusness of sleep, and :his mind was fast losing its grasp on earthly affairs, whepn he fan- cied some object passed between him and the ;fire. He opened his eyes, and was sure he caught a glimpse of a child passing-out through the wall of the house, opposite the door. "Nonsense!" said he, to himself. " [What a goose I 'am to be disturbed in this way! I warrant I had seen nothing if that foolish fellow, Fisher, had not told me :is bughear stories." He then turned over his face to the wall, and his back to' the fire; and, resolutely shiutting his eyes, was soon .fast asleep.. He did not leave the house till nearly sunrise the next morning; and then, with his staff in his hand, he briskly , [            -    - -       - ( : *  /'  .!

To their curious questions he replied, that he had only had a strange dream, and that he had seen and heard things very much as others had described them.. But he in- sisted that it was only a, dream or rather ;that, in his sleep, he -had thought over the odd story of the day, which if he ad not,heard, he woul'td haveslept as calmly and untroubled as he had been wont to do when expecting a brush with the British the next morning at daylight. "Are you sure you were not awake all the while asked i Fisher     is-   No, I am not sure: -I thought I Gas broad awake, I con- fess. And yel I don't believe there ias been, a ghost on the earth since the witch of Endor quit s t in such high dudgeon: and, if anybody supposes I am to be thwarted in my pur- pose'by any stories of seared bovs or foolish old women, he may give up that notion at once; for I am resolved that I shall take: that place in spite of them." Fisher saw that his guest wasgetting nettled, and that it was useless to attempt to dissuade him from his purpose. The subject of the ghosts was therefore dropped; and, after a silence of a few minutes, Gomery asked him if he knew to whom the land belonged. It did belong," answedFiered Fisher, "to Col. Scranton of Boston. He was the original grantee of all this section. I bought my land of him. Whether Gault. ever paid him for it, I don't know; but it is probable he only had a bona for a deed, and that, as Gault was killed, the deed was never exe- cuted. Anybody knows Col. Scranton. He is one of the 'rich folks in Boston,and lives close by the State House." Being informed on this point, Gomery told his host, that, on his return to Dorchester, he should g right over to Bos- ton, and find Col. Scranton; and, if the place could be had for any reasonable price, he should certainly bargain for it. Fisher told him that he had no doubt it could be had very cheap; for nobody else wanted it, or would buy it at any price, e asked his hosts-a multiplicity of questions about what was required for pioneers in the forest; and he also toolk a bit of a walk, for the sake of exercise, as he said, to the house of one of Fisher's near neighbors, named Thomas Thorpe. He found Thorpe situated very much as Fisher   A   AMLY HSTORY.        17 ;       i was, -with a small clearing, and a family of half a dozen chil- dren, all boys. He talked with him about the country, its advantages and disadvantages; and informed him that he had resolved to settle on Gault'sMount, or Mount Gault as it was indifferently called. "The place is haunted,'" said Thorpe i "That don't frighten me." "But, if you had heard all the stories about t that I have, yoa would never go by there in the dark. I have had my share of bear and wolf fights; am lame now from the hug of a black one: but I don't fancy fighting ghosts. I advise you \ to stop in the house one night before you conclude to settle there." Gomery told him he had done that already, and intended to do so many timesmore.  ;  ,And did you see nothing strange and marvellous?" Nothing to be afraid of."  "Well, w - shall be glad of you for a, neighbor; for we - have only two near neighbors,--Fisher, as you know, and Welch, who lives about twice as far in the other direction,-- say-ten miles by trail, and twelve by the road." Having thus made acquaintance  with Thorpe, and an- swered all the questions of his inquisitive wife as to his wife and family, Gomery returned to his old friend Asa Fisher's, and there passed the night, discoursing of the war, the peace, and the future, to which they looked forward hopefully; pic- turing to their minds the time when the forests should -be levelled, and green fields and comfortable farm-houses should dot tie landscape in every direction. The next morning, before daylight, good Mrs. Fisher was up and stirring; and, ere it was light enough to fairly see the road, the frugal breakfast of fried bacon and eggs, boilbd po- :tatoes, corn-bread, butter, and coffee made of parched peas, was despatched, and, Gomery was on his way back to Dor- chester with his heart light, his steps buoyant, and his knap- sack filled with the best that Mother Fisher's homely larder could supply. 2 Ij,      ,   1       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY:  CHAPTER II.

HULDAH GOMERY waited impatiently for the return of her husband; and it was not till the end of the twelfth day, just as the darkness was shutting down, that she recognized the music of his footstep upon the stair. Her heart leaped up ft the sound, and she sprang forward to open the door and greet him. "I thought you would be along to-night, said she: "I have felt so all day." "Ah! well, I am glad to- get back," said he while she was engaged unstrapping his knapsack. "I have had a long trudge to-day; and, if it had not been for getting home to- night, I would have made two days' work of to-day's jour- ney. I had such good news to tell you, I pushed on with all, my might." "I was sure you would bring good news: my father used to say, that I could always tell what was going to happen; that, if he heard me talking about'folks at a distance, he was sure to see them at our house very soon after, or else hear something about them that showed they were thinking about us. But how about the news? what is it? -But no: I won't hear a word of it till you have got your supper; and it will be ready in a jiffy. I knew you would come; and I have every thing ready. NowN you dear, goo soul, while you are washing'up, and changing your clothes, I will get the sup- per on the table." She then struck up, in a clear, ringing, happy voice, one of the rude war-ballads of the time, which she kept up till Robert came in from his sleeping-room, freshy attired, and ready for his supper. "Now," said Huldah, " take a good strong cup of tea first; then begin. There is nothing like tea'to make folks social." Robert took his tea; and, after drinking off his first cup, he proceeded to narrate the incidents of his journey,-much   i    A- FArTLY ISTOR8T,            19 more fully than they have been narrated to the reader; but it is to be taken for granted that Iuldah took more interest in the trifling details than will the most obliging and good- natured of my readers, and therefore many things not directly bearing on the current of this history are omitted. He de- scribed very minutely the country over which he had passed, and said he saw many beautiful and tempting spots, and was  urged by the settlers along his route to select places near them; and each one informed him that his immediate vicin- ity offered more inducements to the settler, and combined more advantages, than any other locality in all North 'Ameri- ca. "But I continued on," he said, "till one morning, early, my eyes rested on the loveliest spot I had everseen-; andI determined to make that my fuiture home.- But at -the house nearest to it they told me it was a haunted spot." "What! haunted?"  "Indeed, they said so, and they believed it; and they said, too, that it was because it was haunted that nobody had ever settled there since the first settlers were mu- dered." "Murdered?" "Yes: the family that first took up the place werekilled, in . time of the war, by a company of English and In'dians that passed through that way; and the people in the:neigh- borhood say the place has been haunted ever since." "Well, I   never heard of a ghost that troubled a quiet conscience, and all the hobgoblin stories ever invented will not frighten me." '"But hear what the story is, and listen to my own experi- ence, and perhaps you will not be so incredulous." Huldah remained silent, slowly eating her supper, while Robert proceeded to narrate, to its .minutest details, all that he had heard from Fisher and Thorpe: and he did not with- hold the fact, either, that-he had had a very strange dream, so like reality that he could not see the difference; or else-he had seen unreal figures or, in plain language, ghosts, wander- ing about the house while he was staying in it.  "I warrant you," said she, "they are hionest ghosts, and will do no harm to honest people. At any rate, in m"ymind, they are no Objection to the plaCe;-and the So6ner 'wei maAke sure 'Rof it,' the better."  The next day, therefore,' Robert w ent into Bost6n to hant   20       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY:      ,  up Col. Scranton, and see if he could make a bargain with him for the land on Gault's Hill. Huldah, in thy mean While, busied herself in getting ready for a removal into the wilderness. The labor of preparation for the journey was not much, as their house contained barely the necessaries for housekeeping. They were in that blissful state that poor people are often in, -being free to move with slight inconve- nience; whereas the rich often find their possessions to be only as clogs and fetters, thit keep them as prisoners bound to places they would gladly leave. The original Tantalus was probably only a rich man whose great wealth bound him to one spot; and being bothered to death with agents and ser- vants, to say nothing of the sharks of the law and others who were trying to get .his thrifty earnings'away from him, he could enjoy nothing; and so some illiterate booby of a painter who could not read or write, and therefore could not represent his character in words, resorted to the clumsy de- vice of painting him as chained to a rock, with tempting things always before his, eyes, but which, though always starving to death, he could never touch. To find the house of Col. Scranton in Boston was not a difficult matter; and Robert Gomery found himself face to face with that benevolent and wealthy old gentleman about nine o'clock in the morning. He asked him if le was not the owner of a piece of land, away back in the woods, that a man by the name of, Gault had once settled on. '"I did own it once," was the reply, " and I suppose it is mine now; but I have pretty much-forgotten all about it. I have a whole: township up there, all but a few small farms I have sold;- and, whether I have a right to sell that tract or Inot, there, are other places just as good that I will sell very I cheap to honest, industrious settlers." "But I have taken a fancy to that particular lot," said Roberts "and, as nobody is- occupying it, I presume it is for sale, if ILcould only find the owner." "The fact is, it is legally mine," said Scranton; " at least, I think so. Gault was a young, enterprising fellow, and he had a lovely wife ; and I gave him a bond: of this kind: He was to go and settle there; and at the end of four years, if he cleared up thirty acres, he was to have a- tract of- five hun- -dread on the payment of fifty dollars. I wanted to get one settler in there; for I thought that would induce others to *      , -iv ' .  '  '   I ig .

He-sent me the money, however, before two years: and I told him when I was up there with my surveyor, just afterwards, he could have the deed as soon as he liked; and, after I got home, I had it made out for him. But the poor fellow never came for it. I -never could hear any thing of his children, though I inquired very particularly for them. I went up there after the massacre; but there was no trace of them: and probably -they both were carried away, and died under the cruel treat- ment of the savages. If either one of them is alive, it prop- erly belongs to him; but still it can do them no good, if they ever should appear, to have it remain as it is. The fifty dol- lars I put into a bank, to remain at interest till called for by the heirs of Gault: and, if I sell the-place again, I shall put the money I get for it with that; and, if it is not called for in fifty years, I shall direct to give it to some charity." "You can give a complete title'?"  "A warranty deed." G"hat are your terms for the same tract you sold to Gault?" "I ought to have not less than two hundred and fifty dol- lars. I have offered it for that, and I suppose I must let you have it for the same. I think it is the prettiest site I eyvr ,saw; and, if I were not so old, I would keep it, and have a house built for myself, only I would not like the associa- tions.          '  "Oh! you have seen the ghosts, then?" "Ghosts? Nonsense!" "But they all say up there that the place is haunted." "Then what do you want with it?" "I am not afraid of ghosts."  - "Then it will be worth no less to you on that account." ft "But I  am a poor man, and am unwilling to pay more than you could get from another person. You admit that the as sociations of the place are not agreeable to you, or else you wouldkeep it.

"Did you see anyof those spirits when you were up there?" Well, I confess I din't have a very quiet night; and, though we staid about he place for a week, none of us ever slept in the house after the first night. But let us drop the subject.

'  ' * rThough REobert had set forth on his first joLrey early in the spring, and before the frost was out of the ground, yet, with all his despatch, the-season was well advanced before he was ready to set out for the second time, taking with him his household gods, - an expression supposed to mean cooking utensils. He was in great, haste to get to his new home in season to make a crop that year; and so, on his return the next day from Col. Scranton's with his deed, he and Huldah set to work alertly to get ready to depart. By" swapping around," trading off things they had, and could not carry with them, for those which they had not and must have, they were able, after paying the fifty dollars to Col. Scranton, to increase their stock; so that, in addition to the 'household utensils, and farm and forest tools indispensable in their new home, they had three milch cows, two horses, and The rays o the sun strueck brightly across the waters of The rays of the sun struck ..- ....

Many of their nieighbors. were out, early as it was, to witness their depart- ure, and bid: them Good speed. On one of the horses rode Huldah, looking fresh and hopeful, her cheeks red as the roses by the wayside that were lifting their heads brightly towards the sky. But though her courage was high, and her heart brave, yet her eyes were moist, as, without lifting them to those around her (for she knew they would overflow if she did), she turned her horse's head towards the road, and faintly saying " Good-by!" and "God bless you!" she took her way along the road, and, with her husband, commenced the long journey. She looked beautiful, although she did not ride forth like a princess, her steed richly caparisoned, - prancing and champing to be galloping over the road. Her horse was a stout, slow, honest farm-horse, his back rounded like a rainbow; and, in addition to herself, he bore a good quantity of wearing apparel, stuffed into bags, that hung, like John Gilpin's. iwine-bottles, across the animal's back, behind the saddle. The other horse was loaded down with farm-tools, pots, pans, kettles, books, and an infinite va- riety of things necessary and convenient. Robert walked in front, driving the cows and sheep before him, which at first gave him trouble, as the latter were wild and shy,and--the former were ever for running back to the yard where their young were left with their last breakfast to be derived from the nmaternal source, or "Nature's fount." Indeed, they had   -all had their last breakfast of any kind; for the butcher was 6i  already in the yard with them, ready to take them to the I  slaughter-house, and there convert them into young beef. I  But sheep and cattle both soon gottamed andltired; and, nafter causing Robert a little extra running, they settled down - into a steady jog, and left him to walk quietly beside his wife, and talk of what they had left, and what they anticipated in the fiuture. They anticipated a long life of contented toil, and wished no other lot than what seemed before them; and, from morning till night, they planned and talked of what and how they would do in their new home; and, trusting only to themselves and the good Being above, they had litt!e anxiety, and less fear. Hope gave a rosy glow to all they saw-.      ,.      . - ,aw;            , '  ' ',   24      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: They timed their journey so as to stop at night at the same houses where Robert had made acquaintances on his previous journey, and at every place were expected and welcomed. It was ten days before they reached the log-cabin of Asa Fisher. They could hardly have been greeted more heartily had they been life-long acquaintances: and the good wife, Ruth, declared that it was , the most unfortunate thing in the world they hadn't come any other day, for she was ashamed to say she had nothing in the house fit to eat;" though, in truth, she had, in anticipation of their coming, cooked up provisions enough to last her guests and her own family for a week. But such is the way with many well- meaning persons. They lie out of sheer good-nature and politeness. But Huldah told her not to be uneasy; that, for her part, she expected to rough it, and should be content with a crust and a cup of water. "We haven't come to that yet, here," said Ruth, a little piqued that she had been believed. "Pray, then, let me assist you," said Huldah. "It is so long since I have done any thing, I should be delighted to help you." And with that the two women went into the back part of the room, and fell to work, and conversation on the science of housekeeping; leaving Robert and Asa by the fire to discuss matters of more dignity, if not more inmportance. It was not long, however, before Ruth alluded to the sub- ject that most concerned her on her friend's account, and asked her if She was not afraid of the ghosts up there on the hill.  "I am afraid of nothing," said she, " so long as I keep a clear conscience." "You have more courage than I have, then; for I wouldn't live on Gault's Hill for ten thousand dollars. And none of the neighbors wouldn't neither."  The ghosts, then, have done us a good service; for, had it not been for them, the place had been taken up long before we had se,en it. When I see 'em, I will give 'em my thanks and Robert's too." "Are you, then, such heathen?" said Ruth, dropping the subject, which was not again alluded to that evening. The news of the ratification of the peace, and the important events that followed the war, were the subjects on which the   V".

She was impatient to get to the hill, and so h"-iied up    the ireakfas that it was despatched a good halfhour beo a for sunrise. Robert had, in the mean while, attended to the a drS0mb animals and, as the first rays of the morning sun lit upon the sid of Gault's Hil sIt gave it a-look as beautiftul d. inviting as when it first caught and charmed his eye. ffudahl was impatient to get to a spot so lovely; and bidding her kind friend Ruth good-by, after having made her promise "to comne and see her in her new home as soon as she got things to rigrhts, she jumped upon the back oef old Rainbow, and whipped him along the trail. Asa Fisher took his axe A pon his shoulder, and said he would go with them upto the miry, and lend a hand for the day i getting the place in "Don't stay in thait wicked house over night," said his wife anxliously.              - a "Now fear of that," repied Asa. "More fear than danger, I  guess," said Robert, starting -forward, abetn trivring the cattle that had been browsing near for the past few minutes. Ashe  pp  hed  the house and clea ing, Fisher called Gomerys attention to a  larng tree that stood alone in the opening hav-ng been left as a shade-tree by Gault when all its fellows fell before his resounding axe. It stood about half way between the spring and  the house.   "That is called the Gault Tree," said Fisher; " and its leaves chanoe their color a nonth. earlier than any other tree in the forest. Some say the change takes place on the anniversary-night of the murder. It is called the Gault Tree; and some folks call the place the Gault-tree Hill or Forest, though we call it Mount Gault." "Probably, when the   ghosts come, they heat their cal- drons ufnder that tree," said Gomery; and that changes the "You   will see," said Fisher, not at all pleased at the scep- tical way in which Gomery treated all allusion to the ghosts. That day saw a wondeiful revolutionon Mount Gault -   26    .  GOMEBY OE MONTGOMERY: Robelrt and Asa made their axes ring in clearing up brush, cutting wood, and building a yard for the cattle, repairing the house, and redeeming firm waste and ruin the premises that had been going to decay ever since the night of the Gault murder. Nor was Huldah less busy. She had not been an hour in the house before a brisk fire was on the hearth; and over it was set the brass kettle, filled with water from the spring; and, with a: scrubbing-brush of hemlock'twigs made by Robert for the occasion, she was scouring the' floor, and ob- literating the signs of the dark deed the room had once wit- nessed. But there was one spot, that, though she scrubbed it long, would still lodk black. She scoured it with hot l water and with cold water, with. ashes and with sand, but all in vain; and she remarked to her husband and Fisher, that g she did not see why she could not get that spot clean, for it seemed as if all-the water of the spring could never wash it white. They knew what had once been there, and glanced, significantly at each other.    , '"Probably it's the ghost's doings," said Robert; at which Fisher shuddered sot that both he and his wife broke into a broad laugh.  "You may laugh to-day," said he; "but we will see :who laughs to-morrow. But it is getting towards sundown, and I must be going home. I wish- you a pleasant night of it; but I am sure you won't have it, and will want to change your lot, even if you lose all the money you have paid.?' "Oh! never fear," said Huldah: " if you Fill cast your eyes this way early in the morning, you will see the smoke rising quietly above the house, and you may take that as a sign that all is right.'" "I hope it may be so," said he, still doubting; "but good- evening. If any thing happens, it can't be said Asa Fisher has not done his duty, and given fair warning." So saying, he shouldered his axe, and trudged away. During the day, aigreat change had taken place in the ap- pearance of the, premises; for, i stead of looking cheerless and deserted, they had an air of neatness and comfort. Robert and Asa had manufactured various rude articles of house-furniture, that, if not elegant, were none the less useful. From a bit of board that had escaped the fiuneral pyre they made a small table; and, by rifting the cut log of a still   A FAMTTY HSTORY.        27 undecayed oak, they made some rough benches, that served in the absence of chairs, for seats. Outside, there had been a great clearing-up of underbrush and rubbish, and every had given her husband, on setting out in the morning, a meal-bag to carry on his shoulder, in which she had put a couple of loaves of brown rye and corn bread, with a roll of her own golden butter and a small cheese. Upon this store, with the milk drawn from the cows, they made a luxurious repast of bread and milk; and then, when the evening closed in, they made their bed for the first night upon the foor. The day had been a happy one, and Huldah often spoke of it in after-years as the happiest of her whole life. When all the other duties of the day were concluded, Robert took the old Bible that his father, was accustomed to read when he was a small boy; and, having read a portion by the light of the dim fire, the two united to return thankls to the Giver of all good gifts; and, in their excess, of joy and thankfulness, the tears of gratitude welled up from their hearts, and over- flowed.  , I   i .This couple, sh innocent of wrong tQ any human being, of I  faith so indoubting in the Supreme Ruler of the universe, g how could they have any fear of ghosts? It is only sceptics who fear such incorporeal wanderers, or the guilty who feel that they deserve to be punished. But the clear conscience and the unhesitating faith in a just and wise Ruler, fear nothing from those spirits that walk abroad in the dark. A fear of such visitants implies either a bad conscience- or a defective faith. Believe you that a God of love and Justice rules the earth? Then why, if guilt is not on your soul, fear to meet the spirits of the dead? Is not God over all, and governing all? and will you blaspheme him by doubting his omnipotence, and dreading lest he shall not protect you from the power of those whom he allows to revisit the earth from the other world? God is good, and he rules everywhere. He is everywhere. :Believe this; and, if you have no guilt on your conscience, you will never fear that he will sendlin- orpor eal beings to torment you. Robert  rGomery had no fear of ghosts; neither had his wife Huldah: and so, in spite of all they had heard, after the labors and duties of the day were  over.: they betoolk themselves to their hard couch; and s oon fellasleep . They                     .  .   28       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: had thought it not unlikely that they would see strange sights before morning, and had some curiosity to witness the singular apparition that report said had so long haunted the :place; but, further than that, they neither knew nor cared whether they saw or heard any thing of it. They had :slept, they knew not how long, when both of' them opened their eyes on a scene exactly as it, had been several times described to them. A beautiful woman, par- tially disrobed, with a sweet witching smile; her dress half open in front, revealing a neck and bust of marvellous beauty; her eyes cast wit} a look -of unspeakable love on an object ,near her,--was siting, clearly, distinctly, as in real life and in the broad 'da upon one corner of the hearth. She was holding in her hana a child's night-gown; and oppo- site, at the other corner, sat a man of rugged, manly appear- ance, in his stocking-feet, holding a large book, apparently a Bible, on his lap. His eyes, too, were resting on a figure that was directly in fiont of the fire-place and between the other two. This was the figure, of a little girl, as if ap- proaching, half reluctant, from its father to its mother; and with its face averted from the fire, casting back an arch look, over her shoulder to the good man, who, with a smile, was admonishing her,to bed. The face of the child seemed to be strangely lit up; for it appeared to have a brightness of its own that revealed every feature, though ayerted from the light of the fire. This sin- gular'scene lasted but a moment, and was succeeded by in-. ' stant and total: darkness. Directly they heard the noise of fire-arms outside, and then the shriek and struggling screams of a woman, and, above all, the piercing cries of a child. Robert and Huldah lay breathlessly silent until the sounds all died away. The last they heard was the screaming, shribking voice of the child, that grew weaker and fainter until'it ceased altogether. As these sounds were dying away, they seemed to dimly see the face of the woman, with a sweet, forgiving smile on her features, stretched, not upon the floor, but, as it were, suspended in the air. Her neck, so white and beautiful as she sat on the hearth, was now slashed from ear to. ear. Her eyes were wide open; and, though there was an expression of anguish on the face,'it was strangely blended with a smile of joy, as if the soul, in its transition from earth to heaven, had felt    Ii            A FAMLY -HSTORY.         29 :   the glow of the divine effluence, and impressed, the mortal form with something of its angelic beauty ere it winged its way towards heaven. Neitheri spoke nor moved till all was still; and then Robert said, "Huldah, did you see it?" "Indeed I did."  "Then it was not a dream?" "Dream! no: that child or somebody else that saw that awful deed is alive, -and its mind cannot rest; but every  night it leaves its body, and comes back; and it conjures up the same sight again so clearly, that all who are near can see it." '  "' Why, Iuldah, how knowledgeable you talk! How did i  you learn about these strange things?" "When I was at service in Dr. Parkinson's-family, I read in the papers all about what Dr. Franklin said on-the sub- ject to those Frenchmen that thought they knew more than , he did. And then Dr. Parkinson was always- reading'and talking about them; and, after my work Was done at night, I used to get some of his big books, and read all about it too. I made up my mind on the matter then." "Then they are not ghosts?" "Ghosts!-fiddlesticks! No. The mind of one person of strong will,--and that makes me think it is not the girl; alack, it is the man that did it! -I say, the mind of one per- son is so strongly impressed with that, sight, that it im- presses others; and I'll make you a bet of a boiled apple ,dumpling (only we've no apples) that the-man who did that terrible deed is now  alive, and sees the same sight every night. His strong will and vivid imagination impresses all other minds that happen to be in this house. To him that sight is a reality. He sees it, and it is just as it often is in dreams: we hear fiequently that people dream   of what is going on at a distance, and they find their dreams come true. The way of that is, that somebody else -sees in reality what they see in their dreams; and -there is a kind of electricity of mind, like that Dr. Franklin discovered with his kite, that passes from one brain to another, so that the thoughts of one person often are the thoughts of another person far away." "Well, you may be right, Huldah. I never thought of the subject before. I only took it for granted that all these i a s                '    30       GO, ERY OF MONTGOMERY:: ;stories of ghosts and appritions were all lies and nonsense.

' i .   ,  1 "Stung with the thoughts of home,  The thoughts of home rush on his nerves, And call their vigor forth."-- THOMSON. s    THE next morning, invigorated and fresh Robert and Hul- dah arose to their toil. They were not of the timid or ner- vous kind, to be troubled by any thing that their reason re- jected; and, though the dreadful sounds and disagreeable sights of the night before would often recur to them, they P  banished as much as possible such thoughts from their minds,    .and cheerfully pursued their labor, never alluding during the whole day to the subject. They applied themselves, with such willing hands to their work, that," ere' the hionth of May was'out, Robert had grubbed and burned over some four acres of the ground on which the trees had been just felled by Gault at the time of his murder. It was easier clearing up this part than that which had been partially burned over by its former owner; as on the latter had sprung up a thick growth of'blackberry-bushes, and young saplings. of maple and beech, that had got such root, that only by much labor could they be exterminated. On the other part, on the contrary, the small bushes had 4ardly  started; and the large trees of hard-wood had lain so long on the ground, that the trunks were decayed, and easily knocked to pieces; while the limbs lying light upon the ground, or standing forth to the air, were dry -and, crisp,. and were quickly licked up by the:flames that were sent to con- sume them. In the part before burned, there had also grown up among the bushes a thick undergrowth of fine grass, on which the cattle and horses fed eagerly, at the same time that they killed out the troublesome bushes. On the part recently burnt over, Robert planted a patch with Indian corn and potatoes, and also sowed a half-acre with spring rye, A spot near the house, which -had evidently }  * 1 1  * * ' ,  '    , 31   32  -     GOMERY OF MfONTGOMERY* been devoted by his predecessor to the- same purpose, he se- lected for a garden, and planted it with the seeds of turnips,  cabbages, beets, carrots, pease, and beans, sufficient to supply the wants of a family no' larger than his was at that time. It might increase; so might -the garden. Every night, it is true, they saw the apparition; but, a; it did not hurt them,  they paid little heed to it. They resolutely closed their eyes against the frightful sight of the murdered woman; and after a short time they divided off the house, and had their bed in the back room, so that they were cut off from that dreadful view. They still heard the noises as before, however; and, as before, saw the'light that streamed bright and vivid through r the crevices of the partition, and through the door-way whenever left open or ajar. Huldah was confident that her explanation of the phenomena was correct; and, as sle and her husband never alluded to the subject by word,-of course there was no disagreement between them. For a long time, as the ghosts did not trouble them, they did not care to trouble the ghosts; but at length Robert took it into his head that he would cultivate an acquaintance. with them. His wife endeavored to dissuade him; but he was bent upon it: and, so one night, just as the first light flashed into the house, he jumped from his bed, and, looking through the dooir saw the same three figures as before. "Well, my friends," said he, and was going on to say,." What do you want here?" but the-first words were scarce out of his mouth, when all was darkness, so suddenly-that he started, and, from some cause he could not explain, he fell sideways to the floor, his head strik- ing a jagged corner of a bench, which cut a large gash from the ear across the cheek to the right eye. He heard no more'that night; but his wife told him, that instead of a few musket-shots, as on ordinary occasions, there was a gound - as of a terrific cannonade as loud as the heaviest thunder-storm. It had no terrors for her, however; for, when Robert came to himself, he found his wife calmly bending over him, and washing the blood from his wounds. When, his consciousness was fully restored, and he realized where he was, Huldah, for the first time in her life, spoke to him in a fretful, querulous tone. t      ' "I told you not to trouble the ghosts. But you wouldn't hearken to me; and -now see what you have come to! Don't we know they are our friends? Didn't we get the land for  *",   X'i!           A FAMLY HSTORY. 3- a    a quarter of its value because of them? Anrd is this the re- turn you would make, you goose? Have ghosts no rights?" Of course, they have rights; but you say they are not ... ghosts. If they are not ghosts, but only the forms conjured (;z up by the wicked murderer, how could they knock me down, I would, lilke to know?" X??    "If they were 'ghosts, how could' they do it? for ghosts are nothing but shadows, and haven't the weight of a feather, nor the strength of a fly. And, besides, I don't think any thing touched you. You knew you were meddling in what was none of your business, and so had neither courage noi strength: so, when the light disappeared so suddenly, you started, made a misstep, stumbled, and fell sprawling, cut ' ting your head against that broken corner of the meal-chest, jI j  and rightly served you were too."' Robert made no reply to this; but having washed his wound   O till the blood, had nearly ceased to fow, his forgiving wife bandaged up 'his head, and the two lay down to sleep till j   daylight should summon them to their daily duties;    The next day they pursued their avocati bns as usual, and without a word of the incidents of the night. - The wound I:   on-Robert's face ws -not deep, and soon healed; but it left    a scar that was to le seen when he lay in his coffin.- When-    ever his neighbors asked 4him the cause of it, he always an- swered, "The ghosts." The next night, however, no apparition was seen; which was accounted for on the supposition that they had slept so soundly, that it had failed to awaken'them. So uniformly had it appeared before then, that it did not occur to them - as possible that it was not present as usual. But as they / saw nothing of it for a week, and were sure of having been ; awake at the hour when it had been wont to appear, they concluded it had left them, and, they hoped,forever. It matters little how sceptical people are: they are pleased with signs and portents reputed favo able, no matter how absurd they may be. "'Even the sight of the new mootn over the right shoulder is more pleasing to the veriest disbeliever in lunar influences, or foreshadowings of the future, than the same crescent seen first witl the sinister eye. After a few nights, however, it began to appear again,- sometimes faint and indistinct, and at others bright and lu- minous. But it was irregular, in its habits; now  coming   84       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: X  every night for a week, then not showing itself for as long a timei and again appiearing at such intervals as seemed to please its capricious temper.      /    '  ' Their neighbors, from the first, were very curious to know their experience with these -incorporeal beings; but the only answer they gave to the question, if they ever saw any ghosts, was, "None to speak of;" or "None to hfrt." Their neighbors increased very rapidly around them; for it was aufine region of country:- and, after the war, great num- bers pushed back into the interior; and at the end of a year, instead - of having only two neighbors within a dozen miles of them, they had no less than twenty. They all knew the strange story of the ghosts; and also the former history of Gault's Hill, or Gomery Hill as it was sometimes called. As a general rule, however, these early settlers had difficul- ties and troubles enough of their7 own, and so paid little attention 'to those of their neighbors. Some Scotch emi- grants, however, who had recently come from that'country where ghosts, witches, hobgoblins, and special providences, were, according to many authentic writers, known to abound, were not disposed to let our friends off so easilyl That Rob- i ert Gomery and his wife lived in that-haunted house, pros- pered, and did not fear the ghosts, was conclusive evidence that they were in league with the Devil. There were also some others of a similar opinion, honest people and industri- ous, but having the most gloomy religious, ideas; being lineal descendants of those zealous bigots of which Cotton Mather was a bright and shining light. These thought something should be done; but, as there was no law by which they might interfere, they only counselled together, and consid- ered what' course ought to be taken. They even spoke to Asa Fisher, and admonished him to beware of the Gomery Family; for they surely were in league with the Prince of Evil, and no good would come to him or his if he did not abjure their friendship. But Asa answered them very shortly: "What -do yop know against Robert Gomery?" "Oh! we know nothing against him, except that it is known he has dealings with the Devil," said 'one of his Scotch neigh- bors, who, with one of the native-born bigots, had called to admonish him. "; We believe he is an agent of the Devil, , and that he will have his part with the wicked, where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."  j   i! g        A FAMLY HSTORY.         35 "I Am sorry for him if that is so," said Asa. "It is the Lord's will, and'it is marvellous in our eyes. The wicked shall not go unpunished." ' X -;:  "How do you know it is so?" H/'   "Why, man, it is in the Scripter." "Why! there are, various opinions about what the Bible contains. I have read it and read it, till I almost know it by :/i  heart; and I have observed that people make up their mind j i  what ought to be in it, and then find it there. Now, you de- ?!  sire that the most of your fellow-creatures should be sent to j:   endless torment."              ' "It, is no such thing. I pray every night that they may all be converted." X    "r And think as you do?" ?    "And think as I do, of course'; for mine is th? doctrine di   of the Holy Scripter."          -  "And those that differ from you?"    , "And, had you the power, would you save them from so    dreadful a fate?"  j     's4"Let the Lord's will be done; and, if he dooms such un- believers to perdition, shall I not glorify his name?"

(' But do you call yourself wiser or better than your Crea- tor?" "I should blaspheme to do it."  "Then you admit you would do as you believe he-does.

Now, I don't believe i  - you are; and I am very slow to trust men that think so of themselves. They think that other men must go to hell be- cause they desire it. Their creed is an index of their minds. They would torture men in this life for not agreeing with them; and, when they find they c  n't do-that, they cinsole themselves with believing that they are to be miserable for- ever in the next.".   36       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: "Brother McPherson, I think we had better go: there is no hope of such a godless sinner as this." - There wouldn't be, I confess," said Fisher, " if my future state was to be left to the mercy of such merciless zealots as you are. But it is not, the Lord be praised!" With this last expression, the door of Fisher's house closed on his visitors, who, as soon as they got into the street, be- gan between themselves.   "Brother Catlin, I am sorry I ever left Scotland, if such abominable doctrines, are allowed." "I own it is great shame, Brother McPherson; but what can we do? The people, generally, have got it, into their heads that there must be entire religious toleration; and, un- fortunately, the people rule." "It is much better in Scotland. There, if a man is an unbeliever, we contrive to ruin him; ;and he hardly knows how it:is done. There it is represented as the Lord's do- ings, and has a blessed influence in discouraging non-con- formists and infidels. Bllt here we have no remedy. It is too dangerous trying to destroy their property. We can X only wait, and pray that ho mercy may be shown them be-  yond the grave; and you know the prayers of the righteous avail much."  T"rhere is no escape for such as this man Fisher, and Gomery too. They may be good men in their way--may i be honest, industrious, and moral; but works are nothing: and they are as sure to have the fate of Dives as we are to have that of Lazarus. And, I am/sure, I feel such an abhor- rence of their wicked scepticism and unbelief, that, were I in heaven and they in hell, they would have to call a long time before they would get a drop of water from me." , Conversing- thus, Catlin and McPherson pursued their way to their respective homes; and the last words uttered by McPherson, as they parted, were, "We know that they will catch it hereafter, if they don't here." '"That is-our hope and consolation," said Catlin. But time wore on; and, in the changes that were talking place, people forgot to trouble themselves about the ghosts ' of Gault's Hill.'; Robert Gomery was a successful man, and prosperity makes friends. He was liberal and easy in his dealings, and an obliging neighbor; and, as his good will w4s -desired, even Brother -McPlher'son and Brother Catlin   A FAMLY HSTORY.         37 ceased to talk against him by hinting that he was in league with the Evil One. In fiact, he had no neighbors more willing than they to help out at a corn-husking, or spend- a social winter evening, after a sumptuous supperi succeeded by lib- eral potations of hot rum-toddy. But they never would stay till the hour when it was said that the ghosts ap- peared.  Though Gomery had got possession of a large tract of the best land in the country, and had a goodly space cleared, and was prospering beyond his first expectations, he unex- pectedly found that his purchase was far more valuable than he had ever supposed. The boundaries of his land being sought, it was -found, that, to the north-east 'it extended not only, the whole breadth of the hill to the base, but about forty rods beyond, and took in that part of Salmon R iver that included the only available water-falls in its course for a distance of twenty miles. He was thus the owner of a valuable water-privilege sufficient to run all the mills that would be required in that vicinity for fifty years. He no sooner made this discovery than he resolved to profit 'by it; and, in a short time, he, had, a small saw-mill erected for the manufacture of boards and joists.  His neighbors were all greatly in need of lumber; and, as money was a very scarce commodity, they gave their labor will- ingly; and his. little mill was able to do enough to payfor all the labor that he could profitably employ. Taking ad- vantage of their necessities, so as to serve himself at the same time he benefited his neighbors, he built himself' a new house upon the hill, as a dwelling for his increasing family. A boy nhd a girl -had, in the course of these'happy and prosperous years, appeared to gladden ihis hearth,; and, i as his circumstances would justify it, he resolved that he would have a new, large, and commodious house 'for a dwelling, instead of the humble log-house that had been so famous for years as the scene of ghostly visits. The new house wasi a large square building, two stories high, and painted white. From its commanding position, it' could be seen at a great distance to the south and east;- and, as Gomery had become the most important man in the vicin- ity, the name of the hill was gradually changed from Mount Gault to Mount Gomery. The transition from this to Mont- gomery was natural and inevitable; and the village that 4            o   38 .     GOMERY OF, MONTGOMERY : grew up at the Falls, was, by general consent, at first called Montgomery's, and then Montgomery., Robert continued to live on the hill, however; and as the name "Gomery," though not common, had other claimants in the country, Robert Gomery came to be known, among all the people within a hundred miles of him, as Gomery of Montgomery. The new house was painted white, and loomed up so grandly, that it could be seen at a great distance; and Asa Fisher called it Gomery's Perch. The name ever after at- tached to the house, "The Perch," was well known far and near; and many a chance traveller who had there found hospitality and welcome remarked that it was rightly named, for it always offered a comfortable place in which to roost. After the new, house was' finished, and the family had moved into it, the old log structure was degraded to the humble service of a storehouse. ' It stood in the rear of the new house, and besides being a receptacle for farming tools, empty casks and boxes, and discarded or broken furniture, it was a' sort of rude Workshop, with a bench, and such car- penters tools as were required to make yokes and bows, wood-sleds, axle-trees, and such other utensils as economy ; and convenience required should be-made upon the place. After its desertion as a place to sleep in, it was not known how often the apparition, appeared. Occasionally, however, if any one happened to be stirring at the' "ghost's hour," as it was, called, the strange sights and sounds- were observed; though, oftener, the people who were moving about the premisesi at midnight observed nothing. It was not long after the first small saw-mill was built at what was now called Montgomery Village, before its profits, and the profits of the hill-farm, were sufficient to enable the proprietor to build another and larger mill,- -one that co ld saw not only boards, and joists but shingles and clapboards; and: the succeeding year he built a grist-mill with two run of stones, and the year after put, up a wool-carding machine and--fulling-mill. He was, indeed, a thriving man, and his prosperity made him- few enemies; for he had the sense to see that his neighbors' prosperity was his own. The land in the immediate vicinity of the village he sold out in alter- nate lots, at nominal prices, to sober and industrious me-. chunics:; knowing that, if a large town grew up, the part left to him would be worth more in a- few years than wouldl the whole if he acted the part of the dog in the manger. -o    * ,   A FA MLY HSTORY.         39: X     For all these changes, however, which we have noticed, a H:?, few years sufficed. Though. the country was fast filling up, yet it was mostly an uncultivated waste still. There were g  * many small clearings; but the openings' in the forest were, but as islands in the sea compared with the broad expanse of unbroken wilderness.  Robert Gomery had the, best house in all that section, the best farm, and the largest clearing; and yet between him and Asa Fisher's on the old road, or trail (a distance of four and a-half miles), there was - not another settler. The distance from the house on the Xt hill to the village, that lay in a different direction, was only i about half as far; and the only ca/rriage-road between the houses of the two pioneers was by way of the village, being - some two miles farther than by the old trail that Robert had first travelled when he ascended the hill.,  \   If Robert Gomery was somewhat inflated at his own suce cess; if, as he looked out from his own door and saw the - thriving village beneath his eye, and the beautiful country j   spread out before him, each year showing more signs of g.   wealth and cultivation, he looked back, and thought of his earlv struggles, and his present independence; if he in- dulged in reveries of how he would be such a benefactor to all the people in his neighborhood, that, by, and' by, they hould Bend him to Congress, or elect him Governor, -- it was an ambition and a vanity not to be despised, but rather hon- oreed; for, in all'his plans and projects, his hope was to be WI  honored for the good he had done. His neighbors had reason to respect him, and he deserved - of them ',all' that he anticipated from them. He not only sold his own lots in" the village very cheap, but he bought i land in the vicinity for cash;, and sold it out, on long credit and at very low interest, to such settlers as he knew would be useful citizens. He,'never inquired into the politics or religion of any person who camei'to settle near Montgomery, and this caused more complaint against him than all other causes put together; for though he did not profess to belong to any sect, yet the members of each thought it his particu- lar duty to favor their own: they thought, that with his- wealth and influience, if he would encourage only settlers of their fai th, then, in a short time, they could overshadow the heretics. The immersionists thought that with  his aid they could drown  out the sprinklers; and the sprinklers thought   40       O0MERY OF MONTGOMERY : that with him td back them they could wither up the im- i mersio6nists. But he would not take sides; and then the rigidly righteous, the " unco gude," began to hint that he was no better than an infidel; but, when he heard of it, he said he did not think it necessary to persecute in order to prove that he swas a Christian. With this remark he quietly-pursued his way, and left- those more sectarian than he to fight it out among themselves. He had been now more than ten years on the place. His Wo - wrldly goods had increased wonderfully, and the world lay all sunshine before him.' He had, as we have said, two chil- dren, bothhealthy, robust, and promising. The elder was a boy; and in view of the fact, that, unlike his father, he had' been born under a fi'ee government, of an independent coun- try, he had been named Freeborn. He had made no claim to attention till his parents had been three years in the woods; and then he made his appearance,; and was gladly welcomed, notwithstanding the trouble he caused. A sister appeared two years later, who was named Eunice, as the name signified a glorious victory: so that, at the time to which we have now arrived, the boy was seven- and the girl. X five years old. The harvest had been gathered in, and the winter had shut down upon the earth with its thick quilt of snow. The earth had given forth abundantly; and Robert Gomery' found it necessary to go to Portland to attend to certain ' business there requiring his attention, and at the same time to take to market a load of farm-produce which he wanted to sell for such groceries and other necessaries as his family re- had been slaughtered the day before for this destination. The affectionate H-uldah had put up for him a large round box of luncheon, consisting of bread and butter, sausausages, cheese, doughnuts, and Thanksgiving mince-pies more liberal- ly stuffed with plums than was-the famous bag-pudding whose fragments were so economically used by the thrifty queen of good King Arthur. The children, though it was not three o'clock when he started, were up to see him off; and many commissions did they give him to execute for them in the purchase of toys and go]ies.' Freeborn had the day before secured the bladders of the slaughtered hogs; and, having in-   A FAMLY HSTORY.        41 flated them through a straw, he put them on top of the load, X    to be sold in payment for some new boots, a pair of skates, a X    fur cap, cloth for some new clothes, besides sundry other things which he desired should be bought for him. His ,tX  father objected to taking any more additional load, and said, XH   if the sleighing were not good for the whole distance, he X,   would be obliged to throw them off. ;t  ^It was a cold raw morning when he started; and the sleigh- ing was such, that he could go by the- old road, or Indian trail, -a way never travelled by carriages. This was a saving of a good bit of travel;, but as it Was seldom travelled now, except by travellers from a distance, Who' had no object in. going round by the village, it had never been madea high- gi"'5' way fit for Wheels t was a sort of road for travellers, on foot or on horseback, who were- passing through from the seacoast to the North; and Gormery of Montgomery's became known nfor a long distance as a resting-place by the way- side, where the rich and poor alike found an honest Yankee !t ' welcome, a bountiful repast, a warm bed, and no charge for the entertainment. I; '  The 'ground had been frozen solid before the snow had fallen; and, with the snow now on the ground, the sleighing was perfect. The crisp, eager air seemed to stimulate the stout horses; and Gomery fiisked over the road at a rate that surprised him. He had gone full twenty miles before he saw the first light in any house that he passed; and even this one was seen before the first gleam of dawn appeared in the east. Oh! it was glorious sleigh-ridig in those brave days of old, i   when the weather was cold, the snow not too deeu and the air clear and nipping; when th6re were only sleighs enougzh on the highways to make the roads smooth, and not enough I  to cut through into the sand and earth beneath. How fleetly the honest Morgans skimmned over the hills and along the valleys! and how merrily the great heavy bells jingled! How laughingly the hills echoed back their jocund sound ' Alast those days are gone; and now, if we would ride in a sleigh, it is to the: music of tea-table bells, and over roads where- the snoF clings tenaiously, but- vainly, for precedence With the sand and gravel.  As Robert Gomedy moved: sobriskly over the hills, lie in- dulged in many pleasing reveries, -now thinking df ti e 4*           42       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: honors that the people ere long would thrust upon him, and now imagining the expressions andt surprise of Freeborn and Eunice when he should produce b  tfore themlthe numer- ous toys and gimcracks that he intended purchasing for them. Certainly the latter picture was the more pleasant to con- tem'plate; sand the sweet home-thoughts soon drove his ambi- tious schemes quite out of his head, and he glided along sing- ing snatches of war-songs and "pennirial." hymns, mixing triem in sandwich fashion as they flew up from his merry heart to his trolling tongue. The sun at last showed his face, but so white and pale as if ashamed of himself for his weak- ness in allowing the winter to rule so absolutely in spite of him. When he first show'ed his head, the air was clear and transparent: but, as if in contempt of his, power, a haze soon began to overspread the earth; and by nine o'clock, though be could be seen in his place in the heavens, his appearance was rather that of a broad, bright shield, than as- th6 god of day. In a little while he could hardly be seen at all; and by eleven o'clock he was comnpletely obscured, and there was every appearance -of another snow-storm. But no snow fell that day; and it was not till-the next morning, athout nine o'clock, that one, of those storms set in, that, from the start, show that the gusty old gentlemen is in earnest. The flakes were fierce, round, and scattering at first, and the air sharp and biting. Gradually they grew larger, the sky darker, and the air softer; and, in a couple of hours, the snow was falling fast and furious, and rapidly filling up the road, so as to cause the load to drag heavily on the stout team. But Gomery of Montgomery still pushed on, and, before night of the-second day, had reached his. destination, sold his load, made his purchases, transacted all his other business, and was ready to return. In the morning, therefore, notwithstanding the storm still kept up, though at a more moderate rate, he de- termined to start for home, in spite of hard roads and stormy weather. Bad as the roads were, and deep as was the snow, he thought it would be easier getting along than after the storm had abated, and the inevitable nor'-wester set in. So he set forth, his load but little lighter than when he pame in; for, in exchange for his farm-produce, he hadl'aid in a supply of salt, sugar, tea, coffee, molasses, and other things wanted at homel not forgetting Freeborn's-skates, and various other trinkets iand -kickshaws.   '             *A FAMLY H"STORY.       43 iBut though he urged forward his horses through the day with unusual cuts of the whip, and walked beside the sleigh for -the most of the way, he found the darkness closing down upon him by the time he got to the Cross-roads Tavern, twenty miles from town. He therefore stopped for the night at the inn; and the next morning the storm had ceased, and the wind was blowingAhe snow wildly about, piling up large drifts in some places, and sweeping other long reaches bare as before the storm. Yet, nothing daunted, he set forth so' soon as he saw the farmers living on the road pass: by with their heavy ox-teams for the purpose of tramping down the snow, and making the roads passable for loads. The second night after leaving the Cross-roads Tavern, by hard driving, Gomery reached the house of his last neighbor on the direct or shortest road to his house. This was the house of his old friend Fisher; not a log-cabin as of yore, but a comfortable frame-house, lathed and plastered, shingled and clapboarded. Since the last storm, no one had passed over the old road by the Indian trail; and he could not think of pushing his jaded team that night over the longer route by the village. The last day had been very hard .on the horses, and it was only after much coaxing and whippig that he was able to reach Fisher's house. To Fishers offer, therefore, to put up his team  in his barn for the night, he willingly assented; but, to the invitation to stop himself he gave a flat refusal.             ' The night was stinging sharp. "The owl, for all his feath- ers, was a-cold." The cattle and horses stood curled and humped up in their stalls, and the air in the red west seemed to sparkle and shimmer with the frost. "It is a bitter night, neighbor,"'said Fisher. "The frost has not been so thick on the windows any night this winter. You had better stay, and   go round by the village in the morning.     At any rate, let us have supper, and then you will think better'of it.'"  But he even refused to partake of the ample supper now spread upon the board. " No, no! " said he. "There is a supper waiting for me at home, and anxious eyes are watching.   I warrant you there has not been a sound heard outside of the house for 'two nights but Freeborn     and  Eunice have  run to look  for me. They went crying to bed last night; and to-night there   "      .GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: will be older eyes than" theirs crying, if I don't get home." So throwing off his outside and heaviest overcoat, that it might not impede his walking, he prepared to sally forth. "You had better keep on your overcoat," said Fisher. "You will need it." U' I have got one on now; and I have no fear but'l I shall be warm enough, breaking my way throiugh the snow. Good- ilight r I will send one of the hired men early in the morn- ing for the team." tWith that he passed out, and took his way towards his home. Robert Gomery had not been mistaken in supposing that anxious eyes were on the-lookout for him. He had been gone a day beyond the alloted time; and the affectionate Ruldah was getting uneasy about him, though she well knew the deep snow must keep him back for a considerable time. The children were excessively impatient for his re- turn, and had gone reluctantly to bed for the last two nights. - This night, however, they -vere resolute to see him, and with many tears protested that they could hot sleep till he re- turned; and it was a fall hour beyond their usual time before their mother could persuade them to their beds by pronmises that they should be called when he came. EBut their strange anxiety imparted itself to her; and, for some reason (she could hardly tell why)?she became very nervous and anx- ious. Several times during the evening she required, the two farm-laborers to go out, and look, and listen for him. She supposed, of course, that he would come by way of the village, as the other road had not been broken out since the great storm. . It was past nine o'clock, and there were no signs of the good man. The voice of little Eunice was heard calling from her truckle-bed in the next room, saying she heard a noise outside. At that, one ,of the men, called Linus, went out again to - look. He soon returned, saying it was only the old Indian who was sleeping out in the old house. - Who is that old Indian I have seen about for the last two or three days? askedtHuldah. "I don't know who hie is, replied Linus. "Chesley and I were at work in the old house the day the storm begun. I was making a yoke, and Chesley was& making the bows, when \ the door oliened, and that awful-looking critter stood at -thue   +, "' A   77177lt l- 5 *              4    vT47 ^^'g  '   ] *  A FAMTT Y THSTORY.  -     4 door. He 'eared to be almost froze to death. He never . said a word, but came right in, and lay down by the fire like E     a dog. He shivered so, that I was a-feared he'd die; and Ches- ley came in, and got him a glass of hot grog. I guess he wanted a drink himself. The old fellow, when he see the grog, catched it, bilin' hot as it was, and swallowed it at 'a gulp; and-then'lay down, and went to sleep. "When he was asleep, we looked at him hard; and never in all my life did I see so pitiable an object. He was thin and black and hag- gard; and one leg had been broken and grown together, so that the heel of the right foot ppinted right into the hollow of the left.' When he waked up, Freeborn and Eunice were both out there, and he looked amazing curis at them. Jest then Chesley took off the big kettleful of potatoes biled for the hogs; and he snatched one of 'em right out of the kettle, land eat it down as if he was starved." "I think he is cold out there to-night," said -Chesley. "I asked him if he wasn't last night, and he said 'No;' but it is a great deal colder to-night.7 "Well, I wish you would go and get some of those old blankets and the old buffalo, and carry out to him," said Hul- dah. "It is a pity he should - suffer - when we have clothes enough."' Chesley did as he was requested; and, while he was away, Huldah spoke up again, and said, -  "Why did not you send into the house and get some good victuals, and not let him eat oily pigs' food ?" " That is just what I was coming at. When Freeborn see him catch at the potato so, he run into the house, and got a great plate of beef and pork and bread and cabbage and turnips,., and gave 'em to him; and he eat it all. We asked :   him a great many questions; but he would not answer a word." "I think that old Indian is crazy," said Chesley, coming in again after having taken out to him the bed-clothes as or- dered.  "Why,? what tantrums is he in now?" inquired Linus. "They are coming to-night," says he; "the angels are weeping;' and Isays, " Who is coming ? and what angels?" and at that he drew his finger across his throat, and laughed like a devil, and pointed his finger toward the spring. "Ah, well! 'tis some old Indian who has heard the stories that they used to tell about ghosts on this hill."  ".      - GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: "Oh, yes! he       said he had been here before," said Linus. "-First he would answer nothing. But. yesterday, when I took the rumbtottle out for me and Chesley to take some- thing, I gave him a swig. I put the bottle down in a corner, and he got hold of and drinkt it every drop. It was every drop there was in the house, and we sha'n't have any more till Mr. Gomery gets back. - Fort'nate, that'll'be soon. Well, after he had got all that rum down his neck, he began to mutter something; and I asked him if he was ever here be- fore. He -said, ' Yes.' How many years ago?' 'Fourteen.' ' Who lived here then? ' ' Gault,' said he. ' What!' says I; ' were you one of them Indians that murdered him?' He only said,' gh; ' and that might mean any thing or nothing. Fi- nally Chesley asked him -if he knew whether or no that child was dead or alive; and then he looked up, shook his head, and passed his finger across his throat, as much as to say how it had been killed. Then,he laughed, and looked so devilish, I should have thought he was the Devil himself, if he had- only had a split foot, instead of one turned wrong side out." At this time, the voice of Eunice was heard calling from her bed-room' for the second time. She had heard papa's voice; and PFreeborn said he had heard it too, and it was in the direction of the old trail. Again they all listened; and this time they went to the door, and. stood till the cold drove them in. They cast their eyes along the old road; but the snow lay deep, stiff, and hard, antd there was no sign of a track in that direction. Of course, he would not come that way : and so they strained their eyes and ears to catch some sign from the village road ; and Chesley walked down in that direction for -half a mile, and, seeing nothing of living beings, returned. 'Then they waited for a few minutes longer; when Freeborn came running out in his night-clothes, saying he knew he had heard his father calling; and he begged that he might' be dressed, and go and search for him. , Then all wehnt tof he door again, and looked. But no sound was heard; and though the sharp, biting air was so clear and cold, that the bright starlight, falling on the crisp snow, glittering back the diamond light' from its myriads of crystal particles, enabled them to peer far into the distance, yet no moving thing was to be seen. Eleven o'clock came; and, as nothing more was heard, they   A FAMTTY HSTORY. .       47 thought it useless to sit up later. The hired men were dis- missed to their rest; and Huldah, as usual, went- to look at ,her children before retiring for the night. Neither of them was asleep yet; but both were intently listening for the sounds which they said they had .again heard. Their mother was E uneasy, but, assuming a bold heart, told the children they must be mistaken, and, carefully tucking the clothes around them, bade them go to sleep. But she herself had hardly laid' her head upon her pillow, when she fancied she heard a sound as of some one hallooing; and at that instant the two children jumped up in their beds, saying they had heard it again. lHuldah arose again instantly, and, partially dressing herself, went to the chamber-door, and called out to the men to come down, and again go out and look; for she was sure she had heard some one calling outside.. Incredulous, yet good-natured, they both came down, and again went out into the cold, dark night. They walked sone distance down the road towards the village, and, as they were returning, saw a bright light gleanming from the window of the old house. "By George ! " said Linus, " I b'leve the old Indian has set the old ark a-fire." In an instant, however, it was dark as ever; and instantly-they heard a noise as of the discharge of fire-arms. "By hokey! I guess the devil is to pay to- night," said Chesley. "'That was nothing but the cracking of the ice on the river." "But we never hear the ice crack on the river way up here." " It is a very cold, still night; and it is possible." As they approached the old house, they saw the figure of the old Indian limping away, and in the same direction heard a strange noise. "Come back, old man!" said Chesley. " What are you going off now for?  You will freeze to death before morn- ing.7  But the old cripple limped away, answering never a word. to them; but still the sound kept up in that direction. "That is a queer noise for an old man," said Linus.  "It sounds more like a scared baby," answered Chesley. When they entered the house again, they asked Huldah if she had seen the light in the old house. "Certainly I did," she replied. "I have seen it  hun.  48       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: dred times before, though not once for I don't know how long." , "What is the cause of it?" asked Linus. "I don't know much about it," said she; and the men, con- fused and astonished, again went to their beds. '; Mind you," said Huldah, as a parting injunction, " get up early in the morning, .and one of you go down to the village, and see what that noise was about;" and with these last words she again retired, and fell asleep. The next morning, before the first gleam of daylight could be seen, Linus was up, and on his way to the village, for what he hardly kneW. It occurred to him that he was going on a foolishs errand,--one implying that Gomery of Montgomery did not know enough to take care of himself, and couldn't find his way home. But somehow he felt that something had gone wrong; and so he' pushed on at a quick trot, it being necessary to move briskly to keep from freezing. It was the coldest morning, he thought, he had ever known; and, by the time he reached the village, his'congealed breath had collected on his eyebrows, on his locks and whiskers, and on the up- turned collar of his coat, so that he looked like Winter per- sonified. There was but one store in Montgomery at this time, and this was the principal place of public resort. It was kept by a thrifty young speculating tradesman, named Springer; and he was just opening his place when Linus arrived. "Hallpo, Linus!" said, the shopman: "you are out early this morning. What has brought you here at this time o' day, such a' morning as this?" "The-rum jug gin out, for one thing." "What! hasn't Gomery got back yet?" ' No: hasn't he, got along this fur.?" anxiously inquired Linus. "This fur! That's a pretty question. It's likely he would stop here, ain't it?" Linus felt that he had come on a fool's errand, and so said he wanted a lsmall jug of New-England rum to last till the old man got home. With this, having first taken a warming draught to sustain him, he set forth on his way back to the Hill. H-uldah anxiously awaited hi; return, though really unexpec- tant of any good news. Freeborn and Eunice seemed to have forgotten their anxiety of the night before, and were   A FAMLY IIISTORY.        49 'i!J ?usily engaged in playing at hauling wood, with a chair for a ob-sled, and Eunice for oxen. She was Star and Buck, ineback and Golden, to the youthful teamster. Huldah, hen Linus returned with no tidings, was convinced that the; sounds she had heard were connected with the old tra- ditional sights:and cries that had ben" heard every night on the Hill for so long after the Gault murder; and, feeling easier, told the men to go about their work. That day an unusual number of the villagers was collected at the store of Job, Springer. Job always kept a good fire; and, as it was so cold that few people could face it by work- ing out of doors, many gathercd in there as a place where all had an equal right. They amused themselves by talking - over the meagre news of the day, telling stories, chewing and smoking tobacco, and occasionally indulging in a glass of rum. -It was about eleven o'clock, and the company were   discussing the cold weather; and various reasons were given for regarding the night before as the coldest ever known in that vicinity. One of the company, Tisdale Abbott,'gave as a proof of it, that some rum. he carried hoie the night be- fore was found frozen solid in the morning, and he had never had that happen to him before. "'No," said Job, who felt the strength bf his rum called in question: "I presume you never did, and for the good reason that you never kept any rum over night before." This caused a hearty laugh at Tisdale's expense, as he was known to be a man that never drank spirituous liquors of any kind.  The laugh was interrupted by the entrance of a stranger who had driven up to the doori who, having covered his horse with a bed-qcilt, entered the store to warm him- self externally by the fire, and internally with a glass of "black-strap."  He {'had previously stopped ,on his way at Asa F'isher's, and there learned that Gomery of Monltgomery had arrived there the night before, and left his team; going home on foot by the old road. This fact came out incident- ally as he was sipping his-glass of hot water, rum, and mo- lasses. "That couldn't be," said Springer; "for one of his men was here, and inquired for him early this morning." ' Yes: it was so; for I see his pung standin' at the door, full of things he had got down below."   50   '   GOMERY OF HONTGOMERY: "By, golly! then he's froze to death," said Abijah Kim- ball, jumping from his seat. Every man spranog up instantly at this exclamnation; for the probability of its truth flashed instantly on every mind,. There was little more said. Tisdale Abbott flew to his own house, and, taking his black mare -from the stable, har- nessed her with immense celerity, to the sleigh; and when his wife came out to the door, and saw him driving furiously away, she called out to know what the matter was. Tisdale imagined rather-than heard her question, and- screamed in reply, as he whizzed past the door, the tears rolling down his rough, honest cheeks, "Gomery of Montgomery is froze to death!"A quick switch or two across the flanks of his gamy little mare, and,'in a moment, he is back to the store. Two others of the company jump into the sleigh; and , the little mare is put into a canter that she is scarce allowed to break till she stopped, puffing and panting, at the door of Asa Fisher. The rest of the company followed on,--some in sleighs, and some on foot. No one felt the cold now; for, though they had started off without staying for overcoats or other extra protection from the cold, the news they had heard sent the blood coursing so livelily through their veins, that no idea of cold was suggested to them. Asa and his wife, and all his children, were at their mid- dlay meal when they saw the sleigh drive up; and, observing through the window the excited countenances of the pas- sengers, all hurried to the door, Asa calling out,- -, What, what, what's this?" "Was Go'nery of Montgomery here- last night'?" said Tis- dale, thouglih the well-known sleigh at the door rendered his question superfluous. "Yes: he left here last night at about eight o'clock to go home by the old road."         \ "He's froze to death!" These were all strong men, inured to, life in its roughest, rudest form; but there was not a dry eye among them. Fish- er's children broke out crying aloud, and his wife joined in the melancholy wail. -\ Asa put on his old cap and mittens, and told them to follow him. It was idle to tLink of going through the snow on the old road with a horse; and they set forth on foot, running and pushing by each other in their haste to get over the ground.   A FAMTY HSTORY.      ,  51 They were closely followed by others who had pursued hard after them from the village; and, by the time they had got a j    mile from Fishelr's, there were a dozen in the company. The track of Gomery was the only one in the road; and they followed it for about two miles, when they observed a place where he had apparently stopped, and leaned against a tree. ' After this the steps seemed irregular, and showed that he had stopped frequently. The pursuers, pushed on till they came to within less than: a mile from the house, and they could see the road for half a mile directly before, them, and there were no signs of him to be seen. They now began to hope that he had g0t through alive, and was at last safe at home; but 'just as they were making the: last turn that shut out the house from their view,oand the tall edifice loomed full on their sight before them, they passed an immense birch that stood close to the road. There the track came to an end; for sitting on the closely packed snow, on the upper side of the tree, was Gomerybof Montgomery, frozen to death. His eyes looked as clear and bright as ever; for they had doubtless been frozen in their sockets, as, with a spasmodic effort to throw -off the overpowering drowsiness, they opened to gaze on the light that beamed through the windows of  i his own. home.   52       GOMERY OF .MONTGO1MERY  i-  CHAPTER IV. "Whip' me, ye devils, , From the possession of this heavenly sight I  Blow me about in win4s I roast me in sulphur t Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liqfi'd fire I1' --OTiELLO. THE terrible death of Gomery of Montgomery caused the strange appearance, the mysteiious behavior, and the still more mysterious departure, of the old Indian to be, for a " time, unthought of. He had been mentioned at the break- fast-table the morning after his disappearance;, but as strag-. gling Indians were not rare, in those days, and were erratic and peculiar in their movements, he was dismissed as an od- dity, and not thought of again for a long time. There was sad wailing in the house, when, looking forth from the window, Huldah Gomery saw:a dozen ,men ap- proaching laboriously through the snow, bearing in their arms the stark-stiff body of her husband. The dead was buried in time; and save that the master's hand was .no more visible, and sorrow reigned instead of joy, every thing went on as regularly as before the fatal night. The Indian had been over- the same ground before. On that occasion, he was one of a party who had escaped from a sharp action inithe East between' a party of Arnold's men and a body of Indians, Canadians, and English, which, under a certain Col. Cumberland, an officer of highIrepute in his Britannic majestys'b service, had been surprised and cut to pieces, to the great mortification of the commanding officer. He had barely escaped alive with a dozen of his English vet- erans, together with aboutt thirty Indians, whom he had be- guiled with large promises of blankets, fire-water, and scalps, from their own hunting-grounds farther west. 'Col. Cum- berland not only stood high as an officer of enterprise and daring, but he wrs a scion of one of the blood aristocracy. The name of his ancestor was to be found in Domesday Book; and the family history was checkered by many acts of cour- age and loyalty. He Wal a man of excessive pride, and of i  * .  *  ' * i     '     -'   A FAlMLY HSTORY.         53 boundless ambition. He had not only an unbending will, but a will that never bent. Like all men, he could be con- quered or killed; but in his will and purpose he never gave way: his temperament and education alike forbade it. And !   yet, for all this, he had been surprised by a company of rag- fged, shoeless, Yankee recruits, and his force destroyed; and I   he was now making his way back to meet his superior, and Ad   report his own defeat. His contempt for the Yankees was now changed into inveterate, unquenchable, remorseless hate. He could never know them more but as vermin, deserving only of, extermination. The younger of two sons of an English nobleman, he made up in pride for his lack of heri- tage, and had quarrelled with his amily-over- his father's grave. Subsequently, however, he had married an heiress of- more rank than beauty, and more wealth than either. She was the last in the line of a great name, and of vast estates that fell to her and the heirs of her body, and which, in case they lapsed, would go to a distant, unknowMn, and de- spised branch of the family. If he was unscrtpulous in the means he took for gaining his ends, it followed as a part of his character. In his mind, it was right for him to do any act that would advance his interests. His moral perception went no farther. His wife he had married from interest, and - with no pretence of love;" but she had turned to him with a singleness of devotion and sacrificing regard, that showed too well that she had never won by personal charns the affection her heart coveted. His great,: immediate ambition was, by means of his own energy and talent, and his wife's wealth, to attain a position in the political and social world where he could express his contempt for his brother, whom he hated as intensely as he could hate one whom he despised so much. In the accomplishment of his purposes, he had sought the theatre of war; and his wife, with that itenacity of affection, or rather sacrifice of self, that is not unfrequently shown by persons conscious of personal inferiority, insisted on accom- panying him. She went with him to Quebec; and two years and a half afterwards departed to another world, leaving a child, a daughter, that .had been born, six months after her arrival. Col. Cumberland had regarded his i:wife only as an investment. He had never pretended to love her; and when she died, as she had left an heir, he did not pretend to mourn her death. The child, however, was all in all to him. , I       .    .   ,54      'GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: Worldly interest and parental fondness seemed to unite in him towards this wee thing, thus cast, as it were, on a foreign shore, and to waken feelings that had hitherto been dormant in his selfish, ambitious nature. As all his plans and hopes depended on this child's life, he was naturally anxious that it should be sent to Eng- land, where it would receive more care and attention than among the strangers who had the charge of it in the city of its birth. His wife would never consent to return to England without her husband; but the child had no voice in its own disposition: and it was Col. Cumberland's intention, as soon as he reached--Quebec, to get leave of absence, and take it himself to his friends, and see that in every thing it was-amply provided for. His surprise and defeat, however, disarranged all his plans, and dashed all his hopes of prefer- ment; and now, instead of being on his way to England, he was hunting a road through the forest to report his own dis- comfiture, and perhaps be subjected to the humiliation of a court-martial. He- had not thought of being absent from headquarters for more than t;io weeks; but he had been sur- prised, his force destroyed, his retreat cut off, and he could return only by a long circuit, intercepting and joining one of the detachments moving by the western road fir6m the army of SNew York to Montreal. It was a long, perilous, and pe- culiarly vexatious journey; and, as he led his .small fragment of an army through. the forest, he was in the most vicious and implacable frame of mind. In his flight to the west, he was obliged to follow the old Indian trails; and, unfortunately, the one he chose led directly over Gault's Hill. The path they took was a well-known trail; and the spring near Gault's house had been a falnous camping-ground for the savages for a long time. The party had arrived in sight of Gault's Hill and clearing about an , hour before sunset; and, at sight of it, it occurred to Cumber- land that perhaps there might be an encampment of Yankee troops, which, if he could surprise, it would go far to wipe out the disgrace of his last engagement. The party arrived at the spring about nine o'clock in the evening; and here the word was given out that they would encamp for the night, if nothing new were discovered. - Strict injunctions were given that no noise should be made, and no fire lighted, till a re- oaunoissance had been made. 'The company therefore threw ,   .                      . .I   A FAMLY HSTORY.         55 themselves on the ground about the spring, and waited for their colonel to go, and examine for himself the prospect of an adventure. He took with him, for this purpose, his most expert Hndian Scout, - the one on whom he most relied for daring ventures and subtle resource. He was one of the last, of a tribe nearly extinct; and was so noted for his cunning and ferocity, that he was known by the name of "Sleeping Vengeance." The two advanced very cautiously; and, as they neared the house, they perceived that outside all was still and quiet, and only the gleam of a light from a single window gave any signs that any waking person was about the premises. Stealthily creeping round till they came within the glare of the light, they could see, from the stump of a tree, very near the house, such a scene as neither anticipated. Instead of a company of soldiers, making use of the house for a resting- place for the night, and who could be surprised, and taken prisoners, there was a fireside of domestic happiness such as -had not been seen by Col. Cumberland for many a day, A bright fire was in the broad fireplace; and at one side sat a  man of powerful frame, holding a large book open on his lap. At the opposite corner sat a-woman; young and beauti- fil, her dress partially loosed about the neck as if about re- tiring for the night, revealing shoulders and bosom of snowy  whiteness, while,a smile of playfulness and love was upon her face as she held up a child's night-gown- to a little girl that was -coyly approaching her from the' other side, now casting an arch look over her shoulder to her father, and then mischievously laughing and pouting as if yet unwilling to submit to the maternal commands. It was a sight to have softened the spirit of a demon, and for a moment Col. Cum- berland paused -to admire. But it was only for a moment. A second glance at the beautiful, partially undressed woman, roused in him a feeling of diabolical passion such as':'we read of having possessed the Cenci, or that," Sextus who wrought the deed of shame;"Gazing -with malignant, devilish eye for a moment, his resolution was taken. He bade the Indian return, and tell the soldiers to be prepared, if any one ap- proached without first giving the countersign of "King George," to shoot him in his tracks. Some one was then to make a noise as of a person calling for help; and as soonQ1 a. they saw a man approaching, as they undoubtedly wotuldatQ   "      GOMERY 'OF MONTGOMERY . leain the cause, they were to shoot him dead; but for no one, save himself, to return to the house till further orders. The Indian returned to the spring, and repeated the or- ders of the commandant, and then went back to learn and execute his further pleasure. They both now concealed themselves behind a fallen tree, and soon after heard a call as of a person in great distress. They saw the door open, and a man come forth, and look out. There was another call; and they saw the man turn back, and re-appear a moment after with an axe on his shoulder, and go forth along the path towards the spring. The colonel now told his compan- ion, as soon as he heard the sound of fire-arms, to rush' into the house, seize the, child, and make off with it; doing with it as he liked. "It is to be mine, is it?" said Sleeping Vengeance. "If you 'want it; but you will split its skull before you have had it an hour," replied the officer. "That is for me to say," said the savage, just as the sharp reports of half a dozen muskets were heard. The two sprang forward, Vengeance in advance; and, just as the door was opened again, they heard a loud agonizing groan, that was answered by a shriek from the wife, who rushed to the door in frantic alarm. At the threshold she met the uncouth figure of Sleeping Vengeance, who pushed her back into the room, and caught up the child-(that in its fright had jumped from its low truckle-bed), and rushed toward the door. The mother, seeing the purpose of the Indian, grasped at the child, and tried to tear it f'rom him. At this instant she was seized by a tall officer in uni- form, who thrust her back into the middle of the room, and bade the savage make way with the child. She made an- other spring towards the door; but the officer'hurled her back with such force, that this time she fell unconscious on 'the floor. He' then firmly closed and barred the door; and, with water from a bucket standing in the room, he dashed 'her face till she was roused to consciousness. The fire was still bright upon the hearth. He looked about to see that no other eyes were beholding him; and, feeling that the deed in his heart would not bear the light, he dashed the bucket of water on the fire, and all was dark.           '   In half an hour he left the house, and returned to his par-    A FAMLY HSTORY.         57 ty, who were waiting impatient at his long delay. His vic- tim he had left senseless in the house; and the remaining ejaculations of the child which Vengeance held in his arms near by was all the sound that disturbed the stillness of that Bdreadful night. i "Make way with the brat!" said the colonel, impatient and troubled. "Let us be off now!" "The child belongs to Vengeance," said the savage, mov- ing off towards the spring. Thiey passed the body of the dead pioneer, fallen direct- ly in their path, at a distance of about ten rods from the camping,-ground. Their companions were all on the alert, expecting an engagement with a body of Yankees; but their commander told them they were all despatched except that noisy young one that old Vengeance carried in his arms. '; But, to make all sure, I will return: come with me,'" said he, addressing two other savages that stood in front of him. "The rest of the party move on, and we will overtake you in half an hour." With the two savages he returned to the house, and bade them enter, and, if the woman were alive, despatch her (imitating the throat-cutting process), heap up some wood and furniture on her body, and set fire to the pile. The fire, that for the moment he had extinguished, was blazing brighter than ever on the hearth; and, to make sure that his orders were obeyed, he climbed upon the same stump from which he'ihad first viewed the' happy family cir- cle. The two savages had entered and despatched the wo- man, whom they had found insensible upon the floor; cutting her throat-from ear to ear. At this instant, Col. Cumberland gained a view from the outside; and a single glance sufficed to fill him. with horror, and cause his soul to revolt-within him.. Though he gazed but for an instant, the sight never left him.. It was ever after present to him. The murdered wo- man la y extended on the;floor, with a horrid gash across her neck; and the blood was fast gushing from, the wound. The blow of the knife had aroused her, for the instant, to consciousness; and her face assumed a look- such as trans- fixed the beholder. Her countenance looked more beautiful than ever in life, for there was an angelic smile. upon it;- aind the eyes, that rolled till they seemed to rest uphn him, had' a look all' unearthly, all forgiving, and yet all Wiithringi to? \    56  '!    GOMERY OFP MONTGOMERY : his guilty soul. But they had not the curse that the An- cient Mariner saw "in the dead man's -ye." It wasa look that served to illuminate the daik soul of him who beheld it, and to show its own blackness. There was a look, too, of resignation and of joy upon the countenance, as if the re- leased spirit, catching a view of the bright hereafter, had, on quitting its earthly tabernacle, left this glimpse of a brighter world impressed on the features it was leaving. Col. Cumberland turned away from the scene; but' that face was- ever present to his eyes,- the horrid gash; the upturned, unearthly eyes; the features of ethereal loveliness. He heard a noise behind him, and, looking back, beheld Sleeping Vengeance looking in at the window. He held the 'child, which was now silent, in his arms, its head averted fi'om the scene. 4' Come away!" said the colonel: "let us march " "Ugh! white woman very pretty.  White officer love white woman: ha, ha!" "Follow me," said the colonel, moving rapidly after the companyj who haqd taken up their line of march some time before. "Tell the others to make sure and set the house on fire, and come on."- The two Indians who had entered ithe house to fulfil their commander's orders, having piled about the body a quantity of fire-wood and broken chairs and tables, drew out some brands from the fireplace; and, as soon as the funeral pyre was fairly ablaze, they set forth to follow the rest of the company. But they were not forgetful of their own war practice; for the scalps of both the man and wo- man were taken, and also such trinkets and valuables as their eyes covetedand were not too' heavy or cumbersome to be, calried on their long and difficult march. The party moved on at a' rapid pace for three or four' hours; their leader ,urging them, every few moments, to greater speed. Sleeping Vengeance no sooner came up, with the company than he put himself at their head, carry- ing the child- all the while tenderly in his arms. It had worn itself out by crying, and calling for its father and mother;-and at length slept in the embrace of the savage. At about three o'clock in the morning, they came to another spring of water, with a small opening around it. The sol- diers here begged that they might be allowed to rest for a ,t   A FAMLY HSTORY.        59 few hlors; and the colonel gave a surly assent to their re- quest. The Indians, all but Vengeance, threw themselves, without waitingc for leave, upon the ground, and were soon asleep. But it was not for Col. Cumberland to sleep then, nor for long after.' -Not Hamlet's uncle, nor Macheth's wife, was ever troubled with such "thick-coming fanciesO" as was he that night. Every minute he would crouch and cringe and shrink as if some horrild phantom was before his eyes, some fearful sound piercing his ear. He walked back and forth; he closed his eyes; he put his hands over his ears; he whistled; he slung: but it would not do. There was before him, behind him, on this side and on that, the slame picture,- the fireside scene, the fire of musketry interrupting, the groan of the strong man, the scream and piereihg cry of the outraged woman, the shriek of the child. Turn here, turn there, it was the same. An accusing spirit was pursuing him; and, whether his eyes were openx or closed, that last scene--the sweet face of the mur- dered woman; the mild, angelic eyes; the heaven-irradiated festures; the gash in -the neck, from which the life-blood gushed-was ever present to his view. The child, overcome by fiight and exhausted by its cries, was now lying silent, and apparently asleep, wrapped in the blanket of Vengeance, and held gently in his arms as he lay reposing on the ground. - It had been carried away with nothing but its night-gown; and Vengeance was too cunning and subtle to expose so delicate a prize to the night air. Every person in the company slept, save only Vengeance and Col. Cumberland. The latter wandpred about, -endeavoring to shut out from his perturbed sight the ever-present vision. He would have given any thing in the world, excepting only his own child's life, to have recalled the last few hours. But it was too late now. The past could not be obliterated. The ,deed, too horrible, too infamous, to be recalled, or related in its details, had been committed; aqd how should he expiate lit? He would do any thing that would not compromise his family rank, or' be inconsistent with the name anrid dignity of the Cumberlands. His education, 'is pride, his rank, had all so tempered his character, that no natural right of persons, not of his own class, could ever conflict with the interests of his family. But he cannot long endure the phantom that pursues him,   60       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: and his thoughts are bent on some way to appease and lay it. The' child is the only medium; and he resolves that he will protect it, and do every thing for it in his power. And he imagines that thus he will atone for the crime on Gault's Iill --As he was moving along, turning his head, now this way, and then that, to avoid the dreadful sight that was ever present to his mind's eye, he was overheard by Vengeance, who was creeping stealthily behind him, holding the child asleep in his arms. "Yes: I willdo it. -I will take her to England. I will adopt, her as my own. She shall be the companion and playmate of my own child. I will endow her with a for- tune, and she shall marry a lord,-any thing, anything to put away that infernal sight. And isn't that enough? Wouldn't many a man in my country gladly sacrifice all the rest of his family to see one member in a family like mine? And what more can I do? My mind is made up: I Will do it; I will make ample amends. Now, you horrid spectre, down!" But the spectre would not down, notwithstanding these good resolutions; and in his despair he called out, "What more can I do? -what more would you have?" "Life for life," said Vensgeance, whose proximity had not been s uspedted by Cumberland. "You here, monster?" said he, turning gruffly round, and waiting for the savage to pass ahead, wlho, with a grin sinis- ter and devilish on his countenance, seemed to mock his misery. That night, he resolved that he would take the child from the possession of old Vengeance. But how could he do it? He first thought to order him to give it up; and, if he de- murred, to-reason with him, and coax' him with promises of large rewards when they should reach Quebec. Accordingly, when all the others were asleep save a sin- gle sentinel, the unhappy commander approached the spot where Vengeance was lying, holding the child asleep in his arms. "Old man," said he, " you must give me that child." "Give it to you? It is mine. No!" "But you must be tired of carrying it. I will order my men to carry it carefully by turns; and, when we get to Que- bec, I will give you a hundred dollals." "Aha!" said he, raising himself on his elbow, and looking   A FAMLY HSTORY.  -       61 sharply at the officer, and whispering fiercely through his long shark's teeth, "I shall give it to you, shall I? Ven- geance shall give his pet lamb to the wolf? He had not seen the servant of his great father,. the king, do an act that even the Huron would recoil from,-an act that would make the basest red-skin disown his own flesh and blood; ay, and give him to his enemies to roast him before his eyes, while. they sung and danced to the sweet music of his dying ago- nies? And to such mercy will Vengeance give this sleeping laimb? The tomahawk of the Delaware is heavy, and his knife sharp; but they are merciful to Mellita, compared to the kindness of the servant of our good father beyond the big waters." Cumberland turned away at this speech; for it was evident that the savage would bury his tomahawk in the brain of the child sooner than surrender it to him. If he would ever get possession of it alive, he was convinced now that it must be by stratagem; and he thought it better to make no at- -tempt of that kind until near the end of their journey. At the first glimmering of-day the next morning, the order was given to march. There had- been -no sleep for the com- mander that night; and he longed for daylights in the hope that with it the dreadful vision before him would disappear. Vengeance stole off in advance of the rest of the party, bear- ing the girl. gently in his arms. : The child at length awoke; and, after staring about in wonder at not being able to realize where she was, she- broke into loud cries, calling alternately for her father and mother. At length she fell into a spell of bitter, hopeless weep- ing, and from  that into a state of. silent and fright- ened apathy, and seeming indifference to all around -her. When the -party stopped to partake of such food'as their arms had brought to the ground, the Indian protector se- cured the nicest pieces for his charge, which he carefully- broiled, and held to the child's lips. At first it was forced to- taste the dripping gravy; but directly it seized the delicate morsel, and devoured it as eagerly as it had been wont to devour the tithits which it had received from a mrothers hand. On the third day after the Gault's-Hill affair, the party struck a cross-trail that led frbnm New York to Canada. They found, near where the ,trails met, the smoking embers * * - - . ' 6  -     ,   '  '   '  '   62'      GOMERt. OF MONTGOMERY; of a camp-fire; and, from a close inspection of the tracks, they were satisfied that a considerable party of royal troops had camped there the night before, and that their course ,was to the north. This was- a cheering prospect for Cumberland; for it was his wish, above all things, to return to Quebec; and, had he met a large party going the other, way, he would have felt compelled to join it, and go to New York, and there submit the affair of his surprise and defeat to the scrutiny of his superiors. He therefore resolved to follow and overtake this partywith all despatch; and, giv- ing orders accordingly, they overtook it the same night, and pursued their .journey with them to their destination. The party which they thus opportunely met was an escort of some American prisoners, among whom was that terror of British arms, Ethan Allen. The presence of this hero gave great uneasiness both to Cumberland and Sleeping Vengeance. ,The former feared that the particulars of the Gault-Hill 'tra- gedy would become known to the whrld through him; and Vengeance feared that he might interfere with the a uthori- ties at Quebec, and get the child taken from him. He and Cumberland, accordingly, both avoided the sight of the pris- oners as much -as possible; and not unfrequently the two would be the last of the whole company.  Cumberland appeared dejected and haggard. The savage noticed his wretchedness, and saw that he constantly seemed to be endeavoring to avert from his eyes an apparition br vision that was ever present in spite of him., From the mut- terings which he heard, he learned the nature of the appari- tion; and when the colonel fell back to talk with'him,-and to urge him to treat the child tenderly, he guessed the train of his thoughts, and was fully convinced that he meant to take it from him whenever a good opportunity should occur. Each day Vengeance saw that his face grew more haggard, his step less firm, his brow more anxious and care-worn. If he turned to the right or to the left, he seemed to see something that appalled him, and turned to look another way. But he could' not look in any'directiort more than a moment, but must turn away again, as if pursued by an avenging, palpable, and visible spirit. If the Indian chanced to be near enough to overhear his mutterings to himself, he found they were always onlthe same subject and in one strain. "Yankees, rebelsagainst the king. Ah, well! the   -       A. FAMLY HSTORY.        63 minister told me to show no -mercy; that I should never suf- fer from too much severity. But that look! --down! But if  the story gets out? He can't abandon me. He told me to show no quarter, but that the written orders must conform to the usages of war. Will he stand by his verbal or his writ- ten instructions? But why does that woman always look at me so? Won't I take good care of her child?" "You will!" says Vengeance to himself, falling back so as not to be suspected of overhearing. "Vengeance may sleep; but he never forgives nor forgets." That-night, as the savage lay upon the ground, holding the child asleep in his arms,he was conscious that Col. Cum- berlaud was watching him, though he had seen or heard nothing. Without' the least motion of his body that could disturb his sleeping charge, he began to mutter aloud, Ven- geance sleeps now; and the servant of our great, father, the king, may win new stars for his coat, new plumes for his cap, and a new victim of his brave exploits to bear to his own country to show to his chiefs and squaws. Ia! let him strike at Sleeping Vengeance, and he cuts the air." The officer fell back ashamed and mortified, for he saw that the savage was too vigilant for him; and he continuede to walk about till morning, to make it appear that his intru- sion on the Indian had been accidental, and without, object or special purpose.      . The Indian -and the officer now fully understood each oth: er. The former meant to keep the child, and the latter to get it from him. The officer was aware that it would. be im- possible to get it awayi alive until they arrived at their point of destination; when ie was resolved to do it, even if it be- came necessary to sh ot the savage dead. Once arrived at- Quebec,. he could easily render harmless the Indian compan- ions of their leader by giving them a liberal supply of rum; and then a single bullet would settle Vengeance, and place the child in his power. On arriving at Quebec, Cumberland burried to see his own child/ which, in spite of all his fears and misgivings, he found alive, in good health, and well cared for. His resolution was at once taken, that, as soon as he could rescue the other one from the hands of Vengeance, he would sail for England, takling the two 'with him. The Indians in his party had been promised large quantities of blankets, fire-water, ammu" * ' i, "     *     GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: nition, arms, and trinkets, which he took good care should not be paid till his purpose was accomplished, lest they should depart for the West, taking the child along with them. They were encamped on the outskirts of the town; and Col. Cumberland represented to the commandant of the forces then at Quebec that there was a white child among them, that could be rescued alive only by stratagem, and asked his as- sistance in obtaining it. ,The commandant said it would be well to arrest the whole party  and then, when they were surrounded and powerless, it would be an easy matter to get the child away. Cumberland 'kiew that it would be neces- sary for him to keep out of sight; for, if Vengeance suspected he had any hand in the movement, he would escape, and either take the child with him, or destroy it. 'The plan of the commandant was approved by him; and he was ordered to take a company of soldiers, and bring all the Indians into town. The next day, at the hour of drill, a company of infantry was- ordered to go out and practise their evolutions in the vicinity of their Indian allies, and to gradually surround them, and then march them all into town. Cumberland watched their movements unobserved and at a distance. He-had placed himself, armed with a loaded musket, near a path along which Vengeance would be obliged to pass if he attempted to escape, and there waited and watched. The captainiof the company alone had been in- formed of the real object of, making this arrest of the Indi- ans; and he marched out his men, and put them through a variety of evolutions, but gradually getting behind and en- circling the savages. From his concealment, Cumberland observed every move-. ment, and saw, that, as the troops approached the Indian encampment, old Vengeance moved away a short distance, carrying the child in his arms. "He is coming this-way," said Cumberland to himself. "I will shoot him before I will let him get away." The drill was kept up so long, that the wily old savage began to think that there was no other object in viewi and approached his comrades. Then the drill-officer undertook to suddenly throw his men behind him and all the others, and then, when no escape, was possible, to announce to them that they must march into town to be paid off. This was the advice of Cumberland,d who feared that the Indians   i A   A FAMILY IISTORY.                65 might otherwise suspect a snare, and be unwilling to enter the town, and perhaps make a great tumult and confusion, in which Vengeance might escape. Besides, he was afraid that Vengeance, after they were all taken, would suspect the real object, and, rather than give up the child, bury his toma- hawk in its brain.                 i The instant that the crafty savage saw the last movement of the soldiers, he caught the child, and ran; and the captain incautiously gave orders to follow, and bring him back, and kill him, if necessary, to save the child. Several of the younger and fleeter soldiers sprang forward; and the sergeant, who was in advance, ordered him to stop. But the Indian heeded him not: he, evens with his burden,  gained fast on his pursuers; and they were about abandoning the chase, when, just as he was springing like a deer along the brow of an abrupt cliff, the' repoi't of a musket was  heard, and the Indian was seen to stagger forward, and, drop- ping the child upon the bank, to fall over to the bottom of the cliff below..  Cumberland ran forward from his hiding-place, and, catch- ing up the child, hurried from the spot, without seeing or 'being sebn by the savage, whose ankle he had shivered as he was springing towards the top of the cliff. The Indian hid intended to drop down the cliff, and escape with his charge; but the ball from "Cumberland's rifle had caused him to drop the child on the bank, and tumble over himself to the bot- tom, some twenty feet below. He quickly scrambled to the top, however, but to find his treasure gone. Casting round his eyes, he saw the sergeant of the company running rapidly towards him. The savage calmly awaited his approach, his tomahawk poised in his hand, until he had -come within about twenty yards, when with eagle aim he let fly the hatchet, that whizzed through the air, and buried itself, to the eye, in the head of the soldier. With a yell of defiance, the savage turned, and jumped down the bank; and, by the time the others of the pursuers had reached the edge of the  cliff, he had hobbled away, and was nowhere to be seen. The child was taken to the house of the' commandant and strict orders given that on no account should any one, but the nurse that had been procured for it, be admitted, and that the room in which it was kept shouild be always- locked. He still feared the vengeance of Vengeance.-   "      GOHERY OF         . ONTGOMERY  Having, as he thought, secured the child in a place of safety, he immediately made preparations for taking the two orphans to England. He was not liable to forget his resolu- tion to that 'effect, notwithstanding the child of the mur- dered Gaults was now in safe hands, and well taken care of. The horrid spectre had nbver left his sight for a moment; and he was every instant turning his eyes to avoid the dread apparition that arose on each and every spot where they fell. He found a vessel ready to sail on the next day; and he secured a passage for himself, two children and two nurses, and gave orders to have every thing put on board early in the morning. The last thing in the evening, he went to give some final directions in regard to his own child. He feared at every turn and corner lest he should encounter Sleeping Vengeance; but having made up his mind that the greater despatch, the less danger, he resolved at any rate to leave in the ship that was to sail- the follow- ing day.    -  It was late in the evening when he came, for the second time that day, to the house in which his child was living with its nurse. It was the same house in which the -child was llorn, and occupied by one -of the wealthiest colonial, faiilies. The lady of the house had been kind to the de- ceased mother, and regarded Cumberland with great awe and respect because lhe was of the blood of the old nobility. This lady was greatly surprised at the changed and hag- gard appearance of Cumberland, and noticed his troubled countenance, and his constant efforts to avoid looking at something that seemed ever before his eyes.?,She remarked to her husband "that his grief for the loss of his wife had  wrought a great change in him. Fort her part, she had never suspected his love for her iwas so great." When he came to the house this time, intending to  pass the night there;, nd, as early as possible, go on board ' ,the ship in the morning, he talked over with his friends the adventures of hislate disastrous campaign; but he made no allusion to the affair at Gault's:Hill. Before retiring for the night, the father insisted on "seeing his child. The nurse was called in, and said it had been fast asleep for more than an hour, and, if disturbed, would keep awake all night. "Ah! well," said he, "let me take a light, and go in gently, and take a look-at her sleeping."'   A FAMLY HSTORY.         67 The good woman led the way, followed by Cumberland. They approached the door of the room, and gently opened it, and entered. At first the candle flared so in the wind, they could see nothing distinctly; but directly the light was, composed, and there before them, on the floor, lay the child, its throat cut from ear to ear, the head thrown back, reveal- ing the yawning gash, one hand placed under the head, the eyes open and fixed, and the whole-disposed like that other figure when he last gazed upon it, and whose dying look, from which he had turned sickening and horror-struck away, had haunted him ever since. Cumberland knew well enough who had done this; and turned, shuddering and appalled, away. "My God! -my God!" said he, "have I deserved a punishment like this? It is more than I can bear." He sat down on the floor, and for ten minutes -gazed with a fixed and rigid look upon the, infant corpse. It was the first steady look he had given any thing since the fearful tragedy at Gault's Hill. A search was made for the perpetrator of this deed. How he had got into the room, no one could tell. The win- dows were found fastened down, and could not be raised from the outside; so that he must have stolen in and out through the doors. The nurse testified that she was not ab- sent from the room more than half an hour duringithe whole evening. She had left the child asleep, and gone irnto the kitchen, and did not see it again till she had entered with the others to find it dead. The servants took lights, and looked carefully about the doors oqutside for traces of the murderer. They found some fresh moccason tracks; but they were all of the left foot. The report of the murder soon spread through the neighborhood; and, through the night, many people were on the alert, seeking for the maimed savage; but no trace of him could be found farther than a few yards from the house. Vengeance, though unsated, was asleep, i              'i      ,      .                l   68        GO ME RY0 OF MONTGOMRY  CHAPTER V. t, Mac.

THE impression made On the mind of Cumberland by the scene last described, though at first overpowering, was of ,but transient duration. Though all his hopes, his ambition and pride, had been centred in the child so fiendishy mur- dered, and laid before his eyes a mangled corpse, even that dreadful sight could not drive from his mind, ay, from be- fore his eyes, as it seemed to him, another scene a thousand times more dreadful. Even though forced to think and& look upon the ghastly spectacle- of his own murdered child, he would see ever beside it the face of his own victim     of Gault's Hill. When he looked'for the last time upon its sweet young face as it lay in its little coffin, his eyes were charmed away to gaze on another face, that seemed lying beside that of the childo and from  which he turned with a shudder. Those mild eyes, illumined' by a Jight pot of earth, were ever there to gaze upon him, and penetrate into the innermost recesses 6f his soul. Though Ven"geance had so fearfdlly provede himself wor- thy of the; name which had been given him, yet Cumberland feared him no less than before. I He knew; that, if the other child were not taken from the country very shortly, it would share the same fate.  He therefore decider to leave, as he had intended, on the first vessel that sailed! for England. ;A metallic casel was obtained, and 'the cofih containing the child placed in it, and put on board the ship.  Knowing the superstition of sailors in regard   to having dead bodies scn atdsrbd     huhatfrtoepwrnwso   A FAMLY HSTR Y.         69 aboard ship, he gave no notice to iany one of the contents of this case, but had it sent off with his baggage, and placed with it in his state-room. / The child of the forest was sent on board-with a nurse, and every thing provided for its health and comfort. At daylight of the second day, after the rescue of one child and-the murder of the other, the an- chor of the "Royal Edward " was raised; and wind, tide, and current all being favorable, the gallant ship was soon out upon the broad Atlantic. At sea, Cumberland had ample time to think upon the past, and on his changed condition and prospects. Even on board the L Royal Edward," the vision of Gault's Hill pursued him. His great grief for the death of his child, and the rec- ollection of its appearance when he first saw it dead, or af- terwards when laid in its coffin, were as nothing towards dispelling the illusion of that dreadful night in the forest. But the vision was more distinct at some times than at oth- els. .Being a man of strong will, of inflexible purpose, and great self-control, he steeled himself to the sight, and gave his thoughts to his affairs of ambition and business. But, be- tween the hours of ten and eleven' at night, the whole scene stood forth before him with such faithful reality of re-present- ment, that he saw as with the bodily eye the whole tragedy ; of that dreadful night enacted before him,--the fireside scene, the clatter of musketry, the cry and groan of 'the. strong man, the shriek "of the woman, the scuffle, the child borne off by the savage amid its childlike screams, and last, most fearful of all, the last look of the murdered woman, with those calmn,'heaven-touched, unvengeful eyes. From this the wretched man would recoil and shrink and turn through several weary hours, till at length, friom sheer exhaustion, he would sink into a state of prostration. and unconsciousness, that from syncope changed to a troubled; sleep of a few hours. And that was all the sleep his Nemesis allowed him. The waking thoughts of Cumberland were upon his affairs. in England. His wife and child being both dead, he could have no claim on that estate which he had long counted on as the lever-of his ambitious plans; and his thoughts were i directed to retrieving his fortunes, so seriously -damaged. However great his sorrOws, and however conscious of guilt, he was not one to forget his material interest, or to- sac- rifice to an uneasy conscience any of the privileges of his   '70      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERT: class. Though a younger son, he clung to the privileges of blood against natural rights with as much tenacity as though he had been the gainer by them, and not the loser. He was a scion of that class whose absurd pretensions have been so long recognized and deferred to by the common people of England, that; in their arrogance and contempt for all others, they unhesitatingly believe that God Almighty must consult them before deciding on any important point. Though the avenger is behind, and treachery, ingratitude, and crime, in front, if rank, title, and privilege loom: lp beyond, all right and justice are trampled as mere duqt and rubbish under their feet. So long have theirs arrogant claims been con- ceded, that they have come, to consider that no other class has any rights which they are morally bound to respect.- This characteristic of a class, as it is rdbveloped socially and politically, is typified in John Bull, whlo knows and recog- nizes no principle of honesty or honor,: mnd no motive of ac- tion, except English interest and power. Maxwell Cumberland, second son of Lord Maccleton, had all the characteristics of the class to which he belonged. Wilfiul in purpose, the opinion of the world was to him only the opinion of his own class. What others of lower rank might think or say of any act or measure was to him a mat- ter of indifference. ,His class moved in a sphere so exalted, that,- if they did not look with indifference on all below them, at least they regarded them as mere instruments, to be used or abused as might most contribute to their own pleasure. To them everything was subordinate to rank and title in the English peerage. That was their Bible, in which the most important .text, though unwritten, was 'standing forth on every page in blazing significance; for- it. read thus different from the King James's dishonest and sectarian version of the text, and was, ," What shall it profit a man though he gain the whole world, and lose his rank and titles and family 'states?         '  Jw hen fairly out at sea, and safe from the pursuing arm of Sleeping Vengeance, Cumberland began to arrange his plans for the fuiture. His former schemes had all come to tnought. With his child perished all his cherished prospects; and he now considered his position and th'e course that he should ' pursue. That there were .any rights of other parties not pertaining tobis class, which could interfere with any pl;ns   A FAMtLY HSTORY.        71 he might devise, never occurred to his mind. In brooding over his condition, his first thought was of his reception in England in his changed circumstan'ces; and he set about de- vising some means to save himself from the consequences that would naturally follow from the death of his child. In some way, he must save to himself the income of the vast estate which legally passed entirely from his control when his ichild died; and her cared for no justification in any thing he might do, except success. If, by any means, he could take rank with his elder brother by reviving the title of his deceased wife's ancestors, or by special favor for distinguished services, it was all ithe same, whether the means were foul or fair by which he accomplished it. The great, overruling idea, that the nobility was not subordinate to any of the rules of morality or honesty that,obtained outside of that privileged class, had entirely obscured any moral sense with which Nature might have endowed him, and which, under the social system in which he had been educated, he had been taught to despise, and exorcise from his character. His mind being thus agitated, and his conscience being thus easy as to the means employed in the attainment of his object, what more natural than that the thought should oc- i cur to hirm of substituting the living child for that which was j dead? The idea was no sooner conceived than his resolu- tion was taken. He was sitting in the cabin of the ship, muffled up, and gruffly musing and muttering to himself; when first the idea was suggested to his mind. The child, in its nurse's arms, was in the cabin; and its fair blue eyes, and delicate, beautiful complexion, so impressed him that morning, that he resolved to make it his own, and thus, as he i lhoped, appease the spirit of its mother, and carry out his own ambitious schemes. That night the wind was high, and the ship was scudding along before it at a merry rate, The fogs of the Great Bank were so thick, that the man at the bow could, see but a few feet before him; and the light at the foretop could scarcely be seen at the distance of the ship's length. It was eleven o'clock at night,' and every thing seemed quiet: nothing but the sound of the wind, \  as it waved through the rigging, could be heard. At this hour, Cumberland went on deck. The men at the wheel were standing silent and rigid at their duty. The mate was mov- ing about on the p0op-deck. The men of the watch were -'"."**      "   ? '   72       GOAM)Y OF MONTOMERY:  crowding in corners and nooks to avoid the blast. Cumber- land returned to his state-room, and taking from under his berth a tin case two fe'et and a half long, a foot wide, and some ten inches deep, went again on deck, and, unob- -served by a single soul, threw -the box into the sea. That night, no vision appearedto him; and, for the first time:-since the tragedy of Gault's Hill, he slept soundly in his berth. After that he spoke of the child as his own to the nurse, and to the officers- of the ship; and he hoped that the aven- ging spirit of the mother was appeased, and would -trouble him no more. But, the next night after casting into the sea 'the box containing the remains of his own child, the appari- tion re-appeared with more terrible distinctness than on any preceding night of the voyage. In due time the "Royal Edward" arrived at Portsmouth; and lest the Canadian nurse might have, some suspicions or knowledge of the child that was to pass'ass his own, he dis- charged her, and engaged another, who could have neither' knowledge nor suspicion. The daughter of David Gault, he did not doubt, would pass as his own, without question, among his friends. It was a much handsomer child: but there was not one of his relations who had ever seen the other; and-all they knew of it was from the letters its mother had written praising its blue eyes and light flaxen hair. Fortu- nately for his plans, the hair and eyes of the living child were not dissimilar to those of her whose body he had cast into the sea. He made his way directly to his former home, wherehe forund his relatives, and those of his deceased wife, eager to welcome him, and surprised to find the child so fair, since its mother was any thing but a beauty. Even the rel- 'atives of thb deceased wife said the child took after her fa- ther, rather than her mother. They also remarked the great change-that had come over him during his absence; and his haggard, emaciated appearance they attributed not so much to fatigue in the service as grief for the deceased Lady Cum- ; berland. His constant habit of averting his eyes from some apparent object that was invisible to them was observed, but ascribed to some nervous affection. No one ever ques- tioned him upon it. If there is one thing more than another that the people of the United States have to be thankful for, it {s that 4so    A FAMLY .HSTORY.        73 few members of the ruling families of England ever settled in America. A few of the old Cavaliers, descendants of the followers of Charles I. and the flatterers-of James II., came over at anll early day, and brought with them their class pre- judices and principles. They regarded the generality of mankind as made out to serve the pleasure of the king, his courtiers and courtesans. They held to the divine right of prescription,-that the Idng was responsible to God, and God only ;. and, if he chose to act the part of a tyrant and destroyer, the people had no right to complain, as the crown owed tio responsibility to the multitude over which a higher power had ordained it to rule. The malign influence of the few who did come was mostly confined to the South; and the ideas ingrained in the blood and bone of their ancestors -that they were born to rule, and live without .toil, and to look with contempt on labor and laborers has had, front its early settlement, a most baneful influence on our country. Nor is it yet extinct. Of those who settled in Virginia, many were early in their opposition to the crown in' the war of the Revolution; not foreseeing that triumph of deinocracy to which independence would lead. Conceiving themselves to be born lords of the domain, they supposed their clarims would be none the less recognized aftersIndependence than before; and, in gloomy and sullen acquiescence, they sub- sided, after the war, into the position which the popular gov- iernment, the fruit'of the Puritan element of the North, ren- dered inevitable.  Having obtained early grants of land from the crown, their descendants had that power and influ- ence that wealth confers; but, lacking the enterprise and spirit of adaptation of the self-made men of the North, their political influence dimninished in a still greater ratio than their relative wealth. And they never could divest themselves of the idea that they were the rightful 'rulers' of the land; and that there was something wrong in the sys- t,em that rendered it necessary for the son .of a Ctavalier, ' whose grandfather's skull had been cracked by one of Crom-  Vell's psalm-singing Roundheads, to sit in the national councils with a descendant of that landless Roundhead who ., had been guilty. of so disloyal an act. Fortunately, how- I everl for the country, there: was, even among them, a demo- cratic element that was largely influential, more from the tal- ents and virtues- of its representatives than from "any family 7     .                . .   74       GOXERY OF MONTGOMERY: prestige. Of these, the most conspicuous were Jeferson, Hen- ry, and George Washington. These men, and those who sym- pathized with them, were from. a different class in the old country from the Fairfaxes and Dinwiddies. They repudiat- ed alike the divine right of kings once held by the people of England, and the divine right of the nobility as held now by them and the government dependants, and acquiesced in by the nation at large. The power of the throne'has been absorbed by the aristocracy; and its successive occupants for many years have been- persons of so little enterprise, so little individuality of character, so little idea of their own insignificance, and the manner in which all power has been taken away, that now the cx'own is nothing, -.nothing but a popular -idol to the multitude; and the monarch who wears it is but an' automaton, that is made to speak the will of the aristocracy. But in spite of the bright examples of Washington, Henry, and. others of equal patriotism and scarcely less re- niown, thee influence of wealth among the early Virginians was sufficient to imbue many of those of a different an- cestry with many of their. aristocratic ideas; and as many  of the adventui'ers, who had been induced to leave their country for their country's good, had beenjprosperous in the acquisition of property, in some instances rivalling the Cava- liers in wealth, they had a natural desire to have families of their own; and, as it was not altogether prudent for them to return to the old country, they contracted with shipping merchants to have young women sent out to ,the colony for the liquidated sum of one hundred pounds of good Virginia tobacco. The' first that came were eagerly caught up by these suecessail colonists, who, had enjoyed to so great an extent, years before, the consideration of the Government, that it had sent them to the colony at its own expense. These people then formed the class that constituted the first fainilies of Virginia. Subsequently other cargoes of mar- riageable -women were sent over; but, as the demand dimin- ished, the price fell, and, instead- of one hundred, the ship- pers could get only seventy-five pounds of the Virginia leaf. Those who took these later importations, therefore, consti- tuted and were known as the second families of Virginia. In the course of the next one or two generations, however, the descendants intermarried promiscuously, and all traces                , .y   - A F AMTT, Y HSTORY.      75 of the second t families disappeared': all were, first-family 6Virginians. A rumor gained: currency a few -years ago, that  a lineal descendant of onie df the second families had been discovered by that indefatigable searcher after curiosities, :: P. T. Barnum; but, after diligent inquiry, it was found to be only one of the tricks of the famous showman to draw visitors to his museum. Though a wicked imposition, it brought great numbers to the show, and would have contin- ued to do so much longer but for the reason that it was pushed into the shade by the superior attractions of the "What is it?" The race of the second families became ex- tinct more than forty years ago, as was verified on .oath' to Barnum by the veracious Joice Heth. It may be objected to this historical figment thus intro- i duced into the body of a novel, that it does not stand to- reason that so large a class could be so suddenly extin- guished; or, in other words, that so many common people could, in the course of one or two generations, become mem- bers of the aristocracy. But our country has seen even greater changes than this in other parts. A witty traveller in this country has remarked, as, the result of his observa- tions in that city which is known as the "Porkopolis," of the West, that there the common people are those who kill pigs for a living, that the aristocracy are those whose fath- ers killed pigs for a living; and that the latter look down most contemptuously on the former as having no honorable antecedents, and bristle up with a grunt whenever allusion is made to the price of lard, or the philosophy of Bacon is contrasted with that of Aristotle. It may have been fortunate and it may have been unfortu- nate for England that a refuge was opened in the New World for the radicals and innovators who initiated the revolution that culminated in the death of Charles I. Had the escape been more easy, Cromwell would certainly never have been Lord Protecto, nor would Hampd*: ever have shed that blood at Marston Moor that was to prove-the seed of civil liberty and religious toleration. The idea of greater freedom to the people, and less prescription to the- king, was deeply fixed in the minds of the middle classes before the faithless l head of Charles was brought to the block; and after the death of Cromwell, though the nation rushed madly and eagerly back to despotism, it was not easy to obliterate   76       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY : from the minds of the earnest men of the time those convic- tions which had led them, through so long and desperate a war, to that freedom and equality before the law, under the protectorate, which they had never before enjoyed. With these ideas, when they found the nation going back so precipi- tately and stupidly to despotism, and saw people who had en- joyed liberty under Cromwell thrusting their necks, not pas- Jsively, but eagerly, under the yoke of the false and treacherous Stuarts, the leaders and radicals left for the New World. They were men without fame or name at home, except of being bad subjects, blindly insensible of the blessings "of a government that was instituted by divine power, and restored by special interposition. Left'without the influence of these leading spirits, their more passive followers yielded acquiescence to the reigning powers, until the tyraniny and intolerance of the crown broke through the'thick crust of conceit that hedged in the brains of the nobility, and let in the idea that a king who could be controlled 'by no earthly power was a very doubtful blessing. Had all those men of busy minds and advanced ideas of government remained in England during the reign of Charles II. and James II., and the influence of such characters as developed in the New World been walled in by the sea that surrounds the British isles; it is not unlikely, that, when thei time came that compelled a general effort to dispose of the'Stuarts, they would have been strong enoughl to have dispelled entirely the illusion of the divine right of kings, instead of transferring it from the throne to the House of Peers, from the king to the nobility. But it was not so to be; and speculations on the subject may be curious, but they can never educe a fact. ,a, -  * '       t *-,*    .A. PAMTLY HSTOR. Y,       77. CHAPTER- VI. s But thou who own'st that earthly bed, Ah I what will every dirge avail? Or tears which love and pity shed, That mourn beneath the gliding sail?"-COLLINS; THE events succeeding the death of Robert Gomery were as commonplace and matter-of-fact as could well be imagined, even by one whose whole life had been passed in that most staid and matter-of-fact land, New England. The shAdow of death had passed the threshold,.and left a deep'trace of sorrow; but the experience of several generations had taught the people of that day to rely on their own exertions and firmly do their duty if they would expect Providence to smile on their labors or answer their prayers. In spiritual matters, they put unhesitating faith in divine influences, but' did not believb that any supernatural interference 'vould be vouchsafed to save them from the effects of neglect of their temporal affairs. -The pithy advice of the great Crom- well to his soldiers, to "trust in God, and keep their powder dry," illustrates with great force as well as brevity, and in few words epitomizes; the religion and the lives of the Puri- tais. They believed ,in special providences manifestedein the saving grace rather than in the saving money, and had small faith in hearing an8 believing if they were not doers i as -well So, when affliction came in the form' of death, they did not consider it so important to say masses for the dead as to do their duties unshrinkingly to the living. Huldah Gomery was one deeply imbued with these ideas; and, though the loss of a husband whom she loved and respected was a terrible blow, she saw that she had duties to perform to the- living, that must be neglected if she gave way to unavailing grief. She had no time for vain regrets for the dead; and, if she indulged in them, it must be to the neglect and wrong of those who now might justly doubly claim all her care. 7 ,   78       GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY:  Her'children now required all her attention, and in them, all her hopes were, centred. These children gave that early promise which fully justified in other than parental eyes the good care and love, at well as high hopes, which she mani- fested for them.-  i But another great sorrow was in store for Huldah Gomery. Her daughter Eunice, within two 'years after the death of her father, was laid in the graveyard beside him. Early in the spring that succeeded his' death, she had often resorted to his grave, before the earth was dry and warm above it'; and, in company with her brother, she had spent many hours in beautifying the grounds around it; planting seeds' of the primrose and the myrtle, and transplanting the earli- est violets that struggled into flower at the sunny side of im- pending rocks. On one of these occasions, she had ventured oit in thin shoes at the middle of the day, and had become so busy in her pious task that she forgot her mother's warning, till the cold Maich wind of evening struck a chill through her frame. She returned at once to the house, and the next day was prostrate with cold and fever. She recovered from them both; but the seeds of consumption were implanted in her constitution, and a year and a half from that day she became a tenant of that graveyard which her "own hands had, in filial piety, labored to adorn. The Montgomery property, at the time of the proprietor's death, was every year rising in value. The liberal policy which he had pursued in his lifetime towaid settlers had drawn in a considerable population; so that it was the most thriving interior village within a radius of more than sixty miles. But, in 'order to make his improvements at the mills, he had been obliged to incur heavy debts; and it was debated seriously between the widow and-her friends, whether it wotild not be better to sell off the village property, including the mills and water-power, releasing all mortgages, and leav-  ing the farm unenciumbered. But Huldah, believing that she could manage the whole estate to profit until Freeborn came of age to assist her, objected to any sale whatever. She was confident she could make the improvements pay off their cost, and: that then she should have the whole property to herself and children. Her success fully justified her estimate. of her own business capacity and tact; for, when Freeborn had reached the age of sixteen, the whole property was free   A FAMLY-, HSTORY.       79 and unencumbered. ,Freeborn, however, was but little inclined to give his attention to the business of the estate. tie was more inclined to books than business; and his mother, ambitious and proud of hiln, though she much needed his aid in the administration of affairs, gladly encouraged his more elevated tastes. She formed high hopes of future eminence for him, and imagined that, instead of confining his talents to the routine of trade and accounts, he would one day fill some exalted position in the Government. Like most Ameri- can mothers, she thought that very likely he would be, at least, a governor of a State, and possibly president of the whole Union.         , Freeborn was accordingly sent away to an academy to prepare for college; and had nearly accomplished this part i of his education, when, unfortunately, the mills took fire one night, and -were burnt to, the ground. The college course was given up; and Freeborn dutifully devoted himself for the next three years to the work of rebuilding the mills, on which his mother was determined, and to lightening the mater- nal cares and responsibilities. He became the active business manager of the estate, and was soon known as Gomery of Montgomery. At the age of twenty-one, Freeborn. was still bent on study- ing a profession; and, as the affairs of the family estate were in a flourishing condition, he went away fropm home to a distant town to read law with a- famous lawyer of his day, who afterwards became chief justice of the State. When I say that this learned pundit had three daughters, aged seventeen, nineteen, and twenty-one, respectively, -all three famous for their beauty, grace, and vivacity, and afterwards to become more famous as matrons and leaders in society,-I leave it to be inferred t hat Freeborn Gomery learned some- thing more than law during his sojourn away from home. but sundry chapters must intervene before I relate the par- ticulars of this part of his life; though I may now admit, that, at a subsequent period, the most beautiful of the Mackenzie sisters accompanied him to his home at Montgomery.   80:      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: -, a CHAPTER    VII. ' Friendship is constant in all other things Save in the office and affairs of love: Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues. Let every eye negotiate for itself, And trust no other agentt. - MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.  DURING the time that Freeborn Gomery was away from home, storing his mind with' a knowledge of tfe law,'the country in the vicinity of his birthplace continued rapidly to improve. Settlers were constantly coming in from, different parts, purchasing land, and making themselves homes. Roads were made in various directions, large tracts ofland were cleared, and the hardy settlers were fast emerging from the trials of frontier life to the comforts of civilization. The arrival of so many emigrants from farther south created a. demand for land, and increased its value; and tie saw-mills at Montgomery- were busy in sawing up into boards, planks, shingles, and clapboards, the stately pines that grew in great numbers near by.  The grist-mills were also kept running ,day and night in grinding up the corn, wheat, and rye -that, were now produced-in abundant crops by the neighboring farmers. As has been before stated,-a large part of the ori- ginal Gomery Estate in the vicinity of the village had been sold off to the settlers, though the old home on the hill had been reserved by the widow as a homestead.    Freeborn Gomery, on his return to his native place, after lhaving been admitted to the bar, became at once the most important man in the vicinity; but, much to his mothers disappointment, he had very little ambition folr distinction or notoriety. He had no desire for public life, but was rather inclined to prac- tise his profession. His mother was far more ambitious than lie, and had so exalted an opinion of his abilities, that she expected-at one time to live to see him the great man of the State, if not of the nation, instead of the little village   A FAMILY I STORY.      ,81 of Montgomery. But Freeborn did not enter into 'any of :her ambitious schemes. His- plan of life was, far happier than hers. Hie :would have a home, for which he had already selected a partner; and would look for life's enjoyments in the home circle, rather than in the noise and strife of the world. But, as he knew a life of idleness was not intended for man's happiness, he determined to engage in the practice of the law; and, accordingly, he opened an office in the village, and- ovef the door of it this sign. was placed: "F. Gomery, Attorney at Law." He still lived at the Perch; and every  morning, at about sunrise, he might be seen clattering down the road on a stout nag; and, when he reached the level ground, he would strike into a brisk gallop, and sweep up through the village, to the great admiration of the milkmaids, who were sure to be out to catch a nod and a merry word from the dashing young attorney. He was a model horseman, six feet two in height; and his figure, athletic and graceful, showed to great advantage as he cantered up through the town on his stouit bay. His features, however, were, neither regular nor handsome. His nose was large, his cheek bones high, his chin massive, and his lips heavy arid firm, showing more of firmness than energy of character. The young lawyer had no sooner opened his office than business came rushing in upon him. In those early days of the town's settlement, the boundary-lines between the settlers were not clearly defined and established; and hence there was imjuch litigation between neighbors before eac/h knew what was legally his own. Then there were, annually, sev- eral " training-days," ' and one "general muster" of the mili- tia of the surrounding country; and, as they seldom passed. without more or less fights aid 'knock-downs, much law business resulted from these patriotic meetings, which, as they had been convoked-by law, were settled by the law, and Law- yer Gomery was soon in a profitable practice., His legal business so crowded upon him, and so completely absorbed his tilne, that he could give little or no attention to the affairs of the mills and other village property; and therefole, taking advantage of a' period of great' prosperity, when speculation ran high, he. prevailed on his mother to sell it all out, and conyvert the money realized from it into something that would require less care and attention. The shire-fown, with its 'county court-house,,as some twenty miles from Montgom-   GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY:             l -ery; and at every session of the district and county courts Freeborn attended, having a long docket of cases to be dis. posed of. Except in the winter-time, when there was snow on the ground, he always went to court on horseback; and his neighbors observed, that, after the term was over, he would, each spring and fall, be away from home some ten days longer than the term of the court. The secret of this ,was soon found out-; and several village -belles learned, to their no small disappointment, that his visits to the south- ward were no compliment to them; and their efforts to get the full truth of the matter were finally rewarded by an ad- mission from Fleeborn's mother, that herison was engaged to the second. daughter of Judge Mackenzie of Pittstown, and that they were to be married one year fiom the. coming' au- tumn. The good woman was highly pleased at the prospect of this match; for she did not think, any of tile neighboring damsels at all worthy of so great a catch as her Freeborn. Though a considerable portion of the -original Gault or Gomery Tract had been sold off, especially of that part near- est -the village, yet there was one spot on it which Freeborn would never consent to have sold, though willing to Isell, other lots at their value. This spot was about half the dis- tance from the village to the old houme, and a little back from the direct road between the two. It appeared to be a sort of hillock, or knoll', upon'that side of the great blill; and was the most-cotnmanding and beautiful spot in all the neighbor- ing country, save only the site of the old house, which had, long before, charmed the eyes of David Gault, and afterwardsa Robert Gomery. This place overlooked the village, and was in full view of the old homestead aind the "Arch Fountain," and was called the " Pivot."  The reason of Fneeborn's upwillingness to sell it was apparent a year afteli he had commenced practice as a lawyer, as he began at that time tot make preparations for building himself a fine house, with bairn, stable, and out-buildings, such as a man in easy circum- . stances might be supposed to require. In those days, the style of architecture was in most vicious taste. It seemed to be an emanation-of the Puritan severity and straight-laced ness, -- a-srt of ambitious simplicity. But it was a style universal in that region, and no house was con- sidered at all genteel unless it conformed to it. This style required that a house should be of two stories; have a roof   A FAMLY HSTORY.        83 without gables, but coming to a point in the centre; a light cornice; numerous and small windows; a main door in the centre of the front, opening into. a hall that led on either side into a large square parlor. The internal arrangement might vary; but the outward appearance must conform'to one fixed, unvarying standard,-a broad, bare, white front, re- lieved only by a single door: and the windows in' the upper sand: lowel stories gave the structure an outward appearance of cheerlessness and firigidity, frequently very incompatible With the warmth and hospitality within. In the centre of the house was an immense chimney-stack, having a fireplace on three sides below, and the same number above. - The fire- place of the kitchen was always made very wide, for the-- purpose of accommodating such logs of wood as were too large and gnarled to split up; and was flanked on oneside by an ash-hole and oven, that, for size, might have vied with a modern steam-bakery. The other sides of the house were very similar to the front; and, at this period, the extravagance of blinds was scarcely known. Seen at a distance, a house as plain as this did not make a bad appearance if it happened to be half hidden among trees. But in those days the great object of people was to get trees out of the way, and land was re- garded more valuable the less vestige of the forest was left upon it. It is not remarkable, therefore, that a lawn was a luxury' to the eye, and that-people, when recollecting so fi'eshly the difficulty and toil of clearing away the trees, regarded them as a blemish- in any landscape, and especially objectionable if they hid the painted front of a house from view. ' In this style was built the house of Freeborn Gomery, or "(Gomery of MontgomIery" as he was most fiequently called. In; addressing him, he was called the "Squire," or. Square," and sometitmes Mr. Gomery; but his usual appellation was the same as had been his fatlter's before him. The house and out-buildings were all completed in good time, and the grounds were cleared up, the stumps of trees- removed, new fences made, a large front yard, a lawn fenced in; and the place had a more pretending ambitious look than ; any other within ma    iles. Then came, to the astonish- ment if not envy of the mothers and daughters of the vil- lage, a'large quantity of furniture, of finer quality than had ever been seen in that part of tile country beforei; and it    84       GOMERT- OF MONTGOMERY: all wont direct to the Pivot. Finally, the fall term of the court came on, and the squire left to attend it; and this time he was gone lolfger than ever before. It was known at the village that the old lady, who, witha sort of respectful f miliarity, was called "Aunt Huldah," had been at- te new hllose for two days getting it in order for occupancy; and everybody in the town asked everybody else, as often as he met him, when Gomery of Montgomery with his new wite was expected to arrive. At last their interest in-their neigh- bor', welfare was- rewarded; and their expectant eyes glad- dened by the familiar sight of the squire's well-known horse "Ticonderoga" moving up through the principal street, draw- ing after him a stylish chaise, in which were seated the law- yer and his new wife. Beneilth the carriage was suspended a large square trunk, which,iit may be supposed, contained those articles of apparel required for the journey. Every thing else had been sent on previously, and had arrived at the Pivot some days before; and had been all arranged and disposed for use, ere the young couple appeared, by the busy hand of Aunt Huldah. The chaise passed directly through the village, and up to the new house at the Pivot; and: you may be sure the talk that evening through the village was of the bride of Gomery of Montgomery. But two persons in the village had got a glimpse of her face; and these two differed widely in opinion respecting her; as Was but natural; since one was Belinda Bakelr a fair, rosy, buxom lass, who for one whole season hadl scarcely failed a single morning to. cross the ioad with hel milking-pail just at the time that the young lawyer was riding by on his powerful "Ticondeiroga." As he always had a merry word for her, she had for a while indulged the hope that she would dlistance all the other belles of the village, and .catch the " square." The person with her,'who likewise saw the face of thie new bride, was Reuben Stockman, to whom she bad become engaged when  she found that Gomery did nct duly appreciate her charms. This coluple were taking an evening stroll bettween, sunset and daylight-down; and, though they acknowledged his greet- ing, they scarrcely looled at him, so staring and eagrc were they to get a good look at Iis wife. No sooner had they passed them than the fell to discussing her looks. Reuben thought her very handsome. Belinda'said, "It was no such thing, and that she didn't think that a man like Gomery of     \ A FAMILY HSTORY.  .85 Montgomery need, go away two hundred miles- to find a great deal better-looking woman than that. And I know she is a Tartar!" said she. "Didn't you see how her eyes flashed fire when she looked at me?"'  "No," replied Reuben: ." I thought she \had the sweetest look I ever sawr, and such a -sweet smile N0o wonder she caught the square " "It is a pity y u can't find ,one like her," said she pet- tishy '      .     ' "Might do worse Itguess," he replied; to which Belinda was :about to answer something still nmore gingerly, when they were hailed by a voice from a groups of persons near by, and askhed if thiey had got sight of the squire and his wife. Reuben spoke first, and said "they had,'and she was a darned sight the harnsomest woman ever seen iit Mont- gonelry."              .      - "She ain't, nuther!' said Belinda. "There's lots o' girls here harnsum as she."  "You may think so," said Reuben; " but I don't; and I don't, blame Freeborn Gomery for g6in' away to get a wife like that."  "I should be ashamed! I 6'pose you would do the same if you could," said she, the tears filling her eyess. "No, of course not"' answered he as the two turned away front the group, and puisned their walk. Reuben :cicom- panied Belinda, who was in no amiable frame of mind,' to her home that night., What passed between them before they reached her father's house is not known to the writer of this history; but it is certain the match was broken ff,- not to be renewed again for six months, when negotiations were olened, and a marriage-treaty finally effected:. There was wonderful unanimity of opinion, however re- garding the lawyer's new bride, when all had seen her, in 'spite of the adverse Judgment of Belinda Baker; and even she was obliged to own, that, in giving her first impressions, she was prejudiced. It was no .use to stand out against a verdict otherwise unanimnous; and that verdict was, that the squire's wife was a marvel of beauty. She was tall and grace- ful, with hazel eyes, and dark hair with the slightest possible tinge- of auburn. Her teeth were perfect, her lips firn and round, and moved witchingly to let escape the silverly tones of iesr voice, that was so soft and winning, it Was no wonder that   86      aGOMEiR. OF MONTGOMERY: the sensitive heart of Freeborn Gomery was captivated and inthralled. Her cheeks were not only rosy and fresh, but rounded out with those curved lines of highest beauty sel- dom seen but- in the masterpieces of statuary; and, when a smile lit up the ever-radiant face, the prettiest pair of dim- ples ever seen were disclosed. Indeed, it was a wonder that Freeborn Gomery, with all his advantages of wealth, talents, and position, could ever'win a lady so fair as she. The good people of Montgomery Village were greatly pleased, when they became acquainted with the squire's wife, to find that- she was as affable and condescending as she was fair. They had feared she would be distant and haughty, and assume such airs of superiority as would wither them into insignificance, and, which was worse, silence; but she was all courtesy and kindness towards them, and made the acquaintance of all the village people in a way that won their hearts. She was so extremely affable and conde- scending as even to shock Aunt Huldah. The old lady seemed to think it beneath the dignity of the wife of her Free- born to treat certain poor people so familiarly ; but the young bride seemed to find it a great pleasure to call at the houses of the poorest, and go in without ceremony, chatting with the mothers, talking over with them the ailments of the childrel, advising with the fathers, patting the heads of the little ones, and shedding a halo of light and joy that seemed to linger in the .house for days after she had departed. She participated in the tea-drinking parties of the village, and always found something to especially praise in the house- keeping qualities of her hostess. If a ball was got up, she was sure to attend; and she and her husband led down the dance with as brisk and reckless gleesomeness as the young lads' and lasses just out with their new clothes. Gomery of Montgomery was now-a happy man. His busi-, ness was sufficient to keep him employed through the day, and his evenings at home were seasons of unalloyed delight. He wanted for nothing. His opinion was respected by all his neighbors; and, if not universally popular, it was because in his professional duties he had had occasion to rebuke in- justice and extortion. He was beloved by all he could re- spect;' and for the opinions of others he cared little.? The dozen years that followed were of that placid kind that leave only pleasant memories. There were no ups and *                 . -- 1'-    A FAMLY HrORY*,         87 downs in his career. The days passed as monotonously as those who would always have to-morrow the same as to-day could desire. Those regular increments to the family that serve to give interest and variety to, the home-circle made their appearance with biennial- certainty; and, at the end of ten years ,after Freeborn Gomery had brought his bride to his new hordie, there were four children that played around his, hearthstone,-two daughters and two sons, the boys being younger than the girls, and the youngest two years old: but the season came an4 Went, and there was no ad- dition to the ntumber this year, nor the next, nor the next. And so the world moved on with this family as the wise would desire to have it, - devoid of incident to'ruffle the calm stream of events. "Blessed," says Montesquieu, " is that peo- ple whose annals are written in water;." and blessed is that family, that, holding fast to the golden mean, knows neither the anxieties of the ambitious and great, or of the suffering and poor. So it was with the family of Freeborn Gomery for the first twenty years of his married life; and yet,' happy t as his life had been, his mother, Aunt Haldah, had never felt . satisfied with his career. In her opinion, he had the intellect- ual capacilt to become one of the great men of the nation; and, if he would only aspire to a leading position in the coun- try, she did not question his ability to reach 'it. But Free- born had more sense and less ambition than his mother; and at last, when the old lady saw how contented a life he led, and looked upon his increasing family, that each year de- manded more of his attention, she resigned herself to his indifference to fame, and consoled herself with the'hope that his children would be more ambitious. She still con- tinued to live in the old. house at the Perqh on the hill, and superintended the conduct of the farm, though she spent nearly half her time at the Pivot with her grandchildren, making herself more busythan useful, but always welcome. But, whatever her disappointments and troubles,- they all came to an end solme fifteen years after her son's 'marriage. At this time, when little past fifty years of age, and appar- ently in the full visor of life and health, she was suddenly taken down with a fever of the most violent typhoid charac-cf ter; and, in spite of all that affection and attention could do, in three weeks she breathed her last.    '       " Some folks said of Freeborn Gomery that he did not show. A  X   -88      GOUfERY 6F MONTGOMERY: half so much grief and sorrow on this occasion as was to have been expected from one who had evei' exhibited so much affection and filial regard to his mother while living. There was a great deal of crying and lamentation among the children; but the tears shed by Freeborn and his wife- were not seen by the public. They both wore a look of calm sorrow on the day of the funeral, and, when it was over, pur- sued their usual avocations sadly, though calmly, as if nothing unusual had transpired. It was frequently remarked in the village, that, after all Freeborn Gomery's pretended regard for his mother, he did not, when the pinch came, show half so much love for her as did Tom Homer, two months before, for his mother, notwithstanding he had sent her off to die at the poorhouse as soon as she got too weak and feeble, to do any more work. This remark' was made in the store of Ira Miorris, the day after the funeral, by Stephen Gifford, to Henry Fisher, a son of our old acquaintance Asa. "I don't think," said Fisher, "that it is any great sign of love to cry for those that Nwe didn't care for when alive. My 'pinion is, it is remorse, and not love, that makes the tears come. You may say what you like about Tom Homer: I say nothing against him. He pays his debts, and does as he agrees; and, next to the square, he is the richest man in this county. 1 He has got but two children in the world; and I say that when he let his old mother, who had worked and slaved all her life to get the property, go to the poorhouse, it was a shame; and it is no wonder, that, when he saw her poor old withered body in her coffin, he felt greatgrief and remorse." "You don't know any thing about the matter," said Gifford. "He grieved for his mother, not only-as for a parent, but for higher and holier reasons. She was a good and a pious Woman,"       "I know that," said Fisher; C"as good a woman as ever lived in this town; and so much the greater shame that her son should let her go to the poorhouse." "I don't defend that," said Gifford; "-I think he was wrong: but yet his grief was sincere and to his credit, and will do much to atone for his unkindness in the great day. I have been at the communion-table with them both a hun- dred times; and it was but natural that when the minister " told of the great loss the neighborhood had, sustained by the death of such a woman - such a sincere, praying Christian,- t        '        '    A 'FAMLY HSTORY-.       8 and petitioned Heaven that this great loss to him who was bone of her bone, and flesh of her flesh, might be sanctified, to his welfare,--I say the grief he then showed' was much to his credit; and I think he made a great many friends by it, and that every person at the funeral thought better of him for it." "I wasn't at the funeral," said Fisher; " and I would like to ask you if the minister quoted the last words of the old woman."               ; "No: what were they?"          e "Why, when Homer was sent for, and told that his mother could not hold out till morning, he went over to see her; and when he first went in she did not know him, -she was wandering in her mind. By and by she came to her senses, and they told her Thomas was there. 'Thomas,' said the old woman, starting up and looking at him, --Thomas, why did you send me here?9 and the old woman fell back, and died in a minute. Now, after that, I can understand why he should take on so at the funeral. I have seen such 'things before, but none quite so bad as that. When people do, their duty to the living, they may mourn th6ir loss; but they don't bewail and lament and reproach themselves as those do who neglect and albuse their fathers, mothers; and other kindred, till they. have -left the "World and are beyond the reach of their cruelty, People like Gomery and his wife have no self-reproaches; arid, when death came and took away the old lady whom they loved so tenderly that they did all in their power for her comfort afnd happiness, they had no stings of conscience to prick them into loud cries of grief andi sorrow. They know that death must come sooner or later to all; and they do not fret against the Lord, however much they mourn. They are rather thankful for mercies received than complaining of those withheld." Youl had better turn infidel preacher; and done with it," said Gifford, leaving abruptly, and putting art end to the dis- cussion. However correct Fisher may have been in his estimate of the character of the grief manifested by Freeborn Gorinery, ; it gave no clew to the frequently expressed sorrot of his ) children. They only knew their grandmother as the imper- sonation of kindness, and her death came upon them asean irreparable loss. They knew that they had been often'wil- ,  *.   90      GOIMERY OF MONTGOMERY: ful, troublesome, disobedient, and unkind to her, and that she ever repaid them with gentleness and love; and now all their acts of unkindness catie up to their memories in re- proaechful contrast to her unvarying gentleness and affection. And yet-they had been alwiays sincerely attached to her, and, while she lived, thought th ey were dutiful and respectful. It had ever been their'custom to spend much of their time with her at the Perch, apd they all felt as much at home there as at their own home at the Pivot. The good old lady had always entered into all their youthful games, and had taught them those she had played at as a girl; and was never tired of hearing them repeat the lessons in spelling, arith- metic, and geography, which had been given them by the school-teacher. The old lady had also beguiled manybhours with them in recounting the story of the Revolution; and, as her youthful and more impressible days had been passed at the time of that struggle, it was not strange that her opinion of the English was scarcely more favorable than it was of the Indians. Of them both she had many stories to tell; and especially -did she recount to them that dreadful affair on that very hill where they lived, when the British and Indians came along and murdered poor Mr. and Mrs. Gault, and car- ried their little girl into captivity: and then she would tell how that, for many years after; stran'ge noises had been heard -in the old log-house where the murder had been committed; and even to that day the servants said the old log-house was haunted. But, of course, she always added, it was only bad people that ghosts disturbed; and if they were always good and honest, and did as they would be done by, they would never see any ghosts. , But the story, nevertheless, gave the children a great horror of the old log-house, that had been allowed to stand by reason of its historic interest, notwith- standing it was an offence to the eye, and cumbered up the ground. If compelled to pass by it at night, they always kept as far from it as possible, and always, when fairly past, cast a look back, dreading to see the apparition of the lovely woman with her throat cut. It was never visited/by them, even in the daytime, unless some older person was with them. Being used only as a depository for farming tools and rubbish; it was a great place for the hens to go into to hide their nests.

It was less than a year after the good old lady had been carried amid sorrow and -tears to the tomb that another event happened in the family, of an opposite character.

';    ( "Make thick my blood; \ '  Stop up the access and passage to remorse; That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose.'-- MACBETH. WHEN Mai  xwell Cumberland returned to England, after an absence of two years and a half, he looked more than ten years older than when he left. Though still less than thirty years of age, he might have been taken for forty. Then he was the picture of health; active, erect, and handsome, with a clear and steady eye, and a bold and arrogant air. Now he was haggard and emaciated, his eye unsteady, his look downcast and evasive. But, in spite of all his experience in America, he cherished all his former ambitiousplans; and, with unrelaxed tenacity of purpose, he made straight for the accomplishmentof his designs. And the prospect of suc- cess on his return was even better than he expected. The : only son of his brother, Lord Maccleton, was dead; and, if his brother would- only be so obliging as to die too, his way would be clear before him. And it seemed as if the elder was willing to oblige the younger;- for he was leading a life of dissipation and extravagance, that was fast undermining his health and ruining his constitution. He was, in all re- spects, different from his brother. The elder was weak and pur aposeless; the yon resolute and ambitious. The fam- ily estate was'encumbered and neglected, and each year the affairs, of its noble possessor were becoming more complicated and embarrassed. The younger brother, presuming that the estate would probably fall to him, regarded it as a sort of special. providence that had blessed his thrifty management; so that, if he should ever become Lord Maccleton, he would have abundant means to clear off all encumbrances, re- store and renovate the old hall, and make all other- needed   A FAML Y HSTORY.      ' 93 improvements. In overlooking the estate which had for. centuries been the property of his ancestors, he was morti- fied at the contrast it' presented to some of the thrifty coun- try seats of men whose ancestry, compared with his own, was but as yesterday. His father had been a bluff fox-hunter, who sacrificed every thing to his horses and. dogs; and his brother had added to these accomplishments those other, not so 'exclusive, but equally unprofitable practices,-gam- bling and drunkenness. But, by retaining his fraudulent hold on the estate of his deceased wife by means of the suppositi- tious child, it would be easy for him, should his beloved- brother be so obliging as to break his neck, to pay off all en- cumbrances, and make improvements that would render the place one of the finest in the United Kingdom. It was now a shabby affair, and was no fit place to which to invite any of the high officers of the government; much less the young snobs, whose pretensions give the tone of fashion in society, and among whom Cumberland was Especially anxious to make an impression. I His ambition was of a'higher order than that of most of those whose friendship and support he courted. It would not suffice to be a mere lay-figure, even in the most exclusive circles of society; but he longed for power and fame, and he meant to have themn: and he had the discernment to see, that, if he cultivated and flattered the young scions of the aris- tocracy, it was possible that they might remember his atten- tions when they became lords of the realm, and wielded an influence in shaping the national policy and the formation of his majesty's ministries. His schemes were, well laid and well digested; and all that was lacking was,'that a good Providence should reward his virtuous acts by taking his older brother to a brighter and a better world. His own brother was the Mordecai at the gate. As long as he lived, he could not come into the Maccleton. property; and the elder might be so unfraternal as to outlive the younger. Life, at best, is uncertain; and, for aught he knew to the con- trary, his weak and dissipated brother might live forty years, and perhaps leave a lineal heir to the coveted estate and honors. The revival of an extinct title wo uld be attended with too much delay for his active, eager mind; and then it would not, after all, give him what he wanted. He wanted to be, the Lord Maccleton, and restore the honor, influence,   "      GOMERY OF 'MONTGOMERY :, and glory of the name; and, not seeing his way clear-to his object, he was in a most unsatisfactory frame of mind. To add to his perplexities, he had made overtures for the daugh- ter of Lord Crosstree, and, though not directly refused, the noble lord indicated to him, that, while his daughter could love a Lord 'Maccletoi, she never could be made to regard with favor a mere colonel in the army, who, perhaps, would, never be a lord at all. It might be inferred from this, that, in the circles of the nobility, love was a thing not recognized; and it must be admitted, that, in drawing up marriage-settle- ments, it is usually left out of sight by the high contracting parties. But that love will sometimes intrude into most exclusive and best-regulated families is proved by the fact, that' the only sister of Col. Cumberland had so far disgraced the family as to marry a man without a name, and who had nothing to recommend him but his fine person, and an im- mense fortune which he had acquired in the undignified business of banking. His father had been a manufacturer, and had left him the nucleus of a fortune, which the young man had so well managed, that, at the age of thirty, he was known in Downing Street as one of the heavy capitalists of the city. For this upstart she had refused the hand of Lord Landisgone, a nobleman of blood so pure that it was ever br:eak- ing out) in scrofulous sores, the scars of which were con- sidered as so many badges of honor, since they proved his race hall never mixed and crossed with plebeian stock. By a judicious system of intermarriage among their kin, his fam- ily had kept itself elevated, and pure frEm taint of the com- mon herd; and as their connections were- all of the noblest families in the kingdom, and his title was as old as the Nor- man invasion, it was considered a great;shame that the Lady Henrietta had rejected so noble and honorable an alliance; and when it was- considered that to such a man she had pre- ferred a mere banke;, a, man who had made his own money, it was thought positively disgraceful. Success, however, is a great mollifier of offences; and -though it was long before the family would forgive the erring one for thus bringing disgrace on the noble house, and con- taminating the stock of the Cumberlands with plebeian blood, yet her husband, Sir Henderson Stronghm, was not a man to be despised even by such old aristocracy. His success in business had -been astonishing; and, within ten -years of his   A FAMLY HSTORY."         95 marriage, his advice on affairs of finance had been sought in government circles; and so useful had he made himself in effecting certain important loans, that his majesty graciously conferred upon him the honor of knighthood. After this success, not only without the influence of his wife's family, but in spite of it, it was finally concluded', after mature de. liberation, that a reconciliation should take place, and the erring sister be forgiven.  The overtures for a reconciliation now came, for the first time, from the country. On sundry previous occasions, the man of debits and credits had Approached through third par- ties the proud relatives of his wife, but had always been un- ceremoniously snubbed. The rebuffs he took with only the resentment of resolving that he would one day overcome their opposition, which he regarded as but just and proper, and that, when he was entitled to a recognition, he did- not doubt but he should get it. He therefore applied himself more assiduously than ever th the accumulation of money; for he had great faith in that, and believed that with money and tact he could get among the landed aristocracy, and that he could reward his wife's sacrifices for' him and his sake by one day restoring her to the society she had left, recognized as the equal of the best of them. Following the preliminaries of the reconciliation, Col. Cum- berland came down to London, and was cordially received at the magnificent town residence-of his brother-in-law, Sir -Henderson Strongham. His sister, whom he had not seen  for a dozen years before, had been: dealt with more kindly by time than himself. To her eyes, there had been no aven- ging power ever present, showing forth a ghastly spectacle that would never depart. Yet to him, notwithstanding his mind was ever active in the execution of his ambitious schemes, the d'readfill apparition of the scene at Gault's Hill was constantly present; and he could never keep his eyes in any direction for more than two minutes, but that it would show itself so distinctly, that he would be compelled to turn his head, and look another way. This restlessness of the eyes, and habit of averting their gaze as from some disagreeable object, soon attracted the notice -of his sister; but he explained it by saying that his sight had been in- jured by the -snows of Canada.  She overheard some of the servants, however, say, that, during the whole time her , .           .           .   GOMERY OP MONTGOMERY: brother was there, he walked the room every night from twelve or one o'clock till four or five in the morning. Was the tragedy of Gault's Hill enacted every night before his eyes ? He never said it. Lady Strongham had three children Of her own, the young- est of which was about the same age as Cumberland's pro- tegee, and, like her, a girl.  She was vastly pleased at the- family reconciliation that had just been effected, and at the prospect. of seeing her children not only relations but ac- quaintances of the old nobility, among whom she had her- self been born and reared.  She even indulged the hope of one day seeing her eldest boy the husband of her broth- er's child, who, besides her high birth, would inevitably be heiress to an immense estate. But, let the future have in store what it might, she was so pleased at the changed as- pect of family affairs, that she thought she could not do enough to gratify her brother, the colonel.  She insisted that his child should come to London, and live wvitlhher children, and have a home among friends. This proposition was pleasing to Cumberland;- and a messenger was sent into the country with authority to bring the precious dar- ling with her governess and nurse to the metropolis. Cium- berland spared no pains nor expense to obtain every comfort and advantage for the child; but he never saw it himself. From the first, it had ever showed an aversion to him, and, to avoid him, had sought the protection of Sleeping Ven- geance, whenever, in the journey through the forest, he had sought to ingratiate himself into its favor.  On board the ship, too, it never saw hilm but it turned away affrighted to its nurse; and he was convinced that the only way to over- come its antipathy was to keep out of its sight till the mem- bry of those scenes in the forest should be effaced.  The child, at the time of that fearful crime, was.less than a year and a half old; and, though it might always have a vague recollection of it, he hoped it would retain no impression of himself as connected with it. In the mean while, the report of the surprise and defeat of Cumberland's veterans by a handful of raw militia had reached England, and was discussed in high 'quarters, little to the credit br advantage of the officer in command. The Gault's-Hill affair was one of those common and insignifi- cant episodes in this war so unnatural and ungrateful on the   part of the colonists as to deprive them of the rights of civilized warfare, and therefore not likely to be remembered or reported in England. Cumberland, nevertheless, was ex- ceedingly anxious for a long time lest the facts should be- come public through the babbling of some disabled soldier, who, being sent home, might narrate his'experiences in Amei'- ica to some one who would publish the whole affair; but, as no mention was made of it in any quarter, he at length breathed more freely in the belief that his secret was safe. But he could not remain in England. After so inglorious a defeat, it was no time for him to retire. The stigma of sur- prise must be wiped out, and his character as aksoldiei re- deemed, and that, too, on the same theatre of action where he had incurred his disgrace. A few years more of absence might. largely augment his importance at home; and on his return, covered with laurels and glory plucked from the field of bat- tle, he might find himself not only a popular favorite, but a lord of the realm.' Besides, he was a man of action, and not a mere idle dreamer; and, as soon as his affairs at home were properly disposed, he embarked again for America; and in his subsequent career, by his reckless bravery, his 'ferocity of deportment against the rebels, his wanton destruction of property, his cruelty to prisoners, and his encouragement of rapine, he fully atoned for the- disasters of his earlier cain- paign.  A manuscript letter of thanks.drawn up by -tho board of war, signed by the king, and countersigned by Lord North, is still preserved at Maccleton Hall, suspended in a rich frame against the wall among the family pictures.. It was slightly injured a few years after, when all the pic- tures were hastily taken down and hid away in anticipation of the invasion of the ruthless "Corsican upstart." In this family history, which may be true in every word,, it is ndt for me to give any more of the events that trans-' pired across the water than is essential to the full under- standing and development of the story at lome.    If I at- tempt to give any thing more than the necessary incidents in their chronological Order, and seek to represent the 'man- ners, the habits, or the customs of a country of which I have seen but little, I shall probably make a ridiculous figure; and if I could succeed in the effort, even then the labor would be quite unnecessary.  Everybody, that reads novels in Eng- lish, of course reads every thing written by those two mas-  98       GOMERY OF 'MONTGOMERY: 'bers of fiction, more competent than all oth6rs to paint the characteristics of their own nation. The great genius of humanity, who evolves so much of the good that exists in human nature as almost to make the cynic amiable, has de- picted the inner man of the English. The kidd impulses, the generous self-sacrifice, the pure love, of which the hu- man heart is capable, seem to be incarnated in his enduring characters ; and whether we are following the fortunes of a precocious Nell, or smiling at the sanguine expectations of Wilkins Micawher, we can hardly realize. that we are not reading of living persons. The outer man of the English has'been drawn by as great an artist, but one whose genius is oflthe earth earthy, and who doe's not believe in the ex- istence of those qualities that the other conceives and de- picts. The one discoyers and portrays the good in nature; the other, theevil. The one sees love, affection, and kindness moving to acts of tnercy and benevolence: the other seeis selfishness supreme behind and governing all. The latter unmasks arid remorselessly exposes the shamis and preten- sions of society, and is accordingly courted andflted, feared, feastedand shunned, 'that his trenchant pen may not em- 'balm in the amber of his genius the stupid pretentious non- entities that float on the surface of high society. With a keen and trenchant blade, the author of "Vanity Fair" has divided the people of England into two classes, which are always with infinite variety of shading presented to his cos- mopolitan reader, - the snobs and flunkies. His aristocrats are snobs, whose pretensions make up for lack of talent and virtue among the staring crowd of flunkies that compose the body of the people, and who take it as their lot and their duty to uphold the divine rights of a class whose in- tellect, they cannot respect, and Whose morals they detest. The gloze of English society does not enable it to escape his eagle glance; and it is fair to presume, that if, after his sojourn in this country, he has not made us the subjects of his satire and ridicule, it is not because he has not observed' our national faults and follies, but that, in spite of them, he has seen that our people are free from that disgusting sub- serviency to sounding titles that has debased the m'iddle and lower ranks of ngland, as well as that supercilious arro- gance of rank, that, in the upper class, serves as a cloak for ignorance and imbecility. He has seen here that it is   A FAILY HSTORY.         99 "worth that makes the man," and not ancestral fame, good orbad, of honored men or dishonored Womainn; and that the peculiarities of our people do not interfere with the general happiness and development; that, in a land of great prosper- ity, exotics and demagogues flourish for a time, but only to wither after a brief day under the light of general intelli- gence and universal suffrage; that, truth being free, error must be short-lived; and that where education is general, and every mind active, or encouraged to activity, there will be the greatest advancement in practical inventions, as well as an uneasy restiveness Iunder any system or policywhich is not for the general good.

THE village of Montgomery, we have already said, was as thriving and bustling a little place as any within many miles of it. Owing to the wise forecast of the elder Gomery, the first. settlers had been of a class superior to the average of those in the neighboring towns. If a iian of good character and habits came into the village with a view of settling there, he would    k give him strong   inducements to do so; but a seedy fellow, out a-. elbows, who: wanted credit for his grog-bills, was al- ways told that there was no land for sale there, but it was plenty and cheap a few miles farther on. It seems inevitable, however, that, in every new   country,? there should be a great deal of litigation.   One great cause is the uncertainty of boundaries--between neighbors.   Anoth- er is, that the   people are  exposed to a  rough  and hard life, that renders them less reluctant to engage in personal frays and grog-shop broils than in Iparts that have been longer settled, and where the supremacy bf law is better established. The pioneers of a -new  country are also so far removed from the restraints of the society in which they were brought up, that they are not withheld by it tom   asserting  their rights according to those   primitive expounders of jurispruden6e, the strong arm   and bony knuckles. But with. civilization came evils not known   among barba- rians.  In organized society, it is fund that the- men who flourish on the vices, follies, and misfortunes of their neigh-   'A FAMLY HS'tORY.        101 bors, are the most influential, and frequently the most re- spected, of any in the community. These are the lawyers and doctors. They both flourish on moral or physical ail- ments. The latter profit by the violation of Nature's laws in over-indulgence of the appetites; and the former profit by the pig-headed obstinacy and selfishness of those who violate that higher law which says, "Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you." Yet, as long as human na- ture is as it is, it must needs be that offences, must come; and as we are to dieal with the world as it is, and not as it ought to be, and as complaining will not improve qr change it, we will accept it as we find it, well pleased to know, that, though lawyers live and flourish on the vices and follies of mankind, there are many members of the profession as free from those vices or follies as human nature admits, and who are more prompt to warn, their clients of the uncertainties and expenses of litigation than to urge them to, enter its- winding, uncertain labyrinths. Of this class was Freeborn Gomery. But in spite of his oft-repeated advice to his clients to avoid the law, and settle their difficulties by compromise or reference, he had, for the first few years after he opened his office, as much as he could do. It gradually fell off, however, as the town improved, both for the reason that there was less law business in' the town to be done, and that, in the'adjoining towns, limbs of the profession had been domiciled, who secured a large share of the practice .that had previously fallen to Gomery of Mont- gomery. Nor was he unwilling to see it diminish: on the contrary, he was rejoiced at it, and was frequently more frank than mild, when people applied to him to bring suit on some trivial matter, in the6 advice he gave them. He was now in easy circumstances, and was as rich, so he said, as he wanted to be; and he told people who sought his services that he would not engage himself in the petty quarrels of those who were fools enough to resort to the law for redress in cases where the expenses of the action would very likely exceed the amount in dispute. It was only in important suits that his services could be obtained; and not then, except his client was obviously in the- right, a rnd must suffer injustice unlessh e took up his case. He had a farm of a hundred acres of the 'original Gault Tract, and he preferred to-devote his tine to thattrather than firet himself- over the strifes and,- 9    102      GOMERY OP MONTGOMERY: perplexities of the law. His two boys were now two good- sized lads, that, according to his old-fashioned ideas, could be benefited by being put to work on the farm; and while they hardened their hands, and knit more firmly their frames, they would learn both how to do and how to endure, and would likewise be made to appreciate the cost and value of money. He had never been exactly a popular man.; though all stood in awe of him, and courted his good opinion. But he had never soughUtthe popular favor, and never yielded to popular passions or prejudices; and in these later years, when- endeavoring. to get out of practice,-he was-often .so churlish and severe as to give serious offence. His business, however, held on against his will, sufficient to require his regular attendance at the district county courts; though it was not unfrequently the case that he would find, on his return home, that his entire fees would not suffice to pay his tavern-bills and river-toll. Hence it is no wonder he became disgusted withi'his profession. It took him from his home, to which, when away, his heart was ever turning ;  andit brought no corresponding, returns: and he longed- to withdraw from  it altogether. His neighbors and former cli- ents knew of his aversion to taking up any new business; but, as a case was considered more than half won when he - took hold of it, he was still often importuned for counsel and service.     '  An incident at this time so clearly manifested his repug- nance to the profession, that afterwards it was considered a trespass on good nature to solicit his aid in a lawsuit, and from thenceforth no one had the face to ask it; and it was only when he volunteered in some cases of flagrant wrong that his voice was ever heard in a court, of law. The incident was this: Two of his neighbors, both honest, industrious men, andi members of the same church, one a farmer and the other a blacksmith, had a sharp pass at a con- ference that at once put an end to-a friendship of years, and made them implacable enemies. They-had lived long within a stone's-throw of each other, and had bought and sold,-bor- rowed and lent, all the while in great. confidence and friend- -ship, until now; when Brother Craig felt called upon to ex- press a fear that' Brother Cook was falling from the sterner doctrines of Calvin, and regarding with-too great favor, or at least" indulgence, the heresy- of Arminianism. This was f    'A FAMLY HST RY.        103 touching Cook on a tender point;. and he replied with'more sharpness than he was wont, and came back with interest on, his accuser, saying it ill became him to call into account the orthodoxy of a brother in the church, when it was known that his own daughter was being courted at that very time by a man, who, in spite of his good, clothes ahd fair words, was: a gieat deal worse than an infidel; for, instead of not be- lieving that the eternal misery of the wicked was pre-or- dained and predestinatedl from the foundation of the world, he did not believe in endless misery at all; and that was a great deal worse than believing, that, by faith and works, people could work out their own salvation. "One is just about as bad as the other," said Craig. "If we let go the good old hope and doctrife of election, we don't know where we shall bring up; and, if we open the gates to let in one error, the waters of heresy will rush in, and all the hopes of all evangelical Christians will be destroyed." "'Ah! it is very well," retorted Cook, "for you to be so strict on other people, when your own daughter is going to marry an unbeliever, - a worse than an infidel; a man who. makes light of all our glorious hopes of immortality, when we shall sit in high places, and sing glory and hallelujahs as we look upon the wicked in hell and in torment." Deacon Craig was incensed that his family-matters should thus be made a subject for church-discipline. The first allu- sion to them by Co6k he had not noticed; but, when he saw that it was Cook's determination to force the church to take action upon it, he waxed warm, and told him he would never brook such interference. He said he would be proud to own Caleb Thornton as a son-in-law; for, though he could not agree with him on points of belief and doctrine, he did tnot doubt that the Lord would yet open his eyes to the-truth. And he continued: "As for Brother Cook, I never heard of his objecting to his visiting his family, and waiting on his daughter Salome, and even going to a ball with her; yes, brothers and sisters, going to a ball with her!- a thing he never al- lowed any of his children to do before. As long as he had any hopes of getting him for Salome, he had not a word to say agin him or his religion; but, as soon -as he found out that he was engaged to my daughter Lucy, he is so disap- pointed, he tries to set -the church-by the ears, and ,so break off the match. Now, brothers and sisters, that. is-all   104 .      GOIERY OF MONTGOMERY: there is about it; and I say to you, if Caleb Thorpton wants my Lucy, and my Lucy wants' Caleb Thornton, not all the Cooks in the devil's kitchen can stop their marriage."  Poor Ipucy was present at this scene. At the first allusion to a subject so unpleasant to her, she blushed, and hid her face! in her handkerchief; and ere long, as the discussion pro- ceeded, she sobbed aloud; -and, before it was concluded, she got up and left the church.!Salome Cook, who had not spoken to her for two months before, - not since it was known to her that Lucy, and not herself, W'as the one preferred by Caleb,- followed, her out, not less vexed, and endeavored 'to comfort her. It is true, she had put all these accusations into the head of her father;- but, she had not anticipated a scene like this; and when she overtook her old, and once most intimate, friend, sobbing in the entry of the church, she threw her arms around her neck, and kissed her; and bare- ly saying, "Do forgive me, Lucy!? she, too, burst into tears. Of course the young folks were good, friends after that; but not so with the parents. The scene at the church was stopped by the other members, while each of the belliger- ents went home to furbish his 'arms for war.  Each began to count up the' favors he -had done, and the credits he had given'to his neighbor since the last settlement, five years before; to recall the implements lent, the labor given, the payments made, and to array all his charges into an account. They both were oblivious of any thing, and every thing re- ceived in- return. Cook could remember how he had shod Craig's oxen the winter before; but he had entirely forgotten that he had had the use of the cattle for a couple of days, in hauling up his winter wood, in payment therefor. Craig remembered how his oxen were employed; but the shoeing had escaped his memory. So, much to their surprise and satisfaction, both found they had larige accounts one against the other; and Brother Craig, whose charges summed up nearly a hundred dollars, sent word to Cook that he must settle up, and pay what he owed, or he would sue him. Cook answered very testily, that he might sue as soon as he pleased, and the sooner the better, for it would save time and trouble; that Craig was owing him over seventy dollars, and he wanted the money, and, what was more, he meant to have :it. Three village of Montgomery was in an uproar. - The scan- /    A FAMLY HSTORY.         1 . 05 dal at the conference-meeting was common talk; and people took sides as friends and foes of the different parties. The principals in the quarrel went at once to consult Lawyer Gomery; for public opinion would, in such a case, inevitably  follow where he led; and, though he did not belong to the same church with them, each belligerent felt, that, if it were; known that Gomery of Montgomery had agreed to take up "his -cause, it would avail more in the general community than the unanimous approval of every church communi- cant. Cook was the first to get his ear, and pour forth his griev- ances. But the lawyer told him, as he afterward did Craig, that they were. both very foolish; and advised that they should meet together, and talk over affairs, and come -to an amicable arrangement, and, by all means, to avoid. the law; that it would be much cheaper for each one to pay the full account of his erring neighbor than to get involved in the' expense and uncertainties of a lawsuit. In fact, he extorted a p'romise from each to have a talk with his neighbor, and endeavor to come to a settlement. A meeting was accord- ingly held for this purpose at Cook's house ; and the result of it may be inferred from the fact, that, after an interview which began with gentle breezes that increased into a raging hurricane, Craig told his former friend, but present enemy, that it was only because he was in his own house that he did not give, him a black eye. After this altercation, there was less hope of an amicable adjustment of the war. -Before the first blow had been struck, the overtures of peace',had been rejected on both sides with scorn, and the war must go on. The belligerent parties talked with their respective friends, and, of course, received cons'olation and encourage- ment from this source." As the deep mutterings of the dis- tant thunder foretell the coming storm, so did the busy whispering in every house in the village of Montgomery foreshadow that a neighborhood- war was about to break forth. But as a preliminary to a formal declaration of hos. tilities, in the form of a suit for damages, each of the parties in interest rushed to the house of Lawyer Gomery- he was now seldom at his office in the village,---to tell him of the' dishonesty and overbearing insolence of his neighbor, ; and to insist that it was his duty as a man to use his infiu- x            , *., a   '        t      b   106--     GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: j ence in checking the rapacity and arrogance fof such notori- ous rascals. It was- no longer Brother Craig and -Brpther Cook, but that knave Craig and that scoundrelCookl The lawyer heard their stories patiently, and saw from the incongruities of their statements, though both meant to tell him the truth, that there was no hope of their coming to -an understanding between themselves. 'He therefore advised them to, refer the whole matter to two disinterested men, wrho should examine into the accounts; and, if they could  not agree, then a third should be called-in to act as umpire; and thus the -whole matter should be finally and" irrevocably disposed of. To this plan they both agreed; but it failed to work, for the reason that each had taken care to get a pledge from the person which he selected, that he would choose for the third one, or umpire, a person approved of his principal. At one time, it was suggested that Lawyer Gomery himself should be umpire; but Craig would not consent to that un- less he would promise to throw out such of Cook's charges as were iot entered in his own account at the time the ser- vice was rendered. Cook wrould have him to judg' how i much Craig owed him; and, if he found it near a reasonable amount, he would take it, and-they would pass receipts. As they could get no nearer than this, all idea of an arbitrament was at an end; and both parties refused to submit to any thing less than the stern verdict of the law. The village of Montgomery was in wild commotion. Nothing like it had ever been known before in that gener- ally peaceful, quiet, and sober community. Neighbor was arrayed against neighbor.  People talked of it going to church, before the church-door, and on their way home from l church.  Some took sides Zwith Craig, some-with Cook. They even began to talk about it in Thomrnton's store; but he had the good sense to prohibit their discussions; an$ then theebar-room of the tavern was the scene of the excited and sometimes angry discussions. Everybody ran to Lawyer Gonmery to ask his opinion on the different points in the case, which was, of course, to be given gratuitously, and then transferred to the friend of the person who obtained it. But the lawyer had no advice to give, except that recourse to the courts of law was, of all thingS, to be avoided. A young lawyer named Clofton had moved into Mout-' gomery a few weeks" before this--and opened an -office and i ,                   ) $   A FAMLY HSTORY. .   :    07 pult out a large sign in letters of bright gold-leaf, that an- nounced his occupation to be that of attorney-at-law. As yet, he had had no practice: not a client had ever tapped at his door. The talk of, everybody was of law, law, law; and yet he, the only man that had that commodity to sell, was not consulted by either party.- Nevertheless, he was free in expressing his opinion, and signified to the friends of both that the case was beyond a peradventure.  A friend of Cook's asked him what he meant by that; and he said that if the blacksmith knew his rights, and had the spirit to resist being trod upon, he would not wait an hour, but bring an action at once, and he was sure not only to recover the full amount claimed, but heavy exemplary damages. This expression of the young Coke came, as it was intend- ed it should, direct to the ears of Cook. . An opinion so en- tirely in accordance with his own ideas at once raised the new lawyer to a position of great respect in the mind of the black- smith. He determined to go and consult him the- next morning. Hie still ould have preferred Gomery; but Gom- ery was obstinate and churlishi: end as the expression of the. young attorney evinced so correct-a knowledge of what the. law ought to be, whether it was or not, he would give him .a trial. The next morning, therefore, when he sawh him going over from the tavern to his office, he threw aside his leather apron, and washing his hands and face in the trough in-which he was used to cool his irons and temper his steel, and rolls. ing down his shirt-sleeves, he put on his coat and hat, andl started to consult the young attorney. But, as is often the case, events of the most trifling importance, seemingly, change the entire fortune of men and women, and, of course, history. Had Cook gone .r'ectly, and without interruption, to Clofton's office, the suit would probably have been colnm- menced that day. But it was not so to be; for, as fate would have it, he had . hardly got out of his shop when- he chanced to meet Artemus Diller, the tavern-keeper, a loqua- cious, well-meaning little man, who, besides looking after:the wants of his guests, attended to the business of-all his  neighbors much more faithfully. "Well, well'!" says the little Boniface as soon as he saw the son of Vulcan," this, new lawyer says you have no case at all;.and, if Craig has only spunk enough to go to law, he   108      GOIMERY OF MONTGOMERY: dan get such a judgment that you will have- to mortgage your:shop-tools and all." "Ah " says Cook, " he said that, did he?" "He told Joe Sanderson so, Craig's hired man; and I heard him say it.' I "But he told my wife's brother that I had a good case, and. would be a great gump not to sue; that I should recover , ny full account, and more too." "Well, it's no affair of mine: you know I never meddle in -the affairs of my neighbors. I'only tell what I heard last night with my own ears in my bar-room, sitting behind the bar, and Joe Sanderson comin' in to get a drink of rum and water, and sugar in it too; -and Clofton he sot there readin' a paper: you know he boards at my tavern; though I've seen only three dollars of his money since he come there, now it is nigh on to three months ago." Cook walked on, leaving the little landlord. still talking, and. musing on what he had told him. Before he reached the door of Clofton's office, he concluded he would Shave one more talk with the old lawyer before taking extreme meas- ures. So' he turned on his, heel, and walked back to his shop, and, resuming his leathern apron, began hamlfmering away at his anvil. i    \ Craig, too, had come to the same conclusion as Cook, hav- ing heard that Clofton was giving such contradictory advice tto the friends of the opposite parties. So it happened that  both had. determined to consult again with Gomery of Montgomery.          - The first on the' ground at, the Pivot was Cook. This time he took all his accounts aind memoranda, and, laying them before the lawyer, again besought him to take' hold of the case in his behalf. The lawyer thought that he would now make a final ffort to bring him to agree to some sort of a reasonable settlement. He therefore took him into his pr i- vate room, and sitting down with him by a table, with the accounts before them, he examined, item 'by item, all his figures; and, in a tone and manner that Cook did not care to disregard or resist, lie told him what he had overcharged, what he had charged that he ought not to, and would not have put into his account but for the miserable quarrel in which -they had engaged.- Then he reviewed with equal sCtmltiny the credit side of his books; and, instead of the   Ar FAMLY HSTORYt        109 credit given -to Craig- for the items allowed, he told him he must alter them-to conform to what was usually considered- fair and just in the neighborhood. All these changes in. his accounts Cook was compelled to make with his' own hand, under the stern eye of Gonery of Montgomery; and then, when the account was cast up:, he found that Craig owed him only fifteen dollars, instead of seventy-five. This sum Cook agreted to receive as a final settlement, and balance ac- counts. The next morning, Gomery sent a message to Craig, re- questing him to call that evening at the Pivot, and bring all his account-books with him. The request was readily com- plied with, as he, before that, had determined to do the same* : thing. His accounts, both debits and credits, were all exam- ined with the same scrutiny that had so contracted Cook's. But he found Craig neither so fairly disposed, nor so reason--  able in his charges, as Cook. He 'alleged that Cook owed him little short of a hundred dollars; but when the lawyer instanced this or that item that he had seen on Cook's book's, but which Craig had never given credit for, and yet could not deny or dispute, the larger figures melted :away; and, when the whole had gone through the contracting cru- cible of the lawyer's mind, there was found to be only the small sum of seventeen dollars due the farmer from 'the blacksmith. The amount astonished :Craig; but, as he :ied assented to each item, he could not well refuse the total; and so he consented, that, if Cook would pay that amount in cash, he would square off accounts with him. After Craig had left him, the lawyer began to consider de. liberately the difficulties of the case. With all he could do, he found it beyond his power to make the accounts of the quarrelsome neighbors harmonize. There was a discrepancy of thirty-two dollars in spite of all his efforts; and as he sat alone in his room, reflecting on the folly and obstinacy of human nature, he said thus to himself:-        - "Here are these two honest, hard-working men, whlo have fallen out; and both seem bent on ruining themselves and their families so-; {r than give in a single inch. Ifsthey once get into law, no one' can foresee the end of it. They have traffickedd a good deal together, and neither thought of taking any advantage of the other; and the number of items in their accounts which have been running on for  , 10         -   '       '   *110      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: years is necessarily large. But, as long as they were friends, they supposed their accounts were about even; and, 'had they continued friends, neither would have cared for  a a settlement for forty years to come. To prove their bar- gains, sustain their charges, and justify their accounts, will require a great many witnesses, some of whom must be brought at large expense from a distance. Their quarrel has annoyed me already very much; and, if they once get into the hands of the young sprigs of necessity, I shall have little peace for a year. Therefore the cheapest and best way for me to do is to pay this difference of thirty odd dollars out of my own pocket, and make money, or at least quiet, by the operation. But I must do this very secretly; for I will do them both the credit of believing that they would sooner pay the amount twice over than have it come out of my pocket: knowingly they would never accept such a settlement, and would resent the offer. Honest men they are, though obsti- nate; and each must be made to believe that the other has acceded to his terms, and then they will be friends- again, and bother me no more." Now, though, as we have seen, Freeborn Gomery was 'a man of most "incorrigible and losing honesty," it must be 'confessed that the course he had resolved 1upon was clearly unprofessional. He did not, even in his own mind, assuI e that he was acting from any high nnd magnanimous motives, or that, for the good of otherS, ]he was sacrificing his own interest. He never thoutght of pacifying or tickling his con- science in any such way. In fact, he was one of those men without a conscience. At least, if he had one, it never trou- bled him. As a man in robust health, and perfect digestion is scarcely conscious that he has such a thing as a stomach, so a manxwho only sees his duty, and thinks no more of it, but does it as a matter of course, never knows that he has an accus- ing conscience within him. Lawyer Gomery thought that he could secure comfort and ease to himself at a cheap rate by the practice of a little unprofessional deception; and as nobody else would be injured by it, but, on the contrary, two of his neighbors Would be benefited, he;-resolved to carry it into effect. Other members of the bar might call it unprofessional; but their opinion was of small account to him, as lie desired ' to be quit of their company and profession. He had incurred " much ill-will from them already; for he had counselled con- f., . , ,                   s   I  A FAMLY HSTORY..        ll cession and arbitration, and thus induced many contestants to consent to a reference, by which means many cases,- giv- ing promise of rich pickings, were compromised before they ever came before -the courts. 'Some of the more rapacious and hawk-like lawyers" would have gladly had him expelled firom the courts, or, in legal parlance, " thrown over the bar.": If that would have only put an end to his practice, he would 'have thanked them for such manifestation of?their apprecia- tion and regard; but, as people whio did not know him might construe the act to his discredit, he thought the wiser course was, not to unnecessarily provoke the anger of his profes- sional bretfiren, but, in cases like this of Craig and Cook, not to let his right hand know what his left hand was doing. The crafty. lawyer, having weighed the matter well, decid- ed on this course; and, in order to get rid of the troublesome business as soon as, possible, he sent a note to Cook to come up to his house the next day at four o'clock, and get his money, but not to mention the subject to any of his neigh- bors. Craig received a similar message, but was to attend an hour later. Both were punctual on this occasioh, if never before. : Cook, coming first, asked how he had "managed to make that obstinate old critter foik over." Gomery-replied, it was better for him to pay fifteen dollars, without going to law, than spend two hundred, and perhaps get nothing at last. "Get nothin": I guesss he wouldn't. He'd had -to pay at least' fifty dollars, and the costs of the court too. Me and my wife, we talked it over; and both said, if I hadn't prom- ised to talie the fifteen dollars, we'd got fifty, certain, by goin' to law. My wife is a very high-spirited woman, Square; and she hates Craig and Craig's wife; and Lucy, she says, is a proud, stuck-up minx, and wonders Caleb Thornton hain't got more sense than to have such' a silly thing." "Ill this way is she showing her new heart?" mildly sug- gested Gomery.  : "Square GOmery, I respect you as a man and a lawyer; but of spiritual things you know no ;more than a child Un- born. The saints have trials as well as sinners; andI in this we know we are of the elect."   .      J -"Conclusive reasoning," said the lawyer with a shrug. "But this meeting is for business, not to talk religion, When we get our business relations arranged, we are in a smuch .      ' .  *  .

Now, you get all you claim that Craig owes you; and the best thing you can do is for you to make up and be friends again, and promnise me not to open the subject with him again. Let biy-gones be by-gones." "Of course, Square: I agree to that. As he has done what is reasonable, I shall be very glad to forget and forgive. But it will bhe mighty hard for me to sit at communion with him."  '  "And why.?9  "Because he has done me great injustice, and has said things that were untrue about me and my family; and has, in many things, shown himself my enemy.". "Neighbor Cook, what is the object of your church comT munion?"  "Object, Square!- object! I am astonished you should ask that question. Ain't it ordered in Scripter? and musn't we obey Scripter? and shall we not follow its commandments,. if we are not bound to the place where the fire is not quenched and their worm dieth not? But you don't believe in Scripter; that is, no, I don't mean that you are a heathen. But what would be the use of Scripter'if there ain't no hell torments; if we are all goin' to heaven? If we are all goin' to heaven whether or no, what is the use of preachin' and praying and goin' to meetin', and buildinm meetin'-houses? We don't make nothin' by it."

"Yes; that is, the most of them,- all but -Craig; and, now he has done what is about right, I shan't be obstinate. But I wouldn't have taken a cent less." "' What other enemies have you?" ' "Well, I don' know. Don' know as I 'ave got any." "Theln you only love your friends; and the publicans and sinners do that! What thanks have you, then, for that?"

"But many others-as honest, as devotional as you, taught by their priests and bishops - see many things in it in a very different light."  "Why, Square, I an astonished at, your ignorance! -- you, a man that has read and studied so much as you! It is just as it is writ in,the Bible; and that, we know, is true; for it says so. It'says all scripter is given by inspiration." ' What is meant by that word ' scripture'?" "The Bible, of course. Why, I am out of patience with your ignorance!"  ' "I know it's unfortunate to be so ignorant; but let: us ex- amine. 'Scripture' is frdm the Latin word scripta, and means 'writings.' Now, you don't pretend that all writings are true?" "No, not that: only the Bible." "But, when that passage was written, much of the Bible had not been. Is it only that part, then, which was written before that passage you have quoted?" -'Don't you believe the Bible, Square Gomery?'?" "I believe that Jesus Christ had a divine commission. The record of his life is enough for me. No man of mere human will and power ever spake and-did as he. His life was a living sermon; and, if I imitate him to the best of my weak nature, I will leave the rest to God." "And don't you believe in the savin' grace?"' - "Saving from what?" ' "Savin" from hell, to be sure?' "I thought that Christ's mission was to save people from theit -sins: :but I find thatm nany of his-professed' followers o*                    - O  ,*   "4      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: regard his blood as a sufficient atonement for, themselves, and all who think and believe as they do; Band go on hating their enemies, and cheating their friends, even worses than the infi- del.

"-You are getting too personal." "Perhaps I an m; and, before we go farther, you sign this receipt, and herie is the fifteen dollars." Cook put his name to the receipt, and took the money, and deposited it in his heajrt-case purse, which he returned to his trousers-pocket. He had hardly done this when a knock was heard at the door; -and, in answer to the lawyer's "Come in," the door was opened, and Craig entered. The farmer shook hands heartily with the lawyer, but did not even notice the presence of the blacksmith, who, having his money already in his pocket, was not unwilling to r'iceive friendly advances. As Cook did not offer to leave, but was determined to show that he would not give wayfto accommodate his surly neigh- bor, the lawyer invited the last comer into an adjoining room, and, having closed the door, wrote a receipt in full for all de- mands against Cook; and, counting down seventeen dollars in money, requested Craig to sign the paper. The latter readily complied, and inquired how it was that he had induced that f wrong-headed, stubborn old sinner to do such an act of justice. "Oh! you never mind how," said the lawyer. "You have got your money, and: that is enough. Your quarrel has set the whole town by the ears; and, to stop it, I have endeavored to reconcile you; and if you are going to continue it, then it is the last time I shall ever interfere in behalf of either of youl." "' Don't talk 'so hard, Square. I am ready to make up with Brother Cook." -  "Then promise me never to allude to-this subject to him. Just consider the whole thing at an end, and never allude to it again." "I'll do it, Square; and now allow me to say that I think you have saved us both from a great piece of folly. XI shall be grateful to you as long as I live."  , *        .   A FAMLY HSTORY.  .   ' -  115 The lawyer here opened the door, and led the way back into the front office, followed by Craig, who now, for the first time, seemed to be aware of Cook's presence. The money that was jingling in his pocket had an effect more potent than Thompson's eye-water; for the scales at once fell from his eyes, and he ,saw clearly. The sanie medicine worked equally well in both cases; and after giving each othbr a friendly recognition, and shaking hands hnost fraternally, the following interesting dialogue took place:   ' . "How do you do, Brother Coolk?" "  "How do you do, Brother Craig?" l "Your folks are all well, I hope, Brother Cook."'  "Tolerably well, I thank' you, Brother Craig; though my wife is but poorly. She has not been able to go to meetin' but twice for four months."      - "That is very bad, Brother Cook; for Brother Millson has been preachin' some excellent sarmons lately: that you know. -I wish that the Square here would go to our church instead of runnin' after those poor itinerants that have to preach in the schoolhouse.- I think he would be a better man, and a Christian: besides, it would be more respectable, and he would get a good deal more practice. I think you would make a great deal by it if you would only become a Christian." "I have more practice now than it pays me-to attend to," quoth the lawyer, a little piqued at the summary way these two saints assigned him a place outside of the pale of Chris- tianity; "and, if I come short in my daily life and conversar tion, I shall be the sufferer by it. But, so long as my owi conscience is clear, I have no doubt or fear in trusting myself to Him who has ever shown himself sotkind and beneficent a Being, and, above all, has given me a heart appreciative and thankful for all his blessings. 5   ' * Ten thousand thousand precious gifts My daily thanks employ; Nor is the least a cheerful heart, That tastes these gifts with joy.' " "I know, Square, you have been a very fortunate man, and have been wonderfully blessed in the things of this world.  But you should remember how it was with Dives. He had his good: things in this life; and in the next hew lifted up: his   "6    -   oOMERY OF MONTGOME1TY  eyes, being in torment, and prayed for one drop of water to cool his tongue."                    . "And what evil had Dives done on earth?" "He was rich; and the .Bible says that it shall be easier for a camel to pass through' the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven." "And yet you two men, in your eagerness to get rich, - to be as Dives, -have been willing to tear out each. other's eyes; the reward of which, if you succeed so as to fare sump- tuously every day, will be to be broiled in the future world on the Devil's kridiron.") "The unregenerate heart don't understand the mystery of these things," said Craig. "'Great is the mystery of godli- ness J            . "And those that can't understand this mystery are to have r the fate of Dives, are they?" "They could understand if they would. If they would have faith, and believe,l the Spirit would come to them." - "How are they to, have faith without reason? You tell me there is a great mystery; that only the converted can see the truth, and the truth makes free; and then the old things pass away, and the old Adaramis put off. But I don't eBieIas the outer life of the saints, who profess to have cruci- fied the carnal man, is such as to lead a looker-on to suppose they are specially favored of Heaven. And the God they worship seems to be rather a cruel anid unrelenting despot than the kind, good Being who gives us so many blessings. The Devil that you fear seems to be a far better being than the God 'you profess to love. To me the God of Nature is the God of grace." "The God of Nature is the Devil," said Craig. ," A very good Devil we have, then," said the lawyer. ' He gives us so many blessings, let us be thankful to him. Glory to the Devil!  '"Mr. Gomnery, it is wicked for you to talk so; and I won't hear it. Good-by, sir. You are a very good lawyer, and I don't deny but you are afn honest and just man: but you are a wolf, - a wolf in sheep's clothini, - an emissary of Satan; and I won't talk with you any more." "How much are you goin' to charge for this business?" iked Cook.    - ' 'Of course he won't charge any thing," said Craig. "He ain't done nothin', hain't sued nobody nor nothin'."     i FAMWTLY HSTORY,       ,17 "But then," answered the lawyer, "the case has given me a great deal -of trouble, and .taken up a good deal of my. time; and, besides, I have served you much better than-I could had either of you brought sut. - Hmust charge you five dollars each."  ' "Five dollars!" exclaimed Craig in amazement; " five dol. lars! 'tis extortion."               ; "'Tis too much," said Cook.  "Five dollars; not a cent less," said the lawyer. ^ Craig, with an ill grace, took out five dollars from the money the lawyer had just given him, and, looking at it most wishfully for some moments, finally laid it on the table. Cook followed his example. "Square Gomery," said Craig, buttoning up his coat, and planting his hat 'firmly on his head, "Square Gomery, I consider this charge an imposition, and nothing less than rank extortion; and I want to tell you that this is the last time you will ever do any business for me."-  "I say the same," joined in Cook. "But I want my receipt, Square," said Craig. "So do I," said Cook. "Ah! they are in the other room. You may as well leave them with me. I shall keep them safe; and they can be pro- duced at any time, if needed." "No, sir," said Craig sternly. "I want my receipt. I shall have no nmore to do with y'ou."  The lawyer'.went into the other room, and brought out the papers, and gave them to their respective claimants. With,- out reading- them again, and never having observed the pe- culiar wording, each folded his receipt, .and put it in his pocket. "After this, Square," said Craig, " you need& never expect any more business from one client at least." "From two," said Cook. "Very well: I hope it may be so. Good-evening, gentle- men." The lawyer turned to his desk, and left his angry clients to withdraw at their pleasure. He was rather pleased to 'have turned their anger against himself, as now they would not be likely to talk about the manner ini which their own difficult'es had been arranged, The lawyer could not restrain himself from laughing when his angry neighbors and clients had leftg him to his own re-         I *  '   "8      GOMERY O  MONTG OMERY   :  flections. Their threats, that they would never give him any more of their valuable business, pleased him greatly; and his only fear *as that they would not keep their word, both in regard to that and the terms on which the settflement had been effected. "But if,' said he to himself, "they should ever learn that the imoriey they have paid me as fees is only a part of what I have advanced from my own pocket to save them from their own folly, it may teach them a lesson of charity." Thus saying he dismissed the subject from his- mind, and went out to his comrn-field, ancd began hoeing with his boys.   A 'FAMT MY HSTORY.        119 CHAPTER X. For forms of faith let graceless zealots fight: J His can't be wrong whose life is in the right." - POPE. As soon as the wronged and indignant victims of irreli- gious cupidity found themselves in the street, they joined in harmonious execration of the unjust lawyer; and the hate that a little before they had felt towards each other was' now allowed to flow in one common stream   of abuse of Gomery of Montgomery. How is it that a .-common object of hate often makes men friends, while a common object of love makes them envious and jealous,-haters '.and revilers of one another?  'Cook had come up to the Pivot on foot, while, Craig had come in his old one-horse wagon; and, as they were both going back to the villagcre, the latter said, "Brother Cook, will you ride with me? I am going right by your shop, and then I am going to the mill to get a grist I left there as I came along." Nothing loath, his neighbor got into the wagon; and away the lazy old horse jogged toward the village. On their way, they!said they would go to the post-office and get their papers that they supposed had arrived .that afternoon. The office was kept in Caleb 'Thornton's store, which was the principal one in the place; and this evening, as it happened to be Satu day, an unusual nu/nber of people were collected in and around it. As is generally the-case in and about country villages, Saturday afternoon was the time when the heads of families sought a little relaxation and recreation by resorting to the centre of news; politics, and religion, and discussing all these subjects with their neighbors, at the same time that they purchased their groceries and small stores for, the family consumption. In thesediscussions, not a few used to get the aid of John Barleycorn to help out their causes; , * ,  '  -    , -  ..  "  '  . '. ^ , ,    t'20     GOMERY OF, MONTGOMERY :- and, when inspired by that " hero bold,'" they not only often waxed eloquent, but not unfrequently were carried home with broken heads and other wounds received in the form of knock-down arguments. - On this particular. occasion, the crowd in the village was uncommonly large, even for a Saturday; and great was the astonishment when they saw Brother Craig and Brother Cook drive up in the same wagon. They had all known that the two had been on very bad terms for several weeks, and that each had threatened to have justice from the other if it took the last dollar of his property;-and their kind friends were expecting a fine feast of scandal and excitement when the two worthies should get mixed up in:the dread uncer- tainties of the law; and each was trying to keep the other in front of him on the road to ruin. It was evident, at a glance, that they were to be disappointed; and as soon as the two had gold out of thewagon, and had separated a little distance from each other, Tom Bryan, who had been a great partisaan of Craig, took him aside, and asked himr how it was that they so easily settled their difficulties. Craig replied that Cook was not so unreasonable, after all, but had come down from his high horse; and, when he made hiin an offer, he acted like a brother Christian, and accepted it ;and they had made -all up, and passed receipts. "But,"' said he, "Cook had to yield. I had my way; and, if he hadn't knuckled under, I never would have settled without puttin' him through a course of , law. But don't say any thing about it." Cook hadmade a similar statement to Bion Teague, one of his partisans, saying that Craig had-shown himself a man, and had yielded all pretension that the balance was in his favor, being convinced that he was in, the wrong. His con- duct now had proved him to be the same good Christian and brother that he had thought him for years; and his con- duct in this case showed the effect of severe religious doc- trine on a man's life, since 'it contrasted strongly with that of the unbelieving Gomery of Montgom ry, who had been i so unjust, and extortionate as to chargei them five dollars each for doing nothing but talk over the matter, when they might just as well have talked it over among themselves. Each brother warmly commended the other for giving way, and both spoke of the lawyer as a heathen and extor- tioner. ,!   A FAMLY HSTORY.        121 But, unfortunately, the two friends of the respective par. ties, when they came together, fell to talking on the same matter; and, naturally, Lawyer Gomery's scheme of adjust- ment must come out, and, of-course, must cause a great ex- plosion.     ; I'I didn't think old Craig would back down quite so meek- ly,9 said Teague. "Still, I always knew he was a great brdg; always talking of what he is going to do, but never doing it." "He didn't back down at all," sharply retorted Bryan. "He just told; me so."  "Yes, he did: he backed clean out. Cook just told me- that he made his terms, and gave them to Squile Gomery; and that Craig acted like a inan, and came up handsomely  and settled on them terms, and so admitted he had been in  the wrong. But," he said, "the lawyer had played 'em a scurvy trick'; for, though he did nothing, hescharged 'em five dollars apiece. I've long thought Gomery was no 'better than other folkis, for all that they ale always telling what an honorable man he is. I've thought so ever since he took Brown's part agin me five years ago, when I lost, and had to- sell off part of my land. Now I know it. But here conies the man himself.-- Mr. Cook, I say: Bryan says that you / backed down, and came to Craig's terms, and paid him his monev." "Didn't back out at all, Teague. Brother Craig yielded to my terms, and it was on the terms I gave to the .Square that we, settled; and I've got the money now, all but what Gomery grabbed away from me. So there was no backing out on my part. I would have spent the last cent I have ' in the world before I would have backed down a single inch, much regard as I have for Brother Craig. Here he comes , now.-- Brother Craig, these fellers will have it that I backed out about the lawsuit. I promised Gomery to say nothing about it: but you can just tell them that it was no such thing; that you, finding yourself in the wrong, bame to my terms, and paid the balandce due me." "But I didn't do no such thing. It was you that come to my terms. You know I never back down: I only ask what is right, and that I will have; for I never submit to any thing that is wrong."  "I didn't think that- of yoi, Mr. Craig:i you know you backed down."     122      GOMERY, OF MONTGOMERY; "You backed down yourself.'" "That is a lie!" Whack! was the answer of Brother opk, as' his heavy fist flew up and hit the affectionate cheek of Brother Craig a blow, at, which he reeled, and would have fallen but for the crowd, that, as the conversation had waxed warm and inter- esting, had gathered close around the angry disputants. In- stead of turning his other cheek to his erring brother, he drew up his own brawny arm to strike back, but was re- strained by the spectators. "I say you are a liar, Mr. Cook!" he roared out; for his tongue was not pinioned, though his arms were. "You backed out, and you knorw you did; and I have got your , receipt in my pocket." "And I have got yours too; and you -paid me seventeen dollars to square accounts; and you have been braggin' that I owed you seventy or eighty dollars, and would sue me if I didn't pay you."      ' "I didn't pay you 'seventeen dollars, neither. You paid me fifteen; and only last week you said you wouldn't take a cent less than seventy-five." "Here is the receipt," said Craig, drawing a paper from his pocket, '"Writ in Square Gomery's handwriting. Read that, Mr. Bryani, and tell us if it ain't so." Bryan took the paper, and read:.-- "Received, this October 14, 183-, by hand of Freeborn Gormery, on account of Jabez Craig, fifteen dollars, iln full of all demands.           ,  "EVI COOK.'" "But I never paid the seventeen dollars," said Craig in surprise, not having observed befole that Cook's receipt wais so worded."  "And I never paid the fifteen 4dollars," said Cook in his turn, drawing forththe receipt which lhe had received from the lawyer, with Craig's signature to it. "I now understand why the lawyer wanted us to leave the receipts with him. He was mean enough to charge us five dollars apiece for doing nothing, and- wanted to keep our receipts besides.", "Then the Square has miade up the, difference," said little Diller, the landlord of the tavern, who, like the stormy petrel, always delighted to be inithe midst of a tempest.( "He found   A FAMMTTY HSTORY.        123 you were a couple of such bull-heads, that you would ruin yourselves in order to ruin each other. You,wanted to bite off your noses to spite your, faces. Pretty-looking fellers you'd be without noses. So, to save your pretty mugs, Gomery of Montgomery has paid overl thirty odd dollars; and yet you are abusing him for charging ten dollars fees." Brother Craig looked at Brother Cook. Brother Cook looked at Brother Craig. "Did you," said he, "pay Square Gomery fifteen dollars for ne?" "No: I received seventeen dollars from him on your account."  "Well, then, it was because he knew you was an unjust man, a mean old skin-flint, and didn't want me to go to law and waste my property on suchcal'in." "Don't talk so to me, Mr. Craig! You are a liar!" Here the two were on the point of coming to blows again; when a third brother got between them, and said, "Let us have no fighting. It is all the fault of these lawyers. It is only a device of Satan to bring scandal upon us, and make a breach in the church."- "I think," said a stranger who chanced to be present, " you have a queer kind of a lawyer -here."  "I- He is a great rascal!" said Cook. "That is false," said Simeon Carter, the head stopkman of the sawmill. "'It is false, I say; and any man that says any thing agin Squire Gomery is a liar; and I'll fight him, if he dares!"  "You are right," said Caleb Thornton, who now, for the first time, interposed. "These men are angry with him for saving them from foolish and expensive litigation at his own expense. - Isn't it so?," he continued, turning to them. "You get into a quarrel; and he spends not only time and money to reconcile you, and yet you abuse him. - Now, I have a proposition to make. It is that you refund the thirty odd dollars that Gomery of Montgomery has paid to save you from ruin, and then that you go right to law, and fight it out. I have got a thousand dollars in my store that I want to put out at interest; and I will lend five hundred to each of you, and take mortgages on your property; and, when you have spent that in law, I will let you have more;, and then, ,'        .        '    124      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: in a couple of years"or so, I will get Craig's farm, and Cook's house and shop, and you will both get law and justice." "Good!" shouted several. "1 That's the way to do, eat each other up." - Brother Cook did not raise his eyes again, but walked deliberately away to his shop. Brother Craig got into his wagon, and, looking neither to the right nor left, drove directly home. , When these two came to reflect upon their conduct, it may well be supposed they were more heartily ashamed of themselves than they ever had been' before in all their lives; and, as soon as it was-lark, Cook, who intended to be scru-, pulously honest and fair in all his dealings,- a good citizen;, a hard-working, blunt, honest blacksmith, whose work was never 'slilghted,-stole quietly forth from his house, and at about eight Ao'clock his knock was heard at the door of' the' big house at the Pivot. Being bid to enter, he went in ; and, as soon as he opened the door of the parlor, his eyes fell on the smilingly incredulous,face of the beautiful Mrs. Gomery, who to his eyes looked no less fair than she did many years before, when he had first seen her, a young bride, soon after her arrival at her new home. She was sitting in a larrge rocking-chair, holding a child of some Six- or eight months oltl on her lap, which she was dandling and chattering to, looking the very picture of matronly content and joy. The arrival of this younger scion of the house of Gomery was recorded at the close of the last chapter. He had been named Walter, after his grandfather, old Judge Mackenzie, who, about ayear before, had departed on his final journey to the unseen land. Mrs. Gomery looked. up from the smil- ing, heathy little face that lay thus in its natural cradle; and her knowing and pleasant look made the blacksmith feel more confused and ashamed tiin ever. But when in an instant he saw Craig was there before him, standing with his purse in his hand, and counting out some money to the lawyer, he took courage, and said,-- "I must pay back too. I have been very much to blame, Square; but I am a man that pays his debts, and tries to live honestly. Here is the fifteen dollars." - "I only want ten from you, as I :have taken only twelve from Mr. Craig. I shall only take back what I have paid out; and if by my services I have saved two of my neighbors, i  /  '  '            '   *  '   A FAMLY HSTORY.        125 whom I have always respected, from a long and serious law- suit, I shall consider myself well paid for my trouble." I  Neither could say a word in reply to this; and, though Mrs. ;4ipJ / Gomery tried to get some words from them in regard to their SI  family matters, they felt so-awkward and confused, that they !:wi  directly withdrew. When outside of the door, they stood on the steps a moment, feeling about as guilty and ashamed as it may be supposed they would have felt if caught stealing sheep. They were even ashamed to begin "brotheling" each other; and so, without saying a word, they went separately to their respective homes. The conduct of Gomery of Montgomery in this affair, :though characteristic, was so entirely unprofessional, that the little business that he had retained, up to this time against his will, abruptly fell off. Ii fact, it seemed to put a total stop to all litigation in that town for the next two years; so that Clofton, when his board bill at Diller's would bear' no longer extension, was obliged to leave. He left' the place with a bad impression of the character of the people, and f said they were the meanest-spirited set he ever saw; ; for there was not a man among them who had the pluck to stand up for his rights, if it were to costO him four and sixpence. The case was a standing joke for a long time; and no one seemedA to enjoy it more after a little while than Craig and Cook, and they could never meet each other for a year after with- out inquiring one of the other when he was intending to commence that lawsuit. Whenever there happened to be- any dispute between neighbors, and either threatened to go to law, it was only necessary to propose to refer it to Gomery of Montgomery; and such resort would appear so ludicrous and absurd, that no one had the assurance to insist upon it. So, instead of going to law to get damages for the mischief done by a breachy cow, or compel a settlement of long stand- ng accounts at an expense most likely exceeding the whole amount in dispute, the disagreeing parties were in a manner compelled by the public sentiment to leave. it out to either one or three disinterested persons, 'who would not-charge nlore than half a dollar each for sitting in judgment, and who, if they gave original law, generally gave old-fashioned justice. The ,case of Craig and Cook became a by-word in this town, and was as frequently alluded to as in after-years ,    .                  .   126      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY:         . was the famous case of Dred Scott in the, halls of Congress. To Lawyer Gomery it proved an advantage entirely unantici- pated. After that he 1wVas not disturbed by his friends and neighbors coming to him with their complaints. He was thenceforth regarded as an oracle of wisdom, and respected too much for any one to think of annoying him with his petty troubles.           ,   A- FAMLY HSTORY,        127 l  CHA PTER   XI, Where yet was ever found a mother Who'd give her booby for another?"- GAY. THE family of Gonery of Montgomery, consisting now of two daughters and three sons, was naturally enough the principal object of the father's care and solicitude. The two daughters were just emerging from the state of girlhood, and gave promise of being as fair a" their mother had been at the time she had captured their fortunate father. They were somewhat hoidenish at this age, and delighted to take part in the -rough :out-door sports of their brothers. They had- never attended any school but the public school of the -vil- lage; and, as the Pivot was a long mile from the school- house, they had a good invigorating walk every morning and evening, if the weather was hir; but, if not, the old man- servant, Ethan Hurd, who had lived with them ever since they could remember, would harness up old 4"Barnacle" in the winter to a lumber-box, and in the summer to a- low-cov- ered wagon, and drive them to and from the schoolhouse. "Barnacle " was an old horse that knew enough to make him- self the pet of the children, and thereby secure many- a savory morsel, many sweet apples, and many nibs of corn; and, in re- turn for these toothsome dainties, he allowed them to play all manner of tricks with him; to ride two or three at once; 'to pull his tail, and crawl between his legs.. He never resented these liberties-further than gently to raise one hind foot and hold it up, as much as to say, "-I could if I would, and you had better take care." The name of this venerable beast had been bestowed on him by an occasional Visitor to Montgom- ery Village, who had a great propensity to roam-about the old house on the hill, and talk of the strange events of its early history. He was a isort of vagabond sailor, and pre- tended to have been all over the world. He was a stout,                      ,    128      GOM-ERY OF MONTGOMERY : broad-shouldered, powerfully built man, active and athletic, with eyes bright and merry, and a nose the bridge of which had once been broken, so that his nostrils opened directly in front, and looked more like two worm holes in a board than the olfactories of a, human face. But the extreme humor that was ever flowing from his mouth served well to divert attention from his strange-lookingnose; for he could tell stories and sing songs for hourls, and his fund would seem in- exhaustible; and he had always a joke or repartee with which to interlard his conversation and silence cavillers. Tile name of this singular character was Joe Pumpagin, though few peo- ple knew him by any other cognomen than "Old Joe." But he was not old when he first was known in the village, 'and at the present time -he might have been taken for any!age be-- tween thirty-five and fifty. Lawyer Gomery, at this time, though frequently called the " old Squire," or more frequently "Square," was, nevertheless, but little past forty; and, if I were to guess, I should say that old Joe was his senior by five or six years., Both Freeborn Gomery and his wife had always intended to give their children a better education than could be ac-, quired in thle- schools of the. village; and, the summer preced- ing the events narrated in the last chapter, the two daughters had been sent away to a neighboring academy, distant some fifty miles from Montgomery. This institution deservedly enjoyed a high reputation; and the letters that the parents received from their daughters showed that they had put awy for the time all thoughts of gayety and romping play, and were studying with all desirable enthusiasm and ardor. These letters were not of the balls and parties they would miss by being at school, and which they had,so much enjoyed the winter before, but of arithmetic and algebra, of natural philosophy, geography, and the French language, of drawing and English composition. Juliet, the elder of the two, com- plained a-great deal of the difficulty of'the latter; for she said that the preceptor gave them subjects of which she could think of nothing to say that she could not find bet- ter said in books, and which the preachers were not always saying in their sermons. One time. the subject would be the beauties of summer; another, the pleasures of winter; again they would -be required to write on: hope; then again on youth; on virtue, temiperance, and so on, when she didn't I *'   A FAMLY HSTORY.         129 care to say a word on any of them. Rose, however,-.the younger of the sisters, who had more ingenuity, - would put the title assigned at the head of her theme, and then go off in a tangent to express what she had to say on any thing else. When the novel subject, Hope, was given out, she began by saying she hoped to have again such a jolly time as-she re- membered at a bee for sliding down hill; and then she went off into a ludicrous description of the party, -. the upsets, the boys fighting, the whole party staying too late, when -her father came out with a stick in his hand, and drove his truant flock home like so many sheep.  It -was during the autumn that Juliet and Rose were at the academy for their 'lrst term, and about two -weeks after the great case of Craig and Cook had been arranged, that the long-time servant-maid of Mrs. Gomery was walking up and down, one bright morning near the last of October, in the back yard or court of the Pivot, and before the kitchen. door, bearing in her arms the youngest Gomery. The ser- vant's name was Prudence Dodge; and she was amusing her- self and' her charge by feeding the chickens, and singing scraps of hymns and songs that she had learned a great many years before.  The morning was beautiful, the sun warm and genial, and the air bracing and firesh, so as to cause all animated things to experience a pleasure in mere existence. While thus engaged, the discreet Prudence was startled .to hear, in a voice that sounded familiar, "It's a boy!" She turned, and standing before her was Kitty Floyd, the only daughter of the nearest neighbor of the Gomerys: "Of course it's a boy," said Prudence. "They wouldn't call a girl Walter, would they?    " "Oh h! I don't mean Walter. I mean Betsey Fabyan's-- baby.- I  met the doctor this morning as he was ;coming down the lane from  their house; and he said it was a boy, and mother and child were doing as well as could be ex- pected." "You don't say so!  Well, H dun'no. Betsey will be mighty proud now, I 'spect; and so will George.   Oh, I am so glad fior ern! because they are always so anxious the first time."  "And don't it beat it all? This makes five babies born in Montgomery this year since Fast Day. ,. I declare, it's quite discouraging!"   130      GOMERY OF' MONTGOMERY : "Pshaw! what do you know about these things, Kitty? You are only twenty years old yet; I ant past fifty: and I guess there will be a lot more afore Thanksgiving. Let me see: there is John Eckerman's wife has been married nearly a year; then Levi Chetwood's wife has hone every two years, and this is her year ; and the Widow Sawhuckle has been engaged already to nurse Mis' Sanderson; and I say, Kitty, I don't know what the world is coming to!" "Nor I nuther: there won't be a ,married woman in all our neighborhood to go to the Thanksgiving ball, and what a flat time it will be! I declare, I shouldn't wonder if they didn't have any Thanksgiving ball this year, because there will be so many babies. And poor Mr. Diller! I don't know what will become of him; for he 'has been and built a great piece on to his hall a-purpose for the Thanksgiving ball; and, after all, there won't be any;" and the tears welled up to the eyes of the poor girl. "Of course, there will be a ball. There always is: and Mr. Diller aren't afraid of the babies; for he has put an addi- tion of twenty feet to his hall, and has already sent clear to Tivernet to engage the music. Of course, we shall have our old leader, for nobody can play the fiddle like him; but Dil- ler has engaged another fiddler, a clarionet, and bass-viol from Tivernet. But why. do you take on so about it, Kitty? You are! always sure of the best partners, and a great many say you dance as well as Juliet Gomery." " Prudence, won't you tell nobody?" ' No." "For sure,-- never?" Certain, -for sure.'" "Now, I wouldn't have a soul know it but you for the wdrld." "Do tell me, then, if you want to keep it safe! I will never breathe a word!" "Well, then, ,you know Isabel Lott, what a proud silly thing she is?" "iYes: I know how she- has been trying to cut you out 'ith Joel Slocum. She must think her pretty face will do a good deal for her, when everybody knows what a temper she has got!" ", Well, she can't do it; for we are to be married Thanks- giving-day morning, - ha, ha!" ,                     ,     . \        .'    "    A FAMLY HSTORY.,       131 K "Kitty Floyd! you don't say so? Well, I do declare I I thought I know'd almost every thing; and this beats me. I do say, now, you have kept it dreadful secret. I guess Isa- bel Lott will be pretty well cut up when she hears it. Won't ,she sputter?^' I "Yes: we are to be married oil Thanksgiving morning, and we are to have Square Gornery to marry us; and then    we are to go to meeting and hear ElderMillson, for Joel's folks are that kind; and after that we are to go home and '    eat our Thanksgiving-dinner; and in the evening we sh'all go to the ball, and the next morning go over to Bridge- ville, where he is already getting Ihis house ready for us to live in ; and--oh, dear me! I am thinking so much about it, I can hardly catch my breath!"  "Well, Kitty, I'm mighty glad; for Mrs. Gomery says you are a good girl, and I say so too. And Joel Slocum is a very good man, and has property too, and is prudent and honest, and has a good business, and you will be as happy as two ducks; and the Square is to marry you, and you are to go to the ball in the evening! Ain't it too bad so many have got babies, so they can't go? '  -"Yes: it makes me so mad! -There, won't be anybody there to see my wedding-dress and theobosom-pin and brace- let that he is to give me for a wedding-present. And, of course, I sha'n't dance with anybody but Joel on my wedding- night; and there are only three or four married wolman in town that can 'go; for the rest; are too old, or have got -abies. And, oh dear! I know it will be so stupid! I know it will! It is too bad, and they ought to stop it!" "Hoity-toity, Kitty Floyd! They ought to stop it, had they? You are setting a fine example, going off' out of towi to marry Joel Slocum. You will sing another song, I guess, next year. Hoity-toity, I say'! A pretty time for you to talk about stopping it!"  During the time of this conversation between the youthful - Kitty and the mature Prudence, the young Gomery had been seated in his low chair that stood in the- doorway of the kitchen; for Prudence had got tired of holding him long before it had reached this point.- She'was startled now at hearing a sharp cry from him; and, turning'to look, saw him sprawl- ing on the floor, having fallen from his chair flat upon his face. She ran and caught him up again; but he cried as iftnearly   132  G' MERY OF'. MONTGOMERY: killed, though in half a minute he was laughing again in answer to the good-natured Condolences of Kitty.  The mother, having heard the infantile pipes playing, came hur- riedly to the rescue of her darling; but, before she had reached the scene, he was smiling, like Androtmache, through his tears. ".Good-morning, Kitty," said she, after first seeing that the child was unhurt. "How do your folks all do this morn- ing?" "Very well, I thank you. 'When did you hear from Juliet and Rose? I hope they are coming home before Thanks-, giving."             .  "No: they don't wish to come. I gojt a letter from Rose last night; and she says the examination will not take place till a week after Thanksgiving, and she wouldn't miss it for the world. She says she jexpects to get the first prize in dlrawing and history, and shall try for it in composition. And Juliet is sure of it in algebra and Latin; and, of course, they can't think of coming home before Thanksgiving.- Of course our daughters will take all the prizes -if they try." "Oh, dear! then I am so sorry! I was in hopes they would be here to attend the ball., There will be hardly anybody to go, because the girls are all married, and have got babies; and it will be so flat and stupid! But dear me!" she exclaimed, her 'eyes brightening, .why can't you go, Mrs. Gomery? We don't have any more such grand balls as we used to have when you and the Squire went. I was littler than I am now; but I remember turey all said that you danced more lightsome and better than all the girls in town. And, when you stopped going, a great many others stopped; for they said it wasn't fashionable. And then came the revival; and a, great many got religion, and said it was wicked to go to balls; and so, now, there will be hardly anybody to go." "My dancing days: are over, Kitty. But I will promise you one thing. When you get married, I will dance at your wedding."  .  Will you? certai,?" "I will, honest and sure." "What, if I get -married'this Thanksgiving, will you go -to the ball?" "I rill. I will, sure,:ifI am alive and well,'and Walter-is not sick.

'W ^Well, then, it is a bargain; for I am to be married on \   Thanksgiving-day morning." And the girl-laughed amerry, p ringing laugh; and, in her joy, the tears again came into her eyes. "Indeed, Kitty! Is that so?" "Yes, it is; and Mr. Slocum is getting his house ready at Bridgeville; and nobody knows it here but you and pa and ma. We had'it all arranged last Sunday evening, and here it is Tuesday morning; and I thought I should a' died all day yesterday, and I know I should a' died to-day, if I hadn't come up here to tell Prudence about it; and I was so afraid nobody would go to the ball, and it would be so stupid. And may I tell folks you are going?". , "Certainly; if you like. Ilshall tell them if you don't." "Oh, how glad I am! I guess there will be no holding back now, and everybody will want to go, and I am to be married; and, oh dear, how glad I am!"And the honest girl's eyes were now suffused with tears of joy. "Well, Kitty, my sweet girl, you are so rejoiced I will not fail you; and I know Mr. Gomlery will be as glad as I am to please you, for he always said you were one of the most sen- sible girls in the neighborhood. Good-morning, my good girl;" saying which, and taking her boy in her arms, she walked into the house. Kitty, left alone with- Prudence, did not attempt to repress or conceal her joy, but giggled and laughed and shook and hopped about like a child with a new rattle; and soon, bid- ding her friend- good-morning, she ran down the hill from the Pivot, as light as a fawn, to her own home, to tell her father aqd mother the good news.!A good girl was Kitty Floyd,-- an affectionate, dutiful daughter She knew how to make a pudding or roast a turkey, and do, all' those thou- sand'and one things that,tend so much to make home agree- able.

"O God I the thought forgive,.- - If 'twere not for my cat and dog, I think I could not live," 12'                     '   134       GOMERY OFZ MONTGOMERt: The glad tidings that Kitty bore home from the Pivot soon spread through the town, and before night it was in everybody's mouth that the next Thanksgiving ball was, to be the grandest ever given in Montgomery; that Diller had enlarged his hall, at an expense of a hundred dollars, for the occasion; that extra music was to come firom Tivernet;- and finally, and most important of all, Gomery of Montgomery and his wife were to attend as in days of yore. As the story rolled, it increased like a snowhall; for various other married folks, who had not been in the habit of attending balls of late years, said, on hearing the news, that they had, some time before, made up their minds to attend this one; to shake a foot just to encourage Diller for going to the expense of enlarging his hall. The next day the newspapers brought the governor's proc- lamation for Thanksgiving Day. It was later in the season than usual, and the people would have more than a month. to prepare for the .grand affair of the season. Little Diller was in- his element,. and so busy that he had time to do nothing. Not a guest came to his house but he told him of the expense he had been at to enlarge the hall of the Eagle. He always called his house the Eagle, for the reason that there was a picture 'of this bird of freedom, that wars on all other birdsl painted on the sign at the corner of the hollse. -But the other people of the village always. called it the Tav- ern. :Then he would add that Gomelry of Montgomery would attend; but if, unfortunately, the guest had never heard of that distinguished character--as was often the case, --and asked who and what he was, then Diller had such a contempt for him, that lie would waste no more words, but would stop his clatter, and attend to his business. If,. however, the traveller affected to know all about him, then' the delighted host would; regale him. with a long Account of the Gomery history, and tell of the great and rich relatives the family had in the great cities of the country; always adding that Mrs. Gomery might have had the richest heir of his day in all New England, but she preferred Gomery of Montgomery, which, in his opinion, showed she was a woman of good sen-se. But, in a village like, Montgomery, no man, no family, could be universally popular. The very eminence and influence of, the Gomery Family made them many enemies, - not open' ,    A FAMLY HSTORY.        135 and avowed enemies, but envious carpers, that would have been rejoiced to see them humbled and dethroned. And ,neither Gomery nor his wife courted popularity. They had for their intimates and particular friends such as pleased them; and several of the poorer sort of women were invited to tea- drinkings at the Pivot, to which others of more pretensions  ! and property were never bidden. The squire's most intimate associate was an old pensioner, named Tench Wales, who eked out liis living by cobbling shoes. He and his wife were a queer couple; for he was the best-informed man in the county, not excepting even the lawyer; and the old woman was a living history of New England, and could tell of every important incident that ever happened, from the land- ing of the Pilgrims to the- great case of Craig and Cook; having a. memory for names and dates, that, at an earlier period, would have proved her a witch, without contradic- tion or doubt. It was a sight to see this worthy couple, each with big horn spectacles on nose, trudging up the hill of an afternoon to the Pivot, from which they would return late in the evening in the squire's best carriage, driven by that reliable and sober Jehu, Ethan Hurd. -The variety of sub- jects discussed,and the history narrated,. could it be given in this book, would form a, much better chapter than any I have written; but it 'Would not be pertinent to my story, and I will not attempt it. The children were all more anxious to sit up late when Wales and his wife were. visitors; for they said the talk was more, interesting than on other occasions. Joe Pumpagin was the particular friend of Wales and his wife; and, whenever Diller began to hint that he would like a sight of his money, Joe would tell him he would not pat- ronize his house any longer, and go and quarter himself on Wales, where he was always welcome, and never dunned for pay. There was nothing in the manner or disposition of Free- born Gomery or his wife to repel intimacy of the most cordial kind 'with their neighbors; and, when they were' first married, they sought to make the acquaintance of all, and put them on a level of familiarity and friendship but in time, when they came to know people better, they found some that they liked better than others; and they chose for intinmates those they could sympathize with, paying small regard to their worldly circumstances. Nor did political or re-   136      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY : ligious differences ever interfere with their preferences. They found some of every party and sect in town, for whom they had a particular liking; and so it happened that,the envy or jealousy that some people felt towards them could never assume a partisan or sectarian form. It was necessarily en- tirely of a social character; and, notwithstanding the great , liberality of the two, it must be admitted, that, on more than one occasion, the high spirit of the Mackenzies broke forth in a manner that showed a conscious sense of superiority on the part of the woman, little calculated to flatter the vanity or win the love of those who had 'excited it.' In matters of general interest, in affairs of politics or re- ligion,-she was always calm, complacent, and yielding;- but, in regard to her husband or children, she was as sensitive as i a lioness with her young. She was in many respects dif. ferent from and in some the 'antipodes of him; but she loved him most strongly for those points of character that con. trasted most clearly with her, own. In appearance, even, they exhibited a strong contrast. Though both were large of frame, and even stately in appearance, there seemed a con- trast between them in every'other respect. He was a man of strong rough features, with a firm iron frame; and, though as far as possible from a plain man, his features were such, that they might e 'bbst described by the expression, " whole- some ugly." His nose was prominent and slightly aquiline, his cheek-bones high, his complexion ruddy, his hands and feet large; and yet there was such a lively expression to the eye, and such a general beaming of good nature about his entire appearance, that it was encouraging to a shy, and sooth- ing to an' alarmed man to look at him. -His wife, on the other hand, had features regular and symmetrical, a complexion exceedingly fair, and large blue eyes that seemed as inex- haustible and comprehensive in their effulgence as the blue vault of heaven. He was a man of a thoughtful, intellectual cast of mind, an omnivorous reader, fond of a sermonizing kind of talk, and without ambition. In every thing he acted as he did, not from, calculation or chance, but because he could not help it. 'A sense of duty impelled him in every thing; and it would have been as easy for him to have cotn- mitted burglary or highway robbery as to have overcharged a client, or taken advantage in a bargain. There were in his mind, for himself, no degrees of crime, no shades of sin.    , -    .      ^-   A FAMLY HSTORY.         137 If an act were right, he performed it; if it were wrong, he could not do it. It was impossible; and to this man, that never realized that he had a conscience, there could be no temptations  Such were the natures and dispositions of Gomery of Montgomery and his wife; arid, being so, it needed no disci- ple of Gall or Combe to foretell that the children would be of uncommon promise. There existed that contrast between the parents that physiologists insist upon as most likely to produce the highest orderi of mind and body in the pro- geny. He was the more intellectual and robust; she the more beautiful and sensitive. He was the morb refiec- tive; she the more energetic. He the more humorous; she the more sprightly. He fonder of books and politics; she of admiration and deference. He acted only because he must; she for an object and purpose.  He had more strength of character; she more ambition. The children inherited the better qualities of both their parents, taking after their mother in personal appearance and energy, and /' after their father in mental scope, and facility of learning; but, though all showed the effects of such a fortunate mix- ture of opposites, the boys all inclined more to the father, .- while the girls more resembled the mother, having allnher symmetry of feature, at' the same time that they inherited the intellectual tastes of their father. An incident is related, and was long current in the village (having occurred when her first-born was only six months old), as showing not only how early in their career she fore- saw the future eminence of her offspring, but how it was she raised a spirit of opposition and envy to her among those whom she wished to conciliate. Her early faith in the supe- riority of her children, expressed even before they could speak, or, to other minds than hers, give any evidence of their capacity, caused it to be said by some of the older heads, spitefully of course, that she had only married Gom- ery of Montgomery for the sake of the cross in the stock, when it was well known she might have had the only son of the richest man in Boston, whose yearly income was more than Gomery of Montgomery was ever worth, or ever likely to be. The incident happened at a tea-drinking.  Mrs. Gomery was then young, and'for the first time a mother, and as beautiful a woman as ever graced such a fes-   10 8      GOMEIRY OF MONTGOMAERY: tive ocdasion. As was the custom among those primitive people, poor unfortunates that did not .know any better, she had taken to the social gathering this first-fruit of her union with Gomery of Montgomery. Then, as at, a later period, the country in that vicinity was exceedingly healthy and ,prolific; .and it happened that the arrival of young strangers was so common an occurrence, that a tea-party at which several of them were not present with their nam- mas was never -known. On this occasion, there happened to be two others, besides Mrs. Gopnery, with their infantile treasures, and both about the age of little Juliet; and, as it was the first time the three had been brought together, the partial, fond, foolish mothers began comparingfeatures. 'Tis said that ugly babies make the -handsomest grown people. I do not believe it; yet it is certain, that, at that period, Juliet Gomery was not half so pretty as Eliza Th'trston.. Her cheeks, were full and plump, her nose undefined, her forehead high and broad, her chin and ,mouth irregular and uncornely. To offset these, she had blue eyes and a faultless complexion. The other baby, Eliza Thurstdn, had more reaular features, and its mother thought it much the prettier. Indeed, it was so at that time; but when the mother began to boast, and to say to a companion who sat near, both supposing that they were overheard, See! isn't it a beauty?.see what; pretty cheeks. what a sweet mouth!" and looking from her own child to young Juliet Gomery, then about three months old, and lying smiling, and biting its. fists, in a large arm-chair, "Isn't it," she continued, " a great deal prettier than that?"' Mrs. Gomery remained silent over her needle-work, though the fires of a thousand volcanoes Were agitating her bosom. But the other did not stop here; and, all unsuspicious of being overheard, she went on, "Yes: it is a thousand times prettier than that ugly little thing." Human nature could not stand this. Others besides Mrs. Gomery had overheard the doting, foolish words, and had foreseen that the tempest must break forth. - Woman!" said she, do you dare to compare your baby with mine  Simon Thurston's child with Gomery of Mongomery's? You are a  silly little fool! T he baby of such a light-head- ed goose as you- and your noodle of a husband to be com- pared with that of a man like my husband, and- a woman like me I My daughter shall be the belle of the country while !   A FAMLY HSTORY.         139 yours is angling for a wood-sawyer's clerk. She shall be the wife of a senator while yours will be glad to get a cant- ing parson on a salary of fifty dollars a year, and half the fish he can catch out of the river." Mrs. Thurston, poor, weak thing, dropped her eyes at this cruel speech'; and the tears began to fall as she clasped her child more closely to her bosom i It was a most ungener- ous and unmerited rebuke, and far severer, than her own idle, vain words deserved; but she had" no spirit to retort on so superior a person as the angry woman that stood be- fore helr, her eyes flashing fire, and her cheeks, a little before -so pale, now flushed and excited. The barbed arrow had sped, and it could not be withdrawn without still more-pain. Poor Mrs. Thurston stole fromn the room immediately, carry- ing her child with her; and, though others followed her, she could not be consoled, but, sobbing and heart-broken, left for her own home. There was no more pleasure nor gossip that night. The tea had been drunk before this sad climax, and the party soon broke' up. Mrs. Gomery repented of this cruel outhreak a thousand ; times. The memory of it was a drop of bitter in many a cup of sweet; and long years after, when it appeared that her words of anger were likely to be literally fulfilled, and her daughter came to be recognized as one of the most beau- tiful and brilliant women of her day and the wife of one of the leading metn of the nation, and Eliza Thurston became the wife -of a poor preacher'and the mother of several chil- dren, and was so poor that she was obliged to labor like a very drudge for their support, she remembered with bitter remorse her cruel words; and, though she could never hear the parson preach, she prevailed on her husband to contrib- ute more to his support than any other of his parishioners. Not to show partiality, however, he gave theA same amount to another preacher, for whose preaching both he and his wife had the sarte respect. This was Elder Millson, under whose, teachings for many- years sat Brother Craig and Brother Cook, --all of whom, while lamenting the spiritual darkness in which the so square " was groping, admitted that, though his faith was weak and- his creed lax, his works were emi- nently evangelical. ,'                    . The tradition of this scene at the tea-party was preserved with awe and envy, as a sort of moral pickle, by sundry peo-   "O      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY:  ple, who saw4 as year after year passed by, that the lawyer waxed rich, independent, and influential; and that, as each child was born to his house, it early in life gave signs of superior sprightliness and intelligence. As children,. they had more tact, more self-possession and innate refinement, than other children of the village. They were not more amiable or more quiet. On the contrary, the girls were the greatest romps, and the boys the most vicious, mischievous, troublesome blades, in town: and for mad pranks, harum- scarum adventures, they always took the lead; and nothing of a novel or frolicsome character was ever attempted unless approved by at least. one of the young Gomerys. They held their position and influence without asserting it; having in- herited that fortunate glft, - the natural tact of leading while seeming to follow.- These were general characteristids; and yet each differed much from the ;others, having peculiar traits and idiosyncrasies, and distinctive elements of originality. With such a- family, it may well be supposed that Mrs. Gomery found abundant exercise for her busy and ambitious mind. The four oldest had- all made their appearance on the stage during the first ten years of her married life; and an interval of nearly ten years 'succeedled before the fifth came I to claim his place and assert his rights. / When he did appear, he was most heartily welcome, more especially to the old squire. In the infaniltile years of the older ones, he had been immersed in business, and had not given so much time or personal care to them as he had wished; but now his business had nearly all left him, add his time was at his disposal for his family, his books, or his farm, as he might feel inclined. The mother, too,--though we have seen she fully appieciated the superior qualities of her first children, --thought she would rear this one td be the crowning glory of her house-. Her experience with the oth- ers had given her better ideas, as she believed, in regard to children, and the way to bring them up; and, as she fancied she had made some mistakes with the others, she would for the future avoid all such errors in her better knowledge of maternity.             - Thus it is that people in their imaginary knowledge, but real ignorance, rely more on education than instinct,--as though any amount of experience or education could serve so well as the native promptings of the young mother's   A FAMLY HSTORY.        141 heart! Why, these were implanted by the' same God who gave the young child to meet its early wants; and who shall say he has not done his work well, and seekjth supersede it  by the fallible, elriing rules of reason? The grim bachelor or morose old mald, whose hearts have become dry, cheerless, and unsympathizing, whin they see the fond, foolish mother giving way to her young darling, humoring its every whim and caprice, and seeing signs and wonders in things that to other eyes have no meaning, may exclaim, "Ah, she will spoil the child! It is getting the upper hands of her now, and it will be ruined. Children should be taught to obey.: Their stubborn wills must be taught obedience in youth. I was brought up to obey." Doubtless you were; and a pretty specimen you are. What impious fools!-as if God, who gave,the young child life, did not give its natural protector instinctive knowledge of its first year's existence. See the child that from its infancy is subjected to the arblitrary, ex- acting will of a parent devoid of this quality! See its pre- cocious propriety, its quiet and subdued deportment! Hear its parrot-like answers, and observe its passive obedience! Then weep with me over a crushed flower, that must grow up dwarfed and stunted, if not deformed; 'and rejoice that I this is an exception, and that the rule is for the first instruct- or-that which Natu're has provided-to encourage -anl. humor the child in its whims and caprices, to visit its trivial offences with indulgent'neglect, and see promise and charac- ter in its wtaywardness and rudeness. You, who, like Mr. 'Bunsby, -are " older than you once were," and who look back to the time when some particular pet and joy of the mother was thl e most troublesome. and mischievous of urchins; who was never so -happy as when engaged in some prank; who would put shoes on Grimalkin, or his grandmother's specta- cle on his dog, - now find him a grown man, and that in life's race he has left all the good little boys behind him; and you wonder jat the chance. Change! - there has been no change. His early pranks, that you regarded as annoying and vicious, were but the effervescence of his Spirit and genius. He had not learned then any other way--of,keeping his active mind at work. But, when he grew older, that same adtivity and restlessness that made him his teacher's torment pushed him into enterprises of moment, and rendered-him a man of Wmarked influence, to whom others look as a leading, vigor-                         ..'    "2      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY : Ous, se -reliant character.

Oh, no! ye would have taught him his place in- his childhood; ye would' have curbed his wayward courses, and taught him obedience and respect; and to-day would have the reward of your cruel care in seeing him a broken-spirited imbecile, yielding a passive assent to minds that have never been subjected to the Procrustean rules. This valued gift, this inborn tact of meeting and yield-, ing to the capiiices, and foibles of the young, is but of terni porary duration. It exists in the natural course of things when needed, and then jis gone. The hen picks and scratches for her whole brood of chickens so long as they are too young to look -out for themselves. But the instinct to do it endures but for a few weeks, and she has no more care for them. So with the young mother: that partial fondness, that natural conformity to the wants of the offspring, is only for her own children, and comes to her with them, and comes not back when other children appeal to her care. The grand- mother may fancy she- can instruct the daughter how to rear and manage the grandchild. But, with all her experience, she is to her in this matter like another person; and she thinks it strange and ungrateful, perhaps, that her counsels are not regarded. But the inconsiderate woman forgets, or perhaps never knew, that it was instinct, and not knowledge, that enabled her to bi'ing through successfully her numerous progeny, and that the instinct no longer remains to her, but exists, in all its unerring force, with the daughter. With her, it: is experience and reason; and though we must trust ,to these when the spark of instinct has been quenched in the dark waters, yet they are not unerring. "Onq must be right; the other may be wrong." Ah, happy the child whose tottering steps are led ]'by the hand that knowis only the moving love to guide it that is in the mothers heart!: Verily Shakspeare uttered a great truth through the mouth of his sensual philosopher, when he said, "Instinct is a great matter."

THE  great ball that was to come off on    Thanksgiving evening was now   the principal, subject of conversation in Montgomery Village.   It was understood that it was to be a very grand  affair, and to surpass in splendor any ball ever held in that or any of the, neighboring towns. There was to be -extra music; and several couples were coming from    Tiv- ernet, Bridgevilld, and other neighboring places.  Little Dil- ler was so busy, that he could do nothing. The supper, so he told everybody, was to be   of unsurpassed  excellence, and got up  in such style as would do credit to the Boston City Tavern; and he buzzed about, stopping to tell everybody he met that thi$ and   that couple were coming, and  that some other great attraction would be presented. He even stopped the mail-coach, as ,it was just starting from the post-office, to tell the passengers that, Thanksgivin' was to be a great day in that village, and to say that he was the proprietor of the Eagle Tavern, and had built an addition to his hall, that cost a hun- dred dollars, to be used for the first time for the Thanksgivin' /ball; and that Square Gomery was goin' to attend, and    all the other big-bugs, as he   forcibly expressed it, in that part of the  countiy. Neither Packard, who   kept the Tivernet Tavern, nor Tozer, who kept that aft Bridgeville, could begin to get up   a iball to compare with those at the Eagle; ,He t .     .   "4-     GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY : had the best hall, and his wife knew better how to get up a , supper than anybody else's wife; for she was a Morton, and they all knew the Mortons were famous good livers. The coach moved away, leaving the little host of the Eagle still talking; the passengers, neither of whom ever was in the place before or ever expected to be 'again, being dumfound- edl with astonishment, and not knowing what to make of the fund of useful information he had gratuitously bestowed upon them. , When it was known that the ball was to be so magnificent an affair, not only did many people who had given up balls and dancing years before determine- to go to it, but many young married people, whose practices of late years were such that sweet Kitty Floyd thought they ought to be stopped, discovered that they could attend, even if their babies were young. There was a ball-futor, and they would not miss it: that was flat. They would go, and take nurses or hired girls with them' to look after the young heirs while the mothers were tripping it over the floor to the tune of the "Chorus Jig" or "Fisher's Hornpipe." As yet, even qua- drilles were unknown to those simple rustics; and the waltz- and polka had never come among them with their graceful movements and questionable influences. Every thing was old-fashioned, notwithstanding that, in the language of little Diller, all the " big-bugs ' of the county were to be present. This ball was a most remarkable affair,-- far more so than the most enthusiastic had anticipated, - and was long remembered in the annals of the town as the 1"great ball. The day was fine, and in the first week in December: fortu- nately, the snow had fallen early that year, and at this time -lay evenly distributed six inches deep upon the ground, and had been trodden just enough to render the sleighing perfect. There was fine skating, too, on the ponds; though as yet the running streams were unbridged by the ice. The snow had fallen before even the ponds had been frozen over: and, when the cold snap came on directly afterwards, it covered them with ice both glare and strong'; s' that, for this day of joy and thankfulness, there were good skating and good sleigh- ing. This combination of blessings as well appreciated and improved by the younger folks, a d was very grateful to those who did not share in the pleasure they afford. It took away the boys with their skates and hand-sleds to skate and   /            ; A PAVtLY HSTORY.        145 slide, while it relieved their mothers of their troublesome presence at the time, they were preparing 'the Thanksgiving- dinner, or getting ready for the great affair of the evening. Kitty Floyd, sweet Kittyl! was married at nine o'clock in the morning. The ceremory was performel by Squire Gom- ery, who, at Kitty's special request, was called in for that service, and for which service the bridegroom paid him- a dol- lar and a quarter in silver. There was no wedding-party, and no one present to witness the ceremony except the father and mother of Kit$y, and her two young brothers, who, as soon as it was over, hied away to the pond with their skates, to be away till the dinner should be ready at two o'clock. The lawyer took his departure soon after the ceremony, leavihg IKitty and Joel sitting side by side iin the parlor, both looking confused, and at a loss what to say. Kitty looked very happy, and, so did Joel; though his diffidence on this occasion made his natural awkwardness more conspicuous than usual. But, though bashful and awkward, he was a man of more than average intelligence, honest, industrious, , and of an amiable and humorous disposition. Had not Kitty been very much. in love, she would have been mortified at some of his awkward ways. His appearance would certainly have tried eyes that were not loving; for were he, as he stood up to be'married, to walk upon the stage of one of our modern theatres, he would certainly be pronounced a carica- ture of the Yankee. His clothes were bran-new. His own sisters had spun the warp and woof of which they were made, and the cloth had been colored and dressed at the Montgomery clothing-mill. They had been cut and made by a matured woman of forty-five,;-for as yet Montgomery did not boast a man tailor, - who did the fashionable cutting for the gay bucks -not only of that village, but for those of Tivernet and Bridgeville. This worthy woman always had several buxom country girls in her employ, and learning her trade. But hers was the village tailor's-shop; and over her door the traveller might read, "Polly WellingToN, Fashion- able Taylor." With such a name, how could she fail to con- - quer on her own chosen field of glory? When asked, by her neighbors more ignorant than she, if she were any connec- tion of the great duke, she always replied, "Distant;" and when the schoolmaster for whomi she had made a sad misfit in the very clothes destined to be worn for te first time- at !\ *   Wr ,   f e fir-St t   "6'      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: the great ball, told her in- his wrath .that the great duke was not named Wellington at all, that the Duke of Welling, ton was only his title, and that his real name was Wellesley, she replied that she was a Wesleyan too, and her father and mother before her, and they always went to that church. But this is a digression into which my perverse pen has led me against my will. But how can I control a weapon so much mightier than the sword?- I, " that never set a squad- ron in the field, nor the division of a battled' knew." The boots of our bridegroom were, as he imagined, the strong point of his-dress; for they were spick-span new, and madei of fine calf-skin, neatly polished with neat's-foot oil: and so 'smart did they look, that the happy man could not refrain from looking at them, but would turn his delighted eyes from the blushing bride to the new boots, and from the new boots to the blushing bride, with a divided if not a diminished admiration. The ceremony was performed in brief terms, the lawyer discharging his duty with dignity and solemnity, The bride's mother turned away, and shed tears,--what faithful mother ever failed to do that? -the father looked on immo- bile and stern, save only a slight quivering of the lip, that showed how deeply his affections were stirred. The boys - undignified brats - looked on agape till the ceremony was over, and then began to laugh; at which Kitty looked at them reproachfully, when they left the room, and hied away with their skates to the pond. The magistrate departed for home, having left the dollar and a quarter in the palm of Kitty when he shook hands with her at parting; and soon after the newly married couple set forth for church, from which they ieturned in just one hour and twenty minutes by the clock- that ticked loudly in the keeping-room. At two o'clock all were ready to begin that important work, the eating of the Thanksgiving-dinner. The boys, you may be sure, were prompt to return in time for this, the family feast of the year; and, at sharp two, they all sat down to the table. At the head of the table sat, Mrs. Floyd. At her right, but turned the corner, sat her husband; and at her left, and opposite to him, sat Kitty. By all rules of modern: propriety, Joel should have sat beside the bride; but, instead of that, he was placed by the side, 'and at the right hand, of Farmer Floyd. The elder- of the two boys sat opposite his mother; and the other sat beside Kitty, sweet Kitty!                          , .   A FAMtLY -HSTORY.        147- The dinner was not a fashionable dinner; or, if-it were. fashionable, it was very old-fashioned. There was neither soup nor'fish, and the nearest approach to wine was a large pitcher of hard 'cider. , But the dinner! -how tempting does it appear to me now as -the memory of it comes up- after many years! There were never such dinners in this world, except on the tables of our mothers and grandmothers. First, there was the tur-, key, only eight months from the shell, and yet large enough to make you doubt whether it was -the old gobbler, or one of his descendants. His appearance on the table had a look- of gratitude'; for it seemed to say that the cooking and basting he had received had done him good. Such a-deli- cate, deep brown all over him! You could see, as he lay in the platter, how, before the kitchen-fire, he had been suspend-' ed by a string, and, like an apostle of charity, "went about doing good;" how that the unctuous juices of his body, as they struggled through the pores of the skin before the warming, grateful fire, were crisped and browred, and formed a sort of crust, or crackling; while that which dripped off to the gravy dish below- was repeatedly caught up, and basted over the revolving, absorbing, and satisfied and satisfying bird. Then how gently had the condiments which seasoned the stffing- composed of bread-crumbs, pork-scraps, and  chopped giblets-penetrated through ,the texture and grain of the body! Ah, how few can appreciate this description! I How few, even of those who live in four-story, stone-front houses, or in first-class, marble-faced hotels, have any such rerminiscences as these! Who, in these days of cooking- stoves and ranges, remembers with just appreciation the cooking of the olden time, when a piece of turkey like that I have described, would tickle the palate for hours after it was eaten; when the very delicacy and relish of the savory morsel would make one to pause, and husband the grateful flavor, and keep it long lingering on the palate?      { Besides the turkey, there was a brace of fat chickens that had been roasted in the old tin-kitchen with the same care as had the more pretending turkey on the string before the fire. For vegetables, there was that great rarity of modern times, potatoes boiled to a dot, and, of course, mealy and palatable; turnips mashed finely, and in slices; and boiled onions.: But the coarser vegetables, like cabbages and car- I    '.        '   "8      GOIMERY OF MONTGOMElRY : rots, eaten on ordinary occasions, were not on the table. Kitty at first abstained from the onions; but, seeing Joel mak-. ing free with them, she sparingly indulged, having heard that persons would not notice the disagreeable effluvia of a breath tainted with onions, garlic, or rum, if they first made their own equally offensive to others. Then came the plum-pudding,  not the rich, hard, incli- gestible plum-pudding on which John Bull nourishes his conceit and surliness, but a lighter, more palatable, and whole.- some article, and as well stuffed withy plums as was the his- toric pudding jnade by good King Arthur. The lumps of fat of the royal pudding, however, were wanting in this, though of eggs, cream, sugar, and spice there was surely no lack. Then came mince-pies, apple-pies, and pumpkin-pies; and withal a dish of tea for the good wife and such oth- ers as cared for it. But Joel and Farmer Floyd preferred the cider. This great dinner,the only dinner of the year on which neither pains nor expense weie spared, wasl de- spatched in just an hour; land, to the credit bf Kitty's nerves 'and self-control, it must be admitted, that, notwithstanding i the excitements of the morning, she ate :a substantial and hearty dinner. But, compared with Joel, she had eaten nothing,--nothing.              , Joel was a fortunate man, as we predicted he would .be. The way the dinner was prepared would have beene evidence, even to a less acute observer than he, that his wife must have learned all the arts'and duties of housekeeping, and qualified herself in one important particular to make her home a place of comfort and content. He was sure always to find his din- net well cooked, his house well arranged, his clothes well taken care of and mended, and that general air' of neatness and enjoyment that would be sure to render his own home, of all places in the World, the most inviting and desirable. All theso blessings were secured to Joel by his marriage; and what better marriage-settlement would he desire for" her?, With their united thrift, they were suie of all the material happiness and comfort that this world could give to persons of their range of thought and limited ambition. Idleness i would have made them miserable, and great wealth would have brought idleness and care.  They were fitted for the lot assigned them by Providence; and they were happy as they could possibly be, wanting for nothing that:was not with- in their grasp.

PTER thee Thanksgiving-dinner had been eaten, the table was allowed to stand for about half'an hour, with its ample remnants undisturbed, while the family gathered round the fire, and discoursed of the-various topics the day suggested. The boys sat quiet and silcr t, as the violent exercise on the pondin the keen December wind, followed by the enor- mous dinner they had eaten, had brought on a feeling of stu- por and a desire of rest. 'The old man smoked   his pipe, looking and feeling very happy; and the good mother sus- tained the burden of the talk; while Joel and Kitty sat sider by side, saying little, but evidently not unhappy. At the end of the half-hour, Kitty suggested that it was timeto be preparing for the ball, and retired to her own room to make ready for tha  t important event. The farmer took his clay pipe from his mouth, knocked out the ashes, and then deposit- ed it, in a little leathern loop made for the purpose, over the fireplace. He and Joel then went out to the stable, and led out theoorse of the'latter, which they harnessed to the sleigh. They then returned to the house. In half an hour more, the bride is ready; all th  e family coe out; the happy pair get into the sleigh; the farmer tucks the buffalo-robe closely around thlem: a caut of the whip, and the horse is off at a lively pace. The farmer and wife now return into the house; tained the burden oil the talk; awhile Joel and Kitty sat side   ' - ;         A PAMLY, 9HSTORY.        : 15 and the latter proceeds to clear away- the dinner, and set thee house in order to receive a few neighbors to drink tea in the evening, congratulate her on Kitty's marriage, and talk about the new minister, the prices of butter, cheese, and poultry, and how to make soap. The farmer went directly to attend to his cattle; and the boys, having recovered from their stupor, and partly digested their dinner, went forth i with their sleds to slide down the steep hill at the back side of the barn. In those "brave days of old,"' when the young 'people- danced with a vim and a vigor that would shame their de- generate posterity, if,-a ball was to be very grand, it, was customary to have the hour of opening as early as two o'clock in the afternoon. If it were less pretending, then the hour Was later; being just the reverse of what it is now, when, the later the hour, the more fashionable the affair is supposed to be. But, though the time set for the ball to commence was at that early hour, the guests did not begin to assemble in much force before three; though some of the younger and more ardent, who had never been invited to a ball before this, were prompt to the hour appointed. The dancing began at four o'clock. Alden Tinkam, cap- tain in the militia, was the head manager, and of course took the lead, and lmarched out his partner with a military step, taking the. head of the first contra-dance with proud and  pretty Isabel Lott for his partner,--the handsomest girl in the room, the most vigorous dancer, and the acknowledged belle of all the balls in Montgomery, whenever the Gomery girls were not present. On those occasions, her light paled like stars before the sun, like a State senator before a mem- ber of congress, or a commoner before a peer. This was a proud affair for Isabel; for, though she knew the mother of those she called "the stuck-up Gomerys" would be there at a later hour, and would attract more attention than any three tnmarried ladies present, she did not fear nor envy her as she c id her daughters, who were the very bane of her life. But a:s they were now away at school, and could not attend, she was, therefore, in high spirits; and, being sure of a great tri- umph, was arrogant and capricious accordingly.  How the young people did dance in those days! There is nothing like -it now. There was none of the graceful, lazy gliding over the floor, in sylph-like ease, to the measured, '  . -        ,    152      GOMJERY OP MONTGOMERY: gentle cadence of the music; none of the voluptuous swinging about of ethereal young ladies in the arms of amorous, dissolute young gentlemen; no dreamy whirl in the gliding, noiseless waltz. No: it was dancing, -vigorous and strong. He was not thelbest dancer who moved most easily and grace- fully about: but the lion of the dancing-hall was he who threw the, most shakes and quakes and quivers of the foot into the time of the music t whose instep had the spring of steel, that would scarcely eyer permnit the heel to touch the floor. To cut the pigeon' wing or the double-shuffle was an accomplishment at a time when the mazurka, the polka, and schottische were unknown. How, when the fiddle,- for, in those days, the fiddle was the chief and often the only instrument of music, though on this occasion, as it was on a scale of unprecedented magnificence, there were two fiddles and a clarionet, - how, when the fiddle was first heard to twang, as the fiddler took his stand in the corner, did the dancers array themselves in precise, prim order in two paral- lel lines up and down the hall, the ladies op one side, the gentlemen on-the other, and there wait, trim, grim, and expectant, for the first downward stroke of the bow that was, to set free theea;ger, restless limbs of the impatient dan- cers! It comes at last! Capt. Tinkam, who has been standing on his, left foot, -his right as uneasy as a steed that scents the battle afar off, and& champs his bit, and paws the ground, eager for the fray,--can scarcely wait for the music to begin. A  "stomp " of the foot, simultaneous with a sharp burst of music, is the signal from the first fiddler, who was called Christopher Columbus; and then the right foot of- Capt. Tinkham, incas inin a bran-new pump, and which, for some time, he could not -keep to the floor but it would come up as by a spring to his left knee, now comes down with a force that makes the house shake; and away go this leading cou- ple down the outside, back, down the middle, back, right and left, balance, turn partners, and so on, as the figure might be. First they pass below one couple, then another and another;. and then the next that stood below them start bo, and by the time the first couple reach the foot, what with thile four or five leading couples balancing and turning cor- ers with them, the whole company are in motion, enjoying, themselves as only people do who have the fire of youth in   A FAMTLY HSTORY.        153 It  their veins, and w*ho have not yet come to thie serious careds I  of mature life. ::  After the first two dances, and just as the third was com- mencing, Kitty Floyd that was, 'now Mrs.! Slocum, came  walking into the hall on the arrii of her husband. I doubt if ever princess walked to her coronation looking more proud and happy than she. Joel had exchanged his new,boots for a pair; of calf-skin pumps equally new; and no sooner had they entered the hall than it was insisted by manager Tink- am that they should lead off the next dance. To' this they assented; and as sweet Kitty stood at the head of the hall, and saw what a grand success the ball was, she could not help thanking Mris. Gomery in her heart for so great a tri- umnph. She and Joel, when they had, long before, first talked of being married on this day, had anxiously thought of the ball, and feared lest it should prove a failure by reason of the superabundance of babies. But here before her stood not only all the young mothers, whose mater nal duties, she had feared, would keep them at home, but seated around the hall were many staid matrons who had not honored a balls for years before. Beside these; several of the most exclusive and fash- ionable couples from Bridgeville and Tivernet were present; and, to crown all, there was an e,xtra fiddle and clarionet. The dance proceeded: sand though Joel, it must be confessed, was but an awkward dancer, she saw it not; and, if he went wrong, she corrected his mistake with a glee and merry laugh that showed she had no eye for his faults. It was fully seven o'clock when Lawyer Gomery and 1iXs wife walked into the hall, -she with stately tread, and he with a merry twinkle in his eye. By general consent, all gave way; and they were assigned the best seats in the room. But neither long remained seated; the old squire was soon among the boys, laughing and joking; and his wife went up to Kitty, and gave her a hearty kiss. .  "That is the first kiss I have got to-day," said Kitty. "For shame, Joel!" said Mrs. Gomery.  ,  At this, Joel colored, stammered, tried to laugh, and-couldn't; and, Kitty,-who by great good luck was standing at the mo- menit on the raised platform which had been placed 'at the lower end of the hall as a vantage-ground for the musicians, in confusion and vexation at seeing Joel so awkward at retort, just -put her arms around his neck, and gave him the  ' --  '   -   '  * , "  ' 1   154      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: heartiest Ismack he had ever received. It was like a spark of electricity, and he kissed back with interest. "Bravo " said Mrs. Golrery; and the spectators of the scene shouted, and clapped their hands. Joel thought he was the bravest, most audacious, and gallant fellow in the world. His spirits rose immediately, and he began to talk and laugh as loud as the gayest of them. In: forming the next set, it was insisted that the old squire and his wife should lead the dance. The latter told Kitty she would agree' toi it if Mr. Gomery would. So 'Kitty led Joel off to find the squire. "O Mr. Gomery!" said she, 'you and your wife must, ,dance this time. She has come here just 'cause it is my wed- din'-day, and she will if yo u will. Do, now, Mr. Gomery!" "Ah, Kitty, you darling! I have got no pumps: besides, I am too old. Let Joel dance with my wife if she wants to dance." "What should I' do all the while?" said Kitty despond- ingly. "Oh! you can talk to me," said the lawyer. I- wanted to dance this time," replied Kitty. "Well, then, you can dance with me. What say you to that?  '  "It is a bargain," said Joel; while Kitty could scarce con- ceal her vexation, having, before this, taken pains to: tell several, that, "'of course, she should dance that night with no one but Mr. Slocum." But, seeing herself-entrapped, she made the best of it; and away they went to find. Mrs. Gomery, who by this time was dandling in her arms the youngest baby in the adjoining room, where several of these rare prodigies were disposed in different corners, -some asleep, some awake, some crying, sotme laughing in their mothers' arms, or taking a slight repast at Nature's fount. Each mother was surrounded by her particular friends, who were protesting their admiration of her young progeny. But more gathered around Mrs. Gomery than about any one else; and little Walter, now six' months old, attracted more attention than any of the others. All were familiar with the traditional scene between his mother and Eliza Thurston, some sixteen years before: so all admiired  all, and made no comparisons. The astonishing ways of, / babies, that know nothing at all, must always, in the presence ) \   I           A FAMLY HSTORY.        15A5 of their mothers, be wondered at and admired, else beware t   'of the maternal displeasure. When this dance was over, which the old squire managed to get through greatly to his credit as a master of the Terp- sichorean art, Mrs. Gomery returned to the nursery-room to    look again after the young Gomery, whom she left in the care of her faithful Prudence Dodge while she was tripping it on the toe still light and fantastic, thoigh her older ', , daughter was already past seventeen. i   The number of babies at this ball was so large, that, if I knew it exactly, I should not dare to tell it, for fear that it !   would not be believed, and thus throw discredit on this en- tire history. There were- some so young, that they kept their mothers from church for three months afterwards; but, as the ball was to ibe such an uncommon affair, go they must, would, and did. 'But, grand and gay as it was, it could - never have attained the importance it was destined to ac- quire in the simple annals of that town but for the mischiev- ous trick of that old joker, Joe Pumpagin. This eccentric. character, who had,'according to his own, story, been a wan- derer all his life, - at one time a sailor, at another a soldier in the war of 1812,- had returned for the last time to the village, about three months before. As 'usual, when he re- turned from his distant pilgrimages, he brought no money with him; butt he somehow found a welcome that many others with money could not find, by reason of his irresisti- ble humor, his strange stories, and odd adventures in foreign lands.* But, as he had no claim on any one in particular, he usualrly quartered himself at the tavern, until, as he said, Diller insulted him by asking payment, and then he would go and live with his friend Tench Wales, where he vas al- ways welcome, and never dunhed for payment. And yet he was always welcome in every house for an evening. With his inexhaustible anecdotes and vivid descriptions of foreign places, he was regarded by the younger folks as their special friend; and they did not quite like that kind of hospitality that kept him amusing the family through the evening, and then let him go to get his lodging and breakfast at the house of poor Tench Wales. But this time he had lived all the while at the tavern; for Diller had been so busy, and had had so much talking to do with people whom it did not concern, that he had no time to 4un Old Joe. Besides, Joe .was       .;;-.       .   ,     , ',       - 'e ' '    156      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY:  not altogether idle or superfluous': he acted as a sort of dep-, uty host, receiving the guests, attending to and communicat- ing their wants, and amusing them with:his jokes. In these offices he was so exceedingly polite, so cordial in his manner) and so generally agreeable, that garrulous little Diller was quite eclipsed by him. He would also entertain .the guests during the long winter evenings with marvellous tales of sea and land, in which he was always the principal hero. He had tact enough always to have his stories partly true, or have a base of truth, so that no one could tell where reality ceased and fiction began. And yet he was regarded as so notorious a liar, that, when a person wished' to say to another that his statement was false, he would convey his idea by saying it was one of Old Joe's stories. But an event that occurred at the Eagle one evening, after he had been regaling with his adventures some stranger guests, and also several of the villagers assembled in the bar-room of the hotel, served to confound the doubters, and set him up as a faithful chroni- cler of truth. He had been giving them a long account of his adventures years before on the eastern coast of Africa, and was just describing the way in which he had rescued a white woman fromn some black cannibals on the Island of Madagascar, just as they were getting readyto kill and roast her. "And did they kill and roast you too? or were you one of the cannibals?" said Jesse Spinney, one of the town's people, who was always doubting and ridiculing Joe's yarns. "True as gospel what I say," said Joe. "Did you fly away with her on your back?" "-No: while they were gathering, fagots for the fire to roast herin, I hid her under the bank of a river. We both sunk into the water among the snags of an old tree that had fallen into the stream; and there we lay for four hours, our noses just out of water. We were awfully skeered for fear the crocodiles or sharks should get hold of us; but the branches of the tree were so thick around us, they couldn't get at us: but them human tigers thought they had us, of  course, and so didn't look for us very sharp. When it be- came dark, I crawled out, and dragged the old woman after me. She was as weak- as weak in the body as Brother apinney is in the head: I laid her on the ground, and then collected some snags and sticks hand made a gort of raft, on which we foated down the river to where our ship lays "   w ' .    t , .' .    I            A, FAMLY HSTORY.        157  "What was that woman's name?" inquired a traveller, who had been listening for' an hour and a half to Joe's stories, without saying a word. "Her name was Piper. She was almost as great a trav- eller as I was. She was the darnest homeliest. woman ever I saw, except that old thing that jilted Spinney when he went a-courting her, because he was so infernal ug- ly." This occasioned a loud laugh at $pinney'srexpense, who exclaimed angrily, "It is strange people will listen ,to such a batch of lies! : ,4 "What is your name? said the traveller. "Joe Pumpagin." "Then, the story is true." "Of course it is: all my stories are." "I don't know about all; but this is I know, for I have a paper in my pocket now that has the same story in it. It is an extract from a book called the ' Wanderings of Madame Piper.'" "Read, read it.!" cried all, as the stranger got up, and took the paper from his overcoat pocket. The traveller complied; and, as the narrative went on, every few moments Joe would exclaim, "Jes' so, jes' so!" and when he came to where the female adventurer told of her 'rescue by a sailor named Joe Pumpagin, whom she described as a queer-looking fellow with his nose turned back like the lid of a coffee-pot, a great wag, but an incorrigible liar, Joe exclaimed, "It's a lie, it's all a lie, - a slander! there wan't no such woman!" But it was too late. He was too clearly identified as the rescuer of Madame Piper to escape her compliments to his veracity; and thenceforth his character as a traveller and a faithful chronicler of events was indubitably established. He could say any thing after that, and few ventured to doubt him. The next night he had a new series of marvel- lous tales, in one of which he sought to regain his former- character as the greatest liar ever known in the country, and which he was in danger of losing, since one of his strangest stories had been confirmed by a creditable witness. On this night he minutely described a voyage to the south pole; and the strange, weird particulars of his voyage weie quite as entrancing as the tale which the Ancient Mariner told to the wedding-guest. His story had the appearance of reality until he came to the pole; and then he went on to describe  "      .  ,    158       GOOERY OF MONTGOMERY; the complicated gea-r of -the axletree on which the earth turned.. The number of sperm-whales used to grease this huge machinery was enormous; and he said it was no won- der they were growing scarce. - The oil was not tried out, but the whales were drawn backwards into a kind of hop- per; and, when their tails were drawn in between the pole and the gudgeon in which it revolved, the poor animals would give a terrific roar, almost as loud as were Brother Spinney's shouts and groans at the last revival. He did not like to stay there long; for the earth whirled round so, that it made him dizzy, and he was near' falling off several times. ' I wonder where I should have gone to, suppose I had fallen off," said he. "Guess you would have gone to hell," said his inveterate enemy, the doubting Spinney.  "Certainly you would if there is any truth in the Bible, which says that all liars shall have their part there." "'Tis a true story," said Joe, - " true as that about Madame Piper and the cannibals. If you think it ain't true, just prove it." As proof of the matter was not easy to be got at, Joe came off again with flying colors, and Spinney retired crest- fallen. On the evening of the ball, Joe was in the highest spirits. He helped the ladies from their-sleighs as politely and gently as the most gallant youth. in town, and took the babies from the arms of their mothers as carefully and with as much. knack as any nurse of thirty years' experience; and he car- ried them into the house more tenderly, I opine, than he had, years before, borne away Madame Piper from the feast of the cannibals. He'constituted himself general guardian and watcher over the little ones; passing from one to another, and praising them all as children of wondrous beauty; tell- ing each mother slyly, that her baby was the handsomest one in the room, and making himself vastly agreeable and useful. The dancing went on briskly till nine o'clock, when supper was announced; and the company proceeded to the dining- room, the old squire and his wife leading the way. It waS. half-past ten before .they left the table, during which time the servants and nurses having charge of the children were very impatient and restless. Old Joe, however, made himself as   I           A FAMLY HSTORY.      .     159 agreeable as possible, and hushed-the children, and told the I?   waiting-women that their turn at the frosted cakes, almonds, oranges, and raisins, would come by and by; and when it i:   did come, and they got down to the table, they must take their time. They little knew the mischief that, Was brew- 1fi  ing in his mischief-making head. iThe anxious mothers, as soon as they returned from the supper-table, all went to look for their offspring; and, seeing them all asleep in their respective corners, told the waiting- maids to go down and get some supper. They also reminded them to remember and take something for the children at home, as their own pockets were not half large enough. Mrs. Gomery, however, gave no such caution; for, before ris- ing from the table, she had laid out two of the finest oranges, and told the waiter to keep them for her till she went home, as they were for her two boys. No other woman present had the assurance to follow her example; but what they took they'removedl very. quietly,--slipping the fruit, nuts, and cake, unobserved, under the table and into-their pockets. But, if their manner was not as good as hers, they secured double the quantity. The servants all rushed to the supper-room; and the moth- ers, seeing the children all quiet, returnedlto the hall, and the dancing soon began again. And now was the time for Joe Pumpagin to carry into effect his Herod-like plot. He --took; a survey of the field. There were seven babies between the ages of three and six months, and any number less than a year older. But only against the younger ones would it be safe for him to proceed. The older might rebel; and their lungs were so strong, they might give an alarm -to their mothers in the hall. But all were alike asleep. Not a waking eye was in the room save his own, and they were wide awake. During the evening, whenever either of the seven younger children had cried, he had either taken it fronim its corner, or from, its mother's or nurse's arms; hand, before giving it back, he contrived so as to take out nearly all the pins from its clothes, and leave it in a ready condition for carryingr into effect his original scheme. Quickly, then, as soon as the coast was clear, he proceeded to his work. First, he took the boy baby of Reuben Chan. dler and his wife Eineline, who was the daughter of his old, inveterate enemy; Jesse Spinney the doubter, and who' lived '                      . ,    160      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: near Bridgeville, ten miles to- the north-west of Montgomery; and for it he substituted the girl baby of another couple, Josiah Gibson and his wife of Tivernet, seven miles to the east. Carefully and gently, his ears all open for the approach of intruders, he unswaddled them both, and exchanged clothes and shifted their positions, so that, in less than four minutes' time, the boy was sleeping in the clothes and corner where- the girl had been, and the girl was equally quiet in the swad- dling covering of the boy. "Neatly done," said Joe to him- self, hardly able to keep from laughing aloud. The next baby he approached was Walter Gomery; but no sooner did he attempt to move him than the young fellow raised a loud protest, that was like to have put a stop to all further proceed-, ings. Joe drew back, fearing lest the noise should be heard in the hall. But the boy was still again, and Joe passed on to the next, saying,to himself, ", You can't mix them Gomerys with common Vpeople, anyway." The next two were a boy and girl, eacl about six months old; but the hair of one was much thiker: and darker than the other. "No time to stick at trifles," said Joe; band within five minutes these two - one of them, the boy, being the son of Lewis Hinson and wife of Tivernet, and the other the only rid first-born child of Nathan Tarlton, a young joiner in the village, who, a year and a' half before, had married Mary- Ann, Fisher, daughter of David the son of Asa Fisher, whom our readers will recol- lect as one of the pioneers of this section of the country-- were transposed.. There was but one pair more that Joe had marked as vic- tims' to be transposed; and he went to the door to see if there was any danger ahead. Two of the young mothers-one of a changed, and the other of an unchanged baby --were approaching; and Joe invited them to observe how sweetly all were sleeping. They immediately returned to the -hall, and reported that all were quiet and asleep; and Joe, having the coast now clear, soon changed these two, who were boys, --one of which was, unfortunately, two months older than the other. The younger was the son of Thomas Homer, who lived about a mile from the village, on the Tivernet Road. The elder was the son of Isaac Crookei' of the village,- a -shoemaker, and a very good one too. He had made the wed- ding-boots of Joel Slocum. This nice and difficult job of transposing and transmogri-   A FAITiLY' HSTORY.  -  fying so many babies was finally accomplished -much nlore successfully than the wicked sinner who had conceived and executed it had ever hoped. He had thought it very likely that he might confound one or two pairs of them, and then that the trick would, be discovered, and a great commotion caused in the ball-room, and great laughter and sport for those who were not personally concerned in the transposition. I   But he had done so much better than this, that he fairly chuckled to himself: and,: for fear he might yet be discovered, EI  he blew out all'the candles, and wet the wicks, so that they It  would not light again; and the only-light in the room came in I   through the door, from a single candle in the entry-way be- I   -tween the room and the hall. Thus the room was so dark, that it would have been almost impossible for the mothers to distinguish the features even of their own children. When 'all was completed to his satisfaction, Joe went down stairs, and out into the open air, and looked about, wishing the party would break up. For sometime, he dared not ven- ture into the hall, or into the presence of others; for he could not keep from laughing at the success of his own trick. Nev- ertheless, he soon returned into the house, and, unobserved, set the old house-clock, that stood in the main entry of the hotel, an hour and a half ahead. Then he went outside, and looked up again at the moon, that was shining full and clear in her meridian. The snow was perfectly white, and glitter- ing in all directions; and the evening was just what all peo. ple wish for a Thanksgiving evening. A happy thought now stfrikes Joe. 'He is in a fever of anxiety that the people, or 'at least the parents of the interchanged babies, should leave before his trick is discovered. But genius is full of resources, and Joe was a genius,- a rare genius; and the thought that occurs to him is, that he will tell the company that the weather has changed, and a snow-squall is approaching. To think, with a man of genius, is to perform. So he immedi- ately re-entered the house, and, going up into 'the hall, ap- proached, as it were, carelessly, near where Mrs. Gomery was standing, surrounded by several who delighted to linger be- neath her shadow; and observed to some one in her hearing, that the weather had changed, and that it threatened a tre- mendous squall of wind and snow. Being an old tar, he was acknowledged as weather-wise; and Mrs. Gomery, noticing the remark, asks6 what time it is. A young man standing , 14*   162      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: near, having a new watch' which he is eager to show, at once produces it,and says it is twelve o'clock. "Later than that," says Joe: " past one." "I guess my watch is right!" indignantly answered the youth, showing his silver time-keeper with pride. "It is bran- new, and cost twenty dollars;, and I guess I ought to know as well as you." "Run down into the entry," said the madam to her servant Prudence, who had just come in to tell-her that Walter was awake, and calling for his supper, - " run down, and see what time it is by the clock." The woman hurried away, and soon returned, saying that it was half-past one. "What! Then it is time for us to go. Mr. Gomery, At is half-past one o'clock; and I meant to be at home by twelve." She hastened to the ante-room, where cloaks, shawls, and bonnets had been left, and was followed by all the young mothers, iwho had been more ala'med at the story of the im- pending squall than the lateness of the hour. Horses were at once called for, and, ere many minutes, began to be driven up to the door; the large old family horse of Lawyer Gom- ery being the first. He handed his wife into the sleigh; and old Joe brought up the rear withlyoung Walter in his arms, who, by this time, was bawling lustily. The sleigh was a -very large one, made to order for the squire, with room for several children in front. This space was occupied on this occasion by the faithful Prudence, who sat on a stool or cricket at th-efeet of her mistress. Joe was equally polite and serviceable to all the ladies who had brought their infants with them,-- carrying them down and handing then to the maternal arms as carefully as though a jar would be fatal to them, and saying to each, as he deliv- ered the precious treasure, that hers was the prettiest baby at that ball. At length the last baby of those he had manip- ulated was delivered to the-last other baby's mother; and the sleigh containing them started off. It was not out of sight; but Joe could hold in no longer. He roared out in a. laugh that frightened the horse next in the line. He shook, he giggled, he snickered, till people thought he must be either drunk or crazy. He returned to the bar-room, and laughed louder than ever. He sat down a moment, and gave a chuckle; then he got up, and went into the hall, where he   A PAMLY HSTORY.        163 caught hold of) some of the young girls, and whisked them [   about like a rollicking young blade; then he improvised a bhoinpipe, to the astonishment of all beholders; then he re- turned to the room where the young innocents had been, if not slaughtered, delivered into unknown hands. Here he-lay down on the floor, and rolled over and laughedand cackled and chuckled like a madman. "What is it,: Joe?" asked Capt. Tinkam. "Give us all a chance."  'You will know before to-morrow night, and then you may laugh too; but I can't tell you now." But, great as was the delight of Joe at the success of his  trick, he thought that it would be prudent to be out of the way of the explosion that was sure to follow. So6he quickly put on his hat and overcoat, and left the house. Some of the people who departed an hour later - for the ball did not break up with the departure of those who brought their ju- venile encumbrances overtook him about three miles from town, on the road towards the sea-coast. But they only said, "He was always an odd critter." - Soon after the departure of old Joe, the interest in the ball  began to flag. Within an hour, all the married people had left, including Joel Slocum and his wife, who had been among the first to leave. Some of the younger people were anxious - to keep it up much later, being desirous of getting the worth of their money: but, at three o'clock, there were few left who were not too tired to dance more; and, half an hour later, all had left, and the lights were put out in the hall. Little Diller, utterly tired out, at last retired to bed; and the ball had closed, a complete success for him and for the glory of his house. ist    164       GOMEERY OF' MONTGOMERY': CHAPTER XIV. "Ah I then and there was hurrying to and fro, 'And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress; And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness." THE quotation is exceedingly apposite as a heading to this chapter, albeit the application is to a different stage of fes- tivities from that given by the author. The ball, in Belgi- um's capital was at its gayest season when "the cannon's opening roar " was first heard; whereas the ball at Diller's Tavern, Montgomery Village, was over before the great com- motion began. But in both cases there was "hurrying to and fro, and gathering tears, and tremblings of distress;" and, if the cheeks present at Diller's tavern did' not blush at their owe praise, it was only because they received it as their hon- est'due, and had no occasion to blush at the fibbing of their adorers. In this instance, however, the blushing, if there were any, was rather at the praise of their babies than of themselves; for old:Joe had told every mother, as he handed somebody's else baby to -her, that- it was by far the finest and prettiest child at the ball, and just like its mother. And there was this other difference, among many more, between the beauties of Montgomery and those of Belgium's capital: those were in a state of consternation and fear because of the dread Napoleon, who was advancing; these were in a state of anxiety and vexation because of Joe Pumpagin, who was retreating as fast as his two legs and a stout- stick could carry him. But we must follow the people to their homes if we would know how they discovered the shameful' trick that had been played upon them, and the way they bore themselves under the great tribulation. 'And first we will accompany Thpmas Homer and his wife,   A FAMTTY HrISTORY.       165 who lived, as we have before said, about two, miles, from 'the village. Their child, which was their first-born, and was only three months old at the times had been sleeping without dis- trbance, except the gentle han dling which Joe had given it, for an hour-before it was taken up to be carried home., The child of Isaac Crooker had been sleeping quietly ever since Joe had metamorphosed and placed it in the corner belonging to the young Homer. This child was some two or three 8 monthss older than the other; and it was this one that Joe took up so carefully, and carried down to the door, in the very sight and presence of unsuspecting Dorcas Homer. "Isn't he a bouncer?" said he, gently tossing him in his arms. "- What is his name?" -"We haven't named him yet," re- I   plied his mother. "Well, then, let me name him," said Joe, holding the child in one arm, while with the other he helped her into the sleigh. 4 Tis the only child in the lot I care to,  name. I tell you what," said he, sinking his voice to a whis- per: " it is the finest baby I ever saw; and, you know, I have been a great traveller. Name him for me, and I will give him a cow." -"It is a bargain," said she, as Thomas took his seat and drove off. I -    They had hardly started from the house, when young Joe I   Puomnpagin, just named, began to make a loud outcry, which the proud and happy mother found means very soon to sup- press. "Say what they will," said she, " about, old Joe :- he knows more about, babies than any man I know of. Isn't he kind to give baby, a -cow for calling him Joseph'?"-- ', Humph!" exclaimed her husband, not quite sure of the re- ward, never having known of his paying a dollar to anybody. But the artful Joe had so smothered-his promises with words of flattery, that the fond mother had not thought of that, and was chatting away to her darling, calling him Joe, pretty Joe, Josey have a cow, - mooly cow. "Thomas," said she suddenly, "this boy's teething!"-"Nonsense!" said her husband: " he is not three months old yet." - He has cer- , tainly got a tooth," said she more positively. "Mr. Pumpa- gin said he was a very remarkable child. I told you he knew all- about babies." The conversation here fell off into com- monplace topics - about the ball, about the bride, and about Mrs. Gomery - until they reached home.  This couple lived alone, having neither man nor maid ser- i V-,nt;, and, as thieves were little feared in those days, they   166      . OERY OF MONTGOMERY: had gone off and left the doors unlocked. They drove up to the door; and Thomas, having assisted his wife and little Joe into the house, drove to the barn,' put up the horse, and fed the- cattle, as he thought very likely it would other- wise be late before they got their regular morning feed. In fact, it did not lack more than an hour of'the usual time for it already. While he was attending to these duties, his wife had gone into the house: and, laying young Josey on the- bed, she struck a light, and began to 'build a fire; for her feet had become benumbed and cold, and she did not care to go- to bed till she had warmed'them. The fire was soon blazing; and, when her husband came in, the two sat before the large fireplace, and warned their toes in the coseyest manner possi- ble, resuming, in the mean while, the talk about the ball. Then she went and brought out little Joe; and, as she did so, she e claimed, "This boy is awful heavy, or else I am aw- ful tired.' She sat down, with the full light of the candle and of the fire shining in his face. "How strange he looks!" said she,-turning to her husband. "Good God!" cried he. "Strange! I guess he does: that ain't our baby!"  "So it isn't," said she, giving a scream, and nearly letting the child fall. Then she began to cry and though the child, unused to such parental demonstrations, began to assert his right to be heard, she threw it contemptuously into the, cra- dle, and commenced wringing her hands, and crying out," Oh, my boy, my poor boy, my darling baby boy! He is lost i! I know he is lost! Some pirates came and stole him away! Oh, dear!                  . "No, they haven't, either," said Thomas. "It is nothing lbut a trick of that old vagabond, Joe Pumpagin. He has given you the wrong baby, and given ours to somebody else. Perhaps this is little Walter Gomery." "No, 'tisn't, either! it is Ruth Crooker's. It is just such a hateful little thing as hers. I shall pisen it if it stays in the house here; I know I shall! Oh, that vile old Joe!" "The wretch!" said Thomas, clinching his fist, and walk- ing up and down the room. "I will go right down to the tavern, and break every bone in his body; I'll kill him; I'll maul him;'I'll beat him; I'll chaw him up. But there is no time to lose. Get the brat ready, and I will bring out the horse again."    I  A FAMIY HSTORY.        167 So, without stopping to put on his overcoat, he rushed out; and, more quickly than ever before, the old horse was har- nessed to the sleigh, and diriven up to the door. His wife, in the mean while, had thrown on her shawl, cloak, and bonnet, I muttering all sorts of invectives against that hateful Old Joe, and the innocent child lying in the cradle. There was not a' word now for darling little Josey. The cow-prospect was suddenly eclipsed. ,  But she caught up the child, so innocently offensive to her eyes, when she heard the bells at the door, and ran out, and, jumped into the sleigh. With neither overcoat nor mittens, Homer stood up in the sleigh, and hit the old horse a smart cut across his hind-quarters; at which he sprang for- ward so briskly, that, in turning into the road, he came very near upsetting the sleigh, and emptying its contents into the road. But no sooner was he in the open way, with a smooth road before him, than his excited driver plied the whip again and again; and the old horse laid back his ears and nose like a thorough-bred. :Better time was never made in that part of 'the country than was made by this old-farm-horse between his owner's house and the tavern. The few stragglers who had been to take their ladies to their homes, and were return- ing to their own domiciles, when they saw Thomas Homer, in the clear moonlight, drive past them so furiously, standing up in his sleigh, and every minute giving the old horse another blow, while his 'wife sat crouching, with the child in her arms, upon the seat, were a thousand times more astonished than; were the witnesses of the famous race of John Gilpin. By the time he reached the door of the Eagle, all was silent about the house and stable. Not a soul was stirring. The lights were all out. Little Diller and his wife, weary and exhausted, though very happy at the success of the ball, having seen every thing safely disposed, and the doors shut and bolted, had retired, and were both in their first sleep, when they were awakened, by a tremendous knocking at the I  door, and a voice crying, "'Mr. Diller, get up! here is a mis- take! We've got the wrong baby!"The little man hopped out of bed, and looked out where the'moon was still shining as clear as ever. 'He raised the window, and called out, "Who's there?" "It's me," answered a voice,-- i me, Tom Homer. There is a great accident has happened! We've got the wrong B iit   168      GOMERnY QF MONTGOMERY': baby! Do you know who's got, our baby? That old rascal, Joe Pum-pagiri, changed 'em. Where is he? I'll kill him! I'll break every bone in his body! I certainly will." "Hold on a .bit, and I'll cone down," said Diller, closing the window. His wife, having heard the conversation, at once perceived, .that, tired as she was, she must get up; and, with great good nature, this worthy couple hastily dressed themselves. Descending into the entry-hall, the landlord opened the front-door, and asked the untimely Visitors to coma into the house. Thomas helped his wife over the slip- pery way from the sleigh 'to the door, taking, the child in his own arms. They then entered the house, and were shown to the guests' parlor. "What does alflthis mean'?" said Diller. "Mean-!" said Homer. "It means that we have got the ^vrong baby." "Whose baby have you got?"  "I don't know whose it is, " said the woman, crying spite- fully ,through her tears. "It is such an ugly little brat, I think it is Ruth Crooker's. Just look at the little goose! Not a bit like mine! Mr, Pump"-   She was going to say that Mr. Pumpagin had called hers the finest baby at the ball; but reflecting that, under all the circumstances, Mr. Pumpagin's testimony in the case would not be of great value, she checked herself. - Now, Ruth, the wife of Isaac Crooker, had long been the mortal enemy of Dorcas Harrison. They grew up hating each other as jealous rivals. A Dorcas, when she first saw that Isaac was showing partiality to Ruth, employed all her arts and devices to win him to herself, but she failed completely; and, when Tom- Homer began to show her particular atten- tion, her kindly acts were fully reciprocated by Ruth, who more than hinted to him that she cared little for Crooker, and that, if he would only say the word, she would send him packing. The truth was, each would have been a little bet- ter pleased originally had the other:s husband fallen to her lot. But it was riot so to be: hence they came in good time r  to hate not only-,each other, but each other's husband, and all that belonged to him. Hence the idea in the mind of Dor- cas, thatlshe had had the child of her hated rival and enemy in her arms for-so long a timei and had actually given it the /  nourishment that Nature designed for her, own precious dar-  . ,   H . * ,A FAMLY HSTORY.             169 "ng, made her mad enough to strangle the child then and there, -the, darling Josey. But when she thought that her own sweet baby was probably at that moment in the- arms I. of the murdering Ruth, pelrhaps imbibing the fatal poison of    the rival blood, which, if not potent to destroy life, wVas yet sure to contaminate the system and make a reprobate of him, at least a thief, she could contain herself no longer, but  screamed and cried, and tore her hair, so as to alarm little  Diller; and even hel husband wTas afiidcl of consequences. Good Mris. Diller, who had come into the room in time to w itness the latter part of this scene, witil her ready tact at once invented a harmless story to calm the storm now raging, furiously. Looking at thie child which her hlsband had been obliged to take, as both Homer and his wife seemed to loathe it, she said, "No, it ain't Ruth Crooker's baby, neither. It "Is it a Gomery?" said she eagerly. "I thought it was too pretty for a Crooker." "Hush, 11sh!" said her husband, whlo saw how ridiculous she was making herself. "Shall wre call him little Josey?"' y   "Well, it is no great m atter if it is Squire Gomery's child. Come, 'homrnas, let us go up to the Pivot, and get ours back, i  aand let Mrs. Gomery haye hers before she finds out the liis- I  take. They look so much alike, perhaps she won't notice the exchange." Diller and his wife, and even Tom Homer, smiled when " they saw the mother's vanity showing itself under such try- [  ing circumstances in such contradictions. If it were Mrs. Gomery's child, then it was a beauty, and wonderfully like her own; but, if Ruth Cloboker's, then it was a hateful, ugly thing, and offensive to the sight. ,  Mrs. Diller: knew well enough that the child was Ruth Crooker's; but her quick wit readily suggested a' way to- lessen the difficulty of the situation. She said- as it was barely possible that it might be the child of Lewis Hinson of Tivernet, though she knew it was not Ruth Croolker's- it would be best to leave it there, and go up to the Pivot, and ascertain if thiere was any mistake up there and, if so, get her own precious. "What's his' name,?"'  "Joe" said'Homer dryly. \   170      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY        i "Satan!" sntapped out his wife, vexed with him, but more vexed with herself.               ' They assented to the proposition, however, and, leaving the child with Mrs. Diller, had no sodner driven off in the ;direction of the Pivot than the cunning woman threw a cloak over hershouIlders, and, taking the disowned child in her arms, ran over to Isaac Crockel's, wlhich, fortunately, was 'close by. The daylight was now disputing the reign of the moon; and, as she approached the house, she saw a light moving about as if something unusual had occurred. She knocked at .the door; which was quickly opened by Isaac, looking excited ain1l troubled. Here is yolil baby!" said she, givinll' it 'to him. He caught it eagerly, a1nd ran into his wife's- bedroom, where she was endeavoring to di-ess herself; but, having learned the mistake about two minutes before, was in such a state of excitement thatshe had got her gown on hind side before, forgetful, at the moment, of a recent incident that rendered that style of dress inconvenient. Isaac had an old-rmaid sister, who lived with him,--a staid, thrifty woman, who had, not been to the ball, and whit, hav- ing got up early and built the, fire, brought the baby out to still its crying. She saw at once it was not her brother's cl, child, and, running to the door of his bedroom, gave the !'it startling information. Quicker than his wont, he was out of bed and in his pantaloons and the pumps he had worn to the ball the night before. In this toilet hle met the landlord's wife as she opened the door. The other child was in the arms of the maiden sister, who was regarding it very much as it might? be supposed a hen would regard a young owl hatched among her chickens. Isaac rushed into the bedroom, carrying the child; and, when thb mother saw it, she clasped it convulsively, and smothered it ith kisses. After fondling it a while, she laid it on the bed, al d changed her dress to the right side before. Kind-hearted Mrs. Diller took the other child fi'om the astonished spinster; and to the question, Whose child is it?"she only-answered, "' It isn't yours," and hurrie1 out of the house, and homewards, wiithout heeding the reply of the indignant maid,v who was almos as nmuch scandalized as if the. answer had been the reverse bof what it was. She returned to the house, and, going into her own room, laid the child in her own bed, and proceeded to complete her     toilet, that had been slighted when' she first arose. It was not long before-she heard bells at the door; and directly she recognized the ejaculationstof Tom Homer and h]is wife, -the latter now mre fur'ious thAn ever. She had not been Very graciously received at the lawyer's; for Mrs. Gomery, when K awakened by the servant, and told the object of this carly V isit, was very indignant, and sent back word that the Gomerys -.and Mackenzies were never mistaken for other people. The servant softened the message returned, so -that poor Dorcas il  still had her doubts, and insisteR orr. seeing the child that M1rs. Gomery had broughlt home. This request being coin- municated to Mrs. Gomiery, the flames of offended- pride that had been smothered for many years - ever since the scene   with Eliza Thurston - broke out with terrible fury. Hastily dressing herself, she went into the fainly kitclen, where a good fire was burning, and-the servant was staring in stupid ^ onderment, first at Homer, who stood hat ill hand, and then  at the pretty, spiteful little virago at his side. Aunt Hannah, j or Goody Wales, stood looking on in wonder. This old lady, with her husband Tench, had gone up to the Pivot on the evening befoie; and as Mrs. Gomery was going to the ball, and must take her faithful Prudence with her, Aunt Hannah was prevailed on to stop tilllmorning, and serve in the dou- ble capacity of housekeeper and watchman. No sooner did-the wretched, anxious mother cast her eyes on' Mrs. Gomery than, she began, "Oh! we have lost our baby. We carried away the wrong one from the ball: that wicked old Joe Pumpagin changed them, and somebody else took our sweet darling, that had never got a name; and I thought it must surely be up here, for it looked so much like your little Walter." "What!" said the proud woman, drawing herself up in indignation, her eyes flashing fire. "Your child look like mine! - look like a Gomery! Prudence, bring out Walter!" The waiting-woman left, and directly returned with the child ,in heri arms.. i"Look at that, you impudent thing! 'Do iyou pretend to compare yoursniffling young one to that? See the forehead, the eyes, the mouth! There is more I character in those bi&g close-set, firm lips than in all the Hoiners ever born since-the old blind one peddled songs for a living!" Whew! here was an exhibition of pride and self-importance, - a conceited I ' ) ' a         ,     '  '^ ' . ; '    1712     GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: woman flying in a passion because her boy was compared to a Homer; for an old Homer,; she had heard, had begged his bread through seven cities! Probably she had not 'read the "Odyssey" in the original. Poor Dorcas could not oppose a word, nor stand an instant, agaibst this withering scorn, but, burstingr into 4tears, meekly retired more miserable than ever. M/Vrs. Gomery repented of her harsh words as soon lS uttered; for who could blame this breaking heart? She followed the stricken soul out of doors, and told her she did, not mean rmny thing unkind, and attempted to console her. But the poor crushed spirit never heeded her. She sobbed as if her last hope were gone; and Aunt Hannah Wales remauaked" at the cruel words, as the sleigh drove away, "When yotYF heart is breaking in anxiety for your boy, you will remember this." At these words, Mrs. Gomery started back. The blood fled from her flushed lcheeks, and they turned pale and white as the snow at her feet., She stood unmoved as a statue for a few moments, as if there had been a power in the words to transform her. "Your heart breakin- in anxiety for your boy" continued ringing in her ears after Homer and his wife had passed out of her sight. "Anxiety for my boy," said she half aloud. Then she gave a sort of hollow laugh; and, at the instant, Prudence was at her sidle, who, as she looked in her mistresg's face, was 'startled at the strange, wild look it presented. "You will catch your death a cold," said she, taking her by the arm :, " let us go in.!"The proud woman suffered herself to be led passively into the house. She sat down by the fire, and it seemed to her that the words sp6ken by Aunt Hannah Wales had a dreadful portent. It had never occurred to her before as one of the things possible, that either of her children could ever give oc6asion for heart, breaking anxiety. Was not her husband, of all men, the noblest, most honorable and sagacious? Was not she the daughter of the good, just, and eminent Judge Macken- zie, of whom all people said he was not only the most impar- tial of judges, bunt the best of men .? Had they not implanted in the minds of all their children the most exalted ideas of virtue- and industry? and would they not do the samne by this one, the youngest, now asleep in the eradle? How, then, could those. words ever come true?  ' "What are you thinking about?" said Prudence, observ- ing the still abstracted manner of her mistress.   A FAMLY HSTORY. ,        173 "I was thinking if it were possible that sorrow and grief could be the lot of those who are brought up in the way of truth and virtue." "We read of One that was without sin, and yet wicked men put him to death." "We do, indeed," said Mrs m Gomery; and now, for the first time during the twenty years sle had lived with her, the tfithlftil Prudence saw the tears flowing fieely down her   cheeks. I When Mrs. Diiler entered the room with the right baby, there was a scene, it may well be believed. But it was: a scene I have no taste for describing. I would not do it if my pen had a diamond point, and would cut through the film of word-description,: and present it, as in a mirror, to the bodily sight, It must suffice that the child was found,  -and the father and mother left with it for theil home. This was only one of the -several denouenzents of the dia- bolically clever plot of Old Joe. The others were some .of them so ridiculous, that I approach the narrative with a cau- tious pen. By telling so much of this singular story, I have got into serious danger : I must tell the whole tale, and  what came of it. Let my reader imagine the difficulty of narrating, without offending the fastidious, severe taste of any, how the discoveries were effected which he already foresees, I must soon be made. How is it possible to relate the manner in which one fond mother discovered in the morning that a metamorphosis had taken place in the night, and the boy of yesterday was changed into a girl? My vagrant pen has led me into this quite against mylwill. It has much to answer for. ' . Among the attendants at the ball, we have already seen, were several couples firomt the neighboring towns, of Tiver- net and Bridgeville, which were situate in nearly opposite directions from Montgomery.  From each of these places one couple had comer bringing one of the doomed -infants. In one case the husband, and in the other the wife, was-a native of Montgomery; and, both couples had eaten their i Thanksgiving-dinner in town with theirs parents. Unfortu- nately, these two babies had been exchanged, the one for the other, by the remorseless Joe; and what made the act more atrocious still, was the fact that one was a boy, and the. other   174      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY : a girl. The latter was the offspring of Reuben Chandler, who had married Emeline Spinney, the daughter of the doubter, a year and a half before, and taken her to his home in the village of Bridgeville, where he was doing a thving business,- selling coffee, tea, molasses teacups, pepper, gin- gel; new rum, tobacco, and the usual groceries, gimcracks, and kickshaws that make up the assortment of a small country store. The other was the child of Josiah Gibson, a native of Montgomery, and son of Levi Gibson, who lived in the Village, and carried on the business of tanner and cur- rier. His son Ihad learned his father's trade, and had com- menced the same business in Tivernet.  , Reuben and his wife did- not reach home till near day- light'; and then both of them WTere so sleepy and exhtusted, that, as soon as they coulId warm their feet at 'the large pile of smouldering embers in the fireplace, they retired; and the 'babv was scarcely looked at by the weary mother, who'- placed it in bed by the side of her servant-girl, a poor, sim- ple-minded paulper about fourteen years old, whose scope of mind will appear fromn thel physiological and' scientific discoveries about to be made. It was seven o'clock in the morning, and the' sun was just rising, when this girl, whose name was Adeline, was called to, from the sleeping-room of her master and mistress, to get up and -build the fire. - She, too, had been to a Thanksgiving- party of young folks the night before, and had played ' IIunt the Squirrel," Puss in the- Corner," "Button, Button, who's got the Button?" and other games, till it was past her usual bed-time. So she was oversleeping herself; .and, when she heard the master{ call, she hastily dressed herself; and soon had a roaring fire in the kitchen. She then .brought out the baby, who was squalling lustily; and her mistress called out to her: to change its clothes, and carry it to'her. "Why, baby, how your hair has growed!" said she:" how funny! when muzzer trimmed it so pooty yesterday; and what a funny little nosey! Ah, it is a boy!," exclaimed she' in astonishment: " who'dl a thought a girl would grow into al boy in one night? Well, I never! I guess Master Reuben will be proper glad; for he said he wished it had been a boy." So, in her glee, she ran to the door, adcl called out to tlhe parents that the baby wasn't " a girl no more, but a boy, and so p0ooty!"    i ' A lMLY HSTORY. .174 I pass over the next half-hour at this house. At the end of this time, a conclave of neighbors have assembled, and are consulti g over the extraordinary event. Poor Emelinel was vexed that she hail not shown mnore ma- telrnal sag,;city than to have brought another woman's child I so far, anl kept it so long, without discovering the mistake. Slhe recollected the super-serviceable condulct of Joe Pumn-  ],aoin the ni,rht before; and it was clear'to her, that when    ]sie was flattering her with soft vords, telling her that hers as the finest baby at the ball, and looked just like its moth- er; and begging her to name it Nancy, after a dear sister of Ii  lhis that died in the poor-house; and promising to give it a  esbnt, at its next birthday, of ten and sixpence or two dol-' I R  lars (enough to buy two sheep, that, being'put out, would increase to a nice little flock by the time she was old enough to get married, which would be a nice thing for her husband);- and she had half promised to call the child Nancy,-it, was clear to her he was, at the very time, carrying out his -  horrid treachery. The whole story was told to the assembled neighbors. All sympathized with the afflictedc parents; but, while some accepted their explanation, others regarded it in. a different light.          , : It is a lmericle," said Deacon Stover,;"a omericle, and is marvellous in our eyes.?'  . . "A fiddlestick.!" exclaimed the indignant mother. "Don't you see it ain't our baby at all? Whose is it? Oh! it mulst be Squire Golmery's wife's, for I couldn't mistake nobody . else's baby for mine; and as she left before we did, seein' as how they are so much ahlke, she probably took lit-: I tie" - "I ancy," suggested Deacon Stover. "It ain't Nalncy, nuther. It's Harriet. Goin' to the bat, Rteuben and I agreed to call it Harriet, after his sister who died, when she was four years old, of the canker-rash.'" "13But it's a boy; and my 'pinion is, that it is the same childl, and has been changed, by a mericle."- "It ain't a bit liRke mine."5 "No, if it's a Gomery it ain't, I amn sure," said Stover, who was yet firm in the belief that it was her own child. There was one other person besides .Deacon Stover who maintained it was the same baby, and had been .metamorl- phosed by some strange process not understood exberpi :b   17'60"     GOMER/ GQF MONTGOMERY: the doctors. This was Silas Johnson, a house-carpenter, who( took the deaton aside, and told him he was going over to Montgomery ithat morning, and, if he would go with him, they would cill on: Dr,. Purkltt, and get his: opinion on the case. "Perhaps," said Johnson, " he could change it back, and make it the same as before.'  .. The deacon assented; and, as soon as Johnson cotuld get- his horse and sleigh ready, the two men, in pursuit of knowl- edge under strange circumstances, set forth to consult the learned doctor.  They were followed soon after, by Reuben and his wife with the child. The latter party went directly to Diller's  'Tavern, as the place where they would be most likely to hear of lost helrs. They were naturally anxious to recpver their own lost treasuie; but, perceiving and appreciating e he trick that had been played upon them, they didl not doubt but it would  e well taken care of in the same e manner as they liad ta n care of the unknown one. They drove up to the tavern, a'ound which, thus early, was collected a considera- ble crowd; for by this time the- story of Old Joe's pranks was known. at every house witlin a radius' of two miles from the village. There was imuh curiosity mlanifested by the crowd, when the sleigh drove -up, to kinow if the child of Josiah Gibson of Tivernet had been brought back. Josiah and his wife had aLrrived about twenty minutes before; and when no one present could give any information regarding his missinglboy-baby, and- no one was present to claim the girl he had brought baclk, Reuben and his wife entered the parlor of the Eagle, the latter carrying the child, that was no w quietly asleep. They saw the room full of the women of the village, all looking serious anii sad as if at a funeral. Josiah Gibson sat near the fire, holding their child in his arms, while his wife sat sobbing beside lim. As soon as she saw Emeline, having a- child in her arms, enter, she rushed towards her and, finding it vas indeed her own darling, she clutchedl it from her, and ran away to the corner!of the room, and hugged and kissed it till the baby roaredlout an infantile protest. Emeline also caulght -up her own baby; and, though less demonstrative, the tears in ler eyes told of a mother's joy. 'All the other! changes had been made before, as the parties lived near the village; and being familiar withi each other, and: all the children of the neighborhood, the anxious , r '   : MrrY- HSTORY. '     1" parents, on finding whose child had been substituted- for , their own, exchanged with comparatively little emotion or excitement. 'No one among these thrifty people thought of requiring boot when asked to trade back,- a thing never known before inl any trade in that part of the country. Silas Johnson andDeacon'Stover, instead of going to the tavern, as everybody else did, for a solution of the mystery, went directly to the house of Dr. Purkitt; and I :should be guilty of infidelity to the. trutih of vital history if I did not here give a full and faithful account of the interview that tokl place between these three philosophers. 1 They entered the house of the learned physician, each one , of them with so serious a look, that the doctors wife had no doubt they had. come with the mournful story-that a patient: had died, and his services would be no longer needed. They were at once shown into the presence of the wise man-; when, without stopping for-preliminaries, Silas began in a manner all his own, making that use of the English lan- guage which had given him a celebrity in that part'of the country as the mortal foe of Dr. Johnson and, Noah Web- ster. . "Doctolr,) said he, we come to you on an affair of great . approbation, and puny importance, and auspicious difference. It is not any thing affecting our fiscal- health; and wevdon't want to pay fort. But as friends of science and religion; i. an? men of function and good moi'al obligations, and fathers of families, we want to ask your advice and opinions; and if, at the same time, you could tell me what to do for my oldest boy, that is poorly, and not charge nothing for its, Deacon Stovdr says you will get paid in that kingdom where neither thieves- nor rust doth corrupt, nor moths break hrough and steal, 'specially if you tell him also Ihow to' cure 1is wife's cough." ,          X  "Well, well," said the doctor, who, sitting in his little dingy room which he called his office, was reading at the moment of their entrance, spectacles on nose, the "Adventures of Peter Wilkins," -  O well, well, tell us all about it.' Doctor Purkitt was a man of sixty, portly and bald; and partly from fear of medicine, and more from ignorance of it, had-never given but little to his patients, and hence had been wonderfully successful as a1practitioner. His face ws a liv-, ing contradiction; for no man could be so wise as he looked;.  f-   178      O MERY OF MONTGOMErRY: Pushing back the spectacles on, his ample forehead, he sat squarely before the fire, a hand onr each knee. His teeth lere so set as to give his lips their appearance of greatest wisdom; whllich, even when shut, seemed to say, that, as soon/as opelred, words of waright and wisdom must come forth. The two callers did not doubt that the knotty ques- tion they had to submit to him would be solved without hesitation.      '  During the drive from Bridgeville to Montgomery, John- son and Stover had discussed with characteristic language and logic the remnarkable event that had ocouecld.: Both believed that a boy had been metamorphosed into a girl. The latter thought it ",a mericle ;" but Johnson said "mlericles did not happen in these wicked and1ungenerate times; and if -it is a mericle," added he, " what is the 'Use of going to see Dr. Purldtt about it? Ite don't know nothin' about mericles. He don't never cure nobody by power of grace, but is always givin' pills and rhubarb and calomel. Ie knows an awful sight about them things. I have heard him talk of medicine and mattery medicum, so that I couldn't understand a thing about it; and you know I'm not a niggorant man. I have read a great deal; and if I don't misremember, in some of the books of unheard-of countries that I have examined, such things are said to be quite com- mon, and in the nat'ral course." Both of them being thus, convinced that the child they had seen in Reuben Chand- ]er's house was his own, and had been changed from a 6oy to a gill, it was not thought necessary, in stating the case' to Galen, to make any allusion to the ball, or to the possibil- ity that an exchange lhad there been made. The mother's 1indignant rebuke of such a suggestion was not mentioned.,. uA most remarkable case," said the deacon, - "a mericle, probably; though Mr. Johnson says such things is common in some countries." "Well," says the doctor, "what is it?" "You know Reuben Chandler, that married Emeline Spin- ney"        -  "Yes: I was out there when their child was born." "It is the same child! You remember it was a gii'l?" "Yes, I believe so ; but I a'most .forget, I have so many of these things." "Yes, it was a girl last night; and this morning when they 2..   'A FAMLY HSTOIAY,       I  took it up to dress it, it was a boy. It had been changed in the night. Ain't it a mericle?" Doctor Purkitt was never known to be taken by surprise. Whatever the case might be, he assumed and appeared to know all about it. A case like this, the facts being unques- tioned, would have astonished most men. Not so D1r. Purkitt. If he had not seen, he had always read" of, similar cases to those submitted to, him, and poured a flood of light on them that so dazzled the listeners, that they at once knew it was  because of their own ignorance that they could not understand all about it. His first reply was one that would have done no discredit to Mr. Bunsby; for he said, "It was a case ae- cording to the laws of Nature, or else it Was of a supernatu- ral character," ' "It couldn't happen unless it was a mericle," said Stover. "Oh, yes! such things have been known before, but very rarely. In fact, I have never known of more than two or three 'cases of the kind in all my practice, now going on for more than thirty years." "Then- it is not a mericle?" "Oh, no! such things do happen. I have read a good deal about them in the books. You say the girl was changed to a boy? " "Yes: it was a girl last night, and a boy this morning.", "Yes, yes, of course: these chances are all that way. But boys never change to girls, in the course of nature. Had it been that way, I should Certainly have allowed it was a miracle. But this is a mere odd occurrence, a freak of NaI- ture; or, as we say in Latin, a lusus natura."  "I thought likely that was it," said Johnson. "I told the deapon, comin' down, you would have some Latin or science to make it all clear to us. A Lucy Natury I s'pose it was called so because :Lucy was changed to Nat, some time:; wasn't it, doctor?" "Perhaps so," said thd doctor, not caring to be drawn into a philological explanation. They had got thus' far in the elucidation of the subject, when the door opened, and in came Levi Gibson, father of Josiah, who, having just heard of the trick that had been 5 played on his son and grandson, was in a very bad humor with the world in general, while another incident had .p him in a bad temper with the doctor in particular. -Enter-   3180    G-OMERY OF iONSTOO-MU'  ing the doctors sanctum with a brusk; excited 'manner, he scarcely'noticed the Bridgeville people, but at once broke forth :- ' "Well, well, this is a pretty go! My son Josiah's baby was changed'last night," "Changed!" exclailed the doctor. "Very singular!  We were just talking about such a case up at Bridgeville. , I have known such cases before in my practice. Of course, it was a girl changed to a boy." "No: it was a boy, and now it is a girl." "Very singular!-the only similar case I ever heard of since the time of Tiresias, as related by Sydenham, vol. iii. page 191. The case of Tiresias is well authenticated. He was Changed back and forth: from a man to a womal, and from a woman to a man, several times. You will find it laid down in all the old books, whhihc are much more reliable than those of later times. Galen, I think, mentions other instances of such changes."  "Changes! what do you mean? My son's boy was changed at the ball last night by that rascal, Joe Pumpagin : so he car- ried home the wrong one. You didn't think I was such a. fooli as to suppose there was any other chlane, did you?h"  'TMr.- Gibson, your remark is i reflection on  my profes- sional knowledge and character." ' Gibson was a testy, fiery-tempered man, and in particularly bad humor this morning; besides which, I am sorry to say, he had very little respect for the pompous ways and words of Dr. Purkitt. : I always knew you were a pot-bellied -old fool" and pre- tender, that knew as much of medicine as my dog knows of !law, or my horse of divinity but I did not think you such an ass as to suppose my glrandson could be changed into a girl." If a scow I could have withered Gibson, he would have been oalcined on the spot; but, as it couldn't, he continiued : :'I come to pay you for them pills you sent up to my daugh- ter., Porerful pills! one a day, no more;, for they were very powerfal! She took them for a week, and got worse all the time; and this morning her little boy, three years old, got hold of the box, ate the whole on 'em -at once, and, they hain't hurt him any. How much for them pills? I want to pay you."   ,             , ,   f             ! A FAMLY HSTORY.        181 "Leave my,house!" roared the doctor, who had been so chokecd ith rage, that, until now, he could not speak. Gibson threw down two coppers to' show his arpreciation of the doctor's medicines; and, with the 'deacon and Silas A Johnson, left, and went over to the tavelln. There the conduct of Old Joe was the subject of conversa- tion among all. Thosd who had not been sufferers laughed at the joke; but some of the others were violent and angry. All the soft nonsense hd had tallked to the beguiled and de. . ceivred mothers was repeated. Tom Homer, afiter taking his wife and the right baby home, had returned on purpose to wreak his vengeance, on Old Joe; and the foolish fellow, in his wrath, told how the smooth-tongued villain had promised to give his boy a cow if they Would only call him Joseph, and the rascal never had a cow, nor a dollar to buy one with. "He is a swindler," saic he; " and we mushtgo riht up to Square Gomaey's, and get a warrant, and send the sheriff after him." Lewis. Iinson said, "He had cheated his wife the same way, and promised, if they wouldn't call their bov Roger Sherman, as they had determined to do, but Joseph Pumpa- gin, he would leave him five hundred dollars in his will: And while he stood holding the baby, w-aiting for the sleigh to come up, he told my wife how he had a great estate com- ing to him in a few days. It was in England. Very likely he would be a lord before he died; for, he-said, mighty big fools were lords so'uetimes." By gifts like these, thickly coated with words of flattery of both mothers and children, Joe had got all the mothers of ; the boys to promise to name their sons Joseph, and the moth- ers of the girls to name their daughters Nancy, after his - sister, who had died in the poor-house, and who, had she lived, would have bieen a great lady, and lived in a castle when he got his estate and became a lord. In the midst of this conference, which was held in the large parlor of the ,tavern, and was participated in by Inen and women alike, the old family sleigh of Squire Gomery was seen going by; and Landlord Diller cried out to its occupant,. who was the lawyer himself, to call, as his advice was wanted. So the lawyer reinedl up to the door, and went in; when there was a fresh narration of the whole affair, "whereof, by:par- cels, he had something heard' already. The siUfferers united in saying that Joe should be pursued The s' erer          O  e pursue   182      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY ' by the sheri, and brought back, and tried, and put into the . county jail. ," What shall he be tried for?" asked' the squire with great gravity. "Burgltry," said one. "Arson," said another. "Getting goods under'false pretences," said Reuben Chand. ler. "Abduction," said Capt. Tinkham. "Yes, seduction," said Silas Johnson. "( As you have agreed so well on the offence, who is to pay the costs?" asked the lawyer. "I can't take up the case unless I am paid for it."            , !"Get it out of Joe," said Tom Homer. "Will you give me a lien on the cow?" inquired the law- yer. 'Or perhaps Hinson will give me an interest in the will as a fee? But then Joe's promise was contingent on, the name of the child. Of course, if I take up the case, iyou will call the boy Joe, - Joe Pumtpagin,- else I lose my fee." "I'll see him hanged first, and you too!" said Homer. "The old wretch! He give a cow! He make a will! i wonder what he has got to will!" "His good name," saidl the lawyer; "and probably he thought he might will that Hinson's child should have five hundred dollars whether he had a dollar himself or not. You must admit his intentions were good. And then it was kind and thoughtful in him to remember his sister who died in the poor-house. You certainly will not disregard his brotherly affection," said he to Chandler. "You will, of course, name your girl Nancy. Nancy Pumpagin Chandler, - Nancy P. Chandler, - a very pretty name." "You hateful old thing!" screamed out Erieline. "Do you think I would name my child after a pauper-?" '; "But, then, if her brother is a lord!"  "Comelet us go," saiid she to her husband; and the two left the room in what the squire called high dudgeon, bear- ing awaythe yet nameless child. i The idea of pursuing Joe was abandoned; and the injured parents returned to their homes. Those who had escaped Joe's wicked arts remained for some time either at the tav- ern or Caleb Thornton's store, joking and laughing at the   - PFAMLY HSTORY.        1 83 / trick. -Before night, Joe was more popular than ever; and, had he rqturned that evening, he would have been a hero. 3But his time went by. He failed to take that tide in his affairs that leads on to fortune; and, on the next day, every thing was as orderly and quiet as if nothing unusual had , occurred. The ordinary humdrum had settled on the place.          5              '     S    184       GOMDUBY OF MONTGOM1ERY:, CHAPTER XV. IDeddeiona. I sawpOthello's visage in his mind; And to his honors and lis valiant parts Did I my soiil and fortunes consecrate." - OTHELLO. THE annual Thanksgiving Day had been the firstTburs- day in December; and , twob weeks from the succeeding Sat. urday, the two 'daug ters of Freeborn ,Gomery returned to their home from the Echester or East Chester (,as it had for-          se, ,h - merly been called) Academy. In their ro'espective classes, they had fulfilled all of their prouid mother's expectations, and car- ried, off all the prizes they had seriously contended for, The New Engcyland of that dhay, as the New Encg:lind of to-day, boasted of many beautiful' girls; and as the rule was foir all, to be healthy, rosy, and fiair, the exceptions who excelled the generality were wonde'rfully fair. .And among 'the excep- tions we-e ,still other exceptions, very limited in number, whose exceeding beauty was. celebrated throuighont the coun- tyr. ,The daughte-s of Freeborn an id Jane Gomery were such exceptions. They had 'been, as we have seen, wild, romping girls at the town-school, and would slide down the steepest hills with the boldest of the boys, and hold a good hand at a snow-balling, nor wince at a frozen shot, or cry out that it was unfair if it jstruck spank against the, ear. Learn- ing withl great quickness, and lhaving amother at home such as no other children of the villagye -hlead, they were soon so much in advance of the" rest of the school, that they must be sent abroad to complete their education. Tlhe two sons,besid es the young hero Wqlter, whohbad so successfully proteste  against exchange to Joe PUmPagin, were both younger than the-sisteirs; and Theron was the elder of the two by a year and a half. The younger of these, whose name was Wirtimir (where the name ca e from, I.   A FAMLY HSTORY         185 never could learn after much inquiry), usually called Wirt, fi lr sholrt, as rwas said in the vernaclar of the times, rwas, at the period to wthich we have now arllived, fourteen years of a,e.. The boys were not only younger than the girls inI yealrs, but they developed later in life; so ,that, wrllen the yollunger sister was become a belle of seventeen, the eldler boy, Tlelron, was an awkwardl youth of fifteen and a half,-that coulcld not ^walk up the aisle of the old clhurch withouat blushing as red as a pilpipn at the idea that evelrybody was lookling at him and scanning his applearlance. In oitwarld semblance, too, the boys .took after their father rather than their mo- ther. They, were strong, healthy, hlaldy boys; rouh and ready at play, and at their books more aplt than eager. 'Health is beauty:" but that remark must be qualified and restricted within certain limits; for wrhen children give the most evidence of health at the time they are growing fast, then they are awkward in nalnets and uncouth in appear- ance. On the other hand, the sickly, dainty boy or girl that is always ailing, and always petted, never knows the gawki- ness and diffidence of a healtliy, rnodest, and natural transi- tion from childhood to youth or manhood. What is more ungainly or unseemly than a fast-growing boy of fifteen or sixteen, his coat made a short the before - too small his pantaloons too short, his beard too unpronounced for the unnatural barbarism of the razor, and too fuzzy and colorless to be clipped as beard or nursed as whiskers? If he wears a coat, it is too old for so young and raw a boy; if a short jacket, it is too young for such an overgrown stripling. Like' Challes Lamb's poor relation, "he is known by his knock,- a lap between familiarity and respect. He entereth smiling and embarrassed. He holdeth out his hand to shake, and draweth it back again. He is too humble for a friend, yet taketh on him. more state than befits a client. His memory is unseasonable, his-compliments perverse, his talk a trouble,  his stay pertinacious."  All this is the transition youth. He knoweth not, when he speaks, whether he will be rebuffed as presumptuous, or sneered at as diffident. He must at some time pass the fence that' separates boyhood from manhood; but it is odd, that, every day during that unhappy period, he, will be reminded by some that he has passed it too soon, and by others that he has too long lagged behind. Thus be- tween fires in front, and fires in the rear, he will be kept-    '186      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY; state of perpetual annoyance-and distrusts which must con- tinue 4till the line is so distinctly cleared that he may assume the'boldness of the man, without fear of being snubbed folr his presumption. p " 'With the transition girl it is vely different. She passes, as it were, in a single day, firom girillood to wolnnllhlood. The period of her elnbarrasnsment, and doubt of her position andl place, is short, but yet there is to leie stch a time, whln, leav- ing of the playffilness of the child, she asshtnes the dilgnlity tof the lady. She has not learned wlhat to (do wit liher armns, that seem to have grown out of proportion. Shle can no longer busy them with dolls, or hide her face in her Ilands, and laugh when spoken to. So, in this growing, developing period,- brief fortunately for her;--she is awkward, embar- rassed, and affected. Surely this health is not beauty. Though Flreeborn Gomery was a man in easy circumstances, and, for that part of the counltry, was considered very wealthy, -having no idea that either of his sons would ever be re- quired to earn his bread by manual labor,--yet he put them to work on his farm during their boyhood, to inure and , harden them to toil and endurance. They were required to , labor as hard and perform as much as the sons of poorer peo. ple whose earnings were needed for their parents' support. The daughters, too, were taught all the arts and secrets of ' housekeeping; and, ere they were sent to the academy, could bake and blew, and spin and weave. Their mother was in all respects asutperior woman, and had the sagacity to see that useful knowledge would not come amiss in any station in life. She had never doubted, as we have seen - on two menorlable occasions, that her children would all fill leading positions in life, and jhat, in influence and public' regard, they trould- far. surpass tiose of her two sisters, who had malrried men of great wealth, and who, at the --time She acceplted 1Freeborn Goinely, were astonllished and mortified at her choice. Of the daugh- ters of Judge Mackenzie, she lkne ash a s ell as Lanybody else that she was fir the hlandlsomest, and 11ad had more m:argnifi- ce'nt offers than any of them, among wholn was the Boston heir betole mentionedl,and a widower, -at the time a n;tional senator, witlh flattering prospects of being 'zadvanced' to a ritich higher position'. Other people had thoughllt that her,.sisters had made much ;more eligible matches than she; but she thought far otherwise. The nobility then known in America -was of   -A- FAMLY HSTORY. 1Y .'     87: that kind which she fancied she saw in the shrewd, honest, humorous Freeborn Gonecry,  Her elder sister, Catharine, -had married the only son of a rich merbhant of Philadelphia, named Gilderkin, who had retired on a colossal fortun e, con- sisting mainly of mines of coal and iron, which the son subse- quently inherited, and the care of, which had been the busi- 4  ness of his life, The' younger sister, Margaret, adl, married the son of old Thomas Fogus of NeSw York; a man who, be- ginning from nothing, had seemed to have been the favorite of Mammon; for his investments always exceeded his calcu- lations. After accumulating a small capital, he invested a part of it in real estate in the outskirts of the city, that in a fe!w years was worth ten times the sum paid for it; and, in subsequent purchases, he pursued the same policy of buying land just in advance of its sudden appreciation in value. His only child, Thomas Fogus, junior, inherited much of the old man's business tact; and, being of an aspiring disposition, he changed his plebeian name from Fogus to Fogue. This name itself implied solidity, wealth, and conservatism; and such were the characteristics of young Thomas. He was. turned of thirty when he first rhet -Marigaret Mackenzie;' and, -at the tim& he married her, the yearly income of hisl fa- ther's property, that was soon to be lis, was nearly as much as the whole fortune of Gomery of Montgomery. And Gom: ery the country attorney had married the fairest and wit. tiest of then' all! i - The family residence of the Mackenzies was about two miles firom the thriving, puritanic village of Plympton, and at about equal distances from Boston and New York. It was not on the line of the main roar between the two cities'; and it is my impression that, Boston was a little nearer and' easiedi to reach of the two. At any rate, the fami-ly used to visit there much oftetier than in thq laraer and rival city. tThey had more friends there; and the judge was obliged to go .up there at least twice a year to attend court. So it came to pass that Boston was the city to whllich they went for fishons, books, paplers, and such other things as could not be obtaineet at 'the vill-age near by.     , To this country i'esidence came the suitors of the thllee belles; and. their number was large, and their pretelsions varaiou s. Hither came the village lawyer and the village :hopkepers; and hither, :too, came the demure- parsons with   188'      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: white choker and intellectual spectacles. The judge's house was a great resort for the young people of the village; for the old man, now a widower for the last six yealrs 'delighted, to see' the younger folk enjoy themselves': and his house was truly a happy place to loolk in 'upon of an evening, and a most enjoyable hlouse for all to visit, except those who came With "serious and honorable intentions." Parson, Skinner, who was of this latter class, after. many and dolorous visits, in which he had taken every possible and improper opportu- nity to impress first on one sister; then on another, and after- wards on the third, the vanity of all worldly things, and the great advantage sure to accrue from giving up the follies and' pleasures of this- world, having, after two years' seeking, found it impossible to propose to either, finally abandoned the field. He was encouraged to this raising of tleo siege by the death of one of 5is richest parishioners, who had left a widow with only two children,--both of which, he told his confidential deacon, were hopefullly sickly; and it would be a pleasure to him to minister to their spiritual wants, should the Lord see fit to remove them in childhood from the trials and temptations'of this'.wicked world. I have a great regard and respect for that woman who never allows ,any man to propose to her, except it be the one whom she has resolved in her own hebart to accept. A woman of any tact or discelrnment can always discover signs of an approaching p!roposal, can always foresee that a plan of siege is going on, even though it be not according to the military rules observed by Uncle Toby when he made his famous attack on the citadel of the Widow Wadman's heart. Then, if a man has either senlse or discletion, he is saved from the pain and mortification of a refilsal. It is natural that -women should delighllt in malting conquests. They like to see that they fascinate and please the other sex, apd can have them at their feet at a word: but they can see this without a pro- posal, which, if refused, loaves the leart-stricken proposer humbled an'd mortified; and, without saying so directly, they can give hilm to undelstand, that, by retrent, lie can save limself from the humiliation of rejection and defeat.; But the selfishness and vanity that induce a iwoman to lead a man on to a declaration,. in order to witness liis discomfit-  ure and humiliation, and boast of it afterwards, are among the wickedest and most detestable weaknesses of the   A PFATrIY HSTORY. i       189 sex. They have the conscious triumph of adulation long before this; and if they have those gentle feelings that - befit a woman, thlnt delicate sense of tact and kindness that are indispensable to the true' llady, they graceffully avoid the subject, tlat, if purlsued, can only lead to disalppointflment, and convey such intinlmations as effectually warn off those vho -are prone to :a bootless errand. Few men are 'like Rogers, the banker-poet, who said that lie made it a rule, whlenever his name was colnnected witlh that of any marr'iage- able woman, to say that hle had been refilsed; and, it' Ire did say SQo always, I doulbt not thlere had been one occasion, at least, when the confession caused a deep'sense of sonrrow and pain. I Ilave before said that Jane Macklenzie had had other offers. than that of Freeborn Gomery; and, after ite late digression, it may be asked how it was that she allowed them- to be made. -Had she'dlesired it, she mighlt have lad scores; but she effectually warnied off all such small pretenders as Par- son Skinner and Lawyer Eveieth of Middlebury; but when deputies duly authorized by the Boston Croesus and the senator in Congress Came without notice, with formal plro- positions, they': eceived what their impertinence deserved,- a flat refusal. The style in which the accepted suitors from the great cities appeared at the door of the paternal mansion hllowed plainly the difference of their circumstances from that of the country lawyer who was to carry off the belle of the three. They came in elegant carringes, with servants and outfits, and changes of raiment, equal in number to those of Naaman when he went to consult Elishai;while he came on horseback, or perhaps in the public coach, with a pair of saddle-bags containing Iris extra linen and a change of apparel. It so chanced that on one -occasion the three suitors all arrived on the same' even- ing. A little before sunset migtlt have been seen a fine, open carrliage, drawn by a showy pair of gray nags, with two gen- tlemen on the back seat, and a spruce driver in front, moving with a quickened "pace up to the door of the old-fashioned rmansion of Judge Mackenzie. Tlhey were not unexpected; fobr, being the accepted suitors of the oldest and the yountgest daugters, their arrivall had been previously ,annoul ed. Tlhey hadhardly saluted their friends, and were yet looking to the disposition of their trunks, when '"a solitary horse-   i-90    - 'GOMEY OF MONTGOMERY :: mnan might have been seen" winding his way up the long lane to the house. His appearance was certainly less pre- tending than that of his brothers-in-law in posse; and when \ , the exultant sisters, standing on the steps of the house, look- ing with pride and satisfaction at the splendid turn-out of their lovers, saw the solital:y Freeborn coming up the lane, covered with dust, on his stout old roadster, they turned with a look of mortification and pity to their sister, who stood liike a queen, her eyes beaming with joy and love on the applroaching traveller. She caught the lookk of her, sis- ters, and fully understood it ; and away she rushed, fi'nd, meet- ing Freeborn at some distance fi'om the house, she seized hs hlnd, and by main force pulled him from the horse, and gave him a saluting kiss that rather shocked her sisters, lvho had received their lovers in a manner that would have done credit to the training of a boarding-school miss. With exulting-pride she led her lover up to the door, and introduced him to the -sprigs of city lifb; and having told the servant-boy to bring in the saddle-bags, regardless of the astonished and angry looks of her/ two sisters, she showed him up stairs to the best of the thlee rooms that had been prepai ed for the expected guests. Here she left him to per- form J is ablutions aid deck liimself in his Sunday garb, -while her sisters were getting throungh the formalities of the meet- ing, and expressing their apologies for being so unprepared. Love makes no apologies,-and love-wants nonel but these two sisters were not in love, but were only making for them- selves most splendid mat'ches. Hence, though this day had long been looked forward to as the happy day of the lovers' arrival, and they had been watching for good two hours. for "their appearance, they thoughtit better to pretend want of preparation. In -due time the table was laid for the hungry and welcome guests; and you may be sure the best the house could afford was on the board-.- With an eye to the wants of the hungry travellers, they had boiled, in the morning, two of the fittest chickens in the yard, with a square piece of corn-fed pork, and set them awZay to be eaten cold. They also had some slices of cold corned-beef and cold neat's tongoue, and-hop- bread light and sweet, such as the city be'aux never saw anffywhere else, and Freeborn saw every day at his own home. Then there were -hot biscuit, and sponge-cake and pound-   --A FATILY "HSTORY.       , 191 cake, and strawherrly preserves, and tea and coffee, with retamn,xch and golden; and- all set off with the best china and knives and forks, bought in Boston the winter before. The supper was disposed of; not without a variety of co1n- versation, in which Freeborn somehow took the lead; and it would have been plainly evident to an impartial observ;er h:,ld such been present, that his was the leading mind -of the company. When the city sprigs introduced into the qonver- sation the polities and literature of the day, he showed a readiness in discussing them, and an understanding of their mnerits, that, while it surprised the others, greatly 'gladdened the heart of one. But, wlen they introduced the subject of the amusements and fashions of the day, he wisely -said nothing oil matters so much above hs comprehension. All^ of the sisters saw the difference in ilthe stcoe and calibre of the emen; and the sparkling and happy eyes of one gave back with interest the triumphant look that the others had given her when the "solitary horseman " made his first appearance in the lane. In a couple of- days the successful suitors all, departed for their respective homes, each well pleased with his visit; for it had been decided by each couple--and the old judge,: who had returned friom court during their visit, had ratified the decision when the important event of their lives should take place. The first, that of Catharine, the oldest daughter, was fixed for the ensuing autumn; that ,of the youngest, Margaret, in the spring; while the marriage of Jane to Gomery of Montgomery was to be deferred some six months later. As it is not within the scope of this work to follow the fortunes of these city people farther than may be necessary to the history of the family fortunes of Gomnery of Montgomery and his wife, the preceding incidents have been related only. to show how it: came to pass that they lad so many relations of wealth and influence in the large comlmercial cities. At a future time we- shall see, perhaps, how the family affairs were affected by this circumstance. In after-years, on the occaision of that good old :New- England festival, the annual Thanksgiving, it was a duty that the old judge exacted from his daughters, that -at least one of them should return to the old homestead, :and pass it with him. This duty was always cheerfully fulfilled; and, one year,- at, the instance of the old man, the thnee   1'92      GOMERY OF MONTGOMBRY returned and sat round the hearthstone, each with her hus- band and" children, and listened to the tremurlouls voice of tlhe aged patriarch while lie r:ead from the same old fanmily Bible firom which, as cllildren, they had been wont to be taugtht at their mothler's knee. The changes that hid taken' place . during those few years, though regular and, in tlre gentle course of nature, had been great. The daughtels had all become rnatured and thougrhtful womeni; anid the men who had tormerly come a-wooing from the lare  cities were no longer engaged. or interested in the lighllt frippry of city snobs, but had become shrewd and thoilghltfill mnen of busi- ness. Happy and proud were the younc mothels retilrninog to the loved scenes of youth, and full of questions and curi- osity- were the youngerl folk to visit a place of which from their infancy they had heard so much. As in former days, the style of Gdmery's equipage, but poorly comported with that of his rich brothers-in-law. It was a plain covered wagon, drawn by a pair of stout farm-horses, and contained the whole family, consisting of Freeborn, his Wife, and lfour children. At first, when the city matlons saw the hopely carriage of their sister draw up, they felt for her a minled: sense of humiliatiomn and pity; but as they looked ilto her fresh, halpy face, and saw nothing but pride, joy, anld heallth, they could see that she neleded- or asked for no one's pity; and when, afterwardls the children were assembied togetlher in the parlor, the native superiority of lher chil dren was observed with a feeling, near akin, it may be presumed, to that of Cornelia when she exhibited her jewels. The tVwo daughters from the country even then gave promise of that rar1e beauty and sprightliness that in aftelr-years were to render them the queens of fashiond,and leaders of society, in their respective spheres. The city cousins were pale and pretty; the country lasses, blooming and beautiful. .The boys froml the country were rough, boisterous ,young fellows, clad in strong, qoarse cloth, that would bear vigorous exercise; arl, as soon as they could get away, they: were off among tile horses and cattle of their grandfather; andt not a little shocked- were their timid cou-sins to see them' mount t1ie horses barebaclk, and go scampering to the broqlh wlere the animals were accustomed to drink. It may and it maynot have occurred to the wife of Gomery of Montgomery that 'her lot was to be envied abdve that of her sisters; but it is   A A MLY HSTORY.        193 certain her beautiful face always had the look of cheerfulness land content. Time had made less impression on her than on them, and she retained more of her youthful vivacity and activity. Hers had certainly been the happier life thus far; and yet how few were wise enough to prefer her lot among the rustic -people of a country village to that of the city ma- trons, Mho participated in all the gayety of fashionable life, and had only to express a wish, aind, if money could effect it, it was gratified!  Freeborn Gomemry and his wife returned to their home in the country, and for years little occurred to vary the tranquillity of their lives. The only incident of impor- -- tance was the arrival of the third son, Walter, with whom my readers made a slight acquaintance some time ago. But ) at length it became necessary to decide what should be the future profession or occupation of the eldest of the three sons. He was nearly fitted for college; and, if he was going there,  it was best that he should enter at the approaching com- mencement. But he had more taste for business than litera- ture; and his mother, with quick intuition, saw that, where- as he would never excel in letters, le had all the qualities necessary to render him a most successful merchant or finan- cier. Indeed, he had shown signs of over-reaching ability far less displeasing to his mother than to his father. Now, it happened, that, while this matter was under dis- cussion, the first visit of Thomas Fogue and his wife and a younger son to the Pivot was made. It was in the autumn of the year; and the excursion was made partly for pleasure, and partly to improve the ailing condition of the younger member of the family. 'During this visit, the subject of Theron's education came up; and his uncle proposed that he should go to New York, and there learn the mysteries of banking and finance. ,The capitalist was honest and sensible in his advice. He said the secret of success was to know X and do every thing thoroughly; that the boy must begin at the foot of the ladder, and by experience, as he ascended, learn the routine and details of the entire business. He must accept of a very humble position at first, as it would be his duty to keep the house in order, and-do all sorts of odds-and- ends jobs that might be required. Afterwards, if found faithful and steady, and when he had learned to write a i                      .7.  . '    194       GOMERY OF'MO]TGOMERY: good hand, he would be promoted from one step to another as fast as he was fitted to perform its duties. This proposal was submitted to. Theron; and he eagerly jumped at it, for he was not at all inclined to a college course. It was accordingly determined, that, with the opening of the ensuing spring, he should go to New York, and, under the patronage of his ridh uncle, learn the arts and mysteries of financiering. The trials that he passed through in a strange city; his labors; his rebuffs from his rdlations; the sneers and insults of city-born youths of his own ate, who jeered at his severe ideas, and laughed at his country manners, --were all endured manfully; but, as they were very similar to those endured- by thousands and thousands of country lads who go from the country into the cities to better their fortunes, it is not necessary to describe them here. It is sufficient at this time to state that he went forth an honest lad, determined to make his way in the world. With a natural tact for business, and born of such parents as Freeborn Gomery and his wife, it will be strange if he does not achieve a success far beyond his youthful expectations. But that must be years hence; and, as he has nothing to do with this history for some time to come, we will, if the reader does not object, now return to the principal characters.

Is not the truth the truth "- FALSTAFF, Two years passed away, after the abrupt departure of  Joe Pumpagin from Montgomery, before that worthy re- turned to look after his firiends and namesakes. By this time the anger of the deceived parents had cooled off; and even the injured mothers, who at first were so wildly furi- ous, admitted that it was a good joke which he had played them. Yet, as the presents that he had promised to the little  darlings had never been frthcoming, the names given them by him had not been retained. This time, Joe made his ap- pearance in very different trim from whathad beerin his wont on former occasions. He had usually come trudging into the village tired, footsore, dusty, and ragged; and it was only after heehad visited his old friend Tench Wales, to divide with- him his scanty wardrobe, that he ventured to show himself about the village, and relates his wonderful adventures, andl set the old people to doubting, and the young ones to mar- velling, at the strange stories he told.  On this occasion, Joe returned in the depth of winter (it being the last day of December when the stage drove up to the door of the Egle), and was met as usual -by little Diller himself, who came running to the door. Pushing back the curtains of the covered sleigh, he saw that there was but one passenger, and that was his old customer, Joe Purpeagin. He hardly knew whether to feel glad or.,sorry at the appear- ance of this doubtful advantage to his 'house. Yet he' was so in the habit of welcoming eyerybody with Cordial words, that it is doubtful, if the Devil himself had drive v up to the door, and the first foot pt fromuthe carriage had been cloven, whether he would not have helped him out withh great politeness, and said he was glad to see him, that he. He hardly knew whether to feel glad orsorry at tjhev appears'  ante of this doubtful advantage to- his house. Yet Sex   i96      GOMRY ' o MONTGOMERY ': should be proud of-the honor of attending-to his wants, and, that his wife knew how to set the best table and keep the best taveirn between Boston and Canada. Such was the wel- come that from habit he gave to Joe Pumpagin; and the weary traveller stepped from the sleigh to the house, direct- ing that his baggage should be brought in. Several old vet- erans of the place, who had known Joe well in former times, were seated in the bar-room at the time he entered, smoking their pipes, and discussing the late peace. But they hardly knew him, he looked so spruce and well-to-do. Instead of the rusty garments of former times, he had on an overcoat of stout yet fine beaver-cloth, with a fine fur collar, a fur cap, and a pair of fur mittens. His boots were new, thick, and warm; and his red nose peeped through :the upturned collar, while farther back his merry eyes twinkled expressively as he witnessed the surprise depicted on the faces of his old ac- quaintances at his unusual as-well as unexpected appearance. His old enemy, Spinney the doubter, was the first to recognize him, and exclaimed, "It's Joe Pumpagin, by the iVt- ing hokey! How are you, tluthful Joseph?" "Well and hearty,' said Joe, extending his hand first to Spinney, and then to all the others. "Never better. Had greatluck this time. Seen strange, sights. l/Have seen the Devil sure enough, and had a fight with him, and am none the worse for it. Money enough. Look a-here! I never used to wear such clothes as these.

I have just come back here for a few days to take a look at my namesakes, and see- how their mothers get on. By the way, Homer, how is my godson? Of course you called him after Old Joe." rI'd sooner 'ave named him the Devil!!" said Homer, net- :tled at the question, and more nettled at the shout it had provoked. ' All right," said Joe. - 'If you prefer to name him after some of his relations, instead of me, it's no affair of mine. What is his name, if not Joe?"  ;"Obededom." "(chedte-dom,-Obededom  Homer. Well, I can't -say N   A FAMLY HSTORY.        197 but it was a scurvy trick I played him. But no m atter for that now, Let us have something warm. Come, boys, what will you all take?" ' Diller heard this proposition with fear and trembling. "Perhaps," thought he, "he can pay the old bill now; and, if can't, he never can; and it is as well to stop it from grow- ing anylarger first as last.-Mr. Joe," said he timidly, "be- fore we open another account, I guess we'd better settle up the old one. Here it is, scored down on the wall inside the bar just after you left; and you can see it for yourself. 'Joe Pumpagin, Dr. to Artemus Diller, $21.87 1-2 cts'"  "That all? Well, here, count it out," said he, giving him a bag of coin weighing at- least two pounds. "Take your pay." Diller took the bag, and, thrusting in his hand, pulled out a handful of gold and silver, the gold predominating. The others gathered round in su'prise; while Joe, who' had lit his pipe, sat smoking by the fii'e in apparent unconcern. The host of the Eagle counted out the amount of his own demand, and from such coin as he knew. the value of; for the most of it was of strange, outlandish dies such as he had never seen before. Giving back the purse to the owner, he said, "Mr. Pumpagin"  he had never been known to dig- nify him before by any title but Joe, or Old Joe,-"I have got some .good Jamaica, good New-England, first-rate 'Santa Cruz, and some stunnin' brandy." "Well, it's my treat. ' Give the boys all they want, and the best you have got."        l "Philemon," says Diller to a tall, raw youth, who was sery- ing at the Eagle in the treble capacity of stable-boy, errand- boy, and butt folr everybody to,scold at, "-r Philemon, bring in some hot water. PerlhapsSie - Mr. Pumpagin - would like suthin' warm, as he has been riding all day, and itis a proper cold night.'  "Yes: get us a big pitcher of flip,-'hot flip. Put in plenty\of nutmeg, and be sure you make it strong." '"It shall be done, Mr. Pumpagin," said -Diller; "though there hain't beeen a mug of flip made in this house, now it's more than two year ago, since you left. But the-old flip-dog is there in the cupboard. Philemon, get it out, can't you, you stupid, and put it in the fire! - No matter now about the hot water; but go and bring up some bel; you fool! Here, take '" .  ,   17* '   198     GOMEY -OF MONTGOMERY:  my key, and go down Cellar to the closet; and mind you don't touch none of that brandy. That brandy cost me fif- teen shillin' a-gallon." Away went Philemon, having first thbrust the heavy end of the flip-dog into the bed of-coals glowing under the fore. stick. The company impatiently awaited the preparation. When' Philemon returned with the bottles of beer, Joe, who had by this time got warmed, threw off his -overcoat, and, as was his wont in times long agone, proceeded to make the flip. His' dark sea-browned arnd sun-browned counte- nance shone bright and red; his little snub-nose, that turned up below the broken bridge so as to look like a huge wart, with holes on the lower side of it, seemed gratefully to inhale the aroma of the various ingredients. The beer was poured into a deep pitcher, and to that was added the Jamaica rum; then a large lump of loaf sugar; and lastly a nutmeg- or,- as Joe called it, gimlet handle "--was rasped over it. Joe then advanced, and, seizing the long handle of the flip-dog, drew the knob, now of the color of the coals, so white and bright that it dazzled the eyes of the expectant spectators, and made the face of Old Joe as radiant as that of a trans-' lated saint. "Not too hot," said Joe: "burn the beer." Then, swing- ing it back and forth for a few times till it became of a heavy ired, he plunged it into the still foaming mixture, that sizzled and sozzled and hissed and spluttered; while the steam, ascending around the rubicund face of Joe, gave it an appearance "round and red as the harvest-moon through lthe mist of the marshes." -The flip -was now pronounced imade, and the glasses, that Diller had taken care to have warm to prevent cracking, were set out upon the table. Joe filled them to the brim, and then told all to help them- selves. Foremost to doshis was Nat Dobble, the acknowl- -edged soaker, idler, and sot of the village. Quickly seizing a glass, he raised it to his mouth, not reflecting, in his haste, that the same mouth that could swallow fourtlh-proof " white eye" without flinching would not be equally insensible to boiling flip. He was in such haste, that half his allowance was down his throat before heywas aware ofihis error; and Joe, who had seen his greedy and dangerous haste, quietly remarked, "It is hot,"   A FAMLY HSTORY.        199 (' Oh, ugh, ugh!" spluttered out Nat; "I've found it out;" casting, at the salme time, a quantity of the scalding fluid recklessly from his mouth, so that it fell upon the new win- ter suit of Joe's ever-doubting enelny, Spinney. "There," says Joe; "I just told ye that all unbelievers/ should have their part; and you've got yours, and more- too. Fulfilment of Scripter. There shall be weeping, and gnash- ing of teeth. Just look at Nat! See the tears!, Ain't thlat weeping? And see Spinney gnash his teeth because his clothes are spilt on!"' The others were seated round with their glasses, all laugh- ing at the expense of Nat and Spinney, and sipping their flip with evident delight; and it was not long before Spinney became much mollified,-- the warm mixture, that he sipped down seeming to thaw o0ut from  his frigid nature the latent humors of his body, that, in their turn, lubricated the social enginery of his system, and set in full flow the ideas long congealed in his brain, that now ran glibly and kindly from his usually caustic tongue. Nat Dobble, who had been so cruelly cheated out of- his first glass, escaped from the gibes of his companions to the door, and cooled his mouth with a handful of snow; and then, taking:another handful, he made it into a hard ball, and returned w;;ith it to the -bar- . room; and, as the pitcher was yet far from' empty, he filled his glass, and slyly dropped his snow-ball into it,..and then took off the hot flip, iced, to his evident satisfaction. He then filled his glass a third time, when his thirst was so far ap- peased that he was content to sip slowly like the others, and in the mean while discuss with them the merits of the con- coction. All said it was good, though it did not quite suit the-palate of either.. One said it was too strong; another, that a drop more of the Jamaica would have improved it; still another said it was too sweet; another, that it was too bitter. Nat said it was too hot. All agreed that it was too soon gone; and straightway Joe set himself to the prepara- tion of another pitcherful. In the mean while, good Mrs. Diller had prepared an excellent supper in the dining-room, to which he paid his respects while his friends were :discuss- ing the second pitcher of flip. He returned to them as soon as he had testified to his approval of Mistress Diller's re- past, and found that the pitcher was again empty. The company by this time-were in excellent humor, and Joe .be-   200      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY:. gan totell of hisadventures while away during the two years since his last departure. " Yoou see," said he, addressing himself particularly to Tom Homer, " being a man of my word, and having promised so many presents to my namesakes, and those of my sister Nancy, who died in the poor-house, I thought I must go and look after my property off to the westward; and then I thought, too, that may-be I would go and look after my estate in- England, and see if I was a lord yetj or only plain Joe Pum- pagin. But, when I got so near as to smell the salt water, I'm 'staggered if I didn't give up all thoughts of my imlportapt  interests,?and ship as second mate o'n board a ship bound to Matanzas. Our vessel was a tidy little brig called the Lovely Ann ;' and ve had been out about a week, when we were overtaken by a squall, that, at'the first gust, carried away our jib-boom, and took off half our mnen, who were just then furling the sails with all haste. Our skipper had come in through the cabin-window, as his falther owned the vessel, and the first mate was sick in the cabin with the fever. So the cap'n, when he seen the devil was to pay, says he to me, 'Mr. Pumpagin,I'll jist go down and make up the reckoning, and you looktd the ship.' Now, as we had not seen the sun for three tays, and had been running all the While at twelve knotst an hour by, dead reckoning, and our compass was out of order and wouldn't move, and the chronometer had run down, I was curious to know how he was going to make up the reckoning. He was a poor noddy, always swearing at-the men in fair weather; and to me and the other mate he was always telling what great things he had done in other ships, with mutinous crews, and amid de- stroying hurricanes: but now his face was as pale as Desde- mona's after that black fellow Othello had choked her- to death. He gave me a look so despairing and cowardly, that I laughed in his face. Directly the, first mate, having- heard the crash on deck, and knowing there must be some fun go- ing on on deck, crawled out, sick as he Was; and, going for- 'ard, an-awful wave dashed over us, and took himi off, and two more of the men-. "(This must be stopped,' said the cap n, crouching between the hen-coop and clothes-line on which the, sailors' clothes were-hung a-drying. ' Can you pray?  '"Got no time for it,' says I. '   '    A FAMLY HSTORY.        201 "' But something must be' done; for this thing must be stopped, I say.' "'-Thatis just what the man said when the doctor told him his wife had had the third baby. But how to do it is the devil of it.'-' It must be stopped,' says'the cap'n again. ' Yes,' says I; ' but, as the doctor said, how the devil to do it."' - "I believe every word of it," said Spinney. "But you \ wouldoblige me ift' you would just tell how it was that the hen-coop, and line full of clothes, was left, seein' as how the hurricane carried off the rasts, mate, and men." "Do you think I had any -time to look after hen-coops in such a gale as that?" answered Joe indignantly. "No, sir: I had the ship to look out for, and keep her afloat; for just then the cap'n bolted into the cabin; and, when I looked down about two minutes after, I saw him drop on his knees, and begin, c Now I lay me down to sleep.'- 4 That ain't the way!' I sung out to him at the top of my voice. 'How is it, then?' said he: 'you come and lend a hand., You begin; and you can just say to the Lord for me, if he will only get me safe out of this 'ere, I'll- never ask him for any thing again.'-' Can't illdorse for you, cap'n,' says I. .'Draw your own bills. You know you are an awful liar, and you can't' take me in in that way.' Just then came. another crash, and the masts all went by the board; the rudder was kn'ocked all to shivers; and every man aboard ship was swept off, except the cap'n, and me. , The cap'n was now so scared, that he fell over in a fit. I left; him, to go on deck, when I found the wind blowing at the rate of a knot a minute." "I believe'every word of it," said Spinney. "Believe it, or not, do you see that?" said he, pointing to - 'the top of his head, which formerly had a thick growth of hair upon it, but was now as bald as a turnip. "It blew so, that it took every hair out of my head. On the top it never grew again. At last, I saw we were being driven full head, on a rloclky shore; -and, as we neared the land, I caught sight of a little cove that made up between two large rocks. By: putting the helm hard a-port at the nick of time, I managed to throw the ship on top of a big wave into this cove; and she settled hard and dry on a sand-bank." "I believe every word of it,"said Spinney;-" but how did you put fhe helm a-port when the rudder had been, all knocked to shivers?"   !202      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY ; "Do you think I could stop to mend the rudder when we were driving full-head on a rock-bound coast'?" triumphant- ly responded Joe.            /    I "No sooner did the cap'n feel that the ship was safe and hard a-ground than he came on deck to see how to get from the ship. But, as every minute a huge wave rolled in that ,made the stern of the ship bob up and down like a cork in a boiling kettle, he was afraid to make the attempt alone; and says' he to me,' Mr. Pumpagin, can you swim? '-Like, a duck,' sas I. Well, says I 'Well,' says he, 'take me on your baclk, and -a quarter of the cargo is yours.'-Agreed,' says I; and, let- ting ourselves down firom the side, I took the scared-to-death lobster on my back; and, as the great Shakspeare says, 'As AEneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves'-- E did I the skipper of the 'Lovely Ann.' I had just struck off - I "On the sandbank??" interrogated Spinney. "Don't bother me, Mr. Spinney, if you please! My story is all true." "I believe every word of it." "I was saying," continued Joe," I had just struck off when a big wave came bouncing in, and carried us both out to sea. 'Now, says I to myself, 'Old Joe, "there is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune:" that's what Shakspeare says; and I guess it's high tide for me just now.' So says I, 'Cap'n, you're getting heavy; and I'm afraid I must drop you.' H Oh, lordy! oh, don't! ' says he. ':Save me, and half the cargo is yours.' -' All right,' says I, striking for the shore. 'But tow,' thinks I,' here am I, Joe Pumpagin, without-a cent to bless myself with.' " 4' Except the property to the west'ard," interrupted Homer. "And the estate in England,'5 added Spinney. "Ah! that was all intended for my namesakes. But, as I was saying, here was I, Old Joe, without money, and with mighty low credit at the Eagle; and this cap'n has lots of money, and a rich old father owning a whole fleet of ships: and, if I save his life,'he must pay for it. So I says again, 'Cap'n, I shall have to drop you.'-' Oh, don't!' 7 says he, clinging tighter and tighter: ' don't, and you shall have three-  .  .               .   A FAMLY HSTORY.        203 quarters.' -' All right,' says I;' but why shouldn't I drop you, and take the whole?'--' You may have the whole,' he , whined piteously; ': only bring me safe to shore.'-'It's a bar- gain!' said I, striking lustily for the shore, which II reached in about five minutes. We had not been long ashore when we knew   were in a hot climate; for the rays of the sun scorched us like Nat's flip scorched hi s mouth just now." "Did the storm continue?" said Nat Dobble, "Yes: it lasted three days and nights; and at last, when it abated, the old ship was high and dry on the land. Now, as the ship and cargo were all mine, I hired the cap'n to work for me as clerk; but, as ihe had begun swearing again as sodn as he got on shore, I told -him to stop it -or every tinme he swore I should dock off ninepence of his wages. The first day brought him two and thrippence in my debt; and it was only when I gave him a taste of the rope's end, that he quit, and became a very respectable man and good citizen."' I believe every word of it," said Spinney. "The flip-dog will all be burnt up if we wait,to hear any more of your infernal lies," said Nat, who grew surly as he grew drunk.    , "Every word true," said Spinney. "I saw that cap'n af- terwards, and he told me the same story," "That can't be true; for he was lost on his voyage home," replied Joe.  "Then it was his brother." "Ah! very likely: he said he had a brother that looked just like him. But let us have more flip. Here, -the dog is red,- as red as Spinney's nose.", As this member of the doubter's physiognomy was noted for its high color, which people whispered came out of a pri- vate decanter, he did not at all like this comparison; but as Joe was preparing the third mug. of flip, to which he was not disinclined to pay his reispects, he thought it not a favorable time to, insist on his teinperate habits. The flip was made as before, and each one sat down to sip the palate-tickling compound. Joe, with his glass in his hand, then resumed his narrative.           -  "When the storm had abated, I sent my clerk to look about, and learn where 'we were. He soon returned, and re- ported that, there was a large city not more than six miles off: so we put on our. best clothes, and went to visit the   204      GOMERY OF' MONT'GOMERY:"  town, and see what we could do with the cargo. The name of the ,town was Krampagoola;, but I have never been able to .meet with anybody who had been in the place before or since, and it is not laid down on any map or chart. I have made great inquiries of other celebrated travellers like my- self about it; but nobody seems to have heard of such a place."             ^          . "I think Gulliver mentions it," said Spinney.   / "The people were all fine-looking; the men being all stout and graceful like myself, and the women were all much handsomer than Square Gomery's wife was when she first. came to this village. I soon sold the cargo,- for ten thousand dollars, to a rich merchant; and, not to be hard on the cap'n, I gave him five hundred dollars to get home with. But he niever got home, as the ship was lost, and all on board per- ished. It was the English brig 4 Rover,' Cap'n Bluster."' "I believe every word of it. I met Cap'n Bluster afterr wards, and he told me the same story." 4 The merchant that bought the cargo," resumed Joe, "was richer a hundred times than every man in this town put to- gether, including Gomery of Montgomery! He had a hun- dred horses, and a house as large as Mount Gomery, - I mean the hill. He had so many ships coming and going all the time,that it took a hundred clerks to take account of their cargoes; and he had two thousand slaves always at work loading and unloading!"              ; "I believe every word of it,"' said Spinney. "The merchant insisted that I should go to his house and stop while I remained in town; -and I went.- He had a beau- tiful daughter, who was an only child, and heir to all his property; and it was easy for me to see, that, from the first, the old man was determined to make al match between us. And the young woman, who was highly educated and accom- plished, and of exceeding fine taste, was of the same mind. lBut, as Shakspeare says, c the ,cours/e of true love never did aun smooth.' Tlhere was a gay cavalier near by, who had been trying to get a smile from her for years; and, when he saw me coming in and getting such great attention, he was jealous as a pet dog; for, as Shakspeare says, 'trifles light as air';- you know the rest, He was considered a famous horseman in those parts, and used to brag and boast .that he- could ride a whirlwind. But when I.. told what I had *  * ',         ,    A FAMBILY HSrTORY.       205 done; that I fought and killed single-handed, with these- two hands, the lions of Sahara; how that, being shipwrecked once, I had mountedl on the back of a big whale, and driven him into the harbor of New Bedford, where I sold his oil for six and ninepence a gallon, then my Desdemona would devour my discourse, as Shakspeare says; and the green- eyed monster--that's what Shakspeare calls it made him as mad as a live lobster in hot water. He said nothing, how- ever, 'but let concealment, like a worm in the bud' (you know how the great bard of Avon has it); and a few days after that, when we wyere both present, and I had been sing- ing to her and playing on the guitar, the young lady told us that the next day she was going to prove who was the best man. "' How?' said I, standing up, and putting my hand on my heart. 'Tell me any danger I would not encounter for my Betsey' (Betsey was her name, you know). ' If you bid me follow the tiger to his lair, to scale the heights of the preci- pice and rob the eagle of its young,/'command me, and either the young tigers and eaglets shall be yours, or your slave shall be a bleeding corpus at your feet.' "'Oh, tut!' said she: 'nothing of that kind. My father has bought me a pony that nobody yet call ride. It is fleet as the wind, and wild as the chamois. It is more beautiful than the:lily, the flamingo, or the soft texture of the tiger's skin. Who first rides and subdues this steed, and brings him sub- missive to my hand, he that hand may claim.: "The cavalier, whose name was Don Frederico Antonio Bombasto Gumbo, sprang up at the word, and, in a voice quaking with emotion, exclaimed, 'To-morrow I claim the test!'               .       - "' I give the-rash booby the first chance,' said I, and retired with a lofty disdain, receiving an admonition fromn the sweet Betsey to be on the ground at nine o'clock in the morning to witness my rival's triumph or discomfiture. ' "I was there at the hour. The vain Don Gumbo, booted and spurred, with a riding-whip in his hand, was walking up and down in firont of the house; while, on a balcony above, sat the divine Betsey. As I appeared, and walked up to- wards the don, he cast upon me such a lobk of rage and hate as he supposed would knock me down. But I returned it withl a. look of such withering defiance and contempt, that, hi,^    '!1         ' ,  . .    206      GOMER-Y OF MONTGOMERY: had he been a gentleman of sensitive feelings, he would have sunk into the earth.  'Presently the gate of the stable-yard was opened, and the fiery steed was led forth. My, he- was a beauty! Two glrooms were at his head; and they could hardly hold him to thile ground. At first I could ,hardly believe it was a horse, so gra-ceful was its form, so light its tread, so beautiful its skin. He was striped like the zebra; the ground-work, of the purest white, being varied by serpent-like stripes of glossy black. The maneD was all white, the tail all black." "I've seen such firequently," said Spinney. ,  "Don Gumbo looked hard at the beast, and then, approach- ling, bounded to his back, and away he went, clearing fences and gates without an effort. 'Follow him,' said Betsey to the grooms. lIey hurried to the stables; and, having got out their own nags, were just mounting, when the striped pony came dallncing back over the fence into the yard, laving spilled his rider in the mean while. He was led submissive  to the stable, and the groomns wpnt to look for the fallen cavalier. They found him vlyingr senseless at a sholrt distance fromrn the house, and carried him back, and laid lim pn a bed; and it was two weeks befolre .he became conscious. In his ravings, he used to swear all sorts of vengeance on Don Hozay, as he called me.' "At length he was no longer hors dzu cornbat, as the Frentch say, but was able to witness my tlrial of the fiery beast. By great good luck, there came on a tlremendous snow-storm the ,night before I was to show nmy skill in horsemanship. The snow, in the morning, lay damp and heavy, two feet and a half deep; and in some parts of the yard, wthelre it has drifted, itwasfive feet deep. Betsey stood ather window aove, looking out on the scene. Don Gum- bo stood below, looking glum and savage. Tle horse was brought out, and he was even more fiery and mettlesome than on the previous molning. He was led up to where I stood; when, seizing the reins, I jumped upon his back, 1nd by a quick jerk bronglit his head round towards the deepest slow, when I plunged the spurt into-his sides. At the first bound, he jumped lilll thirty feet, and landed in four feet of snow. Again he&'rade a spring; but this time-his bound was less. I held him up firmly towards the deepest snow-banks; and the way he floundered and plunged was right curious to   A FANMLY HSTORY.       207 behold. But he soon learned he had a master; and then, bringing hirl up to a place where the snow was not so deep, I jumped him over the fence, and galloped away for a good three hours, at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour. At - length he owned himself mastered, and trotted away, broken and submissive. I then concluded it was time to retulrn; but, thinking it might be too hard on the horse to ride him so far without baiting, I called up to a farm-house by the roadside, -and .-asked the farmer if he could give my horse some oats. "'Not an oat,' said he. "' Have you any hay, then?'  "No hay neither,' said he. "'Well says I, "there is a good field of grass: will you lend me a scythe to go and cut a baiting for my horse if I pay yor the worth of it?'    - "' How much might that be?' said he. "' Well, I reckon about two and thrippence.' - "All right-' said he; and off lie went and brought me a bra:n new scythe, made by Joy & Sons, Providence: and in a sholrt tinme I had a stout handful of grass befolre the noble beast; and he took hold of it right heartily, I tell ye." "I believe every word of it; but where was the snow all the while?" said Spinn-ey. "Oh! I forgot to say it was in a hot country, and the snow melted. "4 That explains it," said Spinney. "I thiinE a little more fip would make it clearer," said Nat Dobble. 'I think so too," saidJoe. "Let us have another pitcher;" and he at once commenced preparing it.  "When I returned," he resumed, "Miss Betsey stood on the steps of the piazza -smiling and pleased; and she looked- oh, how beautiful! Why, Gomnery's wife, in her best days was no more to be compared to her than a three-legged milkin g- stool to the throne of Great Britain! Gumbo sat in a chair on the stoop, fanning himself, and looking black enough to turn milk sour. A  thundercloud was nothing to him. Betsey had a  nosegay in her hand as large as a peck basket, which she placed in her bosom as I approached." "Commodious bosom!" said Nat. "She extended both hands to me at once; and then, tak- , * 3                ' ' I    208       GOMERY -OF 'MONTGOMERY : ing thie flowers from their delicate resting-place, she gave them to me with a look and a smile that said, as plainly as words, ' The prize you have won, - it is yours: take it and wear it!' Falling-on one knee, I took the bouquet, and held it to my nose for a moment." "Such a nose!" muttered Nat. "Thenr seizings her hand, which she did not hold back, I covered it with kisses firomn my lips." -"I hope there was no tobacco-juice on them," said Nat. "'Is not the truth the truth?' as Falstaff says. At that moment, I considered miy fortune made; and as I rose up, and turned to depart, my eyes met those of Gumbo, and such a look of scorn and contempt as no other man ever saw, and lived." "I believe it," said Spinney. "That evening I received a message from the merchant, Betsey's father; that he would be glad. to see me, at eight o'clock, in his private parlor. Of course, I knew what his business was. It was to make arran'gements for the great affair,- the wedding. So, happy fellow that I was, I got mIy- self up in my best clothes, and was all on tip-toe for the hour; for Betsey had -also sent word, that, when I was through with my business with the old man, she would ex- pect me in the grand parlor, and there would be no other company. I thought eight 'o'clock would never come.' I was ready for the fray; and it was only six and a half, and thie sun Was barely down. So I thought to; kill an hour by a walk anlong the orange-groves 'in ithe garden. Taking a good stiff drink of grog, and stowing a big quid of tobacco into my mouth, I sallied forthh, and was thinking how that, some day, all these things would be mine. But, just as I was' coming out fiorn a thick clump of pomegranate-bushes, who should I meet but Don Gumbo, with his sword drawn, and his eyes flashing fire!" "Villain!" said he: "you die!" "You don't tell me that," said I carelessly, -and making as if to pass on. "At that lie made a thrust at me, which I caught on, the fleshy part of my left fore-arm; and Know, being convinced that he was a man without principle, and really meant to in- sult me, I let out the clinched knuckles of my right mauler, - that hit him fair and plump on the bridge of his nose. That   A PAMtY HSTORY.        209 prominent feature of his handsome face was rendered unfit either for ornament or use by": the blow; for I h,eard the bones, of his head craunch in as I have heard the frozen ground under a cart-wheel. He fell as motionless as any ox you ever knocked on the head with a narrow axe, 'Bijah Gordon. My arm was bleeding fast; and I have the scar now where the rascal run it through." - Joe here took off his coat, and, rolling up his shirt-sleeve, showed a large scar, that several witnesses, who had often seen him in former times with his sleeves rolled up, said was not there two years before, when he was last in the village. "Now," said he triumphantly to Spinney, "you will believe it, won't you?" "I believed it before, every word of it," said the doubter, "especially about the snow-storm and the grass-cutting." "All alike triue," said Joe. "He's a villain that doubts it," said Dobble. "But, wasn't I in a pretty fix then? Gumbo belonged to one of the first families, and had a great many friends; and,  if it became known that I had killed him, nothing would save me. So I stole out of the garden, and, running down to the bay or harbor of the town, I found the ship ' Hurricane,'  Cap'n Tarbox, was to sail the next morning at day- light. Only the day before I had put my money on board the ' Hurricane,' to be taken to New York; and I wrote to my agent there to have it divided among my namesakes. It amounted to nine thousand dollars, being the amount I had ' left from the proceeds of the 'Lovely Anin.' I had spent a good deal courting Betsey. Courting is very expensive in that country. On board the ship, I wrote a letter to Bet- sey, explaining to her why I had left her so strangely, and sent it on shore by the pilot. So, when I got to New York, I found, as the result of my voyage, that I had nine thousand dollars in gold doubloons." "' And what became of the poor girl?" inquired Abijah Gor- don, who had listened all through the long story with an in- terest that showed he believed every word of it. "Oh! she died in a mad-house. At least, she wrote to me that she intended to if I did not go back; and her father he wrote to me, that, to save my character, they had hired a slave, on the promise of freedom,'to own that he had killed Gumbo, and then they hung him to make all safe. He begged pe 18*         -   210      O GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY : 'to              *e- .'A    ote to return, and save the life of his daughter Betsey. Another letter came soon after, saying she was dead, and that she had died in a mad-house, without the aid of a physician." "A little crack-brained before, perhaps," said Nat. "And what became of the old man?" said Abijah. "He died too. While I Vlas there, I had shokwed him how to make flip, and he loved it powerful; and, when I was gone, he took to flip, and drank so much that/it flipped him over, and he was buried by the side of Betsey. This is a warn- ing to you all to beware of flip; for, as. Shakspeare says; , It is strange that a man should put an enemy into his mouth to steal away his brains.' But here the pitcher is out again: we must have some more." The company were all in too maudlin a state to object to this last proposition; and Philemon, or, as Joe called him, the Kurnill, wasrdespatched to the cellar to bring up more beer, and-the flip-dog was again thrust into the coals. Little Dil- ler was getting anxious about the good name of his house; while Spinney was become as amiable and happy as Tamn O'Shanter on the evening of4 that fearful ride when his gray mare Meg distanced the witches, "leaving behind her oin gray tail." He was equally urn mindful as Tamn of one who sat at home," nursing her wrath to keep it warm." The next pitcher of the insinuating flip was prepared by Joe, who, with a roguish design on Spinney, poured into it double the usual amount of spirit; and, when each had refilled: his glass from this stronger preparation, Joe asked them for theirf opinion upon it. Spinney said it had a finer flavor than the last; so did Nat: and they both evidenced that they thought so by draining their glasses as soon as the high temperature of the mixure would permit, and immediately refilling them. Diller himself was fast getting over his anxiety for the repu- tation of the Eagle-, and was so happy, that he proposed, to drink the health of the distinguished traveller, Mr. Joseph Pumpagin. "Bumpers!" said Nat; and he and Spininey filled their glasses once more.               \ By this time, Spinney was thoroughly amiable; and, advan- cing towards Joe, he extended his hand, and said, 'Mr. Pumpagin, here is my hand, and I accept your 'pology.. No, you accept my 'pology. I didn't mean nothing when I kept saying,' I believe every word oof it.' I say it was all true;   A FAMLY HSTORY.        2" and any man who says Joe Pumpagin ain't a man of truth, then:I am ready to fight him!" To this Joe'responded by giving his hand; when Spinney closed by giving him a hug, and then, stepping back, unfor. tunately made a misstep, lost his balance, and fell on the floor. His glass, flying front his hand and striking the hearth, broke into a thousand pieces. Nat Dobble advanced, and, with benevolent intentions, stooped to assist the doubter to rise; but, not carefully balancing himself, he fell over the prostrate Spinney, his head striking the hearth among the frag- ments- of his. friend's tumbler, so violently, that he rolled over insensible upon the flooi; with the blood oozing from a dozen wounds in his face. Little Diller now rushed forward to their relief: but, at the instant of his approach, Spinney chanced to throw out one leg; and, his heavy boot striking-the spindle-shanks of the landlord, he, too, fell over, and neither , of the three had the power to rise4 Two others, less intoxi- cated; now rushed in-: but so vigorously did Diller and -Spin- ney strike out with their feet and hands, that they, too, were soon sprawling on top of the heap; and the whole five were piled up like a nest of snakes, all intertwisted, heads and points, and unable to extricate themselves. Joe looked at this interesting group with a complacent chuckle, and then, drawing forth his pipe from his pocket, sat down, and began to smoke with an air of indifference. Those present who had not got entangled in the human jumble on the floor quickly left the room, and went home. And now Philemon, coming to the rescue of his master, drew him forth, and thrust him into the kitchen, where his good wife was in a terrible state of perturbation, as the last scene in the bar-room  had been attended with such a clatter and tumult as to- seriously alarm her lest the good name of the hotel should be prejudiced. But the sight of Diller as he was thrust through the doorway by Philemon, his hair all dishev- elled, his coat torn, and his-whole appearance that of maud- lin drunkenness, raised this good woman's temper to a pitch of fury., "Ah !" said she, " this is the way you keep your tavern, is it? And all because that low fellow, Joe Pumpagin, has comie back!"          ; Here Philemon closed the door; and what more passed between this usually happy and loving icouple has never'to 'v       212      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: i this day been revealed. All extricated themselves from the floor,;and left the house, except Spinney and Nat: they both lay in a drunken sleep. Joe now toqko a candle, and,d knowing where the best chamber and bed were, went up stairs, and, without leave, took possession of this room; though in former days he had never been allowed to lookl towards solexclusive, an apartment, which was reserved only for the most distinguished guests. Here, between the whi- test sheets, and on a bed, of the lightest live-geese feathers, he was soon sleeping off the effects of his rpotations of flip.  A little before sunrise the next morning, Spinney was seen stealing from the house homeward, followed, half an hour af- ter; by Nat Dobble; and from that day, for many years, the adventures of that night'formed an epoch in the town his- / tory. For a time, it completely cast in the shade the "great baby ball," as it was called; and was always spoken of as the- "'great drunk." Spinney was not seen at the Eagle again during the winter; and when, a month later, he met Joe in the street, who asked him why he did not call in again, and take a, glass with his old friends at the tavern, hereplied,' "he had abandoned the follies and vices of this world, and, besides, was busy getting up his winter firewood." "I believe every word of it," said Joe. , . I   "   ,      ,    A FAMTLY HSTORY,          213 trut he was a stane    rd  t ,      ,           f' Fond of each gentle and each dreadful scene.

E'en sad vicissitude amused his soul; And if a sigh would sometimes intervene, And down his cheek atear of pity roll, A sigli, a tear, so sweet, he wished not to control." -BEATTIBE THAT Joe Pumpagin had;returned with his pockets full of money was soon known to every one in the village of Mont- gomery.   But that the whole story of the sea-voyage was an entire fiction, as well as the transparent parts of it, very few had any doubt. It was the only account, however, that he ' would .give of the way he had obtained his money; and so people were left in curious   perplexity in regard to him. Some even whispered that he must be either a pirate or a burglar, and, having made a haul, had come to Montgomery to  spendlit, safe from the clutches of the law. But no one who knew him believed any thing of this kind, as he seemed always so careless and jolly, either with or without-money, that it was an evident absurdity to connect him with any thing  like violence or crime. A more plausible theory, and one  mrore generally accepted, was, that he was connected with some wealthy family, and had probably inherited '. for- tune; and, in support of this opinion, his playful allusions to his estate in England, and his boast to the confiding mothers at the great ball that he would one day be a lord, were quot- ed as proof. But his money, owever obtained, was always current at the Eagle; and he was no longer an unwelcome sitter in the. chimney-corner of Diller's bar-room.   He paid all his bills promptly, and spent more money at the bar than all the vil-- lage besides.  His old friend, Tench Wales, was now remem- Th soth' 'u difsdhs azigsen   214      GOMERY OF MOXTGOMERY:     I bered; and Joe bought him two cows and a small flock of sheep; besides which he ordered a carpenter to renovate his house, holding himself responsible for the job. Tench was as fond of flip as Joe, though he was not often at,the tavern; 'and preferred a quiet mug at his own house, of a cold night, -when the winds were merry. Except when Joe was thus engaged, there was scarce an evening during that winter that the flip-dog at the tavern was not in requiisition. ' Though Joe's education was not of a high order, he, never- theless, could read; and his reading, though not taking an extensive range among authors, was well selected; for he read only one book, and that book, as may be inferred from bhis frequent quotations, was Shakspeare. In some of his early adventures, he had visited the theatres, not only in the, large cities of his own country, but in those of England, and had seen the best of actors, and been so impressed with the renderings of the great bard by some of the eminent tra- gedians, that he took to studying the text, and found it such a mine of intellectual treasures, practical wisdom, and flow- ers of fancy, that he read it and read it, year after year, till it was as familiar to him as was ever the Bible to Puritan or Covenanter. In the use of the pen, his-knowledge was very limited; at least, it was supposed to be so by the good people of Montgomery; for, whenever his autograph had been required, it was always found that he had a middle name, the first letter of which was X: and, from the knowledge of this fact, some of his listeners at the Eagle were inclined to doubt whether he ever wrote that letter to Miss Betsey of which he had boasted at " the great drunk." But envious minds are always carp- ing, and genius is ever exposed to the shafts of common- place. During the wfinter of Joe's return, he enjoyed his ease and comfort at the Eagle. He was somewhat erratic in his life, having many confidences with the town's-people, and espe- cially with Tench Wales and his wife. If a fat turkey or brace of chickens was to be :sold, he would not unfrequently buy them, and send them to his friends, and follow them at about the hour he knew they would be ready for theI table. As often as twice a week, he would set out early in the morn- ing for the old Gomery or Gault Farm upon the hill, and would niot return till near evening. He made the acqulaint- ance of Nathai Pratt, who had long been the upper-s:ervant   A FALMLY HSTORY.         215. 'or manager of the place, while his wife Jerusha was under- housekeeper to the overseeing and overruling Hulda ; and by a judicious use of his stories, and by sending- up every few days small presents of sea-shells or other cutiosities which he had picked up in his travels, and which he knew would be acceptable, and on one occasion the materials for. a new dress to Jerusha, wife of Nathan, he made himself se- cure of a hearty Welcome. Here it was his delight to talk' with those worthy people of the early history of the place, and fish up all the old traditions .that hung around it with their heavy shadows.- Nathan and his wife had heard, during -their residence there, all the marvellous tales of the place;- and, in her time, had often talked with old Lady Gomery of the dreadful Gault massacre. But she, as we saw long ago was a woman of too strong sense, too well informed, and of too philosophical a turn of mind, to attach any thing of a su- pernatural or miraculous character to the' phenomena which she had witnessed, but had explained them .to her own satisfaction by following to their legitimate conclusion the speculations of Mesmer and Franklin, that at a far later day were systematized and verified by Richenbach and his disci- . pies. But Joe was not 'so much interested; in the ghost sto, ries as he was in gathering up all the reports, rumors, and traditions that had ever circulated about the place in regard to the tragedy itself and the authors of it. 'The occurrence, at the time, had excited the horror and indignation of all who knew of it; and when the history of the war cam-e to be written out, and the official reports of all the different movements, successes, and disasters of the royal troops were published, Huldah Gomery, who   had sifted the evidence, more thoroughly than any one else, had made up her mind as to the guilty party. From  Nathan  and his wife, Joe learned what this good Woman had often said of& the affair, and that the leader of the murdering party was, in her opin. ion, a Col. -Cumberland: but whether the act were done by him, or by  one of his subordinates with his consent, or despite his authority, she did not pretend' to know; though her opinion was that it was the colonel himself, as the figure seen -in the apparition had always been a tall, handsome offl- cer in uniform. Thus the winter passed away, and Joe Puimpagin ePi oyIld  his ease and eomfort at the E age. He .ehtertte d the t:ra- ,  ,.    216      GOMEiY OF 'MOlNTGOMBRY  vellers with his strange stories, and the neighbors with hot grog. His face grew redder, his form more rotund, as the spring advanced; and in his visits he was always welcome, for he scattered his sixpences freely among the little folks, and praised them up to their mothers as juvenile paragons. But, niext' to Tench Wales and his wife, his most intimate jfriends were the occupants of the old Gomery Place on the hill; and between him and them there was a sort of Freema- sonry established, or rather an implied treaty of reciprocity, by which it was understood, that, while they were to relate to Jhim all the floating traditions of the place, he was to regale them with his still more marvellous adventures in countries not laid down on any map, nor mentioned in;any geography. The old log-house, the' one built by Gault, and which had been file habitation of Robert Go ery till the new one was built, pow stood a dishonored edifice being still used as a place of shelter for farming-tools and dilapidated furniture. It was even now said to be occasionally haunted; but, as the family made it a practice never to go near it during the tra- ditional hours when the ghosts were abroad, they could not tell whether they had revisited the pale glimpses of the moon during the last year. A little more than a year before, however, one of the, hired men, having returned from the village one hot July evening so intoxicated that he hardly knew what he did, staggered into it, and lay down on a pile of horse-blankets. There he had fallen asleep, but was soon after awakened by a horrid noise, and saw, as clear as daylight, the figure of a woman with her throat cut, and heard 'such scream's of a child that he durst not move nor speak till the apparition had disappeared, and the sounds of the child's voice receding in the distance could be no longer heard. Then, running to the door- of-the house, he raised the whole family by his shouts and clatter, and told of the dreadful. sights he had seen. This laborer had been on the place but a few days, and, never having heard of the Gault tragedy, was :not prepared for such sights. When he told his story, he was surprised at the cool way in which it was received. Nathan told him it was only the ghosts of the Gaults come back; and all went to bed again to sleep as undisturbed as -ever. But the witness of the scene did not sleep again that night, andcin the morning said he wanted to settle off and leave; for he was " afraid of them fellers that went about in Jove; or w, as               about, i n   A FAMLY HSTORY.?       217 the night with lanterns, cuttin' folks' throats just for takin' sathin' to warm the stomach." So he eft, and no more ghosts were seen or heard of till old Joe Pumpagin made his appearance on the hill. When Nathan asked him why he was so curious to kn6w all the freaks and fantasies of the ghosts, and all about the Gault history, he replied that he was of an inquiring turn of mind, and it was because of that that he had seen and learned so much, and was so full of knowl- edge. No ignorant man, he Said, could tell such stories as he could, and have them all true; and this was because he was so honest and particular always to wininow the wheat from the chaff, or truth from falsehood. Nobody, he said, could get round him with their big stories; and so, as he was never imposed upon by others, people might' depend on all he said to the smallest particular. In his visits at the hfl in former times, he had often met the children of Freeborn Gomery. But he never could have much intimacy with them in their grandmother's lifetime, as she had always looked upon. him as a disreputable character, having no employment, or means of support; and such a per- son she regarded as little better than a downright criminal, But in these later days, when the boys visited the hill, he soon found the way to their hearts by his voluble tongue, his strange adventures, and unceasing good nature. He was not only a favorite with the older boys, Theron and Wirt, who highly enjoyed his practical jokes, but with the youngest Walter, he soon established terms of the most confidential intimacy. He so amused them with his oddities and experi- ences, that they used to report them to their parents; and theiri reports confirming so well the testimony of Tench Wales in regard to his amusing character, in time Joe became as wel-. come a guest in the parlor of the Pivot as any man in the village; and, when more pretending visitors came to the house, the boys would steal away from the company of the parlor to sit on Joe's knees in the kitchen, and hear him tell of what he had seen "in his trips to the Moon,to Jupi, ter, Saturn, and the other West-India islands." Besides telling them stories, he made them kites and pop-guns; cross- bows and arrows, and an ingenious water-wheel, with the gear for a trip-hammer, that, by striking on the bottom of an old tin pan, could be heard at the house, though the little brook that turned the wheel was nearly half a mile distrtnt 19      -               : ' ; - ,'           ,    218      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: Bet it was the youngest boy, Walter,--the hero who, in his infantile days, had protested so successfully, at the time of the grand ball, against being exchanged by this same Joe,- that was now his greatest friend. He took to him with: a strange attachment; and every night, when in his night- gown his father took him in his arms to rock him to sleep, he would invariably ask for "Old Joe."' He knew him by no other name; and when he came and knelt down at his, mother's knee to say his evening prayer, if asked whom he' wanted to pray for, it was always father, mother, brothers, sisters, and everybody else, and "Old Joe," This boy Wal- ter was very different from all the other Gomery children; and, as he bids fair to be the hero of this book (if his friend Joe does not overshadow him), I advise the reader thus early to observe his peculiar and strange traits of -character. He was not-vivacious and playful like the older children, but, even at this age, would ask questions so strangely diffi- cult, that he was looked upon as an oddity, if not a prodigy. He would never engage in any cruel sport at the expense of dumb animals; and the dog and cat, if hectored by the older boys, would run to him for protection: and it was not-, till overcome by force that he would allow them to play their tricks on these friends of his. Even the chickens would come about him, and fear nothing; though, at such-times, the approach of an lder brother would send them clucking from the yard.    - - He was soon, to know'his first great grief. The summer had passed, and autumn had come, and brought its leaves of gold and red, with the fruit burning among them. Old' Joe had been his constant friend during the whole of the depart- ed season, and. there had been scarcely a day When he had . not been at the Pivot; and he was equally ready at all times to help the older boys. through with their " stents" if there was a fishing excursion, or any other juvenile adventure in prospect, or to wander about the woods and fields with 'Walter, telling him stories, cdossing brooks with him on his back, or gathering choice alples and pears to send to some poor woman or sick child in the neighborhood, concerning whom Walter was ever inquiing.    ' One\ day, Old Joe did not appear at the Pivot. Why, they knew not; and though Walter was impatient and discontent- ed,: going'into the road every five minutes, and casting a *    A FAMTT Y HSTORY.    . .  219' (glance towards the town in the hope of seeing the welI- known form heaving up the, hill, yet, when the night came, he -went off to bed withot a murmur, 'though he got his mother to promise, that, if he came in the night, he should be waked up to see him. But, as he did not appear the next day, not only Walter, but Theron and Wirt, became :so anxious and importunate, that, towards night, the old squire said he would go down to the village and see what had' be- come of him. He did not get -back till late, and till long after the usual bed-time for them all::but this night they were disinclined to retire till they had seen or heard from their friend; and their mother acceded to their wish, until Theron and Wirt fell asleep in their chairs, when unreluc- tantly they: obeyed her orders to go to bed. But there were no signs of drowsiness in Walter: he sat bolt upright in his chair, his eyes wide open, listening intent- ly for any noise or sound of approaching footsteps. "He is a strange boy," said his- mother to herself, taking him in her lap.    I  "You like Joe, don't you," said she, "better than anybody else?"              ,  . . "No, mother,-not better than you' or papa," said he thoughtfully. "And I would like Theron and Wirt a great deal better if they would not plague poor Peleg Sliff so." Th'en, reflecting a while, he said, "Ain't I a good boy, mother? Do I verp make a, noise, or plague Towser or Puss, as Wirt does? Do I ever call Peleg names, and ask about his pa, arid make him cry, as Theron does? Don't I do all you tell me?" "Oh, you are a darling good boy!" said she, giving him a kiss, which he received very passively. Then, looking at his thoughtful, anxious face, she thought how different he was from all her other children, how thoughtful of others, and how affectionate and unselfish.. -Can an organization so sensitive endure this rough world, and grow up to manhood? :She now thought of the weird words of Goody Wales the morn- :ing after the great ball, and clasped her child convulsively to her heart. But no sooner did she unloose her embrae than he resumed his earnest look at -the fire, as if, in the bright coals, he was reading the pages of futurity. "Don't you want me to love Old Joe, mother?" said he. ^ "Yes, my child: Joe is very kind to you." -"Poor Old Joe!  He has no children and no twife to love him,--only me. Poor Old Joe!"   220       GOOERY OF MONTGOMERY: At Athis time the souniA of steps was heard, and the lawyer entered. Laying aside his hat and cane, and calling the boy to him, he said, "Well, my good boy, why are kyou not abed?  "I'ranted to hear about Old Joe." "Well, I have seen him this evening at the taverns and he is not very well. I hope he will be better before long,. and then he will come and see you." The eyes of the boy were suffused with -tears; but he only said he wanted to go to bed. He was accordingly gratified; and, after his mother returned from seeing him well covered and tucked in, she inquired more particularly for the sick man, and her husband said, that, from what he could learn, the romancer had not been quite well for a week or two preceding. Unfortunately, when he returned to the tavern two evenings before, he encountered some travellers of a social turn, who had stopped there for the night. Joe, as usual, must entertain them with stories, and with his favorite beverage, flip. He began by telling of his wonderful adventures in Unheard-of parts of the earth ; and, for every story he told, one of the travellers gave another, if possible more extravagant and absurd; The flip flowed freely; and, as Joe found that in story-telling he was getting the worst of it, he thought he would put his an- tagonist hors de combat by aid of the potent flip. But though the traveller swallowed it fearlessly, and called for more, he only grew more glib of tongue, and more prolific of marvellous tales; and at last Joe got so thick of utterance, that he could not go on, and was obliged to retire from the field, which he could only do by the aid of Diller and Phile- mon, who supported him to hirs room, which he had not left since. The combined effect of- the flip and of the discomfit: U re so prostrated him, that the next morning he was too sick to leave his bed; and Doctor Purkitt, being called in, said he hqd a severe and very dangerous fever. During that day, he had been allowed to see no one but the physician and Tench Wales, who acted as watcher and nurse, till Lawyer Gomery arrived, who, as the important man of the village, was allowed to transgress rules that alltothers must respect. The next morning, Walter was up before any of therest of the family, and, as soon as he was dressed; was for going off to see his fi-iend ,Joe. But, when his father came down, he told him he must wait, and that Ethan shouldgo to the   A FAMLY HSTORY.         221 village to get some wheat and corn ground at' the mill, and Should inquire and bring back word about Joe. Poor Walter tvas but illy satisfied with th arrangement, but, as usual, submitted without a murmur, and went quietly out to look after his ducks and chickens. But when the breakfast-hour came, and he took his little high chair at the table by his mother's side, he barely tasted the cup of sweet bread and milk that was set before him, aAd said he couldn't eat it. So he got down from his high chair, and went back to his ducks. It was almost noon before Ethan returned; and the news he brought was, that he wa'n't Ino better, and, if any thing, a little wuss."' He also brought from the village a box of fiuit which had been sent from a town far to the south of Montgomery by somne of the distant relations of Mrs. Gom- /    cery. It had been left at the Eagle late the night before, and Ethan brought it up to the Pivot on his return. It was a strong box, about a foot long by six inches in breadth and depth, and, when opened, appeared to be- filled with nicely packedz cotton; but, dn, removing the first. layer of this, the sight of some large blushing peaches, with the down yet on them, was revealed. Theron and Wirt were each given one of the finest, and ripest; which they quickly disposed of, and came back clamorous for more. Walter also had one given to him; but, instead of devouring it as the others had done, he carried it up to-his sleeping chamber, where he had a little box for keeping his juvenile riches. In this he care- fully laid his peach, and covered it with a piece of paper, so that Theron or Wirt should not discover il if they chanced to pry into his treasury. He then returned to the sitting- room, and all were promised another at supper-time; and, after that, each was to have one morning, noon, and evening, till they were all gone. The proposition was demurred to by all three of the 'boys, who insisted that their father and mother should come in, at least, 6n equal shares. This being conceded, the box was put away till evening. When the hour for distribution came round, Theron and Wirt always. had a contest for the largest one; and, after this was settled by lot, Theron was ever ready to sell out: to Wirt for some- thing less perishable than peaches, and the latter was disposed to gratify his palate at the expense of his pennies and" fo- pences.'"But, as they could seldom agree on the value of the perishables, the result generally was, that, after much hag- l9*    2222     GOTMERY OF MONTGOMERY: gling and many offers, they ended by each devouring his own, and calling the other mean and stingy. But Walter always went away by himself; and, as his brothers supposed it was to eat his peach alone, Wirt called him a pig, and Theron a sneak.  Every day, Walter inquired several times about his old friend Joe. But n'o cheering word .came to him. Every day the report was that he was '" no better;" and the squire  and his wife both knew that no better meant' worse. So one afternoon, when the two older boys were away in the woods gathering beech-nuts, and Walter was down looking at the trip-hammer that had got out of gear during the absence of Joe, it was resolved -that they would drive down to the village, and call and see the sick man. Mrs. Gomery took with her some strawherry-preserves, some raspberry-shrub, some sago, and other niceties, such as are usually given to sick a/nd convalescent people. Poor Joe was indeed very sick: but the honor and kindness which' the squire and his' wife had \ shown him by coming to visit him went right home to his heart,; and his face bright- ened up with a sense' of gratitude as the handsome Mrs. Gomery sat down by the side of his bed, and began th ques- tion him of his 'condition. The fever h d been running for several days with great violence, and gatie as yet no signs of abatement or turning. It was difficult 'or the poor, man to talk, though he inquired about the boys, and especially for Walter. When the good woman told how hardly he had taken his absence, and how he went about restless'and dis- c contented, inquiring for him many times each day, the inva- liid smiled, and, evidently affected, said, s' Then there is some- body that cares for Old Joe, after all. Do let him come and see me, will you?" "Yes, he may come," answered the lawyer; "but perhaps he had better wait a few days till you are stronger." "No," said- Joe. i"Let him come to-morrow. Perhaps- no, it can't be: my work is not done. Oh, well! no matter. Let him come' to-morrow." He could say no more, and the visitors withdrew. On their way, Mrs. Gomery asked her husband what Joe meant when he said his work was not done. -( I can't imagine. There is some mystery about that mat quite incomprehensible tdo me, If he lives, I mayfind it -out; but 1 fear it .vill die with him. His hours are few."' * '  -   *' r  '  '   . /  . .   A FAMLY HSTORY.        223 As they approached their home, they met Walter a quarter of a mile from the house, coming to meet them. Though all the boys had been warned not to go so far. from home without leave, yet the parents, knowing what had induced him to go astray at this time, did not have it in their hearts to say a word to him, but stopped for him to get into the chaise; when his mother took him in her lap, and pressed him in her arms more fondly than ever before. She had been proud of her other children; but this one developed such -pre- mature affection, such filial love, and precocious moral quali- ties, that her heart yearned towards him with a depth -of feeling that she had never before experienced. She looked into his calm thoughtful eyes until her ow0n were suffused and well-nigh .overflowed. Then with an effort she controlled herself, and told him that that they had seen Joe, and that to-morrow afternoon they were going to see? him again; and he might, if he was a good boy, go with them. "Me a good boy, mother?" said he; c" ain't Lalways I good boy?"' and, at the reflection her words implied, he burst into tears .. But, when evening came, he appeared mrore sprightly and cheerful than he had been for days. -He prattled of the good times he expected to have when Old Joe got well; of the promised visit to Obededom Homer, who had but a little ' before met with a serious accident, having had his ankle-bone shivered very badly, so that it; could not - be got, into place again by the do tors; in consequence of which he suffered constant'and excessive pain. Then he would carry Obed-  edom  some of the best apples in the orchard and hismnew bow-gun- that Joe had made for him, and was as enthusias- tic as was "my Uncle Toby" when enumerating all he pro- posed to do for poor Lefevre.- And, besides all this, he was going with Joe, to take -some good warm clothes, some tarts and "goodies " that his mother had promised him, to the poor wicked woman that lived all alone in a little house, and whom nobody but his mother ever went to see, because all -the folks said she was so wicked. Since her little boy Peleg died, that never had any father, she had lived all alone, and was very poor; for nobody in the village would give her any thing to do, because of her great sin, except Mrs. Gormery. She, however, could defy the public sentiment and the anath- emas of the persons who professed to be following Him wltho   224 ; GOMERY OF MQNTGOMERY: had said, "Neither do I condemn thee: .go, and sin no more." -This poor woman wore not-the visible scaliet letter; but it was nathIess ever burning into her breast. She passed unrecognized through the village; or, if noticed at all, it was by heartless boys, who jeered her as she passed. Caleb . Thornton, it is true, bought her finely knit stockings and mittens, and never cheapened them; and Mrs. Gomery gave her the wool for their manufacture, besides which she sent her many little presents of fresh meat, of' fruits and vegeta- bles. .But these people, as we have seen, were regarded by Parson Millson and his flock as not only spiritually blind, but as worse than the infidel.. The lonely and friendless con- dition, of this outcast- had often excited the sympathy and inquiry of W'alter; and it' had been at his suggestion that many a delicacy had been sent to her-from the Pivot. This evening, as the prospect of Joe's return loemed 'up before him, his thoughts were only of doing good to the unhappy and afflicted. His mother listened to his enthusiastic plans4,  and could hardly keep back the tears as-she thought of the disappointment that, in all probability, awaited him. She could not, however, bring herself to communicate her fears. that Joe had played his last trick and told his last story. But the words of Goody Wales, the night after the great ball, came to her recollection; and she withdrew to her own room to indulge in a gush of tears. "Ah, Walter, Walter! - what an oddity you were, to be sure I and what a task-is upon me to bring you through the world! Will you be hanged or translated? Your destiny points to one of these extremes. You have come upon me With such qualities as the great masters never ascribed to their characters, except purposely, and with malice prepeise, to kill them off prematurely; and how can you .expect to. fare in such bungling hands? But courage: yours is not to be the fate of little Nell, nor of Eva, nor of the traditional 'good little boy that died." ' The next day, after dinner, the old horse and chaise were brought to the door; and Walter, in his Sunday's best, was eager to set out. But, just as they were ready to start, he ran up stairs to his own room, and brought-down a small box under his arm. "What is that?" said his mother, taking it fram him. The boy was half reluctant to give it up; but his mother nevertheless took and opeed it -and -found on. the ',      .,l,   A FAMTTY HSTORY.        225 top somne loose cotton, beneath which were all the peaches that had been given him (save two that he had sent to Obed. edom Homer), and which they had all supposed had been eaten at the time. But, alas! the peaches were all rotten. "{My dear boy," said his mother, placing the box on the table, "you are a good boy, and I will tell Joe how you .remem- bered him; but your peaches are all spoiled." Walter burst 'into tears at this; and the old squire, who found his eyes getting moist, went out, and stood beside the carriage. "Boys," 'said the mother to Theron and Wirtimir, "you 'called Walter a pig and a sneak; yet, while you ate up all your peaches, he saved his for his poor sick friend. Who is the pig, I would like to know, now?"The boys stole away abashed to the task that their father had setthem at gathering apples; but they soon forgot, their shame and self-condem- nation in the amusement they found in throwing- the apples at each other. On the way to the village, Mrs. Gomery held her boy in her lap. She could see that he was sorely troubled in spirit; and, for fear that he should;break forth in tears, she made no allusion to Joe. Thinking, however, to divert- his attention, she asked him what he had been doing during the morning. 4"I was at the spring, watching the angels, I have watched 'em a great many times to see the tears run down their faces; but I never saw them till yesterday." , "Who has told you any thing about the ' Weeping An- gels'?" "Old Joe: he says that they often weep at night at the hour the poor Gault Family was killed; and, when any danger is nigh, they weep all the time. Last night the water was trickling down and dropping into the spring, and this morm-- ing too." "Have you ever noticed, Freeborn, any thing in regard to this superstition of the ' Weeping Angels?" "I have noticed that the water trickles down from above at some seasons of the year, and not at others, and from those points of the rock in the arch overhead, that, in the twi- light, seem to be the heads of human figures. But, with a strong light, no fancy could imagine such a resemblance. The Indiang, it is said, gave them the name of' Weeping An- gels;' and it is probably'one of their superstitions, that these tears portend catastrophe."   26      GONE RY OF MONTGOMERY  When'the lawyer, with his wife and son, reached the tav- ern, they found there a number of people, who had collected from a sense of mingled cu'riosity and smpathy. A doctor of considerable local eminence, named Keezar, from Tivernet, had been called in to add his mite to the vast quantity stored in the head Of Doctor Purlitt. Squire Gomery had given orders the day before to have him sent for, as' in his opin- ion, to use his own figure, - Purkitt knew as much of medicine as a hen knew of geometry. The two were in con- sultation over the sick man at the time of the lawyer's arri- val; but directly they iame down from the sick man's cham- ber, and the squire asked the Tivernet doctor for a few words in private with him. Little Diller, whose ears were ever open, showed them into his wife's parlor, Mrs. Gomery accompanying them; while Walter was left in the entry, exposed to have his already overwrought sympathies still more excited by the undertone expressions of those around' him! Doctor Purkitt thought it very strange that he was not invited to this conference on the case; and, on being asked how the patient was, said "he had been doing very well'; and, if he had been left alone, he would have had him out in a few days. But he could not answer for what these new-fangleid doctors might do." ,  When the door of the parlor had been closed, the physician was asked to state frankly and fully what was the actual con- dition of the patient. To this, Doctor Keezar replied that -the fever had run its course, and at the same time it had run the patient so low, that it was doubtful if he- had life enough left in him to rally. "The disease," he continued, 'is ex- hausted. He is alive, it is true; and that is all. There is no forqeq nor strength nor vitality left. If by any means a re- action could be got up, he would doubtless recover; and it is possible he may float over the crisis, and, without any extra- neous aid, survive. It is barely possible, and that is all. But, without some turn, the little life left cannot long continue. He lies just hovering on the brink of two worlds; and the scale is so nicely balanced, that the least thing will turn it either way. If. by any expedient his nerves could be ex- cited, or his mind impressed by some story, pleasurable rem- iniscence, or emotion, he would recover. But I have ex- hausted my ingenuity, and he lies still dormant; and ere long, unless there if a reflux, the little life left must ebb away."   A FAMLY HSTORY.        227 "Let us go up and see him, Freeborn," said Mrs. Gomery. "Perhaps we can say something to revive him or make him laugh. "Do it, and'I then shall have strong hopes of him," said the doctor. They all left -the parlor and went-up stairs, and were met at the door of Joe's room by his ever-faithful friend, Tench Wales. Mrs. Gomery with an affected lightness approached his bedside, and said, "Well, how are you to-day? Better, I hope." The only answer to this was a slight raising of the eyelids., The lawyer now spoke up, and said, "Joe, they say you are likely to kick the bucket, and I have come up to make out your will for you. Of course, you will want to provide for your namesakes, who were to have cows and money, and a great many other things, when you got to- be a lord; and also for those of your sister Nancy, who died in the poor- house." This sally of the lawyer, recalling to his mind the inci- dents of the great ball, caused the eyelids again to move; and even the faint glimpse of a smile could be seen. But it was only for a moment. The lawyer looked at Dr. Keezar, who shook his head, as much as to say," Too late." Just then, Walter, who had remained in the back-ground, crept- up quietly to the bedside, and, in a voice that was not to be mistaken by Joe even at this low tide of life, said, "'Old Joe, Old Joe, little Walter has come to see you." The eyes now opened wide; a decided smile lit up the sick man's features; he drew a longer and a stronger breath; the ebbing tide was turned, and the way of Joe Pumpagin set once more towards life and the world. * ,   228      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: , CHAPTER      XV111. -"The pang, the curse, with which they died, Had never passed away .)-COLERIDGE. "The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge." -FzAK :tj. THOurGH the story-teller began to improve firom the time of the event described in the last chapter, yet he was so very low, that the change was for some time almost imperceptible, and it was several weeks before he was able to get up to the Pivot. There was not at first life or strength enough left in him to start upon with any degree of momentum. But he improved in a sort of geometrical ratio, -the little that he gained one! day enabling :him to gain twice as much the next,-- until he was able to sit up; 'and then his improve- ment was very rapid. And, a few days after that, Lawyer Gomery came, one fine November morning to the tavern with his old-fashioned "' one-horse shay," and took him out for a drive in the brisk, invigorating air. A few days after this, the lawyer came again; and this time he was accompanied by' Walter, when the convalescent was taken to the Pivot, where, though still pale and weak, he soon felt himself to be a well man. Walter every day watched the spring. The next day after his visit, he told his mother that the angels did not drop -their tears half so fast as on the day before; and, a few days after that, he came running in with great joy, and said they had ceased entirely. One day the squire sent Walter to request Joe to come to his private room. The summons was obeyed ; and Walter was told to go and join his brothers, and not to return for an hour. The lawyer begged Joe to be seated, saying he de- ,sired to have a long talk with him. The perplexed victim obeyed, looking confused, guilty, and comical. He knew nough of Freeborn GQmery to know that he was not to be    .  ?                 1 A FAMTTLY HSTORY.        229 cajoled or trifled with, and that, though he could brave with indifference and contempt a whole crowd of bar-room doubt- ! ers of, his stories, he could not impose upon the stern, search- ing, practised lawyer; and he felt that the words would stick in his throat if he attempted deception under the clear, hon- est eye of Gomery of Montgomery. "Mr. Pumpagin," said the lawyer, "you have been a great traveller, and have seen much of the world, and, in the course of your vagabond life, have picked up a great deal of information; and, with your rich imagination and total dis- : regard of truth, you make yourself vastly entertaining to the idle crowds that you collect around you." "Yes, sir,l; answered Joe; "but my stories don't do any harm." "You have had a strange, eventful life; and that which you have always led about here has been one of consummate acting,- in other words, false and affected. You have feigned an ignorance and carelessness that were not yours. You have pretended to a life without purpose, when you have been actuated by deep design; and you have dis- guised your real character so well, that, save Mrs. Gomery and myself and Tench Wales, no i one suspects that you are ] any thing else than what you pretend to be. With your boon companions you purposely use language coarse, ungramnmati- cal, and low; but, when you talk to my children, you are always severely correct, and reprimand them for errors of expression that few people would detect. Hence I have heard it said, that, when you are well charged with flip, you use better language than when strictly sober. To me this is proof that your bad English is affected, and 'that you use-it as a blind for some purpose, that, as yet, I do not understand. Now, I beg of you, do not think me distrustful or suspicious; but, as I see that you are assuming a character not your own, it is my duty to my children, before you are allowed to asso- ciate with or influence them further, to know what is the drift, the object, of all this acting, --this assumption of an unreal character. Your familiar and winning ways with chil- dren show a natural tact and refinement that ill comports with , the boisterous mirth you display among the coarse natures that delight to gather around you and:, listen to your fantas- tic, absurd stories, and drink grog at your expense. I have th ought much about you of late, and have tried to imagine 20  4  , *      .   230       GOMERY OF IdMONTGOMERY: a reason why you should, for so long a time, assume a char- acter not your own. But I am still all in the dark; and now either all acquaintance and intimacy must be broken off, or I must hear from  your own lips something of your true history."5 Joe sat bolt upright in his chair during this harangue of the lawyer, at first looking quizzical and humorous, but after- wards surprised and serious. The lawyer looked steadily in his face for a reply; and he said, "Well, square, you give me credit for moie wit than anybody else. I was not aware I was such a dangerous character. I believe I have ex-      4 plained to other people satisfactorily my course of life, and how it happens that-I am situated as I am." "Evasion with me will not do. I know very well your condition when you left here, now nearly three years ago; arid I know, that though you had not a dollar then, yet two years afterwards you returned with a large sum of money.' "' I explained how I got it to the people at the tavern the night I got back, just so there' needn't be any mistake or wonder about it. Like Othello, I told ' The story of my life, From year to year; the battles, sieges, fortunes, That I have passed. I ran it through, even from my boyish days, Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances, Of moving accidents, by flood and field; Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach; Of being taken by the insolent foe, And sold to islavery; of my redemption-thence, And portance in my travel's history:   I Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven, It was my hint to speak, -such was the process; And of the cannibals that each other eat; The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders.'" "Your quotations from  Shakspeare are very well in your fancy sketches," said the squire; "but I ask you for truth without poetry or romance." "But I find it so easy to quote Shakspeare: he expresses my ideas so much better than I can myself." ( No matter for that: -tell me! the truth in your own Amer- ican vernacular."    A FAMLY HSTORY.        231 "Very well, square; just as you say. Down, Shakspeare, down! Hide your diminished head." "I heard," replied the lawyer, not heeding the equivocal compliment, " of your explanation about the shipwreck,- and breaking the colt in the deep snow, and all those strange events of which Deacon Spinney believed every word. But the truth is what I want; and you surely can have no good reason to withhold it. By refusing my request, you betray a lack of confidence in me, and put me to an unpleasant neces- sity. You know full well I can have no person of'so myste- rious a characte', and so doubtful antecedents, in my house, the intimate and confidant of my children." The lawyer said this so sternly, looking the horse-tamer alli the while full in the eye, that Joe saw it was useless to attempt to equivocate further; that he must either say noth- ing at all, or tell the simple truth,--a thing he had never been known to do within the memory of " the oldest inhabit- ant." "At what period of my checkered life would you have me begii?" "Commence from the time that you left here three years ago. That will do for the present." 4 "That I amn very willing to do, though some things before that I must reserve to another time; but soine day you shall know it all. At present, it would advantage neither of us were I to make a full revelation." "Narrate, then, the events of the last two years, and as much more as you choose to make known." Joe now drew his pipe and a plug of tobacco from his pocket, and then, taking out an old jack-knife, began cut- ting off small chips -of the Virginia twist, till he had got enough to load his pipe; and then, lighting it with a coal, he sat back, and was evidently collecting his thoughts, and recalling to mind the scenes he intended to describe. At length he said, "You remember the night of the great ball?" "Yes: I have not forgotten it." "Well, it occurred to me, after the babies had allt been properly mixed up and sent off in the arms of other babies' mothers, -- all except your Walter, and he wouldn't mix with common folks,--that it would be a good time for me to leave, and travel in foreign parts. Well, you must know-that during the last war I was a privateer, and was in at the cap- (.      .    232      GOMERB OF MONTGOMERY: ture of two British vesse s that were sent to New- York to be condemned. I have often told of these adventures, but' have so mixed them up with others, that people put little more faith in them than in my trips to the moon or the poles. After we had made these captures, one of which was a very valuable one, our ship was captured in turn,iand the crew were all sent to England, , There I was kept a prisoner ' till after peace was declared, when I was turned adrift in England ;/ And being, as you know, of an inquiring turn of mind, I thought it a good opportunity to see a bit of that little island. H therefore travelled about afoot and alone; and, though I hadn't a cent of money, I never wanted for any thing." ' How was that?" inquired the lawyer. "You did not help yourself, I hope, to what you needed.' "Far from it. I had wit, if I hadn't money. I knew something of human nature; and iwhen, in my travels, I came to a house that looked comfortable and snug and neat, and saw the children and women-folks about the door, I would go up and begin to talk with 'em. Of course, it didn't' take me long to get them all interested in my adventures. Then I would branch off to the last war with-America, and v would inquire if any of their friends were engaged in it; and, as it was generally the case, they knew of some one who had been, I was prepared with a great deal of information about him.! If killed, I had seen him fighting, bravely; and, if woundedI I had borne him from the field on my own shouI- ders; and, if he had escaped unhurt through all, I could tes- tify to his gallant conduct in battle on several occasions. If, again ;he had never returned, and they knew not what had become of him, I shrewdly suspected he was the same man, - for the name was the same, - that, after the war was over, , had staid in the country, and settled down, and married a Yankee girl for a wife, who wasa second cousin of mine, - my uncle having emigrated forty years before, - and as tidy and likely a girl as any in them parts. With such conversa- tions I would beguile the time till I saw the supper prepar ing, and then would mnanage to be in the middle of a very interesting story just as it was ready.. Then I would break short off, and say, 'Ah! 'I see your supper is ready, and the poor old soldier must be. on his way. My poor wife and children little think where I am; that after fighting long   I A FAMLY HSTORY.        233- and bravely for my country, and being shipwrecked, and cast away among the savages, I am on my way to my old home; ;and that at last, having escaped all the other dangers by sea and land, I am like to die of starvation in my own country; for I have not had a morsel to eat for the last twenty- four hours, and have no place to sleep' but under the broad sky.' This would usually be sufficient to excite the compas- sion of the little folks; and more than once have I known the little girls to come up stealthily, and give me bread and cheese and cakes, and such things as had been given to themselves to eat. When I have been in the middle of a story of great interest (for I don't need to invent stories to make them interesting, after all I have seen; for, begging your pardon, Othello's adventures were nothing to mine), telling of my dangers and escapes, I have had little girls, with tears in their eyes beg their mothers to give their sup- pers to me. Thus I seldom failed of getting enough to eat; and sometimes I would be offered a bed, and sometimes would be allowed to sleep on the sweet hay in' the barn or stack. In the morning, I would make bold to ask for a cut of meat, and slice of bread: and this, after the hospitalities of the night, was never refused; for, having gone so far, they would not do any thing niggardly at my departure. I have always found, that, if you can get a little bit of ari opening into a person's heart, you can soon, with tact and patience, walk in and take possession\. The first favors are then a sort of capital invested in charity; and as people neither wish to lose it, or acknowledge it was badly invested, they are loath to forfeit your good opinion afterwards, which was the con- sideration previously received.    , "I had wandered about for five or six weeks, and had seen a great deal of England. The way those great lords live there beats any thilg about here. Your house here at the Pivot is not so good as some of those great men have for their hogs and horses. They had such grand houses, such fine fences, and fields so closely hedged in, and all that, and their servants were so well dressed, and looked so fat and saucy, that I thought it would be a fine thing to have a  place among them as keeper or hostler or butler, or any thing that gave good living and little to do. You may be sure it did . not take me long to get inside of the best houses in England. Genius triumphs everywhere; and I flatter myself I have 20*    234      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY': my share of that available commodity. Hence I   had only to get into conversation with-one of t]ie servants, when I soon made myself so interesting, thit I was Pcheek by jowl with the- butler, steward, and 'all ]]ands, within the next twenty-four hours. In fact, of an evening, I often held a levee in the kitchen, where came all the servahts to hear my strange and amusing stories; and, as it happened that an under-keeper had been discharged, the butler and upper- keeper managed to get me taken in his; place. The butler loaned me seven pound ten shillings to get me a uniform, or livery; and I was soon set up in as good style as any lord in England. "In return for all my stories, the servants told me a great deal about the affairs of the family. The present lord was a man not far from sixty, though he looked older in the face. He was tall, spare, and erect; his hair white as snow, and his eye restless and uneasy, and ever turning away from whatever object might be before it. They said he was a very irritable and'unhappy man, and there were strange stories of some dreadful thing he had done when a young man. He had been an officer in the army during the Revolutionary War, and had fought against-our troops under Arnold and Stark, and lost his wife during one of his campaigns in Canada. He was, at that time, only a colonel in the army; but his elder brother, Lord Maccleton, died soon after his return from America, leaving an only son, who also died, during his 6 , minority: so that-he succeeded to'the Maccleton title and estates, and was now Lord Macclethn. His daughter by his first wife he carried home to England, where she was brought up with great care by her father's relatives; and, as she was heiress in her own right to an immense property, she made what was called a splendid marriage; that is, she married into one of the oldest and most aristocratic families in Eng- lafid, though it was said to have been recently distipnguished in a different manner from that which distinguished its an- cestors and founders, who had won their estates and honor by services in both field and cabinet. The descendants, however, were only eminent for their misfortunes. They had nothing left but their titles, having squandered every thing else; and so mortgaged the income of every thing they could not sell, that the only chance for the young lord to redeem himself was a rich marriage. The only daughter of   A FAMLY HSTORY.         235 Lord Maccleton had the one essential qualification; and though she had a strong aversion to the young Lord Beres- ford, who, at thirty, was a worn-out roue, yet, at the imperi- ous mandate of her father, she resigned herself to the grovel- ling rake. As there was no loye on either side, the mar- riage was mutually unhappy. "By judiciously husbanding the income of his daughter \during her minority, Lord Maccleton, at the time of coming into the old family estates and titles, was enabled to clear off heavy encumbrances, to make many and extensive improve- ments, and to maintain a style and retinue worthy of the former-grandeur of the family. And now, being a peer of the realm, he -was; though somewhat I advanced in years, re- garded as a most desirable son-in-law by ambitious mothers and managing dowagers. The fairest belle of seventeen in the kingdom might think herself fortunate in such a match. His hospitality was profuse; and titled dames with marriage- able daughters were not backward in accepting his invita- tions to Maccleton Hall- His manner was not agreeable, as he was morose and silent until his temper was mellowed by wine; and then he was very uncertain, breaking out now. in fierce passion, and then indulging in terms of maudlin tein- derness. "This part of my story, you must know, squire, happened before my last visit here, and does not come within the last three years; but it is necessary to relate it, in order that you may understand what is to come by and by." "Well, proceed." "Lord Maccleton was not -at all displeased at the hints thrown out by his guests, that his establishment was not com- plete without a mistress as well as a master; and in the course of time he proposed to the third daughter of Lord Totherly, who, though less than one-third 'as old as himself, was never-; theless, under the influence of that judicious instruction that is so -cultivated among the infallible classes in England, already prepared to confess her love. The marriage was speedily arranged, and as beautiful a young woman as ever trod the soil of England was transferred by all the forms of the Established Church to the bed of a man who was haunted through the world by the ghost of his former crimes. It was a great wedding, and we folks in the kitchen had a copy of the paper that gave a full account of it, and which added that   . 236     GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: ,   .       ?  , the happy couple set off for the Continent to be present at certain fletes in Paris and Vienna, and afterwards were to re- turn to Maccleton -Hall, that was to be opened with more than, its former splendor.   : g ^"The marriage brought nothing but fashion and misery to the young wife. 't er husband's way of turning his eyes, now this way and now that, as if he saw in all directions something that it pained him to look upon, had not particular- ly struck her attention before marriage. Indeed, she had seen but, little of him before that event, as the arrangement had been made by her parents, and she had dutifully consented to it. She only knew that she cared nothing for him; but she-had not regarded that as an objection to -her marrying him, as she had grown up, under the influence of privileged exclusiveness, to think that, so that she got a title and an es- tate, it was of small account what she got for an encumbrance in the way of a husband. But, when compelled to be in the society of this man, she could not avoid noticing his pecu- liarity. He could not gaze on an illumination in -Paris, nor contemplate the wildest and grandest scenery of the Alps, but some horrid figure would seem to rise before him, and compel him to turn his head away, and in an instant after to see again the same phantom.. So it was in looking at the finest paintings of Rubens, of Raphael, and Michael Angelo, in the Louvre; and so in the quiet and seclusion of his own room. There was evidently a dreadful apparition always present to his sight; and the manner and habit of the- man in trying to avoid it soon caused; his young, timid, and inexperienced wife to regard him with aversion and terror. But, worse than that, his wife found that every night, from the hour of eleven until four, he shut himself in his own private room, and would see no one. She asked an explanation of this, but he would give none; and, on coming to the hall, she learned that this had always been his practice, and the ser- vants said that at such time- he never slept. This informa- tion added greatly to her fear of her lord'; and her aversion became so strong, that his approach inspired her with terror and disgust. His daughter, the, Lady Catherine, whom he had brought back from America after the death of her moth- er, had been already married off to Lord Beresford; and her husband was leading such a life of dissipation as promised soo0n to leave her a widow, - a prospect at which no one who knew him could suppose she felt any great anxiety. ...*       -  '    A FAMLY HSTORY.        237 ' "Men in the ordinary walks of life, who have not grown up in the belief that they are of a higher order than the gen- el'ality of mankind, and consequently entitled to peculiar and special immunities, would have supposed that a person in Lord Maccleton's condition and mental distress would have sought by good deeds, and a virtuous and 'repentant life, to have conciliated the avenging Nemesis that ever confronted him. But I observed that people in the class to which he belonged had little idea of responsibility to the general world, or of reciprocal obligations between them and their fellow- men. They have au undoubting faith in their own infallibili- ty, that any thing that differs from the standard set up by themselves, .whether of morals, of manners, of religion, or politics, must be wrong; that whatever they do must be, right; and that the complete duty of man consists in enrich- ing and strengthening the privileged'classes, and in circum- scribing and restricting the power and influence of the work- ing multitude. If they concede any thing to the latter, it is because they must, and not because it is right; and, they think it strange that Heaven permits those who hold divine privileges to be fettered and restrained by those that the same Heaven has ordained to be their subjects and depend- ants. "Lord Maccleton was one of this class. He didn't realize that he had any duties except to those of his own rank. His religion was found in the peerage, and the book of her- aldry was the evidence of the divine heritage; and, though an old man now, all his thoughts in respect to the future were upon the succession to the estates and title of MVaccle- ton. In the course of the first three years of his married life, his wife had borne him a son and a daughter; and his daughter, Lady Beresford, had also given birth to a son: so that every thing seemed to favor his ambitious designs. But about a year after the birth of the second child, the daugh- ter, it was said that his wife received a letter from some un-:  - known source, that caused her to loathe the very sight of her husband. He had long been an object of aversion to her; but, after this ill-omened letter fell into her hands, he became utterly unbearable. But another .great grief awaited this unhappy   woman.  Both her children were observed to have their father's habit of averting their eyes from some seemaingly disagreeable object, - not always, and in all places,     Y 288      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: like him; but if, alone and quiet, they looked for any consid- erable time in one direction, there seemed to rise up some disagreeable object' that made a painful impression, and caused them to turn their heads away to avoid the hideous sight. It has clear to the mother that her children had in- herited the / peCuliarity of their father; 'and one day, olbserv- ing the elder one, the son, gazing on a distressful sight that was to herself invisible,and begin soliloquizing, she listened, and overheard such, expressions as these: 'What a pretty face!! Who could be so wicked as to cut her so? Ah, the blood! how it runs! ' and then .he turned away his eyes, and for a time was apparently as blithesome and happy as -any child of his, years. But, if for any cause his eyes were -cast in any direction for several minutes, the appa- rition was sure to rise, and compel him to turn away to avoid the sight.. The daughter too, young as she was, showed that -she had a similar infirmity; for she did not long hold' her gaze in any one direction, in the manner of most children. Such an accumulation of sorrows drove the poor woman into a delirious fever, in which she called her husband a fiend and an assassin, and said he might well turn his eyes away from the woman he had violated and murdered; for it was not a pretty sight, - a woman with her throat cut. Then she would screech and'scream, and tell her attendants to take him away, or he would murder her too. But the poor woman did not live long; and the servants who had heard these strange imprecations and upbraidings were immediately sent to distant parts, though not before they had told, in the strictest confidence, of the scenes in the sick lady's death-chamber. "These things had all happened before I was there; but I learned them all from the servants below stairs. The days of mourning for the deceased wife were past when I was first engaged in service, and the hall had assumed its former appearance of cheerfulness and luxury. There was much company at the house, of the most exclusive and aristocratic sort; and it was thought that my lord would take another wife. But his object had been obtained byhis second mar- riage, as it had brought-him two children, who, notwithstand- ing the infirmity they had inherited from him, were, never- theless, strong and healthy. A male heir to the Maccleton bstates, in the direct line, was what he had desired; and,   A FiAM ILY',-HSTORY.      239 as he had secured that, his dead wife was soon forgotten, andhe -had no reason for taking another. "Among the visitors at the hall were some rich relatives of, Lord Maccleton, from London.  Of the number -was the family of a great banker, who, it was said, had made his money himself which the head butler and steward said was. not considered respectable, and that we w ere not to show him so much respect as Lord Beresford, who had spent-all he had inherited, and married the governor's daughter only for her money. And, yet they said the banker was- a great man too: for the king used to ask his advice in great affairs, and had made a baronet of him; so that he was, called Sir Henderson Strongham.   He had married the sister of Lord Maccleton against the wishes of her friends, and'the affair made a great scandal at the time; and her family cast her off, and would not speak to her, till her husband got to be very rich and a baroqet, and could buy out all the Maccle- tons, and not feel it. They then offered to forgive the erring daughter, and she and her husband were very glad to be forgiven; -for there is no act of self-abasement so low, but that a thorough Englishman will submit to it, if, by so doing, he'can secure the notice of the old aristocracy, and be allowed an inferior position within their charmed circle. I speak, I am aware, with severity and prejudice; but that which I have seen I know; and, if I am prejudiced against: Al- bion, surely I have had more reason to be so, humble and obscure as I am, than any man that ever lived, - not except- ing the great Bonaparte.        . "I staid in this place nearly a -year; but at last I got tired of it. The fact is, I never made my bow, and, hat in hand,l said ' Your lordship,' but what I felt ashamed of myself. The work I had to do was light, but the pay was lighter. The fare was good; and the butler, who took a great fincy-to me, used to give me many a glass of wine that would make my eyes sparkle. . He had a buxom daughter, and I think he wished me to marry her; but she gave rne such evidences of liking me, that thought it not worth while to pay any fee for license or rlergyman. In fact, the morals below stairs were very loose; and such, I was told, was the case with the servanfts of all the nobility. The young lords, and even the old ones too, play the- very devil with the daughters of their domestics; and the latter have such a reverence -for- ti- tles and noble blood, that they think it no disgrace.   240 ,     GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY : "So, at the end of a quarter, after I had got my pay (it was a mighty small sum, believe me), I concluded to give up my situation, and resume my travels. But as I had played' off a great many jokes during my stay, and had always stoutly maintained thesuperiority of my own country to any other, my fellow-s rvants had retorted on me by calling me a Yankee; which, according to their ideas, was something very contemptible. So I determined I would not leave with- out playing a joke worth remembering, and showing them a bit of my Yankee character and ingenuity. As Lord Mac- cleton was to give a great dinner to some of his famous friends, I thought that would be a good opportunity to get even with them all for the insolence and disrespect they had shown to a sovereign of this great Republic. To accomplish my object, I must get into the dining-hall, and serve at table; which was not one of my allotted duties. How to do this was the first ,question; and I managed it by asking one of the servants who served in that capacity, and who happened to be near my size and figure, to drink a glass of beer with me a short time before the hour for dinner. In half an hour he was sick and scared, and knew not what ailed lhim; but I had a suspicion that a sprinkling of ipecac had been put in his beer, and that it had caused his sudden illness. 'The feast was set, the guests were met;' and one of the head waiters was -unable to serve, and a substitute must be found among the other servants. Of course, I (knew they would select me for that duty, as I was- about his size, and could wear his livery. So he was put to bed; and his fine suit was assigned to me for the evening. It was a great dinner. I was deputed to stand behind two veterans, one a bishop and the other'a peer, but-both of them with broad shoulders, capa- cious stomachs, and bellies protuberant. The soup was excel- lent, as I judged bythe way they devoured it; and so were the :fish, the roast, the game, and every thing. The wines were so superb, that their excellence formed the principal subject of conversation during the dinner; and the quantity that my two governors absorbed would have floated a birch- bark canoe. They got happy and careless as the dinner pro- ceeded; and told stories and uttered jokes, at which they laughed consumedly. Waiting my chance, I tied their two pig-tails together, and escaped from the room to the yard op- posite the-dining-room, whereI lighted a train that set off half /     .. 'e    A ViAMTTY-- HSTORY. -     241 a dozen rockets that I had previously arranged for an-exllo- sion. , I was back at my post-to enjoy the success of my own joke -by the time the match had burned up so as to reach the train of -loose powder, that instantly set off the rockets with a whiz, a sputter, and a trail of light, at which every one at table juiped up as if they had thought the day of judgment was upon them. My two particular friends jumped up in great fright; and, as they did so, they turned their faces from each other to break from the table, when their pig- tails brought them up with a jerkiso sudden, that the short- est and drunkest fell backwards, and, catching hold of the table-cloth, drew his companion after him, together with all the dishes, bottles, glasses, and candles yet left at the feast. With the exception of a :branch- candlestick, contain- ing a dozen candles, at the side of the dining-hall, all the lights were extinguished; and, by a judicious movement, I contrived to upset that without being-observed: so that we were all in total darkness. Several others of the company, among whom was Lord Maccleton, had rushed to the assist- ance of my lords on the floor; but, when the last light was out, they 'all fell into a heap as confused and ridiculous as that made by Spinney, Dobble, and., others, at 'the great drunk.' During the,tumult, I made good my escape, and that night. left Macdleton Hall. Great efforts were made to catch me the next day; but I was not one to be caught: and, as soon as it was safe to travel, I put out for the sea- coast. At the nearest port, I succeeded in getting the position of second mate on a vessel bound to New-York. On arriving there, I found that my share of the prize-money for one of the vessels we had taken in the war was on -de- posit for me, and the other was still in litigation. The latter wias a finelarge vessel with a valuable cargo; and my share in her, if it were decided in favor of the captorsp would not be less than five thousand dollars. The other, however, was a small affair; and myportion was only four hundred dollars. "I staid in New York until I had spent about a hundred dollars; when I happened to hear a man in a hotel talking of a fine section of land away to the west of the Hudson River, and which was being settled up very fast. He said he owned; two townships, and was selling it at a rate that was sure to make the fortunes of all-purchasers.- -' Now,' says I to myself, 'Old Joe, "There is a tide in lhe 21                 ' "-*s*  x  '   242      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: affairs of men, that, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune."' You see, squire, I must quote Shakspeare sometimes, if I am telling the truth. I have got so used to it in making up my yarns, that, even-when relating literal facts, I can hardly avoid appealing to the great poet to corroborate my opinions and illustrate my subjects. 'Then,' says I to myself, ' if there is such a tide, perhaps it is now at the flood; and, if so, now is your time to follow onl to fortune. Why not at once quit this roving way of life, buy a farm, settle down, and take your ease?' So I made up to the proprietor; ancl inquired all about the country, and the way to get there. He showed me his maps and plans, and pointed out his two townships on them, all laid out in streets. He urged me to buy, saying he would sell me, for two hundred aollars, a hundred acres of as good land as the sun ever shone on; and urged me to buy at/once, as it would soon be all gone. He said he would make the terms easy; that I need not pay more than fifty dollars down; though, if I paid all cash, he would take off twenty-five per cent. I told him I would go and look at the country first; and if th6 land suited me, and the price was not too high, I would purchase. Finding he could not make me buy a pig in a poke, he kindly told me the way; and said, if I would wait up there a month or two, he should go up himself, and would sell to me then if I cared to trade. "So the next morning I took passage on board a sloop, and went a hundred miles, more or less, up the river. Then I struck off for the west; and after travelling for six days, as directed by my friend in New York, I reached the townships he had described to me. But, instead of the streets and churches and schoolhouses that I had expected to find, there were only some dozen or two scattering settlers on the two townships, Yet it was a fine tract of country. The soil was rich and deep, and the climate healthy; and the people I met were so kind, and so well pleased with their prospects, that I resolved that I would buy,-when the proprietor came, at least ahundred acres. In the mean while, I busied myself in looking for the best lots and sections from which to select. A stream of considerable size ran through the farther town- ship; and, following it up, I discovered a fall of water, that I thought at some time must be valuable, for I had seen what a waterfall might prove to be in the case of Montgom- ery Village. I -no sooner nmade this discovery than-I deter.   A- FAMLY HSTORY.        243; mined to take a lot that would embrace the waterfall. I said nothing to anybody, however; and, when the owner came, I asked him what he would take for such a lot: he said a hundred and thirty dollars. I told him I would- take it; and he-made out the deed, and I paid him the money. But what could, I do with a waterfall or'mill-privilege? I had no money to build mills ; and, if they- were built, they would be /of no use until the country around was settled. Still I had  faith the water-power would one day be valuable, and deter- ' mined to bide my time. In the mean- time, I must live: so I began to build a log-house on my land, which was four miles from any human habitation; and, after that was done, I set to to make a clearing. But it was slow work, and I soon got tired of it. I was never over-fond of hard, continu- ous work; and, as game was plenty, I depended mainly on my gun for support. I soon got sick of the kind of life I was leading, and wished myself back in Montgomery. The life was too solitary for me: my neighbors were too far off for me to visit them often, and I lad made up my mind to leave; when, coming in one day, I found an old Indian fitting on the floor of my house, in front of the fire. He was Old, hag- gard, and deqrepit: and one leg had been broken, and either never set., or set so badly, that it was deformed and crooked; so that that foot was nearly at right angles to the other. "'Halloo! ' says I: ' who is here? ' A ,friend,' said he gruffly. "You make mighty free with your friends, then.' "'Ay; and I have made free with my enemies. Which are you?  (' Oh! a friend, I replied, not at allyliking his sinister re- mark. , Prove it, then,' said he;' for Vengeance is hungry.' "'On whom would you twreak your vengeance?" said I, now somewhat nettled at his sullen insolence. 'If you come here to threaten me, well and good; for we will understand each other. But, if you want food, you can have the same as I eat myself.? "-I said this standing with my gun, so that I could raise- it on the instant if he made a hostile movement. The savage, seeing I doubted him, gave a scornful sneer, and, with an expression of mingled rage and, contempt, said, 'Fear not, you-pale coward! for-the sun of Wenge-anice is. almost set. ,            \ ;   244      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: 1 He has no strength to follow his enemies; and his friends-- where are they? The leaves have fallen and fallen till their bones no longer whiten -their pathway through the forest, and Vengeance now begs his bread of the white man.' "This speech, with the manner of the old savage, disarmed me of all apprehension. I was ashamed of my suspicions when I looked at the wretched object before me. He was withered, haggard, and wrinkled. He might, from his ap- pearance, have been eighty or a hundred and eighty. His scanty hair hung in plaits, like so many snales; his fingers were long and bony, and his eyes dimly savage. "' Old man,' said I,' stay with me as long as you like.' I then went and drew a bottle of rum from a corner, and, pour- ing a gill of it into a tin cup, gave it to him. He drank it off as so much water, and said nothing more for some minutes. While h'e sat musing, I went out and cut off some thick slices from the body of a deer that I had shot the day before, and which hung suspended from the branch of a tree close by; and then, returning to the house, I raked some coals from the fire, and placed the venison upon theln. The sav- age glared at it with the ferocity of a wolf. 'Eat, old man,' said I, 'as soon as you like.' With the word, though the meat was hardly warmed, he reached forth and caught it from- the coals, and devoured it as one famished. He ate all I had brought in, and then saying, 'Vengeance will rest now,' lay down on the floor, and was soon fast asleep. "' Well,' thought I, as I contemplated the haggard figuree, looking grim and horrible before me,' I have been wanting cdmpany for a long time, and-here it is. This must be what such fellows as Cook and Craig and Spinney call a special Providence; but I don't know as I feel much inclined to thank Providence for it. But it is a human critter, anyhow, and shall have protection.' So I went and began to hoe in ,a small patch where I had planted some corn and potatoes, leaving him asleep. Towards night, I saw the old man come out of the house, and look about. Espying me at a distance, he advanced towards me w'th extreme pain. His age and lameness made walking very difficult and slow; butat length he managed to get near me, and said,' So, Pug-nose,' (do you know, square, he called me Pug-nose?) -' so, Pug-nose, you were not afraid to give deer and rum to old Vengeance? Ah! well, it matters little: a few days, and'Sleeping Ven- '  l!.          - -   f    A FAMLY HSTORY.        245 geance will sleep, and wake only where his fathers dwell; but he will not forget Pug-nose. No : behind the merry eye of Pug-nose shall dwell *the spirit of Sleeping Vengeance. Did not the old witch say-that the light heart and the merry- eye should hew the wood and draw the water for Sleeping Vengeance when his bones were gathered to the earth?' "This talk of the old Indian seemed but incoherent jargon at the time; but, if the savage was mad, I found, long after, that there was method in his madness. But I only said to him then, ' Come, let us go to the house, and we will talk of these things another day; for I suppose you will stay with me for some time. I th,en went on towards the house, fol- lowed by him with such slow and painful haste as he could make. I now cooked some more of the venison, and, putting some, Indian corn-meal into a kettle of boiling water, soon had a pot of boiling hasty-pudding. When it was sufficient- ly cooked, - set it' down on the hearth before him; and, while c I was looking for a dish and spoon, he began to eat it with his fingers, as if insensible to heat. He also ate several large slices of the venison; and, when sated, crawled to the side of the room, lay down, and was-soon asleep. - "I need not tell you of the life I led with this miserable being for my companion. I could not bid him go, and I did not want: him to stay. But he improved somewhat on ac- quaintance; and my generous fare seemed to infuse new life into him, and he became very communicative and garrulous. He told me of many desperate and bloody adventures that he had taken part in; and that, because of his great cunning and undying hate of all who injured him, he was called Sleeping Vengeance. One evening, after I had given him a large drink of rum, he went on to tell about the massacre at Gault's Hill; for it seemed that he was there, and took a leading part in that dreadful tragedy. He told me how he aided Col. Cumberland to surprise the house; and how he stole and carried away the child, while the king's officer, having'first drawn forth and murdered the man of the house, entered, and worse than murdered his wife; and how he after- wards sent in some other Indians, who cut her throat and made a funeral pyre for her, while he and Cumberland looked through the window to see the work completed, And the dead woman cast such a look on Cumberland, that he: could - never- sleep afterwards, but was always seeing her lovely, 21       '    '246      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: angel eyes turned towards him; while the horrid gash in her throat, fi om which the blood ever trickled, was always present to his sight., The bloo dever tricgled, and the eyes ever looked as of some being not of earthh, but rather 6f some good spirit, better than Indian ever worshipped, full, beam- ing upon him. Then he told how that for many'days he bore the child of the murdered pair throughl the forest, and how the colonel tried to get it from him to kill it, and how he scarcely slept for weeks, till at last it was taken from him by a trick, at the same time that his leg was shivered by a musket-ball. Thus he lost the child; buat the same night he cut the throat of the only child of thecolonel, and so disposed it in deat as to resemble, as far as possible, the dead form of Gault's wife, as she cast her last look upon him. A few days after- wards, the colonel and Gault's child sailed for England "When he had gone thus far, I told him that his story of the ever-present apparition reminded me of a man I had known:;in England, and who by strange coincidence, bore the same name/as the autho, of tjhe Gault murder. But of ' course it was not he, as he was a great man, a very honora- ble man, a peer of the realm, and one of that class whose united opinion was considered-infallible i "'Ah, ha, ah!"'he drawled out. 'Tell me of him.' "I then related to him, as I have to you, the events of my life in England, and dwelt particularly upon the idiosyncra- sies of Lord Maccleton. When I spoke to him of the letter which his wife received, thiat caused her so to detest her husband, he exclaimeld, 'Ah, ha! I she got the letter, did she-? I thought she would. Vengeance required it.' "What! ' said I, 'did you follow him to England? or how could you send a letter? ' "'Vengeance forgets nothing,' answered hie. 'It was a long time before my shattered leg would allow me to. move; and, when I, did move, it was only for vengeance. I fol- lowed the army of the king., I made myself useful as a spy, and learned all about the colonel firom other officers in the -kings army. I heardit said he had left with his child for Eng- land; though I knew his own child was dead, and he must have Substitutgd Gault's for it. I learned, too, that, after he re-. tkurned to Englandi he had married the fairest flower?that :er bloomed on a soil base en6ough t0 produee:ovitea oil, d tire,-,o v e"   * ' ..

He then drew from a pocket in his worn and stained garment a pack. age, and said, 'I leave this with ybu: it will explain itself. When I have'been gone for one week, open and read it, and not before.' "I took the package from the old man, and lay down on my straw bed on one side of the room; while he rolled over to the other side, and was soon asleep. The next morningI got up early, and, taking my gun, went out to see if I could shoot a partridge or hare. My luck was bad; and I was gone full two hours, having in all that time shot only three par- tridges. When I returned, the old man was still lying in the same place. I approached, and called but to him, but he moved not; He was dead. . I went over that day to my nearest neighbor; Ben Barker, and told him that the old In- dian, of whom I had before told him, was dead; and he and his hired man went with me, and we buried him. What an amount of suffering he must have endured from that lame leg! It was a hideous thing to look at. lMy prize-money was now nearly exhausted; and :I had nothing left but mty land, that would be of little use to- me for several years. I was more lonely than ever after the In- dian had left, me for his long home. I could not bear to sit in my cabin through a long evening. Besides, I had learned from his lips, and the package he had left behind, that I had something more to do than to wait. So I determined to leave; and leave I did. And in four weeks- was back in Montgomery, without a; cent in my pocket. That was the time of my arrival here lthe last time before this. I came by way of New York, and then I found the lawsuit about the other prize-money Was not yet decided. So I got on .boar a schooner, and worked my passage to Boston; and ottnd m wayon: foott tohis ow:.   248      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY.,: "' After being here for several tmonths, I left, as you may recollect, rather suddenly. I had other business, you may well , suppose, besides looking for means to fulfil my promisees to 'my namesakes, and to those of my ' sister Nancy, who died in the poor-house.' I thought I would go first and look after my prize-money. It was still tied up in law. You lawyers, square, have a bad way of holding on to money when you once get it. I then made a trip to the West Indies as mate of a small vessel; and, having got a little money in that way, I went up to look at my farm again.- The settlers were gath- ering in fast, and I found I could sell my place for five times what it cost me. I said no: I would wait. But I had the only water-power within six miles, and people wanted a saw- mill and grist-mill put up: so I sold ten acres from my pur- chase to a man who was a mill-wright, and gave him a lease of water-power, for S grist and saw mill, for ten years; at the end of: which time I was to take his improvements at their value, or give an extension of the lease. He paid for this just what I had paid for the whole, 4-a hundred and fifty dollars. And so, well satisfied, I left again; and, when I got to New York, the prize-money was ready for me. It amount- ed. to five thousand two hundred and seventy-three dollars. I then thought it a good time to return apd visit my old friends in Montgomery, and fulfil my promises to my name- sakes; and, taking a thousand dollars in my pocket deaving the rest drawing interest), I came on here, and here I am.- This is all of my story that I can tell you now." "' But what of the Indian's package? What was in that.?? inquired the lawyer. "That you must leave with me for the present,:' said Joe. "If the proper time ever comes, you will know all about its singular contents, but not now. Think not I could have lived this life if I had not been nerved to it by some great wrong. It is true, for a Idng time I knew not the unseen in- fluence that held me tiedj But do not think that a great crime like that against the Gaults could go unavenged. Ask not why I was of all the world the person fated to be the in- strument of the immutable laws of justice. 'Tis enough, that the crime is yet unrepented; for the fruits of it are as yet possessed and enjoyed by him who committed it. But ' this I have learned: that he who seeks to profit by wrong or crime enters the lists against God Almighty; and in his o'n   A       A FAMLY HISTORY.        249 foils he must be confounded.

I have a work to do; for I am the appointed instru- ment to work out the confusion of the guilty. But, if I call    up the apparitions of their deeds to the wicked, I invoke only honest ghosts. I disturb not the innocent, nor the re- pentant guilty. I have my work to do as clearly as had Hamlet; and I go to do it,--not indeed with rapier or pistol, but to prick to duty the guilty conscience. My, story is n'ow told. Even to you I can relate no more till I have finished the work that is before me." He ceased; and both he and the lawyer sat for several minutes without uttering a word. At length the latter rose from his seat, and said, "I neither doubt nor believe your story. It may be true; but bytit you have'proved yourself the most consummate actor I ever saw. That there was something mysterious about you and your history, as I told yoti at first, I hlave for some time been well convinced; and that leads me to suppose that your story is:true. But, as you have ever deceived everybody bdfore how can I know that you are not practising still deeper, deception ,on me now? I admit you appear in all respects a different! character than ever before. Hitherto you have always made people be- lieve you were illiterate, careless, thriftless, and ignorant; iand here you have told off your story, if not in language of classic purity, at least in good methodical English." "You have heard," said Joe, "the story of Junins Brutus, who was permitted to live only because folks thought him a fool. So I, by passing for an ignorant, illiterate, and purposeless adventurer, am indulged and tolerated where one thought, wiser would be distrusted. If I always, sign my name with' aln X, leaving somebody else to fill up the other part of it, people will never think of me as a suspicious or dangerous character; and. if I tell ridiculous, amusing, and absurd sto- ries of my adventures, they will despair of ever learning any thing of my real history. Hamlet, you remember, feigned insanity; but there was much method in his madness: and, if I   act the part of a. joker and buffoon, it is with o no Chess fell  purpose than that which possessed the Prince of Denmark."   250      GOMERY OF .MONTGOMERY' : "But it seems to me -you might -feel confidence enough in me to tell me your whole story." " Were I to do that, it would cause thy knotted and com- bined locks to part, and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porcupine.' It is not within the scope of my fell mission -revenge I do not call it--that any one should know- of my existence in ,my real character. I move, ah instrument of divine justice; and 'tis mine to keep alive the fires-of rem6rse in the unrepentant, guilty con- science. -I would willingly tell you all but for fear that, through unforeseen casualty, it mighI become known to others."- , You pay a poor compliment to my fidelity and discretion." "Squire Gomery, do you promise me that,- under any pos- sible circumstances or contingency, you will never reveal a word of what I now tell you?"  "Of course, I should never mention any thing told me in confidence. , Nevertheless, I pledge myself, in terms as Strong as you can make them, never to intimate by word or deed, by hint or sign, that I know any thing more of you or your history than is known to others of your acquaintances.1' ' Not if beggary and ruin stood before you, and could only be averted by disclosure?" "Not to save myself from the inquisition," said Gomery, smiling at the earneststns of Joe. 'Know then," said Joe, "that I am, the son of David Gault; that my father and my mother were murdered by Col. Cumberland, my sister carried into captivity, and after- wards substituted for his child that had been murdered by Sleeping Vengeance! The package left me by that hideous  savage contained a fearful legacy. It was along and closely written narrative of the Gault's-Hill massacre, much more; full and minute than he had told it verbally. How he had i propured it to be written, I know not; but there it was. I had been struck, when he was telling his story to me, by the resemblance to Lord Maccleton which his description bore to the author of that horrid deed. But yet it did not impress -me that they could b'e one and the saSne individual. At that "\ time, you must know, I knew nothing of my own family but that my father and mother had been murdered by the In- dians when I was but &a lad of five years of age. I had led a vagrant life, and had no earnestness of purpose or definite  *   n   A FAMMfY HSTORY.       - 251 object before me. I had never thought of returning to my birthplace again; and when he told me his story, though A greatly moved by his vivid description of the manner of my parents' death, I could not even then suppose that the author of it was the great Lord Maccleton. But the Indian's legacy     made known every things It gave a minute account of the murder; the journey to Quebec; the rescue of my sister from the savage; her substitution for Cumberland's murdered child ; the imposition practised by him on his friends and family in Engla-nd; his succeeding to the family estates and titles, and becoming Lord Maccleton; and the narrative con- eluded with a statement that it was intended to be read only by the son of the murdered Gaults, to whom the task of ven- geance was intrusted. I You may imagine, squire, that this revelation wrought a change in my whole nature.- It was days before I could Wcom- prehend it all. I was at first in a sort of stupor; but gradu- ally I awoke to a rigid purpose, and my life ever since has been impelled to one object. I shall soon set forth upon my mission; for it ,s not revenge. I am compelled by the nm- pulses of compelling Nature to be the Nemesis of one whose very life is a torment. ' ; i  "What do you propose to do?

When he is dead I will-return, and, pass the residue of my life here, and be buried on Gault's Hill, under the shadow of the' Gault Tree; and then the angels will weep no more. He ceased, and both sat silent for several minutes; at the end of which time the door' was gently opened, and Walter looked timidly in to see if he might venture farther. "Come in, my boy," said the lawyer; and Joe's narrative was con- , eluded.   252 .     ' GOMiERY OF XONTGOIMERY: CHAPTER XIx. '"She, as her carol sadder grew,   i From brow and bosom slowly down Through rosy taper fingers drew Her streaming curls of deepest brown To left and right, and made appear, Still lighted in la secret shrine, Her melancholy eyes divine,- The home of woe without a tear." - TENNYSON. FROM what we have seen of Joe Pumpiagin, and now know of his' antecedents, it is not to be supposed that he could long remain contented in the quiet town of Montgomery, notwithstaxnding that he was equally at home at the Pivot and at Diller's Tavern. Though he delighted to be the hero ,of the ("flippers," as his associates who'drank flip at his ex- pense were now called, and was ever welcome at the Pivot, and had formed so strong an attachment for young Walter that he was reluctant to leave him, yet it was not for him to- remain long inactive anywhere, as he was impressed with ,l the idea that there was some great and mysterious work for him to do. So, when the winter was over, and the days-  were lengthening as they went through the opening spring -until the middle of May was past, his resolution was sudden- ly taken; and, at a meeting of the "flippers," he invited, them all to .be there the next night, when he would show them a trick. Then, in the presence of several of his faith--* full supporters, he told Diller to be prepared for a big spree the next night. But the company had no sooner left, than,- as on a memorable occasion years before, he took his staff in his hand, and giving an outlandish gold-piece to Philemon, ' telling him to keep it till his return, and also to put his best trunk on, board the stage which was to pass by early the next . morning, he walked away, without so much as saying good- by, or even notifying his friends at the Pivot of his intended departure  * \    A FMLY HSTORY.        253 At the Pivot, much surprise was felt by the whole family when they learned that Joe had' left so abruptly., Walter was sorely grieved at first: but his mother consoled him by saying that his departure had been so sudden and unexpect- ed, that his return would probably be as sudden,and perhaps very soon; for "Old Joe was always up th pranks and- sur- I   prises. ' Consoled by this hope, the boy soon recovered his usual quiet cheerfulness; and the season glided by, allthings at the Pivot moving on in their accustomed channel. As the autumn came on, Freebomrn Gomery and his wife thought it time to decide definitely what should be the futuye calling, or rather education, of their youngest child. It had before this been decided that Theron and Wirtimir should be men of business, and learn the art of merchandising to profit; and it was the hope of Mrs. Gomery, and of the less ambitious squire, that Walter would take to books, and be- come a man of letters, and perhaps a great statesman. He was very different fromlthe other children; not so robust of constitution, nor so sprightly, mischievous, or, vivacious. He was not of other children of his years in their plays and- games. In quickness of parts, and capacity to learn, he was not behind either of his brothers; nor was he much their. superior. Yet he was a better scholar at the same age than they had been'; for he was more obedient, and did as he was bid either by teachers or parents. :If told to study, he' studied, if not from a desire to learn, then from a sense -of duty; and he never repined at an unreasonable lesson, but I- set himself to it as a thing to be accomplished if possible. And yet, in his own way, he, was mischievous enough, and ingenious in his mischief. In devising pleasing surprises for his comrades, he was exceedingly fertile; and it was not, unusual for him to take boys much older and stronger than he under his protection, when he saw them imposed upon by others. No boy at school could ever quarrel with him; and he had a juvenile moral power that larger boys could not face; and when, one day, he gave his own new cap to Peter Penniman, an awkward, ragged, and ungainly boy, whose dilapidated hat had been torn in pieces by his school- mates, and went home bare-headed, -fiiiself, there -was not a boy in the school who had taken part against Peter but went home chapfallen, and asliamed'of himself. Indeed, such little acts were almost of every-day occurrence; of little impor:   254 *     GOMEBY OF MiONTGOMERY:  tance in themselves, but all going to show a character of pre- cocious moral development.   The old squire took great delight in the character of this boy, and inculcated all the stern virtues he had learned to appreciate, but iwhich, in his younger days, he had not always been strong enough in his moral self-reliance to carry into effect.  Mrs. Gomery thought her boy a wonder; and yet she feared that such qualities as his would nevermake him the , successful and distinguished man of the world which she hoped lie might be. At this - season, the oldest son of Thomas Homer, whose name was Obededom, and who will be remembered as having figured so conspicuously on the night of the great ball, and who, as has been said, a few months before had had his leg crushed, was the especial care of Walter. The distance across lots from the Pivot to the house of Homer was less than a mile; and every day, unless the weather was so bad as to prevent, Walter went to see his crippled friend, and always took with him something to please him. Obededom, it must be confessed, was not a worthy nor a very hopeful subject for such attentions; and the forbearance that could tolerate his ingratitude, and still continue them, would be regarded by most people as mawkish and morbid. ,In fact, I am not sure but Walter was one of those whom men of . hard, available, common sense would call mawkish, morbid, and sickly sentimental. But, such as he was, he was the embodiment of certain actual, vivid, and transparent quali- ties; and, such as he was made, he is presented to be com- mended, blamed, or despised. Neither charity nor pity is asked for him. Such as he was let him be regarded. He never counted results, or considered what was expedient. If he regarded only what was right, and had no idea of a wis- dom independent of it, then let him suffer for his folly. As his Creator iAade him, let him be judged; but let him who condemns him take heed lest he arrogate to himself virtues that he does not possess, and cannot appreciate in others. During the summer season, it had been the custom of. Walter-to go into the fields, and gather such berries fi om the vines and hedges, and such fruits, as were in their season, and trudge over, with a little basket in his hand containing his ft! to the bed-ridden Obededom. The strawberries of June were earliest; Hand, Ore they had departed, the raspberries    A PAMTTLY- HSTORY.-       25'5 were ripe upon the bushes% which were in turn succeeded by, blueberries in bogs and pastures; and after them- came the large, wild, and sweet blackberries; and, by the time the last were no longer to be found, the early apples were :ripe: so that, for almost an entire season, there was scarcely a day, if the weather were fai, but WAlter could find some- thing that would be a welcome present to his afflicted com- rade. But it was oftener. that he received blame than thanks -for his pains; for Obededom received his gifts without acknow- ledgment, and often found fault because the berries were unripe or over-ripe, or not sufficient in quantity. Then the ingrate would tease him to bring toys and presents made to him by his father and mother, or such as had been sent to him by distant cousins; and, if he replied that he could not do this without the parental leave, the invalid would fly in a passion, and call him mean and stingy, and tell him, that, if he ever got well again, he would flog him lalf to death. These exhibitions of ingratitude and ill-temper would grieve Walter sorely; but he never replied to them, for he attribut- ed all to the cruel pain that ever racked the body of Obed- edom; and, besides that, he saw, that, much as it pained him, it grieved infinitely more another who was ever present at the juvenile interviews and altercations. This was the only sis- ter of Obededom, who at this time, when her brother was thirteen, was nine years old. She was, in all things, the . opposite of him. Before his accident, he had been bluff, bois- terous, rude, and violent. He was the hope of his father, who took pride in his most transparent faults. i His insolence went unrebuked by his indulgent parents; and his domnineer- ing and selfishness were looked upon as hopeful signs. To his sister he had ever been the arrogant master, and could destroy her -dolls and other girlish playthings with-impunity, insensible to her tears, and unresponsive to her love. She , was ever trying to placate his temper and to win his affection. But her acts of affection were as seed sown in stony places; for there was none of the soil of love in his heart in which they could take root. His mother only stood between the two to avert his tyranny; but she, like her husband, regard- -ed his rude disregard of others as indications of promise, rather than signs of innate depravity. The sister had come into the world a creature of the finest and moat sensitive ,organization, and her whole life had Ubeenimbittered bythe bitWx  6   256       GOMERY OF IMONTGOMERY': rude heartlessness of her brother; .but it could not crush lier loving spirit, or cause it to send-forth -any thing but expres- sions of gentleness and love. It is a wonder, that when, so sensitive and affectionate, she had seen her pets ruthlessly killed before her eyes, her doll-babies torn to pieces, and her fine clothes rumpled and torn by her cruel brothler, she had  not sickened and died. Many a time did she steal away to indulge her tears, and, for a time, wish she were dead': but the feeling of active love was so strong within her, that, after a little while, -she would put away such ideas, and think, per- haps, that the fault was her own; and then she would set herself to devise new ways to please her unlovable and unlovely brother. But her efforts met with no response except derision and contempt; and the life she led under the same roof with her brother was so wretched and misera- ble, that she appeared a sickly wee thing, gentle; submissive, and affectionate, yet' so fragile withal, that her 4lease of life seemed doubtful and brief. Yet she was never ill, never com- plaining. Though her form was spare, her cheeks! pale, and her eyes had a look of premature care, yet she never com- plained of being ill; and, whenever bid lby her brother to doi  any task, the whole of her little strength was cheerfully applied to it, hoping thereby to win an approving word. But such words seldom fell to her from a source so barren in affection and gratitude. Her child-heart yearned for some one who could sympathize with her innermost desires; but, as yet, she had been repelled in all her affections. She was as a flower in the desert, and must wither and die if her young soul were not watered by the springs of affection and love. But- like the fading, perishing rose, that, to the last, exhales a grateful odor, she, in her loveliness, only breathed forth thoughts of affection and kindness. At this period of her life, Hester Homer was not what is generally considered a handsome child. She had, it is true, eyes of striking softness and beauty, and was of the most delicate complexion. Her hair was light and flaxen; and her figure, though faultless in fornm, seemed too ethereal and slia- dowy to be of real flesh and blood. , Certainly she' was very different from the healthy, buxom children of that day, who became the mothers of a succeeding generation. The robust health and vigor of constitution and mind, which, in the de- velopedl woman, gave an air of thrift and comfort to the \ .   A FAMLY- HSTORY.        257 houses of the daughters of New fEngland, had no promise in the sensitive, timid, and loving. Hester Homer. It. was only the day before Obededom had met with his- accident that he had played one of his most cruel tricks on his over-sensitive sister. It had always been a delight of his to destroy her pets and playthings. His lasts feat had been to shoot her pet lamb in the eye with his bow-gun; which caused her so much grief, that even her father gave him a severe reprimand, and sent him to bed with a sound flogging, instead of his supper. Even then, Hester begged that she might carry up her bowl of bread and milk to him. This request was refused; though, a little later, she was allowed to go up, and carry him a piece of molasses-ginger- bread. She found the young brute sulky and pouting; and, when she handed him the cake, he caught it, and threw it at her head. She cried now worse than ever at having her kindness and forgiveness spurned; and, creeping away to her own little bed, sobbed herself to sleep. Two days after this, going into the kitchen-yard, carrying in her arms a -Maltese kitten that had been given her the day before, she put it down, and saw it -run at a piece of fresh meat that was lying on the ground. Ith had been thrown there by :Obededom, who, in his wickedness, had attached to it a small fish-hook and line-; and the latter he had tied to a fishing-rod that had been bent to the earth, and, by an ingenious contrivance, set it like a trap, so that, at the least twitch on the line, it would spring into the air. No sooner had the kitten caught the tempting bit in her mouth than the hook caught, at which she gave a twitch, which set free 'the bended pole, that flew up, and held Tpoor pussy suspended in the .air about four feet from the ground. Hester rushed to save her favorite -but the kit- ten did not distinguish between friend and foe, and scratched and bit the arms, hands, and -neck-of its young mistress, so that she was obliged to leave it still pendent from the string. But her screams had brought her mother to the rescue, who quickly released the kitten from the line; when. it fled a'Way in affright, with the hook still in its mouth. Obededom, from a hiding-place, saw the success of his stratagem; and, think- z in, it best not to show himself too soon, ran away to one of the. neighbors. Though forbidden to do so, he insisted on climbing upon a loaded cart, and, within two hours after his feat with the kitten,-he was brought home, his left leg 22*   -258      GOMERY -OF MONTGOMERY : terribly crushed just below the knee. Dr. Purkitt was at once called in, and a messenger was despatched to Bridgeville for Dr. Keezar, and to Tivernet for Dr. Millett. A consultation was held by the three physicians; and it was -decided that they must try and save the leg, though Purkitt was of opinion that amputation would be safer and less- troublesonie. The limb was saved; but Obed- edom-- was subjected to a very long confinement, thiroughout which he suffered the most intense pain. During this trial, he was, if possible, less amiable- than ever, and chafed, fretted, and complained incessantly. The sight of her brother, broughtfhome maimed and sense- less, at once turned to another object the tears and sorrows of Hester, who, until then, could think of nothing but .the cruelty that had been practised on her pretty little kitten, that' had run away and iid with the barbed hook in its mouth, land would not return, though she sought it every- where. During the weary months that Obededom lay on hig back, H1ester seemed to" forget all her other cares and sorrows, and devoted herself solely to minister to his wants, and be- guile the time of his racking pains. But his nature was so entirely selfish, that he had no idea or sense of gratitude, and looked on all attentions received as his by right; and would often snail out so spitefully at his timid little sister, that she would steal away, abashed and in tears, to contrive some new means to conciliate him. '  At first, Walter Gomery, when he came with his gifts to offer to the sick boy, was not allowed to see him. Itiwas thought by the physicians indispensable that he shoul lie entiiely quiet, and therefore must not be excited or distulbed by the presence of other boys. But when it became ,appa-   ] rent that the leg would be saved, and its improved condition rendered slight motion less dangerous, he was admitted; and each day thereafter he was sure to appear with s6mething  that he hoped would be acceptable. In one sense they were so; for if, by any chance, he did not appear; Obededom was sure to be very fretful and queru-  lous, and more testy and ill-natured towards his mother and sister. They both, therefore, were always glad to see Walter come; and though they could not conceal their shame and  regret the ungracious return that Obededom made for his-   A FAMLY HSTORY.        259 kindness, nevertheless- the hours passed off more smoothly when he was present. But the absence, of all sense of gratitude towards Walter was as nothing\- to that displayed towards the unfortunate H Hester. She could do nothing to please him; nothing to provoke a kind word or a grateful smile. ' And yet she was all sweetness', and gentleness, sensitively shrinking back when- ever she approached his bed to adjust his pillow, or offer a plum or a cherry, as if the cruel words that he was to utter- had a power to pterce her very soul.  Walter witnessed the unbrotherly and 'unkind returns that Obededom made to his sister, and his heart was every day moved w  ith pity towards her; and it was not many days be- fore the two had a bond of sympathy between them in the ungrateful returns of him whom they both sought to coneili- iate and serve. The difference in their ages- she being but nine years old, and he nearly fourteen- prevented any of that diffidence and coyness on either side that would have restrained them had she been three or four years older. In- tuitively he saw that she was a child of a most gentle and loving'nature; that her love was'wasted on those who could not appreciate it,'and that it came 'back on her own heart, ithering its best impulses, and drying up the springs of fection. Young as she was, she already had a look of anx- iety and suffering.  She was lithe and sprightly; yet her figure was so light and airy, that she seemed hardly made for earth; -and in the'hard, rough natures of her parents there was no delicate appreciation of an organization and temper- ament so delicate and sensitive. To a close observer of the finer shades of character, it would have been evident that she must ere long have an object qn which to fix her affec- tions, or she must, early die.- It had been -the daily delight of her brother, until his accident, to destroy her playthings and tease her pets. But Walter could appreciate her child- ish efforts to please, and win a return for her loving acts. In a little! time she confided to him her little griefs, and her little plans to please. He entered at once into all her child- i ish devices; and the gifts he intended for Obededom came to him, by the hands of the unregarded Htester. The two w*ould sometimes go off together in the felds and orchards to look for berries and apples, during which times their prin.  cipal talk was of ways and means to please the young in. .;  ;'          .        .   i60:     GOMER, OF MONTGOMERY: Frate lying at home upon his bed. In time, Walter thought much more of the mild blue eyes of Hester than ,of the suf-- ering, churlish Obededom. He found it more pleasant to oiter inthe yard with Hester, playing with her pet chickens tnd ducks -making pens and coops for them, than to sit in- he room of Obed, who never could realize a sense of obliga- ion to any one. The latter saw that -a feeling of affection ,nd confidence was growing up between his sister and Wal- er; and it made him more abusive and rude towards her than ver.. Though he cared not for, her love for himself, he ould- not bear that she should find in another that sympathy rhich he could not feel; and, as the two seemed to find. lore pleasure in being together away from him, he thought hey both wronged him by robbing him one of the other,  nd hated them both accordingly.  But, selfish and unamiable as Obededom Homer was, he  ras not, as this world goes, devoid of redeeming qualities.  n his early years he gave such evidences of t/hrift, that even ago might have commended him; for that worldly philoso-   j her would never have found it necessary to admonish him - ) "put money in his purse. Among his schoolmates he ' ad ever been known as sharp; for he was always ready for a  s rade in jack-knives, skates, jews-harps, and kickshaws; and r  ,was the general experience of all who dealt with him, that e got the best of a bargain. And, though all knew full well  hat he was always the winner in a trqde, he had the tact and  rt to persuade them into experiments of truck and dicker.  X [e gave every evidence of becoming a man of worldly suc- ess. In the6 English sense of the word, he was clever; but I the American he was the reverse. He was sharp, but not miable.  These qualities, early developed, were vastly pleasing to' is father, who was a man of thrift, and was, like too many thers in this wicked world, accustomed to regard a faculty )r acquiring money as the only one really needful. In the irewd selfishness of Obededonm, he saw signs of great prom- e; but, in the gentle nature of Hester, there was little to xcite his admiration. She bade fair to attain to rare beauty she could but gain a little more strength and cleerfulness; nd th'is quality her father and mother b9th regardled as cap- al, that should secure her, not love for love, but a man of rorldly goods. During the long half-year that her brother:   A ]FAMLY HSTORY.        261 lay helpless on the bed, Hester Homer became ve:ry much changed from what she had been at the time of his accident. Her cheek was no longer pale and colorless; and the unhap- py look that seemed prematulrely to have settled on her brow was fast disappearing. She was no longer. brooding over lost pets, or seeking in vain for some one to whom she could approach, and confide her affection. No one of her own family could appreciate her and she was not even al- lowed to love her dolls and 'kittens in peace. If the former were torn to pieces, and the latter worried' and hunted, by her big brother, both her father and mother thought it rather a joke to laugh at than a fault to be rebuked, and scolded her for her tears. But the-coming of Walter had opened a  new life to hler   Of course she felt nothing of that love, which, at a much later period of her life, was to move her young  heart, and send the blood coursing more livelily through her veins. She would have felt equally grateful to any child of her own sex, or -to an old grandmother, if she could only find an object to accept, appreciate, and-return her love., By the time the snow flew, Obededom was so far recovered as to be able to sit in his arm-chair all day; and, before Christmas, he could get about the house./on crutches. Wal- ter 'svisits Were now hecessarily suspended for the most part; for the public school had commenced a month before, and he must be punctual in his. attendance.  There he met, each day, the gentle Hester; and, when she was away from   it, the house of Thomas Homer had small charms for him. I But, as the winter advanced, he thought less and less of them all, including little Hester; and she found, in her school- mates of her own  sex, corresponding returns for that, affec- tion wrhich had-before been lavished almost entirely on Wal- ter. So, when the term ended in the spring, they had both so many other friiends in the school, that they were no longer to each other  lwhat they had been. With the close of tLe school, we  will leave Hester to her desolate life at home.  But, during the past year, the crisis of her childhood has  l passed. Tie flower that was -withering, and like to die, has been revived by the waters of affection, and taken fresh root in the earth. Alas for her! --it had been better that the - sickly bud had then perished.   262       GOMBRY O  MxONTGOMER Y: :CHAPTER XX. 4 HMow rarely Reason guides the stubborn choice, Rules the bold hand, or prompts the suppliant voice   How nations sink by darling schemes oppressed,  TO ES, When vengeance listens to the fool's request!"-DR. JOHNSON. TEIM spring at Montgomery Village opened, if possible, more 'tame and monotonous than usual.. The farmer at tended to their farms, the mechanics' to their shops: there were'neither dancing nor singing parties; .and the attempts at a revival in the early part of the ^inter having proved a failure, and that constant source of amusement and mischief, Joe Pumpagin, having gone away, nothing had ccurred, for three months, of sufficient importance for a tea-table topic. There had not been in all that time a death ovra funeral; and the whole community were suffering for an accident, a quar- rel, or a scandal, that might give them something to talk about. But at last this painful quiet is broken by the arrival of a fine double carriage drawn by a span of stout bays, which, as a matter of course, goes directly up to the Pivot. This carriage, as was suspected, contained some of the rich re- latives of Gomery of Montgomery; and the marvel was, which of them they were. It was soon known, however, that the party consisted of T-homas Fogue, the rich New-York brother-in-law of the squire, his wife, and two children. IThey had been so well pleased with their former visit, and it had' had so good an effect on the feeble health of their youngest child, that they had come, on a second excursion into the hills, intending to make a long family visit. They brought letters from Theron to every member of the family, friom the squire to Walter.

But though Theron saw little of the august Fogue in the city, and, When he did see him, never ventured to speak to him, i he was not so entirely forgotten and neglected by him as he supposed. It was the habit of the rich banker to walk pom- ponsly into the bank, and, with an air .of glreat dignity and self-complacency, take a deliberate look at the clelrks, and no-  tice Carefully the general arrangement; observing if each clerk was properly employed, and kept his desk, books, and papers in neat and systematic order; and' then walk through to his plivate office, and there read his letters, and attend to that general supervising of the bank-affiairs which might be required from a faithful servant of Mammon. This was I about all that Theron saw of the rich banker; and, if he ever encountered-his cousins, they passed without seeming :to rec- ognize him; though, if their -mother wasa:with them, she would always detain him to inquire about his:family in Montgom- ery. , But, on the whole, he found that his relationship was more irksome than advantageous in the performance of his duties. Yet, as has been said, Focrue was not unmindful of him, He noticed his punctuality and industry, and made :sure that his time was not misspent when the ho urs of duty at the bank were over. On his first coming -into the city, and while he was yet a guest at his uncle's .house, the old man had questioned him in his studies, and, giving him a bit of paper and a pencil, asked him to cast the interest on a thousand seven hundred and eighty-three dollars and ninety- one cents, at five and one third per cent annually. The an- :swer was soon given; and as the old mnan!had taken care to have the same question put to an expert clerk in the bank, and had the result on a slip of paper in his pocket, he sagw at once that Theron's figures were correct. This pleased the man of method, and be then asked for a specimen of his hand- writing, at the sight of which he was not so well pleased. Having thus informed himself in regard to the quanlifications of his wife's nephew, he sat himself squarely in his arm-cha, r; and, pushing his gold spectacles back upon his forehead, h e thus addressed him :-- "Theron Gomery, you are the nephew of my wife; for which reason, I shall gve. you -some valuable advice. In the first place, you must underta d,' that, though ybo' aire re . ....-   264      . GOMRY OF MONTGOMEBRY:  lated to my family, you willi not come to this house again for a year. It is not to be supposed that you will move in the  same circles as -my children, as yon must make your own ! way in the world. You must begir at the foot of the laidder. Ad There is where my father began. He commenced by catch.-l ing fish, and selling them out; and, by being plrudent and  careful, he azgumulated money, and bought 'a saack, and sold,  in his own saloon, oysters that his own boat brouaht to the  city. He was great at a stew; and the first I can remember X of him was his standing over the coals in his cellar, cooking  oysters. Buthe made a large fortune; and, when I came to  man's estate, he lived in one-of the best houses in the city of, New York, and had one of the largest incomes. That is the  way for you to do, my boy. Begin at the bottom, and workl up. Be satisfied with your position, and don't try to get  into one where you do not belong. My children will have no need to lbe economical, as you must be, as I have- enough to leave them all rich; and of course you will not expect to associate with them, since they only move in the best soci- ety. Among the old and rich families, it is a point of honor riot to bring in any of their poor relations. We wish to build up an upper class to be a conservative interest in the i country, and keep in check the dangerous tendencies and  power of the democratic masses. We hatve not the position that our wealth would give us in any other part of the world. Even our brethren at the South are better off than we are; for their institutions are better and stronger than ours; givingm property morie power -over labor than it has among us. There a man with large property has great influence; for the poor people are kept down, and, as in England (which country we ought to copy), are so largely dependent on the landlord and capitalist, that they are obliged in all things to follow his lead and-second his wishes. But here, where the fell - spirit of democracy ii destroying all th'e great pillars -of rank and government, what am 1, Thomas Fogue, with all my wealth, more than another man without a hundredth part' as much? My coachmans vote counts the same as mine; and, if I tell him he must vote as I do, he ups and tells me he is not my slave, and that I can -get somebody else if he don't suit me. :And, what is more aggravating still, they make us pay taxes, and educate th'eir children when it is much better for us! not to have them educated, but to man- i ,   A FAMLTTY IISTORY. 1-     -  ;age. -the affairs of government in our own way. But I do not sulpose yocan a undelstand these things tfillly as yet and I give you this .-admonition in time, lest you get into your head the foolish idea that so many upstarits 1aie pratlng albout, that properlty ill be sate if the people lare vell edu- catel. Butt it is a dangerous error. Government. should always be in the hands of those who have most at stake. They arle sule to be conservative, and to kleep things as they ale. You should remrember, if you would be respecte'l by the rich and wise, always to be conservative." Theron harldly knew what to nlake of this speech of the successful ran of business . It was not a speech made for him, but -was a coarse rehash of the bank-office conversation such as was wont to be held in the private office of the banlr by the president and directors of the institution, and which was delivered in an oracular way, as if every word weighed a pound. 'But th/e boy was not so deeply impressed with the sage remarks of bhis superior as the latter supposed; and when the  prosperled man assumed that the  young Gomery moist ever yove in a lower sphere than his cousins, because they were a generation i11 advance of him on the rond to vealth, he mentally ebelled ,a i ns t it, but onlysaid le should' do his duty, and make the nlost of his advantages. On leaving his countly home, Theron  had received good edvice fromn both fathera and mother, and inwardlv resolved to follor it.  ,cDo every thin  vell," said his fithel vell as possible, in starting in ife; andeeverythin(ywill corme asy  to your hand as yoi advanc.

Remember these words, my son, and they shall be- better to yon than houses and lands. An hour of study now will save yoa months of labor herbafter. Therefore my   J parting advice is for you to improve all yourl time for the  first two or three years that you ar6 away froln home; thenl you will not only have formed habits of industry and regu- larity, but your path of life will be free from surprises and  thorns. Dr. Franklin says,---  'He who would thrive must rise at five;     t But he who hath thriven may sleep till seven.' You will find, if -you follow this course, that, though yon  have accumulated little, you have so prepared the way, that  all else will be easy and pleasant. You will have thriven, and you may 'sleep till seven ; for you will know so well hlow every thing is going on, that you will have no anxiety on you mind."            '            i  That this was good advice, every man who has failed and , g blundered through life will admit; and it was not lost on Theron Gomery. He put himself to his work with a will; and, though his life was not enlivened by any sociail intelr- course, it did not pass 'heavily, for. it was always occupied. Ere- the sun was up in the suntncer-time, he was vaway to a free bath in the Hudson, from which 'he returned to readr such books as his father had advised him to pulrchase and  study. His evenings were spent at a night-school, where penmanship and bookkeeping were taught; and, when -the hours of the school were past, he would return to lbis scanti- ly furnished room, and there sit at' his table till his allow- g ance of candle was consumed, practising his new style of calligraphy, and drawing from memory various instru- ments, the forms of which he were given in ]his text-book on bookkeeping. With such habits, he could but make ralp:id  progress; and at the end of a year, when questioned with a view to advancement, if qualified, it was found there was not! a branch of the whole business of which lie did not knojw the entire detiails. He was advanced at once; his salaiay increased; and, instead of being the boy of all work to run at 'everybody's call, he was promoted to a desk, and thencefolth dignified as "Mr." This was the report that good Mr. Fogue took home: to   'i   - .i AMLY HSTORY.       -2G his parents; and when he got a letter from his mother; recit- ing the kind things that Ilhad been said of-him, and Wondel- ing lhow he could so dislike so just and considerate a mnan, as he appeared to do fi'om his letters home, he felt a sort of self-condemnation. But when he remembered the old man's admonition; that he -must not ever expect to move in the samie circles as his own children, his resentment reviied, and he snapped his fingers, and said hewould consider tatt point farther on in the race.  The good character which Fog ue gave to his folks at home was not limited to thefm; but on one occasion, when his aunt from Philadelphia was on a visit to New Yolk witl her 'husband, he told her that her nepliew firom the country was a most excellent boy, the most apt and handy he had ever had in his employ, and was sure to make his way in the world.  This conversation took place at the breakfast-table, where sat the two aunts and their husbands, besides young Lester Fogue, who was the first-fi'uit of the union of Thomas Fogue and Margaret Mackelzie, and was of about the same age as Theron Goanery. "It strikes me," said Mrs. Fogue, ".that, being my sistelr's child, if he is so well-behaved, he might be permitted-to come to the house occasionally." "I  will tell him to come up this evening, so that le may see his Aunt Gilderkin." "I should be delighted to see him," said Mrs Gilderkin; andher husband joined in the request that he might be per- mitted to come and see them in the evening "tIe is a  curiosity," said y oungLester, who felt a great con- tempt for all lis country relations. "How is that," said Gilderkin, if he is sow ell-behaved and so faithful a clerk?             . "A, clefk! a clerk coming here, and so green too!  I hope none of my friends will call this evening if that cub is com- i ng. He hasn t pluck enough to smoke a cigar without it's making hi n  sick and, if you were to offer him a glass-:of wine, he would be so scared, he would want to run home atl tell his mother." "But he had pluck enough to throw you into the horse- )ond, and keep you there till you brought out little Walter's  m .a ohad th  n   in and te served you 'ight hron ine sler - hled his mother  excitedly. --, And,ifyou had been:as ,much                          .Y   ;268 '    GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: afriaid of a glass of wine as he is, your father would not have been obliged to pay a hundred and sixteen dollars for the glass and furniture you broke at one of your rowdy dinners in the City Hotel."  "I thought," said Lestel; turning to his father, "you ap- proved of my associating with gentlemen; and, if I did so, you have always told me not to hind the expense. And now you are praising up this country bumpkin, as if he was an example for me to follow. But Ijwon't see him; I won't ;stay in/the house if he comes here;" and with this he got up angrily from the table, and left the room. i "That is the right spirit," said his father. "I have always encouraged him and all my children to be very choice in their company. Brother Gilderkin, it is such families as ours that are the only hope and safety of the country. Now, the spirit that Lester shows is worthy of a younig English lord or a young Southern planter. I only praised his cousin in order to badger him, so that you might see that I have not neglected the education of my children. I am proud to see them manifest a proper spirit, and -sense of their position.  However, we will have this young Theron up here this even- ing, that you may all take a look at him; but, he must understand that he is not to repeat the visit. I will speak i to him on the matter to-day." Here the conversation ended, and the .:company rose from the table. The two rich men, having smoked their cigars and glanced over the Iporning papers, left the house, and pro- ceeded to walk down town, as Fogue said he found it a good, healthy exercise., They parted at the door of the Bullion Bank; Fogue to go in and attend to business, and Gilderkin to-go farther down,to South Street, to the counting-room of his brother, a large importer. : In the course of the morning, a message was sent to The- ron that the president wanted to see him in his private office. The youth obeyed the summons, and found the portly old man sitting at his table, spectacles on nose, examining somne letters and papers. On seeing the young man enter, lie sat back in his 'chai;r, and pushed up his spectacles till they'rested on his forehead, and motioned the visitor to a seat. Then, looking very wise for about two minutes, he began:-- '"Theron, I have called you in here to express to you my en- tire:satisfaction with your conduct since you have been in the   A FAMLY HSTOR.        269  employ of this institution. I have no fault to find witlh you; and as I informed you when you first came, that, owing to the fact that you had been brought up in lower society than my children          "          -  "Much higher, with all due respect," said Theron. "Young man, you are not to contradict me in my office! None of your impertinence!"  "I had no wish to be impertinent: but when any man un- derrates my father and othei;, and speaks of them as lower than anybody else, I will contradict him; and I don't care Who it is."     -  It is very righbt for you to speak well of your father and mother. They are very good, worthy people, I do not doubt,-very honest and respectable; but, not having moved in our circles, of course they do not understand the genteel and polite ways that are familiar to us. But that is neither here nor there. Your Uncle Gilderkin and wife are at my house; and, as a mark of the appreciation we have of your good conduct, we have decided that you mav come to the house this evening, and spend a couple of hours. But it must be understood, that, in granting this great privilege, no concession is made; and you are not to repeat the visit except by special invitation. gMy son Lester is very proud and se- lect in his company, as I have felt it my duty as a leading member of my class to encourage him to be; and, as none but the sons of those who are in like position with myself, and who .are acting with me to build up an aristocracy like what they have in the old European countries, are accus- tomed to visit him, of course it would not be agreeable to either party to meet the other." - "Certainly it would not be to me." "(Very well, then: we shall expect you at :eight o'clock this evenitng.'"Saying this, the man of money turned to his papers; and the young clerk left the room for his own desk in the other part of the building. From the defect of education which Fogue had observed and commented on, or from some other cause, Theron did not appreciate the honor which the bank president had prof- felred him.  On the contrary, he had a feeling of great con- tempt for him and his opinions; and, as he returned to his desk, he muttered to himself, "When I go to your house, it will not be by dourtesy or condescension ."  23*  ,                  ' ,       '    70      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY:     . The evening came; and the two sisters, Mrs. Fogue and Mr. Gilderkin, sat itn the parlor of the formel, talking over their days of childhood, in the course of which it was natu- ral for them to allude to their sister, Mrs. Gonmery; and this led them to comment on the strange caprice of their sister in taking up with Freeborn Gomery, when she could have commanded the ,hand and fortune of -tle richest man in the country. This, again, led to remarks on the expectant vis- itor, whom the Philadelphia atnt had not seen fob several years, and the other but two or three times since his first ar- rival in New York. The brothers-in-law were in the library,j discussing bank-matters, expressing the greatest concern at the new doctrine lately broached by the President of the na- tion in regard to the great bank of the country. "Brother Fogue," said Gilderkin, "we are not now pre- pared for a Cisis. This interference with the finances of the country by the Government is a great outrage. It is down- right robbery, and a gross outrage on vested lights. It is forcing a crisis that we are not prepared for. A crisis brought about in the legitimate way, at a proper time, is an excellent thing; but it must be worked up by the moneyed'interest of the country, and not precipitated when we are not prepared to take advantage of it., Our securities are not now in the rigyht shape fobr a crisis, and t;le public confidence is so affected already,. that we .shall not be able to improve them; and, thougll we can doubtless protect ourselves from loss, we can make nothing compared with what we could have.done lad - matters been kept quiet, and business gone on prosperously. for a few years longer. Since the last crash, people have not got fairly launched into speculation; and a crisis now would - giYve us nothing compared with What it would do if tle thing were left in our own hands, whbre it belongs, and the Gov- ernment lad the sense not to meddle witli the currency. Then a -well-timed and well-managed crisis would have` swept'by the board a multitude of small jobbers, builders,-- manufacturers, and other stru(ggling adventurers; and all could have been gathered up .by those having surplus capital. By getting mortages and liens on the real property of such,' and then turning a crisis which shall greatly depreciate prices, we can secure all their accumulations to ourselves for one- half its intrinsic value. But, to effect these operations, there  must be a tacit union of capitalists, who must lead people ion i  A FAMLY HSTORY.        271 to speculation andc extravagance, and not contract the cur- i rency until their securities are on real property. Then there is no -actual loss of property in a financial; crash. It only changes from the hands of the active tradesman and opera- tor to the capitalist who has accommodated him. Now, this commendable thrift, and shrewd use of our means, are-all liable to be rendered ineffectual, and set at nought, by the bungling intervention of this bush-fighter now at the head of the Government. In my opinion, his conduct deserves im- peachment. He is breaking up all the safeguards of the Go vernment. With his co-operation, we could have built up a strong, conservative interest that would have been able to shape the policy of the nation; and, by wielding the capital in such a way as to control the labor, would have made the Government strong, central, and conservative." "You say right, Brother Gilderkin. ,You have expressed mly ideas better than I could have done for myself. I con- sider that this wrong-headed man now in the presidential chair has put back the country at least fifty years. And it is all owing to our system of Governmenti We shall always be exposed to civil commotion, and to having our plans thwart- ed, until we have a recognized aristocracy,-an upper and wealthy class, that shall have its distinct place and power in the Government; and it is our duty to unite, and break down this demagogue and innovator, who seeks to destroy all the rights and powels that capital has and ought to have over labor."  "I would willingly aid in that," said Gilderkin, "with my vote, my pen, my voice, and my money, if I could only see how to effect any good result. The people, at least the more ignorant of them, are against us; and as for the President, he has the post of power, and what can we do?" "Do? What is his power compalredlwith ours, if we are but united,! patriotic, and determined? Let there be a gen- eral union of capitalists .against him. Let us call in the money we have got out; let us refuse any more loans; let us compel the manufacturers to suspend their works, destroy credit, and bring onl-general bankruptcy; let the men go about the streets. beSgging for work, the women for bread; and let them understand that all this evil has come upon them through the act of their President,--and they will, if necessary, tear him from the White Itouse, and hang him tod    '272      GOMBRY OF MONTGOMERY : thelgate-post of the Capitol. Force the ignorant multitude to depose him': that is my way!  "You are for strong measures, Brother Fogue; but the e is reason iln what yout say. At least, I will carefilly consider it;  and on my return to Philadelphia we will have a meeting of  our heaviest men, and then we will give the subject our serious' attention. One thing is very clear, -something must be The conversation was here interrupted by a call from the other room, andi the two patriots adjourned to the parlor. "I thought," said Mrs. Gilderkin, addressing Forgue, "we were to see tou-nephe where to-night. You inviteda him; did you- not?"  'IInvited! No; I don't invite my clerks. I told him to come; to be here at eight o'clock; and here it is nearly nine. -That is the way" with these country boys: they have no pro- per respect for those above them."             ! "'You say thalt he is a young man that is attentive to his 'business, and a good clerk?"  "As for that, he is the best I ever saw: he is quick as an . eel, and does every thing in the most perfect and systematic manner. He seems to know every thiling about the bank an-d all its customers; and only last week, at a meeting of the directors, he sent in a memorandum, that, but for the imtpor- tant nature of its conteits, would have caused, his immediate dismissal for impertinence." '"How wa s that, Brother FoTue?" c; It was in this way: One of our heaviest debtors, it seems, -had got into a bad way, and was privately disposing of lbis goods. But he had not got every thing, ready for a grand failure; for he wanted to have his accounts once more bal. anced with us, and then he would expect to enlarge his mar- gin, and overdraw to a large amount. This note firom The- ron Gomery was simply a suggestion, that when he made his next deposit, preliminary to balancing the books, his account shouldl be closed till his affairs could be investigated. On reading this note to the board, every one of the directors was as indignant as if the cashier had absconded withhis trank-full of money. In fact, I was quite angry myself; and , we all considered it a piece of piesumption, impertinence; and insubordination, besides being a gross slander on one of our best customers, a'- a man of large means, and doing a find   I A rAMjlY HSTORY.        273- business. So a vote was taken that he be permitted to rie- si gn his position. Afterwards it was decided to follow his ;advice, and not notify him of his dismissal till the result was known. The next day, the nman's account was squared; and thbe day after, a note was sent tq him, that, as the bank was about to contract, it would not, for the present, accommodate himn any further. The next morning his store was not opened, and it was found he had made the worst failure of the sea- son.. But for that note, he would have got thirty or perhaps fifty thousand dollars; and, that afternoon, when we had a special meeting to consider the case, finding that this boy had saved us the money, we reconsidered our vote to ,dis- charge him, and it was left to me to give him such repri- land as, in my judgment, his impertinence deserved." "Then the only reward of his fidelity was a reprimand?" said Mrs Gilderkin.           -  'But I'never alluded to the subject," said Fogue. "I thought I would spare his feelings." "Spare his feelings!" she exclaimed excitedly. "Peter," she added, turning to her husband, "I don't think Brother Thomas gives Sister Jane's boy a fafir chance. I propose that we have the other one go with us to Philadelphia. What say you?" I am willing if you are" said Gilderkin. cIf he is like, this one, I am not afraid but I can stand his vulgar ways. So you can writh to your sister Jane, and tell her that-- what is the next one's name?" "Wirtimir,;" answered his wife.  "' What names they find for their children! Tell Jane that if she will let Wirtimir come and begin with me, as Theron did with Brother Fogue, he may come, and he shall live with US." "I am astonished at you, Brother Gilderkin," said Fogue, "that you, should take a country boy with all his rough manners and vulgar ways into your ho se." "He can't be rougher or greener. than I was at his age," said Gilderkin, "Ah! my dear sir, with all your sound ideas on finance and money-mnaking, you have no proper sense of the dignity- and duties of your position and class. We must keep dis- tinct from those below us, and make more broad and clear -th - line between u who h^ve inherited wibalth, ahd the vulgar upstarts who have made their own money." ;   k   - GOMERY O'. MONTGOMERY:            ':"I think, Brother Fogue, you are carrying your ideas a little too; far. :- My father, 'you know, honest man, was- a poor farm_-; er; and, until I was eighteen years old, I worked on his farm-: as hard as any drudge; but, when it was found that thelre was avaluable coal-mine on his land, he at once became rich-., I havs  heard you boast frequently that your father was the best hand at an oyster-stew in New York.   So, as it- seems to me, our lineage is neither so ancient nor honorable that we should pride ourselves too much upon it, or despise all whose fathers did, not accidentally find coal-mines or cook  oysters."                               /I -"I -am -aware we have not the advantage of a long and honorable ancestry, as the higher classes have in older count- tries; lbut it is our privilege to found such a class, and, as-the first in ;the line, we shall have the more honor with: future generations. If we were.to trace baclh the first families of England a sufficient time, we should doubtless find a link where the head of it was no-better than an oyster-dealer or smtnall farmer; and, yet they are prouder of the noss-trooper of five` hundred years ago than of' his descendant of the last generation who-was a lord or archbishop. If we can only- lay the foundations of an aristocracy, we need have no fear of -not being respected two hundred years hence." "Small comfort that will be to us. However, to come back to the subject, I am disposed to make a trial of the other Gomery boy. But I would have liked to have seen this one.": "I shall give him a severe talking to n the morning," said Fogue., "(Perhaps he was looking after-another of your lame cus- tomers," suggested Sister Gildelrkin.  /  The next morning, as threatened, Theron was summoned again to the rear office of the bank. The banker looked stern and displeased, and did not ask the young man to be seated. Pushing back his spectacles, and directing a look that he intended should make him tremble before him, he began: -  "You were not up at my house last evening." "I am aware of that," said Theron with a coolness that - somewhat disconcerted the old man.  .'? And why, silh did you not come ?"               . : " I did not wish to go  and that was reason enough."  "But :I wished yru to; -and I am to be respected in my wishes." t    ,i   ("In business-hours, you, have the- whole of my time and my best services; but out of business-hours I am my ownt master, and go where I please." "Young man, you are insolent! You shall leave the; bank!" '"That is just what I desire to do," replied Theron with 7 an air of indifference. " But you shall have no recommendation." "I don't want any. I am offered a thousand dollars a year more than I get here, besides ,being promoted, in the bank opposite." "Leave the room!" said the excited Fogue, getting up from his chair as if to enforce prompt obedience. Theron, however, required neither force nor a second order, but with- drew quietly, and returned to his desk. Here was insubordination indeed! The lion had been bearded in his den. His threats had been flung back at him with defiance, and there was no remedy. The young clerk was too clever for the-conceited capitalist. The old man paced the room for a short time, and then sat down again at his desk. "That is just the way," said he, "whenever genteel people attempt to do any thing' for their vulgar poor rela- tions., Bit they are not my relations, thank God! There is none of the Fogue blood so low anid base as that; so want- ing in respect for rank, position, and deference to the higher classes. Now, we can't spare the boy very well; and he would not think of leaving if he had any sense of gratitude. I took him in here when he knew nothing about business; and now, after all my care, he is going off when we have no one to take his place. What depravity! And yet we can't let him go.' All the board will want to know thbe reason-. And yet I know he will go. I have told him to leave; and go he will, if I don't call -him back. I will send word to him by Jenks. Jenks and he are great cronies. I will tell Jenks to say to him, if he will rake an apology he may stay." Af- ter reflecting on the matter for about half an hour, he rang the bell for the enTand-boy; who instantly appearing, he bid him tell Jenks that he wanted to see-him. Jenks quickly obeyed the summons; and the old man, con- :  trary to his custom, bade him be seated. - Then sitting backin his chair, and raising his spectacles to his forehead, he began:- Mr. Gomery, my nephew (or rather my wife's nephew)   27 60EGOBY OF MONTGOMERY : has used very improper language to me, and I have told him to leave but, considering his former' good conduct, you may say to him,.that as he must expect to make his *way in the world, and I don't want to be- lard upon him, and his mother will take it unkindly of me if I send him away, he may apolotize and stay."' ,Thlat, will be quite uniecessaury, said Tenks; ,for, he h'as ready sent in his resignation, and you will find it in the let- ter-box in the front office; and he has also written another letter, to the President of the Bank of Security, saying he ac- cepts his offer, and will commence at the first of the next quarter."   i "How is that? How did the Bank of Security know any thing about him?"                -  ' One of the directors of the Security is an uncle of mine, and one day met Gomery at my father's house; and, getting into talk with him about banks and exchange, he found him so well-informed and familiar in both the principles and de- tails of banking, that he invited him to dine at his house a few weeks ago." "Dine at his house! A clerk! He has never dined at my house, for all he is my wife's nephew." , He dined there at the same, time with the President of the Security; and, as he thinks he knows more about bank- ing, and national wealth, and political economy, than Say or Adam Smith ever dreamed of, he soon got into a discussion with my uncle, who, finding'himself getting the worst of it, called on young Gomery to help him out; land the result was, those two had a discussion that lasted two hours, and my un- cle thought the old man got the worst of it. When they parted, the old president told him he had good parts, but had much to learn. Soon after, he invited him to his house ; and now he verily believes that Theron Gomery knows more about bankinag than any man in America,- save only Nick Biddle and himself. And, what is more, he is engaged to his daughter Letitia; and you know she is an only child, and is one of the richest heiresses in New York." "What! Theron Gomery engaged -o Letitia Pickering! Said Fogue in amazement. "Do you say my old friend Stephen Pickering, the President of the Security, gives his o..n nt that his daughter shall marry such a country clown as Thrbn normery, who hasn't a dollar in the world?   A FAMLY HSTORY.        2" J                       1  ,1 ; U He consents that she shall marry Theron Gomery, and is much pleased at the prospect." Fogue dropped his head at this, and told -Jenks to leave. "Is the world gone mad?" said he. "Theron  to marry Letitia Pickering! Has the old man no respect for his posi- tion?-- none' for his class? - He is as prone as I am to a priv- ileged class, to an established aristocracy; yet he allows my wife's nephew, whom I 'do not permit to darken my door, and who has never yet, and never shall, cross his legs under my mahogany, to come to his house, and marry his daughter, when he must have known that she should marry Lester. I wonder what Mrs. Fogue will say to this. It was all her' work, bringing the country bumpkin into the city. I never approved of it." And as for Lester, I know he will kill him. He has great spirit, that boy!-very much like his father. What is the world coming to? Surely- the times are out of joint." And with such reflections the capitalist tried to re- sume his labors. 24 ;    . 1!   278-    a  OMZCBY OF MONTGO3LERY: \       ' ' CHAPTER Xxte I It's hardly in 4 body's power To keep, at tim-, frae being sour, To sec how t ings are shared; How best o' chi elsarc whiles in want, While coofs on countless thousands rant, Atnd ken na how to wair't. - BURNS, TaH favTorable reports received at/the Pivot, of the good conduct and rapid proficiency of the eldest son, had the effect of stimulating a desire in the next on; to go forth and try his fortune in the great world. As is not unfrequently the case, when the oldest of a fimily of boys enters reso- lutely and boldly into the battle of life, he furnishes the best example possible for those who are to come after him; and, if there be no radical innate difference of organization and character, in all probability the feeling of home rivalry that existed among them as boys will develop in them, as men, into energy, perseverance, and honorable ambition. In start- ing off from home, their great desiie is that those they leave behind them-for they have -theni no other public to please -will hear good-reports of their conduct, and be cheered by news of their success. If one has gone before them and good I reports have come back of his conduct and success, they then feel that they have a standard which they must at least equal, if not excel, and that any thing short of tasta will cause sorrow and disappointment at home. But- if the. eldest has proved a thriftless, graceless idler, the next one, when he ventures away, will have less faith in himself, less courage to undertake; his standard will be less elevated, Iis aim lower; and if he avoids thile evil ways of the ellest, and very likely pet son, so that relatively he is the better con- ducted of the two, he rests there, and aspires to notlhing btt- ter. T-be eldest, therefore, has a great responsibility; for the road he takes will most likely be followed, with more or less defleoions, by his younger brothers. i    .  -                   i  ,  r    /  *                    e I'    x   A FAMLY- .HSTORY.  .     279  . r Accordingly, when Wirtimir saw how rejoiced his father and mother were at the reports which came to them of The- ron's good conduct, and how proud his sisters JulietAnd Rose were of his success, he was natuially eager to distin- guish himself in the same way. He becate discontented at home, and was pressing that he might have "a place" in New York. When told of the severe solitarylife thathis brother had been I compelled to lead for the first year anid a half of his city residence, he scouted the idea that - he would , shrink from any hardship or any duty. He feared nothing if he could only have the opportunity to learn and improve. The days seemed long to him, for they appeared to be time wasted; and his native hills no longer had" any charm for his discontented eyes. He was in this uneasy frame of mind ' when his mother received a letter from her sister, Mrs. Gil- derkip, proposing that he should go and live with her family in Philadelphia, and be a sort of clerk to her husband, look- ing after his affairs, ayl learn the ways of doing business and gaining money. An invitation was also given to his elder sister,Juliet, to accompany llim, and pass the winter in the city of brotherly love. The invitation was accepted for both; .and as the Journey ' was a long one, and the means of travel very different from what they are now, it was finally decided that the old squire should accompany them. Preparations for the journey were immediately commenced; but it was two weeks before they were ready to start. The old family carriage which had been built in the village according to the lawyer's own de- sign, and more with regard to convenience and comfort than display, was sent to, the maker's to have the tire reset, to be repainted and furbished up for the journey. Within-doors, all were busy ill making ready for the journey; and, to accel- erate the work, Miss Wellington, 'the fashionable tailor," was brought to' the house to make an entire new suit'for the lawyer, and such clothes as it was supposed Wirtimir would wear out before .he could outgrow them. Juliet and Rose were busy iin making, sorting, and packinog all the fine things which it was supposed a young lady would require in a great city. , At length, all was prepared. The old carriage looked as good as new; and the two' stout horses, that brought a ready ' shoulder to draw the plough or take the family to church were '          .        .        '   280 1   -   GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: round and fat; and when the load was all taken on board, and the good-by said, away they moved, at a brisk trot, on their long journey.  The equipage and general turn-out of Gormery of Mont- gomery on this occasion, though plain and unassuming, gave evidence of more substantial swealth than "was often seen in the family carriages of the people in that part of the country. Incleed, to- the eyes of the common folk along the road, it had quite an ambitious look as it drove along past their quiet farm-houses. The old squire felt happy, and so did Juliet and Wirtimir after the first few miles had been passed over, and the road became less familiar to their eyes. At first, they could not refrain from casting back regretful, sad, and, lingering glandes on the now receding scenes of their Child- hood. During- the journey, they, met with few incidents worthy of note. -They put up at the best of the good old- fashioned taverns on the roada; and, as their appearance indi- cated them to be people of a betterposition than ordinary travellers, they had the best apartments and the best fare that the different public-houses could afford. But, as they approached the city, they observed that their old-fashioned covered wagon, that was thought a very stylish affair at Montgomery Village, was but a sorry-looking vehicle as com- pared with the splendid carriages that rolled by them in the outskirts of the city; and their stout old farm-horses cut a dismal figure cominpared fwith the prancing roadsters that proudly dashed by them along the finely gravelled turnpike. Very near the city, in those days, there was a publie;water- ing-trough, which was fed by a spring, and which served to water the thirsty animals of both teamsters and travellers. Here the lawyer pulled up his horses to refresh them for the last time previousi to entering the city. At a little distance from the trough, engaged in'the healthful exercise of throw- ing stones at the windows of an old, uninhabited house, were a couple of barefoot, ragged, dirty urchins, who might have ' been taken for specimens of Young America, except that that interesting and hopeful individualIwas not then in exist- ence. ' I say, Bill," said one of them: "ain't that a he old go-cart?" "I reckon that' is the same that old Peter the Headstrong used to ride in," replied the other.        , f "You old fool you! that Was made before old Peter's'   A FAMLY HSTORY.        281 grandfather was a little boy.

And you youngster there: what is your name? Is it Shem, or Ham, or Japhet? It ain't Ham, 'cause he was a nigger." , "I say, old Noah, what did you let all them sarpents into the ark for?" "I 'spect that is Eve, that woman: ain't it, Bill? She is handsome enough."  /"No: you ignorant crittur you! Eve wa'n't Noah'swife." she wa'n't in the ark." "4 She was some relation, anyhow; and how do you know  ? sh" wa'n't in the ark?"  The horses, having drunk their fill, were turned into thef rozd, and started on their way; and the rest of this discus- sion on biblical history between these learned pundits was not heard, and probably is lost to the world. It was near three o'clock in the afternoon when the quaint family carriage of Giomery of Montgomery turned downT Wall Street from Broadway, and stood before the Bank of Bullioln. The lawyer, giving the reins to Wirtimir, descended; and, entering the bank, inquired if Mr. Fogue was in. The teller, who was the person addressed, seeing a stranger with the ,appearance of a countryman, replied, "Yes, sir; he is in: but it is past his hour of business, and he' can see no one.. He is busy." "Busy, is he? Well, you tell him that Freeborn Gomery is here,--better known as Gomery of Montgomery; that his daughter is with him, and his son: tell him that, sir, if you please, and be very quick about it!" This, uttered in a loud and authoritative tone, caused all the other clerks to look up; and the teller addressed, turn- ing to an under book-keeper, bade him tell the president that a man wanted to s,ee him.            , - "Tell him that Freeborn Gomery wants to see him. And where is my son? Isn't he here,--my boy Theron?" Here the clerks began to titter, all except Jenks, who ad- vanced, and said very blandly, "Ah! Mr. Gomery, I ]ro- Pumae. Happy to meet you! Your son left here a few days tsince, and is now at the Security Bank opposite'." "Left here! H* it that?"            i 24* -- ' .    .    .        .'   /282:  '  GOMERY OFP MONTGOMERY: The door into the rear office was now opened; and the president advanced, confused and embarrassed. Here had  his brother-in-law, with his broad-brimmed hat and his Polly Wellington clothes, all well covered with dust, an- nounced himself before all his clerks; and thus was he, the founder of an aristocracy, confounded. But, putting on the best face he could, he advanced, and, extending his hand, said,- "Indeed, Mr. Gomery! I hope you are very well! Walk into my office."                '" "3But my son and daughter are waiting in the carriage." "In a moment we will attend to them," said Fogue, cldraw- ing his brother-in-law inside the door, and closing it, so that the clerks should not be witnesses of the scene. "Take a. seat, Mr. Gomery! I hope you left your folks all well." "Yes, sir, very well," said he somewhat sternly, and still standing; for it had not escaped himn that his affectionate brother-in-law secretly wished him to the Devil. "(Well, I am delighted to see you, and am very sorry it I has happened so that your visit is at such a very unfortunate season. You, see, my house is now full of very fashionable company,--the son and daughter of a frienil of mine in Georgia, a man of great wealth, and connected by blood or marriapge with all the great Southern families, and descended from the old Cavalier stock of Virginia; and- I say it with pride, sir-- the ancestor of my friend was killed at Mars- ton Moor by some of Cromiwell's psalm-singing Roundheads. His son and daughter, as I, said, are at my house; and we are having a great deal of very fashionable company. We, even expect, an English lord: yes, sir, an English lord,- Lord Noddlekin, a distinguished member of the great aris- tocracy of England, who arrived in the last packet. Yes, sir, we expect him to visit our house; and of course you will not wish to bd there, as y'u know the company will be so different from what you have up at Montgomnery Village. The young ladies there will bei the -most fashionable in New York; .and several of the old Dutch families have promised to come who were never there before, in, order to meet Lord Noddlekin; and they would take it as a great offence if I were to invite any common folks there with them." 'While Fogue -was thus excusing himself for his refusal of hospitality to his brother-in-law, his confusion and pride   A FAMLY IIISTORY.        283 were strangely intermingled. He was ashamed of his boor- ishness, but could not conceal his exultation when speaking of the distinguished visitors expected at his house. HiR face flushed, first with shame, and then with pride; but a; Gomery stood unmoved, with a perplexed though stern look upon him, he felt he must propose something, and so said,-- "But. we have excellent hotels here. There is the great City Hotel, where all the great people go. But, as it is very flshionable, perhaps you would prefer the Bleeker Street, which-is a -very good one, and a great many respectable farmers from the country put up there with their teams; and here, he continued, sitting down to the table, "I will just write a note for you to take to the landlord to tell him I will pay all the bills. You know, I want to be hospitable." TYou unmannered' hypocrite! ' exclaimed Gomery of Montgomery in a voice that could be heard in the next room, and caused the clerks to hold their breaths, "do you think I have come here to ask charity or favor from you ?" "Hush! hush! not so loud!" said :Fogue, looking up, ashamed and supplicating; afraid, above all things, of having the conversation overheard. "Send your clam-diggers and oyster-spawn to Bleeker Street; but don't insult mne again by proposals to pay my tavern-bills, or I shall throw you neck and heels out of your own window"  Fogue sank down in his broad arm-chair, looking the very picture of cowardice and shame, and as 'if he feared that his brother-in-law would put his threat in execu- tion. But Gomery only looked i-t him as at a reptile be- neath his contempt, and then, turning on his heel, walked out: with an   elephantine tread that made  the building quake.  The clerks, who had overheard the loud and angry words of Gomery, had also from   the window caught sight offJuliet sitting in the carriage in front of the bank.  The outer door of the bank had been    closed just as Gomery had entered (the hours for business with customers closing at that time) - and the clerks, snuffing some fun from the pompous old pres- ident, had  gathered near the windows that looked out on the -street. " ,Look!' said Jenks, who was the first to get a sight of Juliet, - look! isn't that a beauty ? " "By the  powers!" said another, "is that Gomery's sis-   284i      GOMEIY d0i0 MONTGOMERY: " Of course it is: isn't she handsome.?" "Handsome?- - all New York can't touch her. See! the people on both sides of the street are stopping to look at her." The heavy tread of the elder Gomery, as he stalked an- grily out, interrupted this conversation. Juliet and Wirtimir saw a thunder-cloud on their father's brow as he came out, such as they had never seen before. "Where is Theron?" asked Juliet. "Over here," said he, crossing over to the other side. "Drive over here to this side, Wirtimir." The boy obeyed; and the old man entered the door of the Security Bank, which was not yet locked, though business hours were past. He had no sooner approached the counter than his son happened to cast his eyes in that direction, and instantly recognized him. Eagerly he flew through the gate- way that cut off the clerks' apartment from the public, and grasped the old man by the hand. "HoV is this?"'- said he. "I wasn't looking for you. How is mother? how Juliet and Rose? and how Walter and Wirt? and how is everybody?"The clerks of the Security looked up, and smiled at the joyful enthusiasm of Theron; and, just at this moment, President Pickering came in from his private office,; when the young man proudly turned to him, and said, "Mr. Pickering, this is my father; and I am so glad to see him!               ' "Ah!" said the president: "your father! I am delighted t to see you, sir. I have known your son only a short time, and I am proud to know the father of such a son." "I am glad that the boy pleases you,7 replied Gomery, "though I was not expecting to find him here." Then, turn- ing to Theron, he told him that'Wixt and Juliet were in the wagon at the door. At this the young man hurried hatless into the street; and such a hearty greeting passed between the parties, that the people, who before stopped and stared, now stared and won- dered. Fogue, of the Bullion, saw this scene from his window, and thanked his stars that he had got rid of his country rel- atives so easily, notwithstanding he heard his clerks giggling aild laughing in the next room, and was well aware that they were witnesses of the scene in the street. But his joy was r?   A, AFAMTLY HSTORY.  .     285 turned into astonishment when he saw his much-respected friend Pickering, President of the Security, follow his clerk, bareheaded, outof the bank to the rustic old family carriage of Gomery of Montgomery, and give both Juliet and Wirt a warm shake of the hand. Then, agape, he saw the boy descend from the carriage, and the President of the Security re-enter the bank, and soon return, with hat on and cane i hand, and get into the carriage with Gomery and his daugh- ter, when they all drove away. Theron and Wirtimir en- tered the bank, but returned directly, and followed the car- riage on foot. "How much good that man might do," soliloquized Fogue, "'if he only had proper social ideas! With his fortune'and influence, he could do more towards forming a correct public opinion, and establishing the necessary distinctions between; classes, than any man in New York. But he has no sense of his position or duty to his class. On the whole, I think it is as well for Lester to marry the daughter of my Georgia friend. It is true, she is' not very handsome, and has no edu- cation; but she has two plantations, and belongs to one of the oldest families. If Pickering will fiaternize with such low people, we must let him go, and build up Our aristocracy with- out him.       a      .  Good old Jesse Pickering, who was thus delinquent in his duties to his class, had very different ideas of propriety from his neighbor over the way. His early days had been differ- ent, and with his mother's milk he had imbibed other ideas of, the world.. Fogue, as, we have heard him confess, had come up from a labor almost menial; andi as his wealth came, pouring-in upon him, his great struggle was for position. His- money came easier and faster than social respect, for refinement was not natural to him; and his idea of the, value of money was. that it was mainly iuseful as a means of main- taining social distinctions. Hence he grew. up a fawning sycophant at the feet of those having social standing and in- fluence, 'while he passed with haughty-indifference those who were not thus favored. And yet he had many redeeming qualities. Though shrewd and sagacious in business, he was just and honorable in all his transactions. He was public- spirited, .and gave liberally to public charities. His heart was liberal, and his hand was fiees But early rebuffs when seeking position had- burnt into his very nature; and he was   '286      GOMERY OFP MONTGOMERY':    , like too many people of like experience, who, having come up from the dung-hill, from that rich soil have grown rank and lusty in wealth, and are afraid of being contaminated by contact with people once their equals. Such people are always talking of rank and position in society, and make their attainment the great end of life. You shall know a man, and more especially a woman, of vulgar antecedents and connections, lby their proneness to talk of the genteel people and greati folks whom they have known. They are so fearful of being-confounded with their own kind, that they are ever reminding you of their distinguished and fashionable friends. On- the other hand, Jesse Pickering had no fearnof having his position mistaken or his importance undervalued bv rea- son of his courteous and familiar bearing. towards all men. His early years had been spent in a country village not far from New York; and though his father had been a man oTf small fortune, yet the family was as much respected as any in the place; and in his boyhood he was not aware that there was any society above that in which he lived, or which he looked up to with covetous eyes. Hence he never knew the bitterness of being excluded from any society he cared to move in.'. He had come to New York, a young man, to look after what was then a small property that had been left to him at the decease of a maiden aunt: This consisted of a house and three acres of land, at a small distance from the city as it then was, and which he had the sagacity never to sell. Twenty years after, the same property had increased a hundred-fold; and twenty years later still, which was about the time- to which this history has arrived, lie ranked as one of the richest men in'the-city, and was on terms of intimacy and familiarity with all the people of established wealth, in- cluding, of course, the rich descendants of the web-footed Dutch dames, of whom the historian of New York makes elegant mention. Being thus independent, he could consult his own tastes, and could. afford to disregard the rules of so- ciety, by having such intimates and visitors as he liked, with- X out regard to their wealth or social position. He was there- fore firank an familiar with the poor and rich alike; and in this he was the exact contrast of Fogue, whhoiwas afraid of being contaminated, or classed with the poor and vulgar,/if he did iot- -assume: a bearing of haughty superiority, and-keep them at a proper distance.   A FAMLY HHSTOtY.       287 For the two days and a half that Gomery tarried in New York, he and his daughter were the guests of Pickering. Wirtimi, however, stopped at a boarding-house,-lower down - town, where his brother lived. Juliet captivated the hearts of all with whom shei came in contact; and -she and, Fanny Pickering--now engaged to her brother -were confidential friends at sight. Gomery of Montgomery occupied his time while in the. city in looking at its wornders, of which he had ? read much, but which he had never seen before, -its fine buildings, large wharves, and the fleets of shipping riding at anchor in front of, the city. The President of the Security put his carriage and driver at his disposal; and the old man in his broad-brim and Polly Wellington clothes was driven through all the principal streets of the city; the people gen- erally taking him for a Western governor or a foreign lord. Juliet busied herself in improving her wardrobe for the win- ter campaign in Philadelphia; and her great delight was in walking up and down Broadway with her friend Fanny, to call her attention to what was most worthy of notice, re- ceiving hints as to what was or was not in the fashion, and. making such purchases as suited the wants. and tastes of the . two. But the lawyer and capitalist could not agree in politics. Freeborn Gomery was, as we have seen, a man inclined to think for himself; and his principles were based on his own observations and reflections. For the opinions of other men he cared very little, though he cared a great deal for the facts and data on which they were founded; and, when pos- sessed of them, he had a logic of his own, and formed his own conclusions. His natural sense had never been biassed by prejudice, or warped by false ideas; and hence he took men as they were, and valued them at-their intrinsic worth. If he met with native wit and honesty, it mattered little to him that -its possessor G" dined -on homely fare, wore hod- den gray, and a'.that." In politics, he was a radical Demo- crat in the best sense of the term; and hence he could  never reconcile it with his system of logic, that it was just or honest to keep :in bondage an entire people, whose \ wrongs were increasing with their numbers, and whose rights it was growing more difficult each year to acknowl- edge. - Pickoring, in his way, was as just and liberal as Gomery, just and ,   .    ^2:88     GOMERY ?MONTGOMERY: Indeed, in some respects,/he was more so. But his experi-, once and way of life had led him to regard the masses of mankind as of importance only so far as they contributed -to the aggregate wealth of the country. The public happiness, and general education and improvement of the masses, :ere, in his eyes, matters of trivial importance, compared, with that regular business prosperity which allows capital to roll on like a snow-ball, gradually accumulating' all the damp flakes that havie fallen on the ground before it. And he was right in that, perhaps; as doubtless the people will elevate themselves to a more healthy position than under any en- forced system of protection, if they are left free to work out their own improvement.  But he went somewhat farther than this; and, in his dread of innovation, was so prone to conservatism as to oppose needed reforms. But, in this re- spect, he was far-more liberal than Fogue, who regarded it as-an offence against society and order for any one to seek, by elevating the masses, to lessen the distinctions between them and the upper classes. Both were disciples of that po-  litical school of which Hamilton was the recognized leader, and looked upon the ideas of natural rights, as set forth by Jefferson, Franklin, and Tom Paine, as dangerous heresies. Hence the'conversations that passed between Gomery and -his -host were of a political character; and so intent- was each, on convincing the other, that many matters were neg- lected on which the lawyer was especially anxious to be in- formed.. On somne subjects the banker could enlighten him. But many of these were not introduced; and all his time was talien up on abstruse questions, of which one knew no more than the other, and both were resolved to be neither enlightened nor convinced. Two full days Gomery had allotted himself to spend in New York, ,and so, on the morning of the third day after his arrival, the old-fashioned' team was brought up to the A door, and the lawyer, his son and daughter, took their seats, and,'with a hearty "God speed you," resumed their way. They were expected. at their Uncle Peter's in Philadelphia, and met with a reception more cordial than they had antici- pated :after their rebuff from their New-York relatives. Gorery remained there two days; and then, with a sorrow in his heart -at parting with his children such as he had nveer!feltIbefore, hecommenced his journey homewards. :,   '. I.

FROM   its cormmencement, the village of Montgomery had been a thriving place; It had been fortunate in its early set- tiers; for, as was said long since, the original proprietor of the tract where it stood, Robert Goiner g hadc been very par- ticular respecting the habits arid character of those who wished to buy land, and settle in 'he vicinity. Beyond most villages of its time, it had been distinguished for the sobriety of its inhabitants; and only under the, potent influence of Joe Pumpagtin's tongue, and the more potent influence of his flip, had any thing like a drinking-bout been known. The consequence of all this-was that the people were gener- ally in prosperous circumstances; and& as the population waxed numerous, like the uneasy, contriving, innovating New-Englanders generally, they got an idea that they must have something better than- the ordinary town-schools for the education of their 'children. Somehow the Yankees have an-intuitive sense of. Bacon's maxim, that knowledge is power;" and the first thing they think of, when they have set want at a distance, is to give their children a better edu- cation than falls to the lot of those who have only t1e-prlivi- leges of the free schools. The parents do not labor to accu- mulate property for their children to inherit, so much as to employ it in educating them; believing that money thus ex- pended in youth will bear fruit in manhood a hundred-fold.   290   -   GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: Now, the good people of Montgomery Village lhad, like Freeborn Gomery, on many occasions sent their children, as they got somewhat advanced in their studies, to distant acad- emies; and, as they did not like the idea of thus paying tribute to other villages of less population and imnportance 'than their own, the project was started of having an academy ' of their own. It was-not till about the time that Thelon Gomery left his home to begin life in New York, that the plan of an academy was seriously talked -of; and then, though by the time the building could be completed, and , the institution opened for pupils, it was probable that Lawyer Gomery would not have left at home more than one of his children to benefit by it,.he nevertheless entered zealously into the scheme, and offered to give the ground for the site, and twice as much as any man in the village besides. This liberality was so far imitated by others, that the money neces- sary for the building was subscribed; and, a year after, it -was opened in due form, a recent college graduate accepting the post of principal, and a sentimental lady of mature years, who taught French without being able to speak or read it, and who could tell the language of every flower and plant from a-violet to, a pine-tree, was engaged as assistant. The academy was first opened on a bright December morning; and among those who attended at the commencement were Walter Gomery and Obededom and Hester Homer. It had been the -intention of both Freeborn Gomery and his wife to give Walter a college education if lie sho-uld have any inclination for it himself. Accordingly, as he was already well- advanced in arithmetic, English grammar, and geography, he now began to study Latin and Greek. "At schbool he was the favorite of all save one; and that was Obededom Homer. Obededom disliked him because others liked him; and as :he had now recovered from his"wound, and was a large, stout boy, with a deformed leg, he gave vent to his vicious disposition, and sought every opportunity to annoy Walter. However, as he could get neither coun- tenance nor sympathy at school, he'contented himself by ceaselessefforts to afinoy his much-forgiving sister, knowing that she had a childish liking for Walter, and that, when he -made her cry, it pained him a thousand times more than if he himself were the direct object of his malice. Somehow these two children, more by force of circumstances than from:any   A -FAMLY HSTORY.  ,     291 other cause, came to havelsuch mutual confidence,that they told their griefs to each other for sympathy, and also their -hopes and pleasures, that each might share the othel-'s joy. As children, they paired like young birds; and, as they got -older, they regarded it as a matter of course that -they were 'to -grow up, and be man and wife. lM rs. Gomery saw these -evidences of youthful attachment; and notwithstanding the contempt for all the Homers, from the great bard down to young Obededom, which she expressed the morning after the -great ball, she had it not in her heart, so gentle and innocent was Hester, to interfere with the developing affection of the Youthful pair. The peculiar, eccentric character of Walter bhad brought out in her a finer and tenderer feeling than she had ever known, when, a young mother, she proudly scorned comparison between her child and that of another equally proud and hopeful of the child resting in her bosom. As Walter grew older, his character seemed to harden, and to lose somewhat of its eccentricity. With such precocious virtues, it might reasonably be expected of him, that, like the traditional "good little boy that died,", he should follow his example, and be laid in the churchyard. But this he per- versely refused to do. He would live. on against rule and' precedent; and, at seventeen years of age, was fitted for And entered college, a healthy, robust la d. Some would say that he had more bodily than mental health. The wisest student is he who makes the most of his college advantages, and who begins his cdurse by getting every lesson perfectly, so that every thing o ce passed over he will have ever after at his fingers'-ends. This plan, though it may require some application at first, will enable him to omplete the course with credit, and with less study bestowed on-the prescribed lessons than if he begins-in the usual Way, and only gets each lesson so as to pass for the day. More- over, he will consequently have more time for general read- ing, and will, in all respects, be the gainer. Walter Gomery had this idea so thoroughly inculcated by his excellent father, -that he acted upon it; and hence was so well grounded inthe rudiments of every thing he studied, that the class-lessons - that required the most of the time of others who?pursued a q-]ifferent course, with him occupied but a small portion, But ' he: was regardless of rank, and not always--respectful- to the 'coilege faculty. In fact he was shockingly unorthodox in ci    ..         I    292      GoMERY OF MONTGOMERY: politics and religion, and he read very extensively those, books in the college libraries that were allowed there by rea- -son of their literary merits, though the students were warned not to open them. He would startle his classmates by the boldness of- his suggestions, evincing a scope of thought so far beyond them, that they could neither controvert nor op- pose. Being so entirely self-reliant and original, he was voted an oddity by the students, and of small account: and, though some of the more venturesome looked to him for ideas, it was with fear and trembling even with them; for it exposed them to be rated by the college faculty, and to be suspected by the implicit students. At last his intrusion of unauthorized ideas forced matters to a crisis. The professor -of the ancient languages had preached a famous sermon, entitled "The, Fate of the Ungodly," which he thought so much of, that he had got it published: and this sermon Walter Gomery made the text for a theme, which he jnost diplomatically'and irreverently termed "The Attributes of the Two Great Powers, the Divine and the Diabolical; or, Prof. Hoppin's Theory of Grace'." In this audacious attack of the stripling upon the giant, the parts of the sermon reviewed were those in which the learned professor had proved, to his own satisfaction, the great scheme of creation, sin, and re- demption, according to which, if logically followed out, the' great multitude of mankind were fore-ordained, from the time nihil fit to a miserable eternity, for not believing what their reason told them was not true. He proved too, with equal clearness, that man could do nothing towards averting so awful a doom; and that those who escaped were singled out by divine mercy, and then became saints upon earth until translated to another world. Then the professor lad dwelt at great length on the wickedness of being governed in matters of belief by reason, and proved the great liability of this human attribute to err. They musthelieve, not what reason said was true, but what they, the saints, told them to0 believe, or else they would be cut off, and there would be no hope. Of their own merits they could expect nothing but damnation, and that they deserved for Adam's transgression. But if they accepted all these- ideas, and became orthodox in belief and faith, they then might hope that a dispen-, sation in their favor, which had been ordained from the foun- dation of the world, would be made known to them, and ,\    i ,            ,      Or   A FAMLY HSTORY. ;293  they would receive from the Holy Spirit the assurance of their redemption, and become so purified and changed, that they would rIejoice to behold the torture of those whom in life it Was their duty to love and pity. Ay, so great would be their ecstasy and delight in beholding the misery of others, that they would rejoice, and sing praises and pseans to the author of it; and their' joy would be as great as was that of the saints of old at witnessing a royal auto-da-fe. Having drawn this picture, which was but a mild para- phrase of the professor's sermon, Walter charged upon the :human side of the fortress, and asked who, without denying every attribute of his humanity, every quality that is rightly admired in-men, every-principle and duty taught by Christes words, and illustrated in his life, would-wish to share such a heaven as this? For his part, he would. rather take his lot with the Devil, and stand his chance with him for good or evil; forl with all their abuse and hiogh coloring, they could not make him; out so bad as the God of their vengeance. "Such a heaven," said he, ' if there be such, let those hiave it that can enjoy it, but not me; and, if I never get to it, I shall pity those that do. V      ' I'm wae to think upon yon den, E'en for your sake." This daring assault on the lingual professor was read be- fore the whole class, which would hardly have been allowed had he himself been present. But, as the tutor was not so high in authority as to venture to stop the reading of it, Walter was allowed to read it through; some of the stu- dents evincing a chuckling satisfaction at the well-put thrusts  through the mail of the: professor's logic,:while others looked awe-struck and aghast at the author'stemerity.. After being read, the obnoxious paper was given with oth- ers into the hands of the tutor,;who immediately sent wit :to the professor with an excuse for allowing it to be read, and recommending that most prompt measures be taken to pre- "vent the repetition of such insubordinate heresy. A perusal of the audacious criticism was enough to set the professor in  a,towering passion. -A special meeting of the faculty was called for thAt very evening; and the bffended professor, hav- -ing fortified himself with a substantial repast of hot biscuit, new butter, sponge-cake, and tea, - to which, before setting 26*              ,   29';   '  GOMERY' OF--MONTGOMER1Y: out, he"added a strong glass of brandy and water, ,-Ie ap - peared- at :the board, like Desdemona's father, "full of supper and 'distem'pering' draughts," or, like-the Dutch governor,  '"brimiful' of wrath"- and cabbage,"' and opened the case  with so violent a tirade against the of ending Gomery, as to- -show -that he,was himself a very'proper candidate for the heavien he had depicted. Tihe obnoxious theme- was read; and the professor, so an- gry before, was-even more astonished when he found he was not fully sustained by his brother- professors; and the presi-' dent of the college flatly told him that his sermon, though rhetorically effective, would not bear criticism, and should not have been published. Though the students ought not to. criticisebtheir 'teachers publicly, they had. often experienced the fact, that., if the latter would lay themselves open, the former would take :advantage of every weak and exposed point. The professor insisted that the offender should be ex- pelled.   ,  :"What specific charge would you make?" suggested Pro- fessor Popham, who was the teacher of moral and mental philosophy, and somewhat more tolerant of dissent thau his colleague, Hoppin. "We have never yet, expelled any stu- dent for his religious opinions; and'we have always said we had ho religious test. On the contrary, we have had avowed infidels here, who have graduated, and received the highest honors; and this young man is not an infidel." "He is a great deal worse than an infidel! He is sapping the' very foundation of all evangelical religion. What -in- dubement is there-for being religious or honest, pray, if such ideas are to prevail?"  ' "We will not 'discuss the merits of him who abstains from sin for a selfish consideration," quietly suggested Popham: "'but I don't see that we can interfere in this particular case, unlesswe are prepared to change'our entire policy, and avow that we will receive only those who pass a satisfactory exam-: ination on the cardinal points of religion; and that you: know, and I know, would soon leave the college without stu- dents.

AFAMLY HSTORY.  -      25:  . others not to followtheir example. No, though I amtsome- times accused of Machiavellian tact and policy, I must, say that we have no case against this young man. You can rea- son-with him, Professor Hoppin, and so can others of us; and, having done so, if he persists in his errors, we cannot pre- vent it. Making a public matter of the thing by his expul- , sion would only draw public attention to it; and we must avoid that. Let us do our duty in kindness and charity, and leave the event to a higher power; and, if he be one'of those whom you represent in this sermon as cast out, his fate be upon his own head, not ours." "That is just what he wants. He says in this-very theme he prefers hell to heaven." "But then it is your heaven and your hell, not his," said the president. "You must malke heaven appear mbre at- tractive if you would draw men towards it." The professol; finding himself unsupported, gave up the case for the present, and consoled himself with the idea, that, when the offending student came before him in recitations, he would confound him with unanswerable questions, and give him no marks but those of demerit. It was not long after this that an event happened that served to put him in a still more anomalous position, and to render his college-life any thing but agreeable. He had already seen that he was recgarded with little favor by the faculty. It somehow had leaked out that Prof. Hoppin had attempted to have him expelled; and, though the other members of the fac- ulty had not sustained him, he could see that he was regarded as a wolf in the fold. Some of 'the students, however, could not but admire his temerity; and he was rather a favorite than otherwise of those who made a merit of defying the rules and laws of the college. But, soon after his "mill" with Prof. Hoppin, he so lost the igood will of this class, th'at there was not a student in the college willing to associate' with him; and many of them thought they were doing a good service by smashing his windows of a, dark night. They thought of that afterwards with different feelings. In all our American colleges, there is a sort of class- honor, as -there is among our "Southern brethren " a sort of"  bastard honor, which has nothing to do with and no resema blandce to legitimate honior and integrity. As with the latter it is-no disgrace to swindle-a tradesman by direct- lying,; and  *     s  .           .     .   296      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY: toicheat a landlord or even a washer-woman of money hbcist- ly, hardly earned, while a hint that such acts are not exactly honorable is an offence to be wiped out in blood; so this class- honor exacts of students collectively some things that indi- viduall;y iWould -be accolnteAd mean and despicable. The class- honor, however, is much the better of the two; and, within proper limits, is entirely and altogether commendable. It is righlt to frown upon the mean spirits that would curry favor with the faculty by acting the spy or informner. But when, under that shield, mean and contemptible acts are perpetrated, and injustice and wrong committed, it is cowardly and mean to submit to such tyranny, and bold and noble to face it. Time out of mind it has been thought a noble and dashing thing among students to cut up some mischievous prank on unoffending citizens; and a midnight supper on chickens or turkeys stolen from the poorest people is too often thought an orgy to boast of. It was with this system of college ethics that Walter Gomery came in collision, and in this wise:- A half-mile or more from the college, in a back street, lived several families, all of which were exceeding poor, and almost entirely depended on the wages of the husbands and fathers as day-laborers; to which were added, in some instances, the paltry earnings of the women by washing for the students. But as, in two or three instances, the demon of intemperance had entered the poor habitations, the larger part of the earn- ings of the men was spent for strong drink; and the conse- quence was, that the women were obliged to eke out a meagre support for themselves and children as best they might by cultivating a small garden-patch, raising chickens, ducks, and turkeys, and going out by the day to wash or scrub, or per- form .any severe in-door drudgery required by the wealthiier families of the town. It so chanced thlat this year the scarlet- fever had prevailed in the town, and in this particular neigh- borhood scarce a child had escaped; and, as the Women had necessarily been obliged to give their time and attention to the sickat .home, they had not been able to earn any thing as usual by going out to wash and scrub for their richer neigh- bors. Adrid nlow winter was approachting, and the prospect. was indeed cieerless for these poor people. WalterGomery, who was proie to solitude, had often strayed in his evening walks in this direction, and had sometimes stopped to tatk with the poor women, who seemed to find S relief m telling of   A FAMLY HSTORY.         29? their sorrows. They had the old and weary tale of the drunk- ard's wife: "' The winter was coming on, and their husbands were not saving any of their wages; and, during the sickness of the children, every thing that could be raised had gone to pay for medicines, and such food as the sick must have, or die; and now it is little enough, God knows, the provision they have for the winter. A few potatoes and cabbages, a patch of turnips, and another of corn, that,-in its season, was sadly de- nuded of its roasting-ears by the students, and a stinted pig, were all the family had to depend on to eat during the. long, long winter; and the chickens and turkeys they could sell would barely afford shoes to secure the many feet of the family from the snow; and the children had no warm winter clothes." And with this recital of sorrow the poor woman would usually break down in a gush of tears, and Walter would leave a sad- der if not a wiser man. Sometimes he would leave a trifle on departing; though oftener he would tell a market-nan to take a quarter of lamb or a bushel of corn to them, and not tell who sent it. The college-building in which Walter's room was situated was occupied, for the most part, by the members of his class; ; and the occupants of the room opposite proposed to several of their neighbors to have what they called a " blow-out,' and he was invited to participate. He at first declined; but, when pressed to join by the additional inducement that-the chickens were to be procured by a feat of daring known as robbing hen-roosts, he consented to be one of the party; and, when all had assembled preliminary to sallying forth, he re- monstrated against the intended robbery, and proposed that the chickens Should be honestly bought and paid for, in which case he would stand the whole cost. To this course the others objected, saying "there would be no fun in it in that way." One student said he knew of a place not far off where there were chickens in plenty, and he had found where they roosted, and offered to lead the Spartan band to the booty. But, when Walter learned whose poultry it was that had been signalled out for the feast, he denounced the contemplated robbery; and, to dissuade his cornpanions from it, he related with warmth what he knew of the poverty and affliction of the'peo- pile who would be the sufferers, and said the thing should not ;be dope. : .'"It will.-be done in spite of you,' said Horton, an influea-   -298      GOMERY OF MONTGOMERY, tial member of the class.' We are not to be balked by any of your squeamish notions.,' "Squeamish or not, I say that to rob those poor people would be an unspeakable meanness; and, regardless of re- sults, I will denounce the perpetrators of it to the faculty." - You will bully us, then, Will you, Mr. Tell-tale?" said Hor- ton; and others cried out that he dared not do it, or, if he did, "he should never know another day's peace in that col- lege."            l "I know the consequences," said he, turning, and leaving athe room.  Soon after, he heard them all go, out, an'd in. about an hour return'; and, from the noise kept up till nearly dawn, he had no doubt that the hen-roost had suffered. \ The next morning, when he opened his door, he saw be- fore it some chickens' and turkeys' legs, heads, and feathers, that had evidently been left there by the roysterers as a defi- ance for him to carry his threat into execution if he dared. But, as he was up a good hour before the first morning bell, he thought he would walk down to the place where he sus- pected the robbery had been committed. As be approached the-house, he saw several of the neighbors standing about the door, firom which he suspected that they had come to condole with the family for the loss of their chickens. But not so. -As he approached the house, he observed on the faces of all an expression of sorrow, but none of indignation. A visitor, more unwelcome than any le had suspected, had been there. -The death-angel had passed'during the night, and borne away one of the sick children; and under that load of grief no one had discovered the robbery. Walter said nothing of it, but, placing a five-dollar bill in the hands of the afflicted woman, left without revealing the business that had taken him there. During the morning, he wrote a note to the president, saying that certain students, members of his class, whose names he gave, had been engaged in robbing the hen-roost of a poor family the night before, and that he might be given as authority for the chalrge. Such a letter was without a precedent in that seat of-learn-. ing. What to think of it the good old president-did not know. He could hardly ascribe it to a high conscientious- ness; for :omery wes notoriously a free-thinker, ad, as Hop- *    ,   A FAMLY HSTORY.        299 pin said, worse than an infidel. While pondering over tile grave accusation of so many students by one of their own class, he was interrupted by the entrance of Prof. Hoppin, to whorn he showed the letter. "Gralve charges," said he, reading over the names. "We must take serious action on this business. They must be suspended at least, and the ringleaders expelled." But, just as the word " expelled " fell from his lips, his eyes rested on the name of Gomery. "What! Gomery (Gomery of Montgom- ery, as they call him) making such charges against some of our best students, and those who abhor his abominable doc- trines? Of course, we can take no notice of charges from such a source."    ' "But suppose they are true," mildly suggested the presi- dent: "their nature is not .changed by the character of the complainant." "I think we shall not only encourage a mean spirit of treachery, but shall also be lending our approbation and countenance to a -young man who is\ a perfect snake, and is capable of doing more mischief than all the infidels and row. dies we have had in the college for the last ten years. You have asked my opinion, and I am free to give it: take no no- tice of the letter, and I will take'it on myself that the students shall all know what a vile character is among them. We can, by judicious treatment of the subject, impress the great moral truth, that false ideas and false doctrines inevitably lead to vice and crime." "But not to stealing chickens," meekly interposed the president. Hoppin left the room both pleased and angry,- pleased that Gomnery had committed himslf so against college honor, for his influence would thenceforth be gone;i andia:ngry at the mild rebuke administered to him by the presidt . A few minutes after the departure of H opi ..opham, the professor of mental and moral philosophy,-entered. .,:He was a man very diffeen-t ffrom Hoppin, of less zeal:and more discretion. Hoppin: was dogmatic and overbearhigg, and had the true spirit of' an inquisitor; while Popham was allgentle- ness and persuasion, uniting Maclliavellian wisdomm with the most indulgent charity and benevolence. To him the perr plexed president gave the letter of Gomery; and, when he had read it, he related what had transpired between him anrid Dr. Hoppin. !  ,   '3i00     OMERi Y .OF MONTGOMERY: *'It would be well to investigate the matter somewhat:be- fore making any disturbance about it," said Pof. Popham. ' Leave it to me, and I will find out the merits of the caSe. There must be some cause, founded in spite or pride 4or per- sonal dislike, for such a singular accusation as this. I will 'see , GFomery, and I can probably ascertain what has prompted hiA." He went out, and, returning to his ovn roomlor study, sent for Gomery, who promptly obeyed the summons, but refused to give a word more ofinformation than was contained in the let- ter. The good-natured professor then thought he rould visit the:scene of the depredation, and learn what he could of the robbery from the victims of it. He was not sure which -of the poor families of Poverty Lane, is it was called, had been robbed; but, as he had heard of the death of a child in one of them, he thought he would visit that h6use, and offer such. condolence and consolation as he thought mightt be timely and appropriate, and perhaps le might meet with some one'who would inform him of the raid on the hen-roosts the night before. It was nothing unusual to see Prof. Popham strolling down Poverty Lane. His benevolence had been experienced in that neighborhood often before; and, as he now entered the house of mourning, no one suspected him of a double object,-- of administering Christian consolation, and inquiiing- about their hen-roosts. Such incongruous purposes, nevertheless, were in the good, benevolent, worldly-wise man's mnind. The poor woman, whose child --a little girl of seven -lay a corpse in the room, was in deep grief. She listened, as it'were, with passive indifference to the words of the good man when he told her of the future and better world. No hopes of the ifuture could divert the rmind of the mother from the dread- ful present: the thought that her pretty flaxen-headed Kitty was dead, and must to-morrow be laid away in the grave, was too overpowering to admit of consolation. The good man saw this, and saw that grief must first have way, and that it was not yet time to offer the consolations of religious hope. He therefore abstained from further remarks of that kind, and with great delicacy said that this bereavement must subject them to expenses that they were not prepared to meets and -offered to provide -any thing required. ': Will you not," asked he, "find it difficult 'to provide the graveclothes and coffin for your little girl's fnt "P "   ,.A .FAMLY HSTORY. *,&01 . :; "Oh! you are so kind to us poor people always, Mr. Popham: but there was another good Christian here early in the morn- ing, one of the students; and he left -five dollars, whichfwill pay for the graveclothes. David- Chenery has promised 'to make the coffin for nothing for poor little Kitty; and so the five dollars will pay for all, and make up for the chickens that some bad boys stole last night. While Kitty was dying, they came and stole my chickens-and turkeys." "What,! stole your chickens last night?"  - "Yes: they stole all the best of them, and my biggest, fat- test turkey; and I was expecting to sellthem to buy shoes for George and Richard and Kitty for winter. But now Kitty is dead, and she will never want any shoes again."' And here the poor woman broke down with crying, and sobbed aloud. After waiting for her to compose herself somewhat, the professor asked, ," Do you think any students took your chickens?"      '  j C I am afraid they did."  "Do you think that one had a hand in it who gave you the money this morning? Perhaps he thought he would pay /you for them after having taken them." "Oh, no, sir! it was not him: he is such a good young man!I He has been very kind to us before." ' "Do you know his name?" ( It is Montgomery, or Gomery, or some such name." "Ah, ha!" soliloquized the professor: "this is a phase of student character I have never seen before in my thirty-three years of experience as a teacher." He put the same amount into the woman's hand as had Gomery in the morning,-and returned home " a sadder and a wiser man." The next day he sent for one of the students who- had participated in the stolen feast, telling him- he was very sorry to learn- that certain students had been engaged ..in I a very disreputable transaction,-- one of the very meanest of all.-acts, - the robbing of a poor woman of her chickens, and at a time when she had a sick child dying in her house.  i'A child dyingi" faintly exclaimed the student, turning pale; and then nerving himself for the assault .that was sure to follow.       -  a Do you know any who were of the party?" asked Pop- ha-m with assumed indifference , "No!" said the student indignantly; -"and, if I did, do 26   'l         f -   8302     GOMERY OrF MONTGOMERY: you think I am so nean, so destitute of honor, that I would tell of it?"            '  The professor had not intended that ithe youth should commit himself in a falsehood; but, now that he had done so, he was willinghhe should take the consequences. : He ques- tioned him so closely as to'his whereabouts on the night. in question, as to make him feel that his he was discovered, and then dismissed him. After leaving the profissor's room, the convicted poacher met another of the robbing fiaternity, and related what had passed- between him and "Old Popham," and warned him to be on his guard; "for," said he, " we must all tell the same story, or refuse to answer any thing, and then they can't prove any thing." Directly a meeting of the party was held, and a course of policy determined upon by which to prevent Contradictions and defeat proof. It was ominous to them when they met again that evening at a late hour, and learned that every one who had shared the feast, and none others, had been summoned to the professor's room. The next day they were all called before 'the president, Profs. Pophanm, Hoppin, and the rest of the faculty. They were politely requiested to be seated; and, soon after, Gom- ery -of Montgomery entered. Tley saw at once that denial or evasion would be useless, and were ready to confess every thing. But "Old Pop" was not now disposed to allow them the benefit of a plea of "Guilty." Taking up a letter, he handed it to Gomery, and asked, "Did you write that?"  "Yes, sir."  "You ]have done a very wicked thing, then. You have wrongly accused all these young men; for! they all deny having had any hand or part in this very low and dishonora- ble transaction." "We did not suppose we had a sneaking traitor and in- former among us," said one,'more angry than discreet. "Traitor and informer!" said Walter. "Traitor! Did I betray you? Did I not warn you that the act was wrong-? Did I not refuse to be one of your party so soon as I found it was your purpose to rob a poor ftanily of what was of so much importance to them, and could afford so little pleasure to you? And did I not offer to send out, buy, and pay for every thing you might want, and then warn you, if you per- sisted, I should denounce you? Could' I know of your con-   A P^AMTTY HSTORY.  .   .1 duct, and be silent, without sharing your guilt? I'ha e only done as I said I would, and I have no more to' say." If your act is defensible, defend it; but don't think to skulk behind my unpopularity to,save yourselves. What! keep me silent over such an act as this? Make me wink at such a meanness? (for I will not dignify it by calling it a crime.") With this burst of indignation, he arose, and left the room. The students denied nothing more. Hoppin sought to palliate their conduct by telling them to be cautious, and avoid the society of young men who had neither evangelical religion nor a proper sense of honor. But the students were all sharply reprimanded by the president. Each one- was required to make a written confession; and each was to go to the house of the poor woman, and leave with her a sum of money equal to the entire value of the purloined poultry. This was the penalty imposed; and the alternative of refusal was to be immediate and unconditional expulsion. To these conditions they all promised to submit, when they were al- lowed to withdraw          -  "I trust,)" said Hoppin, after the door was closed, "that- those who have exercised this severity are prepared to bear the responsibility of their acts." '   --  "What less could we do, if we would maintain ally disci- pline in the college?" replied Popham. "I don't object to the punishment in itself; but I do object to giving any heed or respect to such a cast-away as Gomery."  , "But the others'confessed."            ' s"That does not matter. By sustaining him, we aim a blow at vital, evangelical religion." "On the contrary, I think we aim a blow at chicken-steal- ing, and knavery in general." -The matter was here allowed to drop by the -faculty, but not so by the students. The affair was bruited through the college; and the version given of it by the six, anid by the amiable Hoppin, was such as to set the whole current of public sentiment of the college against Gomery. He knew that he was suffering injustice at their hands, but took no pains to correct the misapprehension. If he heard cat-calls near his room, or was startled by a brick-bat crashing .his window, he made no complaint,-not even allowing the damages to be repaired, as is usual, at the common cost of , '   304      G ooMERY OF MONTGOMEBRY.  the students, but paying for all out of his own pocke; .It will be all right," said he to himself, "some day; and it is not for me to doubt that final justice will be done. Thereis a God in the earth." Popham knew of this injustice and wrong that Gomery was receiving from the hands of his fellow-students, and he mighteasily have stopped it. But Popham always went abiroad in silver slippers, even on errands of mercy; and the slippers would have been tarnished by following the path of Walter Gomery. In time, however, the persecution on account of this act abated; and, as his character became better understood, he grew into favor, and was thought to be, though radical and erratic, one of the best fellows in the college; though some, insisted that his adherence to his own sense of right, in defi- ance of the established laws of college-honor, was a dark blot on his character. But thus he had been constituted by his Creator. It was not possible for him to see glory, except hand in hand with duty; and it would seem, from some of the ideas and opinions advanced by him, that he would hot shrink from infamy if he could see in it the way to others' good. To be infamous before the world, and know that in- famy must' follow him through life and. after -death! And for what? To benefit those Who will stigmatize his name, and teach their children to abhor it. What a character! But in time his position, opinions, and his boldness in avowing them, commanded so much respect, that, before he graduated, he grew into more'influence than any other stu- 'dent. His audacity in attacking opinions arid ideas that /t were so generally received as never to be questioned by others caused someiof the more timid and worshipful to fear him as no better -than he should be. But his good nature and his unselfish disposition won upon the hearts of even these; and in charity they ascribed his radical eccentric ideas to a sort of mental deformity.  Though his peculiar opinions were hard to combat, yet they were so at valiance with the popular and received ideas of the time, that it' was unwise for him to advance them. He could do little good to others by it, but did himself much harm. Yet it was in him to oppose'error, or what seemed to him error; and he could not allow it to pass unchal- lenged, because to expose or assail it would expose him i? i r' ,          I. * \   A FAMLY HSTOBY.        )5 obloquy. Hence, during the last year of his college course, during which he had much leisure, he set his fellow-students  by the ears by throwing among them apples of discord in: the shape of startling propositions; so that the professors were far more liable to overhear the students criticising, rather tlian extolling, the doctrines taught them. The piofessors wished him away; for they regarded his influence as noxious and innovating. But le remained to graduate, and left the college with'few honors, and on the part of the faculty with no regrets, except that he had lever been one of its students. They did not consider it creditable to the college that a young man should leave its walls, after a four-years' course, with such capacity to do harm as he had shown in getting his dangerous opinions diffused all through the college. That he had helped several poor students over theirterm-bills was not known till after he had graduated; nor was it suspected 'that his rigid economy was practical, that he might save from his own liberal allowance a sum to enable others to complete the course. After leaving the college, Walter returned to his old home at the Pivot, and commenced reading the elementary books on law in his father's office. He was inclined to re- main at home rather than enter an office in a large city; for the reason that Hester Homer; now grown to a beautiful- girl of sixteen, was in the neighborhood. During his- college course, he had frequently written to herand had induced her, after much persuasion, to answer his letters. At first they were timid, reserved, and childish; but, in time she" learned to write more freely, and :to tell him of things he cared to know. He would ask her to write of the most every-day occurrences, the eventsi"of the village, and the lit' tle incidents of her own quiet, humble life. With this in- duceement, and with such a friend to counsel her, and advise her of her errors in orthography or expression, she soon found it an easy task to fill whole pages, even when, on sit- ting down to write, she felt that she had nothing to say-. Walter was now known by most people as Gomery of Montgomery. He had been -so called while in college; and after his returrn he was called -so by the people of the vil- lage, in- contradistinction to his father, who was called tie Squire, or Square as the villagers most generally pro- lnounced it. , 26*'   306:,      GOMEERY OF MONTGOMERY: CHAPTER     XXTTT. "How bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man9J eyes' " --As You LIKE IT.  GREAT changes have taken place in the Gomery Family during the time that Walter has been pursuing his studies and bothering professors at college. On his final return, he was the only one of the children who had not left the pater- nal roof, never, in all probability, to return to it except as a trahsient visitor. His elder sister, Juliet, had, while he was yet a freshman, married in Philadelphia a man twice her age, -a gentleman famous as a lawyer and statesman throu gh- out the whole country, and, at the time of her marriage, just elected a senator in Congress. His brother Theron had- married ,the: daughter of Jacob Pickering, President of: the Security'Bank his only child, and heiress to nobody knew how much money. He had taken a house in the most ex- clusive and fashionable part of the city, and was living in great splendor, a- his sister Rose, who had gone soon after  the marriage to' visit them, ,had written home. She had spent the winter in New York, intending, when she left, the Pivot, to go on to Philadelphia in the spring; but this plan- was: frustrated, as might have been foreseen. A man who had never seen her was lying in wait for her to come.?This: was Jenks, who will be remembered as the particular friend of Theron' during his apprenticeship at the Bullion o , He hadseen the elder sister, andhad known Theron so well, -and, had formed so favorable an opinion of the whole family, that he fanied himself in love with Rose even before he saw her., It is certain he was-ioon after; and she did not reject his: attentions, but on the contrary, to the great joy of, her brother, reciprocated his love with that ardor peculiar to 'her' enthusiastic and earnest nature. She therefore returned in thae spring to her hoae to pass those hopeful yet melancholy months -that precede that important event which :removes   A FAMLY HSTORY.        307: the loved and loving daughter from the fond home of her childhood. Thither she was followed, a few months later, by the devoted Jenks, who bore back to- his home in New York as fair a bride as ever breathed the mountain air of New England. The career of Wirtimir in Philadelphia had been nearly as successful as that of his elder brother; as, having been promoted to a partnership with his uncle, he was already on the high road to fortune. This unparalleled success of the children caused,.more gratification than surprise to Freeborn Gomery and his wife. She was not surprised at all; indeed, she was not quite satis- fied. As we said long ago, she was conscious of a something in- lber children that would give them a leading position in the world. If it were so, as was said by certain envious per- ' sons long before, that she- mugt .have married Gomery of Montgomery on physiological principles, the result would go to- show that such matches were' not always unwise. And yet she was not satisfied. Though her elder sons were on the road to wealth and fortune, she hoped to see one of her children distinguished for something more than a capacity to- make money, or take a lead in society for a day, and then be superseded and forgotten, leaving no honored name to pos- terity. Had- she not rejected a young man of immense wealth to accept the comparatively poor Gomery of Mont. gomery? and did her sons promise any more or better than the man whom she thought unworthy of her hand? - Had- she not, in her days of courtship, despised Thomas Fogue, when she compared him with her own accepted suitor? and did her sons, Theron and Wirtimir, promise to be like him, whom no woman of equal character and discimiination with herself could love or respect? Such were the thoughts that passed through the mind of this wisely ambitious woman. She hoped to see one of her sons famous, and she fancied she saw in Walter the germs of originality and independent thought that would develop into intellectual greatness. In him were the hopes of her mature years centred, and in his struggles and successes she expected to find the excitements and delights - of a wel- spent life for her declining years.         l The neighbors of Mrs. Gomery supposed her later life - must t-be that of unalloyed happiness; and, ifshe was not con- rent- when so highly: blessedi,. Ifear the -charge would: lie f ntwhen' s  -hg l* - '       -I   308      GO:MEY OP MONTGOMERY : i against her of possessing an ungrateful and rebellious heart. But her life had been one of such constant happiness, in spite of the small disappointments I have mentioned, her ways had fallen in stlch pleasant places, that the best 'traits of- her character had never been revealed. The most envious of her neighbors, however, were destined to, see her subjected to trials such as their worst malignity or most grudging envy had never desired to witness, and to see her rise above them, so resigned and so grand, that the most bigoted of her -accusers should feel humbled before her. But when one after another of the' young Gomerys had left their native place, and the news had come back to Mont- gomery Village of the success they had met with, the ambi- tion of other village swains was fired, so that they, too, must set off to try their: fortunes abroad. They had never, as boys, recognized themselves as inferior to the youngs Gomerys; and not only were there several who could outrun, duthox, and outwrestle them, but as for dancing, half the fellows in the village could outwing and outshuffle! them. It was true, they had always been more forward in their studies; but that was only because they' had been made to study at home under parental tuition, while the others were hanging about the shops and stores, skating on the ponds, or snowhalling in the streets. "If the Gomnerys could do so well abroad, then why could not they?"' reasoned these Ihopeful youths. And parents and sisters encouraged them in their ambitious hopes ,and schemes; the latter imagining, that, if their brothers * would only venture forth, they, too, would somehow soon fol- low them to-the large cities, there to become, like Juliet-and Rose Gomery, the wives of" rich merchants and- bankerS. With such encouragement, some' half a dozen young men: i. Montgomery Village resolved to give up the vulgar, hard labor of farming, tending saw-mills, and house-carpentering, and go forth to fields more worthy of their talents and ambi- tion. Of the six who thus left, the next autumn found three of themn back to, Montgomery: and these had been obliged to hire out for the season as lighterers and farm-hands, instead of being sought for, as they had anticipated, to take the managemen of extensive mercantile -houses. Of the other three, the One most sprightly and intelligent took to evil courses, and never returned another shipped as a green hand before the' mast; and the last hired out as a drayman, and,    t:   .  .A FASMLY HSTORY.- --       309 after a few months, bought a dray and horse for himself, and with that made money so fast, that he soon bought other drays and horses, and hired men, and, in a few years, was able to return to his native village, and boast of ten-thousand dollars invested in real estate in New York, and of drays and horses besides, that were bringing in to him two thousand dollars a year more, clear profit. The sailor, whose name was Peter Dykes, we shall meet with again in the course of this history. The failure of those other young men who left Montgom. ery to achieve any success corresponding to that of the young Gomerys caused people to have more respect and awe than ever for Freeborn Gomery and his proud and still beautiful wife. The neighboring women thought it very strange that she never evinced surprise or gratitude at their unparal- leled good fortune. Her self-complacency, her manner of accepting it all as a matter of course, was exceedingly amaz- ing to them; for though she had not said, it in words since the time of the great ball, when she had so furiously rebuked the wife of Tom Homer for imagining, that, with all the art of Joe Pumpagin, she could mistake any other child for a Gomery, yet did her whole manner say, "There-is nothing strange about it at all. It is the most natural thing in the world. The children of Freeborn Gomery and Jane- Mackenzie are to be judged by no common test. They were born to prosper and lead. There was a harmony of health, bodilyand mental, that goave them to the world,- adapted and fitted for it. In their case, Nature's laws have been observed: a healthy parentage on both- sides has produced a healthy- stock, fitted for the healthy world in which it is to play its part." ,  END Or VOL.
