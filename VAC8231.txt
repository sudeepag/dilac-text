CHAPTER I. -
T   HE, sun was shedding its burn-
ing rays on the beautiful lake,
of Lucerne, burnishing the windows
of the hotel which overlook it, and
gilding the golden hair of a young
girl who stood leaning against the
casement of a. room on the first floor,
just behind one of the transparent
curtains that shaded her from the
view of those without, but allowed
her to see fully all that was passing
in the garden beneath.    She was
dressed in a soft white muslin, of
which she seemed almost a part, so
evanescent and fair was she to look
at. She was not strictly beautiful,
but as she stood' there, almost mo-
tionless, her hair coiled around her
delicate head in rich braids, which
drooped into her white throat behind,
her deep blue eyes fixed dreamily on
the road that theyseemed to be fol-
lowing with sad intensity, her frail
figure so full of grace, her lips parted
slightly, as if to let a sigh escape,
which would no longer be. impris-
oned by her heart, she was a picture
worthy of Greuze's pencil. There
was a lovely look of maidenhood about
her, whichhe would gladly, stretch-
ing out his hand to stop the swift
race of time, have fixed forever on
his canvas.
1

Gay laughter floated up to the
window; young women, flirting with
young men, were papsing on; she saw
the little boats gliding to and fro, from
the miniature dock at the foot,'of the
hotel. Just at this moment a young
couple came through the'porch; sev-
eral gentlemen touched their hats to
them. Ina bent forward, forgetting
herself for the first. time, and, leaning
slightly out of the window, listened
breathlessly to catch their words.
The gentleman spoke in German; the
young lady answered him in the same
language, yet she did not appear to
be of that race, although her accent
was so pure. She was earnest in her
manner, with a smile on her lips, but
an expression of melancholy in her
eyes. Ina heard her say, "Mamma
was married in the year -"; she did
not catch the date. "Papa loved her
so much." The gentleman yawned,
and looked generally bored. " Papa
died -"; again she did not hear the
date, but she saw the lady look sad-
der, and then a sweet little bird flew
down at her feet, and stood in front
of her, turning its pretty head, and
making little skips on the sand, leav-
ing a print as* of flowers behind it
wherever it rested, seeming to say,
as it glanced- up at the lady and co-
quetted with the strong earth, "I care
not who you are, God made me too,"

and then, as if afraidof its own tin
insolence, it spread its wings an
flew away through the air. Ina say
the lady look after it with a yearnin
glance, and then she heard her say i
perfect English, "0 pretty bird !
She turned laughingly to the gentle
man at her side, who looked as if th
only interest the. little bird coul
have for him would be to see i
nicely cooked, and said, "Lieber Vo
gel, fliege weiter, nimm ein kusz mit
und ein -  *  They passed on. In
smiled faintly, and added, "Grusz.
She watched the lady as her viole
muslin disappeared amongst the trees
she thought it shed back"a perfum
of its own color, and said td herself
"I should not like it if he ever looked
so indifferently on me "; she shud
dered slightly and added, "I should
,die!"  Two young ladies had also
stopped to watch this couple who
had excited such an interest iuIna
One of the girls said to the other,
"She is dressed like anybody else !
" What makes you think it is she ?"
said the other. " 0, I know it is,
they said so; but when she lifted her
gown, I knew she was the English
Princess with her German bridegroom
because her petticoat was a long train
of white silk !"
"Die- wahre Primzessin," t thought
Ina to herself. "It is Hans Andersen's
own story of the green pea under her
mattress again !  So that was the
Princess. I thought in her young
rounded face there was something
that was different from all the rest!
She too is on her wedding tour. Do

thee, and a - greeting."

.y all men look so after marriage? le
.d did not seem glad at all." A slight
w shudder passed again over her deli-
g cate frame, a cloud rested a nomenlt
n on her brow, just as when a bird flies
between you and the sun, and she
- repeated: "I should die ; life seems
e to me now as if I were to hear always
d the soft waters of a rivulet running
t over my heart as that does over the
- snow-white pe bles that lie in it; as
b, if I were ever to be flooded by the
a warm rays of the sun, with the fra-
grance of wild Eastern flowers filling
t my senses, and the music of love
sounding through everything, his eyes
e ever bent on mine, so that I feel they
are resting there, but cannot raise
I mine to meet them."
- , The color faintly rose in her cheeks
I as she said these words to herself,
and then deepened, until it covered
her whole face and brow ; it faded
. away as it came, and she leaned for-
ward again, impatiently gazing into
the long distance of road before her.
A loud knock was just.then heard at
her door ; she started, hastily crossed
the room, sat down in an arm-chair
that was near the table, and, taking a
book in. her hand, called out as
quietly as she could " Entrez !" A.
servant put in his head, and said,
" C'est l'heure du diner. Est-ce que
Madame va descendre ? "
"Non,"   she   answered, hesitat-
ingly.-'
The servant looked at her with a
sort of stupid curiosity.  "Est-ce que
Mademoiselle vent diner dans sa
chambre("
"Non ie answered, rather haugh-
tily. .The servant shut the door,
mumbling something to himself:, and

was alone again. She began to t]
swalk the room nervously, her cheeks a
burned, and her hands were cold as n
icred, "What shall I do ?" she said.
"I am so alone, I begin to feel fright- h
c am d;and she began to cry, but n
she wiped away the tears,'and sat t
down, and tried to read. It was an a
English book, and the first thing her s
eyes fell on was this line, " Thus, as h
in Burger's poem those words, 'Bei n
ni, bei ihin ist Seligkeit, und ohne ii
Wilhelm Hllle'-"*she did not read
any farther. "Ah, that is true!" she I
murmured ; "when will he come ?" h
and she resumed her weary walk up r
and down the parlor, stopping every
time to look longingly out of there
window.
The garden was quite desolate
now, and the sun was beginning to t
go down. It had been trying to look
into the lake, made dusky by those
dark mountains, like a beautiful eye
by its long fringe of lashes, and, baf-
fled and angry, it was disappearing
now, blood-red, as if chafed with dis-
appointment, behind those very barri-
ers to its happiness. The lake looked
dull, as if it too did not like being
left by its hot, inpo : unate lover, and
Ina saw the Princess coming slowly
back from her walk. She too had
Saxon hair and blue eyes ; she looked
pale. Her liege lord was flushed with
his walk. They came nearer. The
Prince looked up, and so did the
Princess ; she smiled, and he said
with a yawn, " Schdnes Mdchen,
sie kdnnte deine Sechwester sein." t
Ina drew back, blushing, behind
* "Near him, near him is blessedness, and
t Bautifu 1maiden, she mighitbe thy sister.".

he curtain, but she heard the lady
nswer, in English, "She looks Ger-
nan, and might understand you."
"What difference does that make ?"
le answered in German. " Every wo-
man likes to hear herself called beau-
iful"; and so their voices died away,
nd Ina was alone again. " Better,"
he said, in her fever of anxiety, "-to
lave him even cold and indifferent
ear her than to be all alone ; she
s far happier than I !"
The sun sank slowly away, and
na, weary of looking out, weary of
herself and of life, sit d6wn to see if
not watching would not bring him.
Twilight stole into the room, the
moon rose, and now her feelings grew
almost unbearable ; she rang the bell;
a'man-servant answered it. "Send
th'e maid," she said. The man was
gone about five minutes, there was a
great ringing of bells, and then the
.maid appeared.
"DQes Madame wish me?"
"Yes; has the last train arrived?"
"No, there is one arrives at nine.
Madame has been all day without
eating. Is Madame expecting a
friend?"
"Yes ; are you married ?"
lhe girl drew herself lap, as if the
mere suggestion were deleterious to
the purity of her life, and answered-
shortly, " Not I, Madame; is Madame
or Mademoiselle married ?"
"No," answered Ina, in her turn
shortly, and coloring in spite of her-
self.
" Then Mademoiselle is expecting
her father ?"
" Are you happy here ?" said Ina,

many questions, yet hoping that she

pointment we had, that I was -sudden-
ly taken ill, and I was off, an hour
after, in the train which leaves Turin
for Milan."
"Will they not be angry ?" she
said timidly. "Was it right ? "
"As for their anger, they may cool
it by the first northern wind that
blows,- I wish it would come from
America, and dissipate all their mis-
erable mists; and as for right, right
is wrong, and wrong is right, accord-
ingly as you let the light strike on it,
-your hair is ahnos't dark now, and
a few moments ago it was like the
sun's own beams."
"Yes; but then its color is not
really changed, and so right is always
right, and wrong is wrong."
"The only rights that I acknowl-
edge are those of love," he said, kiss-
ing her hair, for her face was still
hidden; " the only wrong, to turn
your back on a beautiful woman."
" Hush !" - putting her little hand
over his mouth, and turning her face
for the first time up to his,-" I am
jealous, jealous as Rosmunda. I too
would kill my rival," she said, with a
sudden lightning in his blue sky.
"If you knew," he said, fixing his
dark eyes on her with admiration,
"how much I love you when you
speak and look thus."
"Do you not love me always the
same?" she said, with a faltering
tone of wonder in her voice.
"Always the same," he answered;
"but all the more when your Ger-
man snow is lit up by our Italian sun ;
then it dazzles like the Jungfrau,
it is all it needs, a constant sunset."
"Do not say so," she said, clinging

to him. "You mean that I should al-
ways need its parting rays, which are
those of sorrow, to make me glow
with color enough for your Southern
eyes ; that for you I shall give out
sweetest music only when you are
leaving me, like Egypt's statue. God
forbid !"
A knock at the door made her
bound from the place where she was
like a deer that hears the bugle-horn,
and she stood near the table,. with
her head thrown back, in very much
the same attitude as this graceful
animal when it is listening with a
mixture of pride and defiance to the
approaching step of its pursuer.
Her lover looked at her, as she
stood there, as if he were drinking in
her beautiful form with every sense,
and then, turning quietly to the door,
said in a commanding voice, "Entrez!"
A servant opened the door to ask
where he should put Monsieur's trunk.
"Bring it in here," he answered.
She spoke quickly in Italian in a
low voice, coloring up to her tem-
ples: "No, not here ; these are my
rooms."
He turned sternly to- the waiter,
and saying "Find a room for me
where you can" came back to where
she stood; he said in quick, almost
mocking tones, t "Are you not my   4
wife ?"
"Not yet," she answered distinctly,
very pale now, but throwing back her
head, and looking him proudly in'the
face. Then coming up to him, and
putting her arms around his neck,
she said coaxingly, " Are you not
tired ? Will you not eat something?"
"hnhave you eaten ?" he said,
turning quickly to look at her.

+ "My soul."

"Not all day," she answered, laugh
ing. " How could I eat when I was ii
such a fever of anxiety? it would
have choked me."
" Foolish child," he said, lookingat
her with tender anxiety, "you will
eat now." He rang the bell and or-
dered supper in their parlor,-cold
chicken, anything they had. The
table was soon prepared, and Ina
took her place at the head, and be-
gan helping him to the cold meat.
"I have dined," he said.
" Yes ; but'you will -not refuse to
eat with mhe,jus for company's sake,"
she said, holdi g out a wing of the
chicken on he , own fork, and look-
ing winninglyfp at him. Emanuele
.Bertani was a tall man, with dark
eyes,- which  1en not interested in
what was before him, were indiffer-
ent, ordinary black eyes, when roused
to life by the subject or object that
for the moment absorbed him, were
full of flakes of light, -- they glowed,
they 'fired like a grand war-horse.
His brow was handsome, his features
good, his hair fell in large dark waves
over his really grand forehead, and it
seemed as if the same peculiar light
glanced in his teeth,his hair, and his
eyes. He was somewhat massive in
form, and as he sat there beside that
delicate fair woman, he." looked so
powerful, she so fragile, that you
could not but trust that he would-
use the greater strength that nature
had given him gently, for her sake.
"I feed on your beauty," he said. .
"You do not look," she answered
archly, " as if that were your only
diet. Do you not feel, as Byron did,
that a we man loses all her charms if
she has an appetite ? If I did not

-'think it would be so, I would eat, for
n I am very faint for want of food ; but
1 you must do something, you must
light a cigar."
t   "Do you not mind the smoke ?"
l "Not if they are not Cavours. I
- own that, although half Italian."
"You!" he said, with an amused
smile.
"Yes, I, all but the coloring."
" Of your nature ?"
"No, -you are very impertinent,
- of my hair and eyes. You do not
let me say half I want to. I suppose
you think that a little thing like me
must tremble before you as a states-
man, but am I not to be at least Bru-
tus's wife, if not Cato's daughter ?
Then half your mantle will fall over
me, and it will be enough to cover
me all."
The smoke of his cigar is curling
up over his head and making a/veil
of mist between them, his head is
leaning back against the chair, his
eyes half closed, and he is looking
under them fixedly at her._
"When is it to be ? - very early
to-morrow morning    hes
The blood has rushed to her neck
and  brow, even   her hands are
blushing ; it seems as if her color
tinged with a. roseate hue the smoke
that lay between them.
"When you will," she answers, her
eyelids suddenly drooping heavily
over her eyes, as if she could not
raise them again.
"I will to-morrow morning," he
says- with determination, "before the
earth has reddened under the sun's
glance half as deeply as you did just
now."
" You are my master," she an-

swered; "to hear is to obey ! Is not
tlt the tiway in Italy ? "- her eyes
.still shaded by her long lashes.
"Look up at me ; there is so much
trust in your eyes."
* " Not now, I cannot."
. "Will you to-morrow ?"
"Yes," she says, blushing, " if you
do not look at me too earnestly. I
am half afraid of you, yet I might
say with Ii)esdeiona, 'why I should
fear I know not --'"  She hesitated.
"I must not finish the line."
"Why not ?"
"I fear I canpt say 'since guilti-
ness I know not, for I have deeply
deceived the best of friends," she
adds, with a deep sigh.           -
"To-morrow ; why do you look at
your watch ?"
"Because," she said, with a fright-
ened look, "it is very late, the hotel
is all still, you must go."
"Not yet!" ie said, with a look of
passionate entreaty.
"Yes,"she answered; "good night."
He has caught her in his arms,
and before she has time to loosen his
hold, has pressed his lips to her eyes
and lips. " Good night, mia bella,
anima mia!" *
CHAPTER II.
T HE next morning Ina was waked
at an early hour by the well-
lown rap of her impatient lover;
she had just fallen asleep, after a
restless few hours of tossing to and
fro since Ire left her. She called out
laughingly : "I cannot come'yet, you
must wait."
* My beautiful one, my soul!t

"Open the door a little way," he
answers in a low voice.
She has sprung from    the bed,
thrown on her white-flannel dressing-
gown, and, hiding herself well behind
the door, opens it a tiny crack.
"I will go out to arrange matters,
and will be back in half an hour."
"Stay an hour !"   she answers,
blushing bellind the door.
"Very well, I give you an hour.
Addio."
" Addio," and she shuts the door
and locks it again. Ina begins with
tremulous hand to bi'ush out. her
long locks, and coil them around her
small head ; then she begins her toi-
let, and washes and dresses with a
sort of nervous haste, thinking all the
time: "I am alone, nobody dreams
that I am here ; yet I am happy, 0,
so happy r I feel just like a bird, as
if I could fill the whole world with
my song, as if I had wings and must
soar above the earth. It makes me
sad to think that everybody is not so
happy as I. I wish the Prince had
not such vapid eyes, they look as if
they could only reflect roast-beef;
and the poor Princess - hers seemed
just fitted to mirror forth the stars,
jasmines, blue violets, and pansies.
I wonder why we must die, why we
cannot always live with love in our
hearts, and this' exquisite atmbs-
phere of happiness~breathing around
us like Persian roses. Ai.t" she
said, with a short sigh of rapture,
"perhaps it would be too much !"

in tile sweetness of tile morning air ;
sihe looked down the road once
more, and then at her watchl; the
hour was just passed, and she

began to feel a little nervous sen-
sation steal over her again, when she
looked down, and saw her lover
standing just under the window where
she was. He was gazing up at her
with earnestness, and love in his
eyes. . She let drop a flower that she
held in her hand; he caught it, and
said, "Will you come down? he is
waiting for us."
"Who?" she said, trembling a lit-
tle, and turning pale. "I will come.
Wait there for me.",
With hurried hands she put on her
little round hat, and hastened down
stairs.        .
" How divinely you look !" he said,
as he drew her arm tenderly under
his. " Your dress is like one of your
own Heine's poems, full of suggestions
which are born on the earth and die
in the clouds."
"Do you like it ? " she said, look-
ing up at him. " I never am satisfied
with anything I wear until I know
that it has pleased you !"
Her dress was a transparent white
muslin, covered With wreaths of large
dark violets, so true to nature that
they seemed as if they were pressed
upon it; a long white feather in her
round hat, fastened with a bunch of
the same flowers, completed her
toilet.
"Women are blamed," he said,
"for thinking too much of dress, but
men forget that they are but artists,
painting pictures continually for us ;
it is a living gallery, better than any
that the Pitti Palace can furnish for
us."
*" Ah yes!I" she answered; " but
~Sir Joshua Reynolds tells us that
if all the time, taste, and thought that

we expend on our toilet were devoted
to some artistic object, we might be-
come remarkable as painters or sculp-
tors, - would not that be better ?"
"To me," he answered, "the idea
is merely insupportable of women's
becoming anything save the lovely.
idols they are now of men,"
" Ah," she said, crimsoning, "do
not say so! I think it is terrible
for women to be - to be as the Ital-
ian women are generally, with no
minds save for th6 petty life of every
day, with no souls save for the pass-
ing pleasures of the moment."
"You pass unscathed," he said,
"by my resentment for my country-
women, as a flower does before the
thunder, merely because you look so
lovely when you reason."
" I would rather it were," she an-
swered, laughing, "because my rea-
son convinces you."
" If there is to' me a thing in life
that is detestable, 'it is the new
American doctrine, which will solve
the great problem of the end of the

Would you like best, my love, to
become a preacher from the pulpit,
or a surgeon ? " he said, looking
down fondly at her little hands.
"I should like to become," she
said earnestly, "a true, woman, a
fit companion for you, so that I
should understand all that you did,
and could help you, and live thus
doubly for and with you !"
"Do not forget," he said thought-
fully, "that Sappho lost her lover;
if woman lost her dolce abatndono,*
she would lose all her charms for
men."
* sweet abandonment. .

Ina dared not press the subject
any further, for she knew well that
she could play like a child with her
lover's gentler moods, but that she
must not anger him.
They had been walking in a shady
path, which now   suddenly opened
into- the broad road,,and there, right
before them, stood the lovely church
of Lucerne, where the organ peals
out with such power, and then sud-
denly, as if a choir of angels were
answering it in the distance, you
hear the veiled voices of young ne-
ophytes, that seem to be following
the music and playing with it, and
filling it with a flood of harmony
now it rumbles along the walls, and
presses against them, as if it would
burst away from the narrow place
where it is imprisoned and flood the
whole air and earth with melody ;
now it seems as if it were all with-
out, coming down from the sky and
seeking admittance just there within
that hallowed precinct. All was
still now. Ina trembled, and drew
nearer to her protector. The door
stood half open, and a sleepy-looking
sexton was on the steps, apparently
watching for the approaching couple.I
Emnanuele pressed her arm closer'
and closer to his heart, as if he
would give her fresh courage, and I
they passed into the vestibule, up
the aisle, towards the altar, where
a Protestant clergyman was await-
ing themr. Ina dropped down on
her knees when she reached the last
step, and the service. had already i
begun. When the minister came to
the place " With this ring I thee
wed," he paused a moment, and put I
out his hand for the ring. Signor I

Bertani looked embarrassed ; he had
none with him. Ina quickly slipped
off one of her own, and, giving it to
the clergyman, it was replaced by
her bridegroom on the fourth finger
of her left hand ; she could not help
smiling through her tears when she
saw it there, her own ring. The
ceremony was soon over ; there had
been no one to give away the bride,
there were no friends to turn to, no
mother in whose arms to be received
The clergyman was a venerable-
looking old man. He seemed to feel
Ina's loneliness, as she turned away
with a choking sound in her throat,
and he said solemnly, " God bless
you, my daughter."
"Thank you," she said, "father,"
and stretched out her hand to him.
He held it in his a moment, looking
into her young fresh face as if he
would gladly read her future there ;
as well might he look into the, petals
of a fair flower to find the reflection
of the storm that is to scatter its
leaves to the wind.
Emanuele Bertani drew her other
hand hastily again under his arm,
and, handing to the old father a
heavy envelope, he hurried down the
lonely aisle with his Ina. " You are
my wife now," he whispered in low,
impassioned accents, "my own, my
beautiful Ina. No one can rob me of
you now ; your sweets are all mine,
not even Marcello can approach you
now."
Ina blushed and, looked fully up
nto his eyes;'yesterday she could
not look him so in the face ; it was a
wife's trusting gaze, as if she said, " I
fear not you, nor the whole world
beside, now." The tears were still

had settled upon when he had been under her soft tread, whose tears of

at Lucerne before. It was very small,
all, covered with vines, like a little
nest in the green trees. In the door
stood a cheerful-looking young wo-
man with blue eyes and golden hair
too. Ina wished, as she looked at
her, that her own were dark ; light
hair seems so common, she thought,
in this country. Bertani had known
this woman in Florence, and he had
sent her here to make ready all
things for them.
"You are very.welcome, Madame,"
she said to Ina in broken Italian.
" Thank you," said Ina. " It is a
sweet little home," she said, turning
to her husband, "and I like the looks
of my little maid."
" You will like her, I am sure ; she
is one of the most remarkable crea-
tures I ever knew. I knew her first
husband well."   '
"Has she had two husbands' so
y.said Ina. "That is one too
many."              ...
They sat down on the porch to-
gether.

repentance are false as French dia-
monds, whose courage is to hide
herself behind the cuirass of her
conquerors, whose strength is that of
a  Delilah, treachery   to  her own
heroes ; she lures them to her beau-
tiful arms, and then, when they sleep
in security and trust, she cuts away
their hopes and their power ; she.
holds the glittering knife red with
her own blood in her hands, and
laughs at its ruby drops ; she goes to
the  market-place   of nations, and,
stripping herself, shows those scars
which she ought to blush to wear !
Live for her ! No! save that through
her I may live for myself!" As he
spoke thus, his breath came quick,
his white teeth were clenched, but
his eyes had none of the light in them
that Ina's so - often shrank before ;
they were cold and lustreless. He
spoke with warmth, but there was
no fire in his face. Ina looked at
him with a strand feeling of awe,
almost pity.
"Then die for it !" she said with

10

sudden energy, leaving 1his side, and
standing with flushing cheeks look-
lug at him.
"You seem inspired, as if you were
a second Joan d'Arc," he said. "I
would willingly be the English gen-
eral, and leave my country foi your
love at any moment."
"If you would do that, you would
leave me as easily for another love.
I would rather be Clorinda, and, dy-
iug, be baptized with your faith;
that would be sweet :" she said, with
a bright smile lighing her whole
face.
"I 'would rather you were Armida,
not coming for the battle-field nor
heeding the dust of life, only leading
nie on and on, by the light of your
beautiful eyes, into the green mead-
ows of pleasure, through the spark-
ling waves of passionunto the banks
of love and -lesire. Come, put off
your helmet and your shield, and tell
ie all I most want to know, -how
you left Turin, what the Benonis
thought of your sudden decision. I
did not see them after you left. I
avoided going there purposely."
Ina took a seat a little way from
him.
"No, not there," he said; -' you look
like a soft cloud= that is just sailing
away. I must ever touch you to
know that you are palpable."
"I will come," shaid, laughing,
"and settle on Ary mountain's top, and
throw it all iii the shadow if I can."
She came and stood near him, leaning
her arms on his shoulder, and run-
ning her fingers through his dark
-hair.                          .
" How black your hair is.!" she
said. "It looks as if time never would

steal into it,. and pay its silver price
for all these beautiful locks."
"It would be more unwarrantable
if he robbed you of your gold," he
said. " I am glad we did not live when
the old masters did, for Raphael
might have died of love for you, in-
stead of the Fornarina; or Titian per-
haps would have stolen you from me,
and there would not have been space
enough in the world for us both."
Ina blushed and said: "I will tell
you how it all was. Ah, Emanuele,
I cannot bear to. think of it; and if
you," she said, looking down at him
with love and still caressing his hair,
"did not make me forget all things,
I should be miserable indeed. We
were at the dinner-table,-Monsieur
and Madame Benoni and Monsieur
Marcello ; my two pupils had gone
out --Adelheide and Marie- to pass
the day at their aunt's. Madame
Benoni looked anxiously at me and
said, 'Are you not well, i[ademoiselle
Strolling?' 'Yes, I am well,' I said,
'but I have not good news from
home.'. 'I thought,' said Madame
Benoni, 'that you had no home, my
dear.' 'I have none,' I said, the tears
rising to my eyes, 'but I have a
brother, and he is ill, and wishes me
to come to him !' Ah, Emanuele!"
she said, the blood rushing scarlet all
over her face, "hide me from myself.
I loved them all, and they were so
kind to me, and it is terrible to me to
think I have'deceived them so deep-
ly. What would they say if they
knew that I were with younow? But
they will learn all from your lips.
They cannot think anything you did
was wrong; for," she said, looking up
smiling from the arms where he had

enfolded her, "they it was who first
taught me to love you; who told me
-how good and noble you were, that
you were the strong staff on which
Italy would learn to lean, that you
were the moral standard of the cam-
era.* How often have I seen dear
old Monsieur Benoni put on his spec-
tacles at the breakfast-table, and say,
'I must look to see if our friend Ber-
tani addressed the Chamber yester-
day,' and. then I would listen with
intensity to what he read; for you
were Italy to me, and Italy was you,
and my cheeks burned with pride
when I heard you defending the
right, advocating educationi foi' the
ignorant, schools' for the poor. I
thought you were like Riclelieu, and
that Italy's sword you would make
her pen. You will be minister some
day,"i she added quickly ; "yes, Mon-
sieur Benoni always said so."
"Ah," he said, smiling, "it is
JAneas, founder of Rome, you love,
not my queen's wandering lover."
"No," she said, looking up plead-
ingly into his eyes, " believe me, it is
you alone ; but I do not think I could
love any one that did not make him-
self great, and not for himself, but
for the good that he would do. Each
man's name must lie like the mark-
ing-stones on the Alps to tell where
others shall tread after him, and not
fall."
" And now," he said anxiously,
"what will you write to      your
friends ?"    l
"What shall I say ?" she said
piteously.
" That your brother is still ill and
needs you with him." .
* Chamber of Deputies.

" 0, I cannot write a lie; it is
more fixed on paper than on the
lips, - it is fugitive there and almost
escapes in giving it life. I cannot."
He took her hand in his, and looked
thoughtfully at it. "You know," he
said, "that our marriage cannot now
be known; that I have told you be-
fore. The country is in an upturned
state. I have no means, and it vould
be a clog on me, and on my rising,
which you desire, if it was known
tlatf I had fettered myself. A single
man is thought to have more time,
to be freer to act, is less suspected of
building up his own interests. I
must be free before the world, and
lie at my Aspasia's feet only in secret.
I must be the slave of my Psyche
only in the dark. Woe unto us, if
the light of prying envy falls on me."
"Ah," she said,'with a deep sigh,
" who knows but that I shall yet be
like the Cointhian maid whom Nero
wooed, borne away from her home, not
knowing her fate, to Rome, amidst
the shouts of Cesai and Augustus;
she hears in the cry her own doom,
- he is lord then of the world, she
only his slave."
" but he lovedlher to the end,-did
he not? If she was half as lovely as
you, not all her rivals could take
away even his love."
"No," she said, sighing again; "only
she marked his grave and placed a
rose-tree, to bloom away oblivion."
"And my oblivion," catching her
to him, "shall be in your arms, my
rose your lips, my stars your eyes,
four love my heaven, and yourself
my soul !" he said, pressing his lips
to hers.. "IDo you love me," he whis-
pered, "half as well as I do you ?"

"Better," she said.  "I am afraid
I love you more."
Sofi the maid came just then to
the porch to tell them that dinner
was ready, - a dinner prepared by
her own skilful hands.
"0, how pretty !" exclaimed Ina, as
she looked at the butter, which was
in the form of two little doves, with
wreaths of miniature forget-me-nots
around their necks. There was a dish
near her plate of birds around a small
mountain of rice, a real Italian risot-
to, and on the top of this was another
bird with a pansy in his beak.' There
were flowers around every plate, and
Ia's and .Emanuele's napkins were
tied in a ring of roses.
Soft's face beamed with pleasure
as she saw Ina's eyes brighten.
"I hope," she said, "that Mon-
sieur Emanuele will strew  all your
life's path with flowers.  I should
like to be always behind you to
gather up the leaves."
When Sofi had 'eft the room, Ina
looked with some surprise at her
husband, as if to say, How  strange
that a servant should speak thus
Emanuele answered her look by say-
ing: "You must ask Sofi some da,
Ina, to tell you all her story. You
will, I think, make more of a friend
of her than a servant; she will be
a comfort to you. Poor little Sofi!
she has seen much of this world's
trouble."
The dinner passed with some con-
versation with Sofi, who answered
all ina's questions with a mixture of
respect and freedom. Ina had the
delight for the ftrst time of being in
-her own house, at the head of her
Own table ; she felt proud .to be the

mistress of her little cottage, and
prouder still, when she glanced shyly
across the table, to know that he
who sat opposite and looked at her
with so much strong love in those
fathomless eyes wa's her master.
After dinner they wandered around
their tiny cage, noting all the handi-
work and taste of Sofi; she had
already unpacked her lady's trunk,
had put everything just in the right
place. Then they wandered out ann
in arm into the dusky twilight, and
thus they began-life together. " The
world was all before them where to
choose !"
CHAPTER III.
A FEW days after Ina had been
established in her new home,
Emanuele and she sitting ever close
together on their secluded porch,
which was. one bower of wild ,roses,
he asked her if she would not like
to go on the lake to pass the day.
Ina assented with readiness. She has-
tened to her room to get her hat,
which she arranged with some care
before her glass. Ina was growing
vain, for her beloved's sake ; she had
never thought much of her looks
before, but now she felt as if she
would give the world to be beautiful,
ever varying in loveliness, - that
was wvhat he liked most, - so that she
might ever startle and surprise him.
She began to have a painful dread,
sometimes, that she had not enough
in her ever to arrest his attention;
not that he was not to her the same
devoted lover as at first, but that she
understood him better every day, -

happy!' Shakespeare alone knew
all the chords that vibrate in the
human heart ; he alone looked into
the chalice of the very soul; he
alone in the little quivering dew-drop
saw all -the shades, of the rainbow
and all the shadows ,of the clouds
reflected. Immortal mind, that was
a god on earth, if you were by me
now, I would look up trembling into
your face, and say, Great master, tell
me why it is that when our cup is
filled even to the brim with the
sparkling' draught of pleasure and
happiness it yet does not suffice.
Why are we ever looking deep into
the transparent glass, and magnify-
ing the tiny specks, that lie almost
invisible there at the bottom, into
dark -winged prophecies of future
woe? Why can we not lie in the soft
down of perfect rest, but ever under
the bright feathery plumage we must
feel the restless beat of the heart
that is panting to be free ? No, not

Parth" she said, looking dreamily out
of her window, beyond the sweet-
brier that shut it in like a curtain
from the curious gaze without, -

us, not space enough to breathe in;
it is only, perhaps, the eternal, the
ethereal vastness that knows no
bounds that is wide enough for our

restless desire for ever newly opening
charms. " What should, I do," she
said to herself, "if I should grow
ugly, if I should be ill, and become
thin and pale, or old ? Would he not
love me then, as noivW? Ah," she
said,' with a great, sigh, 'if it were
now to die, 't were now to be most

s wings to spread themselves for flight;
here all is subject to the iron laws of
change and decay. Aih, Emanuele !"
she continued, stretching out her arms
to the distant mountains' tops, that
were visible from where she stood,
"would that we were there, wander-
ing on the heights, hand in hand,
anywhere beyond the present, for
eternity ! I have often," she said,
speaking her thoughts aloud, "almost
envied Francesca di Rimini her eter-
nal flitting through the air, with
Paolo's arm always around her.
What mattered it that -"
"That it was hell ?" said a low
voice behind her, and Emanuele Ber-
tani caught her inhis arms.
"I was not going to say that," she
said, shuddering; "that it was not
heaven I might have said, but not
if I had, even dreamed that you had
been so near!"
" And why not ?" he said, as they
went down stairs. "Am I Lance-
lotto ?"
"0 no," she answered, laughing;
" but I always feel as if a wo-
man ought never to let a man see
the weakness she has for him; and,
besides, do you not reirember those
terrible words of Silvio Pellico, the
last words of Francesca before she
dies, 'Eternamente puniti saren' ?"*
" But the words on PIaolo's lips, as
he expired, were 'Eternamente ti ame-
ro,'t and those shall be mine," he said.
"Our love, thank God !" she an-
swered, "may be eternal without
fear ; - but is not that the whistle of
the boat ? Come, Emanuele, when I
set my heart on a thing I cannot
* "Eternally we shall be punished."
t '* Eternally I will love thee." .

bear to be late." -They hurried on,
and reached the boat just before the
plank was raised. Ina was all glow-
ing with her walk. The boat started
and went steaming slowly down the
exquisite lake.
Ina was leaning on Enanuele's arm;
she was so close to him that her head
almost rested on his shoulder.- The
quick walk had disarranged her hair
slightly, and some of its little golden
curls had escaped from her ,net, and
were blowing across her husband's
lips.
"It is sweeter than the air," he
said, as he looked down at her fond-
ly, and then, pointing to the opposite
side of the lake, said, " Look there at
that mountain clad in snow."  Her
eyes followed where his hand point-
ed, and at the same moment she
heard some one say in a low, sweet
voice near her :
"They look like the lightning and
the thunder-cloud together,-sh so
vivid, so bright and graceful; he so
dark and dusky."
"You always indulge in poetical
ideas, my dear; she looks to me like
a pretty German girl, and he like a
very Italian Italian."
Ina turned, and saw a lady dressed
in a thick white Marseilles, buttoned
to her throat ; a cloak of the same
was thrown around her slight figure,
and a broad white hat, with a long,
sweeping green feather, shaded her
face. The pretty colors caught Ina's
eye first, and then suddenly she
started a little, and blushed deeply,
as her eye met that of the Princess,
whom she now recognized, and who
was looking at her with deep in-
terest. The Princess smiled, and mna

smiled and blushed again, and then
she turned away and began watch-
ing with intensity the clouds as they
sailed over and settled on the moun-
tains that surround the lake.
"Look !"' she said. " It reminds
me of'the description of the deluge by
Alfred de Vigny,-do you remember?
- when God promises to save alone
one young man, but he sees no harm
in bringing his heart's love with him.
He feels as if God would be appeased,
even when disobeyed, if he sees the
lovely maiden by his side, and so he
takes her up to the high mountain-
top, which is all bathed by the mists
that are rising from the surging-
waters beneath ; and the waters in-
crease. She is ever looking to her
lover for help, not to her God, and
each hope passes, and leaves them
more solitary ; but, suddenly light
breaks over her face, a white dove is
seen winging its way to where they
stand, their feet already wetted by
the flood that is fast gaining on
them; it flies nearer and nearer as
a harbinger of peace, and then it
sails past them, on, on, not heeding
the lonely two who are watching it
with such intensity. The maiden
exclaims in her agony, 'Emanuele,
vois-tu le colombe qui passe ?'*
That to me," she continued ear-
nestly, "is worse than all, worse
than Dante's doom of remembering
happier things ; it is better to have
all hope gone, than going ; that 'qui
passe' always made my blood run
cold. A nd why," she said sudden-
ly, "must it be just that one name
Emanuel.? I am glad I must al-

ways call you in Italian, not in
French. God with us ! you ought
to be very good with such a beautifu]
name. Did your mother name you
I suppose," she said thoughtfully,
bending her eyes on the ground,
"that to every mother with the first-
born son it is God with us "
"I should like," he said, gazing at
her with that peculiar dark look of
light in his eyes, "to set you for a
moment on that rock opposite us,
with a golden comb in your hand
to comb your golden hair, like your
beloved Lorelei; you would lure
again to shipwreck my little boat
of self-love and interests on your
shore. I think sometimes of my
career, which sounds to me like the
muffled drum in the distance, calling
me from the white arims that en-
chain me, to action, to the strife, of
politics and the dust of work ; and I
almost wish, that I could say with
your poet Heine: 'Es fallen     auf
mein Herz herab, all deine heiszen
Liebesblicken, wie   Sonnenstrahlen
auf emn Grab.'* Heine was great. I
should have liked to be such a man
as he. What cared he for the world,
for life's shafts, for death's darkness ?
He drank the rich draught of love
even to the lees, he mocked at mis-
fortune, jested with eternity, and left
the world full of the fragrance of the
flowers he had thrown into it."
" How can you speak so lightly,
so unlike yourself ? " said Ina, her
lips trembling. "You    know   that
Heine's life was poisonous, and that
he lay seven years on his mattress
grave, a victinri to himself, the poor
* "All thy warm looks of love fall on my
heart like the rays of the sun on a grave."

worm   of the mortal body God had
t given him."
l   "What care I," he said, watching
? with pleasure the varied emotions
that were passing over her face, "for
the end, so long as one can enjoy to
the full, intellectually and physical-
ly ? , So long as one's work is high
and good, what matters it what one
is himself?   Heine worked for his
country, for freedom of thought and
action, and his writings rolled like a
fresh stream through Germany, and
gave it new strength and life."
"I do not believe," said Ina, "that
any arrows that are aimed by an
arm that is not strong can reach the
mark; that waters which are slimy
and muddy at the bottom can be so
pure to drink. I will not believe that
a good life does not strengthen good
deeds, and turn, perhaps, aperishable
flower into an immortelle on earth."
" Do you think," he said, "that, if
Victor Emanuel led a better life,
Italy would be a higher nation ?"
"Yes," she answered, quickly, "you
know it would; a high king would
make high ministers, high ministers
better deputies, and better deputies
a better people."
"You forget, my love, the order of
things," he said, laughing ; " the peo-
ple elect the members of the Cham-
ber, they in their turn elect the
ministers, and the ministers sustain
the king."
"I do not care," she said, flushing
scarlet. "No good influence is lost;
the sun sheds down its colors onthe
earth, and the earth gives back its
dyes to the sky."
Ina was so -earnest when she was
interested that she forgot all things

save the subject which she was dis-
cussing ; but just then she raised her
eyes, and met those of the Princess
fixed on her. The Princess turned
away her face quickly, but not before
Ina had seen a tear glistening on her
cheek. Ina turned away too, and sat
silently looking into the white foam
that the boat made as she steamed
on. She was, wondering why the
Princess looked so sadly at her, but
her woman's heart answered    her
quickly that she was alone. Two of
her ladies sat at a respectful distance
from her; etiquette did not allow her
to talk freely with them, and her
bridegroom was standing at the end
of the deck looking into nothingness,
and knocking the ashes of his cigar
into the waters of the lake. " Could
she be envying me ?" said Ina to
herself. " She might well do so, if a
princess's heart can envy, for have I
not the perfect love and companion-
ship of my husband ? We are, both,
she and I, starting for the race of
life at about the same age, at the
same time, under the same given cir-
cumstances; but I fear her path is
burnished with gold, mine gilded by
the rays of the sun; hers will glitter
with precious stones, mine with the
raindrops that fall aslant from the
rainbow. Poor thing ! how I should
like to run to her, and kiss away
the tear that stood on her soft cheek
- and she would think me mad if
I did ! yet are we not the same
blood, made by the same hand, both
women, both educated ? why should
there be such a barrier between us ?"
"Emanuele," she said, suddenly,
"have you ever spoken with the
King ?2"  ,
2

"Many times," he answered,laugh-
ing. "What makes you think of the
King now?"
"Is he affable, kind, cordial, or
distant and haughty?"
"He is perfectly natural, very kind-
hearted, simple in his manners, very
intelligent, and -"
"And does he talk to you like
every one else ? "
"Necessarily some forms have to
be gone through .on entering his
presence, but, these apart, one feels,
I think, easier with him than with
most men."
"What a pity he is so bad !" said
Ina, quickly.
" He is very brave, very gener-
ous   "
" With money," said Ina, "that he
robs from his poor people."
" You are hard on our re galant'
uoimo," said Bertani, laughing.
Ina did not answer. They were
nearing Fluelen, that most lovely
vista of mountains, which is at the
extreme end of the lake. The boat
drew up to the pier, and there was
a general rush to cross the plank.
Ina stood back and watched the
Princess as she took the arm of the
Prince and walked away. Just as
she had gone, Ina saw 'on the seat
she had occupied a little book lying.
She knew it belonged to the Princess,
for she had seen it in her hand.
She slipped her arm hastily out of
Emanuele's, ran over to the empty
seat of the Princess, and took the
volume. It was a small book bound
in Russia leather, with gold edges,
and a crown in gold and three initials
under it on the back ; it looked like
a note-book, being much longer than

it was wide, and with a golden clasp
to' it. Ina looked down on it ten-
derly; she felt almost as if she held
the Princess's hand in hers. She
walked thoughtfully on by Eman-
uele's side. They sat down under
the trees in a little shady place, and
Emanuele covered Ina with rose-
leaves, which he pulled from the
wild roses that grew over her head ;
and then they threw roses at each
other, and Ina laughed like a child,
and Emanuele told her that he might
do her harm in taking her for one
of the flowers herself, and she was
happy with him, and he was proud
of her, and Ina said: "I wonder
what the Princess is doing now,
if any flowers have fallen into her
lap. Ah, Emanuele, how     terrible
golden chains are 1 and think of
having one's roses of rubies only,
and the leaves of enamel, and the,
dew-drops only of diamonds. I think
I should. wet them  then with my
own tears often; one cannot have
all things in this life."~
He drew her face fondly to him,
and said, "Few would hesitate to
choose the glitter before the per-
fume."
" But you," she said, anxiously,"-
"which would you prefer ?"
"I will wait till I am tempted,"
he said, " before I answer that ques-
tion."
Ina was only half satisfied with
his answer, but they were hastening
to the boat, which was waiting .for
their arrival to raise the plank. - Ina
looked around to see if the:Princess
was there.' Her back was turned to
her, and the Prince was by her
side; they were talking together.

Ina would not for the world have,
interrupted them. She waited until
the Prince had left her side, then
she scarcely dared approach her,
for Ina was timid .by nature. In a
moment more she saw the Princess
start slightly, put her hand hastily
in her pocket as if searching for
something, and then look anxiously
on the ground, Ina slipped from
Emanuele's side and approached the
Princess.
" I trust you will pardon me," said
Ina, "but I found this book, for which
I fear you have been searching, on
the ground just near where you were
sitting." Ina spoke in German. The
Princess turned at the sound of her
voice, her face lighted by a smile so
lovely that Ina thought her beauti-
ful, - it irradiated all her face, as
if a sunbeam had suddenly shone
on it.
"I thank you so verynmuch."
Ina made a movement as if to go.
The Irincess made a slight motion
with her hand, as if she still had
something to say to her. Ina waited.
"Ilam glad I lost my little book,"
she said, "since it has given me an
opportunity of speaking with you;
ever since I first saw you at the
window I have felt my heart go out
to you!"
" And mine to you," said Ina with
warmth, and blushing.
The Princess smiled  again, and
said: " How    often have -I chafed
against the chains of etiquette which
bound me, when I wanted to runm
over to you, and speak to you as to
a sister. It is strange, the elec-.
tric chord that draws us to some
persons ! It is so seldom that I feel

it, but when I do it is all-power-
ful."
"I have often wished," said Ina,
"that you were not a princess, that
I might come and put .my arms
about your neck"
A shade passed over the young
Princess's face, and she said quickly:
"We are of the same dust; you
too are on your bridal tour ?"
"Yes," said Ina, coloring this time
to her brow.
"I feared," said the Princess, "you
might think me very rude, I looked
at you so much, but there are times
7 when we feel an irresistible interest
to know from' whence and where
bound is the life of another ; it is
not curiosity."
"Yes," said Ina, thoughtfully ; -"the
face does not tell us enough, we long
to look into he very heart."
"How sad it is," said the Princess,
"that our paths on earth deviate so!
We catch a glimpse of a.life, and we,
must leave it as a picture, enly 6e
never think of the, ingnirate one
tWith any movie longings, we accept
it as 'it stands before our eyes, we
neither would take from nor add to
i; but it is different with the living
painting, it dissolves before our view
and leaves us with an indefinite long-
ing,-it is like an unfinished poem."
"Yes," said Ina, " we long to know
if.the person is happy or unhappy."
"If she was a beloved wife, and
blessed as a mother," said the Prin-
cess, with a smile which had some-
thing of sadness in it, as she looked
at Ina. ,
" I shall know of your blessings,"
.said Ina, smiling brightly,-"they will
go forth through all countries ; and

if," she said, hesitatingly,-- "if you
are ever perfectly happy folding in
your arms all that is best and sweet-
est in life, will you let your thoughts
wander a moment from the fulness
around you to remember one who
once met you, felt all her. heart
drawn towards you, and who will be
reading of and rejoicing with glad
tears in her eyes over your happi-,
ness ?"
The tears rushed to th6 Princess's
eyes, she could not speak, but she
pressed her hand over Ina's, which
lay on the bench at her side; hers
was sparkling with jewels, Ina's had
one little plain gold ring on the
marriage finger. They sat for a mo-
merit thus. Ina raised htr eyes,
and looked 'across the boat. Eman-
uele was standing leaning carelessly
against one of the pillars that sup-
ported the little deck, his face was
averted.-
"How   strong he   looks!"  she
thought; "how handsome he is'!"
He turned, and their eyes met.. Ina
lose. " I must go," she said.
"Shall we never meet again ?" the
Princess said sadly.
" J  ust so," said Ia; "but wheth-
er eve do or no, I shall never forget
you."
The Princess looked hastily down ;
she unclasped a gold circle that was
around her wrist, and said almost
timidly to Ina, "Will you wear this
in memory of me?"
Ina clasped it around her arm, and,
saying "Believe me, I will wear it
as long as I. live," left the Princess's
side, and went back to her husband.
" How long you have been !" said
Emanuele.; " I missed you; we have

not been so long separated since our
marriage ; I felt lost without my
little Ina."
"And I too am so happy to be
with you again," she said, looking up
into his' face. " The Princess is love-
ly. I understood for the firsttime,
when with her, the feeling of loyalty
to one's queen; I thought I would
have died for her!"
"-Then," he said, laughing, "you
will pardon henceforth with more
ease my devotion to my king."
" Ah," she said, pouting prettily,
"that is different. Victor Emanuel
does not deserve the feeling."
" wait," he said, "until I present
my little bride to him; royalty is
infectious."
"I will never," said ,Ina, drawing
herself up with a slightly proud look,
-" I will never speak to him ; not
because there is a difference in our
positions, I do not feel that, but he
is a man I have no respect for."
Emanuele's brow knitted for a
moment, and then he turned away,
saying,  " You  shall .o - as you
please."     -
A violent rain came on, and they
were obliged to seek what shelter,
they could. The boat drew up at
last to the wharf. Ina was dripping-
ly wet, her hair had fallen around her
face, and Emanuele hurried her off
the boat. The last she saw of the
Princess was just as she was getting
into the coach that was awaiting her.
Ina was holding up her clothes, and
gathering herself as well as she could
under-the umbrella that her husband
was holding ; she caught the eye of
the Princess, and looked back laugh-
ing.

CHAPTER IV.

THE first thing that Ina saw on
reaching home was Sofi standing
in the door-looking out for them, and
holding back a beautiful white dog.
"Sardo," called Emanuele.
The dog uttered a cry of joy, and .
bounded away from Sofi to his mas-
ter.. ' Ina looked at. him with delight,
He was about half as large as a large'
Newfoundland, his legs and his back
were closely clipped, and the rest of
his hair was long and glistened like
snow; a bright blue ribbon tied
just over his eyes gave him an air of
coquetry which pleased Ina. le
sprang all over his master like a mad
creature, and then, seemingly recog-
nizing Ina as something that belonged
to Emanuele, he turned and licked
the hand which was caressing him.
" 0  you   beauty !"  she  said.
"Where : did he come from? Did
you send for him, Emanuele? fHow
good you are !"
"When did the man bring him?".
said Emanuele.
" Just after you had gone, sir."
"I thought," said Emanuele, " that
he would be such a pretty picture by
your side, You know I am an artist
in all but the power of execution,
and ever since we came here I have
been painting you and Sardo 'in my
mind's eye' together. There," lie
said, standing away from them a little,
" you look like everything that is
lovely and mythological. It was not
truly a desire to see my dog, but to
see you two together."
" What an odd idea!" said na,
laughing. "0, what has Sardo got in
his mouth ?"

Ie came straight to Ina  id hand-
ed her her haPdkerchief. She took it
from him, and saw that he had held
it so delicately in his mouth as not
to tear the muslin at all.
" Come here !"  said  Emanuele;
"take my watch, sir, and give it to
La Padrona !"I
The dog went to him, put his twoi
fore paws on his knees, and, taking
his watch out of his pocket with his
teeth, unfastened the chain from his
button-hole, and then handed it care-
fully to Ina.
"0, how I shall love him !" said
Ina, enchanted.
"Walk on your hind legs ! " said
Emanuele. The dog obeyed. "Go
and kiss La Padrona!" The dog looked
at his master, as if to say, that is an
easy task, and went over to Ina, and
gave her a most loving caress. "Give
her your paw, sir ! the other ! now the
other !" The dog obeyed. " Fall down
dead!"  The' dog uttered a whine,
and stretched himself at Ina's feet.
"Ah," she said, growing pale, "poor
thing ! something really is the mat-
ter with him !" Emanuele laughed.
"Come in to dinner," said Sofi;
"you cannot feed on love, and you
have had nothing else, I believe, all
day."
They went in to dine, followed by
Sardo, who had sprung to his feet at
the sound of Sofi's voice.
They had been but a few minutes
at the table when Ina heard a strange
noise; she looked up and saw Sardo
trying to get the keys out of the
pantry lock. He soon succeeded, and
came all joy, wagging his tail, to
bring them to her.
" Take this bone," said Erianuele,

" but do not eat it on the carpet!"
The dog walked immediately to a
place near the hearth, where the
floor was bare, and began crunching
his bone.
"0," said Ina, playfully, " I never
saw so charming a dog. I shall love
him better than you. He has the
most beautiful eyes I ever saw."
Just then she looked up, and
caught her husband's fixed on her, as
she was bending over Sardo, wits ad-
miration and love.. "Except," she
said, blushing, " yours."
"I thank you," he said. "I will
exchange with Sardo."
"I wonder," said Ina, thoughtfully,
"if dogs have a heaven of their own
to go to; they must have souls,--
they are so full of love, they dream,
they die for those they love, they
are more faithful than men."
" I do not believe," said Emanuele,
"in the necessity of a heaven ; he has
that on' earth at your feet: and as
for fidelity, my love, look not for it in
this world; be content if you find
constancy!"
" I do not understand the differ-
ence," said Ina. " I will look it out
in the dictionary."
"Seek for it, my Ira, in the dic-
tionary of life; there you will see it
admirably defined: fidelity not exist-
ing, the word 'is not to be found;
constancy, a certain fondness always
for one, despite of a great deal of in-
fidelity ; infidelity, a constant ten-
dency to roam in one's affections, and
with no sense of constancy. .Do you
understand the difference now ?"
"I do not like your definitions at
all," said Ina, sadly. "I do not want
to hear about it."

"That is a pretty conception, and
true," he said, " of Aleardo Aleardis,
in his- patriotic songs; do you re-
member it? The lover loves his
mistress and she loves him, and all
the hours of their ecstasy are paint-
ed so that you feel them; then one
night he is dragged in a car past
her window, where her lovely head
lies unconsciously sleeping amidst
the perfumed linen of her bed; he
draws on his grating, with Giotto's
consoling art, her features, and he
is no more alone ; they erects his
scaffold in the dull marshes, and a
little bird comes and settles on it
and sings gayly on the dark beam,
and the early anemones had 'scarce
budded over the ditch, his friend
says, where he saw his body thrown,
when thou also, 0 lady, didst sing,
rejoicing, alas ! in a new love."
"I wish," said Ina, flushing, "that
you would not say those things with
so much feeling ; we all know that
there are bad women, that there are
Cressidas and Clytemnestras and
Lady Hamlets; but that does not
make out the world of women faith-
less."
"I believe," he'said, "that I am
the only man that can cry out Eu-
reka."
"I will not," said Ina, "accept a
compliment sofalse, and at the ex-
pense, too, of all my sex. I will not
be so disloyal. Take it back, air ;
think well of all, or not of me!"
" Then I should love all perforce,"
"No, no," she answered, "that is
not a necessary consequence at 'all.
I want you to say when you die, like
De Mauprat, ' Je n'ai jamais aim6

qu'une tame! et jamais je n'ai
enti que l'dtreinte de sa main !'
One ,day passed like another with
our hero and     heroine. The days
melted into each other like)rainbow
tints, full of everything and noth-
ing. In the evenings they generally
strolled out to walk; often Emanuele
read to Ina, while she sat embroider.
ing under the trees, with Sardo at
her (eet, and then he would throw
down his book and come and lie
down on the grass too with Sardo,
and she would play ,with his dark
hair, and they would talk of their
future, and their love immeasura-
ble; and so the days sped on, one
losing itself in the other's dye. Ina
often looked for the Princess, but she
never met her again, and so 'she
knew that she had gone away; she
felt lonelier, though, when she knew
that it was so.
One evening as they strayed out
on the shore, Ina gathering shells
to make a collar for Sardo, who was
carrying her book in his mouth, they
saw a little row-boat pass empty.
Emanuele hailed it, and soon Ina and
he sat side by side whilst the oars
silvered the water with their stroke,
and threw evanescent pearls into Ina's
hand, as she was passing it through
the soft ripples. All was still; the
stars were burning their clear tapers
in the sky. Sardo was at Ina's feet.
They both sat a long time silent.
At last Ina said : "Is not this like
eternity, Emanuele ? so still, so peace-
ful, with a sense so perfect of repose,
and yet with no monotony; all
hushed the din and noise of life,
and yet love enveloping'one as with
a -great mantle, which warms and

weighs not upon the heart. The ciark-
ness is forgetfulness of past troubles,
which it shuts out;, the freshness
of the waters is eternal youth. The
stars are faith and hope lighted in
our horizon. The oarsman, as we
see him now transfigured by the dim
light, is our guide to knowledhrm  Is
it not like eternity, Emanete ?"
"I do not believe," he said slowly,
"in the immortality of the soul.
Therefore I cannot believe in   an
eternity, save as an eternal material
reproduction of life on earth."
"Emanuele," she   said, growing
deadly pale, "do not say so, do not
speak thus !" and she clung beseech-
ingly to his arm, and looked up pit-
eously into his face.
He passed his arm around her
waist, and. drew  her beating heart
nearer to h4m.
"Yes, 4a, I tell you the truth.
I think that one lives here as a God ;
one has infinite knowledge, the in-
tensity of love, the delight of in-
tellectual force, and even the incense
of worship always at least from some
one soul."
"What do you call a soul? " said
Ina, impetuously.
" The light that is within us."
"Whence does it come ?" said Ina,
catching her breath.
He did not answer.
"Where does it go ?" she con-
tinued.
"It is extinguished like a lamp,
and then all goes ouf. Some of the
greatest of men have not believed, -
men like Voltaire, Hume, Gibbon."
"And how have they died ?" she
said. " Without hope, with cringing
fear, which they dared not reveaL.

Ah ! well did Byron say, Give me, if
you can, a solace as sweet as the faith
you take from me ; if it be false, then
at the end I have only your dull
tiny,  if it be true, I have its im-
mense consolation here, and unor-
tality hereafter.' Do not say the
greatest men; men like Socrates,
Marcus Aurelius -great souls that
could not die -even without a light
to guide them, knew no darkness.
Michael Angelo, William of Orange,
Washington, Sir Philip Sidney, - if
the greatest means the highest, the
noblest and the best, they believed."
"The greatest means those that
were sufficient unto themselves," he
answered,-" men who knew so much
that they felt the need of no God,
like your own Goethe ; his intellect
pierced the great veil of mystery,
and shed its own sun around. That
is but a figurative expression in the
Bible, that God made the light ; each
man sheds his own light, - if -it be
small, he is a worm; if it be great,
he is a God."
"Goethe cried out for more light
at the end," she'said ; " if it were as
you say, then he would not have felt
that want. But I do not believe it
was as unbelievers think ; I believe
only his earthly eyes strained them-
selves to see once more the sun, as
we gaze at a face more intensely
from which we are parting. Goethe
believed ; a thousand things make
me know it."
"Why, Ia, nothing dies in one
sense, because it is recreated in some
other form; this is the economy of
nature, this is its wonderful mystery. /
The whole earth throbs with life.
Perhaps my intellect will fly to new

matter, and be again a man, and
think and know ; it may live in a
book, and thus give forth light which
may ignite- the . spark that would
otherwise be dead : and as for my
body, that returns to flowers, that
blossoms in the trees, in the long
waving grass."
"Ah !" said Ina, with a great sigh
of pain ; " and tell me, what do you
think of Christ ? "
" That he was a great, good man,
whose presence was necessary to
purify the world."_
O, tell me," she said, " in all the
history of this world was there ever
another, who in poverty, without
power, without arms, without learn-
ing, young, alone, in a short time won
a kingdom upon earth -that no time
can destroy ? Was it not from an
inspiration beyond, above ? Mahom-
et came, and was great, a leader,
with great knowledge, with 'arms,
'and' yet he could win for himself
followers only through the hopes
of conquest and the promises of
blood."
"I do not know," he said, stroking
her flushed cheek, " of a thing on
earth that should make me wish more
for immortality than to live on,
through unknown time and space,
with -iy Ina; but this cannot be;
therefore let us live to-day, for to-
morrow we die."
"Ah, Emanuele," she said, with a
suppressed sob ; " whydid you never
say these things to me before ?
My paradise on earth seems gone,
and I shall ever wearily stand now
without the doors."
" Perhaps," he said, "you may
gain admittance, like the poor peri;

-~IN

I you can bring my soul at last, and
then the gates will open, and we
shall be together yet. Would that
.not be a prize worth striving for?"
" Ah, say that you have jested
with me ! " she said, throwing her head
passionately on his shoulder, "say
that you believe ; say that, and I
shall be happy once more."
"Then I. will believe," he said.
I will believe blindly. I will ac-
cept any doctrine you choose, only
do not let us talk again of these
things. We are here to love one
another, not to discuss and argue the
great theories of life ; leave those to
men, but let a beautiful woman be
our rest, our haven."
Ina longed to answer that she saw
no matter too deep or too serious for'
a man to speak of to a woman who
was his companion; but although he
was her lover always, yet there were
times when she felt it were best not
to use her power, and she knew this
.now ; so she felt already like the
peri, shut out fromim who was her
heaven, and she was desolate and
alone. But when they came home,
and Emanuele drew her to him and
kissed her eyes and whispered in her
ear words of love, then she forgot all
things save that he loved her ; only
once vhen they were sitting looking
up at the skies, he said, " I used
to think, when I was a boy, that we
went there when we died !" She
shuddered and clung closer to him.
And so the days and weeks rolled on
into months. Ina used to think some-
times that Emanuele needed more va-
riety, work, or companionship. Once
she said to him: "When shall we go
to Turin ? Do you not think it wonNd

be well to go soon ? The summer
days are almost. past.  0, let me
write,' dear Emanuele, and tell our
good friends the Benonis where we
are, that I am your wife ; at least, if
the world may not know it yet, do
not let me keep up a deception be-
fore them. I have not written once
since that first letter ; it is so dread-
ful to me to play a part that is
false."
Emanuele looked at her as she had
never, seen him  before ; his eyes
darkened, whilst a red, angry color
spread itself over his face, but he
said quietly': "'Ina, do you not trust
me wholly ? Our marriage cannot be
known as yet. I have given you
once my reasons. I owe it to my
country to work for her, and to be
free to do so. Come here," he said,
"and give me both your hands."
She came to him and put her
hands in his. "Promise me - your
word is enough - that until I say to
you that it is well to speak, no ohe
shall know of our relations to each
other'
Ina was silent; she stood lookin
steadily at him, very pale, and th n
said slowly, " I promise you."
" I thank you," he said, drawing
her head down to him, and kissing
her hair, "for you have shown per-
'fect confidence in me."
Ina was pensive, and Emanuele
said to her: " Tell me, my love,
what you are thinking of."
"I was thinking," she said, " at
that moment, of Alfred de Musset, of
his words, ' J'aime et je veux souffrir.'
I do not like it, yet perhaps when
one loves intensely one always suf-
fers; no rose that has not thorns has

fragrance, and yet it is sad that it
must be so."
"My motto is," said Emanuele,
' J'aime et je veux jouir.'"
"That is worse than the other,"
said Ina, shaking her head. "Do
you know what I should choose foi
myself if I were a man ? 'J'aime et
je veux lutter'; that is one's only
strength - to battle, and then to die !"
" According to your ideas, one
would have to be like the knight
of Delorges, and seek his lady's
gauntlet among lions and leopards."
"No," said Ina; "I mean only a
moral gladiator."
" Come here, Sardo, give your mis-+
tress a . kiss, and tell her not- to
be thinking of these great questions;
that they will make heir little head
ache."
Sardo went up to Ina al he was
commanded, and did his best to dis-
perse her thoughts.
But Ina had grown paler of late,
the oung rounded look of'maiden-
ho d had somewhat left her face,
a d    re was less of laughter in
er deep blue eyes. "Come," said
anuele, "come out with ie to

put her arm in his; they walked
on silently until they came to some
large forest-trees.  a lookedI tired,
and Emanuele drew her down on the
seat which was under \them, all in
the shade.
"Tell me," he said, bending over
her, "have you no secret all your

Ina turned away her face.
"Anima mia," he said, " will you
not whisper one word in my ear ?"
She burst"into tears, and flung hei
arms about his neck, hiding her face
all flushed, on his shoulder.
He stroked back her curls, and
she, nestling closer to him, said
with stammering voice : " Emanuele,
should you be happy if it were so ?
would you love me more ?    I am
so happy, only I feared to. tell
you.       .
"I could not love you better," he
said, "I could not be even happier
than I am, but I am glad of all that
you are glad of."
"Ah," she said, with a great sigh
of rel ef, " I am glad you spoke to
me.    never should have had the
cour ge to speak to you. I am not
afr d of you," she said, laughing,
" and yet I am. Do you know,"
looking up at him very solemnly,
"what I think would be happiest of
all? It has been so often in my,
heart of late,-to die just at that
most blessed moment, you near me:
I would place it in your arms, and
then it would be soe sweet to close
one's eyes and rest. It is cowardly
of me, -'is it not ?- to shrink from
life ; but I am so afraid to live, and
I do not know why."
"It is cruel of you," he said, "not
to think of me. Do I not make you
happy, my belove  that you should
have such though ? "
" o  yes," she murmured, "stoo
happy; it cannot - t, nothing here
endures."        /
" It .is only because you are not
well, Ina, that you *have gloomy
fancies," he answered.

It was but a few days after this
' that Ina was sitting alone in her
little parlor, listening for Emanuele's
r footstep ; he had gone out to the
post-office. The leaves had fallen
away from the vine that clad the
cottage, where he had brought her
as his bride in the early spring. The
air was so fresh now that the win-
dows could no longer be left open,
but Ina could see far down the path
that led to the house, now that the
view was no longer obstructed by
the summer roses ; the last one had
dropped long since away, and it
looked less lovely now  than then,
Presently Ina saw her husband com-
ing slowly up the path ; he had a
letter in  his hand which he was
reading attentively, and his brow was
overcast. She ran to the window, but
he did not look up at her ; she opened
the door, and went forward to meet
him; he seemed troubled.
"Emanuele, do tell me if you have
any bad news !"
"None," he said, quietly. "Ihave
a letter here which recalls me to
Turin, and immediately."
" Then we shall go," she said. "I
am glad."
" You cannot come, Ina."
" And why not ?" she said, looking
up with a frightened look into his
face, --"why not ? ",
" It is impossible; you will stay
here until I come back."
"I cannot stay here alone," she
said, with  almost despair in her
voice.
."Ina," he said, taking her hand in
his, "you will not shrink from your
duty; youwill do that which is best for
us both. I do not want you to sadden

last moments; be yourself.    I
1sha1 not be long away.
She turned away to hide her tears,
but said quietly, " I will do whatever
you wish."  The next day Emanuele
was to leave at nine o'clock. Ina
tried to keep up to the very last. He
lookedat his watch as they sat to-
gether the last morning ; it was ten
minutes of nine,-Ina saw it by the
clock. They had spoken but a few
words, and those far from the subject
that was pressing on their hearts;
presently he rose, and said, "I must
go, Ina."
But she threw her arms around him
in an agony of grief ; she clung to
him, she spoke in broken sobs. "0,
tell me that you love me ! tell me
that you will love me always ! that
you, will come again ! soon ! soon !
Ah, I cannot bear it t Tell me once
more that you love me."
He was frightened at the terrible
state of agitation which she was in.
He had never seen Ina before give way
so entirely to her feelings; she gasped
as though she could not get her breath.
He said to   her sternly, "Ina,
are you not a woman? are you a
child?"
In a moment more she drew her-
self up and stood facing him perfectly
quiet ; she was very pale, but her
face was as still as if no emotion had
just passed over it.
%" Now go," she said ; "but give me
one more kiss."
He kissed her lips, and hurried
away.
And Ina and Sofi were alone to-
gether with Sardo in the little home,
once so dear,'2once so full, now life-
less and empty. Ina would' wander

around like a shadow  sometimes she
would touch the furniture to see if_ it
were real, if all had not been a dream;
she was so lonely, her heart ached
with a dull pain. Sofi tried to cheer
her up, and she was always a comfort
to Ina.
"Now don't fret so," she would say;
"you will grow pale and ugly. I must
keep you fresh as a flower for Mon-
sieur Emanuele. Life is sad enough
without borrowing trouble ; you know
he loves you better than his life,,and
that is enough to keep you cheerful."
Ina looked up and smiled.
"There 'now, you look like your'
self again; why, even the heavens do
not look pretty when the stars go out
at night, and your face islike a star-.
less sky when you do not smile. I
would not like to have him see you
now!"
" 0, I am so alone!" said Ina.
"You must think all thptime, not
of that, but how soon he will come
back to you, and then of the joy you
will have together when there are
three to sit amongst the roses."
"Yes," said Ina, smiling the hap-
piest smile that Sofi had seen on her
face since he went, "that will be a
happy time."
Every evening Sofi, Ina, and Sardo
went to the post-office ; it was their
only walk. Sardo would carry home
the paper, and if Ina got a letter there
was a quiet light in her eyes ; if not,
she would sit sadly, doing nothing,
but looking dreamily at the clouds as
they sailed by overhead, until the
twilight deepened into night ; and
then, when the evening came, she
would wander after Sofi, and, sitting
down by her side, ask her to cheer

ters were full of love, but short,-he
never spoke of his return nor of Ina's
coming to him. Ina's were pa ion-
ate appeals to himrto come, an reca-

dragged wearily on; it no more sped
away on the roseate wings of love.
The short warm summerhad brought a
leafless cold autumn, and all Ina's
comfort was Sofi and Sardo. Often she
would fling her arms around him and
say, "Sardo, you love him too, - do
you not?' Yo wish he were here, you
are lonely alsowithout him? Ah, Sar-

Th1e dog would look up at her with
great sad eyes, and whine as .if he
were sorry for her.
" Tell ne," said Ina, one day, -
"tell me your story, Sofi. Monsieur
told me that you would some day,
and I am dull."-
"I -do not think," said Sofi, "that
Monsieur'knew a great deal about it ;

have a sister, Madam, who is not
like me; she is educated and lectures
in public, and writes for the papers,
and married an Italian political exile.
My father and mother gave me as
good an education as they did to her,
for my father was proud of me ; but
somehow I could not .learn, so they
sent me to my aunt in Manchester,
and she was to take especial care of
.my learning. But, Madam, they
could not teach me to read or write!
I was so anxious to learn, I used to
go and kneel down and pray God to
let me learn to read, and it would not
come. I learn everything by- my
eye. I listened to all the stories my
aunt told me from the Bible. I
caught an idea quicker than any of
my cousins ; but when they brought
me my book, I would sit dully gazing
at it, and then I would get into a
passion of anger, I would bite it, and,
getting up, put it under my feet and
trample upon, it with fury. This
went on every day, - anger, remorse,
and shame, and yet I could not study.
The master used to say he had never
known so bright a. child, and he
could not account for it. Well, I
was only just thirteen years old when
an old m4 came to see my aunt;
he noticed me a good deal, and used
to draw me on his knees, and play
with my golden curls. They said he
was a Count, and that he had lost his
property in all the troubles of Italy,
and now he gave lectures, and taught
for his living. I used to hear them
talk of him. I did not like him much;
he looked. old and ugly enough to

me, but they said he was only forty-
five. You know, Madam, that to a
little girl like me he seemed old
enough to be my grandfather. He
asked me if I would like to be his
wife. I did .not know .what that
meant, but I said yes, if he would
not make me study. A few days af-
ter my aunt told me that Count Mario
had asked me to be his wife ; that a
baby as I was must be very proud,
and that it would make my mamma
and papa very happy; that he was
going to take me back to them, for
they were in America.. I cried a
little, but said I should like to go to
my mamma; and so he came that
night, and he kissed me and put a
gold chain around my neck, -it
was so heavy it hurt me, - and there
was a beautiful little watch, made by
Dent of England, hanging to it, and
there were my initials and his crest
'all in brilliants that sparkled like the
water when the sun is upon it ; and
then they dressed me in white, and
curled my hair around my head, and
took me to the church, and I heard
the people say 'What a sacrifice !'
and one old woman cried when she
looked at me. Well, I was married,
and the Count carried me back to
America. I could not love him, Mad-
am, but he was kind enough to me.
He did not get on very well in teach-
ing, and so he opened a first-class
boarding-house, and it was all my
own. I used to feel such pride as I
looked over the banisters, and saw
the shining stair-rods, and I thought,
All that I am mistress of ! but my
heart sickened when I saw my hus-
band. We got .on very well;Nyoung
as I was, I seemed to know how to

do everything, and I cooked, and I
purchased all the meats, and I kept
the house, and the people used to say
that they had never known anything
so remarkable. Then, before I was
fourteen I was a mother, but somehow
I did not love my child with that new
feeling of bliss that people talk of.
I played witly it like a doll. It was
a sweet little thing ; some day. I will
show you its likeness. Well, Madam,
I had another little child ; that wts a
boy, the dearest little fellow in the
world, and the people said that they
did not know which of the three was
the mother when they looked at us ;
and before I was twenty I had had
six children, but I lost four, - three
at their birth, and one lived a year,
and he 's now, with a little lamb at
his feet, in Greenwood Cemetery un-
der the trees. Then my husband
took a fancy to come back to his own
country, and we sold everything and
crossed the ocean again; we went to
Naples -   Ah, Madam," said Sofi,
covering her face, "there was where
all my troubles began. I met at the
hotel there a young officer, he knew
the Count slightly ; well, we began
to look at each other across the table,
and then to speak, and then we
walked together, and I had never
known what love was. The Count
had been good to me in New York, but
now he began run after women of
all kinds. I would not have minded
if I had been old and ugly, but I was
a joy for any man then, and I got so
disgusted with him that it hurt me
to look at him, so I thought always
with a beating heart of my young
officer. Ah, Madam, if you had seen
him, -it was impossible not to love

him, and I was almostmad for love
of him, and we decided to run away
together. I thought it was no wrong,
because I' gave up all, my position,
my honor, all for love:"
"And your children," said Ina,
quickly, " what became of them? Ah,
Sofi," she said sadly, "I thought you
could do no wrong. How all my
planks are slipping from me!"'-
'"Madam, don't reproach me, or I
shall go mad. I loved him, - you
know what love is; it 's awful to
feel your whole soul- going out of
you ! And he loved me ! Ah," she
said, standing .still and looking as if
dreamily back, " I can say I have
been loved once."
Ina covered her face with her
hands.
"Why, Madam, when he went to
the field to exercise his troops, he
shouted out my name, instead of the
orders', he sent his servant of the
ordnance twenty times from the field
to know if I were well, and what I.
was, doing ; he would never eat his
dinner unless I was on his knee, and
he would not take a mouthful unless
I tasted it first ; he would kiss my
feet, and lie with them in his breast,
and I would rush from   his arms
madly crying out, My child, give
me my child. Ah, it was terrible,
when the first was past, - the first
dream of passion ! Then I shrieked
aloud for my child, I tore my hair;
he fell at my feet, and I said he was
a seducer, and I hurled him from me.
MlVy husband, carried his complaints
to the minister, and my young officer
was disgraced. They stripped him
of his epaulets, and still he loved
me ! I ivent to the king,. and he

listened to my story, and gave me a
writing to carry to the minister ; the
minister said the king had nothing
to do with those things, nor had he
any power to give back my officer's
title ; then I flung myself at the
minister's feet - 0 Madam, I lay
there on the floor before him, and I
told him life was short, that this life
was not all, and at the last judgment
he must answer for all the misery he
gave. '0, give back his honor,' I
cried; 'you will not repent of mal-
ing two miserable creatures happy!',
and he lifted me up and took pity on
me, and said he would make him a
temporary officer in the Volunteer
Corps ; and then he joined the Gari-
baldians, and he was shot at the head
of his soldiers, and I nursed him day
and night. I went into the hospitals,
and took care of all those poor, suf-
fering creatures,-God have mercy
on them !-and I fled from him for
my child; they had taken her to
Rome, - it was always my little girl'
I seemed so wild.for. And I went
to the old Pope, and kneeled to him,
and told him I was a mother, and he
smiled ; and I weqt to Cardinal An-
tonelli, and he saw my agony, and
they gave me a sight of my darling,
and I cried over her, and she said,
'You are my mamma, whatever they
tell of you;. they say I must not
pray for you because you went away
and left me.', And then they tore her
from my arms, and I went back."
" And your - your friend," said
Ina, hesitating.
" He ! 0 Madam," and Soft's face
looked wild for a moment with pas-
sion, "he married another, not for
love, but for money. I had abanl-

doned him, and he had no means ;
his career was finished, for the Vol-
unteers were sent home, - and I sold
my little things that were left me,
and I pawned my diamond ear-rings
and pin, and my watch and chain,
and I followed him to Naples. I got
there late at night, and I knew his
house: I saw the porter; he said that
the gentleman had gone to the opera,
that lie would return later.'
"I said,,'Tell him that a lady must
speak to him immediately, when he
comes in, at - Hotel.' . I went to
the hotel, and paced the floor, burn-
ing with anxiety, till I heard his
tread ; then he came in pale as death,
and I sprang into his arms. I pushed
him from me, and told him of all his
false treachery. He said he loved me
still, he wept, he implored me on his
knees not to leave him again alone..
I said no, that I had sins enough
already on my soul, and that'I would
not commit another crime. We cried
together all night, and be prayed and
entreated, and I said never, and at
five o'clock the next morning I left
Naples. alone."'
"And this husband ?" said Ina.
Ah, Madam, I married him to
try to forget ; but somehow it all
.comes back and haunts me ever. I
used to feel mad with envy when I
saw Monsieur Emanuele speaking so
lovingly to you."
"And your children ?" -said Ina.
Sofi began to sob. Ina was sorry
she had spoken so thoughtlessly of
them.
uI don't want to think of them ;
they are well taken care of by my
husband's rich relations. My little
girl is beautiful, - I do not say it

because she is my child, but they all
say so,- people turn to look at 'her
in the street ; in Italy golden hair is
so much admired, and hers is in long
curls down to her waist,pand they say
a young prince has already spoken
for her."
" And why did you go out to ser-
vice, Sof ? "
" My husband was a poor man,
and I was wihout-a cent; and now,
Madam, I have put in your hands all
my life."
CHAPTER V.
NA   thought long that night over
poor Sofi's story ; she felt regret
that she knew that Sofi had fallen,
and yet she felt a keener interest
than ever in her little maid-of-all-
work. "Ah, how sad life is ?" said
Ina to herself, as she turned her
head on the pillow; "and, as Sofi
says, how terrible love is ! It seems
inexorable as death in its laws. The
Greeks had reason to believe in fa-
tality ; it seems indeed tp be like an
iron chain cutting into one's flesh,
and that one cannot shake off. - Ah,
poor little Sofi! you too have turned
many a night restlessly oil your pil-
low. Does the heart-ache, I wonder,
ever cease ? Would it be possible to
go on for years with this dull pain
in one's soul? It is as if suddenly
from the earth'had been taken away
all its freshness, all its glad flowers,
all its little birds, its rippling waters,
and that one low wail filed its des-
olati darkness. I had faith in Soft,
now that is gone, -in the past I
mean. I had comfort in feeling that

she'was gay and untouched by sor-
rows, and now I know her heart has
been wrung. It is well perhaps to
feel that all those we pass on the
high-road of this earth, no matter
how bright they look, have been
through the deep waters of trouble;
that would make the very brushing
of their garments against ours sa-
cred, and some sympathy would go
out from us to them. Ah, Emanuele,
if you loyed me as I do you, if you,
were half as wretched as I am with-
out you,' you could not leave me
here alone. I cannot believe in the
necessity of any false position. It
seems to me /as if all ought to be
clear as the daylight; but if I could
once say fully, wholly, through what-
ever losses, sorrows, or disappoint-
ments, so that I 'might learn to
come to our Father who is in
Heaven, then his will, his will, not
,mine, be donee but it is hard to
say,. save with the lips ; those move,
and the heart remains still. Some-
times all things seem a mockery to
me. I cannot bear nature to be so
bright, whilst I feel so immeasurably
sad !"
Time went rolling slowly on in
the little cottage. Sofi too often felt
lonely, for although, as she had said,
she had not taken this husband for
love, yet she had a, certain sort of
fondness for him, and she missed him
-too. But Sofi'sfirst feeling was devo-
tion to her mistress, and nothing on
earth would have tempted her to for-
sake her; besides, Sofi began to feel
anxious and sorry for Ina herself; she
wondered what! this mysterious, re-
lation was that existed between Ina
and Emanuele. Sofi's morals were not|

very sound upon the subject of love
-that, she thought, justified all
things,-but any other deed that
was not highland honorable was to
her perfectly abhorrent.
"I thought," said Sofi one day,
"when I first came-here, that you
and Monsieur Emanuele were lov-
ers."
"And so we were !" said Ina, with
surprise.
"No, I did not mean just that,"
said Sofi. "I meant that I thought
you were just bound together for the
time being, that - But when I cane
to know you better, and saW you
were just as innocent as, the angels
in heaven, then I began to-not
quite understand how it all was."
"You thought that ! " said Ina,
scarlet to her temples, and catching
hold of Sofi's wrist; "you thought
that of me ! How    could you love
me? how could you live with me?"
She went on, more excited every mo-
ment ; but suddenly she let go Sofi's
hand, caught her breath, and, turning
deadly pale, said, "Think what you
will of me, I care not:"
"Why, Madam, if one robbed, or
killed, or was cross and selfish, or
proud, and unkind to the poor, - if
a rich person goes around with un-
charitable feelings in the heart, that
is all a crime ; but love is a justifier
of itself. One cannot do much wrong
if one only loves. Does not the Book
of Life say that Christ said, 'Because
you have loved much, much shall be
forgiven to you'? That is a proif-
ise in itself."
"Ah, Sofi, it does not niean that
kind of love, but because the Mag-
dalene had a rich nature, and gave

from it fully to her God, after she
had sinned."
"Well, I don't, take it that way,
Madam; but they do say in Italy
dreadful things, and, they say that
Christ loved -"
"Hush!" saidIna, putting her hand
over Sofi's mouth. " Italy is a place
where there is little reverence, much
corruption, and scarcely any faith
amongst the men. What would you
have? They have seen so much that
was false, they'have sat behind the
scenes and seen the puppet-strings
pulled so often, that they laugh at
the effects produced afterwards."
"Yes; is it not awful, Madam ?
and I think that the'men's disbelief,
is better than the women's pretended
devotion and bigotry. They just
kneel there with their prayer-books
in their hands, their lips repeating
the prayer, and their. eyes wandering
all around the church, to see the
dresses of their neighbors, or to ex-
change a glance with some of those
dark-eyed, wicked men!"
"That indeed seems true," said
Ina, ",but we must not judge from
appearances."
"0, is n't it terrible, Madam, the
way those Italian men have?  They
just take you down, like a bird from
a tree, without once firing. When I
heard my officer under my window,
with his divine song, I used to feel
as if I must float down to him ; and
those letters-ah;,Madam, they would
have moved a heart of bronze !-so
full of love and death. But I do not
think they have much feeling ; it is
only with them the ' winning, and
then they throw us away like nettles
that had stung them. He called me
8

Stella, that was his star, and anima
mia, that was his soul."
Ina groaned. That was the name
that Emanuele had so often called
her by, and that had 'so rung in her
ears ; it seemed as if she heard him
now; why did she not?'She could
not bear it any longer.
"Madam," said Sofi, with a bright
fire flashing in her eyes, "if I thought
any man would be so cruel, so abject,
so base and treacherous as to deceive
you, I would not live any longer. I
am in a humble position,-I know it,
-and he is a great gentleman; yet I
would not think he was good enough
to make a mat for my feet, that I
might wipe them   on it. I would
trample on his lQve, I would kill
him," she said passionately ; and then
she continued, "Don't you fret about
him, they are not worth crying your
pretty eyes about; and besides he
loves you, and is good, we both know
it ; only I meant, if any one sh-ould
ever dare to think even of wronging
you, that he would find a man in
me; but don't you cry. Monsieur
loves . you dearly, all his actions
showed, it.; his eyes were so full of
love when they looked at you."
"I know it," said Ina, wiping her
eyes.
"And then he will come, and we
will have a splendid boy, with just
his eyes, to put in his- arms, and he
will be proud, and you will be happy,
and poor Sofi, too, not the least."
"0 Sofi, you are so good to me,"
said Ina, putting her arms around
her neck ; " why do you not kiss me,
Sofi? Sardo cannot, and -I often
wonder you do not."
"Because, Madam, I never feel

as if I were worthy to touch you.
I would give my life for you, but I
never dare touch you." -
"Well, kiss me now, dear Sofi."
Another day when they were sit-
ting silently together, Sofi suddenly
looked up and said3 "Do you know
what is the last mode, Madam ?"
" No," said Ina.
"Death, Madam,-that is the last
mode; those fine Italian ladies do
not think of that when they play
their pranks."
Ina sighed heavily.
"Do you know who is your best
friend, Madam ?"
"Emanuele," said Ina.
"No; your pocket."
" 0 Sofi, that does not sound like
you, that rings with a hard, cold,
metallic sound. I do not want you
to say those things."
"Well, Madam, -it is trpe; if you
are rich, .it is power, you can com-
mand the whole world, everybody is
at your feet; but to-morrow if you are
poor, and want a favor, there is not
one will stir a hand for you; if you
were rich, to-morrow you could start
for Turin, and be with Monsieur
Emanuele, and he would give you a
warmer welcome too if you came in
your own coach."
"0, do not say so, Sofi; it is
false."
"I did not mean that he would
love you any better, but somehow
wealth is a great dazzle, and it buys
a great deal of respect."'
"It does not buy loe," said Ina,
"and it does not buy admission to
the other world." -    -
"No, Madam; the 13ook of Life
says that we brought nothing into

this world, and{we can take nothing
out; that is an awful thought, I
often used to say to Victor Emanuel."
Ina smiled.
"Indeed, Madam, I have talked to
him many a time, when we were in
the Tyrolian Alps, with our soldiers;
he is just as natural and easy as a
man can be. Why, I was more afraid
of Monsieur Emanuele than I ever
was of his Majesty; he spoke to me
in English, and I used to say to him,
'How can you wear your gold sceptre
and chain and crown, and fling away
so much money ?' and he would an-
swer, just in these words, 'My dear,
I cannot put a loaf of bread in every-
body's mouth,' and indeed he is gen-
erous with his money. I said to him,
one day, 'How can you lead such a
wicked life ?' and he said it would
be wicked to steal or rob, but that
love was not wrong, and then he
would touch me under the chin, and
call me his beautiful blonde; but
when I heard that, I said, 'Business
first, your Majesty, and then love,'
and I ran away to the sick soldiers.
If you should ever go to his pal-
ace and speak with him, tell him of
the English blonde in the Tyrol, and
he will tell you that he remembers
me, I am sure."
Ina had not had a letter for a
week ; she had written every day,
and was beginning to feel such dull
despair as she knew not how to con-
quer. Sometimes she would think
that she would take the cars and go
to him, that was the quickest. way,
that was the only hope and help;
then she would say to herself, hope-
lessly, " But where shall .I go ? I
dare not go to the Benonis, and be-

sides," she remembered, with the
cold drops starting on her brow,
"they would turn me from the door
if they saw me now ; and he -    0,
if I should arrive at his room  and
he should look angrily at me I
should go mad !"   The days went
on slowly, slowly dragged the heavy
hours. " If I should not have a let-
ter!" ever went whirring round like
a wheel in her head, "if I should
not hear !"  Thousands of times she
had looked at her watch, and now
she called Sofi with a voice in which
there was no life, and said, " Come,
Sofi, come, Sardo, let us go to the
mail; it is time now !"
"God bless your heart !" said Sofi ;
"if I could write it with my blood,
and make it come from him, I would
do it."  ,
They went to the- post-office, and
to Sofi's inquiry there came a letter.
0, how Ina's eyes were dimmed
and her lips parched ! A letter for
her! yes, it was there at last. She
held it listlessly in her hand, there
was no rebound ; she had suffered
so for that, letter that her heart
could not be'glad.
"Are you not going to open it ?"
said Sofi.
"Yes," said Ina, "by and by."
She waited until she arrived again
at her little home, and then she went
up to her room and shut the door,
and opened her letter ; it ran thus:
"Carissima Ina, - I have received
all your little winged messengers,
and have kissed them for your sake.
My heart has been often with you
in the little home, but you must par-
don me, my love, if I did not write;
mhy time has been so completely

crowded with business that I have
not had a moment that I could call
my own. I have news to tell you
that will flush your cheek with joy
and pride, I know, for your friend.
Day before yesterday the King gave
a great dinner ; and he rose from his
seat after dinner, and came to where
I sat, and placed the broad green
ribbon with the high decoration of
officer on ittaround my shoulder. I
said, 'I do not desire, your Majesty
knows, these badges of your kingly
favor.' The King laughed, and said,
'I should like to see any man refuse
an honor at my hands'; and that
evening I was nominated by him
prime minister, and yesterday the
nomination was confirmed by the
Chamber,- so you see, my Ina, that
I am not in disgrace. I shall have
less time to write you than ever;
my star is in the horizon, I do not
mean to let it descend, but the
statesman forgets not the sweetest
part of life, and therefore he bears as
a talisman his Ina in his heart.
Farewell, my love.          B."
Emanuele never signed himself
save with his last initial when writ-
ing to Ina. She read and reread
his letter, then she threw herself
sobbing upon her knees ; there Sofi
found her.
"Why, what is the matter ?" said
Sofi, running in fright to her.
"0 'Sofi, the King has named
him minister, is not that dreadful?"
"Why," said Sofi, "is that what
my 'heart is crying for ? -That is
power, wealth, position,-- do you
not see it ? Now all will be smootht
waters; he will make you his wife."
"What," said Ina, "again those

words ! ",and she -sprang to her feet,
her eyes darting quick flames, and
then turned away her head and said,
"Do not be frightened, little Sofi; I
have such a fiery temper, I forgot
myself!"
" I meant," said Sofi, " then he will
send for you, and all will be right,
and you will be happy again.",
SIna shook her head. " He did not
say anything about it in his letter."
" He did not have time to crowd
in everything, but you will see that
it will be so; now cheer up for an-
other's sake.. Why, our boy will
be a'very sad little. fellow, and we
shall never have a good night's rest
with him, if you do not take. things
more quietly."
Ina smiled, and said, "Well, Sofi,
I will try to look on the. bright side
for his sake, but it is hard some-
times ! But if I feel very ill I will
send for him; do - you think he.
would come?"
" Of course he would," said Sofi,
not daring to discourage her mistress.
The days at last will go by, weary
and long as they seem at the begin-
ning ; and autumn had set into win-
ter, and the Alps looked dull and
dreary enough. Ina felt as if they
lay all day on.her heart, and that she
should never breathe freely until she
was on the other side of them, they
threw such great shadows on the
plains, and seemed, now the sun did
not shine, to wrap all the earth in
darkness.
" I feel very ill," said  a, looking
up plaintively into Soft's face ; " do
you think I might write and say so?"
" Certainly," said Soft, and Ina
wrote:-         .-

"0 my beloved, what can I say to
you that I have not said ? I stretch
out my arms to you, and the shadow
of your greatness mocks them; my
soul is so weary, my heart so dull,
myself so changed, that perhaps you
would not love me as you used. 0
Emanuele, I only long to see you; I
am ill, I fear my hour has come, and
you are not near me. 0 my husband,"
-  that wor   was erased, and care-
fully scratel d out, and "lover " sub-
stituted, - "0  my lover of former
days, come ; ever my soul repeats
that dreary lay. Farewell. All yours
unto death. Ina."
And that night Ina came like a
spectre, in her long white dressing.
gown, to Sofi's bedside, and called'
her to come to h'er. They were all
alone, these two women, and yet Sofi
never shrank from any act where
energy and courage were to be dis-
played ; she slipped on her clothes
and said to Ina, "You go to bed, I
will not be gone a moment."
"0, do not leave me alone, Sofi; I
shall die."
"I must go for the doctor, dearest,
and you must be calm."
Sofi had a wonderful power over
Ina, and she let herself be guided by
her in all things ; it was just ten
minutes that Sofi was gone, but to
Ina it seemed hours,' and she returned
with the physician.
That night Soft telegraphed to Tu-
rin : " All well, -- the'little boy and
his mother."
She hated Emanuele Bertani now,
and only did it for Ina's sake.
Ina, lay whiter than the sheets
around her, and sleeping by her side
was a little boy, with dark eyes, that

he had opened long enough for Soft
to discover their color. Ina was
told she must rest, but she could not.
She lay wondering what' she should
call the little stranger; deeply as £he
loved her husband, she had suffered
so much of late that his name seemed
to her to have something fatal in it.
She wondered if he whom she loved so
much, the father of her darling, would
love him too, when they should live
all together. Somehow her heart felt'
less like marble since the little child
was actually there, a palpable thing,
by her side ; it seemed to her as if it
drew her nearer to Emanuele, as if
now the secret must cease to be, and
he would come and take her to a
new home, his wife before all the
world; then the clouds would roll
back and all her heaven was bright,
and her little cherub looking down
from it all dimples and smiles.
Sofi," she said, " are you there ? "
"No," said Sofi; "you must not
talk."
"But you are there," said Ina,
laughing. Ah, how pleasant it sound-
ed to Sofi's ear ! it almost frightened
her for a moment ; it was so long
since she had heard Ina laugh, she
thought she was wandering in her
mind. She went up ' to the bed,
and bent anxiously over her lady, and
stroked back her hair, to see if she
had any fever. Inalooked up brightly
in her face, and said: " Sofi, I feel
better than I have in months.
think I shall be happy now ; he will
come."
And she closed her eyes and slept.
A telegram" arrived, and it said,
"I greet the young mother ; keep me
informed of all things. B." -

Two days more and a letter came;
it said : " My beloved Ina, God bless
you! They have sent me word that
you are a mother ; the electric chords
have played upon my heart, and told
me many sweet things. Take care of
yourself, there are three now bound
in one life ; this is the. only Trinity.
When you are well enough you will
come to Turin ; I must clasp you to
me, I must kiss the hem of the young
mother's garments, I must whisper in
her ear a thousand things that she
has already heard, but she will blush
as of old at the low tones of her lover.
I cannot come ; would that I could'
cast Italy behind me, and free myself
from the incubus of work ! but a cap-
tain, however unworthy, yet must be
where his ship is, guiding and guard-
ing her from the shoals of disaster.
To-day we have three different sedu-
tos, so you must pardon my haste. I
must satisfy them all, the - king, the
ministry, the chambers, and the peo-
ple, -0 herculean labor ! Farewell,
sweet Ina."
There was no initial, no signature
at all; Ina missed it, but she was hap-
py again, she should see him soon,
for the first time his letter spoke of
it since he left; he had told her to
come, and in that strengthening hope
she should get well; and she pressed
her baby's tiny hands to her cheek,
and she looked lovingly into its dim-
ples, and he seemed the image to her
of her husband. The doctor had said
that Ina must not nurse her child,
and vith great sorrow she was obliged
to give up .this cherished desire. Soft
said she would not have another wo-
man in the house, for she knew that
Monsieur Emanuele would not much

relish that idea, although she did not
tell Ina so; but she determined her-
self to bring it up by hand, and she
and Ina talked over all things togeth-
er, and at last they decided that Sofi
should send for her husband, that he
should help her to do all the work, -
Sofi had often told her how he could
'cook, and wash Sardo, and dust, -~and
then she would take sole care of her
mistress and the baby. She sent for
him to come, and they were expect-
ing him every day. Ina could not
'write now to Emanuele, but his let-
ters were more frequent than before,
and he always spoke of seeing Ina
soon, and this kept up her courage ;
and then there was the baby to do
for; he required constant attendance,
his cries had to be stilled, he was
something to love, to caress, to live
for, and Ina's life was fuller now.
She hung over her baby with such a
look in her face often, that Sofi said
she looked more like the Madonna
than ever before.
"0 my baby," she would say, "you
have come like a rainbow with colors
of hope and promise. I will call him
Theodore, Sofi, gift of God; will not
that be a pretty name? Once Eman-
uele said he should have his name
with Victor before it, then it would
be for him and for the King ; but my
baby shall never be called by the
King's name, not even to please my
beloved husband ; 'anything else I
will do for him"; and then she took
him in her arms and covered him
with kisses.
"0 Sofi, will not his father be
proudj of him ? will it not be a blessed
mome t when I place him in his
arms ?"'

One day as she lay on her sofa,
which had been wheeled up to the
window, Sofi had just brought in the
.mail; there was no letter from her
husband. Ina turned away with dis-
appointment and opened the paper
in hopes at least of seeing some men-
tion of his name there, when sud-
denly Sofi heard her utter a low cry
of pleasure.                ,
"What is it, Madam? Has Signor
Emanuele got some new honors ?".
0 no, Sofi, better than that," and
the tears rushed into her eyes, and
she stooped down and kissed the
place on the paper where she was
reading; "but my Princess has a
little son too. 0, how often have I
thought of her since I first pressed
my darling to my heart ! how many
times have I wondered if she had any
such sweet hopes ! It was but yes-
terday that the little Prince was born,
ushered into the world with bells
ringing and cannons sounding, and
the people, it says, made an arch of
roses under which the little prince
was to be carried to the chapel of
the Princess for its baptism, and it
was written in flowers, 'Welcome our
Prince!' 0 yes, he is loved for her
sake !. I have ne er taken off my
bracelet since s e first gave it me.
Sweet Princess, how I wish I could
come and give one kiss to you, and
one to your little boy ! she would be
glad, Sofi, if she knew that I was hap-
py too. . How strange it all is; I feel
as if I could see her in her room,
lying amongst her lace sheets on her
grand bed, with a crown carved over
it, a gentle smile of peace on her face.
-I am afraid they have taken away
the child, that the etiquette of the

court will not allow it to lie there
and comfort her eyes ; but no matter,
she is a mother. I wonder if in all
the excitement she has ever thought
of her little German friend. I did of
her; that was strange, but when.you
said it was a boy I thought of the
Princess. I will send a kiss through
the air, and she will feel it, and it
will tell her all."
The next day Ina had a letter from
her husband; it said: "Ina, mia bella,
when will you come to me ? are you
not strong enough already?  I think
it is time to give up the little house
in the Alps, you will become a snow-
bird else. The baby you will leave
with Sofi; she will take admirable-
care of him, so that your mother's
heart will feel no anxiety ; she will
be to him as good as you could be,
for she is all fidelity and affection. I
have spoken to the B       's, they
would be only too glad to have y'ou
back again; they have written you
twice to know -if you could return,
and are surprised that you have igt
answered them. I told them that
your brother had taken up all your
time, but that now he was better.
When will you come ? My expenses
are very heavy, there are great de-
mands upon me in -my present posi-
tion, and I think it would be better
if therefore you put Sofi to board in
some simple house for the present at
Lucerne, where we can go to her
in the summer months : you must
choose a pleasant place with a beau-
tiful view. I long to see the boy,
but as yet have no breathing time.
.Write me that you will come soon. I
will meet you at the station at any
time you write, but come you must.

I cannot do longer without my be-
loved. Yours as ever."
Ina held the letter convulsively
cramped 'in her hand. Had it come to
this? was this the end of the bright
vista that had opened to her? She
could not even weep. What !no home,
-nor here, nor there. She could
not believe even her eyes, -she re-
read his letter, and then she sat down
alone in her misery. What did it all
mean ? Other ministers had wives ;
why did Emanuele ,so shrink from
showing hid ? Surely he was not
ashamed of her ! and the blood
rushed to her face.
Did he not love her ? No, that was
impossible, and she wiped away the
scalding tears that fell. Every word,
tone, look, had been that of passion-
ate love.  Was he poor? had he
fouhd himself embarrassed by debts
before his marriage ? Ah, she was
willing to work, to toil for him,-
glad and proud to do it; but let it be
openly done, not as a work of shame.
Was there another, not loved now
but once long before, to whom he
held himself in honor bound? and
Ina's heart almost ceased to beat at
the mere thought of such misery.
What was it that should tempt
Emanuele to let her go back under a
feigned name, in a false position, to her
former life? He had so often said,
too, that when she was his wife she
should not ever again earn her own
bread ; all should be from, 'him to
her ! and Ina's mind kept recalling
every most trifling 'ford that, had
ever passed between them, every
mninutest action of his ; still she
could find no explanation of his con-
duct. "I love him," she said in her

not that I am afraid of him, but I
fear to lose his love, - and why
should I fear to lose any love, save
through a fault of my own? 0 God,
give me, that strength, that I may
seek only to do right myself to others.
We must each learn to walk alone;
that is what I never have been able
to do, and perhaps this ,trial is sent
me, just to teach me this lesson of
strength. Ah, Emanuele, Emanuele !
it is not well to give so much pain.
Do you know how your Ina's heart
is bleeding?  Yes, I will go to him.
I will put it all fearlessly before his
eyes, for the sake now of another life
that is more than mine, and he will
take 'me in his arms, close to him,
and all will be forgiven, all forgot-
ten."
Ina felt a natural pride that not
Sofi nor any one on earth should
know' she had one doubt of him ;
she could accuse him in her inmost
soul of thoughtlessness, nothing
much worse, but she would not let
Sofi know that there was one ripple
on her waters. Sofl should not say
one harsh word of him, think one

r She had such a quick, Penetrating

CHAPTER VI.
TNA     was growing stronger, and
islh    knew  the time was near
when she must break to Sofi her
plans for the future. Go to him she
would, at all hazards, and yet there
was her baby lying in her arms,
unconscious of all the storms in the
heart of her who bent over him with
so much love; 'her baby, one little
pure drop of the tempest that was
sweeping over her, how could she
leave him.? She was beginning to
feel a nightmare uncertainty creep
into her life ; it seemed an inextrica-
ble labyrinth in which she was going
to lose herself ; how should she ever
get out of it ?, and she thought of
the story, which haunted her as a
young girl, of the walls which grad-
ually, slowly, but surely, closed in on
one until they crushed out 'the life
that was beating in the heartL How
should she ever get back to her baby
if once she left him ? how ever break
away from her new place if once
she went voluntarily and accepted

it? She felt a strange superstition,
too, in leaving the little cottage of
her newly wedded love empty. If
she could have always thought of
Soi and her baby there, she should
have seen them ever just as she left
then,; but in a new place, a house
which was not a home, where there
were no associations, no memories,
it seemed as if she were cutting
loose from everything in the world.
If she could have fallen on Sofi's
neck, and cried out on her faithful
breast all her troubles, it would have
been a relief ; but she must bear this
heavy load all alone. ".Alone," she
said, " alone we come into this
world, alone we must leave it, and
we must suffer alone ; no one can
ever bear our burden for us, it is the
inevitable lot to walk alone ; even
amongst crowds of admiring and lov-
ing friends, the heart sits alone, afar
from all, counting over its sorrows,
as the weary fingers of some desolate
monk pass silently over the beads
of his rosary."
"0   Madam," said Sofi, " is he
not lovely ? He begins to smile, and
it looks just like the water when
you throw a tiny flower into it, and
it' makes a thousand little waves, -
for he seems to be laughing all over.
Alh, it is always the Book of Life that
speaks the truth, and te  one every-
thing ! it says that a  oman forget-
teth her sorrow and rejoices only
because unto her a male child is
born,   d- so it is.  Come and see
him, M  dam, it will do your heart
good ; make a picture of yourself in
lhis eye, and see how. sweet it looks.
I wish Monsieur Emanuele could see
hi now"

This was a good time, Ina thought,
to begin; soshe said: "Sofi, I think
it would be best to think now some-
what of giving up the little home,
now that your husband is here ; he
will be a great help to us. I remem-
ber Monsieur Emanuele said that he
took it by the month, so we shall 'be
free at the end of January. Do you
not think," she said appealingly, for-
getting her projects of independence,
and falling back on her natural habit
of leaning on Sofi, - do you not
think it would be a good plan?"
" I think," said Sofi, " it would be
the best plan in the world. So,"
she said, talking to the baby caress-
ingly, and almost smothering it with
her face, " we will shut up the
little love - cottage, and some day,
when you are a man, we will come
here, and I shall be leaning on your
arm, and you will say, 'Sofi, tell me
just where you used to live with my
beloved mother and father,'.and I
shall say, 'Here, dear, in this nest
among the roses, and your mother
was the sweetest rose of all.'"
Ina looked sadly at her; she had
not the courage to speak, she was
afraid she should choke, so she sat
silent again.
" Well, Madam," said Sofi, present-
ly, " I think it will be pleasant to,-be
again in -the city. I often used to
think at night, suppose an ava-
lanche were to slide down and cover
us up, and that Monsieur Emanuele
were to come to find us, and should
see the snow in a great mound like
a marble vault, and our tomb would
be inside ! and it used to make me
shiver ; it was lonesome here, al-
though I never would say it to you

before, but I shall be so glad to loo]
out of the windows, and see the street
lighted with gas. I was afraid i
would make the baby gloomy ti
show him always the stars."
"But, Sofi, suppose I did not tak
you with me."
"Ah, I am not afraid that you
would abandon me, Maam; you
wsnt to try me as God did Abra
ham."
"No; but, Sofi, if I should leav
my little Isaac here," said Ina, try-
ing to smile, and feeling a strange
choking sensation in her throat. "I
almost have thought lately that it
would be best for me to go first, to
look up here some boarding-place in
the mean' time for you and baby,
and'- and," she said, hesitating,
"perhaps I might go in the mean
time to the ,Benonis, and take my
former place, and from there see
what I could find in the way of an
apartment for us all." She had said
the worst now, and she felt relieved
that it was told ; but she was not pre-
pared for Sofi's manner of taking it.
Sofi's face was crimson, and her eyes
were dancing with the rage that she
knew not how to express.
"Madam," she' said at last, "take
that back!1 it' was not you that
spoke, it never came from you! I
know well who it was, it was Mon-
sieur Emanuele. , He is an Italian,
I always knew it, nothing better,
with his winning, treacherous ways ;
with those large dark eyes, that look
all love, and are all deceit; with
his low sweet voice that covers his
anger just as a flower does- a snake ;
with-"
"Sofi!" said Ina, looking .at her

k in blank astonishment, but Sofi did
s not listen now.
t   "With his fascinations, and his
o eloquence," -she went on, "O, they
would rob the soul of any woman!
e We women only see the soft, bright
feathers of the dart that is aimed at
1 our poor hearts ; we only see the
I smiling figure of Love ! we do not
- stop to look behind, at the yinss
that will fly away with it soon!
Ah, Madam!" and she clenched her
- hands and teeth, "if I could see him
now, I would hurl his own baby in
C his face !"
" Sofi," said Ina, "are you mad?"
" No, I am not," said Sofi; " I wish
I were, I should like to bite him."
" I cannot listen to you, Sofi, if
you speak thus; you must leave me
until you can calm yourself ; I am not
now in a mood tp hear such words."
Sofi went up to the bed, and,
* placing the child gently amongst
the pillows, left the room without
speaking again; then Ina covered
her face with her hands and wept
bitterly.
It was the first evening that Ina
and Sofi had ever separated without
sitting together and saying good
night.-  Sofi would willingly have
come into the room, but she felt that
she had offended Ina too deeply.
Ina's heart yearned *for Sofi, and she
would have forgiven her even her
anger against Emanuele, but she.felt
that for his sake she ought to take
all this project upon herself, and
she wished that Sofi should feel that
alL her indignation was due to her-
self, and not to. him. So they both
went to bed that~ night very misera-
ble, and they neither of them slept

at all. Early in the morning Ina
heard some one crying at her door.
" Come in, Sofi," she said gently.
And Sofi cane in, and sobbed out :
"0 Madam! I have been so miser-
able, I have not closed my eyes. I
wanted to come to you, and to my
own precious little treasure, but' I
dared not; I thought you might be
asleep. I remembered what the great
Book, says, that '"a soft answer turn-
eth away wrath,' and I thought if I
had spoken gently when I went out
of the door, you would not have
been angry ; but I could not then. I
never saw you angry before," she
said,, still crying like a child, "and
it hurt me ; but I promise you, Mad-
am, never again, so long as I live, to
speak against any one you love, and
you must promise me in return to
forget that I ever did so."
"iI will, I do," said Ina, crying too ;
"and now, Sofi, let us forget the past,
and come and sit down, and listen to
my plans, and help me form them.
I cannot, as you know, continue to
stay here always alone. Monsieur
Emanuele is so entirely occupied by
his carder that he cannot come ; that
is very natural; you know a minis-
ter could not stay in Lucerne, it
would be foolish even to expect it.
He wants me to come to him, and I
long with all my soul to see him,
-Sofi, and," she said, hesitating and
turning away her head so that Sofi
should not see the blood that was
rushing to her temples, "would it
not be best for me to go myself, to
take my place, for a short time, at
Madam Benoni's, which is always
open to me, and then I could be
near him, and ready to send you

word to come at any moment ; would.
it not be best so, Sofi ? " she said in
a low;pleading voice. "Do comfort
me, Sofi; do encourage me, to take
this step alone; you know I so lean
on you, dear."
Sofi was struggling with the indig-
nation in her heart which was fer-
menting there, all ready to break
forth again ; but she remembered her
promise so newly made, and she said:
"Well, Madam, you must do what
you think right. I would trust you
in everything in life, and you know
they do say,'nothing venture, nothing
have.' Help yourself and God will
help you, - that is what I always said
to those lazy Italian poor, who used
to come whining arom, not willing
to do a thing for then elves; they
seemed to think that they could just
lie down and open their mouths, and
something must drop into them."
"But, Sofi," said Ina, with a quiv-
ering lip, "how can I be separated
from baby ? Ah, my heart is torn in
two: whichever way I turn, I leave
it rent behind me. What shall I
do ?" she said helplessly. "I used
to think I had some strength to act,
but now I do not seem ever to know
what to do. Help me, Sofi 1"
"Yes," said Sofi, with sudden cour-
age, "you shall go, that is best; when
he sqes your sweet face, he will do
anything you ask. So you go, dear-
est, and I will see to baby as if I
were his own mother ; and then you
will be telegraphing me to come, and
it will be better then not to have the
house, because so we shall be freer
to move, and that will be one chain
broken that binds us here. You
must look at the bright side of all

things, Madam, and above all do not
fret, so that he shall not. find you
dull and changed ; there is nothing
men hate so as to have women low-
spirited, and even when you feel
your heart is breaking, you must
keep up .a smiling face before them,
or they will fly off like the butter-
flies to sun themselves in another
flower : remember this, Madam, when
Sofi is not there to tell you anything.",
"I will nott forget it, Sofi, I will
try to follow all jo  good advice ;
but how shall I 4o about news from
you? Ah, if you could only write !
it seems as if that was too terrible,
not to hear your voice at all, not
even to hear you speaking to me
through the silent paper."
"My husband shall write to you
every day, Madam, and we will tell
you together about the little one, and
all will be well; only keep up your
spirits."
("I will try, Sofi; I will do all I
can."
Sofi and Ina went out every day
to try to find a comfortable situation
for herself and the child. One place
was too damp, another had no sun-
light, anotheirwas too much exposed
to the sharp alpine winds ; but at
length Ina found a position that she
thought would do. She- felt, even
though leaving her baby with Sofi,
as if she were making a little bark of
bulrushes for it, and shoving it out
on the stream of life all alone. ' Sofi
was the sister that should watch her
darling float from the shore. It was
decided that in another fortnight
they should part; .whenever she
thought with a quick joy of the time
when he would be near her again,

then came a sharp pang of grief at
the thought of what she left here,
She felt she had a double duty, and
she scarcely knew where it lay, her
husband, her first love, in whom all
her soul was wrapt; and the little new.
born love, that lay unconscious of
the struggles it had wakened in her
heart. - One day as she sat sadly
thinking of all these things, over and
over revolving them in her mind,--
she was looking dreamily into the fire
before her, the baby was lying on her
knee, one .little shoe lay on the floor,
and its tiny rosy foot held in its
mother's hand to keep it warm, --as
they sat thus, Ina was startled-by a
loud knock at the door. Her heart
fluttered like a bird with sudden
hope; she half rose hastily, and held
by the chair to keep herself froh fall-
ing ; it was the first time since she
first entered the cottage that she
had heard that sound, save when
they were expecting the doctor, and
he had long since ceased his visits,
for Sofi and she had lived there in
utter seclusion. Ah, if it should be
he ! but no, that was too much hap-
piness to look for, and the color
that had mounted to her cheeks left
them pale as the snow on the Alps;
she had not the strength to take one
step forwards, and she heard Sofi
hurrying through the entry.
A strong, clear voice, heard through
the closed -door of the parlor, said in
German, "Does Miss Strohling live
here ? "
"Who, sir?"
"Miss Strdhling" was. the. an-
swer, in cold, clear-cut tones. They
knocked on Ina's heart like marble
balls hurled at it. She did not stir,

NA.

one hand was still holding for sup-
port on to her chair, the other
clasped her child half under her
clap
arm. "I wish to see her," the ,voice
said authoritatively- "where is she?"'
na heard Sofisay,-she knew the
feigned courage in her tones, -" She
is not well, sir, and does not see any
one."
"She will see me," said the hard,
stern voice again, and Ina heard a
heavy step approaching the door.
where should she fly? -She looked
wildly around, there was no room for
escape ;she held her baby convul-
sively close to her, and stood, her
eyes flashing, facing steadfastly the
door; she saw it open, and there he
stood before her,-a strong-looking
ma, with broad, square shoulders,
with a quiet look of intense firm-
ness about his face, light hair, clear,
trustful, blue eyes, -he looked the
very type of a true German. He
came slo ly forward, and then, tak-
ing a chair just opposite Ina, sat
down, and, shading his eyes with his
hand, said in a low voice, "Ina,
speak !"  There was perfect silence
in the room. Ina looked at the door,
which was open still, aid in which
Sofi stood with her' arms stretched,
out, her eyes wide open, like an
eagle ready to pounce ipon her prey.
Ina made a slight motion with her
hand for her to go,. and shut the
door; she gave one more look, as
if to say, "Are you perfectly safe
alone ?"  Ina did not answer her
look, but she made the same move-
ment with her hand, this time with
a slight gesture of impatience.
Sofi disapeared, and closed the
door after her ; they were alone.

"Ina, speak !" he repeated,' still
without looking at her ; "have you
nothing to say? why are you here?
alone ? why have I not heard from
you in so many months?"
There was no answer; then in a
hoarse voice,-he said, "Whose is that
child?"
"It is mine," said Ina, in a whis-
per that was clearer than her own
voice, and seemed to sound distinct-
ly through the room, as if she had
spoken aloud.
" Whose name do you bear?" he
said, suddenly uncovering his eyes,
and looking at Ina.
- "My own," she gid, now in her
own voice, and meeting his look full
in the eyes.
"And mine?" he said, without
moving a muscle of his ,face.
"They are the same," she said,
sadly.
His head dropped as if, a flash of
lightning had suddenly blasted him.
Ina moved hastily towards him; she
was frightened.
"'My brother," she exclaimed, "for
God's sake, look up!"
He motioned for her not to ap-
proach nearer to-him, but did not
otherwise stir.- Ina rushed hastily
to the door. "Sofi!" she screamed,
and her voice .seemed to shriek, as
if she no longer had any control over
it. Sofi came running at her call.
"Take my child," she said, wringing
her hands, and not seeming to know
what to do. "Give me some water,
and then go, r and leave us alone ."
*Sofi ran for the water, handdi
to her, took the child, and went up
stairs alone. She trusted na so en-
tirely that she had no tough in,

her own mind as to whether it was
right to leave her so alone with a
stranger ; she was only filled with
a strange wonder and awe.   D
Ina went back and stood near him,
handing him the water, but not dar-
ing to touch him.
He spoke slowly, as.if every word
he said hurt him, and with his head
still down.
"'You were an orphan, with their
names who are in the grave to up-
holdl, to revere, and to keep sacred;
how have you held your holy trust?
We were alone, and I had but you
to love; where is the sweet thing I
used to call by the name of sister?
You are fallen so low that I dare not
look at you ! Here are even the
letters of those to whom I intrusted
you; they believe that you are with
your sick brother,-sick indeed at
heart, even unto death, but with no
need of one so false- to tend him.
They-were not mine, it is true; I
did not. open them until there came
a despatch from them, and then,
through fear of .some great mishap,
I unsealed them. I went to Turin,
and tracked you here, how, it mat-
ters not to tell. I have found you,
- would to God that I had lost you
forever ! that you were lying in the
dull earth, hidden from all the world !
Would to God that you had died
when they went, and I had been left
alone ! I thanked him for you then,,
little knowing that I should live to
curse you !"  He paused, and then
continued, " And' not one word, not
one look of sorrow ! only defiance in
your face met my eyes on entering
the room. By what name shall I
call you ? sister is hushed forever

INA.                         47

between us, Ina you are no longer
and their name you cannot bear."
"Wilhelm," said Ina, with such a
sweet, low  accent that it - seemed
as if he could not bear it, for he
groaned, -"Wilhelm, brother at least
of former days, I did not think to
meet you thus; you have thrown
scorn upon my head, and shame.
You knew your Ina; she grew up
with you, under your faithful care;
could you think that I had forgotten
all? could you throw me from you
without one word from    my lips?
have you no faith in purity and
truth  and  innocence? could you
not trust me against all the world?
then your love was not a brother's.
Wilhelm, I cannot let you.go from
me so, it would kill me ! I do not
know to whom I do most wrong. I
am bound by a sacred promise to
hold this secret ; but I think of our
dead mother, I see her face between
us, and I cannot let you leave me
without one word of comfort. I am
not the thing you hold me to be,-
o God ! how could you wrong me
so ? Iam 'a true and honorable wife.
More than that you must not ask
I can look into my child's eyes,-and
pray for him to God, but to no one
save you can I reveal at present
what I have told you."
" And you are willing to live thus,
openly thought to be by the world
what you are not ? to be held to be
such a thing that women will gather
in their skirts that they may not
brush against you passing. and yo
love the man who can subject youit
such shame ? you honor him miore
than your honor ? What cause ca
teebe that he should not proudly

claim you as his wife ? you - dare so
wrong your parents' memory, your
brother's name, your own womanly
nature ! Ina," he laid, coming up to
her, and looking at her with terrible
anger in' his ,clear blue eyes, "tell
me his name, that I may not be
ashamed of my sister ; you shall bear
it openly before the sun, and bright
as that, or you will die dishonored."
"Never," said Ina, "shall you hear
it from my lips until he freely tells
me that I may speak. I love him
dearer than ife," drawing herself up
before her brother, and throwing
back her head proudly; "I love him,
he is my   usband, and he will not
wrong me !"' Then suddenly, as she
looked at ira, his whole form so
bowed down with trouble, a sense of
pity came. over her' ftr him, she for-
got his harsh severity towards her,
and she said gently, "Wilhelm, doJ
not despise me nor him; .it will notI
be long, dea brother, before all will
be right; trust me."
But her  other's face had become
deadly pale ; he turned slowly and
said betwe n his teeth, "Ina, he I
shall either right you or die like a,
dog." He turned to go.
Wilhelm," she said in an ago- t
nized voice, and throwing herself be--
fore him, "you know how timid I am, 1
you think to terrify me into speak-1
ing, you think I am the coward still
that I used to be; take back those t
words ! You. cannot frighten me,
but you shall not go until you unsayc
what you have said. 0, remember
when Iwas but a child at 'your knee,t
and you were sp tender of me ! and i
I as left to your charge. Do not t
break my heart ! I shall die," she t

said in despair, growing hoarse as she
spoke, and sinking into her chair
wearied out by her passion, which
had fallen on him as if he were of
marble'; he did not speak one word,
but moved-again toward the door.
"Speak to me," she said, rising;
"speak to me, Wilhelm."
"I have spoken," he said, and he
left the room. Ina heard the door
close after him, then the entry door,
and she could not move; she At as
if her limbs were made of stone.
Sofi hurried down stairs the instant
she heard the door shut.
"0 Sofi," saidIna, "are you come?"
and she threw her arms around her
neck and burst into tears; this was a
relief to her. "It was my brother,
Sofi; and he said, if all was not
right, he would kill him."
"Don't you mind," said Sofi, sooth-
ing her as if she were a child. "0,
how  I hate these men! I wish we
could .go where we never again should
see one of their detested faces. Don't
you see he only said it to frighten
you ? he does not know Monsieur
Emanuele, and besides all will be
right; in a few days you will be with
him, and he will not refuse you any-
thing, -he cannot ! You know one
word, when you are there, will be"
better than thousands written to
him. I dreaded so your goig and
now I shall be almost glad when the
tume comes ! They see you are alone,
and they take advantage, like "brutes,
of your weakness ; but you must not
give them  the victory by showing

be cast down by any man; we can
live without them all!".
"0 Sofh," said Ina, "you always
comfort me. What is it that makes
mne lean on such a fragile little crea-
ture for strength ? I do not know
what I should have done without
you, I do -not think I could have
bore my troubles without you ; you
ha e-been everything to me; how
can I ever repay you ?"
"1ie only thing I desire is to see
you with the sweet, smiling face I
used to see, to ,see you happy again,
and then, I often think when I go to
bed, at night, I should not mind
dying."
Ina was glad now to leave the little
house, for she felt as if a shadow lay
on it; both she and Sofi would feel
{etter now to go away, for there she
seemed always to see her brother be-
fore her eyes, just as he looked when
he said those terrible words ! She
breathed freer whenever she was in
the open air, anywhere away from
the cottage which she, once loved so
much. The day at last came when
she was to say a final farewell to the
early home of her love; she and Sofi,
with Sofi's husband and the baby, all
went together. After they had left,
the house, Ina said, " Wait, Sofi, one
moment !" and she ran back, threw
open the window in her room, and
kissed the vine which once shaded
it with roses they were dead now,
and the vine\ was'leafless, all but a
few little yellow crumpled leaves that
the cold winter had4left there as if in
inockery of the Qhanges he -could
make. Ing gathered 'them hastily,
and thrust them into her bosom.
" IThey seem to me a picture of my

own heart,". she said bitterly, and
then hastened back. to join Sofi,
They found their new rooms very
comfortable; it was a consolation to
Ina before leaving Lucerne to know,
that her darling was in a good place,
and that she could stay with him
there a few days, so that, when ab-
sent, she could picture Sofi to herself
with him,. and all their surroundings,
She had written to the Benonis that
by "some accident she had not re-
ceived their letters until lately, that
she accepted with gratitude their
offer to let her return to them, and '
she had written to her husband to
meet her on the following Monday
at Turin ; and now the long night-
mare was vanishing away, and she
felt that the time was near when she
should really se'e him again.
CHAPTER     VII.
SUNDAY was passed by Ina and
Sofi in arranging Ina's trunks
and settling all things'before her de-
parture.
" Sofi," said Ina, her voice a little
tremulous, ".I do not want you to
cry when I go' away, and I do not
want anybody to be .with me, only
you. Gabriele must stay with the
baby until you come back from the
station; and, Sofi, you will never leave
him alone, nor let him cry, and kiss
him  every day for me, and tell him
how I love him, - won't you,' Soil?
I think he will understand it, just as
whi the wind whispers to the
flowers, - and, Sofi dear, you will
promise that I shall have a letter

every day; you will dictate it and
Gabriele will. write it, but I want it
all in your own words. I know you
will love him just as if it were I my-
self that wa near him.  Dear Sofi, I
love you so truly, I feel so grateful
to you."
"Please do not talk so, Madam;
you take away all my courage."
"Well, Sofi, let us try and make
each other strong.  I will not say an-
other word; you understand every-
thing as if it had been said."
So they both went silently on with
their preparations, not daring either
of them to speak the thoughts that
were in their hearts. All that night
Ina sat by her baby's cradle, looking
down into his closely shut eyes,
watching the shadows as they passed
over his little face, and then stooping
gently to kiss him, -so gently, that
she might not wake him. The morn-
ing came, and found Ina still sitting
there, pale and wan. She was obliged
to start early, and now Sofi came and
called her. Ina did not tell Sofi that
she had taken no rest all night, but,
when she   heard   her step, began
to hurry about, as if dressing in
haste ; and the last things were put
away, her trunks were carried down
stairs, she threw her arms around
Sardo, then one long last kiss to her
baby, as if she were giving it her
soul, and then she turned away, and
followed Sofi. They soon reached
the station ;.it still wanted ten min-
utes to the time of departure.  Soft
could not let her lady leave so alone,
she thought anything was better than
that; she looked hastily around. I
was nearly time for the train to start,
when she saw a gentleman standing

at the door of the saloon; he had
white hair, but was still a handsome
man, - well preserved, the world said
of him, - with a strange mixture of
good-nature and selfishness, worldly
hardness and easy 'benevolence, in
his face. Sofi had no sooner received
the quick impression that he was a
gentleman, and not very young, than
she -ran up to him, leaving Ina in a
state of utter surprise. "'Who can
this new acquaintance be ? " she said
to herself.
" Pardon me, sir," said Sofi in Eng-
lish, " but are you going to Italy'?"
The gentleman looked down at her
with an amused sort of smile, and
answered with indolent indifference,
"I am not going; can I be of any
service to you ?"
Sofi looked up at him with real
distress in her eyes, and said: " 0
no, sir, only my mistress was going,
and she is all alone, and I felt anx-
ious. about her; she is not used to
travelling."
"W/ich is your mistress?" said
the ge tleman. .
Sofi\ turned and pointed towards
Ina; the gentleman raised his eye-
glass a d looked at her for a moment
with th scrutinizing glance of a man
of the .world. Ina blushed scarlet
under his gaze, au' turned away her
head.
"Is your mistress married ?" said
the gentleman.
" No," said Sofi, feeling at that mo-
ment as- if she would have liked to
kill Signor Bertani..
" What is hier name ?" he said.
"' -Mademoiselle Str5hling."
" Ah, a German ; pretty delicate-
looking creature ! Wait a moment I

have some friends who are leaving, -
excellent people, - I will place her
under their charge."
"0, thank you," said Sofi,1 with
fervor.'
"Be sure to be near me just as the
train is going off, and, I will see to
it," he answered kindly.
Sofi hastened back to Ina, to tell
her what she had been doing. 'Ina
felt the awkwardness of her position,
yet she was relieved at the thought
of not being all alone.
"Sofi," she said, , with the tears
welling to her eyes, "you are always
good. I love you dearly, I would'
trust you through -everything; take
care of him," she said, choking, and
now breaking down entirely in her
grief, - "'take care of him; I put
my all in your hands."
"Don't cry so," said Sofi; "if you
do not want to kill me, do not cry
so. You will spoil your beauty fret-
ting, and then he will not care to
look at you."
Ina looked at her "with. a plain-
tive, quivering lip, like a child that
does not know whether to smile or
weep.
" There  come his friends," said
'Sofi; "now  you. stand close by me.
Come'! there is the whistle ; do. not
10   your  ticket, be brave, and
write me the moment you have ar-
rived. I shall be awfully anxious
about you. Come quick, or I shall
lose sight of them."
So saying, sustaining and hurry-
ing her mistress, Sofi hastened for-
ward. "Premieire classe !" shouted
the official at thie door of the car.
"Seconde A fumer !" screamed anoth-
er. .Sofi kept close tp her new ac-

quaintance. The lady and gentlenman
whom he was with had two little
girls; he helped them into the cars,'
and then, turning, said suddenly with
perfect ease, " Ah, pardon me, I for-
got to say that I have a young friend
to put. under your care ; she will go
as far as Italy, with you. Permit
me, Miss Strdhling; Mr. and Mrs'
Colman, - especial friends of mine,"
There was not a second to be lost,
Ina bowed, Sofi looked gratefully at
the gentleman. Ina put her arms
around   Sofi's  neck, and   sobbed,
"Good by, dear ; remember all I told
you; good by."
"Good by," said Sofi, trying to
keep up her courage for Ina's sake'
The whistle sounded, the cars started,
and poor Sofi stood anxiously strain.
ing her eyes after them as they
whirled away, whilst Ina sat leaning
back in the cars, her face covered
with her handkerchief; then she
cried" silently to herself, until with
the monotonous noise and motion of
the train, and with utter weariness,
she fell asleep. When she awak-
ened she looked around, and began to
study unconsciously the faces of her
companions. Of course they were
husband and wife, travelling with
their two children and maid. The
lady was deeply pock-marked, with
rather a hard face, that said, nothing;
two large, rolling eyes, which she
evidently thought very effective, but
which were fixed 'in their expression'
and entirely lifeless ; a small wisp
of canary-colored hair on her head,
resembling very much the sparse
down of those newly fledged birds,
- for she had taken off her hat, un-
fortunately for her fellow-travellers.

She was very thin indeed, and had
excessively emaciated hands,. which
hung helplessly from her wrists. The
gentleman by her side was a large,
fine-looking man, with a very benev-
olent expression.  The  two   little
girls on the opposite side looked like
nothing more than two bowls of
very thin milk, each with two large
lustreless whortleberries floating in
them, -" My eyes !' as their moth-
er said, fondly gazing at them with
her own dark orbs.
"Did you sleep, Miss Strdhling ?"
said the lady, indolently raising her-
self.
'Yes," said Ina.
"Axe you all alone ?"
Ina thought to herself that this
was an unnecessary question, but she
answered again, "Yes."
"You speak English very well,"
said the lady feebly, in a patronizing
tone.
"Thank you," said Ina, trying to
be grateful.
"Have you ever been in Italy be-
fore ?" said the lady.
"Yes," said Ina, blushing.
"You are a German, I believe,
because your hair is light and so
thick," said Mrs. Colman, thinking
contentedly of her own wig, that lay
reposing gently at that moment in
her trunk.
" My dear," said her husband,
and he whispered something in her
ear.
"Now, darling," said Mrs. Colman,
turning gushingly to him, and for
the first time throwing off her sweet
air of indlence,- "now, my darling,
I ought to know best. This is my
husband," she said, turning to Ina.

"My husband thinks I am impor-
tuning you with questions, -don't
you, darling ?" looking at him with
an attempt at coquetry; "but I say
to ry .dear husband, I know best.
My husband, will you lift up Sally's
head ? do, dear ! Will you, my hus-
band, put a pillow under our girl's
head ? Those are my girls, Miss
Strohling, our own, our only ones!
My husband indulges me in every-
thing, -- don't you, my husband, my
precious one, my love? My hus-
band is not demonstrativ , Miss
Strdhling," - she always pronounced
the " Stro5" with great emphasis; as if
the rolling of the letter "r " was a
sign of her perfect knowledge of the
foreign tongue..
Ina looked at her with surprise.
She did not understand why she kept
claiming Mr. Colman with such
" damned  iterance " as hers, as
there could be no possible doubt in
her own mind as to the legitimacy
of her children ; but her conjectures
were cut short by Mrs. Colman's
suddenly turning to her and saying,
in undertones: " Do you not think
it beautiful to love one's husband so
much? I love my husband passion-
ately, but I may say that my love is
of the purest kind, exquisitely pure !
Do you like art, Miss Strohling ?
That is a great purifier to the soul.
My husband bought me the rarest of
the old masters' works last winter
when we were in Italy ; my health
is so fragile that I am obliged to
breathe in warmer climes than our
osvn during the cold season."
Fortunately she did not seem to
care very much for Miss Str~hling's
answers, as she seldom- waiteil for


*                       /

them. "My husband," she said,'turn-
jng tto him languidly, would you,
my eloved, cover my knees with my
cloa ?  My husband has to be very
careful of his own wife, Miss Strbh-
ling, or I fear he would lose her."
Ina looked with increased pity at
Mr. 'Colman, who seemed perfectly
at his ease, his, placidity not at all
disturbed by his wife's unusual deli-
cacy'of constitution  Ina wondered
how such a really pleasing-looking
man could have married such a wo-
man ; how he -could be so kind to
her. What was it that bound them
toget~ier ? Was it wealth ? or had-
he faced the sad horrors of his des-
tiny,, and determined 'to bear it like
a true Christian ? She knew not. His
face was beaming with kindness and
intelligence.. Ina felt so sorry for
him. It was fortunate for her that
she had fallen in with Mr. and Mrs..
Colman, for it took her thoughts,
despite herself, somewhat off her
own troubles. " I am very recherchy
in my tastes," began Mrs. Colman
again, " very reservey, as the French
say ; my husband and I do not care
to make acquaintances ; indeed, we
think it quite vulgar touspeak  ith
our countrymen on the Contin nt ;
it is generally an ordinary class that
travel ! as a gentleman said the
other day, it is principally the canal
of America that go abroad. We keep
ourselves to ourselves ; it was a well-
known fact in Paris, where the first
salons were open to us, that we would
not visit."
.Ina wondered if the Emperor had
interested himself in this fact.
" No, I said, I-travel to enrich my
mind; to hang pictures in it for our

only ones', our girls', future ; and ie
purchase, as we go, all the antics 'We
find for sale. Were you ever in
Spain, Miss Strohling ? "
-" Never," said Ina.
" It is very picturesque ; our jour-
ney there was one romance. I tell-
my husband that our life is a long
honeymoon, - don't I, darling ?"
But darling was looking out of the
window, and did not answer.
"There were a great many price-
less pictures in Spain by tubens;
my husband bought all he found for
our home, to refine it. America needs
refinement, Miss Str6hling. We have
few acquaintances there, because my
husband has very particular notions.
We keep apart ; our little circle is
complete : myself, whom my hus-
band educated ; the sisters of my
husband, also educated by him; and
Nelly Worth, who is all principle
from the crown of her head to the
sole of her feet, - that is our chosen
society."
Ina was beginning heartily to wish
that Sofi had left her to travel all
'alone, but fortunately they had just
arrived at the place wherethey were
to take the diligence over the Spli.
gen. Mr. Colman was very kind in
attending to Ina's baggage; and as
she thought how hard it would have"'
been for her to go 'amongst those
rough drivers, she .felt grateful that
she had any one to,look after her
interests. They travelled the whole
night over the mountain,- Mr. and
Mrs. Colman in happy tte-..A -tete in
a private carriage; -mIa, with the
children and the nurse, in the dili-
gence that carried the mail just be.
fore' them, so that Mrs. Colman's

delicate nostrils had to  nt the
dust of the Alps all the war. The
children had their legs tossing over
poor Ina all the night, but she
id not mind   hem ; her thoughts
were far away, now with the ' be-
loved little roseate form that was
sleeping with an angel smile of inno-
cence on its face, now with him
to whom her heart was impetuously
hurrying ; those dark eyes were rest-
ing on her, not seen for so long a
time ; she was leaning on his strong
arm, laughingly telling him of all her
baby's, grace, happy again with the
happiness of olden times ; all the
troubles of the past were forgotten,
all the tears that had been shed were
ried; she should see him, hear his
low voice, - was not. that enough ?
So the dawn rose and flushed the
mountains with loveliness ; the keen
air blevN on Ina's cheek, and refreshed
her after a long and sleepless night.
She let down her long hair for a mo-
ment; it caught one of the little girl's
great eyes as she lay gazing at Ina,
and she put out her hand and said:
"How pretty 1 it dazzles just like the
sun! how nice! we can pull it, and
it does n't cbe off like mamma's."
Ina could not help smiling.
They stopped at a little village to
rest for a few hurs before taking
the boat down Lake Como. .Ina
threw herself on the bed, and' was
soon fast asleep ; she was waked by
Mrs. Colman's voice saying at her
. door, "Miss Strbhling, I am sorry
to disturb you, but I think it is time
you should be up."
" Thank you," said Ina in her
broken English, " you are very
kind;" 'and she sprang up and pre-

pared herself quickly for her further
journey.
Mrs. Colman was awaiting her
with a smile full of languor. "Did
you rest well ?" she said. " I do not
think I should live long if I travelled
so rapidly for a great way ; we. do
not - my husband and myself - ap-
prove of the American mode of trav-
elling ; this constant motion is quite
vulgar, repose is true elegance !"
- They went on to the boat together.
" Have you observed," said Mrs.
Colman, "that my chest is too round'?
I am not naturally deformed, I would
not have you think so, but," she said,
lowering her voice, " I wear a large
box on my breast constantly, when
travelling ; they are my peerless
jewels, pearls from the Orient and
diamonds which a Spanish prince
collected for his bride, and just as the
marriage was about to be consum-
mated he died; it was sad for them,
but a great bargain for Mr.. Colman."
Ina was obliged to take a seat by
Mrs. Colman; after her children had
been caressed sufficiently, she turned
to Ina and said, " 0 my darlings, my
cherished ones, how proud I am of
them! Had you really, Miss Stroh-
ling, observed my chest ?"  Ina did
now, and thought with a smile what
would her form be when she reNoved
the only thing which apparently
gave it any consistency of shape at
all.
"You cannot imagine," continued
Mrs. Colman, " how I look when I
am dressed ! My husband is very fond
of me when I am in full toilet. 'Since
our own, the birthi of our first, he
has not been willing that I should
wear low neck, so I wear Pompy-

door; my diamonds lie around my
throat, and I wear acoronet in my
hair ; it is elegant, with my pearls
from  the Orient in myears,-you
cannot judge of me as you see me
here!"
Ina smiled again as she thought
o the hair that came off, but Mrs.
Colman had a frank, opennature, and
she. quickly added: "I brought a
French maid with me from Paris to
dress my wig last winter.   I am
obliged ,to wear one. I shall take
her for that express purpose to Amer-
ica; she does it exquisitely ! My
husband has prepared me a home
there Miss Strbhling, and a very
lovely one it is, with art in the cham-
bers, blood horses in our stable, glass'
coaches from  Paris! I am  sure I
ought to love hin; he has the purest
nature I think I ever knew !"
Ina looked up, and said: " Mrs.
Colman, I think you ought to be
perfectly happy, with a husband so
devoted, two near little children, -a
beautiful home, horses, diamonds,,
everything !"
"My dear," said Mrs. Colman,
with a pleased smile of self-compla-
cence, "I-deserve it all."
This cut short all further argu-
ment, and now Mr. Colman came up,
and pointed out to Ina all the most
remarkable places on the lake.
Ina saw that Mrs. Colman was
looking at her very eagerly, her great
empty eagle eyes growing full of an-
gry light; she moved away, and sat
down. Mr. Colmian followed her,
and offered to hold her parasol. -
"No, thank you:' said Ina; "I can
shade myself."
"My dear," said Mrs. Colman,

"Miss Strohling is perfectly able to
see. for herself, and to take care of
herself also, I should think.",
Ina was annoyed ; she took up a
book, and read until. it was time o
take the cars again. Just as she was
getting in, Mr. Colman kindly pla.
cing her bag inside of the door, Mrs.
Colman, suddenly     forgetting  her
graceful languor, pulled him away
with a' jerk and said, " Come into
this car." Ina was only too glad to
be left alone, and so on they went,
speeding towards- their destiny, on
and on. She would have been glad
if the cars had never stopped.. Once
Mr. Colman came to ask if he could
get her anything to eat. Ina had
just thought what-a comfort it would
be to have something, when she
heard Mrs. Colman's shrillvoice from
the other car calling out, " My hus-
band, you will be late ! my husband,,
come!"
He stopped and said, "Do let me
help you to something."
" No, thank you," said Ina, "noth-
ing."
The cars had forty minutes to
wait, so Mr. Colman had time suffi-
cient to return to his wife, and Ina
jumped out herself and bought some
grapes and cakes that were standing
on the table of the restaurant. On
and on, hour after hour, they travelled,
until at last they were approaching,
Turin. 0, how her heart beat ! what'
were time and distance now ? She-
should see him soon, and the cars
slackened their pace, and stopped.
She seized her bag and cloak, turned
to bow to Mr. and Mrs. Colman,
strained her eyes through the morn-
ing mist to see if the one being on

earth for her was there, uttered a
low scream of joy, and sprang for-
ward into Emanuele Bertani's arms.
He held her to him for a momex,
glanced hastily around to see if any
one were looking at them, and then,
withdrawing his arms from her, led
her away to the carriage that was
awaiting them.
"Have you your ticket," he said,
"for your trunks ? "
"0 yes, but I do not care for
them; only come, and let me be once
more a moment with you."
"In a second, and I am all yours,
Ina."
He ran to find her trunks,'and re-
turned with a man carrying them ;
they were thrown up on to the car-
riage, the door was closed, and she
was once more alone with Emanuele.
CHAPTER VIII.
IN an elegantly furnished parlor
in Turin, in one of those houses
which front on the beautiful piazza
where is the . statue- of Emanuele
Filiberto, a little group of people
were sitting at about twelve o'clock
in the morning : one of these was
an elderly gentleman with a face
from which the rarest benevolence
shone; kindness and good-humor
sparkled in his eyes, and he had a
smile when he spoke, that, as Ina
said, almost lit the room. She had
never seen any one else smile so
entirely until she had seen her wh~n
sh~e always called her Princess. On
the sofa half reclined, -in an indolent
attitude, this gentleman's wife. Just

by her side sat in demure propriety
two pale young girls ; they looked
as if they needed country air,' and
something of the freedom of the
country too. ' A young gentleman
with an easy, elegant air was stand-
ing by the mantel watching a very
handsome yoig woman who was
talking with his mother. The young
widow -for such she was -- was.
handsomely dressed in a black velvet
walking-costume, trimmed with rich
sable furs, and a black velvet bonnet;
the tiniest little muff was hanging
suspended by a rich gold chain to
one of the button-holes of her waist;
her * hand. was playing with a gold
card-case which sparkled with jewels;
her glove was lying onher lap, and
the hand which was ungloved was
dazzlingly white, and all the more
so from the contrast it made as it
lay on her dark dress.
"I do not know," she said, appar-
ently in answer to a question. that
had been put her by the gentleman
who was standing. " I always think
of those lines that I as the Countess
repeated that evening we gave 'The
Follies' of a ibight,' at Madame
Arnaud's, -
'Pleasure calls, and from her corps
absent ont toujours tort,' 
do you remember it? " she said, look-
ing up at him with an arch smile.
"I remember that -you were ra-
diant then, as ever."
"And I remember that you did
not once applaud me; that you stood
sternly looking in royal displeasure
at me, as if I were something that
you even honored with your pres-
ence;' she said, laughing. " By the
way, did-you not tell me that Madem-

oiselle Ina was about to return to
yot ?" -
'We are expecting her to-day,"
said Madame Benoni, with an indo-
lent manner, as oif it were rather an
exertion to her to speak at all; "and
I do hope, when she comes, that we
shall have some quiet in the house, -
not that my children mean to be
noisy, Madame de Turenne, not that
they would, I suppose, willingly hurt
their mother's feelings, but my nerves
are in such a delicate state that I
can bear less than other people. I
do not mean to complain, but I must
say," laying great stress on all her
verbs, "that I should have thought
their father would assist me during
the very long and painful absence
of Mademoiselle Strohling."
"Uarissima mia," said that kind-
hearted gentleman, " I thought I
had done everything I could to re-.
lieve you of your cares. I have not
been to my clubonce since she left,
that I might stay and read to my
girls ; and this,".he said gayly, "is
the'reward of all my martyrdom."
"Well, my dear, I am sorry you
think it martyrdom. I afn very
sorry that we have all deprived you
of so much pleasure! I reo-ret it
always deeply when I am    in any
one's way, but I should have thought
it would be a consolation to you to
teach your own children."
"And your own too, my dear, I
believe," he said, laughing.
"I shouldhave supposed, Signor
B3enoni, that this remark might have
been spared me ; there is a want of
good taste in it, not to say delicacy"
. only before our girls I am mortified
that you force me to use the word."

ier husband laughed again.
"My dear, if you would spare me
that laugh! it does fall on my nerves!
Not tlat I suppose you intentionally
would be so thoughtless as to laugh
so loud, but I must confess that it'
distresses me. I have spoken of it
so often, and I should have thought
you would have sought, during the
many years of our married life, to
correct a habit which you knew was
personally disagreeable to me; but
I see," she said, with a deep sigh,
"that it is useless to cherish any
hopes."
'Is Monsieur Bertani still inti-
mate at your house ?" said Madame
de Turenne. She knew that he was,
and had come there to call that
morning with a faint hope of meet.
' ing him.
" He visits us," said Madame Be-
noni, with a self-complacent smile,
"more intimately, perhaps, than any
other person in Turin."
" 0 my dear child," said Monsieur
Benoni, "-Bertani is everywhere ; he
is the best man I know; he is, in-
deed, the only minister we have had
for years that has filled his place!
He is' not a renegade to his own
principles, like Ricasoli, nor a pan-
derer  to  the  King, like Ratazzi
What he means, he says ; perhaps
he is a, little ambitious, but that is a
virtue rather than a defect."
"Well, my dear, I am very glad
you so fully appreciate our friend
Bertani,-yes, I may say very glad,
- but why you'say he is everywhere
Ido not know ; why you are not
willing to accept the compliment he
pays to this house I must confess I
do not quite understand. I say

openly that I am proud of Signor
Bertani's very marked preference of
our house to any other, - yes, I
may say to any other."
Monsieur Marcello looked at his
mother very quietly, and then at
Madame de Turenne, to see if she was'
laughing at her, -he could not have
forgiven that -but she was listen-
ing with the greatest apparent defer-
ence to all that fell from the lips of
Madame Benoni.
"Mademoiselle Ina," said Madame
de Turenne, "is a lovely creature to
look at; I used to' think that Mon-
sieur Bertani or Monsieur Marcello
would have been lost in her charms,
being in such constant intercourse
with her !"
"Neither Monsieur Bertani nor
my son Marcello will, I trust, ever
demean themselves by a misalli-
ance," said Madame Benoni, forget-
ting for a moment her over-suscepti-
ble nerves, and rising' partly from
her Oriental attitude.
"I do not know what you mean by
that expression," said her son. "I
do not wish to make the conversation'
personal, but I utterly detest that
word. I see no misalliance at all
between a beautiful, highly educated
young woman, and a minister who
has raised himself to his position
merely through his own talents, or,"
he said, laughing, " a young man who
owes, perhaps, all the position he has
in the beau monde to the good fortune
of having a rich father. This coun-
try ia detestable with its aristocrat-
ic prejudices, which permeate all
classes." .
"Well, iniy dear Marcello, I think
it would have been, perhaps, more

respectful to have spoken less open-
ly of your mother's faults. I had
thought that you would have shel-
tered her from any attack, that you
would have defended her from the
shafts of calumny ; but I see that it
is not well to expect too much from
one's son, or one must be deeply
disappointed."
Marcello was silent before this re-
buke ; it was very seldom that he
answered any of his mother's argu-
ments ; unless -what she said had
particularly nettled him, he chafed
in silence at her remarks.
"I did not see you last night,
Monsieur Marcello, at the opera. I
wonder you' did not go. I have
scarcely ever known a man so little
a, votary of pleasure as you are.
I, au 'contraire, like t live pour
m'amuser.    All the   world  was
there last evening; they gave 'Le
Prophate.' It was   really. g  d ;
there is a moment when in that
royal march the music rises to such
intensity that it is almost impossible
to sit still, one scarcely breathes
with excitement. I do not believe
in the world there is a people that
feels music as we do; it seems to
penetrate every fibre, ito creep into
every crevice of the Italian. There
is something beautiful in feeling that
mere sound can give such an ex-
quisite sense of enjoyment. Madame
de Stael used to say that Paris is the
place where one can best do without
happiness; but I think it' is Italy,
because we have music in ourselves."
"I was there last evening," he
said, "and enjoyed the opera, and I
also enjoyed turning my lorgnom
towards a certain box where beauty

and talent were seated, absorbed in
one another."
"Were they in one person," she
said, indifferently, " or in two ?"
"The two were in one," he said,
bowing to her, "and I sometimes
fear the one was in two."
"You are very enigmatical, Mon-
sieur Marcello, and I confess I am
not clever enough to understand you."
"It is the first time that you have
done me the honor to mistake me
for a sphinx."
Madame de Turenne took out her
watch; opened it indolently ; there
was a little crown in emeralds set in
white enamel on the back. "I hate
these little stones," she said; "they
make me think always of green-eyed
jealousy."
"You were never jealous, I sup-
pose ? " said Monsieur Marcello.
"I trust not," the said, her eyes
slightly flashing, "nor that I ever
shall be ; I should be terrible."
" Yes," he said,'laughing. " I can
imagine you as a magnificent Phedre,
or a Medea, or as Norma. Poor
Adelgisa ! she would stand very
little chance !"
" You are impitoyable," she said,
"incorrigible ; if i, were not for our
old acquaintance, and that you had
openly forsworn my colors, I would
not forgive you."
"'Au contraire," he said, "I en-
tered the lists for them, but found
them on another's breast, - and hid-
den, too, where they never would
have been discerned save for a fall
and a bad wound."
Madame de Turenne bh~ished scar-
let "I mux~st gol' she said; "IL see ;
you are implacable to-day !" She i

rose to leave, the room, when sud-
denly the door opened, and an excla.
mation of joy from the two girls,
who hitherto had sat like carved
statues, made Madame de Turenne
look up ; there stood Ina before her
and, just behind, Signor.Bertani.
"0 1xry dear Mademoiselle," said
Madame Benoni, " I ani really grate.
ful to see you here ;. this will be a
comfort to their father and to me.
We thought you had entirely forgot.
ten us."
" Ah,  Mademoiselle    Strohling,"
said Monsieur Benoni, " you are
very welcome indeed ; home did not
half seem home withoutyou !"
"I must say," said Madame Be-
noni, " that to me that seems a most
superfluous remark; however, chacun
a son godt, as the French say." The
two young girls rose timidly, and a
smile lit their sallow faces as they
went towards Ina; she stooped and
kissed them warmly.
"Mademoiselle Strohling, we were
just speaking of you," said Madame
de Turenne, " and," she said archly,
"a gentleman said that you were
very lovely, which no lady here
present dared to deny."
" Mademoiselle Strohling has not
noticed one who would be glad to
claim her as an old friend," said
Monsieur Marcello, for the first time
coming forward.
"Take off your bonnet, my dear,"
said Madame Benoni; " we feel grate-
ful to Monsieur Bertani for so kindly
offering to go for you; his real friend-
ship for the family makes him always
thoughtful of . all their interests. I
must say that I wish I could say ha
much for many others."

," Thank you," said Ina; "how  i
natural it looks here ! I am glad to t
be back in my old place."          t
" You look very pale, my dear," t
said Madame Benoni; "you are shock- U

How is your brother ? " said I
Monsieur Benoni, looking up kindly
from his paper, which he was read-r
ing in the window.
Ina blushed. crimson, and stam-
mered out, " He is well, thank you."]
" But he was very ill, I fear," said
Monsieur Benoni, warmly.
"-Yes," said Ina, not raising her#
eyes. When she did do so, she met
Monsieur Marcello's fixed  on 'her
with a scrutinizing gaze ; she colored-
again, and her eyes fell.
"Has Signor Bertani so much time
to spare ?" said Madame de Turenne,
by whose side he now stood.
"He is always at the command of
his friends," he answered.
- " And they are very, very few ?"
.she asked, looking up with her lan-
guid eyes in his face.
"Quality makes up for quantity,"
he said, laughing.
" And who is so happy as to pos-
sess that quality ?" she said.
"She who is so flattering as to put
the question," he answered.
"I must go," said Madame de Tu-
renne. " Mademoiselle Strdhling, I
should be enchantee to see you at
my house, when Madame Benoni
favors me with a visit."
"You are very kind,"  id Ia.
"Let me see you to your coach,"1
said Bertani, who knew that Madame
de~ Tmenne was at Madame Benoni's,
as he had seen her carriage standing

n the street, and this was the reason
hat he had not bade Ina farewell at
he door, as he had previously in-
ended, so as not to seem too partic-
ular in his attentions by coming in
with her, as the morning was always
he time when he was supposed to
be most completely occupied.
"No, thankyou," she said; "I will
go alone." Bertani did not insist, and.
Marcello stood without offering his
services, as he had seen those of
Bertani rejected; she courtesied low,
and left. the room.
" She is very handsome," said Ber-
tani, " very elegant-looking."
"She has been accustomed," said
Marcello, "from childhood, to the
most aristocratic society, so that 'her
manners are certainly elegant, and
she is handsome too; but I do not
fancy her style. She has been too
much used to -conquering ; wherever
she moves she has her suite of ad-
mirers, and the greater the number
of her victims, the better she, esteems
it for her credit,; she is clever and
cultivated, but rather heartless, I fear,
and I own I do not like that kind of
woman, even though she were as
beautiful as a Venus."
"Pique, my dear Marcello, pique
breathes in every word you say; the,
fair creature has not yet said, 'Nul
ne touche a la reine except6 le roi.
Levez-vous,   roi   de  Lion,    mon
4poux!"
"Perhaps it is so," said Marcello,
laughing.
" But I must be off," said Bertani.
." I have to go to the Conuhittee of
the Chamber before, it rises to-day. I
shall step in this evening to 'dee
how you all are, and I hope Mad-

emoiselle Strohling will have rested
from her long journey."
In the mean time Madame' de Tu
renne, the object of so much discus
sion, had gone unaccompanied t
her coach for the simple reason tha
she did not want Signor Bertani t(
see that she already had a gentleman
with her. A handsome young man
'sprang from the carriage, and helped
her in, and then followed her and
took the empty seat by her side.-
"You were an age, Camilla,", he
said'; "I saw that god- of the day,
Bertani, pass in with a charming
young creature, and I suppose the
interesting Pylades was within."
"Yes," said Madame de Turenne,
"he was there."
"Camilla, how cold your lovely
face looks, and you were warm and
radiant as the sun just before you
left me here ; you have as many
moods as the day has hours, but
you. are' always beautiful in my
eyes." He took her hand.,
Camilla drew it impatiently away.
"Why' are you so changed of late
to me? You used to let your hand
lie in mine."
"My heart is an instrument dif-
ferently' tuned at different times,"
she said, with some petulance.
Camilla, do not be so unkind, so
unlike yourself!"
"'If it were unlike myself, then it
would not be me, so it should not
trouble you at all !"
"I adore you," said the young
gentleman at her side.
"And I am tired of adoration ; I
want to be loved, and esteemed, and
not; treated like a goddess ; there is
nothing makes one feel so like fall-

d ing down and crushing the adorer to
atoms, as to be placed on a pedestal
too high for one's own estimation of
- one's self."
o    "But T see no faults' in you Ca-
t milla; to me you are divine: a Juno,
a Pomona, a Cleopatra, a Niobe, a
'saint, all in one."
"You ought to see my faults, I
wish you would ! You know I am
haughty, proud, imperious, impa.
tient, and a hundred other; detesta-
ble things; why do you not hate
me for them ? "
"You did not once speak to me
so; you used to listen to me whilst a
sweet smile parted your lips, - those
lips; Camilla, so warm to the touch."
"If you have ever had a favor
from a woman, you should not boast
of .it, or she will despise you! I
* thought I loved you once. I was
not coquetting with you; I felt lone.
ly, and you came ! I warned you
from loving me. I told you I never
knew my own mind, that I was
fickle, that if you wantedto bask in
the sun whilst it was warm, well,
but that it might be withdrawn from
you at any time ! I never said
I would marry you; I. never told
you it was forever, and now it is
past. I would have told you before,
but I was not sure of it myself;
now forewarned is forearmed. I
am your friend if you wish it, but.do
not talk to me of love."
The young man's eyes filled with
tears.
*"Is it indeed true ?." he said, de-
spair in his tones.
- "Do not be angry with me, Miro,"
she said, putting her beautiful hand4
over his. "I never really meant to

deceive you; I want to be frank and
true. I am in my words, but some-
how I cannot be in my actions, and
then you suffer for it."  '
"You have made me miserable fbr
life," he said with anguish. "I wish
I could hate you,.but everything you
do seems to fascinate me,more and
more, and even when you show all
your heartlessness most, even then
one must forgive you!"
"Ah," said Camilla, leaning her
head against her hand, and looking
at him earnestly, " do not curse me !
Suppose I were to find that I had a
heart, that all I had made others
suffer so cruelly, and never realized
at all, noiv should come back to me !
that for every pang given I felt one
myself; suppose'I too could not rest,
and that there should come a time
when I could not eat or sleep at all!
God forbid !" she said. "II seem to
feel it as it all might be ;-would it
not be dreadful? I never thought
of that; would that not be revenge
for all, all that I have caused to
suffer? would that not suffice you,
Miro ? 0, do not wish such terrible
suffering to me, I could not bear it !"
"Why then did you make others
suffer so much,? why did you never
stop to think of all your eyes said,
with their deep glances, and of all
the, heaven on your lips ?"-
"As I told you," she said, almost
sullenly, " I nev r thought of it at all.
I only wanted to feel less lonely my-
-self for the time being; I drank a
little of the intoxicating draught of
pleasure, because I could not find
happiness, -.and now, Miro, I do not
want you to torment me any more ;
it is torture to me every time you

touch me ; all that is past, you must
just be my friend or nothing ! will
you consent ?"
"I will not accept, Madame, so
ignominious a position ; you have
played with me long enough, you
have led me on and onby the load-
stone of your eyes until I was blind-
ed; you will regret it, perhaps, sooner
or later."
"Miro," she said,- with a smile all
grace and captivation, " will you not.
forgive and forget ? will you not love
me a little still ?"
"0 Camilla, if you speak and look
thus, you know I am your slave
again at your feet. Do you love me ?"
he said passionately.
"No," she answered coldly. " I see
how it will be; I shall have to an-
swer for this too. ,I shall miss you,
Miro, but it is better that we should
part now."
The carriage stopped at a jeweller's
shop, where she had ordered the
coachman to drive. "Will you come
in with me?" she said winningly ;
"just a few moments more!"
" No," he said, "it is enough." He
touched his hat and turned the cor-
ner. Camilla's first impulse was to
run after him, her second to go in
and look at a diamond pin of the new-
est mode;. but it did not tempt her
now, and the stones fell cold and
lifeless on her eyes.

Ina to see so little life in their faces ;
they were old before their time ;
their mother pruned away and cut
down all that was superfluous, as
she thought, in their natures. Ina
thought, as she  looked  at them,
"Poor things ! they have not even
had a happy childhood., I had that
when my dear another lived.  I wish
I could be with some one who
looked happy ! The only person who
seemed glad of anything was Madame
de Turenne-; she has everything, life
seems spread out like a rich banquet
before her!"
"Are you glad to see me back
again?" said Ina, feeling as if she
must say something.
"0, very !" they both answered in'
the same breath, and a little color
came into their pale cheeks.
"What did you study while I was
gone, Adelheide ?"-      .
"We studied with mamma, but
she said we made her nervous.
Marcello would ,have taught us, but
he is busy in the daytime, and at
night papa wanted us all to himself;
only mamma said she must be there
too, and so we did not learn as
much, because, if we ask a question,
mamma says it falls on her nerves."
"And whom did you see when I
was away ? "
"0, nobody; if there is any formal
company, then we stay up stairs."
"But you were there to-day when.
Madame de Turenne was there."
"0 yes, but then she is so inti-
mate at our house, and mamma did
not receive any one else- yesterday.
Marcello 'stayed at home' from his
business for the first time; I do not
know why."

"And Signor Bertani," said Ina,
"'does he not come as often as
usual ?"
"0 yes, but we are afraid of him."
"Afraid of your papa's and your
brother's best friend !"
"Yes. Marie says he looks like a
black cloud, but mamma reproved
her, and said she did not wish her
children ever to use figurative ex-
pressions ; what did that mean, Miss
Strdhling ? We did not like to ask
mamma, for she says she never feels
so well if we put any questions to
her."
" It means poetical," said Ina.
"Does it ?" said Maria. "I should
think mamma would be glad to
have me say anything that sounds
like poetry."
Ina smiled.
" That is the first time I have seen
you smile, Miss Struhling, since you
came ; it must have been, as mam-
ma feared, that you yourself were
very ill."
Ina was silent. Dinner was an-
nounced. Marcello was not at the
table. The dinner passed off in
great silence ; Madame Benoni re-
quired  the   excitement  of some
stranger to make her talk at all,
Monsieur Benoni seemed to have
something on his mind, and the chil-
dren were told never to speak at
meals unless spoken to. After din-
ner they weht into the parlor to take
their coffee. Ina was listening, with
that terrible intensity which shuts
out all other sounds, to hear if the
door-bell would ring. She was wait-
ing for Emanuele ; she looked around
hopelessly, as she thought, " How
shall I speak with him ?"

The hall door opened, but it was
with a latch-key; Marcello entered.
with Bertani. Emanuele gave a
quick look at NIna; she felt it, al-
though she did/not raise her eyes.
Marcello came near the table where
she sat, and took a chair by her side.
"I regretted," he said, "not being
able to get home to dine with you
at your first dinner in our house
after so long a time."   Monsieur
Benoni was talking with Emanuele,
and Madame Benoni was as usual re-
clining on her sofa, listening to them.
"Thank you," said Ina, scarcely
heeding what he said. She felt that
Emanuele's eyes were on her, al-
though he was apparently discussing
politics with much interest with
Monsieur Benoni.
"You look ill," said Marcello ; " I
am afraid you have suffered- from
nursing your brother."
Ina did not answer.
"Your brother lives in Zurich,
does he- not ?"
"Yes," said Ina, without looking
at him.
"Then it was at Zurich that you
were with him ?"
" Yes," said Ina, coloring painfully.
"My dear Miss Strdhling, you are
not well," he said, lowering his voice.
"I trust you will not begin your
lessons immediately with my sis-
ters ; do rest. My mother has a
kind heart, although sometimes the
says things which might lead you to
- i   believe otherwise. I entreat you not
to sacrifice your health; I wish I
knew of anything I .could do for
ytou !"
mna thought that the only remedy
was to be with him who sat opposite

4
them, looking'at her under his hand,
with which he had shaded his eyes,
and to hear him  say passionately s
he once did, " I love you, Ina!" but
she said ,only, " Thank you, you are
very good."
"Good or bad," he said, smiling,
"I think any one's heart would be
touched by seeing you look so mis.
erable."
"Miss   Strdhling," said Bertani,
"did   you  have a very fatiguing
journey ? You really look ill."
"That is just what I was saying
to her," said Marcello.
"You are neither of you very flat-
tering," said Ina, faintly smiling; "I
know of no harder way to enter a
lady's good graces than by disprais-
ing her to her face."
"It is a proof," said Emanele,
"that we think her above flattery!"
"She is certainly not like our
friend Madame de Turenne," said
Marcello.
"You are unfair," said Bertani,
"towards that fair lady; if you had
ever had one glance from those
Ethiop eyes, you would not dare to
speak thus."
" Meaning that others have," said
Marcello, laughing, and making a
polite inclination towards Monsieur
Bertani,           -
"You wish to revenge yourself on
Rome like Coriolanus, because Rome
does not see your virtues," said
Bertani.
"I am certainly like him in not
wishing to show my scars."
" The De Turenne scar would be a
deep' one," said Bertani. " I should
not want to be wounded by those
eyes."

"Yes; over her door is written
'Lasciate ogni speranza voi che en-
trate,"* said Marcello.
na rose, and stood by the mantel-
piece, as if she had drawn nearer the
fire to warm herself. Bertani rose,
and said, " With your leave, I will go
into the library. I want to look out
Lady Hamilton's life; there is some-
thing in, the lady we speak of and
in Nelson's seductress that seems to
me to bear a     resemblance.   She
looks like a portrait I once saw of
that great enchantress ! "
" Do," said Madame Benoni to Ina,
"ring the bell for me, my dear, in
the next room; this' one is broken.
I must confess I know of nothing
more trying to the nerves than to
pull a bell that does not make any
sound; it is really distressing, but I
have found that no appeals, either to
my son or to his father, have any
effect upon them."
Ina went into the next room;
there stood Bertani, his back turned
to the door by which she had en-
tered. He was sitting, his cigar in
one hand, and turning over the pages
of a biographies gintrale.  She went
quickly over to him; he started
slightly.
"Why are you here ?",he said.
"For God's sake," she said, in an
under voice of suppressed agony, "if
you have any mercy in your soul,
speak to me, tell me that you love
me !"
"Will they not notice your ab-
sence ?"
"No," she said, quickly; ;"Madame
Benoni sent me to ring the bell; the
door-bell outside rang twice, and
* "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

the servant did not attend to it;
some. one will be coming in, they
will not miss us. Do you not see
that you are killing me ? Ah, I shall
die if you do not destroy this wall
between us)  Tell me you love me."
"I love you passionately," he
said.
"It is false !" said Ina; "it is I
who love you so," and her eyes
flashed like her brother's. If he had
seen her now, he would have thought
that she knew how to vindicate her
own rights !
Emanuele looked at her with ad-
miration. She saw the light of old
in his eyes, and she took 'new hope
from it.
"You are fretting for the child,"
he said; "your heart is divided
now.
"It is false," she said again, "and
you know it ! I love him, yes, better
than life; but I have loved you bet-
ter than my own honor, - better,
then, than him."
Some company had entered the
parlor; they heard voices talking,
they felt that they were' safe from
interruption.
He drew her to him, and kissed her
passionately; then she lay again, as
of old, tightly enclosed in his strong
arms.
" Listen," she said ; " for God's
sake, do not be angry with me, but
- I have seen my brother!"
"Where ?". he said, loosening his
hold on her, his face flushing.
"At my cottageI!" she said, "and
he thought I was dishonored. Ah,
Emanuele, I have let my beloved
little Sofi think ill of me, but my
brother ! my mother in dying left

me to him, -it was stronger than
my promise; I epd not break his
heart. If it had been to right my-
self, I would not have spoken, but it
was too terrible to see him standing
there, so bowed with grief !"
"And he knows all?" he said,.al-
most glaring at poor Ina.
"No, no, not your name, - by all
that is sacred to' you, Emanuele, do
not look at me so ! Ah, he does not
dream who you are, I fear not for
that; but he said that if the man I
loved did not give me his name' be-
fore all the world, he would kill him.
0, I wish," she said, with infinite
dreariness in her voice, "that he
would kill me!",
Emanuele laughed a hollow laugh,
and said: "I fear not for my life, I
fear not a ooward who strikes in the
dark; but how could 'you, Ina, so
break your word ?"
"It was better than to keep . it
thus," she said, in sullen despair.
"And do you mean henceforward
to keep ,your word, or do you mean
to break it ? for I must know be-
forehand."
"0," she said, wringing her hands,
"you know I mean' to keep my word ;
but tell me," she said, growing sud-
denly calm, and folding her arms,
"do you never mean to give me
openly your name?"
"I will speak to you of that an-
other time," he said; "now you are
too much excited, you are not your-
self."
"Bertani,' said Marcello, entering
hastily, "have you found Lady
Hamilton's likeness ? for here is
Gualterio, who, strange to say, finds
the same resemblance that you do."

"Yes, here. it is ; I will show it
him, .it is very like. Mademoiselle
Strdhling and I have been looking
over these portraits together."' And
Bertani left the room.
"Will you," said Ina, looking up
at Marcello, - "will you. tell your
mother that I could not sit up? I
will not go back into the parlor; I
really have such, a dreadful pain in
my head." She moved a step, and
staggered.
."Lean  on me," he said, gently.
"Poor thing !" looking    down' ten.
derly at her. "I swear that if I
thought my best friend ,had done
you an injury, I would kill him in
cold blood. Do not shrink from me;
I know that you do not love me, --
it matters not,-but I have loved
you from the first. Ah, Miss Str1hbl-
ing, a lover's eyes are more pene-
trating than those of the rest of the
world.   I, would have spoken long
since, but I saw it would come too
late;' but believe me, if you need
help, a loyal friend, a brother, with
more than a brother's care for you,
fear not, to come to me ; my life
shall be at your disposal. I cannot
say more."
"No one can help me," said Ia.
" You do not know," he said, lead-
ing her to the door. "Good night,
God bless and protect you."
Ina loolped up into his face with
gratitude; she could not speak, but
she felt less lonely for his kindness.
She listened to the voices down
stairs until she heard the door open
She went to the window. Bertani
passed out of the dark porch below;
she could have spoken to him with-
out danger, but she did not wish to.

g1e walked quickly down the street,'
and disappeared from Ida's straining
sight.
CHAPTER X.
NA received every day a letter
dictated by Sofi and written by
Gabriele ; there it was always at her
plate when she went down to break-
fast. It was her only ray of sun-
shine all the day.  Sofi told her that
the baby was well, that he had be-
gun to look at his hands, that he
had fixed his eyes on Ina's photo-
graph when Sofi had handed it to
him, -she was not sure whether he
knew it was his mother or not, -
that she longed for her mistress
more than for anything in life ; and
she asked her when .they should
come and be together once more.
"Have you friends    in Lucerne,
and such warm   ones?" said Mar-
'cello one day to her, as she put her
letter in her pocket at the breakfast-
table. She always liked to read it
when alone, all alone in her room.
"Yes," said Ina, coloring deeply,
then growing  pale, and    coloring
again.
"I would not - have asked you
such a question, had I thought to
distress you, believe me. I do not
know how it is possible for me to
give so much pain, when I may
truly say I would rather suffer most
acutely niyself than inflict suffering
on you."
"I do not know," said Ina, thought-
fully, "why you would be so gen-
erotis to me ; mental pain is so ter-
rible to bear !"

"From the most selfish of princi-
ples," he answered, quietly; "I
thought that I had told you the
other evening that I love you."
" Then it is true?" said Ina, look-
ing up in his face deprecatingly, as
if she longed to have hm deny it.
" It is true, Miss Strohling ; I re-
gret myself that it is so."
" Then I must go," said Ina, with
deep anguish- in her tones ; then
with sudden energy, she said, "You
must not love me, Monsieur Mar-
cello ! you must not think of me at
all! It is dreadful," she said, turning
very pale, "even to speak of such
a thing; you do not know what it
would be to love me; you would
never be, happy. again in your life
if you did !"
"I cannot see anything so dreadful
in it, Miss Strohing," he said, smil-
ing.  "Every  one must take the
consequences of his own actions. I
accept mine. I have my pride, Miss
Str6hling,* like another man. You
know I passed most of my youth in
England. My mother is half Eng-
lish herself, and therefore, when I
spoke, I did not mean love in the
Italian sense, made ip of declara-
tions of death and despair. I did
not intend that you should imagine
I would kill myself for you; it
would be better, I think, to live and
watch over your interests. I told
you once that. I knew I had come
too late, and I abide by that decision
which destiny has thought to be for
my good; for I believe that nothing
is that is not best for us in the end,
however unhappy that fate may be.
I cannot bear to hear a man speak-
ing of his disappointments and sor-

rows; he must battle with them
not succumb to them. Have pa-
tience with me yet for one moment
When I said I loved you, I meant
merely that which is unalterable in
my heart ; it is a feeling without
desire, without hope, of entire de-
votion to the object loved. I shall
never, believe me, offend you again
by the use of the word, but allow
me to say that I shall feel the same;
yes, even though I should know you
to be another's man's wife, even
though years , should elapse, and
though I might never again see you.
Call it friendship if you choose, but
it is stronger than common friend-
ship, and that is scarcely, I think,
the name for it."
"Would it not be wrong, then, for
me to remainhere? " said Ina.  "It
would be a consolation to me, to
think so ; you speak so differently
from any other maifnthat-"
" Because,", he said, " most men do
not stop to weigh what they say;
they~ forget everything in the one
desire of possession at the moment ;
they must have, at all hazards of life
or death, what they wish, and then
what is obtained in ,such hot haste
is repented of as surely, and almost
as quickly."
Ina heaved a heavy sigh.
"Promise me," he said, "that my
presence here shall never influence
you, in any way, in a decision to
leave this house; it is little for you
to grant to me who would have
asked so much."
" I promise you," said Ina, " and I
feel deeply grateful to. you, only I
know not how to express it in words."
" I do not wish gratitude," he an-

, swered, "only that you will have
- confidence in me, and remember
that my services are ever at your
t command."
" Miss Str5hling, Miss Strohling,
t do call papa ! Mamma says she has
such an access."
- Ina went quickly, and told Mon-
sieur Benoni, who was in the library,
that his wife was not well. The
good gentleman smiled     under his
spectacles, and said: " I will go lpres.
ently, Miss Strohling ; I doubt if her
disease cannot wait a moment."
Monsieur Benoni found his wife
in her usual attitude of graceful re-
pose, but her face had in it nothing
of the rest of her body. He knew
that a storm was brewing, and he
prepared himself to meet it.
" And how is my darling," he said,
" this morning ?"
" Monsieur Benoni, it is not now
the time for soft words. I firmly
believe you would all leave me here
to die; every one save my family
feels for my broken constitution, for
my poor frail body ; but from those
around me I have ever met .with the
most heartless indifference."
"Why, my dear treasure, you are
not  certainly  well  to-day ; your
nerves are really affected, my love."
"They are affected, sadly.so," she
said, "but at least they leave me
with mf sight clear ; yes, thank
Heaven, I .am not blindfold in my'
own house; I must confesgI can see!"
"And few people, my dear, have'
such lovely eyes to see with."
Madame Beiioni turned away her,
face to hide the flush of satisfaction
that her husband's remark called
up, and then said: "-0 my dear,

nobody knows what I suffer ; I own,
openly, that my heart is breaking.
I had thought that, when I was con-
fined to my room,-some one would
have the delicacy -yes, I must use
that word, although I regret that I am
forced to do so - to see that things
went on with equal propriety as if
I were myself present. Ah, Mon-
sieur I3enoni, I never was made for
your laisser aller Italian natures.
When you are young, it is all inten-
sity; when old, all indifference. I
am glad, at least, that Marcello has
some of my blood in his veins, al-
though his conduct of late has little
in it on which my eye can rest with
pride."
"Why, my dear, what has Mar-
cello done ? " said her husband, rais-
ing his spectacles, and looking rather
quizzically under them.  " I hope he
has not been making love to the
maid!"
"There are certain things, Mon-
sieur Benoni, so entirely repulsive to
one's nature, that any one with even
the slightest shadow of susceptibility
to those more delicate feelings would
he influenced by them, but it is with
exquisite pain that I see you so de-
void of this sensibility ; however, I
will not notice your remark. I will
leave it as if unsaid. I will not
dwell upon it, as it would be 'too
painful to my more refined manner
of considering certain subjects. It
is true that I was brought up in
Italy, and that my father was an
Italian; but from my mother, I must
confess I am glad to say, I inherited
all my happy prejudices in extreme
-youth."
"Well, my dear, I am glad too,

and that that youth has not passed
as yet !"
"Your flattery falls on me un-
heeded, Monsieur Benoni; indeed, I
may say it is utterly distasteful to
me. All I ask is --and I must
confess it does not seem to me that
I am requesting too much from. a
husband, when I say that I should
have wished a slight surveillance in
this house;- something for others
that you would have wished for your
own girls, if it is only putting it on
the ground of doing unto others as
you would be done unto."
"My love, will you favor me with
an instantaneous explanation of the
terrible vengeance that seems to be
hanging over this house like a colos-
sal sword of Damocles ?"
"Your style is, as usual, exagger-
ated, Monsieur Benoni; but is it
possible that you have not seen that
Miss Strihling is doing her best, I
may say her very best, to ensnare
our son? that all her faculties are
bent, since her return, upon this sole
object ? Not that I fear for him, still
I do not wish this thing to continue;
the bare thought of it has so affected
my bead that I feel as if brain fever
might set in at any moment."
"My dear child, allow me to say
that I have noticed nothing of the
kind, and, even if I had I should
not interfere with the course of
events in any way. I think nothing
better could happen to Marcello
than to find a good wife, and surely
he could not easily find one more
attractive, better educategwyith more
true refinement than Mademoiselle
Str~hling. Money he does not need
to look for,-he has sufficient; it is

because she did not love me,.- mark
the simple fact,-not in the least
because my position was higher than
hers. ,I do not intend dying of a
broken heart, but I do mean to re-
main her faithful friend through

his mother. firmly in the face, "if
you should in any way make this
house disagreeable to Mademoiselle
Strolling, so  that she  should  be
forced to leave' it, you will lose at
the same time, as an inmate of your
household, your son. Have you any-
thing else, Madame, to say to me? I
am at your command."
"Nothing," she said, "save that I
hope you enjoyed digging my grave
with your own filial hands !"
Marcello was the only person in
the world who knew  how to govern
his mother ; she was proud of him
because he was fine-looking, clever,
and gentlemanly, but she had very
little companinship with him, and
her nervous 4cesses, as she called
them, were ways slighted if he
happened to be present.  She was a
little afraid of him, -afraid of his
ridicule and his keen satire. Mar-
cello bowed and left the room with-
out answering her.
CHAPTER XI.
"(NE of these cards is'for you,
M Mademoiselle Str~ihling," said
lMarcello, who had taken from the

silver waiter several notes that the
-servant had handed him. "I know
the fair hand, I think, that penned
it ; and :here is one for me!"
Ina opened it. "It is an invita-
tion for a dinner next week, on Fri-
day, at Madame de Turenne's," she
said.
" You willgo, I hope ? " said Mon-
sieur Bertani, who was looking fix-
edly at Ina. "I received my invi-
tation yesterday."
"Which means that you think
ours were sent as a second thought,"
said Marcello.
"Not at all; it merely means that
I hoped you were asked, and feared
you were not, because you had not
mentioned it, and dared not put the
question for fear of giving myself
too great a disappointment. Shall
you go, Mademoiselle Strohling 2"
"Yes," said Ina, returning his gaze.
"iDo you not think, Mademoiselle
Strhling," said Marcello, " that Ber-
tani is rather like the gogl Jupiter,
afraid sometimes of showing his fire,
lest it should burn up those he most
loves in its flames? That is the rea-
son, I suppose, that he has given us,
his best friends, so little of it of late."
"Why, what do you mean, Mar-
cello ?"
"I mean that you are not your-
self, that you have not been yourself
for the last month."
" And who, pray, is my Semele ?"
"Not Madame de Turenne surely;
she would stand any amount of heat."
"I shall become her champion if
you run her down."
"She would make a perfect Kuni-
gunda, Bertani. Pardon me, I think
mny mother called."


72                                INA.

It was the first time that Bertani
had been left alone with Ina since
she came, save that short interview
in the library the first evening of
her arrival. The young girls had
retired for the night, Monsieur Be-
noni had gone to his club, and
Madame Benoni had sent word that
she should not receive that evening.
Bertani had been there every day
after dinner, since Ina came from
Lucerne ; his hour was generally
from -eight to nine, but the parlor
was always full, and Ina and he
rarely spoke together, save for a mo-
ment,. when every eye might be-
upon them. Ina sat motionless ;
she did not spring to Bertani's side
as she would have done .a month
ago.; she felt as if she were rooted
to- the spot, and her eyes fastened
down by leaden weights.
" Ina,', he said, "you are sadly
changed ; you look like the pale
shadow of her I once wooed. Do you,
think Marcello suspects anything?"
" I have never thought about it at
all."a
"Ina, you do, not .love me any
more. It is three weeks since I
have watched for one look of love
from. your eyes."
"Do you think," she said, "that
love is always at your command ?,
that it is like an Eastern slave, to
come at your slightest beck? Do
you ask a harp, after you have taken
away all its strings, why it does' not
give forth the music it uttered be-
fore ? Do yot cut away the wings of
a bird, and say, Why does it not soar
through. the air for my amusement
as it once did ? Can you lIeave a
flower without the suiilight to warm

it, or water to refresh it, and expect
to find it vivid in color, and filling
the air with its fragrance.? This is
what you have done to me ! There is
no more music in my heart, no more
swift-winged flight through a world
of illusions, no more basking in the
warm sun."
"You are bitter."
I am what you have made ine,"
Bertani's heart was touched. There
was indeed no more life in Ina's face;
all those varied emotions that once
played over it like light on the prism
were gone ; her voice was no longer
the gay echo of a glad soul, it was
hushed, and seemed to touch only
one sad chord.
"I am," she said, after a few min-
utes' pause, "the Semele who have
been scathed and burnt to my soul,
not by a great fire that would have
flashed light into my eyes,- but
parched and shrivelled away by a
burning fever. You were the god
that humbled yourself to come to
one so low ; you descended from your
heaven of ambition, and filled me
with 'immortal longings,' and then
left me to live in the dust as I
might."
" Ina, have you forgotten that we
have a bond to bind us which can-
not be snapped ? Is there not a bright.
bud on your leafless plant that shall'
yet bloom for us both ? "    '
" What is our child to us ?" she
said.; "far away from us both, as yet
he has no mother or father! 0 0Eman-
uele," she said, suddenly rising and'
standing before him, " give me your
name, not for me, not for myself,--
I have almost grown not to care for
myself, - but for him ; he is so

sweet, and if you could see him smil-
ing in his innocent sleep -"  She
clasped her hands before her, and
stood, her eyes filling with tears,
looking so lovely in her helplessness
that Bertani felt how he had wronged
her; a genuine feeling of remorse,
love, and pity swept over him, and,
he knelt down before her.
"Ina," he said, "-all shall be right,
all shall be well. I will forget my
country, my dreams of ambition, all
for you; only say that you forgive
and forget the past."
There was no answer from Ina,
only a low suppressed sob.
"Ina, you will break my heart if
you do not speak. I never knelt to
any woman before, - will you let
me rise without one word of love
from your lips ?  Speak to me then
for our child's sake ! Ina, I. love
you! The clouds shall vanish from
your young life. I will take you ge-
fore all the world as my wife, and if
there be any blame attached to what
has been, I will accept it as mine."
"0 Emanuele, do I hear you truly
say those words ? I cannot yet be-
lieve my own happiness," she said,
as she sank into his arms. " I have
suffered so much that I cannot wake
from it ; my soul seems almost stub-
born. I do not know how it all was,
but in those days of silence and .lone-
liness, when I thought I never should
again see you alone, every evening
when you had gone such dull despair
crept over me that I could not even
weep. I could not believe yon were
the same who had sat at my feet,
who had covered me with flowers, on
whose shoulder my h.ead had so often
laigr! Ah, I thought I should go mad!"

"And now, dearest, will you smile
again ? ". kissing her on her eyes and
lips.
" Yes," she said, looking up at him
with a radiant smile breaking all
over her face. "Is it possible that
one breath of happiness can so anni-
hilate the past ? It is too sudden,
too much," she said, covering her face
with her hands.
Emanuele kissed her- hands; he
spolge to her as of old ; he held her to
him, looking in her eyes as if he
could not weary of their depths.
"Do you know," he said, looking
at her, "that you make me feel Pyg-
malion's rapture; it seems as if you
were -just wakening into life. I see
the roseate blood stealing over your
hands and face, and the new life'
stirring in every vein. Ah, Ina, you
are beautiful thus ! I have never in
my life desired so much to be an
artist as when I have watched you
in all your grace; and yet," he said,
laughing, "I knew you were not
beautiful, but there    was always
something so nameless about you,
that I could study you like a poem.
I thought of you alternately as Iphi-
genia, Electra, Romilda, Virginia, all
that was noble, maidenly, and high;
it was through my imagination that
you addressed my senses. Ah, Ina,
my own German love, more lovely in
your mystic ideality than our wo-
men in their impassioned reality, tell
me that you forgive me, and that you
will bloom again into life."
Ina was too blessed to speak; he
had indeed watered and sunned his
flower, which had sprung into fra-
grant blushes'agavin for him.
" I used to think sometimes," she

said, of those English lines I liked
so much,--      ,-
'Our cedars must fall around us
Before we see the light';
but I saw only the darkness when
I thought mine had fallen around me.
o Emanuele, it is so sweet to be
happy, so fearful to suffer ! I do not
think such pain does one good; mine
only made me bitter and hard."
"I trust it is past now, Ina, only
that it may be my Ina of other days ;
you know I cannot bear sorrow, my
whole being   shrinks from  it.  I
would not say, on bidding farewell to
the \world, as Jupiter did, 'Niemand
soll glicklich sein.' *  I would have
every one glad. And now, my love,
good night; rest well let your motto
be, 'Courage et espdrance,' or rather
take that of Charles the Fifth, 'J'at-
tends mon astre'; have patience yet a
little,and believe that all will be right."
"0, I will," said Ina. " I cannot
bear to have you go. Good night."
Emanuele Bertani went away with,
a freshly awakened love for Ina in
his heart. His character was , a
strange mixture of unruly elements,
-extremely Epicurean, and without
faith; with'a nature that was alive
to all that was sensuous, enjoying
t ie perfume of a flower, the- warm
s nlight, or a woman's beauty, with
a intensity which is rare; full of
intellectual power, with 'a brain. that
was capable of severe work seven-
teei hours out of the twenty-four ;
yet he was' not capable -of feeling
any one thing long. Whether he
had~a heart or no, it was difficult to
tell; trouble, as he said, distressed
him, because he believed' that this
* "No one shall be happy,"

world was meant for enjoyment. ;he
felt all things with vivid keenness
for the moment, then it was past.
When 'he had seen Ina that evening,
so lovely in her sorrow, his first im-
pulse had been truly, as he said, to
repair all the evil done ; but his
ambition was his evil genius, and
when he was not immediately under
the influence of some peculiar charm,
his good resolutions vanished as if
they had never existed. He occupied
a high position and did good to his
country, still he did not labor for
that, but for himself; and had he
thought that his own path to dis.
tinction would be just as well secured
through unscrupulous actions, had
they been more in harmony with
his own private desires, he would
not have hesitated to employ any
means. Quick to feel 'sympathy,
that sympathy must not cost him
the  slightest  sacrifice.  Ina  had
given him fresher, truer, deeper sen-
sations than any other woman ever
had; he had not grown weary of
her, but she had ceased to be a nov-
elty, and the interest had palled.
When he conversed so interestingly
of his country's progress, of the ne-
cessity of her waking to a new life,
of the demand for men of strength,
honor, and action; when he spoke of
the corrupting influence of priests,
the false glamour of French litera-
ture, the need of pure morals and a
high standard, --he was earnest, elo-
quent, and convincing.    It was not
that he was deceiving others, he was
only unconsciously deceiving him-
self ; he felt what he said intellec-
tually, not morally ; his expression
was warm and fervid, and he thought

at the time that he was the heroic
advocate of all that was good and
high; he forgot that in his soul, if
he had one, he did not care at all
about any of the arguments he was,
so warmly pleading. He loved art,
science, and learning, not for them-
selves, but merely because the knowl-
edge and appreciation of them gave
him a sense of power in himself ;
each step gained Was a height above
the common herd, from which he
could look down upon his fellow-
men. He might have been great ;
as it was, he was like a broken statue,
like a grand-ship without a rudder,
at the mercy of the waves of passion
and selfish 'ambition.
That evening when Ina went to
her room, her poor heart was young
again, the dead weight 'was gone
frbiu it ; she knelt down and thanked
God that Emanuele loved her ; she
prayed that she might ever peep that
love, and she felt strong in the sense
of youth and hope. She wrote to
Sofi, and poured out to her all her
new happiness ; she sent thousands
of kisses to her darling, and she
knew that she was immeasurably
blessed. The week passed quickly;
she had not again had a chance to
speak with her husband alone, but
she had met his eye often, fixed on
her, with the look of those first days
in them when she first woke tremu-
lously to life and'love. Once they had
passed him in the street in the coach,
and Ina had   seen, him   standing
looking back until they were out of
sight; once he had handed her a
book before -Madanme Benoni, and as
he did so, had hastily pressed her
hand ; they were little things, but

it is the food on which love feeds,
and without which it dies, and Ina
had carried them all in her heart, as
a saint would sacred relics. They
were enough for her to live on, aid
she was willing to wait now, putting
her trust in him, and feeling sure
that it would not be long. And
then she was to meet him at the
dinner, and all her pulses beat to-
wards that time ; he would perhaps
speak with- her there, they should
have some moments apart ; where
there were to be so many persons,
they would escape observation. Who
knows but that, wandering on his
arm, he would lead her to some room
to see a certain picture, a.nd there,
alone, he would speak words of love
to her, and tell her when he would
reveal their secret to Madame Be-
noni, then to the world ; he would
speak to her of their child, - and she
stretched out her arms to it, as if to
callit to come to her. Ina had ordered
a plain white corded silk, at the
suggestion. of Madame Benoni, whose
fear of her son had made her very
thoughtful of late in her manners to
Ina; then'she was not bad-hearted,
only completely' and selfishly ab-
sorbed in her own petty complaints,
and filled to ovrflowing with a happy
vanity and self - complacency; she
cared not much what others did, so
that she herself was not disturbed,
and the idea that Ina had refused
her son,, instead of wounding her
pride for him, had rather raised Ina
in her estimation. She said to her
often: " Mademoiselle Strbhling, you
are a sensible young woman ; yes, I
must confess that I have the highest
respect, the truest esteem, for you;

INA.

7.5


INA.                          77

you are one of thefew young women
forwhom Iprofess to feel real respect."
Ina did not know why Madame
Benoni repeated these-words to her
so frequently of late; she contented
herself that she pleased her in any
way. Ina's dress had come home,
and she had tried it on; it was very
simple, but elegant ; the neck was
cut low, and filled up with tulle
puffings. She was glad it was so
pretty. Friday came, and with it two
exquisite bunches of flowers, - one
was from Bertani, she knew it, for it
had just in the centre a white im-
mortelle, the flower Ina used to wear
in her breast in Switzerland, and
there was, no name on the card ac-
companying it; the other from Mar-
cello, -and she was dressed by Ma-
dame Benoni's own maid. She did'
not wear any ornament save a row of
pearls around her throat that Eman-
uele had given her the day before
she left Turin for her marriage. She
had arranged her hair herself; it
was simply brushed off her-face in
great golden waves, and twisted
around  her delicate-shaped  head,
drooping a little in her throat. She
looked so white, so graceful and
evanescent, as she stood there, that
she could not help feeling a slight
flush of pleasure passing over her
face as she looked at herself reflected
in the large adrnoire a glace, and-
thought that ,he would be, perhaps,
proud to know that she was his.
When she went into the parlor, she
found Madame Benoni there with
her son. Monsieur Marcello looked
at her, and she ssaw ,the expression
of admiration that filled his eyes as
they rested on her; it gave her a-

moment's pleasure. Madame Benoui,
reclining in her black velvet on the
sofa, that she might rest her shat.
tered nerves even until the moment
of departure, said with her more
than usually languid tones: "Well,
my dear,   must confess that you are
looking rmarkably well. I never
should dream that you were a gov-
erness; should you, Marcello ?"
"I think," he said, quietly, "that
any sensation with regard to Mad-
emoiselle Strihling would be that of
a dream, for she seems to me too ,
exquisitely shadowy to last."
Ina blushed deeply.
"My dear Marcello, allow me to
say, as she who has given you birth
has a right to remark, that your ob.
servations are in bad taste. I think
they would jar upon nerves much
stronger than mine. Prose is the
law of life ; it is its strength, and
practicality is its staff. Poetry is all
very well for Italian  lrovatores, but
I must confess that I think it out
of taste in a country that has noth-
ing to do with the medievo.- Why
do you not say simply, .' Mademoi-
selle Strihling looks well' ? that
would suffice."
"Simply because, Madame, it would
not in any way convey an idea of
my feelings. I cannot say that Mad-
emoisell   Strihling  looks  merely
well, when I think she looks, as I
said before, like a perfect dream of
loveliness.".
Ina 'looked distressed. Madame
Benoni was just winding herself up
for a long harangue, when fortunate-
ly the carriage was announced.
" Permit me," said Marcello, with
a malicious smile, "to help you on

with your cloak. If I may once
touch you I shall feel more comfort-
able, more certain that you will
not suddenly escape like la belle
Helne into air, leaving your gar-
ments in the (ms of a despairing
Faust behind you!"
"This is 'too silly," said Madame
Benoni; "this is, I must confess,
foolish beyond my comprehension !"
and she passed out in dignified dis-
pleasure before her son.
"I entreat you," said Ina, in a low
voice, "if you value my peace of
mind, not to irritate Madame Be-
noni against me."
"There is no danger," said, Mar-
cello, laughing, and offering her his
arm; but Ina drew back, and pointed
hastily for him to go to his mother's
side.
"Your loving mother, Hamlet !"
he said, and sprang, laughing, to his
mother's side. Ina could not help
smiling too, but she turned away her
face to hide it, not, however, before
Marcello had caught a glimpse of:
the pretty curve around her lips.
They soon arrived at Madame de
Turenne's, were ushered up stairs to
her room. Ina glanced around at it;
a feeling of wondering curiosity
came into -her mind as to whether
Madame de Turenne, with all her
brilliancy, her wealth, her adorers,
was happy or no.  She thought she
should like to look through her eyes,
down into her heart.  It was strange,
,but Ina felt a curious interest in
everything in  this *chamber.  She
looked at the bed, curtained with
lace and amber satin damask, and
thought to herself, " Has she ever
Wept on those pillows ?" 'There was

a fragrance of perfume in the roon,
which was not strong, but just the
most delicate souppon. There was a
picture of Madame de Turenne over
the luxuriously tufted sofa. ' It was
taken so that it could expose as
much as possible, without positive
indecency, her beautiful form;, she
was apparently en chemise, but this,
her only article of clothing, was of
the most transparent batiste. No
trousseau from Paris could furnish
forth a texture more exquisite in its
subtle fineness. Her arms and neck
were perfect; her hair was falling in
quantities of, dark curls over her
white shoulders; her face was hand-
some, with dark, passionate eyes.
Ina stood for a moment rapt in
interest, gazing at this portrait; then
she turned away with a sigh.' The
room was filled with objets de godt,
Cupids holding lights behind alabas-
ter lamps. In the middle of the
room there was a table with a tiny
fountain in it; the water rose quite
high, and splashed back, with a
pretty rippling sound, over a lovely
alabaster Venus, who was raising her
hand as if to push away the waters
and escape from them. On the
toilet-table  there were  ring-cases
dazzling with rings, and a diamond
necklace thrown carelessly over the
pincushion on which was- embroi-
dered Madame de Turenne's mono-
gram, as if she had meant to return
and clasp it on her neck. From one
side  of the room     the  windows
opened into a conservatory full of the
rarest flowers, and birds were flying
amongst the plants in happy free-
loin. Ina looked through the long
glasses, and said to herself, " How

lovely it looks! This isenchantment
just what he would like; this is
truly Armida's palace."
"Are you ready," said   farcello,
looking in at the door, " or are you
too fascinated by this magic spell, as
most of Madame de Turenne's ad-
mirers are?"
"Come, my dear,"' said Madame
Benoni. "It is time to go into the
salon."
They passed through room after
room; at last they heard the buzz of
voices, and the waiter threw open the
door, announcing them by name as
they passed in. Madame de Turenne
advanced graciously to meet them.
She was dressed in a green satin
trimmed with white'lace ; a diamond
necklace with emeralds around her
throat, a large bunch of scarlet gera-
niums in her bosom, and a wreath
of the same in her hair ; she looked
magnificent. Ina's eyes were fixed
on her. She thought of her picture
upstairs, and wondered if Emanuele
had ever seen it ; she hoped not.
There were about twenty-five people
present besides themselves. Bertani
was standing near the mantel; he
was talking with another gentleman.
" Follow me, will you not, Madem-
oiselle Strihling ? there is a seat near
me ; and follow Mademoiselle Stroh-
ling, Monsieur Marcello ! you could
not be in the wake of more lovely
foam than her white dress makes as
she moves." And she took Ina's
hand, and led her to the sofa. "Per-
mit me, Madame Ia Contessa Gual-
terio, Mademoiselle Str~hling. I have
spoken to you of her, Nina ; this is
my best friend, Mademoiselle ! I hope
you will like each. other."

The Countess said she was very
glad to meet Ina, that she had often
heard Madame de Turenne speak of
her. "She has taken such a fancy
to you."
"She is very kind," said Ina.
The Countess looked at Ina with
interest, and said: "I do not won.
der she has told me so much about
you ;' you are such a striking contrast
to all of us. I can understand why
the Italian masters ran away from
our dark hair to catch the golden
light of those beautiful blondes."
Just then, before Ina had time to
reply, dinner was announced. Ma.
dame de Turenne glided over to
where B ertani was standing, and,
taking his arm, said laughing, and in
a low voice : " This is the advantage
of having an entertainment in one's
own house, one can choose one's
knight; will you lead me in to din-
ner ?"
"I would follow you anywhere,"
he answered; " but you will lead me
where you choose." .
" Into temptation ?" she said light-
ly.
"Into. Dante's own Inferno," he
said, laughing, "which you would
transform into a Paradise."
"That would not be easy," she
said. "Dante seems to take very
little account of us women, and, with
the exception of a few, to think it
little matter where we are. I sup-
pose that is the reason you quote
him  so often."S
They passed in to the dinner.
Each person's name was placed in
his plate, Ina sat lower down, be.-
tween Marcello and another gentle-
man whom she had never met before,.

"I did not know," said Madame
de Turenne, "whether it was best to
let you each choose your seats, to
leave it to chance, or to place you
myself. I decided upon the last
method, and all ladies who are not
satisfied are at full liberty to chal-
lenge e after dinner. As for the
gentlemen, they naturally Will be
perfectly happy in being honored by
the presence of any of our lovely sex
at their sides!"
"Our first brindisi," said Bertani,
"shall be for our beautiful hostess ;
our next shall be to all those who
come within her magic circle!"
"You are too flattering," she said.
"Flattery is merely truth when
addressed to you!"
"Flattery," she said, "is like the
sparkling  bubbles in  champagne ;
without it society would be dull and
vapid indeed, as that would be with-c
out its gas."
"And how do you think we live
without it," said Bertani, "since it
is only a delicate flower that can be
offered to women?"
"You! Monsieur Bertani, do you1
speak of yourself in the plural, as if 
you were royalty ? You drink it in in
great intoxicating draughts every day I
of your life ; you have it in theta
Chamber,,in the Senate, in the King's
palace, and," she said, lowering her
eyes, and playing with the flowers inF
her breast, "in women's eyes."      t
"Would that I did !" said Bertani;s
"that would be the sweetest of all." 1
Madame de Turenne raised her
eyes, and gave him a look, and then I
cast them down again. -
"oyou not think," she     said,
"that Mademoiselle Ina is just like c

a picture? I always try to make
people happy. I cannot bear not to
see people glad.' I am like you, Mon-
sieur Bertani, I would like to live
with my wings always spread out in
the sunlight. I have fixed my heart
upon a match between her and lMar-
cello; he is such a charming fellowv!
It is very generous," she said, with
another side glance at Bertani, "for
me to say so, for he utterly despises
me; but I would be so glad if they
could marry each other."
"Do .you think he fancies her, - I
mean, loves her ?"
" 0 Monsieur Bertani," fixing her
large eyes in wonder upon him, "can
you not see plainer,-you who are
always there, as Madame Benoni tells
me, always ? She is happier than most
women "; this was said with a little
sigh.  "Do you not see that Mar-
cello has no eyes save fir her? and
indeed I do not wonder, for she is one
of the sweetest-looking creatures I
ever saw. I only wonder that others
too are not, like Marcello, lost in her
charms. Poor thing, how sad it is to
be- a governess ! it is mere slavery.
It must be dreadful to live in a house
with Madame Benoni, to be under
her rgine ! - I should go mad. And
then, too, in the position of a depend-
ant !"
Emanuele winced. "You are gen-
erous indeed," he said, "to give her
the one man in the world that is'not
at your feet ; only you ought first to
have conquered him, then slain him
with a look, and, when quite dead,
have handed his corpse to Madem-.
oiselle Strbhling."
"You are cruel to me,"-..she said,
~oloring deeply.

"Are you quarrelling with Bertani ?"
said Marcello, who had looked up
and seen her angry color. "Beware !
He is a dangerous enemy, and, I fear,
a dangerous friend."
"I was only trying," said Bertani,
r'to convince Madame de Turenne
that a little mercy was butjustice to
her many victims."
" Dois-je prendre un baton pour
les mettre dehors ?" said Marcello.
"Pour vous mettre dehors, oui,"
said Madame de Turenne, laughing.
"How lovely that little Cupid is !"
said La Contessa Gualterio. "What is
it doing ? " pointing to a sugar Cupid
raised on a pyramid.
"Raising his bow to aim full at the
impenetrable heart !" said Marcello.
"Which one ?" said the Countess,
innocently.
"You will, know by the first cry
of pain you hear."
Madame de Turenne was watching
Emanuele. He felt her eyes, and
turned suddenly ; she lowered hers
and colored.
She broke out a rose from the
bunch of flowers which was in a glass
near her, and silently placed it by-
his plate ; he took it up, as -if he
had not noticed that she had placed
it  there, and put it in his pocket,
just over his heart.
"The King asked me,/the other day
why I did not have roses always
about my person. I told him in win-
ter they would not bloom at my com-
mand, because I was not a queen. He
said he would furnish me, from his
own green-house ; is that an equivo-
cal compliment ?" she said, looking
up at Bertani...
" To such a beautiful woman as

you are, I should think it certainly
was."
"Fi done !" with a quick glance
up at him, and then down at her
flowers.
"Every woman says she despises
the King, but in her heart she is
proud to receive his attentions," said
Bertani; "he is the central point of
the nation, he represents the country,
he is an idea around which the peo.
ple rally, his name is an inspiration,
an illusion, if you will, but it ex.
ists, and women are not insensible to
those influences."
"The King must be honored," said
the Count Gualterio, who had caught
Bertani's last words, "the man dis-
appears ; it is with him as it is with
the Pope, the office veils the person,
it is the divine right; if we do not
uphold him, we should be like an
ariny without a leader. The people
need to be, awestruck; they are too
Ignorant to guide themselves, they
must be led like children."
" Aristocratic ideas, very naturally'
entertained by the nobles," said Mar-
cello, laughing. " Caste exists in Italy
as strongly as in Hindostan. Edu-
cate the people, -  that is what our
friend Bertani is always advocating,
although I do not know how he
would like it if he saw his doctrines
completely carried into effect, - edu-
cate your people, and see if they do
not soon feel the king each in him-
self.  We are still in the dark ages
here ; we are ignorant and blind."
" Heresy! heresy!" shouted Gual-
terio, " down with' him! Why, he
would set the country on fire, and
burn up all the nobles if he could.!
We used to think Bertani a radical,

but he is moderate in comparison
with Monsieur Benoni. Bertani our
minister forever !" he said, raising
his glass. All the company filled
theirs and drank to the minister.
Camilla touched his glass," I drink
to you," she said in a low voice, "not
to your title ; if I drank to the King
it would not be to his crown."
" lie would forget that he wore one
whilst watching your lovely lips.".
"Bertani," said the Count Gual-
terio, "what was that the Cabinet
agreed upon the other day in their
last sitting ?
Bertani turned away to answer;
the conversation had become general
again.
Madame de Turenne rose. "I de-
test politics," she said, '-when there
are ladies present." Bertani offered
his arm to her. They all left the
table.
"Are you jealous ?" she said.
"Of whom ? I must know who my
adversary is, before I honor him with
such a sentiment."
"I mean, should you be? Of the
King, for instance?"
No,.I am   not, nor could I be,"
said Bertani.
"You really then despise me, not
laughingly qs Marcello does, but se-
riously," looking up at him, with two
large tears starting in her beautiful
eyes.
" I should despise myself if I did."
"0 Monsieur Bertani, you are so
strong in yourself, so superior to all
the men I ever knew, that I feel;for
the first time in my life, a sensation,
ofmistrust when with you; it seems
to mue as if no arts, nio superficial
charms, would have any effect on

you, - as if I must be, not seem, to
make you my friend, to win your
esteem, your friendship."
"I should feel myself indeed truly
honored if I might claim the title of
your friend."
"You know," she said, smiling,
"that it is yours without asking
for it."
" I have been called proud, Ma-
dame de Turenne, but you give me a
right to be so'!"
A gentleman came up to the host-
ess just at that moment, and Bertani
left her side ; he went to Ina, who
was standing alone.
"You are looking lovely," he said,
"as Madame de Turenne has just
been saying." Ina smiled. " Who
gave you those flowers ?"
" The bunch that was anony-
mous ?'
"No, the one that had a name."
"When you tell me," she said
archly, "who it was that sent those
that. had no clew to betray them
save the welcome they found in my
heart, I will tell you the name of the
person who sent me the others."
"Marcello Benoni is paying you
his court."
"Are you paying yours to Ma-
dame de Turenne ? " was the playful-
reply.
" A man is free," he said, laughing,
"to court whom he will, but a wo-
man is in a very different position."
" And I tell you," she said, " that
a woman, as she does not -take the
initiative, is never to be blamed;-
she passively stands and receives;
but he who goes forward, and acts
and says and does, is the one to be
judged."

"I scarcely recognize my Ina,"
he said, lowering his voice. "Do you
know, when you entered -the room
with our hostess, I thought of the
Queen of Sheba going to meet Solo-
mon in all his glory, and the Virgin
Mary being met by the angel of the
annunciation ; the lilies seemed ,all
around you in your white dress!"
" Will you permit me," said Ma-
dame de Turenne, " to present to
you Le Marquis de Marchini ? Come,
Monsieur, Bertani, let me deprive
Mademoiselle of the sun which is
daily hers for a few moments. " I
cannot allow you," she said, as she
left Ina, "to be under such tempting
influences for a long time.. I am ca-
pable of jealousy, although you are
not. . A lady told me the other day
that in her rage 'she had thrown
'vitriol in her rival's face ; do you
not think that was an     effective
remedy ?  She spoiled the beauty of
another woman, and lost the little
that remained to her of her lover's
heart !  Mademoiselle  Strahling's
beauty would not be difficult to
destroy because it is so delicate ;
she is very much changed since last
year, but I think she is more inter-
esting, -do not you ? But as you do
not speak to me, nor answer one
question that I put you, I shall go
and entertain my other guests."
" No, stay, yet one moment," he
said ; " one cannot get accustomed,
after so muchlnight, to be left instan-
taneously in the dark"
" When will you come to see me,
Monsieur Bertani ? your time is so
precious, one almost feels conscien-
tious about robbing you of it."
"Would that you would think it

worth one effort to steal some of
it !"
"When will you come then ? Them
is nothing I hate so much as waiting."
"'Se faire attendre, c'est se faire
aimer !'" he said, laughing ; "at least
it is a French proverb; but it would
be the most difficult to practise upon,
since whenever one begins to calcu.
late, one finishes by punishing one's-
s   Telf."
"Then you will not tell me ? I
shall wait for you all day !"
" Camille,"  said  the  Countess
Gualterio, " I want to speak to you,,
She drew her aside. "You are mak.
ing your lover wretched."
," What lover, my dear?" with
utter surprise.
"Your friend, then, your admirer,
young Marchini."
" 0," with a shrug of her should.
ders, "if I had to look out for all the
men who are wretched, I should
have little time left for my own
pleasure!" .
" You. are heartless ; last week
you dismissed poor Miro, and this
week Marchini is to be the new
victim., You will pay for this some
day or other; be sure, Camilla, that
one 'day or another you will suffer
yourself. Bertani is a dangerous
man to play with !"
"Is he ?" she said, laughing; "we
shall see ! In the mean time you
have deprived me of a delightful t&amp;1-
d-tete "   ~'     -
That evening, when all her com.-
pany was gone, Madame de Turene
sat long in her room, alone. The
splashing of her little Venus fountain
made her nervous ; she rang the bel
fois her maid to remove it to the

conservatory. She was alone again.
How distinctly the clock ticked out
the fast-flying time! She uttered an
exclamation of impatience, and put
her hand against the pendulum, td
stop its motion. , At last the lights
were extinguished, and if Ina could
have looked into that chamber, her
.question would have been answered,
for there on the pillow-case, over the
letter "C," which formed part of the
embroidered monogram, a tear glit-
tered like a large diamond.
One of Ina's bouquets was placed in
a vase of water ; the other she kissed
and held in her hand as she slept.
CHAPTER XII.

THE next morning, at
hour, Ina received

an early
a little

scented note ; it was sealed with a.
coronet, under which letters, "C. M.
T.," were intwined in red, green, and
gold; it said:-
" CARA DAMIGELLA, - Would you
favor me by allowing me to call for
you this evening on my way to the

" PREGIATA SIGNORA, - I should
be very glad to avail myself of so
delightful a manner of passing the
evening. I will tell Monsieur Mar-
cello, and I am sure he will leave
his dagger at home, and come
weaponless to your box. Monsieur
Bertani I have not seen.
"iDi lei devotissima,
"INA STROHLING."
"I have an invitation for you,"
she said to Marcello, " divine who it
is from. The fairest of her sex, yet
very dark, with eyes that would kill
and give life at once, with hands
that are warm to the touch but mar-
ble to the sight ; with a heart that
has not yet found its master, yet is
mistress of all,-who is it?"
"I read your riddle in four, and
guess at once that it is Madame de
Turenne." Marcello was glad to see
that Ina had become, during the last
few days, something of her former
self again; he did not know to what
to ascribe it, but there was an ani-
mation in her face that had nothing
in it of her former listless sadness.
It was hope that had buoyed up
poor Ina, the belief that all might

before ?
Ina hesitated a moment, and then  "You are truly flattering to me,"
wrote back:--                     he said.. "At last, after months of

devotion, after a year and a hal
of the most marked admiration, yo
have at last actually turned my hea
at once, without any preparation, b
calling, me good-hearted. I do no
know how I can stand this sudde
accession of good fortune; spare me
Mademoiselle Strihling, I entrea
you; you know I. am already an onl)
son!"
Ina smiled, and said:- "Most mei
would hold that for praise, but yon
are so spoiled by society that yoi
would have me compare you, I sup=
pose, to Leonardo da Vinci at once
He alone, I believe, combined perfect
genius, beauty, strength, and grace."
"Thank you for the suggestion,'
said Marcello,- laughing. "Yes,I
think we are alike ! it is encouraging
at least, to know that we agree upon
but one point."
"I do not wonder," said Ina,."that
Madame de Turenne finds you so
provoking. I would not ask you, as
she does, to coie with your arms
poses, but to bring them all, that
I might fight you with each suc-
cessively."
"And now, pray tell me," said
Marcello, folding his arms, "with
what noble qualities I am to endow
Madame de Turenne. She is self-
ish, for she 'only thinks of herself
and her own personal vanity, at the
expense of all others; she is heart-
less, because she would rob every
man of his heart,,and give him noth-
ing in exchange ; she is cold, because
she can play with impunity 'with
fire without feeling the flames ; she
is a finished coquette, and has every
art that a beautiful woman of the
world can produce to conquer with."

if   " Ah," said Ina, archly. "I shall
u begin to think that Monsieur Bertani
d, is right, and that disappointment
y- and wounded vanity     are rankling
t under these scathing blasts ! 'Save
n me from my friends, and I can take
, care of my enemies'; who was it
t said that ?"
y    "I do not know; it is a mis.
erable Rochefoucauldism. Never was
n particularly Madame de Turenne's
u friend. Friendship I hold to mean
u a great deal.    I am    your friend,
- Mademoiselle Strihling, because -I
. admire and respect you, because I
t believe you to be worthy, of the
noblest devotion, the purest love, the
greatest sacrifices."
"Pray, do not say these things to
, me, Monsieur Marcello. I have told
you that ,they pain me," said Ina,,
blushing deeply.
"I will not willingly offend you,
but it is hard for a man always to
chisel his words like marble. What
is the opera to be to-night ?"
" La  Favorita, I   believe.  The.
music is exquisite, but Italian," said
Ina, smiling.
"It is a good choice for Madame
de Turenne, but pray tell mie what
does that mean ?"
"It means that it is passionate,
warm,    inteiise,  quickening  one's
pulses, and hurrying    the beat of
one's heart; that it breaks on your
soul just 'as the grand waves do on
the shore, and    leaves corals and
pearls strewn on it, but that it'
leaves you also restless and dissatis
fled, and with a weary sense of
something that you have had, but
not enough. It is an exquisite per-
fume that has passed away5'

"Like the Italian   nature," said
Marcello.
"Perhaps so," said Ina, thought-
fully and with a deep-drawn sigh.
"And now tell me what is Ger-
man music?"
"It is like the depths of the sea
itself. It is still and  strange, it
responds to all in one's nature, it
excites and satisfies ; one rises to
the greatest possible heights, but
when there one is not giddy, only
wrapped in an ethereal atmosphere
soft and bracing.; one floats on' the
clouds, catches the tints of the rain-
bow, the shadows on the mountains ;
but one descends to earth ,refreshed
and elevated."
"Your definition, I believe, is true,"
said Marcello; "at least I have felt
thus; but, as Madame de Turenne
once said, the' Italians feel music
with all the nerves of their nature,
more perhaps than any nation."
"They feel it," said Ina, "perhaps,
as, they feel all things, intensely for
the time being. I believe such na-
tures suffer more, and enjoy more
acutely. But tempests cannot last
long, they would sweep over the
earth else and destroy it ; and so the
chords of human nature would be
broken if they were always swept
over by a hand that attuned them'
ever to great passions."
"Yo'n think the Germans' feelings
are more lasting, but that their
enjoyment and suffering are less ? I
would rather be an Italian, for at
least then one forgets the pangs that
are past."
"It seems to me that this may be
said of all the more northern na-
tions; there is something in that

Southern blood that touches upon
the Oriental, and that refines every
sense. If the Italians were colder,
they never would be inspired by
such divine dreams of art, but they
would also be stronger, I think, asa,
people."
"Yes," said Marcello, "they look
little at the consequences of their
actions, they are not reflective, all
with them is according to the im-
pulse of the moment ; they are
downcast by -a defeat, but they do
not seem to know how to .rally and
turn it into a victory ; they are poet-
ically patriotic, but they have not
the strength to make themselves
really  respected   at  home, and
honored abroad. It is strange that
they who have lighted the world
should stand aside in the dark them-
selves to gaze at the illumination;
and it is stranger still," he said,
smiling, "that I should be discussing
the 'Italians, as if I were not one
of them. That is my Anglo-Saxon
drop of blood that speaks ;- all
iny sympathies are with Italy, but
my reason is not here. Good morn-
ing, Mademoiselle Strdhling ; my
mother will be shocked if she comes
in to breakfast and finds me still
here. You know     she 'believes. in
early hours and work. If we all
thought that this was ennobling, and
the true strength of a.country, as it
is, we should be better off, and hap-
pier than we are."
Marcello went off with a lighter
heart than he had had in some time.
Ina 'had been so natural, he had
talked with, her just as he had done
before her long absence in Switzer-
land; he had not seen her so natural

,!

since then. What could it be that
was weighing and pressing upon her
poor heart? Bertani, Bertani! he
rose ever like a dark cloud in Ina's
horizon when he thought 'of her
and why he knew not. He never
had seen him seek an opportunity
of being alone with Ina, he had
scarcely surprised a look between
them, and yet there was a mysteri-
ous something that he did not fancy.
In the evening at eight o'clock
Madame de Turenne's coach stopped
at Madame Benoni's door. Ina threw
her opera-cloak around her shoul-
ders, ,and -she and Marcello went
down the long flight of steps to the
street. Monsieur Bertani had not
come, but Ina had handed Madame
de -Turenne's note to the servant,
saying, "If Monsieur Bertani comes
this evening, give him this note."
Madame Benoni had called Ina back,
and said, " My dear, if you have
any communications with Monsieur
Bertani, I think it would be just as
well to give them to me as to a
domestic. Not that I have any curi-
osity " (and, to do Madame Benoni
justice, this was true) "about your
correspondence, but I must say that
I think it would be as well not to
rouse suspicions in the minds of the
vulgar."
Ina had blushed painfully, and,
.taking the, note from the servant's
hand, she said, "I will, upon second
thoughts, give it to Madame Benoni."
She went and handed it, taking it
out of the envelope, and pointing to
Madame de Turenne's signature.
"I thought so," said Madame Be-
noni. "I have had my own private
and particular thoughts about this

t for some time. Young widows al.
r ways have such an influence. I be.
lieve our friend Bertani would go
unscathed through a whole thicket
of darts; but just one feather from
her hand, and, sure as fate, he falls."
Ina  started; her color left her
pale -as a lily again. This terrible
thought had never even entered her
mind.' Bertani had made her wretch.
ed enough, she ahad suffered agonies
in her loneliness, she had been
through   all  those   heart-rending
doubts and fears as to whether or
no he loved her as he used ; but her
. misery had taken no such definite
form as this.  It was ambition, poli-
tics, the country, that she held as her
ready- rivals, not any one woman.
A thousand uncertain shadows had
risen in her mind, but that the wo-
man who was always- so marked in
her attentions to her should be bent
on robbing her of her all,-she had
not thought of this ! and then; too,
just as her heart was beating into
life again. He had looked at her
with those dark eyes as he used; he
had held her again in his arms, had
promised her. everything she most
wished   on earth, and   yet in the
midst of her new-flushed happiness
she felt that all was uncertain in her
grasp. She felt it, and refused to
confess to herselfthat she did so. 0
God, was all the old misery coming
flooding back, to drown her moment's
peace ? was there never an hour's
rest on   earth? .All these dreary
thoughts rushed across her mind as
she followed Marcello to the, coach.
He had offered her his arm, but she
had not heeded his offer. Madame
de Turenne looked out of the car-

riage window, and said, hurriedly,
"qEt Monsieur Bertani ?"  It struck
on Ina's heart like g stiletto, it gave
her such sudden pain.
"It was so good of you to come,"
said Madame de Turenne. " I gen-
erally have to ask some dull, elderly
person to matronize me. It is de-
lightful to play the matron myself.
I am so proud too of my own re-
sponsibility."
"Mademoiselle Strohling is not a
foil," said Marcello, laughing ; " she
may be the shield that shall turn
aside two or three darts that have
been aimed at the beautiful Madame
de Turenne."
"0, I can willingly spare several
of my feigned admirers," said Ma-
dame de Turenne, laughing also, "if
they had not. the good taste them-
selves to choose Mademoiselle Stroh-
ling."
"Beware," said Marcello, -" be-
ware of jealousy, the green-eyed
monster !"
"Indeed, I would give them    all
gladly away, with the exception of
one."
Ina started; who could that one
be? She had said it so lightly, but
many a true-word is spoken in jest !
Ina had herself once told Bertani
that she could be as jealous as Ros-
munda. She did not dream     then
that he would ever-give her cause tot
be so. Now she was jealous, terri--
bly so; she felt sick with jealousy.I
She looked over at Madame de Tu-
renne; she had on a white ermine
cloak; it -contrasted so wonderfully
with her dark hair ! Ina never
knew before that she was so beauti-
fuL. She wondered that she had not

seen it at first; she had always
thought her handsome, but she
varied very much, and there were
times when Ina had not admired her
so much; now she looked dazzling in
the dim light. As she leaned back in
the coach it was with a sense of relief
that Bertani was not there to see her
as she did. They drove on in silence.
" Are you not' well to-night, Mad-
emoiselle Strohling ?"
" Yes," said Ina, "but I have a
bad headache."
"I never had that in my life,"
said Madame de Turenne.
"No, nor the heart-ache either,"
said Marcello ; " that is to come !
'The greater is behind !' as 'in the
witches' prophecy."
"I have no doubt," said Madame
de Turenne, "that you would gladly
see me pierced through and through,
but that .never will be. I should
have too much pride to choose where
I was not chosen, and so there will
be no obstacle to my happiness ;
you will not be gratified, Marcello !"
The carriage drew up to -the bril-
liantly lighted opera-house; they en-
tered. Several young men with white
cravats were lounging around the
vestibule ; they bowed to Madame de
Turenne as she passed.   "What a
contrast !" one of them said to the
other. " I wonder who she is ! Ma-
dame de Turenne is safe in bringing
a blond beauty with her ; at least
there cannot be any comparison be-
tween them." "No," said the other
young gentleman, "chacun a son
gonit!" "She must be English; she
is really lovely, -so white, with that
perfectly-golden hair ! why, her hair
is a dream in itself. I must go and

inquire who she is."   " No, here
comes Georgioni; he always knows
who everybody is."' " Yes, but he
will be sure to say something disa-
greeable, and I do not want to have
my illusion broken up so soon; so I
am going to find out in the best way
myself, by paying a visit to Madame
de Turenrde's box." Madame de Tu-
renne had seated herself with her
back to the stage ; she insisted on
Ina's taking the seat that fronted on
it. They had hung-up their cloaks, the
overture had already begun. Madame
de Turenne was dressed in black vel-
vet, her neck and arms were bare,
® and contrasted well with her dress;
she had a diamond necklace around
her throat. Ina had.on a pearl-col-
ored silk, a white illusion cape over
her shoulders, and her pearls around
her neck. °There could not have been
two more, different types than they
were ; each seemed to -heighten and
enhance the beauty and peculiar
charms of the other. They seemed
to set each other off, and 'neither
knew that each was closely examining
the other with a feeling of envy.
"How fair you are !" said Madame
de, Turenne to Ina; "'you are as
white as snow."
"Both inside and outside," said
Marcello.
"Which 'you. cruelly mean cannot
be said of the lady opposite her;
you cut like a diamond, neatly, but
you do, your work well."
Ina was looking intently on the
stage., Camilla's eyes were wandering
through the parquet; she had not
seen him enter yet. ,
" It is delightful," said Madame de
Turenne, "to see anybody so inter-

ested in the stage.  We old theatre.
goers behave shamefully; we always
think it elegant to look ennuyed aud
generally bored; we talk all the time,
drown the music, and dispirit the
singers; it is only when there I
some especial star, or some particular
air. that pleases us, that we listen
with any attention."
"Yes, but then we listen so wholly,
so intensely, that it makes 'up for all
our previous indifference."      '
"To those , few   that we flatter
thus, but not to the others, I ima.
gine. I always feel sorry for the
poor things, it is so hard not to be
the first."
Ina glanced at her, and saw the
color mount and mount again into
her face. She followed the direction
of her eyes, and in the box just oppo.
site she saw Monsieur lertani; he
held an opera-glass in his hand, and
was looking over towards their loge,
Camilla smiled and cast down her
eyes.  Ina looked quickly away at
the stage ; presently she glanced over
again, and he had disappeared,'-
surely he was coming over to them!
The 'door of their box opened, but it
was not he. The first entre-acte had
begun.   Camilla was full of anima-
tion; she presented all the gentlemen,
that entered to Ina.  " Now I know,"
she said, laughing, "*hat a pleasure
it would be to be a mother. I should
have acquired a few years, but I
should be just introducing my young
daughter into the world ; I should
have forgotten myself entirely, and
be full of projects for her future. I
think it would be delightful !"
" I am afraid," said a young bean;
who congratulated himself on heli

a bel esprit, "that you  would  be,
courted by the same admirers, like
the mother and daughter in the " Pelo
d'Oro"; that would be very bad, you
know !"
."A man would be like Hippolyte
torn between Phadre and Aricie,"
said another.
"'Ce n'est plus cette ardeur dans
mes veines cache ! "' said Camilla,
laughing. "'C'est Venus toute entire
a sa proie attachee' It would not
be difficult to feel that, incited and
stung to it by jealousy."  Her eye
rested accidentally on Ina. Ina start-
ed,. as if a snake had stung her.
"You would act the part well, Mad-
emoiselle Strdhling; that movement
was really effective !  I 'begin to
think that the Germans have quite
as much feeling as we Italians ; do
not you ? "
"I do not know," said Ina. "I have
never been both.    The god    who
tried being first a man and then a wo-
man could perhaps throw himself also
into two different nations, and have
two separate natures, I cannot." She
spoke hastily, as if she were slightly
nettled; it was true every word Ca-
milla said seemed to pierce like a
thorn into her soft flesh; she was
tired of being tortured. The second
and third act had finished, the fourth
had begun, and still Bertani did not
make his appearance. Ina said it
Was beautiful, and no sound of the
music penetrated her ears ; she saw
nothing before her eyes although she
was looking on the stage, it seemed a
great blur; she listened only with
painful intensity to every step that
approached and passed the door of
their box. Camilla's spirits too were

beginning to flag ; she had no more
ready badinage with her admirers.
There had been a crowd in her box
all the evening, but now she looked
weary, and she leaned back with a
great sigh. Just at this moment a
heavy, determined tread,-Ina knew
it so well,- the door opened quickly,
and Berta  stood before them. Ca-
milla's chee  tiat had grown pale,
flushed'now, an she regained in that
moment all her beauty, which had
lost its brilliancy during the last half-
hour.
" You have left us to ourselves all
the evening in the most unchristian
manner," said Madame de Turenne,
holding out her hand to Monsieur
Bertani.
"Your box'was filled to overflow-
ing with your most ardent admirers,
and one lorgnon besides my own has
ever been pointed this way ; next to
myself, I pitied the owner of it."
"Where ? " said Camilla. ".I have
seen neither-one nor the other."
" Look at No. 12 in the first row,"
said Bertani, " and you will see the
luckless knight-errant ; he has evi-
dently been banished from paradise
forever."
Madame de Turenne turned her
glass that way, searched for a mo-
ment in the direction that Bertani
had given, and then turned quickly,
away and colored deeply ; it was
Miro Raimondi's glass that had been
elevated all the evening to her box.
"He annoys me beyond measure,"
she said impatiently; "a man has no
right to annoy a woman."
"'My dear Madame de Turenne, it
surely is enough punishment to be
exiled from heaven, but not to be

allowed to turn one's eyes that way
is tyranny indeed."
Bertani took a seat near Ina, just
opposite Camilla. " You have been
creating quite an excitement in the
theatre this evening," he said ; "a
gentleman asked me if I knew that
pearl and that diamond that shed
lustre one on the other. I was
proud, of course, to claim almost more
than an acquaintance with both."
Camilla looked at him under ,her
eyes, and then dropped the lids; it
was a way she had. He took up her
fan, and said,, "It reminds me of
those linesin Shakespeare,-
It glows the delicate cheeks that it does cool,
And what it undoes, does.'
I could not help thinking of Cleo-
patra all this evening as I looked at
you; you might have sat for pictures
of Cleopatra and Juliet."
"Hush!" said Camilla, "this is
that lively scene at the foot of the
cross." They all turned their eyes
to the stage. Emanuele was so near
Ina that she could feel his breath
on her shoulder ; she trembled. The
prima donna had a beautiful* voice
and sang with passion, the tenor
was one of $he best then, on the
stage ; he sang " Eleonora, Eleonora,"
and she answered, "Grazie, grazie."
Her voice killed the house.
"Iddio'ti perdoni."
" E tu, Fernando,  e tu?"
There was a moment's pause, and
then he burst forth in impassioned
accents, "Si, io t'amo sempre pin."*
It thrilled through the whole theatre.
Camilla looked at Bertani under her
eyes; it was a look full of warmth, it
seemed to say, " Ed io t'amo sempre
* "I love thee evermore."

pin."  Bertani answered that glance
with one that burnt into her he t
she colored into her very hair, she
t grew pale, and colored again. Ina
saw  that' look exchanged between
them; her heart stopped      beating,
and then she felt faint, but she sat
quite still.  Then came the beautiful
duet, and then the heroine dies, and
all was over.
"Permit me," said      Bertani to
Madame de Turenne, "to help you
on   with   your  cloak."   Marcello
helped Ina on with hers, but she did
not feel it ; she only saw Bertani;
she saw him raise Camilla's long
dark curl, that hung over her white
shoulders, as he placed the cloak
under it. He thought no one was
looking at him. Ina's back was
turned, that he knew, and Marcello
was just behind her, helping her to
arrange her cloak, but there was a
small mirror opposite where they
stood. Ina's quick eye saw all in this;
he raised the curl, and pressed it to
his lips ; Camilla turned half around,
and looked up into his eyes all full
of love ; it was enough ! She stag.
gered, she grew faint. Marcello had
seen all too.
" Lean- on me," he said, and he
drew her arm   under his.   "You d
not look well."
"I am not well," said Ina, quietl ;
"for some time I have felt poorly,
but it is nothing, it will pass." They
hurried to the coach. Emanuele and
Madame de Turenne lingered behind.
Marcello opened the door of the
carriage, put Ina in, and then waited
at the door ; it was but five minutes,
but it seemed to Ina an eternity'.
Then Madame de Turenne camne-

gayly out, leaning on Emanuele's
m."Pardon me," she said, "for
keeping you waiting, but we went
back to look for my fan. I left it in
the box."
CHAPTER XIII.
THE   carriage drove off, and Ma-
dame de Turenne naturally
ordered it first to Madame Benoni's
house; here they left Marcello and
Ina.; they bade them good evening,
and then Bertani saw Camilla home.
That night poor Ina went to her
room without knowing what she did.
Monsieur Benoni was waiting for
them in the parlor ; she answered his
questions mechanically ; she told him
what opera it. was, that .it had been
beautiful, that the theatre was crowd-
ed, that the prima donna had been
called out before the curtain; she
had presence of mind sufficient to
light her candle. Marcello opened
the door for her; she said good night,
and walked slowly to her room; she
shut the door, and, was alone with
her great misery. " 0 God," she
said, "I cannot bear any more ; my
very soul is wrung to the core. Be-
,fore my face ! Does he not know
what sorrow is ? Can he love her ?
No, it cannot be; but she is doing
all she can to lure him on ; he is
a man,,- 0 God ! what shallI do ?
I must go to him, I must go to him;
I will fliig myself upon my knees
before him; I will tell him that I
san dying, that he is killing* me ;
perhaps some day he will ask for
mercy himself ! 0 Emanuele, that
look, that terrible look of love in

your eyes ! I shall go mad if I can-
not forget it ! And she,-I think
she would tempt a man to hell, with
her passionate glances. I was prais-
ing her to-day, I took her part be-
fore Marcello ; he was right, .he is
always right. 0, if I could but lie
down and sleep, and never wake
again."
Ina passed the night walking up
and down her room, like a rest-
less spirit ; all night she paced to
and fro; sometimes she would fling
open the window for air, the. blood
beat so hot in her brow and temples ;
sometimes she would suddenly go
and sit down and begin to write ;
sfie would get as far as " 0 Emanu-
ele," and then she would start up
again, and walk the room, she could
not collect her thoughts to write.
And so the morning broke, and
found poor Ina, like a wan shadow,
still walking her room; she was
weary and sick, yet she must avoid
all remark, must arrange her toilet.
She smiled a bitter smile as she
caught a glimpse of herself in the
long glass in her pearl=colored silk.
She took the pearls from her neck,
and looked at them. " They are truly
a- gift of tears," she said. She undid
her dress, and remembered how glad
her heart had been when she put it
on; and she,-what was she doing
now ? Sleeping the quiet sleep of
happiness ; with a smile of triumph
perhaps on her proud lips, as she
added Emanuele Bertani's name to
her list of conquests, in her dreams.
"0O happy Madame de Turenne ! with
all the world at her feet, could eshe
not spare me my only love ? 0 God,
my heart is breaking, it pains me

so!" Ina dressed herself now wit
care for. breakfast ; she did not wis
Marcello to . see the traces that
sleepless night had lert ; she feare
that he began to surmise some things
She went down to breakfast, bu
Marcello was not there, and Madam
Benoni, always intent alone on he
own troubles, did not take any no
tice of poor Ina's. sad eyes.
"I wish, Mademoiselle Str5hling,
Madame Benoni began, "that yoi
would take Adelheide and Maria t
the galleries; I think it is time thai
a love of art should be cultivated, I
may say created, in them. You know
my constitution is delicate, I am
not fitted to make an exertion, my
whole nature shrinks from it,' any-
thing of -the kind would fall on my
nervous system; it has been shattered
by constant anxiety, broken by the
repeated trials that an over-sensitive
frame has been called upon to bear.
Therefore it is, my dear Mademoiselle
Strdhling, that I rely so wholly on
you; I place in you a confidence
that I may say is rare, but my firm
belief is that you repay this trust
with perfect rectitude."
"What galleries shall I take them
to, Madame?"- said Ina, absently.
"It is rather fatiguing for me,
Mademoiselle Strdhling, to select the
particular placeto which you are to
take my daughters. I had thought
that I might leave that to you, but I
begin to fear that I must necessarily
expect all care to fall back on me.
I cannot free myself from it, it will
naturally wear me out in time ; but
it matters not, so long as one's duty
is clone, if one die at the mast ; that
I have always said, and I~ believe

h there are few who will not give nm

1

h credit for it."-
a    Poor Ina, who had not listened to
d what Madame Benoni was saying, on
s. hearing her allusion to a mast sud.
t denly tried to collect her ideas, and
e said " What mast?" to herself; for.
r tunately she did not give vent to her
- thoughts, and only answered, feeling
that the time had come for her to
say something, "I think I will go
u to the King's Palace." So it was
o agreed that she should take the child.
t dren in the carriage to see the pie-
tures. They were so glad, when they
heard it, that it touched Ina's heart;
she thought even if she was so mis-
erable herself, it was pleasant still
- to give some pleasure to others. In.
stead of taking their lessons that
morning they were to go to the
King's gallery; and at twelve o'clock
they drove off, that the young girls
might see those wonders of art for
the first time. Adelheide was just
fifteen, and her younger sister was
fourteen years old; but Madame Be-
noni had very strict ideas with re-
gard to young girls, and she had
never before this thought that the
time had arrived when they should in
any way be emancipated.' They set
off together, after having received a
thousand admonitions from their
mother as to the propriety of their
conduct.I
" How lovely it is," said Adelheide,
"to  be alone   with  Mademoiselle
Strdhling ! You will tell us all about
the pictures, and then we shall go to
walk in 'the gardens. 0-, it will be
delightful !" -    ..
"Yes," said Ina. She was think-
ing of the time when she too was

young, and her heart was filled and sat-
isfied by just such simple pleasures ;
but that was past now, never to come
again. They arrived at the Palace.
The girls were all excitement ; they
went up the long stairs, each flight
to their young fancies enhancing the
great mystery and charm; at last
they entered the vast rooms, one after
the other lined with immortal beauty.
laa pointed out to the girls many
of the most beautiful pictures ; she,
thought it foolish to distract their
minds with letting them linger on
all. They must seize the more strik-
ing to carry home in their mem-
ories, and then they should come
again and study them; but in every
frame, from Judith to the Madonna
della Seggiola, she seemed to see
something of Madame de Turenne's
face, and turned away with pain.
She could not divest herself of the
idea that she saw 'her eyes looking
out through each, now dusky with
passion, as in the Judith, now glo-
rified and transfigured by her holy
mission, as in the Madonna; in Ti-
tian's mistress was the same look,-
where should she go to escape those
eyes? She was wandering wearily
on when her eyes' fell on a lovely
picture of maidenhood personified,
fresh and fair, breathing the inno-
cence of a young life, the lips slightly
parted, as if to let the soft air play
upon them more freely, the eyes full
of a shadowy light, the form exqui-
.sitely rounded. "How sweet !" said
mna, and she turned to the catalogue
to see what it was. Her heart jumped
into her throat as she saw the artist's
laine; it was Greuze ! Had he not
often told her, when they were in

the little cottage together, that she
was like his pictures. " Why, it
looks like you when you first came
to our house," said Adelheide. Ina
had a tear in her eye as she passed
on. .A lady stood near one of the
pictures of the Virgin; by her side
were two little girls and a French
bonne. The lady had on a black moire
silk with a long trais that reached
nearly half across the room; a huge
coil of hair was wound around her
head; her hands'in yellow kid gloves
were hanging helplessly from her
wrists; her eyes, glowing with a
fixed vacancy, were staring at the
pictures.
"II should like to know who that
lady is with that queer expression,"
said Adelheide. "Her eyes stare
like a new-born baby's, and do not
seem to take anything in; how
strange the part in her hair looks!
She looks like a person playing queen
in a fourth-rate theatre."
Ina was 'not listening to the girls,
but now she looked up, and'saw this
same lady gazing fixedly t her.
"Miss Strahling, I thought so;
how are you?' I hardly recognized you,
you looked so ill, and I-suppose you
would scarcely know me again, but I
thought I had prepared you for the
change. I told you that I was far.
from the same person when I was
dressed- in my French dresses ; and
then I had no hair on my head when
you saw me. My husband says I
ought. not to be so regardless when
travelling, buthe'says too -the dar-
ling ! my own dear husband - that.I
am one of the few, the very few, who
can afford to neglect my appearance ;

woman he ever cares to look at at all;
my husband thinks there is some-
thing Easternin my style, but when
I am in Lee, -that is where our
lands are, and our very lovely home,
our estate,- then when there, I often
wrap :around me my lace shawl in the
true Spanish style. INlet it fall from
my head quite around my face ; then
my husband says I look Southern.
Everybody in Lee says that Mrs. Col-.
man is an exception to the rule, and
she can do just as she chooses. I
tell my beloved husband that he is
blinded by partiality for me, but it is
no wonder, Mademoiselle Str5hling.
I am not at atll like, the Americans, I
am more vivid, more startling ; there
is, as my husband says, more of the
Orient about me. I was just stand-
ing before a picture of Cleopatra, and
my bonne says, my Parisian bonne,
that it is very like me as 'I was last
wdek at the King's ball. I was really
elegant, Mademoiselle Strohling; I
had on all my peerless jewels, and
my coronet on my brow. My hus-
band is so fond of me when, he sees
me dressed, but my husband does not-
wish me to create too much of a sen-
dation. I often say to.him, 'Now, my
own darling husband, don't you be
jealous'; not that I would really
give him any cause, but my husband,
is so sensitive. I feel that a truly
noble-minded woman can have no
thought -no, none -save for her
husband and her own children; they
must necessarily absorb her entirely ;
she can have no centre, no circum-
ference, save them, -is it not true,
Miss Str5hling ?"
" I think you are right,"' said
Ina, her mind wandering far away

from Mrs. Colman to Emanuele Ber.
tani.
" I come here," said Mrs. Colman,
"to live amongst the old masters.
My husband- bought me a Murillo
when I was in Spain ; he sent it to
our beautiful estates. I used to gaze
at that picture, and I think I may
say that I grew purer and holier~
yes, purer and holier - every time I
stood before it. I think art so ele.
eating to the soul, Miss Strahling; it
increases its pristine purity; as the
Italians so beautifully express it,
' animy candidy.' How chaste their
language is !_ and their natures too, so
transparent, so limpid, if I may speak
it in their own poetical terms ! I have
a soul so set to poetry, -and 'sois
my husband's, and so are my darlings',
my only ones. You have not noticed
my treasures, Miss Strohling. I bring
them with me, to initiate their minds
early in the mystery of true inspira-
tion. They are very Greek in their
styles, Miss Strohling; they would
not have been apt to inherit an
American type from me, you know!
What a misfortune for a mother to
have nothing   Oriental about her!
My own, my husband, said that was
what first drew him to me, the Cash-
merian in me ! Was it not a beautiful
idea? so like my husband ! I was
passionately in love with him the'
moment I set my eyes on him, and
so was he with me, - passionately,-
but purely ; as I said before, every
feeling was such as the angels might
have felt. I was looking at my pre-
cious ones a moment ago, and think-
ing how much I had to be grateful
for. I was thinking how like Evan-
geline looks to the infant Saviour,

and how much Evelina resembles the
little John; do they not, Miss Stroh-
ling ? Greek types,, you know, both !
I think I never have met with more
truly refined -natures than theirs, ex-
quisitely delicate, so sensitive to the
beautiful; they perfectly understand
all these, pictures, yet my precious
Evangeline is'but four years old, and
my treasure Evelina is just three. I
think God gave them to me because
he was so pleased with me, that is
what I always say to my husband."
"Yes," said Ina, not knowing well
what she was answering to.
0," looking at her watch, "I must
go! I have already taken in such a
draught of genius that I feel it in my
very veins. I have lingered beyond
'my wonted hour. I very much fear
that my own husband will be anxious
about me, the darling ! .I cannot
wait another moment, I must run
home and kiss him; he will be quite
out of his mind if I stay another in-
stant, it might kill him. I must say
good morning, Miss Str5hling, I shall
hope to meet you again." So saying,
she walked away with the becoming
dignity which her train demanded,
and behind her at a respectful dis-
tance followed her bonne and the
two infant Greek types.
"Was that English she was talk-
ing ?" said Adelheide. "She went on
just like a mill, and never waited
for you to say a word ; what a queer
lady !" They walked on, looking at
the pictures,, until Adelheide said,
"We are tired, dear Mademoiselle;
will you take us into the garden a
little while ?"
"Yes, certainly." '
'The girls went on in front of~ Inal

She stopped a moment to look again
at the Greuze picture, when a- gen-
tleman stoped too, and stepped near
her; he spoke in French.
"Pardon, j'ai mis mon pied sur
votre robe," he said, touching his hat
to her, and looking at her intently.
She looked up, quite startled, and
said, " O, cela ne fait rien, Monsieur."
" Mais vous etes charmante, gen-
tille, et belle comme votre portrait;
etes-vous seule ?"
She colored crimson, hastily drew
down her veil, and ran after Adel-
heide and Marie, who had already
gained the other room.
" Do not leave me alone," she said,
quickly. " I was frightened, some
one spoke to me!'"
They went down the stairs, and
into the gardens. The fountains
were playing ; the trees were already
in bloom; it was lovely. The girls
were enchanted. Suddenly Ina was
aware- that some one was following
them. She looked around and saw
the same gentleman who had ad-
dressed her in the gallery. She
hastened her steps, and said in an
under voice to the girls, "'Do not
look around, we are followed ; quick- -
ly let us turn into this side path.
They hastened - in, and presently
came too a statue, and then a little
side walk, all rustic. A lady and
gentleman were sitting lower down,
on one of the stone seats; the gen-
tleman held the lady's parasol, and
was tracing something on the gravel
at her feet ; the lady's head was so
near his shoulder that she seemed
almost to be leaning on it.
" Look there !" said Adeiheide,
pointing to them. Ina raised her

eyes and recognized Emanuele Ber-
tani and Madame de Turenne'! Ca-
milla had heard the coming steps,
and had raised-her head hastily, and
turned to see who it was. She
blushed scarlet, and rose to greet
Mademoiselle Strbhling. Ina would
have given worlds to hide herself
anywhere, even under the earth, but
it was too late ; she felt that her
face had- become rigid; it hurt her
to move her lips-; her mouth seemed
as if it was locked, and she could
not open it.
" Good morning," said Madame de
Turenne. "We are both early birds.
I was wandering about alone and
met Monsieur Bertani, and he had
pity on my lonely condition and
took me this lovely walk. Is it not
sweet here ? I am in love with this
garden ! I do not know why we
Italians do not- come here oftener.
We leave all our prettiest spots to
foreigners, and  they have quite
usurped our places. It is time that
we all should join inthe Garibaldian
chorus of " Fuori d'Italia, fuori,
stranieri !"* And she imitated the
little organ-grinders' voices, who are,
perpetually singing these words.
"You too have the. good taste to'
know where to walk; out of the dust
of the city and those tiresome porti-
cos where every one is stared at by
all the idle young officers who have
nothing better to do than lounge
around the cafes from morning to
night. I am so glad we met you!"
Now this was not true at all, and
Camilla was true, but she felt so
much embarrassed before Ina th~at
she said the first thing that came
* "O t of Italy, away, stranigers." ;

into her mind. She was vexed that
" Ina had seen her head so n]ear
Emanuele; she would not have
minded another so much as Ina
but Ina always had a peculiar infi.
ence' over her. She truly admired
her, and she wanted Ina's friendship,
and esteem.
"I was sent," began Ina. "Ma.
dame Benoni wished me to take her
daughters out for a little change,
Madame Benoni thought it would do
good to her daughters to look at the
pictures ; good morning." She looked
up at Emanuele with an eye so cold,
so piercingly chilling, that his fell
before it. He bowed, and she left
the place.
"What is it," said Camilla, "about
that young girl that fills me almost
with awe ? I have never been afraid
of any one, but there is something
about Mademoiselle Strohling that
makes me feel almost timid at times,
I am always wondering whether or
no she likes me, and I want her to
like, to love me, she is so lovely
herself. But was it not very awk-
ward, Emanuele?    .Confess, man of
the world as you are, that you too
felt the embarrassment of our posi.
tion. Well, I do not care," be said,
looking up at him. "I have had a
happy morning, and no one can rob
me of that."
Hedid not answer.
" I believe you are afraid of Mad-
emoiselle Strohling, too. One thing
I am sure of, that she .will not tell
Marcello, or any one else, that she
saw us here. Do speak, Emanuele,
and tell me something."
" I can tell you nothing," he said,
"'that you do not know already1--

that I love you,"-words that you
have heard from hundreds of lips."
"Yes," she said, blushing, "but
that I have never before listened to
with pleasure."
CHAPTER XIV.
u     WE had a delightful time !"
said the young girls, as they
entered their mother's parlor with
Mademoiselle Str5hling. " The pic-
tures were so beautiful; and whom
do you think we met ?"
"I think Madame Benoni is tired,"
said Ina, hastily; "perhaps it would
be better to go to your rooms now,
and take off your bonnets."
"No," said 1 dame Benoni, "I
am not at, all tired. I may say that
this is one of the few days during
which I have felt remarkably well,
quite like a young girl! It is very
seldom that my.daughters' voices do
not fall on my nerves. To-day I may
say I feel very free from all nervous
excitement. Who was it, my dears,
that you saw ?"
"Why, just as we went to walk out
in the gardens, a gentleman followed
Mademoiselle Strohling, and we
turned into a' side path, and there'sat
Monsieur Bertani and. Madame de
Turenne close to him! They seemed
quite frightened when they saw us !
"It is just as'I thought," said Ma-
dame Benoni, smiling to herself. "I
alwys said it would be so, and when
I say a thing will be so, it always is."
"Will you permit me," said Ina,
"to withdraw to my room?"
"Certainly, my dear," and Ina

97

went to her room. Her mind would
form no other thought save that she
must go to him, that she must see
him  alone. She had been now at
Madame Benoni's four months, and
she had never seen him alone but
twice in all that time; she must
speak to him now or 'die. Her heart
felt scarce one throb of pain, it seemed
so turned to marble; only every time
she breathed it went into a gasp.
But how could she get an excuse to
go out alone ? No young girl in Italy
is allowed to walk alone, and although
Ina's position as a governess made it
very different for her, yet she was so
young and so attractive in her ap-
pearance that Madame Benoni had
made that one of the points of the
contract when Ina first came to her.
Sometimes she went, though very
rarely alone, with the demoiselles
Benoni; but what could she do with
them whilst she was at Bertani's, -
and Adeiheide's unfortunate speech
that a young man had followed Ina,
she feared, would make the difficulties
more insuperable than ever. Dinner-
time came, and she was ever saying
to herself, "How shall I see him ?
how shall I get to him ?" She saw
Marcello looking anxiously at her ;
she averted her face to avoid his
eye. Suddenly she thought, " He
could help me," and then she shrank
again from the thought of confiding
any part of her secret to him; he
would imagine something, and that
must not be. The evening came and
brought not Bertani. Madame Be-
noni remarked his absence with a
smile. Ina embroidered all the even-
ing without once raising her -eyes ;
nervously her hands flew over the~

canvas; she never once spoke. At
last, just as Madame Benoni was go-
ing to retire for the night, with burn-
ing face and hands as cold as marble
she -said, " Madame Benoni, may I,
might I, have the' coach- to go and
see a friend to-morrow, a German
lady, who has just arrived ?" It was
true that Ina had a friend in town,'
but she was too utterly wretched at
heart to think of visiting any one.
Two years ago, Ina would have
thought it terrible to tell anything
that was not strictly true, but now
all was changed. "I have gone,"
she said to herself, "from one eva-
sion to another until there is no
more truth in me ! I am fast becom-
ing as she is; she said she was glad
to see me this morning, when she
wished me miles away!"
"Certainly, my dear, you can have
it at any hour; it would be unjust to
refuse it to you, since it is the first
time you have ever asked it for your-
self since you came to the house !"
"I feel grateful to you," said Ina,
earnestly.
That night she passed much as she
had the last ; once or twice, in her.
utter exhaustion, she threw herself
on the bed and closed her eyes,
and suddenly the blood would rush
up to her brow, her heart would beat
so that she would spring from the,
bed and begin again her weary
pacing up and down. "I am so
tired of suffering," she would say,
"and to think that it must ever be
thus ! no change, ever this agony of
heart ! Ormy God.!" .
The dull day broke again on Tna.
It was a comfort to see its dawn ; slhe
should see rhim; ,not that that was

anything of joy to her now, but it
would be a comfort for once to un.
chain her heart, to tell him all her
scorn and bitterness of soul. The car.
riage was ordered at twelve, and lha
after dressing herself carefully, so as,
to avoid all observation from Madame
Benoni, left the house ; she drove to
a street near his apartment, and then
she got out and turned the corner
telling John to wait for her until she
came. What if, after all, Emanuele
should not be in!   She mounted the
few  stairs that led to his residence,
she saw his name written on the
brass plate, she rang the bell; a young
man-waiter came to the door. Ina
could not speak, she made a sign and
passed in; the man opened the door
of his master's sitting-room, and then
shut the door.    Ma' sat down; she
could ' scarcely breathe. She looked
unconsciously around ; everything in
the room was in perfect taste, there
was an air of bachelor luxury about
it which must have struck any one
Embroidered cushions, embroidered
cigar-cases beautifully mounted, em-,
broidered letter-receivers and port.
folios, showed that fair hands had
been busied for him. A portrait of
himself -hung above the sofa, the
breast covered with decorations; it
was a gift of homage from some young
artist.  The table was covered with
books, cigar-holders, etc., and therein'
the' midst of all, was an exquisite
miniature standing, - yes, it was Ca.
milla's. There stood her rival before
her face in glowing colors; her cheek'
was not paled by neglect and be.
trayal;, she was newly, freshly happy,
Ina envied her with a great pang of
jealousy that she thought she had

crushed quite down; now it rankled
there anew. She took the picture in
her hand and looked closely at it.
As she sat thus; the door opened and
Monsieur Bertani came in. He - did
not see who it was at once, for her{
head was bent and her veil had fallen
over her face.  Hearing   the  door
close, she looked up.  Bertani started
slightly, and became a shade paler
than he was.
"Ina," he  said, "why    are you
here?"
She rose and stood proudly before
him.
"I am here," she said, " because I
am your wife, because your home is
my home, and my rights, are here.
I have come to claim those rights.
I have come to claim my title as
your lawful wife, and I stir not from
here until it is accorded'to me. Give
me your name for your boy's sake ;
for my own I care not. You must
stand now openly before the world,
what you are, no more concealments.
So long as I thought it for your
good and for your country's, in my
weakness, for love of you, I was
silent; now all is past.  I, have seen'
you look at another as no married
man has a right to do ; but you are
free, free to find what love you may,
only it shall be openly as my de-
clared husband, not hidden under a
false life. Go forth in your colors as
you are, but do not hide them like a
coward, and win in the open field
what victories you can!  I gave you
my promise of secrecy once. I take
back that promise; it was an unholy
one. 'Before all the world I will say
you are my husband ! your name is
mine, Emanuele Bertani!"

"You cannot bear my name, Ina,"
he said slowly, and looking her fix-
edly in the face.
"Because it has fallen so low ?"
she said scornfully. " I will yet
stoop to pick it up, for my son's
sake."
No, Ina, because it is not yours
to bear, nor yet your son's."
"It is a lie," she said, growing
scarlet, - " a wicked lie !"
He caught her by the arm. "It is
no lie," he said calmly; "listen. I
went to Switzerland, - Lucerne, -
and married you, if you remember
rightly, fifteen months ago ; it was in
the Protestant church, by a Protes-
tant clergyman, that the ceremony
was performed. - I am a Catholic by
birth and baptism, you are a Protes-
tant ; a marriage thus made is null
and void, it has no legal right save
when confirmed by the Pope, the
King, or the Consul. This confirma-
tion has never taken place. I am
not your husband, you are not my
wife,; no court of justice can make
you so."
"Say that again," said Ina, looking
blankly at him, - " say that again."
" I have said that you are not my
wife, our marriage was illegal; to be
man and wife, we should have to
be married again, as much 'as-if such
a ceremony never had been per-
formed before. I swear it you, on
my honor, that what I say is true."
"You hold yourself then free ?"
she said, glaring at him. fiercely.
Emanuele quailed before that look;
It was no longer Ina's face he saw,
before him - that sweet, still face ;
now, every passion chasing itself
across it, it was wild, and fierce;


INA.

it was like nature on a summer's
day, when gll is calm and silent, and
suddenly the tempest sweeps over it
rendering all one mad commotion
of the elements. Emanuele folded
his arms before Ina and stood look-
ing at her.
"Do you mean that you are free,
that you hold me as a cast-off mis-
tress, of whose monotonous charms
you are weary, and your son as your
bastard ? Do you mean that you
meant to deceive me even from the
fist ? " she said, her voice suddenly
changing from its sharp harshness
to a low moan. "0 God, I do not
see clearly," putting her hands over
her eyes; then, rushing up to him,
she caught hold of his arm, and said,
wildly : " Tell me that you are de-
ceiving ine now, and I will forgive
all your jest. I will pardon all this
agony of pain you have caused me.
I will fall on my knees before you,
and love .you still, and pray for you,
and bless you, and die for you, if you
do not love me, and leave yon free !
Tell me that, speak, clear yourself !
0 God, no word ! , Say, 'Ina, I love
another. I loved you once, but that
is over now. I cannot enslave my
heart. I an your husband, but my
heart is free; that was another's be-
fore I was myself aware of it.' 0
speak!" She almost screamed.
Emanuele stood silent before her;
what could he say?
"Then you never loved me," she
said, " no, not even from the first,"-
as if speaking to herself, -"all those
sweet hours were false ; he waskmock-'
ing me; he was taking my heart in
his hands, and pulling it to bits, as
he would the leaves of a flower, until

the chalice was bare ; b t what care
I I for the .past ? he mus answer to
me now for the future. Ah nono
fiend could commit such a deed! I
I was so innocent, so young and trust.
ing. I loved him   so. I gave him
all!"
"Ina," he said, "you are not my
wife, but yet -"
She .drew herself up before him,
and said slowly : "I am your wife,
Emanuele Bertani! I am your wife,
- before God I am, yes, and before
man too, when he knows your treach-
ery ; nor God nor man will give you
your freedom, only my death can
make you free; you know it, and
beware how you take one step to-
wards that freedom. I care not save
for my child, our child. Ah, what a
curse that sounds to me now! Tell
me that you hold yourself bound to
me."
"I cannot do that, Ina, for, as I
told you, I am free."
" 0 God !" she said, in utter de-
spair ; then she went up to him and,
looking him imploringly in the face,
said, " Emanuele, I have no promise
to you now which- binds me, but
promise me that you will hold your-
self bound to me, and I promise you
that I will never see you'more, that
I will still keep your secret, as I
have kept it up to this time, - it is
the only grace I ask of you;-if not, I
will proclaim openly to all the world
your shame. This is the last sacrifice
I can make for my child !"
" You have my word," he said;
unow leave me"
Ina paused, and gave him one last
look ; all the. love of the past and
present hatred seemed to struggle in

that long, fixed gaze. "I loved you
once," she said ; and she turned and
glided out of the room.
Ina was going to leave Madame
Benoni's, but she had not yet spoken
to her. She had not yet revealed to
Marcello her decision to leave them.
She did not any longer know her-
self; she seemed to herself turned to
stone, she felt no sensation any
more, she was stunned and be-
numbed. She often used to say to
herself, "My blood has ceased to run
in my veins. I am    all cold and
hard. I feel nothing,.no sense of
life,"-and this was the most dread-
ful sensation of all. "He called me
Pygmalion's statue once, but that was
marble turning to flesh. But I am
flesh turning back to marble. My
limbs are so heavy that it hurts me
to lift them, and I -cannot think at
all. I believe my memory is going.
I cannot"remember when I went to
him, yetI did go !"  A week passed
thus, and Bertani never visited the
Benonis again. Ina lingered, too,
around the spot, with a feeling that
if she were there she could ward off
some strange evil that was to come,
--it did not take a definite shape,
--but some last terrible blow that
was reserved for her by the hand
of destiny. Ina had not seen Ma-
dame de Turenne since that morn-
ing she had met her at the public
gardens. Where was she ? What
was she doing now ? - There was
to be a great bal costume  et 'rnasqu,
given by  the   Comtesse   Jdrome.
She was a very wealthy and fash-
ionable woman who had come to
Turin to pass the winter after hav-
ing grown weary of the cream of

Parisian . life ; she thought it was
well to choose a new -field for her
charms, and she had decided to daz-
zle Turin with her splendor,-Turin,
the capital and court of Italy. She
and Madame de Turenne had been
the reigning and rival belles all
winter. The Benonis -had received
cards for, the ball* and so had Ina,
for Madame Jerome had seen Ina
the night that she was at the opera
with  Madame    de Turenne, had
looked at her for a long .time with
her lorgnon, and had declared, in
spite of her being in Madame Be-
noni's .house in the capacity of a
governess, that she.was "bien gentille,
vraiment charmante, et qu'elle avait
l'air noble !" Madame Benoni, of
course, was not going, and naturally
Ina had not been consulted as to
whether she would go or no. She
and, Madame Benoni were sitting in
her boudoir when the door was
thrown open and Madame de Tu-
renne was announced.. There was
no escape now for Ina. Ina looked
at her ; she was charming. No
change had come over her beauty;
she looked more brilliant than ever.
"0, how glad I am to see you!"
said Madame de Turenne. "It is
such ages since I have been here,
and yet there is not a day that I
have not thought of you. Why have
you not been to see me, Mademoi-
selle Ina ? I heard that you were
out in the coach, quite alone, the
other day. I was really hurt that it
was not to see me."
* Ina said, quietly, that she had
gone out to see -a friend from her
own country.
" Indeed," said Madame die Tu-

with sabres as usual, and at the first
scratch that drew blood they shook
hands and retired from, the field.
Still, such things are far from agree-
able. Nina is very conscientious, and
she felt it deeply. I think duelling
such a miserable custom in our coun-
try, and it springs, I believe, from
the root of all evil here, -idleness.
Marcello says they are not so terrible
as those in America, where they fight
with pistols at ten paces. But those
are duels to some purpose. Here, if
a man treads on. another's foot, or
looks at the lady he loves, or brushes
the one on his arm accidentally as
he passes, there must immediately
be satisfaction demanded for his
wounded honor."
"Where is Marcello ?" said Ma-
dame Benoni. " I have not seen him
to-day?" .
"I do not know," said Ina, looking
vacantly at Madame de Turenne,
"Why," said Camilla, laughing,
"were you afraid -he had gone to
fight a duel ? There is no danger of
that. Marcello is invincible ; he has a
sang-froid that nothing can move,
and a temper so good that no one
can anger him; is it not so, Madem-
oiselle Ina?"
"I believe so," said poor Ina. She
wished so much that Madame de1
Turenne would go, and leave her in
peace. There she stood so calm, and
she felt every moment as if she must
turn and tell her how she hated her !
She looked at her lips, and wondered
if they had ever felt the pressure of
Emanuele's upon them. Ah, why
could she not drop dead at her rival's
feet, and sleep forever, and forget ?
"Good morning," said Madame de t

Turenne. "I will come and tell you
all about the evening, if you wish it."
" Is Monsieur Bertani to be there ?"
said Madame Benoni. " He has quite
abandoned us ; but that is the way
with friends, you know !"
Madame de Turenne blushed -
how dared she in Ina's presence ?-
and said, "Yes, he told me that he
-should most certainly go."
" You are turning his head, my
dear," said Madame Benoni.
"A statesman's head is too firmly,
put on," she said, laughing. "I think
it would be better worth while to
turn his heart if one could, but I
have begun to doubt whether that is
an article in the possession of anyi
man."
"Well, my dear, I must confess
that that is a strange argument for
you to make use of."
"Indeed," she said, with a slight'
petulance in her tone, like a spoiled
child that has been thwarted for
the first time, "I believe what I
say is true ; men say a great many
things which create feeling in women,
but I doubt if it does not all end in
smoke with them, when the fire has
already burnt into the victim of their
vanity."
" You are severe in your judgment
this morning."
"I am   cross and out of humor.
Farewell!" and she left the-room.
That night, vhen Ina went to bed, a
sudden thought flashed over her, that
she too must go to this ball. There,hid-
den under her mask, she could stand
apart, and watch Madame de Turenne
and Emanuele. The more she thought.
of it, the more determined she felt
,hat she must go, how she knew not;

but this idea had taken possession
of her"mind, and she lay awake all
night, her cheeks burning with the
fever that was on her, revolving some
possible plan to escape from the
house on the evening of the ball.
She knew now what Madame de. Tu-
renne's dress would be, but that mat-
tered not, ,she would have known
her, however masked ! She must go,.
she would stand near her, she would
watch his face when he did not
know that her eye was upon him,
she would snatch from him the very
secret of his soul when he dreamed
not that she was near. During the
next few days that elapsed she had
no rest from this thought ; she would
see them once more together when
they knew not that her eye rested
upon them! then she would go to
" her boy, and hide herself with him for-
ever in her misery. She would pray
God day and night to take them both
away from this world Of sorrow. Per-
haps he would listen to her prayer,
she was so young to have suffered so
much, and she had never willingly
done any wrong; and then the baby
was so innocent, 'how could shame
and grief be visited upon him ! That
would make God unjust, and he was
ever our Heavenly Father ; he would
not refuse them that last mercy.
Rest, rest," said Ina, leaning her head
against her hand, "that is all I ask
now ; but could I rest if I could not
forget? 0, does God not mean, when
we go into another world, to give us
oblivion of our past ? and how can we
preserve our identity, and yet erase
all that has wrung our souls on
earth ? No, I must cease to re-
memnber who I have been, and yet

have my boy in my arms; feeling
only his love, and knowing, not
whence he came, I may still be my.
self; that will not be annihilation. I
can be as I was when a young gi,
with my mother's spirit, and my fa-
ther and Wilhelm, Soil and my
boy ; then Sofi and I will call him
our child, and he will have two
mothers, and we will love him so
that he will forget to ask for his
father."
The day came of the grand soire
and Ina passed it in nervous restless-
ness. She could not fix her mind far
a moment on anything, she started
if any one spoke to her, she trembled
if she heard a voice. 1Warcello per-
ceived it; nothing that concerned
Ina ever went unnoticed by him. At
eight o'clock -in the evening she'
called the servant Katerina, Ma-
dame Benoni's especial' maid, to her,
and said: "Katerina, do not go to
bed to-night at the usual hour ; wait
until I come for you, it may be very
late; try and get all the servants to.
retire at an earlier hour, if possible,
than is customary., I am going to
ask a great favor of you, but I have
known you always so good and true
to your mistress, that I am sure you
will not fail he ; and remember that
you repeat not one word that I have
told you."
"I have lived here twelve years,
Mademoiselle, and you may trust
me as you would your mother; call
me when you are ready for me."
na sat with Madame Benomn un-
til ten o'clock. 0, how terribly tong
the minutes seemed ! She listened
acutely to the ticking of the clock,
the time would not pass; then she

went to her room, and sat with her
watch in her hand until eleven; then
she rose hastily and blew out her
candles, then went stealthily to the
door, and, opening it slightly, lis-
tened breathlessly to the sounds in
the house. All was silent, save that
she could hear a tread, from time to
tine, in Marcello's room; a gleam of
light shone from under his door. At
last he opened it so suddenly that Ina
had but just time to draw back be-
fore he passed her room; she could
see by the light that streamed from
his chamber that he was in full dress.
He paused a moment when he came
to where she was. Ina's heart beat
so loud, she was afraid he had heard
it; then he passed by, and she heard
him open the door and go down
stairs. It was eleven o'clock. She
stole out of her room, along the
entry, past 'Madame Benoni's, to
Katerina's room.
"Come," she said, in a trembling
whisper, "come quickly !" Katerina
followed Ina. Ina shut her door noise-
lessly, and then, taking hold of Ka-
teeina's arm, said: "Katerina, you
must trust me. I would not do a
wrong thing, but you are the only
person in the world who can render
me a service. I must go to the ball
to-night. I must go unknown to any
one. You will have to go out qui-
etly and get me a carriage, just on
the place; they are always there at all.
hours. I will dress in the mean time ;
I need no help. Then you must wait
up for me until one o'clock ; I may
he a little later. You must not go to
sleep for one moinent, but stand
watching from my window until I I
come, and then open the door for me.

Here," she said, putting a fifty-franc
piece into her hand, "this is not to
bribe you, Katerina, but I cannot bear
to ask a service that I may not re-
pay."
"Believe me, Mademoiselle, it is
not for your money, but because I
love you, that I would be willing to
do anything for you!1"
"Then go, Katerina, quick, for
God's sake !"
Katerina went silently out of the
room, along the entry, and Ina heard
her too shut the door and turn the
key ; then she began to dress herself
with trembling hands. She put on
her white silk that she had worn at
Madame de Turenne's. Nobody would
know it, for it was plain. She took
out a white bournous that her brother
had brought her from Constantinople,
and which she had never worn, - it
was made of white camel's hair, and
fell gracefully in ample folds all
around her,   and a white satin mask,
that she had bought the last winter,
but had never worn. She was all
rehdy just as she heard Katernia en-
ter the door again.
" The carriage is there, Mademoi-
selle ; you look like a beautiful
spirit."                             -
Ina drew the hood up over her
head, so that it covered all her hair,
even low down on the brow, took her
white glovs in her hand, and then
said hastily, "0, my ticket'! my head
turns ; if I had forgotten that !" The
large 'card invitation, requesting all
those who were invited to present-it
at the door, was soon found, and Ina
glided out of her room, down stairs,
into the carriage which was awaiting
hier.

"Take me to 47 Rue Ctvour," said
Ina, "where the Countess Jdrome
gives her great costume ball to-night,'
and the coachman drove off. Ina
took up the card and unconsciously
her eye fell on it; she saw now in
large letters, by the light of the
coachman's candle, that no lady would
be admitted without a cavalier; the
blood eddied to her head so that she
could not think, but she knew only
one thing, that go she -would now at
all hazards. The carriage went so
fast that she feared to arrive before
she could collect her mind. It
stopped. Shrieks of " Take care !"
"Don't run me down!1" "]Back
there !" met her ear. She looked-
out; there were crowds of people
collected thronging the- street, to see
what little they could of the show.
Ina was terrified. The coachman
opened the door.
"Here we are, Madame; it is a
pity you 're alone."
" Tell me where you will be,'I
said Ina, "precisely at a quarter to
one. I will give you fifty francs for
your fee if you will be there punctu-
ally, and not keep me waiting a sec-
ond."
The man's face was illuminated at
the thought of such a night's good
fortune ; all made, too, in less than
a couple of hours.
"Look opposite, just down at that
corner, Madame ; there may be- a
crush here, so you just cross the street
a little lower down, where that apoth-
ecary's sign is, and I will be there,
with a white piece of paper stuck in
my hat, so you will know me the
monient you see me !" --
" Yes," 'said Ina, " and you look

for me too ; remember I am all in
white."
He touched his hat, and drove off.
tIna passed swiftly through the press
of people.   " She 's the only one
who    is  alon,"  some  one  said.
" Why, she can't get in; what is she
alone for ?" said another. "Hush,"
said another, "perhaps it is a man in
disguise, and he may give you a
knock for your insolence!"     "Ha,
ha, ha!, " laughed two or three, "a
man, and walk so graceful as that;
ten to one, I'llb et it 's a woman!"
"Let's see, let 's see," shouted a third.
Ina was so terrified that she
thought. she should fall; and, fall
amongst that crowd, what would be-
come of her ?   But some one said,
"Here 's the gendarme, take care
what you do !"    And she hurried
on ; now she was in the portico, she
stopped a second to lean against it;
then on she went up the marble
stairs, amongst livery servants who
stared at her. The stairs were lined
on each side with flowers that gave
out a delicious fragrance ; the lights
were hidden amongst them, so that
it seemed as if they themselves
sprang from the flowers. On she
passed up to the top, where stood a
man looking like an official, with a
gilt order around his neck. There
were several persons standing near
him; some had just shown their
cards. Ina handed him hers, but he
said, "Pardon me, Madame, your'
card is good, but no lady can pass
in alone."
"My husband just ran back," she
said, "to get my bracelet, which I
dropped in the coach. I feel ill;
please let me step in."

" Certainly," he said, and bowed to
her to enter.
She was shown to the dressing-
room. When she left it she saw
several fashionable young men stand-
ing in a group; one of them.she rec-
ognized* as having been at Madame
de Turenne's the day of the dinner.
It was Monsieur lufarchini.   His
name was F4ddric, and she had heard
Madame de Turenne     say, as she
passed him that day, "Fede, don't
look so down-hearted. I will flirt
with you by and by." He moved
aside now, and looked at her. She
went up to him, and, slipping her,
arm in his, changing her voice to
that falsetto key which is used at all
mask-balls, she said, " Fede, do you
not know me?"
"I only know that your figure is
the personification of grace ; if your
face is half so lovely, I am your
sworn knight for life."
"Hush," she said, "you forget your
Cleopatra. Have you so soon for-
sworn yourself ? You have made
me mad with jealousy for a year,
now it is time that I should revenge
myself. Promise me, at least, that
to-night you will stay by me for one
hour, and then you* will pique her
by letting her see you with another
woman. And," with a deep-drawn
sigh, "you will make me happy for a
short time." .
He pressed her arm to his breast,
and said, " I would make you happy
for always if it were in my power.
I think I know who you are already ;
you cannot deceive me. Are you
then," lowering his voice, "so un-
happy at home as they say you are ?
* gentlemenn in Italy seldom wear masks.

Poor lady ! with your beauty, to be
so treated by a brute!"
"Yes, I am very wretched," said
Ina. She knew she must keep up
her character, for she could not be
left alone ; but her head was whirl-
ing around; all the blood seemed to
have rushed there, and the voices
of the people sounded like a suc-
cession of shrieks in her ears.
" Come this way," she said; " this is
the way !"  She tutoydd him, as is
the custom when under a mask. "I
want to find my happy rival."
"No,leave her to her conquests,
and leave me to my new-found
appiness."
" No, I must see her."
"Could you recognize her ?"
"Yes, by instinct."
The music clashed out, and above
it rose the din of high voices. Near
Ina stood a lady dressed as Night;
her costume was literally sown with
diamonds, which glittered under. the
black lace like stars. Ina turned
sick at the words she heard a hand-
some young officer address to her ;
she wondered if they stirred' her
soul, as once her own was moved by
the words of him who had so falsely
betrayed her. They stopped a mo-
ment to look at the dancing; the
whole room seemed a mad whirl of
colors; like the bright gleams in the
kaleidoscope, they formed and part-
ed, met and separated again, ever in
new figures.
A" I have followed you for two
months," he said in low tones, "with
the hope of seeing you one instant
alone. I know you under your veil,
as the bird recognizes its particular
branch although hidden under the

forest leaves. I dare all for you'
sake, and you have not vouchsafed
me one look."
" I dared not," said the lady, ina
tremulous voice. "I am never alone
his sister watches me constantly, my
husband is terribly jealous."
"And I am madly so! I love you
and have the first right over- you;
do not tremble; tell me if, you will
meet m  at -" Ina did not hear
where--" to-morrow?"
"Yes," said the lady, in a low
voice. " I have no longer a will of
my own."
" I know -you, I know you," shout-
ed a gentleman; "even the darkness
of night cannot conceal you from
me;i thus shrouded, you are as be-
witching as everi"
" Are you weary ?" said Monsieur
Marchini to Ina.,. " Lean upon my
arm more heavily. I do not even
feel you; it is sweet to have that
little hand fluttering so near my
heart."
" Will you allow me your partner
for a turn, Marchini ? "
"She does not dance, and, if she
did, I would not part with her."
" Marchini is always very exclu-
sive," said another, laughing; "he
chooses well."
"Yes, he has good taste. I dare say
that 's the ballerina that he has been
courting all winter that he has got
under his arm ; he said she did not
dance to put us off the scent ; he has
kept her shut up close for months,
so that a fellow could not get a peep
.at her when off the stage ; you '1l see
that when unmasking time comes
she ,will suddenly disappear. I
caught a glimpse of her foot ; it is as

r small as those flowers they call ladies'.
d slippers ; let us keep close to them,
and see where they will go."
a " No, no, I do not want to get into
trouble- with Marchini; he 's a fiery
fellow, and there is no telling what
he might do. I amn going after that
little imp inred."
;   Two pilgrims passed, in long white
l dresses, with red crosses. on their
breasts.
" Where are you bound, gentle
pilgrims ? to Holy Land ? Do not go
-so far; you will find knights enough
whose wounds you can heal without
wandering   away   from   your own
country."
"Do not answer him," whispered
one to the other; "he will find us
out." They put their fingers to their
lips, in sign that they could not
speak.
"Bound by a vow of silence ? My
lady must speak to me. Bon voyage,
fair pilgrims     -
" 0, I shall die ! " whispered one to
the other. " Here comes my husband;
if he should find me out, he would
kill me ; if he speaks to us, do not
say one word. 0, why have we not
met Henri before this ?" The gentle-
man whom the lady so feared came
nearer and nearer; she shrank behind
her companion, he looked at them
a moment, stopped as if he were go-,
ing to speak, and then, apparently
having changed his mind, passed by.
"0, you do not think he did it on
purpose ; 'you are sure he suspected
nothing !"
"What a crowd ! " said M~iarchini,
"but it has the advantage of pressing
you, nearer to me. I wish it were
even greater than it is ; you tremble"'

and they passed on. Now and then
they had to stop again, because there
was such a pressure of people. A
lady brushed lightly by on the arm
of 4 gentleman;' she was dressed as a
snow-storm; her dress was made of
folds upon folds of the softest illusion
lace, all tufted .with little flakes of
wool; a veil of the same fell from her
head to her feet; around her dark
hair, which fell down on her shoul-
ders, was a wreath of crystals made
like icicles, and sprays of the same
looped her dress..
Marchini bowed to his friend, and
said, en passant, " You have chosen a
cold companion."
"Better," said the other, laughing,
"to have her melt in my arms, than
to own a spirit who will vanish with
the morning light."
Just behind was a lady in a dress
made of many    irts of velvet, one t
tunic over another, and  gradually
letting their different .tints vanish
one into the other ; the bottom skirt
was black, that was folded    with.
scarlet, and that with amber-colored
yellow; a little flame of light jetted
out from her forehead, and its con- r
tainer was so skilfully covered with
her hair that you knew not whence 1
it came ;' she had a stuffed swallow  r
on her breast, and she was fire. Be- I
hind her, on the arm of him she was I
luring by her charms to the kingdom s
of love and torments and sin, was a s
beautifully formed woman ; she wasin
dressed in red velvet pointed at the,
bottom, with" 'a black velvet over- i
dress 'pointed also ; her hair was tied a
with a little red bow, and two coral y
horps were upon her brow.p
Then came Semiramide, magnifi-

cently dressed in an Eastern cos-
tume; she had on a gorgeous yellow
'satin embroidered deep with gold
in Egyptian hieroglyphs, a blue vel-
vet peplum,- with the same golden
figures on it, an Egyptian crown
of plain gold, and large African
gold hoopsin her ears, with chains
of Oriental pearls hanging from her
throat.
"If we were near Nino's tomb,"
said a gentleman who had stepped
around on the other side of her, "I
could reveal a .secret to your lover
that would make him doubt his hap-
piness."
"Speak it out here !" said the lady,
laughing. He whispered in her ear;
she uttered a low scream, and put
out her hand as if for mercy. The
gentleman on whose arm she was
said angrily, "You shall answer this
to-morrow, Barbino."
"To-night, if you will," he an-
swered.
The gentleman stepped aside a mo-
ment, and whispered with the other.
'At eight then." They bowed stiffly,
and he went back and offered Semi-
'amide his arm.
"For God's sake," Ina heard the
ady say, in low, agitated tones, "for
ny sake, if you love me,"-he drew
her quickly' away.   Marchini felt
his arm suddenly grasped convul-
ively; they were passing through a
mall room, which was a mere con-
iection, as it were, of the others; there
were two'largemarble pillars wreathed
n flowers which formed a sort of
,rch at the top; through these again
~ou could see into a long vista of
parlors beyond.
" Go and get me some cologne,"

said Ina, " I feel faint; you will find
me leaning against this pillar."
She had caught sight of Bertani,
and by his . side was Madame de
Turenne ; they were just hidden
slightly by the other pillar. Marchini
left her, after tenderly pressing her
hand, and she was alone, so near
them; they were utterly unconscious
of the presence of any one, so ear-
nestly were they talking. Ina would
have recognized Madame de Turenne
by her form in any place, but she
had on the very dress with which
she was going to deceive all the
world, and which she had described
at Madame Benoni's; it was cut to,
show her beautiful bust to the best
advantage, her arms and neck were
very bare, and magnificent jewels
sparkled on them.
"I think you the most beau-
tiful woman I ever saw," he said,
glancing at her with those dark
eyes whose expression Ina knew so
well.
"0, do not speak to me so light-
ly !" she said, in an entreating tone
of voice, and she placed her beautiful
hand on his arm; he drew it in his,
and, pressed his lips to it. Ina saw
the blood mantle in her neck behind
up to her throat, from where she
stood.
" Cupid lies in the dimples of your
hand," he said, " as Cardinal Retz
used to say he did in the wrinkles
of Ninon de l'Enclos's face ; he has
transferred his dwelling to enviable
places!"  ,
" I do not care for such empty
words," she said, letting her hand
'still lie in his.
" I love you," he said passionately,

and, stooping, kissed her ivory shoul.
der.
"You have said that to me many
times, before," she  said  earnestly,
" but I do not know what it means.
I am free ; if you truly loved me, you,
would ask me to be your wife. Do
you not love me enough for that?"
she said,'with her voice all tremulous,
"I am tired of the world, tired of
empty admiration, tired of the whole
of this weary stage of fashion and
worldliness, where one must ever act
a part one does not feel ! Since I first
spoke with you, a new life has opened
before me, and I know also, too late,
that I never knew    what love was
before. Will you not let me be your
wife? I would go with you in obscu.
rity anywhere,-in poverty, if you
wished it ; if not, all my fortune is at
your feet. Do not despise me, do not
scorn so much love. I have never
stooped before to humble myself; let
me not fall too low, let me be your
wife."
"I love you," he repeated tenderly,
passionately, "all that a man can
love."
" And shall I be your wife ?"she
said again.-
"Yes, my wife, all, all mine, Ca.
milla ; you have my faith."
They heard a low cry ; they turned
quickly, but no one was near.
"That was terrible," said Madame
de Turenne ; "it really makes me feel
nervous, as Madame Benoni would
say. Take. me away," she said, look-
ing around uneasily.
~He drew her arm in his, and they
passed into another 'parlor.
Ina fled she knew not where, On
and on through the different suites of

apartments. A gentleman noticed her;
he turned, looked, turned again and
followed her; she found her way, how

she knew not, into the entry. " Masks
off!" shouted an official. It was just
striking one o'clock ; but Ina flew by
him down stairs, through the people
that were in the street, -across the
street. A coachman made a sign to
her; she had just reached the coach,
when suddenly she put out her hand,
as if feeling for something, and fell
down senseless on the pavement. A
gentleman was behind her ; he darted
forward, and bent over her ; he lifted
her tenderly in his arms and into
the carriage.  "Quickly," he said,
"to Piazza Emanuele Filiberto !"
"But the lady promised me fifty
francs for this evening."
"Quick, and I  ill give you a hun-
dred," said Marcello, putting his
hand in his pocket, and handing the
man a bill. They were soon at his
door. He lifted Ina out as if she
had been a feather in his- arms.
There she lay lifeless. He looked
up at the window; there was a light,E
and Katerina was looking out; he
put his hand to his lips and made a
sign to her ; she hurried to the door.
He carried Ina up stairs, three long
flights, without once stopping for
breath, and, entering her room, laid
her on her bed. "Open the window;r
give me some water, some salts ;r
for God's sake, do not make any r
sound ! Ina, my beloved Ina, look I
.up! 0 God, she does not breathe ! 1
Ina, Ina," he said, beating her hands. h
She gave a great sigh, and then a t
gasp. " Ina, sweet Ina, look up; i
open your eyes - once -once, -L
speak, dearest !"                   i

INA.                        111

" Oh!" she said, looking around,
"two wives ! Who said that he dould
have two wives? I do not think
that that can be. And what becomes,
then, of the little child ? That must
die ; but no one dies, they only live
to suffer. How many wives can a
man have?" she said, looking up
pitifully in Marcello's face.
" O Ina," he said, "you are here,
at home ; do not talk so. I am al-
most wild with grief myself; re-
member, dearest, that you are here
where everybody loves you."
" Love," she said, still looking va-
cantly into his face, -" is there such
a thing as love ? why do men talk
of it ? He said he loved ; does
that mean    anything ?  They   say
God loves us when he gives us
life, but you do not think so, - do
you ?"
" You must not talk, Ina, or I
shall have to go and leave you all
alone; you are not well, and you-
must rest."
"No, do not leave me," she said,
stretching out her arms to him; "do
not go !"
" Then you must promise me to
shut .your eyes, and be perfectly
quiet."
" I will," she said.
Marcello remained by her side all
night. She was very still, only every
now and then he would hear her mur-
mur, " Two wives." At seven o'clock
he spoke to Katerina. "Undress your
ady, fold away all her clothes, put
ecr in bed, and, when it is breakfast-
ime, then go to my mother, and tell
ter that Mademoiselle Str~hling is
ll, and the doctor must be sent for .
immediately."

room dress for his morning 'costume,
and then sat down to listen to the
first stirring from his .mother's room.
He heard Katerina at last go to
his mother's chamber ; he heard an
impatient exclamation from her, -
she alone had the'monopoly of ill
health in that house, -then a loud
ringing of the bells, and John was
sent for the doctor. He felt relieved
when he had heard the order given.
He longed to go to Ina's room, and
dared not; and he passed the morn-
ing pacing to and fro in his. At
last the doctor ame; he was a long
time in Ina's room, and, when he
dame out, Marcello was waiting at
the front door for him. He put on
his hat and accompanied the doctor
down the street.
"What do you think of your pa-
tienit, Doctor ?"
"I, do not quite understand the
case," said the Doctor, seriously. "I
could account for it if Mademoiselle
Str5lyling had been subjected to
some sudden news, some great sor-
row ; but your mother says that
nothing has occurred at all, and that
she went to bed as usual perfect-
ly quiet last evening.  I find ,con-
gestion of the brain, and some dif-
ficulty from the blood having rushed
too suddenly to the heart. She is
an inttere ting-looking creature. I
should be grieved if it was a serious
thing."
"Doctor;' said Marcello, " Mad-
emoiselle Str'6hling has been sub-
jected to some terrible, as well as

sudden grief, and for a long time. -Ij
think her peace of mind has been
undermined by some great sorrow."
"Hum!" paid the Doctor, "do you
think there iis any means by which
quiet and peace could be restored to
her ?"
Marcello was silent for a moment,
and then said, " I fear not. I do not
know at all precisely what her troub.
les are, but I am   sure they are of
no common kind.      She has great
strength of character and remarka..
ble courage, and she would not sink
under anything that was easy to
bear !"
" I will consider it well," said the
Doctor, "and will call around this
evening. Just now      she must be
kept very still, she has a great deal
of fever."
"Good morning," said Marcello;
"you will be sure and call again this
evening !"
Marcello went home to wait and
hope and fear. Towards the end of
the" day he could stand it no longer;
he crept to the door on tiptoe,
so that his mother should not hear
him, and asked Katerina if he might
go in.  She nodded her head, and he
walked silently to the bed. There
Ina lay, white as the, sheet that
covered her. Her eyes were closed,
and it seemed almost to him, at first,
- that she did not breathe. He bent
down his head to her lips, and felt
the slightest motion of her heart.
He took her hand;. it lay listlessly
extended, it was so lifeless, in his;
but it was warm! He stood thus,

The next day Madame de Turenne
was announced.
"Will you see her up here, my
dear?"
"Yes," said Ina.
She was shown up stairs. She was
radiant, dressed with the most ex-
quisite taste, fresh with happiness ;
and, softened by the new sentiment
of love, she looked a vision of love-
liness. She started when she saw
Ina.. -
"You find me changed," said Ina.
"You have indeed been dreadfully
il. I almost feel conscience-stricken
when I see you; that I have been so
happy, whilst you have been so- suf-
fering."
" The wheel of fortune moves
around," said Ina, "now down, now
up, but each one is crushed by it in
turn."
" Yes," said Madame de Turenne,
" I too have had my trials."
"We have all had them, my dear,"
said Madame Benoni; " only there are
few, very few, who know how to sup-
port them with Christian fortitude, I
must confess.- I have always made
it a-point not to shrink from the tri-
als of life, but to bear my cross with
true 'resignation, and with that hu-
mility which is due to the command
of a higher Providence; and so far I
congratulate myself that I have suc-
ceeded."                .
Madame de Turenne turned away
her head to hide her smiles. "1D
you think you will go out soon ?'
she said. " The fresh air would do you
good. Will you not let me come an
take you eut soon?"
" Thank you. Madame Benoni ha
-offered me her coach, but I will giv

myself the pleasure of coming to see
you when I am able to go out."
" Ah," said Madame de Turenne,
looking at her watch, " I have an ap-
pointment with Eman - with Mon-
sieur Bertani," and she blushed scar-
let. "I did not know it was so late,
but I only ran in as I was passing to
see how you were, and I am so very
glad to find that you are better ! You
will come soon ? You know you
promised!"
She found Emanuele already await-
ing her. He was walking the room
impatiently as she entered.
"0," she said, "I am  so glad you
came first ! It is always I who stand
and wait. It is such a happy surprise
to find you here. I have just come
from Madame Benoni's. I saw Mad-
emoiselle Ina. 0 Emanuele, she is
so changed ! She is a perfect wreck.
She must have been terribly ill, poor
thing !  I felt so sorry for her I could
have cried. I .felt wickedly happy
when I saw her looking so ill."
Emanuele turned away his face, to
conceal the emotion that passed:over
it.
"Did she congratulate you on your
engagement ? did she seem to know
of it ?" said Emanuele, quickly.
" I do not know, I do not remem-
ber, but I think you are unkind to
- Mademoiselle Strohling. Any one
would feel pity for her if he saw
her, but you always did seem rather
to dislike her than otherwise, and
how you could I cannot imagine, for
 she is so interesting;" even now, faded,
d wan, emaciated as' she was, there
was something lovely about her still.
s I should have fallen in love with her,
e had I been a man. Poor MarcellO,1I

am afraid he is not happy in his
love! .'But let us talk of ourselves,"
she said, coming up to him, and lean-
ing on him. " Tell me that you love
me this morning just as well as you
did last evening. Ah, I always feel
afraid of losing your love, and I,-.-
jdtainne, je t'adore, je suis tort-w-ait

ately.
"And I," he said, pressing his lips
to hers, "return everything a thou-
sand-fold!"
"I want to tell you something,"
she, said, " Emanuele, that has been
on my heart, and weighs on it ; every
time I see you my' lips refuse to say
it. 0 dearest, do not be angry with
me, I love you with my whole being,
with every pulse, every sense, with
my mind and my soul, but before I
knew you I was very heartless. I fear,
-- and it is not vanity that speaks, -
I fear that I have made others suffer
very much, and .when I was uncer-
tain whether or no you loved me,
and lay tossing at night in a fever of
suspense, my lips parched, and my
eyes wet with tears,- for I did cry for
you," she said, looking up archly in
his face,-" I used to be frightened,
and wonder if it was a judgment
upon me, and if as I had done it was
requited unto me; but the worst of,
all as - it makes me cold at night
to think of'it, was -promise me to
love me all the same ! Ah, Eman-
nele, I was half engaged before I1
met you, only half ! and then I broke
it off so .coldly, without any mercy;
Was it not dreadful ? I did not know
what it was to hope, and lose all, and
he said to me, 'God bless you, Ca-
mnilla, but you will never be happy

if you destroy others' peace of mind,"
and Nina said the same thing to me
a few days afterwards, and it always
haunts me."
" If that is all your sin, I freely ab-
solve you, my enchantress."
" Ah, I am so glad you forgive me ;
but I cannot forgive myself !"
A few days after this Ina was sit-
ting alone in the same room with
Marcello; they had not spoken for
some time, when suddenly Ina looked
up and said, " I must go out, and.
alone ; how can I do so?"
"I will tell my mother that you
must take the air, that I will go with
you because you are not strong
enough to go alone, and that a man's
support is better than a woman's;
then, when we are out of sight of
the house, you can leave me, -and I
will wait for you until you return."
".You are kind," said Ina; "I think
it is the only way. Shall it be to-
morrow ?"
"It shall be whenever you wish; I
am at your service always."
" Then to-morrow at twelve o'clock
I will go."
Ina knew that that was Emanuele's
hour for being in his own apartment,
for he always returned home to take
breakfast at ten o'clock, and then
wrote until two; she had 'so often
heard him say that his hours were
always the same, and then she had
found him there before just at that
time. What would he say at receiving
another visit from her ? She cared not,
she must speak to him. What was he
now to her ? what was his displeasure,

no more of her now to be hurt, her
flesh had turned to stone, her heart
was dead. The next day at the ap-
pointed hour Marcello was awaiting
her in the parlor. They left the
house together. When they had come
under the porticos, Marcello said:
"You can leave me now. ~I will go
into some of these shops, and will
wait till you come; do not hasten
your steps."
She looked'at him mournfully, and
turned slowly'down aside street. She
arrived soon at Emanuele's door; she
rang the bell, and, merely saying
"Tell Signor Bertani that a lady
wishes to see him," passed on into his
sitting-room. She opened the door,
and there he sat with his back turned
to her.   He turned, and started
slightly when he saw her. She closed
the door, and then stood erect before
it, white as a marble statue and as
cold.
" You are surprised to see me
here; it is indeed the last place
where I should wish to see you, but
I have come, to speak to you for
the last time on earth ; there is a
gulf between us which never can be
passed.  I do not hate you," she
said, her face perfectly motionless,
save for the sharp lightning in her
eye, -li'ghtning not such as lights up
the sky in summer evenings, brighten-
ing and playing between the clouds
with sudden flashes, but with sharp,
cutting flames, such as scathe and,
blast. "I do not hate you," she said
slowly, "for that would speak of a
love that had been, and I' cannot
remember now that I ever loved you.
I despise you utterly. I even scorn
myself that I can stand and look at

you.- Something you have lost, like a
hideous idol that has once been
knelt to and worshipped as a god,
when the true knowledge has turned
its votary with loathing from it!
Something has been taken from you,
when a heart, fresh as morning and
light as air, scathed by    you and
heavy as lead, has forever left you
alone." She paused for breath, and
then continued ; " It is well for you
that you do not believe in immortal-
ity, or you would writhe at my feet
with that agonizing thought of where
your soul would go! .It is well for
you that you do not believe in a
life hereafter, where two women-
perhaps there are more wives still!
- would ever point at you, weeping
their lost honor, and an innocent
little child's face would turn away
from  you with perpetual horror. It
is a mercy too great for you that
you believe that you will be blotted
out when you die, and be as if yon
never had been. I pity myself for
having loved'you once, so much that
there is no pity left for you. I can-
not even pray to our Saviour to in-
tercede for you, because you have
rejected him. Live in your empty
fame, the petty puppet of a corrupt
nation, who hang upon . your false
words and applaud your -life's lie!
Live here happy, if yoig can, for then
comes eternal death, not in, annihi-
lation, as you believe, but in the
'unceasing memory of what you were
on earth ! Farewell. I can say these
words now~ without one touch- of
sorrow. You' are free, but not to dis.-
honor your son; that link can never
be severed, no, not -in eternity, ap~d it,

Farewell, and weep in wild regret, strode the floor in his agony. With
when I am gone, that there is not every card in his hands, had he lost

one chord left for you to break !"
She turned, and passed out of the
room noiselessly as she had entered
it.
"Ina," he cried, in despair; "Ina,"
he called aloud, - but only his own
voice echoed through his room.  He
sank back groaning, and covered his
face with his hands ; every time he
looked up he thought he saw her,
like a spirit of revenge, standing
before him, and her eyes burnt into
his brain. He had been lured on by
his ambition, his flattered vanity, his
love of luxury and wealth, to court
Camilla ; but now he was in love
with her, she had taken possession of
his fancy and his senses, she was
beautiful, and he felt her rich
Oriental beauty ; it was more to him
than Ina's more spiritual charms;
besides it was the last, the new love ;
and to reach his full rose he had
trodden on this blue violet, and had
crushed out its life with scarcely
one thought, after he had ceased to
care for her.  Until Camilla    had
wholly taken possession of his im-I
agination, he  felt regret, remorse,
repentance ; whilst still Ina's love-I
lines had some hold on him, he had
yearnings to set her right. But Ina c
was poor, in an obscure position;
Camilla was immensely rich, in the
most brilliant one. Ina was surround-
ed by, a thousand obstacles, she
could not assert herself, she had no
place; Camilla was free, and alone,
she dazzled him by all she held out
to him, and he - fell like 'Lucifer.
Now for the first time he saw it all I

forever his game ? Was that the
woman,- she who stood so terrible
there, like the last judgment,-was
that the soft, graceful Ina ? He re-
gretted her now that he had wholly
lost her. She was, like Anthony's
wife Fulvia, "good, being gone." The
hand that would have shoved her
off would gladly have plucked her
back again.   He regretted every-
thing; his mind was one wild chaos
from which he knew no escape.
As Ina turned the corner of Ber-
tani's street, she was startled by
seeing some one looking intently at
her ; her veil was thick, and. it was
drawn closely over her face ; she
looked again, started,-was it her
brother ? No, it could not be. She
turned, but he who had attracted
her attention had already disap-
peared around the corner, and she
dared not follow; she went back to
where Marcello was waiting in anxi-
etysfor her. He looked at her anx-
iously, and  was shocked   at the
change in her face ; the, unnatural
lustre in her eyes had not yet gone,
and this, with her excessive pallor,
made a contrast that was painful,
and almost frightened him. Mar-
cello knew nothing, but he began to
suspect many things.

"Ask her if she will do me the
kindness to come to my room.=- I
feel so indolent to-day," she said to
herself. She was reclining on her
sofa, her beautiful hair wa's let
down around her. shoulders, and
she had been trying to fasten her
attention on the book in her listless
hand.
"Come in," she said. "I am   so
glad to see you, I was so lonely.
Last night I had a note from
Monsieur Bertani, telling me he had
an appointment and could not come,
and I have been seeking ever since
some method of killing the time; do
tell me .how !   Ah, Mademoiselle
Strdhling, you have no weaknesses !
You would never allow yourself to
be so mastered by the tender passion.
But how ill you look !"
"How like you look to your pic-
ture !" said Ina, slowly.
"Yes, they say so;' do you fancy
it ?  I think it is a little too low, -
the chemise. I do not want Mon-
sieur Bertani to see it. Do you
think it looks indelicate, Mad-
emoiselle Strhling ?- I was very
thoughtless when I sat for that por-
trait. Now all is so different. What
a strange change love makes in one,
--I mean true love ! I do not know
why it is ~that I always feel my
heart drawn to talk with you of
all that I feel. I liked you from
the very first; did you like - me ?
4o you like me now, .rather ? For
- , the past I do not care. I only care
Sfor the present  I  m so happy in
it!"    ,
" Are you so happy ?" said Ina.
"0O, exquisitely so ! I never
dreamed of thief ; it seems as if life

were just opening to me. I feel like
spring, full of the rustle of a fresh
wakening."
"And suppose," said Ina, "that it
should all suddenly be taken from
you, that you should be told that
Monsieur Bertani did not love you,
what should you do,?"
"I should try," she said, laughing,
"to let my pride get the better of
my love." And then a more earnest
expression- came over her face, and
she said, " I think it would kill me!"
"But," she said, taking Ina's hand
tenderly in hers, "you will not be
vexed, nor think I take too great a
liberty with you, if I ask you why-
you do not smile on poor Marcello;
he is so good, so true, so noble-mind-
ed, and he loves you with his whole
soul. Why, do you      know, Mad-
emoiselle Strihling, I am going to
make you a confession. I was al-
most in love with him myself once,
but he never liked me. A slight
obstacle blew the flame. But when
I saw that he was really invincible,
then I got over it. I had had so
many men at my feet that it never
occurred to me that if I tried to win
him he would not be won. Now I
tell you all this out of generosity,
because it makes a woman love a
man better if she thinks others'have
loved him also ; is it not so? Now
won't you marry Marcello just to
make me happy ?"- she said coax-
ingly.
" I am married already," said Ina,
hoarsely. '
" Good God, to him ! You do not
mean so. 0, how can you, wear such
a' mask ? I never would have be.-
lieved it. But tell me, but quickly,

how it all happened. Was it lately,
to-day? 0 speak!" .
"No, to Monsieur Bertani," said
Ina, looking Camilla fixedly in the
eyes. It was a comfort in that mo-
ment to her to know that she could
inflict some torture equal-to her own.
"Is there another Monsieur Ber-
tani in the world ? "
"None that I know of; my hus-
band is Monsieur Emanuele Ber-
tani."
"You frighten me," said Madame
de Turenne, springing up, and mov-
ing a little away from Ina. "Are
you speaking in earnest," (then she
thought, " She is really mad,") "or
are you in jest ? "
But Ina rose too, and put out her
hand, gas if to say "Do not go."
Then she said quietly, "Do not be
frightened. I am myself as perfect-
ly as you are yourself. I am mar-
ried before God to Emanuele Ber-
tani. It is now one year and three
months since our marriage. I loved
him more than you love him, be-I
cause I was alone in the world,1
because I had no one to care for save
him. And he was my first and only
love. He took me to Switzerfand
and married me there, under promise
of secrecy. We were married in my'
faith. I was innocent of its not ]
being a legal marriage in a Catholic
country. He did not tell me that 1
until after he had met you. I was I
at the mask-ball the night you told
him of your love. I was behinds
you, and heard all."                t
"0 God ! 0 God ! " said Camilla, ~
Cowering before her. ." 0 save me ! s
o save me ! I love him, I love him ! "'
o God, help me !" and she tore her i

hair in her despair. Then, starting
up, she looked wildly around as if
she heard something, and uttered
these words, which Ina did not un-
derstand, -" That low cry !"
"I would not have spoken," said
Ina. "I have had my heart killed,
and I know the agony of pain. I
know all life's torture, but I would
not have spoken for myself, not to
revenge myself.- I would have been si-
lent until.death, but another's life was
mine. I could not wrong my child."
"That too !" said Camilla, shudder-
ing; "you have been happier than
I."  She looked up at Ina then, and
saw such deadly despair pass over
her face that she forgot herself. "0
Ina," she said, "forgive me ! you
have suffered more than I, my
poor broken-hearted , sister !"  And
she burst into tears, and flung her
arms around her neck. Ia uttered
a suppressed sob, and laid her head
on Camilla's shoulder. " Poor thing !
poor thing !" said Camilla, kissing
her cheek. "0    my God, help us
both ! Ina, can you forgive me all
the pain I have unwillingly inflicted?
This one pang of mine was vengeance
enough !"
"I have nothing to forgive," said
Ina; "you were innocent of all wrong.
Farewell, my sister; our paths are
wide apart ; both have to suffer, but
both can learn to say, 'Thy will,
thy will, not ours be done."
Camilla was alone again, and she
stood still as if she were rooted to
the ground.   Great burning spots
were on her cheeks, her eyes were
wollen and heavy with weeping.

venged. Come and drink it in, - the
sweet draught of revenge ! He said so.

others unhappy!' Did he pray that
I might not be ? This is cruel, and
yet I deserved it all. 0 God, suppose
I cannot cease to love him, what
should I do ? Ah, how dreary life
looks! What shall I do with myyouth,
my love, my beauty, as he calledit?
How. shall I pass my time? how will,
the days go by, the weeks, the years?
Can I die ? I am so strong. 0, let
me die !" and she flung herself upon
her knees, and prayed God for death.
"And Ina has suffered worse pain than
this? 0 no, because she has no re-
morse; and yet is that not more ter-
rible, knowing it is not merited? He
loved me. I hate him. I should like
to kill him. He feigned love for my
wealth. It would be a consolation, in
all his baseness, to know he loved me;
but how get at the bottom of his
soul?" 
"Monsieur Bertani !" said the man
waiter.
"Show him in," said Camilla.
"In here, Madame ?"
Yes, just here ! - Have you not
heard my orders ?"
Bertani entered, and the door was
closed behind him. One look told him
that she knew all.
" Come- here !" she said, standing
erect before him, and pointing impe-
riously with her finger to the place
where she wished him to come to.
"Stand there, and listen to me. Do
not approach me, or I shall flay you
perhaps with my own hands. 0, you
thought my beauty was soft and
womanly ! you thought my eyes were

made for love ! Look in themnow,

Nero, you would make for yourself
music, that the cries of those that
are burning in the flames kindled by
your own hands might not reach you,
I find no name. bad enough; seducer,
betrayer, are too fair for you !"
" Camilla," he began.
"Do not speak my name, do not
soil it by breathing on it again, leave
what you can of it pure. And even
my fortune was to gild your triumphs,
not I ! Beauty, truth, gentleness,
were not enough, because you found
them poor and obsc-urely hidden, but
you must have wealth !"
"Madame de Turenne, I swear that,
I loved you, not your wealth. I was
led away,,dazzled."
0, take no oaths!" she said; "they
are all broken on youi; lips ! You
have no honor to swear by. I pity
you from   the bottom   of my soul
Now go, and take with you the ha.
tred of two women!")
Bertani groaned; he remembered
that lIla had not even accorded himi
her hatred or her pity.
"Farewell," he said, " Camilla ;may
you learn some day to forgive !"

"Never," she said, and she. pointed
to the door._ He went out of it; it shut
behind him, and Camilla threw her-
self on her sofa in an agony of tears.
CHAPTER XVII.
B ERTANI was alone in his room
when a knock was heard at it.
He went to the door and opened it ;
it was Marcello. " Come in," he said
hoarsely ; "it is long since I have
seen you."
"Yes," said Marcello ; "you are
much absorbed in your new happi-
ness, and none, who knew the cause,
could blame you !"
"Sit down," said Bertani, handing
him a chair, " and 'take a cigar ! "
"I will not sit down with you
until you have explained to me
your conduct ! An ignominious love
is a thing to be ashamed of,. but a
manly devotion of the heart, although
without hope, for a pure woman, is
ennobling to the man who feels it. I
have no false pride, and I shrink not
from saying that a. lady whom you
have falsely dealt with I love. That
lady has cruelly suffered at your hand;
and I conie here to. ask satisfaction
for her, or, by Heaven, Bertani, your,
blood shall answer it for me ! "
"Take care what you say," said
Bertani, while the dark blood mantled
his brow ; " no one' shall ask an ex-
planation of my actions. I have loved
you, Marcello, more than a brother,
but I will not bear from'you what I
would not from a brother. I am free
to do as I choose. I recognize no
-laws save those that man creates for
himself." -

" No, you are not free,; the laws of
society, of the Bible, of humanity,
bind all men. So long as a man lives,
he is not free; if he were, there would
be nothing but rapine, murder, vio-
lence, and seduction. It is just this
that civilization and Christianity have
taught us, that we are bound to re-
spect each other's rights, each other's
property. Each human creature has
a moral responsibility, and this .he
must uphold, orfall himself; it is not
with impunity that we can sin."
" Perhaps not, where the property
of others is concerned, but I deny
that I have ever robbed any man of
what belonged to him; these things
are mutual contracts, my dear Mar-
cello, where we give and receive."
"It is false," said Marcello ; "a fee-
ble, innocent woman is not on an
equality with a cold man of the
world. What does she know of his
arts, of his power? You completely
enshare her, and then you make her
your victim. And you shall trample
no human heart in which I have an
interest in the dust, and, by Heaven,
Bertani, if you marry Madame de {
Turenne, it will have to be after my
voice is first hushed forever, and my
arm made powerless by death; for,
so long as I live, I will protect her
whom you have wronged,
"And whom,pray, have I wronged?"
said Bertani, angrily. "You shall
answer with your blood for this."
" Be it so. It is Ina Str5hling of
whom I speak."   As Marcello spoke,
both of them had moved towards the
window. Bertani's'apartment was on
the -first floor. Emanuele leaned a
little out of the window, and, pointing.
to some one who was standing be-

low, said coldly: "Perhaps it would
be as well to lower your voice, and
not to give to the whole city the
name of her whose cause you are
about to vindicate." Just at that
moment the loud report of a pistol
was heard, and Emanuele Bertani
fell headlong on the floor of his
room. Marcello stared at him for a
moment without being able to take
in what had happened ; then he
threw himself down by his side and
called, "Bertani, Bertani!" but there
was no sound, no motion; he rushed
to the door. "Help help !" he cried,
"for God's sake, help !" A man ran
up stairs. "Help !" he repeated,"he is
dying - dead ! tell some one to come,!
go for the surgeon !" and he went
back to Bertani, and knelt down by
his side. Some men came in, Marcello
did not know who they were; they
raised Bertani and put him on the bed.
The blood was flowing warm from his
chest ; they tried to stanch it with
towels bathed in cold water. His eyes
were shut, and his face was sharp as
if it had been chiselled in marble.
"'In the midst .of life we are in
death,'" thought - Marcello, as, he
looked down at his friend, so lately
full of life and power, now stretched
helplessly there. He could do no more
harm now. Marcello felt that all his
resentment was dead; his angry words
had been hushed on his lips. -Other
hands had wrought revenge, -whose
could .they have been? *Was it an
accidental shot? or was it from some
one deeply injured as he was, -some
one who had had the honor, too, of
his beloved to redress ? Should he
himself be implicated ? How clear
himself ? He had come there indeed

thirsting for blood but not without
a fair trial betwe  them, not to take
him by surpris , not to stab him
when his eyes were turned away
"He was bra e," said Marcello to
himself, "he was full of courage,--. not
the courage which a Christian life
brings, when one fears not because
no mortal arm can kill the soul, but
with the keen courage of a cold
philosophy, which taught him that
fate was fate, and it was "useless to
struggle against its mandates. He was
strong, he was brilliant, and full of
intellectual force; but he had no
guiding star of faith, no hope in a
better world, in a higher life, and so
he made his kingdom on this earth,
and he was his own god. Poor, power-
less thing! see now how a superior
power mocks at him ! He cannot raise
his hand, even for mercy. That grand
brow was made by One greater than
he, and its thought, now still, was
given by One who will not be frus-
trated in his plans. 0, at the last,
how all disappears ! how all worldly,
grandeur vanishes away like a mist!
'We brought nothing into this world,
we can take nothing out.' All our
work crumbles into dust before our
eyes, and the few good acts we have
done' bend over us, and hover around
us, like bright spirits from  another
land ; they are   our prayers then,
which ascend to the Almighty, and
with outstretched arms intercede for
us at his throne of grace."
A knock at the door roused Mar-
cello from .his reveries, and he went
silently to' it, and opened it. It was
the surgeon, Dr. B-. H~e was a

since been made physician of the
court; lie had a'kind, gentle face, full
of love, and overflowing with human
sympathies.
lie walked slowly up to the bed,
and took the unconscious man's hand
in his; he felt his pulse, he opened
his vest and shirt, and put his ear to
his heart; then he began examining
the wound. He asked Marcello for a
basin.
"Do you want help ?" said Mar-
cello.
"No, I prefer to be alone with
you."
"Is the wound very dangerous?"
said Marcello. " Can he live ?"
The surgeon sighed deeply. Mar-
cell saw the tears spring to his
eyes. " This is sad work," he said, as
he examined more closely; "had it
been one hair's-breadth more to the
right, there had been hope, but, as it
is, it is mortal. It seems to me im-
possible. Why, I saw him only this
morning, and spoke to him as he
passed, but I thought he looked
as if his sky was clouded. I even
turned and glanced after him, and I
remember wondering what had gone
wrong now   in the Cabinet. IRoor
Bertani! he had a grand intelligence,
but something was wanting here,"
he said, pointing to his heart. "' A
man cannot live without a guiding
principle, and I felt this want in our
friend even from the first. Freedom
we are permitted for a long time,
and prosperity follows even our bad
actions, but it is always within a
given compass, and in the end a
higher Power asserts itself. It seems
as if God were watching sometimes

to see how much we could accom-
plish by ourselves alone, and how far
we could go ! You must keep our
friend per ctly quiet, see that he is
not agitated; do not talk with him,
and do not leave him alone a .mo-
ment, lest his bandages should slip.
I will call again in a few hours."
Marcello was alone with Bertani.
0, how many thoughts rushed over
him! What now would become of
Ina? He felt sure that in some mys-
terious way her life was bound up
with that of Bertani; how he knew
not. Who would break to her this
news ? And Madame de Turenne, his
affianced bride, - what would now
become of all her brilliancy? How
changed seemed all their lives ! and
he alone knew of the dreadful disas-
ter that was hanging over them, he
alone sat by and watched the dying
man ! There he sat for an hour, always
with his eyes fixed on Bertani's pale
face, when suddenly he started, his
heart beat like a drum, Bertani's
large -dark eyes were open, and he
was looking at him; he could not
turn away from that gaze, and yet it
took away his strength.
"It is the finger of God," said Ber-
tani, slowly ;. "it is the righteous
judgment of sin. I know it now too
late! and there is no hope. Death !
he murmured, - "to go alone through
the dark valley I Marcello, speak to
me, comfort me, stay by me."
The cold perspiration stood on his
brow, like great beads.
"I will stay by you," said Mar-
cello, "but you must be perfectly
quiet; these were the orders left by
the surgeon."~

heal, therefore let me speak; as you
will wish mercy to your soul hereaf.
ter, listen. I must speak. I married
Ina Strohling fifteen monis ago. I
loved her. I took her away with me
to Switzerland, where we could be
married in the Protestant Church, I
wished then to keep my marriage
secret until my position should be
secured. I did not wish to be dragged
down by poverty and family cares.
Our marriage vows were never con-
firmed; therefore it was illegal; be-
fore man, no marriage ! When I saw
my honors increasing, I forgot my
honor, and thought to take advantage
of this letter f the law to 'be free,
and so I did. Then I fell in love
with another woman,. and asked her
to be my wife ; she consented, not
knowing anything of my treachery
and baseness. Ina has a son; he has
no name, no father; I must give him
both. It is the only restitution I can
make. Yku who love her - yes, I
know that=- must go to her, entreat
her to come to me, and to accept all
that is left for me to give on earth.
I thust to you, for you cannot deceive ;
and then you cannot hate. me now, for
your rival lies crushed and humbled
before you, never to rise again ; will
you do this ? 0," he said, " if you knew
their burning fever that is 'eating up
my strength, you would not refuse
me anything ! Go, for God's sake, and
implore her, not in my name, - that
has no claims on her mercy, - but in
yours.  Tell her to come for her
child's sake. And first go for a priest
to unite us. -0, go, go, Marcello!
There is no time to lose," and he
"daenot leave you. said Mae-

cello ; "the doctor said you must not
- be alone, you might lose too much
blood."
"I have lost too much already," he
said, turning his ashen face to Mar,
cello; it was all sunken away already,
and his eyes looked like two great
dark stars.
Marcello looked at him, and such
t pity came into his soul that he said
-quickly; "I will go."  He thought to
himself, " He cannot live, and it is
better to give him   peace of mind
than a few hours more of misery."
So he hastened a way. His first steps
were directed to a priest's house, one
whom he knew well.
"Father," he said, "this is no time
for words. Bertani, our statesman, is
dying, shot through   the breast by
some deadly enemy. Go to him with
the extreme unction, and absolve his
soul if you can!"
"I will go, my son, immediately,"
and Marcello hastened to his own,
house. 0, with what heavy steps
he ascended the stairs ! He opened
the front 'door ; all was unchanged,
there was no hurry there, no dull
silence like that, he had left ; could
things look so, and he have passed
through so much? A servant was in
the entry ; he heard the canary-bird
singing at the top of its voice.
"Where was his mother'?" Gone out,
for the first time in the open carriage!-
' His father ?" Monsieur had not re-
turned since he left the house, after
breakfast. " The young ladies ?"
They had gone with Madame! and
last of all he said, "And Mademoi.-
selle Striihling ?" "She is in her
room, sir !" Ah, she was at home, -
she, the, only one whom he would

gladly have found not there ! He
must see her, he must confront her
eyes, with this too  terrible news.
How.would she take it?  Would it
kill her ? Two dead in one day ! He
had not been able to arrange his
thoughts before ; now it all hurried
like a great chaos before his mind.
He went straight to Ina's room. She
opened the door suddenly as he ap-
proached it, and looked out nervous-
ly. "I thought something was the
matter," she said, in an apologetic
tone of voice ; " you opened the front
door so hastily."
"May I come in ?" he said.
"Yes," she answered. The room was
strewn with her clothes, and two
trunks stood open, with their trays
on the floor.
" Are you going away ?" he said
absently.
She looked at him with a strange
perplexed air, and said "Yes !" She
looked at him now with her eyes
fixed into a terrible stare ; he-shrank
before their unnatural gaze.
"Th6re is blood on you,". she said
slowly ; "whence does it come ? - a
spot on your shirt, and look at your
hand !"
He looked down to the place where
her eyes rested ; he had not noticed it
himself; he saw it now, and shud-
dered.
"Ina," he said, "it is the blood, of
him you once loved, but not spilt by
me; no, I take God to witness that
I am innocent of it." She stood ever
looking at him   with  that vacant
stare. He went up to her and touched
her arm; she shrank shivering from
him.                      .- ~
,"lIna," he said, "the shot came

from  outside, not from  my'hands;
before God, I swear it to you!"
Ina leaned against the door for
support, and uttered a low scream of
agony ; she put her hands quickly be-
fore her eyes, as if to shut out the
light. "I know it, I know it, I told
him so," she mu   ured. "0 God !"
" Ina, he is dyi g, and you must go
to him; he implo kes you to come."
"I am   ready,' said Ina, and she
looked at him abs ntly; "why do you
not take me ?"
"Ina dearest, you must collect
yourself; put on yo r hat, and we
will go together ; the carriage is at
the door. If he should die, you would
never.forgive yourself if you were not
there. Ina,"' he continued, "listen.
I know all. I was with him when it
happened.   He lay unconscious for
some time, and then he spoke to me,
and told me all, - yes, all. He wants
you now that he may give you his.
name; the priest will be awaiting you,
and dying he willgive you those rights
which he denied you living: You
will not refuse him this consolation,
you will not refuse to him his resti-
tution."
' She looked up lifelessly in his
face ; she came and stood before
him so quietly, as she was fastening
on her hat, and she said, "I cannot,
I cannot, Marcello. I am his wife
before God. I care not for man. I
cannot put my hand in his- again.
I will not bear his name."
Marcello led her gently down
stairs, into the carriage, and they
drove rapidly to the apartment
where a few days before Ina had
been. The news had already begun
to spread. A crowd of people had

gathered around the door. They
were kept back from   entering by
Bertani's faithful domestic and the
gendarmes.  The   excitement was
intense as Marcello's carriage drove
up to the door, and he helped Ina
out of it. They pressed forward to
look at her ; but Marcello, sustaining
her with one arm, with the other
motioned off the men and women
that were foremost in their curiosity.
Ina shrank away 'from  them with
terror, and Marcello drew her up
stairs. He. opened the door, and
there lay the man whom    she had
loved so madly once, white as death,
with his .eyes fixed on the -door.
Marcello drew Ina's unresisting form
towards the bed.
"Have you come ?" said Eman-
uele. "I knew    you would ; you
were ever too good to refuse comfort
to a human creature. Stoop down,
and let me whisper in your ear."
She bent her head as if it were me-
chanically, for she did not look as if
she understood what he said; and
then suddenly she uttered' another
scream, just such as Marcello had
heard in her room when he had told
her that he had not shed Enanuele's
blood. And now through the si-
lence-. was heard a solemn tinkle,
tinkle of a little bell,-a bell that
was ringing out a life,-a bell that
told of the death agony, of confession,
repentance, and absolution, - a bell
that makes all busy passers-by stop for
a moment their hurried footsteps, and
pause before the crowding thoughts
I   of life, and feel that this little bell
might have been sounding for one
they loved, perhaps for themselves;
and God himself seems walking

amongst the crowd, and awe and
reverence and love fill their souls,
Nearer and nearer it came, with tle
priest in white, and the Host in his:
hand, and the baldachin that covers
it, and the torches that light him to
his work of -faith. The door opened,
and he stood on Emanuele's threshold,
Bertani heard it, and every pulse
started into life; he raised himself
on his pillow and glared at the ser-
vant of the Lord.  "Away," he cried,
"away with your false mummeries
I will die, as I have lived, out of the
Church. No man can save my soul;
He alone whom I have ~denied can
do that now. No man with his cor-
rupt heart can step between me and
the Almighty. I have faced my life,
I will face my death ; and not like
a coward think to creep into heaven
under the bloody frock of your re-
ligion. Away!!" he said, with such
vehemence that Marcello approached
the door of the room, and made a.
sign for the priest to move back.
The priest looked very angry, but
Marcello said to him, "Father, re-
member that we are in the presence
of the Lord. - Your calling is holy;
wait until I come to you with some
words of hope; .there is more virtue
in religion when there is more to
forgive."
He returned to Emanuele's room;
he had sunk back exhausted on his
pillow, but his eyes were open. "I
will not confess to man," he said,
" save as to my equal. I have told
you my faults, I wish to repair them;
let that suffice."'
"It 'cannot be," said Marcello;
" to git.e Ina your name, you must
first confess your sins to the priest."'

aIs that indeed' so ? I had forgot ;
then let him come, I care not."
"But I will not bear your name,"
said Ina, firmly. "I will not be
your wife."
A sharp spasm passed over Eman-
uele's face, and he said, "Ina, for
God's sake, forgive ! I believe that
we all have to stand before the judg-
ment-seat; let me take your forgive-
ness there ! "
"I forgive you," said Ina, her face
perfectly immovable, her large, blue
eyes always averted, "but I cannot
be your wife; let me be free !"
" Death will set you free," he said,
"erelong. Ina, in the name of your
past love, for pity's sake, for my soul's
sake ! Ina, I believe that I have a
soul."
She shook her head, and said
slowly, " I cannot bear your name."
Emanuele's whole face was. con-
vulsed; he writhed in bed.    Then
there was a silence; then he lifted
himself up, and, clasping his hands,
said, "Ina, for his sake, for the
child's future, for our boy, 0, take
my worthless name, and he will set
it again, and give it lustre, Ina,
that I may not die on, earth ! 0,

may redress his wrongs; it/ is all
that is left me of my was, d life.
Marcello," he said, "plead or me,
move her heart. Ah, once it was all
love and pity! Ina, not on me then,
on our boy, have some mercy! I am
dying," he said, gasping for breath,
Ina turned and put her cold hand'
in his ; his was damp. .
"Let it be, then, as you wish; I
will take your name, and give it to
our boy !" .

He looked up at her with a glance
of intense and unspeakable gratitude,
and closed his eyes; soon he opened
them again, and made a sign to
Marcello. Marcello bent his ear,
and then went to the door; he made
a sign to Ina to follow him. And
then the priest came in alone ; he
was about a quarter of an hour there,
when he opened the door again, and
let in Ina and Marcello. He opened
his book. Ina went and stood by
the bedside. The priest took   off
her little ring, that had been placed
on her finger more than a year ago,
when her life was full and fresh
and young. He placed her hand in
Emanuele's, and then performed over
them the ceremony' which should
unite them once more until death
should separate them so soon ! And
when it was finished he laid his
hands upon their heads, and left
them.
There was a great silence in the
room, but there was a surging of
voices without, and shouts of Ber-
tani and vengeance came up through
the air and broke the stillness with-
in. Strict orders had been given
that no one should be admitted to
Bertani's room. Ina sat down by
Emanuele's bedside. "Do not take
away your hand," 'he said; "it does
me good." .She left it in his. Thus
they sat, silently, for hours. The
doctor came and looked at Ina
strangely. Was this pale woman,
moving and looking like a spirit, the
brilliant person to whom he had
heard that Bertani was betrothed ?
They had painted her as a Cleopa-
tra, and Ina looked to him like
the broken-hearted Mary ! He felt

Emanuele's pulse. Marcello looked
at him; he saw him shake his head.
He looked at the wound; it was
bleeding afresh. There was no pos-
sible hope, that he knew, but he
could not bear to give him up. So
strong, so stalwart a form, now pros-
trate there; was it true that he
could ' never  move   again ?  Her
seemed to breathe with less difficulty,
but he evidently did not know that
the doctor was there. The doctor
stood some time watching him, and
then said, " I must go ; there is noth-
ing more to be done !"
" Doctor," said Emanuele, opening
his eyes very suddenly, " there must
be no trouble caused by my death;
it was not from my friend's hand ;
we were alone, but it came from
without. I had a mortal enemy."
Ina covered her face with her hands.
"Do you understand it all?" he said
dreamily, and then he muttered to
himself, "-One enemy, one friend, two
loves, both lost," a.nd he went on
ever repeating these words, until
gradually his voice died away ; then
the room was perfectly still, and for
hours Ina and Marcello sat with no
sound between them save the tick-
ing of. the clock, which sounded
startlingly loud. Marcello went'up
and put his hand on the pendulum;
it seemed as if it was ticking away
the life of him who lay there.
Give me your hand, Ina," he
said. " We are passing into the church.
How lonely it looks.! but I will be
your all! I will stand in the place
of -your mother and your father and
/your brother to you. Sweet, where is
your ring ? Ah, who is that false
monster who wooes you to be his ? Re,

wife and his son; strike. at himg
Then he was silent. Later she heard
him vhisper,"Camilla, forgive";c"Ina,
forgive"; "Two to witness against
me ! that is two too many !" ' All day
this lasted, and at twilight he was
quiet; by the dim light Ina saw a
change come over his face ; he gasped,
and then all was still. She called
Marcello ; all was over. At that no-
ment, as they both stood, awe-strick-
en, before all that remained of
Emanuele    Bertani, they  heard a
rustle outside of the door. It opened
noiselessly, and a woman glided in;.
she went straight to the bed, gave
one look at him she loved still, and
then threw herself on her knees at
his side, and burst into passionate
sobs, that seemed as if they would
break her heart. Ina, knelt down
beside her, and, putting her arm
around her neck, hid her face on her
shoulder.  There was no rivalship
between those two women now, they
neither of them claimed the dead!
CHAPTER XVIII.
YEAR had passed by since Ber-
A tani's death ; for two months
nothing else had occupied the public
mind. Why the murder had been
committed, why Bertani had married
Ina at the last, no one knew. No
trace of the murderer ever was found.
The whole of Turin was turned up-
side down for. a time ;. the police
were telegraphing all over the coun-
try, but no track was found of him
who had done the deed ; people were

minister occupied his place. Imme-
diately after his death Ina had gone
back to Switzerland. She could not
live there now, it was too full of
terrible memories. She could not
go where her home once was, for
she knew not what had become
of her brother and she dared not
inquire; he was worse than   dead
to her. She could not live in Turin,
and she had determined to go to
Genoa, to spend the rest of her weary
days.
She took Sofi and her baby, and
found a little apartment there, where
she could live modestly with them;
for the small property'that Bertani
had her son had inherited, and she
was his natural guardian.  Ina was
sitting by the fire. Sardo was ather
feet; lie held the baby's little boot in
his mouth. The baby was dark-eyed, a
living resemblance of his father ; often
when Ina looked at him    her face
would become sadder still, and she
would turn away, in the midst of her
most tender caresses, and his most
winning ways, to hide the great sigh
that was rising to her heart. Little
as lie was, he had expressions of his
face that she thought terribly like
Emanuele ; it was a new misery
to~ her, and, passionately as she
loved him, she never saw him with-
out pain.
"Madame," said Sofi, " will you
never go out to take the fresh air?
It breaks my heart to see you always

two blessings."
A knock was heard at the door.
Ina started, and a deep color, the
first Sofi had seen since her return,
spread itself over her face. "For
God's sake, go to the door, Sofi! and
I will see no one, no one," she said in
an agonized voice.
"Is Madame Bertani in ?"    Ina
started again ; it was the first time
she had ever heard that name. How
it knocked dully at her heart ! Yet it
was not his, the one dreaded voice ;
that was a relief. In a moment more
Sofi came in smiling, and behind her
was Marcello.   Ina's face flushed
slightly, and she rose quickly to
meet him; his face beamed with
pleasure, and with deeper emotions, as
he looked at her. " How long it'is,"
he said, "since I have seen you ! I
could not wait any longer. I wanted
to see you in your new home ; to see
Sofi and this lovely boy," he said,
raising him in his arms, and throwing
him up in the air. The child laughed,
and said "Papa!" Marcello dropped
him  quickly, and Ina turned away
her head. " He is beautiful," said
Marcello, "grand, magnificent.  He
is very like his father, with all that
was finest in his face, and a noble ex-
pression."  He said this purposely.
He thought it best to break the ice
at once. Ina felt grateful to him,
and she turned and smiled upon him
a sad, gentle smile.
" How is your mother ? " she said,

"and your good, dear father, and the
children ? I never forget them." ;
" My mother's nerves have, acquired
new force," he said, smiling. "My
father, thank God, is well; he grows
younger every day of his life. And
the girls are prettier than they were.
Theft sent you shoals of love."
"Did they know that you were
coming,?"
" Yes, and even my mother ap-
proved of my journey. Ina," he said,
"will you not go and take a little walk
with me ?"
"Do take her," said Sofi. " Poor
thing ! she has never been out of the
house since we first came here ; it is
more than eleven months. I cannot
force her out.'
"1Do come, dear Ina, for my sake.
It is not right to your boy to ,shut
yourself up so; he will expect you
to go with him some day, and you
should be so proud to take him out!"
" Well, I will go with you," said
Ina; "if Sofi and baby will come too! '
Many were the people that day that
turned in the street to see the pale
young lady and the beautiful laugh-
ing boy.
That evening, as they sat together,
Marcello said,." I have good news,
Ina, for you. 'Madame de Turenne is
going to be married.;. she is engaged
to her constant lover, Miro Raimondi.
She has signed away the principal
part of her fortune to an institution
for orphans, just out of Turin, 'and
she is going to live in the country
with her husband; and when I asked
her why she had not waited until
her death before making such a mu-
nificent gift, she said, with something
of her old vivacity, ' I am tired of

being rich, and now my caprice is to
be poor ; if I am not satisfied, if the
novelty palls after a time, I think I
shall write for them to give it back
to me ; do you not think that is a
good arrangement?'     I wish you
could see her now. I never saw her
look half so charming before; and
she sent more rove than I knew how
to load myself with, and something,
besides, that' I may not give," he
said, with a pleasant laugh.
"It is so delightful," said Ina, "to
hear your voice again; it sounds like
hope and promise ! You always were
cheerful, Marcello, and one feels it
in your presence.   I think, cheerful-
ness one of the most beautiful gifts
one can have. I hope my little Theo-
dore will be so."
"Ah, Ina, it is a plant that does
not spread nor grow without cultiva-
tion ; often when I feel most down=
hearted, I Zry to shake it off by a
manner that belies it. You must try,
dear Ina, to create an atmosphere
about your darling ; children, all the
young, need the sunshine of life
around them ; and that shines in the
house as brightly as. without, if we
choose."
" Sofi often tells me so," said Ina,
with a deep sigh. "I think I will fill
the house with flowers ; that will
make it look brighter.  I remember,
when I was a little child, I loved
roses better than any toys that muy
mother bought me."
" I- believe it," said Marcello ; "you
must have taken them for your sis-
ters."
" I always used to ask my mamma
to give me a little 'sister," said Ina.
" I think the life of a child so lonely

without other children. I often think
that we must look like great giants
to them, and frighten them  at first,
as we do the birds, that are- not ac-
customed to us."
"But had you not a brother who
was a companion for you ? "
Ina's whole face was convulsed with
pain; she rose and looked out of the
window. Marcello sprang to her side.
"Ina, what have I said ? what have'
I unwittingly done ?"
"Nothing," she said gently, putting
her hand on his arm; "you are my
only brother."
He took her hand in his, and
pressed it tp his lips. "Do notsayso,"
he said. "I should never be satisfied
thus. I must be nearer to, you, Ina,
than that. You know that I love you
with a 'love deeper, truer, intenser,
than a brother gives. Ina, will you
not be my wife?" She turned towards
him and fixed her large blue eyes
upon  him; all the light was gone
out of them, just as he had seen them
look that first day after the mask-
ball; there was a vacant stare in
them now as then ; it terrified him.
" Ina," he said, " do you not under-
stand me ? I love you!"
"He said so too !" she said in a
loiv, plaintive voice, not turning awayi
her eyes, that had always the same
expression, --l"he said so too!"
"0 dearest, do not look at me so !
Put your hand in mine, and say youj
will be my beloved wife. Ina, for
mercy's sake,. speak ! "
"He asked me to be his wife," she
said ; -"he said he loved me, and asked -
me to be his wife." -
Marcello turned away; he could I
not stand it, that blank look cut him

to the heart. " 0,"    said to him-
self, "how much loger must I live
alone, how much longer bear my
sorrow? Why am I doomed to this
lonely love ?" He went out of the
room in search of the baby. The little
Theodore crowed aloud when he saw
him, and stretched out both his arms
with a glad cry. "Papa," he said,
pointing with his little finger, and
looking around up into Sofi's face.
" Do not let him say that," he said
to Sofi; "it pains me !" and he took
the child in his arms, and carried
him in to Ina. When she saw her
baby, all the natural look came back
again into her face, and she looked at
Marcello as if nothing especial had
passed between them a moment be-
fore. "God help her !" he said to him-
self as he placed her little one in her
arms, "but I will not leave her alone.
This solitary life, ever dwelling on
her grief, will kill her, or, worse than
that, will put out the light of her
mind. I promised her once that I
would be a friend that asked for no
recompense, and that I would serve
her with all my soul; so it shall be."
Marcello went back to Turin short-
ly after this, but it was to make his
preparations for transferring' his busi-
ness to Genoa; before leaving he told
Ina this, and she looked up in his face
and smiled. He carried that smile
in his heart, and it was the one
flower in his lonely path, it was his
arc-en-ciel, and he held it as a
promise of brighter days. When he
came back he brought his sister
Adelheide to keep house for him, and
often she used to pass the day with
Ina, and there was life. in the quiet
Little house ; and in a few months

more Marcello spoke again to Ina,
and again the terrible look came into
her eyes, and dropped as a veil be-
tween him and them, and she an-
swered, "He said so too; he said he
loved me, and asked me to be his
wife!"   Marcello went back dis-
heartened to- his lonely apartment,
and that evening, as he sat moodily
looking into the fire, his sister Adel-
heide rose from her seat, and came
around to where he was, and stood
behind his chair, and put her arms
about his neck, and her head down
close to his ear, and whispered gently,
"Dear brother, it is yet too soon ; wait,
and, all will .be well."  Marcello
kissed her hair, and a gleam of hope
lighted his-eyes.
And gradually Ina's color stole
back into her face ; slowly,.slowly at
first ; but Marcello and Adelheide
saw that she should never be too
much alone. They took her to walk,
and to drive, and to row on the Medi-
terranean Sea. First she let. herself
be taken, as if she were a child without
a will, and then the listless look left
her face ; she would smile sweetly
when her boy laughed, no longer
that sad, wan smile; her step grew
lighter, and her face got back its
look- of youth.  Ina was twenty-two
years old, and two years had rolled
around since Emanuele's death. Ad-
ellieide read with her, and whenever
she saw the sharp look of pain pass
over her face, she suddenly had some-
where&amp;to go where Ina must take her,
or something important to ask that
only ma could answer. Marcello
was called away at this time on busi-
ness to Turin; he came back sooner
than he was expected. Ina was

alone in the parlor when he entered;'
she was reading, and, hearing a step,
turned, thinking it was Adelheide;
but her whole face flushed crimson
when she saw Marcello, and then she
put out her hand and blushed again
to .her temples as she said, "You
took me so by surprise !"
" I did not think 'myself," he said,
"that I should return    so soon. I
hastened back, fearing that Adelheide
would not take good care of you in
my absence. I have a letter for
you; from whom, do you think ?"
" Give it me," she said, holding
out her hand, "and I shall not have
to guess!!"  He handed it her; she
broke the seal and read:-
"DEAREST INA, - I know you will
rejoice in my new happiness. I have
a little boy ; he is just as lovely as he
can be.   Marcello tells ine yours is
prettier, bit he has no taste, and
besides mine is a creature yet of
promise, yours of fulfilment. Ah, Ina,
I never knew before what it was to
be happy, but I hold my little dar-
ling in my arms, I look into his eyes,
and I think that God is good and
very merciful. I only pray to be
worthy of all my blessings. Do you
not think you could ever make up
your mind to come and see me; to
bring all your little family,-Sofi,
Sardo, and, last of all, baby ? We live
so quietly, we never see a soul. Miro
and I are satisfied thus ; We are in
the midst of the trees and flowers,
our garden is our theatre, and every
evening 'about twilight we go there
to see the new little actors and fairy
actresses. that have risen on the
scene. If you do not come, dear Inia,

INA.

I shall have to threaten you with
Miro, baby, nurse, and myself. Would
you have room for us all ? This
letter I shall send you by the con-
stant, but unrewarded knight, who
will hand it you. Do you not think it
is just as well to give a little happi-
ness in this world if we can ?  Fare-
well!
" With a kiss from baby, yours,
"CAMILLA."
.Ina blushed as she folded the let-
ter, the, tears sprang to her eyes, but
a smile played around her lips.
"I am so glad that she is happy.
You saw her then ? "
"Yes, and I never- dreamed that
she could look so beautiful; none of
her dazzling jewels ever lent such a

133

grace to her as that look of mother-
hood: does. She goes about, they tell
me, doing good to everybody ; she
visits the poor, watches with the sick,
and is beloved by every one."
" She is an angel," said Ina.
"She is, and I know but one other
who can compare with her; she visits
the poor too, and watches with -the
weary, but she, whilst she sheds
warmth and comfort wherever she
goes, will not let one ray brighten her
own path ; she is charitable to all
but to herself, and she condemns one
who loves her better than life to
live alone and sad, when she could
open a heaven on earth to him."
Ina's head sank upon his shoulder,
as he drew her to him, and she Ihis-
pered, "Marcello, I love you!"
