IT will perhaps be complained that in this book the author "aims at nothing." If so, let me reply, in his behalf, that if he hits it he will be perfectly satisfied. Originally, I intended to address myself'only to the half-edu- cated idiots of the land who -are unfamiliar with the Coptic and ' do not take dictionaries with them into the country by way of light summer reading, But if the learned are attracted to my net, so much the better--all is fish.. In the outset I own to an endeavor to catch a spark of St. Elmo's fire--there's nothing mean about me. , As old Thomas Fuller quaintly puts it, "Let-my candle go out in a stink when I refuse to confess from whom I have lighted it." If it be further urged that, not content with a spark, I have in some instances raked the entire hearth, I fear I "must still plead guilty to the charge. For where it Vwas impos. sible to pile on the agony and erudition, I took whole pages, as well as paragraphs, from the original, dispensing with quotation remarks. If it be complained that, in consequence, the reader can not tell where the original ends and the travesty begins, cer- tainly a higher compliment, or a more complete justification of purpose, could not fall to my lot. C. H. W.   ORn THE CUNEIFORM CYCLOPEDIST OF CHATTANOOGA. CHAPTER I. T. TWEL'MO was an extraordinary cha- racter, living under the shadow of Look- r out Mountain. Whether he lived there because of the blind fumbling of Atheistic Chance, or in accordance with a rigid edict of Pantheistic Necessity, will never be known to any one; but it is quite likely that necessity had-something to do with it, since it is otherwise impossible to understand why a man should live so far from civilization-and so near Chattanooga!, Eccentricities may have compelled him to seek this retirement, for it is quite certain that a man of his manners would have been tolerated in no respectable society; and: had he attempted to pitch his tent further north, the catholic chances   8        ST.. TWE'MO. : are that he would have been speedily committed to an asylum for the insane. Southern gentlemen generally are given to stock- raising; but under the shadow of Lookout Moun- tain St. Twel'mo gathered about him some of the most extraordinary horned cattle that ever were  seen in a farm-yard. Instead of dun cows from Durham, he imported a white cow from Ava, utterly regardless of expense and the remon- strance of the negress dairy-maid (the beast had no milk-giving medium) that she should much prefer ( an udder kine." Then   there were reindleer from   Lapland t walruses  from the cold Arctic seas, goats from Cashmere,(which were meregoats after all,) cha- Dohig the Pastoral. .  - mois from  the Jungfrau, gorillas and guerrillas from Central Africa and Missouri, and pelicans from Louis- ana. These, with the polecat, native to the State, furnished him fragrant food" for reflection and employment of his leisure hours. Swearing and stirring up the animals were the only amusements in which he indulged, quoting poetry and rude-   ST. WEL'O.         9- ness to his mother constituting the serious busi- ness of his life. He was accustomed to speak of his manage; but the uneducated whites of the district under- stood the term only as an abbreviation of "me- nagerie." It is little wonder that they roundly swore, in the vernacular of that region, that St. Twel'mo had "the dog-gonedest and the ding- stavingest and the rip-snortingest queerest cattle that ever one sot eyes on!" For all his cattle, however, and his fifteen acres of pasture, St. TwePl'mo could not be called a "gentleman-farmer." For, besides swearing at his mother, he had a habit of yelling ha! ha! at young ladies and lighting cheap cigars in their presence, without asking them if they " objected to smoking," practices in which gentlemen, whether farmers or not, never indulge. But I am managing my story very inartisti- cally. Let me introduce the heroine. Etna Early was another singular character; and I may as well remark, right here, that Look- out Mountain must be continually in labor with queer characters as well as with queer cattle, for  certainly it. brings forth nothing else, if, cotempo- rary history may be relied on. At the hour and ,ninute at which our story opens, Etna was carrying a pail of water upon   10       ST. lTWEL'MO. S  y -her head, which will fully account ^^ ^XI for the "classic Caryatides" atti- 1 tudes for which she afterward be- came famous, as well as for the symptoms of "water on the brain" which she-exhibited at times in the course of her subsequent bril- liant career. And while she car- ried she sang, waking the echoes The Pursuit of Enowr Of Lookout with the chaunt of A ledge under Difficulties O 1 -and a Buclket. Bucket. Etna's occupation at the moment of introduc- tion was fortunate; it enabled her to turn pail and throw cold water upon a duel over which she happened to stumble, too late to prevent a fatal consummation to one of the parties, and not early enough, unfortunately, to insure the drowning of both. However, she was quite in time to deliver a lecture on the sinfulness of dueling, to which, -as might have been expected, only the dead man turned an ear, neither of the seconds having a minute to spare, and the sur- viving principal having another engagement on hand. The next, and perhaps a more important epoch in Etna's life, was her discovery of a dictionary, though how such a thing got under the shadow of Lookout Mountain only the Lord and the col- porteurs know. This was worse than the duel;   ST. TWEL'MO.       " it proved, in fact, a triple calamity, for she ac- quired in consequence a fatal fondness for poly- syllables, a trick of speaking them trippingly, and a contempt for common English, from which sne never recovered. CHAPTER II. HAD forgotten to mention that Eina had a a grandfather, Aaron Hunt, a, black- smith, a useful, and withal a rather sen- sible man; reasons enough, and too many, why he should be dismissed from the story and buried under the shadow of Lookout Mountain at the earliest possible moment. On this occasion Etna, accompanied by her dog "Grip," (his name was Agrippa-and so was he, as many a school-boy could testify to his sor- row,) was skipping along the path that led to the shop. On the way she encountered a solitary horseman, who asked her if there was a black- smith in the vicinity-his horse had lost a shoe. With that keen eye to business which every- where forms an element of the feminine charac- ter, Etna replied that her grandfather was in the/ "profession," and was counted the best "thar- about," pointing the stranger so plainly to the   *t   -   ,  - .-t2      8 - . xST. TIVEL'MO. *  A., *   , '/.  shop: that he could only willfully blunder upon the forge of a-rival. Arrived at the smithy, she found the stranger already there, a natural result of his being on horseback and heron foot. Not at all regardful of the fact 'that work was on the anvil, and that the stranger-was waiting, she seated herself on a  keg of nails and asked her grandfather whether he thought Jupiter treated Juno exactly right in the matter of 10 ; for she had not yet encountered a full-grown classical dictionary, and scarcely knew I1 even by sight. Her mistake in this in- stance may, perhaps, be- set down to a Ten-ne$- see education. With that ingenuousness and inattention to business for which old age is sometimes remarka- ble, Aaron dropped the horse's hoof from his lap and proceeded to discuss the mythology in all its -earings and interpretations.  -The strager waxed as wroth with this Aaron, under the shadow of Lookout Mountain, as did Moses with the old-time Aaron under the shadow of Sinai; and scowled and stamped and clamored to have his horse shod. But it was impossible to quench Etna when eruptive with erudition, and still the lava of learning flowed from the " cra- tur's" mouth. "Dog-gone Jupiter and Io! How much do I owe you-a" shouted' the stranger at last, flinging a gold dollar down in the tall grass and gallop- ing away with his fingers in his ears.   ST. lTWELWM:O. .    13 "He is a rude, blasphemous wicked* man,' '- said Aaron Hunt, after hunting for the -coinr an hour or two without finding it. "I ddn'tcare for the dollar," he added, ash he returned his spec- tacles to his pocket and lit his pipei at. the forge, "bult I would mainly like to. know where the darned thing got to."  .  Etna continued the search. It was- vai so far as finding the money was concerned; -but judge of her surprise and delight when she found, on the stranger's late stamping-ground, an Una- bridged --Webster's Dictionary, a complete set of the Cyclopedia Britannica, Piper's Opera- tive Surgery, and a Dictionary of Familiar Quo- tations. On the fly-leaf of one-of the volumes was-printed "12mo," and on that of the "Una- bridged," Lasciate ogni speranzi voi chentrate. TuLrning to the book of quotations, she found that the phrase was translated, "Tho enters here leaves Hope behind." Seating herself on the grass, she, committed to memory all the big words of the Dictionary and half the contents of the Cyclopedia, before sun- down. Returning home, she found her grand- father peacefully smoking a pipe at his cottage door.  "Welcome, my child,'? said he, " come, tell me how you have amused yourself this bright, beau- tiful afternoon."          ^ "Aged grandsire," replied the child, "'to plunge -       v    "     '   T.

And when chirur- geons who have passed beyond the stormy esoph- agus of science and gained the smooth Bahr-Shei- tan beyond (here "Grip" barked) differ by so much as a dodecatemorion, who shall decide? You may, par exemple, imagine that, because I am a woman, I have' no right to express an opinion thus freely and con amore; but, is woman merely an adscriptus glebce chameleon-like-but here I will explain that the old theory about the chame- leon taking its hue from-- "O grandy! what's the matter as For she now noticed that the old man's head reclined-peacefully on his breast. Alas! as Etna expressed it in her diary, Aaron Hunt had " passed to everlasting repose." As a gambling friend of the family told it at the tavern that evening, somewhat more tersely, he had "passed in his chips." To put it in plain English, he was dead. The appogiatura staggered him some, but the dode- catemorion knocked him cold as a wedge. Quite satisfied with the result of her first ex- periment, Etna packed her dictionaries and cy- clopedias and her dog "Grip," and started by the next train from Chattanooga.

There was a smash and a crash ot silver cords and golden bowls, and china soup tureens, and other crockery, a blind fumbling to save tile pieces, cherry beams and butternut timbers drop- ped down on the astonished passengers, and Etna was rudely snatched from the banks of Bahr- Sheitan, whereon she basked in a delicious dream, to find herself buried under dead bodies anld dic- tionaries and car wheels and cord wood which had fallen on her in the general wreck and ruin.

Spying Etna, standing on her head with her feet sticking out of the rubbish, he inquired, with a polite bow, if lhe could do anything for her. She said yes; that sundry impedimenta excoriated her cuticle and that it was impossible for her to recalcitrate. He understood the trouble at once, and replied, "Certainly, with pleasure," swinging his - lantern three times round his head-a signal which all the world over is understood to mean "down brakes." Men came rushing from all sides, and after two hours' dry digging d a grec, 6y two stout Irishmen with shovels, Etna was-excavated, She had sustained some slight injuries--a disloa cated shoulder, broken ankles, and a few shat- tered tibia-but not enough to prevent her froi entering into cheerful conversation with the sur geon, discussing cartilaginous capsules, provi sional calli, and reparation of fractures in a fash- ion which astonished, if it did not enlighten that worthy man. Having exhausted her subjects and the sur- geon, first she inquired for her dictionary, and then for her dog e The dictionary, somewhat scraped and dusty, but otherwise quite uninjured, was placed in her hands. Clasping it to her heart, she expressed a desire that it- should be buried with her in event of her injuries terminating fatally; its presence, N   18       S soT. TWPL'MO. she said, was necessary to her "everlasting re pose." On being told that her dog was dead, she mani- fested much emotion and wept bitterly. It was plain to the most casual observer that the poor girl had lost her Grip. Indeed it was a terrible scene, waterfalls, lunch- baskets, bird-cages, and hoop-skirts were piled up on all sides in- the most promiscuous confu- sion. A. middle-dressed, elegantly-aged lady, who was fumbling around in the debris for her false teeth, found Etna. She had previously overheard her conversation with the surgeon. "Bless my soul!" cried she, "here is a girl of twelve talking like a long-bearded rabbi; here is another curiosity for the bear-garden." And she whisked Etna away to her chateau, known there- about as Le Beaucage, whch lay conveniently near. The lady was St. Twel'mo's mother, and her name was Murray. Withfhe proud independence of a noble na- ture, Etna refused to accept the home which was offered her, unless permitted to "pay for it." This Mrs. Murray would not allow--one reason of her refusing to "take any thing" being that the orphan had nothing to give. She agreed to TI charge it," however, which, in some degree, sat- isfied Etna's scrples, and reconciled her to be- coming a permRanent fixture of Le Beaucage.   " 9 ST. TELV'MO.      19 CHAPTER IV. TNA'S first introduction to St. Twel'mo happened in this wise: She was seated in her bed-room one morning in earnest conversation with Mrs. Mur- ray. The discourse was about board, lodgings, and music-lessons ; and Etna having pledged her word to pay nothing for any thing until she had something to pay with, Mrs., Murray was delight- ed, and embraced her sur I'cil gauche in a very fervent fashion. Suddenly the door open-  ed, and a "gentleman"  * strode into the room, car- B  rying a bag of game. At '  sight of Etna, he stopped,     j Adropped his dead ducks fiX  and snipe on the floor, and  shouted:: "What the devil does this -mean?" 'j .a Had Etna then possessed  j    I  that coolness and savoir  w  .fl/' faire which she acquired j A    / later in life, she might have ^i^ ) J Tk replied to the, rude conun- ^yten,' drum by propounding one Returning from the Chase.   r C 0 2        S .

Pointing to the mess on the floor, she jnight have asked: "Is that your Little Game F But it is recorded of her on this occasion that she spoke not a single syllable. Indeed, she was never much given to single syllables, rarely, at any period of her career, troubling her lips with a -.word of less than five. Mrs. Murray having explained that the young lady was one of the sufferers by the late disaster, picked up the game-bag, and taking her son af- fectionately by the arm, led hiln from the room, without giving him a chance to apologize for his rudeness.  Had he been led out by the nose, he would have had no more than ;his desert, and scarcely that; but mark you how Etna was affected. A thrill shot along her nerves; she felt a blind fumbling at her heart-strings; a presentiment overwhelmed her; the Pantheistic Necessity that she should marry the rude intruder became evi- dent and apparent-in himn she recognized the coming man. The coming man-that is, the one who had just gone out-was tall and athletic, not exactly young and not precisely elderly; it would be safe to set him down as middle-aged. According to all accoants, he must have been a rather rum- looking customer; for his fair chiseled linea- ments were blotted by dissipation and blackened    ST. 1WEL'MO.        21 and distorted by the baleful fires of a fierce, pas- sionate nature, and a restless, powerful, and un- hallowed intellect. Furthermore, he was sym- metrical and grand As some temple of Juno, Whose polished shafts Gleamed centuries ago, In the morning sunsine Of a day of wo, (this thing resolves itself into rhyme,) whose un- timely night has endured for nineteen hundred years; so in the glorious flush of his youth this man had stood facing a noble and possibly sanctified future, (and things;) but the ungov- ernable flames of sin had reduced him, like that blackened and desecrated fane, to a melan- choly mass of ashy arches and blackened, col- ' umns, where ministering priests,all holy aspira- tions, slumbered in the dust. The dress of this melancholy mass of ashy arches and blackened columns was costly but negligent, and the red stain on his jacket told that his errand had' not been fruitless, (from which it might be inferred that he'had been strawherrying as well as ducking.) As part of this costly but negligent dress, the melancholy mass wore a straw hat belted with broad black ribbons, and his spurred boots (hunters down there always put spurs on when they chase the wild'duck and the fierce snipe to their Lookout Mountain fastnesses) were damp and muddy.   22       ST. TWEjL'MO. It seems rather melancholy, at first glance, that this melancholy mass of mud and minister- ing priests, and arches and columns, and spurs and straw hats, and broad black ribbons, should demean itself in the way he did, striding into a young-lady's bed-chamber, dumping dead ducks on the carpet, braying out Ha! ha! like Mephis- topheles in the play or a jackass in a corn- . field, and asking, "What the devil does this meanT  of its own mother. Indeed, nothing but a--blackened colnumn or a negro minstrel could do such things without a'blush. Something in the column's tones-I almost said the column's base-recalled to Etna's memory the rude, wicked, blasphemous man who said, "Dog-gone it!" to her grandfather, and left dic- tionaries and cyclopedias lying around loose on the grass before the shop. She could hear him in the next room, talking to his mother. He called her "mna mre" (per- haps the least objectionable way in which he could dam her) and Etna an acolyte, prophe- sying that some day the latter would turn up non est. ditto silver forks, ditto diamonds, ditto gold spoons. Etna all'. this while felt the indignant blood burning her'cheeks; but 'having plenty of cheek and to spare, she simply let it burn on, and sat and heard the conversation through. At the doubts expressed of her honesty, she started; w  ^ r    b   ST. TWEL'MO.       23  for she remembered the dictionaries and cyclope- dias of the smithy, for which she had never en- deavored to find an owner, and she wondered whether St. Twel'mo remembered them too. Feeling rather apprehensive that he might re- cognize them if they fell in his way, she deter- mined to return them in the morning. But in the morning an unforeseen accident oc- curred. Going out on the lawn, to play with the elephants, and rhinoceroses, and pelicans, a huge dog came tearing along, and after biting off an elephant's ear, and strangling a rhinoceros or two, turned on Etna. Faint with terror, she was incapable of lifting a hand in her defense, and even forgot to quote- the first time in life that she ever missed an op- portunity. It galled her afterward to. think how patly she could have put in the lines of Dr. Watts, beginning "Let dogs delight to bark and bite;" but the circumstances were not favorable for classic indulgences. Of course St. Twel'mlo came on opportunely and called off his dog. He did more, he picked up a club and belabored the dog, which howled, and St. Twel'mo,howled, and the rhinoceros bel- lowed, while Etna, fully restored to a sense of her mission in life, mounted a stump and chanted the prayer of Habakkuk in the original Hebrew,   24       ST TWEL'MO. so that altogether they had a very effective quar- tet and quite a lively and interesting time of it. And after it was all over, and St. Twel'mo had done licking the dcog, the dog, probably thinking that one good turn deserved another, turned'and licked his master's feet, which gave St. Twel'mo an opportunity to cry Ha! and remarkl that that was the way of all natures, human as well as brute. MEM. The behavior of the dog in theR finale of this matter leads me to the inevitable conclusion that it was a female dog. I mean no disrespect to the sex by the preced- ing annotation; I simply mean that such would ,  be the logical deduction did we accept the hero- ines of* most women's novels as types of woman- hood at large. For here is St. Twel'mo, whose face was blotted by dissipation, and blackened and distorted by baleful fires, and who looked like a melancholy mass of ashy arches and black- ened columins, and who was always damning his mother and his sweethearts, and crying ha! to them, and saying par parenthase, and par excel- lence, and par exemple, and par nobile fratruzm^, and parleu- (His French and his Latin weri seldom or never above par)-   ' Yet carrying innumerable female scalps at his belt.

For I have tried original verses, and pet names, and bouquets, and gentlemanly behavior, and the sweet influences of modest and unpre- tending merit, all in vain. The moral that women with "intellect into them," can be best won by pelting them with vituperation and junk-bottles instead of with bon-bons, and telling them to go to the devil in- stead of to Delmonico's, where any thing they choose to fancy in the way of lunch awaits them, I do not believe, and do here resolutely refuse to accept, though all the authoresses in Christendom and out of it are leagued together to persuade me to the contrary; after which personal explanation I resume the thread of my story. , {-* CH APTER V. E same levening Etna'determined to call A, at St. Twel'mo's apartments-notwith- standing the injunction from all about the house that she must never cross the threshold of his room-and return the dictionaries and cy- clopedias. As already remarked, it was the evening of the day on which the encounter with the dog oc- curred. By some strange fumbling or thimrble-   26       ST. TWEL'MO. rigging of the planets, Sirius was just wagging its tail in the eastern horizon, when Etna knocked at the terrible doors. Was it an omen? Was the dogstar indeed to prove the star of her destiny? Rat! tat! tat! Etna executed the long roll which a woman beats,.echoing her heart-taps, when in doubt as to the, propriety of a step, but has already de- ternimned to "go in," cost what it may. 1i  'L Come in " The voice was gruff as that of the wolf in reply to Red Riding Hood's tattoo. She opened the door and waited for a second invitation. If came. "Come in, damn you!" growled the inmate, blowing the smoke of a very bad cigar, which smelt like brimstone, in scattered spirals to the vaulted and fluted ceiling. On this she entered. St. Twel'mo did not rise, and the tableau was a peculiar one. There sat our hero, gaunt and peculiar. The peculiarity of the gaunt look which enveloped Mm, as with a mantle, is readily enough explained when we consider "that for nearly fifteen dreary years, nothing but jeers, and oaths, and sarcasms, had crossed his finely sculptured lips." It is little wonder that on such diet he had not fleshed up much; but it is indeed singular that some of the oaths and things had not strangled him.   ST.. TWEL'MO.      27 The reflection occurs that he must at times have felt thirsty; but perhaps, like the lover mentioned in the lyric, he drank only with his eyes. A hy- pothesis which is strengthened by the fact that it was out from his glowing gray eyes that the mock- ing demon of the wine-cap looked. But to resume. On his swarthy and colorless face, midnight orgies and habitual excesses had left their unmistakable plague spot, and Mephisto- pheles had stamped his signet. Is it any wonder that Etna's love fed as she gazed and that, lost in contemplation of the pleasant picture, and pos- sibly bright future before her, she wholly forgot the errand which brought her thither a "What the devil. does this mean, and what do you want?" growled St. Twel'mo.  "Squattez vous 1a," and he pointed to a chair. "No, I thank you," replied Etna with a grace- ful courtesy, "I only come to return some books I borrowed of you." And turning to a black servant who stood be- hind her with a hand-cart, she bade him wheel it in. E-e obeyed, and she rapidly began to unload it of dictionaries and cyclopedias. With a sudden expression of interest in his countenance, the mas- ter of the apartment rose from his gracefully re, cumbent position and approached her. "In the name of the Great Horned Drome- dary of Eblis, whose hump, bright with the glit-   28       ST.

"Is it possible my dear Unabridged! the very copythat has traveled round the world in my vest pocket, and without which I was lost. Can it be? Tell me, girl, where did you get it " She explained the circumstances as well as she could. But lost in rapture as he rapidly turned over'- its well-thumbed pages, he paid no heed to her words.*  Suddenly his brow darkened, his eye flashed, and' his nostrils dilated, as, turning to her in a voice of thunder, he roared: "Damnation! you have stolen all the bigwords out of it! Bithus contra Bacchiumm! Get out of this " -Sorrowfully thinking what a pity it was that such a noble intellect, and such an ornament of society should be lost tothe world, Etna turned and left the apartment.   ST. TWEL'MO.       29 4, As she turned a corner in the corridor, St. Twel'nmo, with a Dutch oathl, which unfortunate- ly she could not understand, hurled the diction- ary at her; missing her fragile form, it struck a plaster bust of Lord Chesterfield which stood in range, inflicting several compound fractures which no plaster could mend. The back of the book was also bust. Cyclopedias and yellow-covered novels came hurtling after. .Safe in the sanctuary of a convenient closet, Etna dropped upon her knees and softly murmured, "Who smote the marble gods of. Greece 2" St. Twel'mo howling his favorite slogans, Bi- thus contra Bacchium, and Chacun d son gou't, rushed into his solitary apartments, slammed the doors behind him, and spent the rest of the night in horrible dissipation over a small Jenklins's Vest Pocket Dictionary, but it consoled him not for the loss of his Unabridged. c, SCHAlPTER     VI. TNA' S curiosity was awakened by the glimpse she had obtained of bachelor quarters, and she determined to explore them at her leisure, immediately an opportunity offered. She had not long to wait. The next day St.    30       ST. TWEL'MO. o Twel'mo mounted his horse and galloped over to Chattanooga to purchase a spelling-book, for which he had need in writing a business letter to a greasy mechanic who had agreed to construct a hydraulic ram on the premises for the benefit of the Mering sheep, and Cashmere goats-the poor creatures suffered sadly from want of an ade- quate supply of water. No sooner had the echoing tramp of his horse' s hoofs died away in the distance, than Etna in- stalled herself in the vacant rooms, and made herself perfectly at home. Indeed St. Twel'mo's apartments were curi- ously furnished. In lieu of sofas, and ottomans, and Turkish chairs, and meerschaums, and spit- toons, and photograph albums, and cqal-scuttles, and handsomely bound copies of Tiffith Lank, and The Jumping Frog, and boxing-gloves, and foils, and cheese-toasters, and tailors' ills, and old boots, and embroidered slippers, and dressing - gowns, and cigar - stumps, and soda water, and empty bottles, and portraits - of pop- ular actresses, and other things that men's rooms are generally full of, she found only old vases and antique jars-family jars-of no pos- sible use, not even to "sit down" on; and ca- meos, and cameras, and intaglios, and entangle- ments, and prospectuses of new gas companies for supplyingthe pyramids with cheap light, and Turcoman cimetars-crooked as rams' horns-   SC T WEDMO.       31 Bedouin lances, Bowie knives, flint-lock muskets, and other queer weapons which afterward con- tributed so largely to the armament of the Con- federate forces. Beside, there was an-astonishing pile of cyclopedias, dictionaries, languages with- out masters and masters without languages, a volume entitled A Thousand Things Worth -Knowing, and a whole library which might have been labelled, Ten Thousand Things not Worth Knowing! More things, in fact, were in these bachelor quarters-he never did things by halves -than Horatio or even the fanciful Philes ever dreamed of in their Phileosophies. But what. most attracted Etna's attention was one of those mysterious contrivances known as a "Herring's Safe," whether because a herring in them is safe from roasting or sure to be done to a turn, no philologist has yet proclaimed. It was modeled after a miracle of Saracenic architecture, and had a lock which defied gunpowder, and ex- temporized keys made of crooked nails; the door was painted to resemble live oak, but the inscrip- tion' thereon was written in a dead language. Etha would have liked to know what the thing contained, but the combination-lock refused to respond to the pass-keys she carried about her, and all her blind fumbling at the mystic key-hole proved of -no avail. She sighed and wished that her grandfather was around with his sledge-hammer.   32       ST. TWEL'MO. As she turned away and retraced her steps among the costly bizarrerie, it suddenly occurred to her that no light childish feet had ever pattered down the long rows of shining tiles, and she sud- denly thought, "What a pity, oh! if " (Why do such things always occur to women when men never think of them 2) And then, with a sorrowful sigh, she sought her own apartment. Her dreams that night were of wedding favors-sometimes written "fevers" by the illiterate-and the altar assumed the shape of a burglar and fire-proof safe. Pressing her lips closely to the open end of the bolster, under the natural but mistaken impres- sion that it was the happy bridegroom's ear, she whispered softly, "Ducky, deary, wzhat on earth do you keep in that big iron bandbox " CHAPTER Vll. the days wore on at Le Beaucage-and that every thing did not wear out was very strange indeed. And Etna progress- ed in knowledge. ^In company with a fine and erudite old clergyman, named Gammon, she com- mitted to memory nearly all the books which no gentleman's library should be without, all the   ST. TWEL'MO.       -33 quotable passages in Diodorus, Tupper/ Owen Meredith, Mark Twain, Plutarch, John Ruskin, Charles Algernon Swinburne, Thucydides, and 'Walt Whitman. For she had made up her mind to go forth and face the world-outface it, if ne- cessary. The only subject on which there was not full sympathy and perfect communion between Etna and the Rev. Mr. Gammon was that mauvais sujet, St. Twel'mo. Etna feared that her tutor did not love her hero, and one day asked him how? and if not, wherefore-? The reverend gentle- man clasped his hands and declared that he loved St. Twel'mo as well as his own life, if not better. At first Etna would not believe this declaration, but when she learned that St. Twel'nmo had mur- dered a couple of the clergyman's children, she gave it implicit credence. For she herself had not been entreated over and above well at his  hands,- and the seething of love in her own heart in consequence convinced her that some pork  would boil so-pardon the homeliness of the pro- verb. If I have until nowforgotten to mention one pe- culiarity about St. Twel'mo, let me at once reme- dy the omission. - He was wonderfully fond of travel, the result, perhaps, of his pedigree. For his father, also named - Murray, was none other than the illustrious author of those guide books, so familiar and famous all Europe through. The *    Y4 .      ST. TWEJL'MO. mistaken impression which obtained on some sides, that he was descended from Lindley Mur- ray, St. Twel'mo denounced with disdain, proud- ly boasting that there was never a grammarian in the family-a fact too patent to be gainsaid by any. Impatient of home and never at rest, his foot- steps had- sounded among the steppes of Tartary; Arabs on the great desert were acquainted with his war-cry of Bithus contra Bacchium; Fejee chieftains, while breakfasting on underdone mis- sionary, had been made familiar with his favorite apophtheglm, Chacun d son got. As an ex- plorer of equatorial Africa, he divided the honors with Du Chaillu, and was certainly entitled to the odd trick, for it could not be denied that he brought home with him more of the habits and n manners of the gorillas than Du Chaillu did. In short, there was only one spot on the face of the earth which he had not visited-that was the State of New-Jersey. And one morning, at the breakfast table, he announced to his mother his intention of making a, journey thither. With a wild shriek, she dropped the tea-pot from her hand, and was carried away from the table upon the tray. Without minding the old lady at all, he strode out to the stable, ordered his horse saddled and some pork and hominy packed up, and galloped away. *. * -*   ST. TWEL'MO.'-      35 After galloping as far as the gate, he paused, turned, and beckoned to Etna. She approached him. Drawing a huge key from his pocket, he told her that it belonged to the big safe-he called it Taj Mahaal, which is butch for Red Herring-informed her that the safe contained papers of no value to any one but the owner, and of very little to him, and that he intended to - intrust the key to her care. But he forbade her opening it unless he was four years absent, in which event she might conclude that he had been elected governor and would never more return. Etna pertinently remarked that if she was neM allowed to use the safe to keep her chignon, and hair-pins, and pearl-powder in, she didn't see what use there was in leaving her the key; but finally consented to accept the trust, sagely say- ing to herself that very possibly it might turn to some account. He plunged spurs in his horse and was gone. Etna at once returned to the house and ex- amined the safe. A small spider had crawled into the keyhole, and thinking he might injure the lock, she put in the key and turned it gently, to drive him out. She was afraid that the door might accidentally open; but no-the bolt was rusty and refused to stir; for fifteen years it had known no other assuagement of friction than oaths, and jeers, and sarcasms-in which respect it resembled St. TwelPmo's lips. *             ,    -36 b   X   ST. TWEL'MO. After turning for an hour or two, she finally turned away, and buried herself in a reprint of the Bhagvat-Geeta, just republished by philes. The Targum  had hitherto been her pabulum during solitary moments, but she: had chewed upon it so long that she desired a change. Suddenly she was recalled from the delicious dialogues of Kreeshna and Arjoon by a mellow voice under the window, singing: "I will chase the elephant over the plain, The rhinoceros I'll bind with a chain, And the hippopotamus, with his silvery feet, I'll give thee for a playmate sweet." Approaching the window, she recognized Gordon Lee, a distant relative of the general of that name who was lately presented with a pair of game- cocks. He addressed her a few words in Greek, to which she coyly replied in Coptic. After this cheerful interchange of greetings, she went down and sat with him in the bear-garden in front of the house. They talked of megatheriums, acephala, mastodons, cubic roots, rhomboids, and cognate ideas that the youthful imagination generally runs riot with of moonlight evenings. Gordon was a handsome young fellow, well born, well educated, and of good connections- though he missed some of them when the gun- boats were reported as steaming down the river. Courteous to his equals and kind to his inferiors, he was a general favorite in Chattanooga. Etna   Sr. T"WEL'MO. .37 anld he had studied the Sanskrit together, sitting at the feet of Gamaliel Gammon, (who, like many others of the cloth, was familiar with most lan- guages except English,) and latterly they had been deep in a translation of the Manavad- harmasastra, each trying to distance the other, but so far it had been a tie between them. Now the tie was all on Gordon's side, and so difficult a one was it to undo that it might be called a Gordian knot. He was in love with Etna, and had wooed her in Chinese, Cufic, Hebrew, and Massachusetts French, but without effect. Un- fortunately for the success of his suit, he was not scorched by baleful fires, nor blotted by dissipa- tion, and didn't look like a ruined temple, nor a dilapidated tar-kiln, nor a melancholy mass of ashy arches, and charcoal pits, and whisky cock- tails.  Besides, he was neat in his dress and respectful to his mother, and didn't quote and swear. Had he ever seduced a woman, or shot a man, or even robbed a contribution-box, there might have been some chance for him; but as it was, his case was hopeless. This evening the moon was mellow and so was Gordon ; for the one had- filled her horns and the other had emptied his. Under these conditions and combinations he had more courage thuan usual, and  skillfully turned the conversation upon trilobites - though musquito bites would haste been more apropos to the season-as a neat way of approaching the subject which was near   ; 38 -- -   ST. TWEL'MO. est his heart. He had found one of rare beauty during the day, and begged her acceptance of it; but she declined on the plea that there was no vacancy in her cabinet. He then besought her acceptance of a ring, taking a California diamond of fabulous value-wholly fabulous-from his pocket. "It is beautiful in this light," he said, holding it up to the stars, i' how it glistens ; do you see it?i "Alas! no, not in those lamps,'" she replied, and though she finally consented to accept the ring, she gave him definitely to understand that he was out of it. On returning to the house Etna looked as though she had been doing something foolish, and Mrs. Murray divined the truth. "How could you V" she cried. "A young man of excel- lent principles, sound religious convictions, five ' hundred niggers, not counting piccaninnies, and raising rather more than a bale to the acre! Howt could you be so foolish, and so cruel?2" "Alas! mammna," sobbed Etna, hiding her face on Mrs. Murray's bosom, "he mispronounced a Greek quantity." And Mrs. Murray, who knew how sensitive the. child was on such points, but did not dream that at deeper reason u derlay the refusal, forgave at once, and comforted her with the hope that one - of the Harvard professors might yet happen that way, and then she could have a husband to her liking.   ST. TWEL'MO.      39 CHAPTER VIII. FTER    learning that Gordon Lee was spoony on her, it became manifestly s necessary that they should no longer study together. Geometry must specially be given up as tending to excite the blood; and there was no telling even what trouble might be He- brewing if they met upon the plains of that prim- itive language. Suddenly a brilliant idea occurred to Etna. She would be an authoress. She would elevate her sex, she would write essays, poetry, tales, novels. There were no bounds to her ambition. Clasping her hands-in default of any one else's a woman is apt to clasp her own-she cried, "To what may I not in time aspire?  Even Godey's Lady's Book is not beyond my reach!" Down there the ladies add a syllable to the favorite oath of the sterner sex, and swear by Godey. It is so easy to understand, and has so many pretty pictures. "Yes," mused Etna, "the true end and aim of woman's life should be to write a novel." And immediately she seated herself at her escritoire, and wrote to all the editors in New-York, Boston, and Philadelphia, inclosing to each a few hun-   40       ST. TWEL'MO. dred pages of fis., and requesting an insertion in their next numbers. Pending replies, St. Twel'mo came home. The first question he asked-before even swear- ing at his mother-was of Etna. - Have you opened the Taj Mahal " "No,'" she replied. Of course he intimated with his usual courtesy that she lied, and dragged her off to the library. She stood trembling while he fumbled at the keyhole.- "I know you have opened the door," he exclaimed; "but we shall see."  Another spider had been at work; withone sweep of his powerful arm he scattered the web to the winds. "If you have not opened it, there will be an ex- plosion," he said. It -occurred to her that there would also be an explosion if she had; but she stood her ground with the calmness befitting one who aspired to periodicals, and was not afraid of magazines. He swung the door open and a columbiad was discharged, belching forth its fire and smoke into the room, hoisting St. Twel'mo and Etna to the ceiling, to the dislocation of the latter's waterfall, and so startling her that, for the second time in life, she quaailed instead of quoting. St. Twel'mo was so surprised to find that the door had not been opened in his absence to the ignition of his infernal machine, and that Etna , \\    ST. TWEL'MO.       41 "II  E  N Cj J Safe bind, safe find. was alive, and he was alive, and there was noth- ing dead in the room but a few languages, that he pulled from his finger a ring, engrossed with a Chaldaic character, and insisted upon her accept- ance of it. Etna's eyes glistened as she gazed upon the jewel and recognized the talismanic sign it bore. But other visions unfolded themselves to her: Beyond blazed the torch,   42       ST. TWEL'MO. : 0 that gn7is fatuus which has led so many up the steep and winding stairs of the great white fane in Franklin Square, to find no rest for their feet, nor acceptance of their handiwork when their story reached that third story, known as the Aisle of Guernsey. And over a distant frog-pond stood the nebulous familiar to allwho have sought the Philosopher's Tone, and hateful to those who have found it not. And she determined not to be in a hurry about accepting any thing. With an angry hand he dashed the i      ST. TWEL'MO.       43 into the grate. "Thle badge of my race," he said; "it will be quite at home among the con- genial flames-there at least it will be red. Many a stout Twel'mo has had the same grate circulation," and he laughed savagely. With the glare of- the grate in his face and its smoke in his hair, he looked so supernaturally ugly and so unusually wicked, that Etna's heart warmed toward him, and she hung out that light in her eyes which all the world over is accepted and recognized as the signal for a flirtation. Tlhis was seven o'clock in the evening. About nine o'clock, two hours later, the af- fair was progressing as follows-St. TwePlmo loquitur   - "Pardon me if I remind you," he said, "of the preliminary and courteous en garde! which should be pronounced before a thrust. De Guerin felt starved in Languedoc, and no wonder! But had he penetrated every nook and cranny of the habitable globe and traversed the Zaharas which science accords the universe, he would have died at last as hungry as Ugolino. I speak advisedly, for the true Io gadfly ennii has stung me from hemisphere to hemisphere, across tempestuous oceans, scorching deserts, and icy mountain ranges. I have faced alike the bourrans of the steppes and the Samieli of Shamo, and the result of my vandal life is best epitomized in those grand but grim words of Bossuet: 'On trouvee   "       ST. TWEL'MO. au fond de tout le vide et le neant.' Nineteen years ago, to satisfy my hunger, I set out to hunt the daintiest food this-world would furnish, and, like other fools, have learned finally, that life is but a huge mellow golden Osher, (short for pump- kin,) that mockingly sifts its bitter dust upon our eager lips. A h! truly, On trouve ate fond de tout le vide et le neant J" Etna promptly made answer to this sprightly little sally: "Mr. Murray, if you insist upon your bitter Osher simile, why shut your eyes to the palpable analogy suggested? Naturalists assert that the Solanum, or apple of Sodom, contains in its normal state neither dust nor ashes, unless it is punctured by an insect, (the Tenthredo,) which converts the whole of the in- side into dust, leaving nothing but the rind entire, without any loss of color. Human life is as fair and tempting as the fruit of Ain Jidy, till stung and poisoned bythe Tenthredo of sin." "Will you favor me," he replied, "by lifting on the point of your- dissecting-knife this sting- ing sin of mine to which you refer? The noxious brood swarm so teasingly about my ears that they deprive me of your cool, clear, philosophic discrimination. Which particular Tenthredo of the buzz7ing swarm around my spoiled apple of life would you advise me to select for my anath- ema maranatha?                 * (At this point the servant girl, who was dust-   ST. TWEL'MO.       45 ing the drawers with a peacock's tail, looked around; for her name was Anna Maria, and she thought she was called.) "Of your history, sir," returned Etna, "I am entirely ignorant; and even if I were not, I should not presume to levy a tax upon it in discussions with you; for however vulnerable you may pos- sibly be, I regard an argumentum ad tomzinem (here the servant girl, thinking that homniny was meant and mentioned, brightened up and put on an intelligent look) as the weakest weapon in the army of dialectics-a weapon too  " But that will do for the present. Suffice it to say that this thing went on for two hours more, and that a full report of the speeches would occupy twenty pages of foolscap, and could only be made tolerable by an accompanying jingle of as many bells. When the little coquetterie ended at time for putting out the lights, both sat asleep in their respective chairs whispering big words in each other's ears from sheer force of habit.   "     .S' TI WEL'MO. TCHAPTER IX. T. TWEL'MO was a decidedly original ,  wooer. TLike an Indian chief, the mo- ment he set out on thewar path he be- gan to recount how many scalps he had previ- ously taken. Thus, cornering Etna in a church one evening, while she was practicing, in prepa- ration for the next Sunday, upon the hand or- gan, which did duty in lieu of a larger wind instrument, he breathed a soft eonfession into her ear. Printed, I am aware that it will read very much like a page from the Newgate Calendar. It seemed that a son of the Rev. Mr. Gammon had cut him out with the daughter of anrother clergyman, by wearing higher shirt collars and indulging more lavishy in pomatums and macas- sar. A challenge passed between them, and St. Twel'mo killed his antagonist at the first fire. Thenceforth his career was a strange one, and its recital must have been edifying to Etna's ears. He seduced every " brilliant and accoim plished woman" that the village of Chattanooga and the surrounding swamps contained, "win- ning her love and then leaving her a target for the laughter of her circle"--to be blasted, as it   SAT. TWEELI'MO.      47 were, by blow-guns.  This he told his sweet- heart. ' One of the fairest faces that ever bright- ened the haunts of fashion-a queenly, elegant girl-the pet of her-family and of society," he se- duced and reduced to a melancholy mass of ashy arches and things somewhat a-kiln to himself. At the time that he told this story, she was "wearing serge garments" in an Italian convent. Serge was her life! St. Twel'mo was wearing spurred-boots the while, and telling these tales to his sweetheart. But the exploit on which he most prided him- self, the one he "' norated " with the greatest zest, assuming the half-deprecating air of those ex- cessively virtuous persons who "do good by stealth and blush to find it fame," was as fol- lows. The scene occurred at the parsonage, and I allow St. Twel'mo to tell the story in his own words: "During one terribly fatal winter, scarlet fever had deprived the Rev. Mr. Gammon of four child- ren, (St. Twel'mo and scarlet fever seem to have run in the family,) leaving him an only daughter, Annie, the image of her brother, (the brother whom he had previously taken the precaution to kill.) Her health was feeble; consumption was stretching its skeleton hands toward her, and her father watched her as a gardener tends his pet, choice, delicate exotic. She was about, sixteen, very pretty, very attractive. After her brother's   48       ST. TWEL'MO. death, I never spoke to Mr. Gammon, never cross- ed his path; but I met his daughter without his - knowledge, and finally I made her confessher love for me. I offered her my hand ; she accepted it. A day was appointed for an elopement and mar- riage; the hour came ; she left the parsonage, but I did not meet her here on the steps of this church as I had promised, and she received a note full of scorn and derision, explaining the revengeful mo- tives that had actuated me. Two hours later, her father found her insensible on the steps, (she could scarcely have been sensible when she took the step,), and the. marble was dripping with a hemorrhage of blood (alas! that it was of blood) from her lungs. The dark - stain is still there you must have noticed it. I never saw her again. She kept her room (better it must have been than St. Twel'mo's company) from that day, and died three months after. When on her death-bed she sent for me, but I refused to obey the summons. The story of our hero's loves and triumphs by no means ended here ; but sufficient for this day is the evil thereof. -Ex pede HerculemA-it is not expedient to prolong the agonies ; the devil, quite as well as Hercules, may be recognized by a sin- 9gle hoof. The only wonder is, that Etna had not married, out of hand, this chivalric Chattanoogian, who selected consumptive little gills, whom even the scarlet fever and the measles spared, for victims- k   ST. TWE'MO.       49 having first killed off their big brothers-who told over his adulteries as a monk might his beads, and as little blushed in telling them. Seducing the sister, by way of getting even with her brother, certainly commends itself as an ori- ginal enterprise, which should have stirred the depths of a refined and cultivated woman, emu- lous of elevating her kind by writing for the fashion magazines, to love and admiration. How- ever, Etna declined the honor of a betrothal. It may hae been that she was not ambitious of be- ing set up as a target, etc., or wearing serge gar- ments, etc., and early habits may have led her to object to even the remote possibility of being smothered with a pillow. At all events, she said No, though she felt in her own heart that she loved him m'ore than ever. O the feminine bosom! is it not fearfully and wonderfully made up! Even the picture of the apple-trees, where he and his "idol had chatted, and romped, and whistled in the far past," (think of that idle whistling 1) failed to move her. She did not wish to incur the risk of having a "hemorrhage of bloody and besides, ambitious of authorship, she was determined to do it or die. It was a clear case of noblesse oblige. * .   60       ST. TWElMO. CHAPTER R X. THE night mail brought her an offer of a situation as nurse in. a rich but respect- able family in New-York, and replies to her letters to the editors. The Boston Illuminati wrote that they did not think that her style would do for the Atlantic-it was scarcely salt enough; Philadelphia, speaking through Godey, replied that neither her essay on Ramayana, nor her very elaborate treatise on Comparative Anatomy was calculated to interest lady readers. They were declined with thanks -a polite editorial phrase which may always be interpreted as meaning thanks that there is -no more. The Harpers wanted practical articles that themselves and others could understand, without foot-notes, or condensations of their last published books, though they would publish ex- tracts from her more serious essays in the Edi- tor's Drawer, at the usual rates of compensation in that department. Seeing a gleam of hope here, Etna telegraphed to know what that rate was. .The reply came, ( Nothing, and pay your own postage." But there was one ray of comfort. A new magazine had been started, and its proprietors were pushing it vigorously-so vigorously that they nearly pushed it to the wall in the first year   ST. TWEL'MO.       51 of its existence. The public are not always in a milky and watery way, and sometimes crave some- thing with an edge-meat-axy, rather than any other "axy."  Hearing that the new magazine was then publishing some story by A trollop, Etna at first shrank sensitively back from such association, but finally made overtures of a glo- rious piece on favorable terms, inclosing to it an essay, "Who smote the marble brow of Billy Patterson?"In accordance with his usual custom the editor carried it home and read it to his wife, his father-in-law, his maid-servant, his man-servant, and the stranger that was with- in his gates. Not one of them being able to understand it, they unanimously voted it a de- lightful and excellent article, especially "maga- ziny," whatever that may mean;'and Etna was informed that it would appear in the next num- ber, if another was issued. The editor added that it would be paid for at the regular rate, which was $1 10 a page. At this latter clause Etna smiled a smile of love and triumph; "For," she said, "there are forty pages, and I can buy a new dictionary for my- self, of which I stand in need, and a New Tes- tament for St. Twel'mp, of which he stands in need, and also--" But her countenance fell as she went on and read that they paid nothing for quotations, which would cut her article down to something less than three pages,    52       ST. TWEL'MO. She sighed, and thought how hard it is to earn ones s living by one's pen. W^   CCHAPTER   XI. TNA went on to New-York, and assumed herdutiesas nurse. Itisrecordedof her ^ that she made a very dry nurse indeed. Two children were intrusted to her care; one a babe at the breast; the other a precocious little fellow, with a weak back, named Felix. The children made astonishing progress under her tuition. The - baby spoke an unintelligible -tongue before it was weaned, and Felix was well up in Hebrew before the first six months were ended. Felix, however, though very proud of the language, remarlked that he didn't like the prayer of Habakkuk, or, as he pronounced it, i A back ache." Her manner of instilling knowledge into the young mindwas original and peculiar to herself. She encouraged them to ask questions which no one could answer, and never lost an opportunity of telling them something that they didn't know, and ought not to. The system is known as " object teaching," I think. Thus to Felix one day, No, my dear, the young oyster does not derive nourishment in   ST. TWEL'DMO.       53 the same way that your little brother does. The young oyster has a mamma, but the maternal oyster has no mamnwfe. "That is singular," cried Felix. "No, my dear," replied Etna, "it is plural." "This is a great deprivation," she continued, "but the meek resignation with which he submits to the dispensation, the patience with which he blindly fumbles about the rocks for his food, should teach little boys a lesson." The parents of the children voted her a treasure, for she talked the children to sleep, and the pare- goric and soothing syrup account dwindled down to a merely nominal sum. In return, they allowed her to receive as many calls as she pleased, pro- vided she herself answered the bell. That her visits were not those of angels may be inferred from the number; they were neither few nor far between. Her article in the magazine had sent all the Galactophagists to their dictionaries and they could not find more than half the words there. In consequence, they came to Etna for elucidation, but she, unfortunately, had forgotten what the largest ones meant. The effect of Et- na's article was such that .the magazine in which it appeared was afterward published only once in two months instead of twice a month as at first, i which was a vast improvement and delighted the public greatly.  All this won for Eta great reputation, and finally she had an offer to write for the Ledger. *   b       A.   l4 o      ST.-TWEL)MO. Among the many who came to call, came an editor with a "granite mouth*" No, it was not Marble, nor yet the late Dr. Stone, and the reader need not indulge in con- jectures as to what editor it may be. It is quite enough to say that he wanted to marry Etna-a  fact which at once establishes him as a man of determination and daring. Etna refused him. No one could guess why, for he owned a paper of his own, and was in a fair way of obtaining a foreign mission, as his party, then in power, had long been looking for a pretext to get him out of the country. When asked the reason of her refusing so eligible an offer, Etna replied it was his granite mouth; she did not like the formation. Indeed, she had no, end of of- fers. An English lord, tall and handsome, with long side-whisk- ers. and a double-barreled eye- glass, (it was not Lord Lyons,) offered her marriage at sight. It could scarcely be called a case of second sight, on her part, for she didn't see it. She replied by reciting three chapters from the Gita-Govinda.

STIEL'MO.      5 country, unless it be as a commissioner to settle the Alabama claims. This thing must be kept up, thought Etna, and she next published a book. This made a hit- striking the publisher favorably, as he announced in a series of fantastic advertisements. Type of the most wonderful characters had to be cast express- ly for the production of this work, and the services of the Learned Blacksmith were engaged as chief proof-reader-he should be kept well up in tongs, said Etna. Fifteen cylinder presses were kept running night and day to supply the demand, and the publisher was so broken down in health by the labor of writing advertisements, answering questions and doing battle with the half-educated idiots who couldn't understand the book, that he took in a partner and sailed himself for an mnin- habited island to recuperate his shattered consti- tution. He had a good time on the island, and discovered some big things in ornithology. These are the birds. i    The Birds of Van Demon's Land. In fact, never was there seen such a time.

In England every body wanted to marry her, and the yacht club gave her a dinner. In return she offered to present Prince Alfred with a copy of her book, which he respectfully declined, say- ing that he could not think of accepting any thing so valuable. She was even importuned to lecture in Exeter Hall, paying the expenses of the build- ing herself and guaranteeing that the furniture should not be demolished by'the audience. This proposition she refused. But she consented to read an essay: in private, upon the points of simi- larity between the Christian deities and heathen gods; the essay was spoken of by those who Leard it as "a most exhaustive one "--indeed, it must have been, for nearly all who sat it through sank off to sleep. Little Felix- died. But Etna was somewhat consoled for the death of her charge by hearing of the " new: birth ' of her lover. The first dis- patch-the Atlantic cable was not working very well then- spelt it berth, and stated that St. Trwel'mo had been ordained as a circus rider. But a letter by the Cunard corrected the canard,   - ST. TWWEL'MO. and Etna learnt, to her great joy, that Circuit rider was meant, and her beloved was a minister. At first she could not believe the news, but re- turning to Chattanooga, as soon a! steam and rail could carry her, she found it confirmed. He had run through most of his property, people said, and no other profession was open to him., The war breaking out just then, Etna deter- mined that St. Twel'mo should not be at peace, and married him. She knew that the, cause of the South was pure and just, and that they had a right to forts, arsenals, territory, and things that they had not paid for, and she was perfectly willing to sacrifice her best beloved to establish the sincerity of her convictions. Partly by her influence, but chiefly for lack of any other mate- rial, he was made Bishop by brevet, and Briga- dier-General by confirmation.  Unfortunately, for the cause which she knew to be pure and just, his sermons bored his soldiers sadly, while his generalship did not at all harass the enemnly. Had the Northern forces been obliged to face his sermons instead of taking his positions, in all human probability, the contest would have ter- minated differently.  As it was, however, the victorious armies swept over and around Lookout Mountain, and surren- der, on the part of its defenders, became a Pan- theistic Necessity-the bear-garden was stripped naked, the elephants, rhinoceroses, etc., having   been killed and eaten by the half-starved sol- diery, in the first stages of the siege. The Her- ring safe was carried off and did duty for memor- able months of the campaign as a meat-safe at the headquarters of the invading army. In short, if any one can find a trace of Le Beaucage in the vicinity of Lookout Mountain, point to its local- ity, or even bring forward a reliable gentleman or intelligent contraband who ever saw it, he will be rewarded handsomely. St. Twel'mo is shelved.   My story is done. I am not aware that it has any moral, nor did I design any in the outset, beyond indicating the danger of leaving dictiona- ries in the way of children, and pointing that pecu- liarity in woman's nature which inspires them to love those who beat and bite them. However, if any can glean other morals from it, they are at perfect liberty so to do.   tMR. sO H.
