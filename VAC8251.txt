Shrinking hearts would be dismayed at.  its terrific approach, were it not for the sense of security which the lightning conductor gives. A ship is telegraphed as having several  cases of . malignant disease -on board; but we know she will be detair ed in quarantine until her passengers are examined, and precautionary measures. are taken for their removal to the island set apart for their benefit. A  sense of security is every where ap- parent.  But there is a wail in yonder hovel. A manhae s  yielded to the 'debasing influences of a perverted appetite, and become furiousnand uncontrollable. -.   4         PREFACE  '  Officers are called in, and he is removed to the watchhouse, there to await a sentence which, shall doom him to the penalty of a temporary home in the penitentiary. The sense of security does not pervade this household. - In yonder palace, the princely proprietor thereof has' fallen asleep upon a damask couch. It is not like common rest, which invigorates toil-worn bod- ies, but a heavy, deep slumber, such as comes from perverted indulgence which knows no laws of self- control. He claims the right to partake as freely as he desires of whatever contributes to his grati-: fication; and society concedes it to him. There is a false security here, the great standard of wealth, not character, being the observatory from which men have looked out. If, therefore, in our utterances from the palace, we have- shaded our picture too dark,-if in the background there seem indications of a tremendous tornado,- do but turn your gaze to the opening blue between those parted clouds, and you will be re- lieved to know that we shall soon ^find ourselves in              PREFACE.            5 a clear, genial atmosphere, which the bright sun is irradiating with his loveliest splendor. Hope :on, work on, ye brave and courageous phi- lanthropists.  The victory is well worth the sacri- fice of all your toil; and the result will open a new paradise, where the serpent shall be lifted up, that, as in olden  time, those who -look upon    it may live.

L The old Liquor Store and its Occupant.-The early History of Samuel Beals, Jun.- His Marriage, and Death of his Wife. MR. SAMUEL :BEALS, JUn., is a whol,.ale liquor mer- \ chant, whose place of business is on one of the most  central wharves in the city of----  . The store in which he traffics has no very inviting exterior-it is a low, odd-shaped building; one corner'of which V as cut off several years since to widen the street upon which it stood. It has 'a figure of six. aides--hence it is some- times called the "hexagon building."  There are no showy glass windows, no high ceilings, no Carpeted counting rooms, no outward or inward attractions, as common-visioned people account an "inviting aspect." The sign over the door has lost much of its freshness, 2  "     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR,. for it has hung there exposed to the salt water breezes for years, and only when the sun throws a slanting ray iacross it does it seem to. show the once gilded letters of the name "Samuel Beals, Jun., wholesale dealer in choice spirits, importer of wines, teas, &c." Now, walk inside the store with me, and let us see wherein the attraction lies, for certainly there is a charm which draws multitudes, and it has been said no man in the city is doing so extensive and lucrative a business as Mr. Beals. But how can we wedge our way 1within? The entrance- seems completely blockaded, by puncheons, ppipe, barrels, and quarter casks. Still, by running hie risk of snagging your overcoat and encountering the damp rust which surrounds the cask hoops, by carefully threading in a zigzag course, or following that dapper- looking young trader who knows how to enter this place, . you, too, may find-your way safely. Upon entering the store, you will find the plank floor damp and blackened -a sort of steam in a hot day seeming to ascend, so that your olfactories are tingledd with the unmistakable ,odor of a liquor store; and as you are still surrounded by the standing casks, (all duplicates of what' we have just seen at the door,) you are perfectly aware this is a place of extensive business. In yonder dingy counting room two men are standing, apparently settling a bill. A clerk, witl a pen behind his- ear, is retreating from his leger, and the two gentlemen are intently turning over the   THE REIGNING KING.      .   15 "account of sales." Let us wait a moment, and look at the busy truckmen who are so lustily rolling into the cel- : lar those heavy pipes, and at those stalwart men who are hoisting with their tackle the great butts, which are of a particular stamp, and designed only for the upper story. Well, there is no end to this work: mpre trucks are at the door; more liquors are to be landed; and there is a greater difficulty than ever to force an ingress to the premises; yet still the customers come continually. As that business in the counting room seems to be ad- justed, we will walk in, and, at the first moment's leisure, reintroduce you, my friend, to Mr. Beals, the proprietor of this store. lie, in turn, will introduce us to Mr. Tims, the retail grocer, who buys rather heavily, being himself "n the city trade, having gained great celebrity by the sale of "choice liquors, of Beals's importation." Mr. Samuel Beals is no dandy in appearance. He wears a slouching oversack; lis pantaloons are shockingly spotted; his vest, being a light buff, is somewhat dingy; and his large-checked handkerchief upon his neck is tied very carelessly, with the long ends floating, considerably. soiled from being frequently tucked within the shirt bosom. The countenance of the man could never be correctly taken by the daguerreotypist, and pronounced "a perfect likeness." The. trouble lies here: he changes his expres- sion so often, that you at times hardly recognize him as the same man. The bland;look with which he meets his   1 6 ..UNCLE S4A1'S PALACE ; OR, best customers; that hearty shake of the hand he gives them; that winning accent with which lie inquires, "Do you take a heavy amount to-day?"- is' altogether different from the manner with which he greets that old delinquent debtor who is munching an apple behind a quarter cask, who receives a very indifferent nod, and only in passing hears the interrogatory, 'Can we settle our, account to- day, Mr. Whisk?"And then there is another expression for the bookkeeper - that poor fellow who is goaded with labor which is never done; who sits up till past midnight half the year, to bring out his trial balances, and draws off such long accounts of liquors sold, that he sometimes fancies the strange buzzing sensation in his head, and the inflammatory state of his vision, is essentially impaired by the fumes of the article he writes about. - But then the month's settlement makes all right. "A thousand dollars salary," "the good will" of Samuel Beals, and some extra perquisites occasionally, relights his countenance, takes the paralysis out of his fingers' ends, wipes the inflammation out of his eyes, and he is heard to declare "he would not exchange his'situation for any, other in the city." Day in and out, week in and out, year in and out, this business is steadily carried on, without interruption or change. The same shipmasters and shipowners 'conv ey the precious liquors across the briny waves, and bring them up safely into the harbor, so that they are speedily :anded -  : ,       -       '  -' e , iIW i   THE REIGNING KIiVG.        17  in the custom, house, "pure and unadulterated." But how long, think you, they remain so? for be assured all the profits df the sales do not come from simply drawing out the farticle, and transferring it to the buyer's account. When you went into the cellar" of this old store, did you, notice, in a back corner, a pump? That is the most ser- viceable- article in the place; and Mr. Beals would no sooner suffer the pump to remain one day out of order, than he would give up his best customers. There are men, too, employed very near this spouting spring; but ' we have no fault to find with the introduction of the water, our preference being for filling the casks entirely with the liquid, only we were' questioning about Mr. Beals's war- rantee statements that what he sold was the "genuine, znadulterated article;" but this he explained well enough to quiet his own conscience, by the assertion, "he was no professor," as if herein lay a'license to traffic just as he pleased.- Yet Samuel Beals was accounted an honorable mer- chant, a good citizen, a shrewd fellow, and altogether a respectable, common-sensed, fair individual. At the time of our introduction to him, his trade was considered just as reputable as any other calling; indeed, it was highly prized: as the most desirable business, if one put into ac- count its lucrative advantages. It took but a few years to make a poor man a rich one, if he understood his business. He must be a man, however, who could read customers- 2*          -   18    .  UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, one who had sagacity enough to tell who' would pay promptly, and who would be a delinquent; and one of the main principles upon which such a idecision was ac- quired consisted in ascertaining how freely they used the article indzivdully; and if it were proved t/hemselves were the best customers, Mr. Beals always sold rather" cautiously; for, even at that. time, the effects were certain, although nobody ever thought of prohibiting the sale, or discountenancing the moderate use of the poison. Mr. Beals, however, arrived at his, present lucrative position by rather slow degrees. He came to this city a poor boy, the son of a respectable farmer in Vermont, who seemed to have some boys to spare, and "Sam " was resolved to try his fortune. He first worked as a common (' lumper" - beat up sugars, hoisted casks, carried parcels, and did all kinds of odd jobs; but being remarkably faith-  fufi, he was, in less than a year from the time he deposited his small bundle upon the counter, taken as a salesmah to stand behind it. He used to say-the day he accepted this situation was the proudest one in his life. He then threw -away his overalls, dressed himself in a suit of satinet, and felt he was a man. His master was a wealthy mer- chant; but thid methods of doing business then so mate- rially varied from the present time, that the small retailer would now hardly feel he had any position unless it offered more attractions than the wholesale dealer could. then make available. The small store in which this man t      / , - "  * i   THE REIGNING KING.        19 traded rented for four hundred per annum; the dwelling house above was occupied by the, ' storekeeper," and Sam Beals boarded in his family. It, was theen he secured the affections of his master's eldest daughter, which was the foundation of his worldly success. In long process of time, the old man retired, Sam was married, and suc- ceeded to all the privileges and, appurtenances belonging to the late stock and stand of the former proprietor. At-first, he lived frugally, 4'add young 1Irs. Beals man- aged to superintend her domestic concerns unaided; and a neater dwelling could not be found. But with all her !painstaking, she could never make a gentlemanly air in her husband. His rustic habits would cleave to him; his business was his all-engrossing theme; consequently, the main care of housekeeping devolved upon his wife. By this union they were blessed with but three children: the first died in infancy; the other two, Thomas and Eu- mce, survived their mother. Mrs. Beals was a woman of peculiar organization. She had great frailty of constitu- tion, but great energy of character. She was mild and serene amidst all perplexities; always saw a bright side to every thing; was devoted in her friendships; a lover' of good order; a meek, amiable, pious lady, who often regretted the worldly courses of her husband, and often ' threw in a mild reproof which worked its way into his heart as no other; counsel would. She particularly depre- cated the ruin which followed in the pursuit of his traftic,   20      UNCLE SAMiS PALACE; OR,  and might enphatically be called one of the first-convicted subjects, who would gladly have joined hands with modern reformers; but alas! no such class of persons then existed. She ihad seen a great deal of evil, in her time, from the excessive use: of ardent spirits ; and it may have been that she preyvnted her husband from becoming an inebrir ate, by the delicacy, yet flrmness, with which she denounced the common use of them as a beverage. She was often melted by the hardheartedness to which the trade gave rise. She pitied the poor, besotted victims, and frequently prevented her husband from being :accessory to their final ratin; but just as he needed her counsel to check him, and her judicibus advice to control him, she was seized with a disease, which wasted her frame, and left her a prey to that incurable malady, consumption. Even then she used to feel that she should die a hap- pier death-could she but emancipate her husband from the thraldom which she saw inevitably must come upon him as he progressed in his business. Money was not her god. She felt that we were accountable how we secured it, and how we approprtated tt; yet the future looked dark and dreary to her. She had, at times, indistinct foreshadowings of a change which must come upon society; and she continu- ally uttered a prayer for a release from the terrible bonrid- age with which intemperance enslaved its victims. She prayed, too, for the redemption and salvation of her bus-  band; for 'ste felt he was far from the kingdom, with all - his worldly'integrity. ,              .    THE REIGNING KING.      ;  21 In :her last days, she committed the care of her two  children to an elderly friend, with strict charge to'watch g over their education, and train them in the ways of wis- dom. To her husband she bequeathed a long and minute  detail, with which wre fear he did not strictly comply; yet a bystander at her death bed remarked, "she felt assured' thatlpast fervent prayer for her husband would be heard." For a time the family remained unchanged, save by the loss of the maternal head, which may ever be chronicled as thlq greatest of all possible bereavements, when it falls,  as in this instance, and removes the shield, protector, and director of thefhousehold. At length the housekeeper : became feeble, and incompetent to her task; the family were broken and separated; the children put to boarding i schools, and Mr. Beals was left to pursue his way a lone ! widower, with nothing to supply his daily happiness but the profits which accrued from his traffic. Indeed, he tried to wear off his heavy bereavement by plunging more intensely into his business. He now eno aged in new schemes. He purchased parts of vessels, in which he could bring his cargoes with more profit; and as he could then number many surplus thousands, he cared, apparently, for little else but his worldly gainsi feeling his children were well schooled, their bills promptly paid, and their wants faithfully attended. For years he pursued this traffic, until he became a perfect Shylock. His invested money   rapidly accumu*   22      -UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, lated; he was constantly taking mortgages upon ruined  families - not their lands and houses merely, but to him a they were literally mortgaging their characters; and,  strange to say, he evaded all the questionings of his, con- I spience in these matters. -! But travel along the pathway of life as we will, by and by there will be turning points, and we are forced out of the old beaten road into grassy lanes, or in bleak, rocky;  uninviting crossr ways, which conduct us to our journey's end.    ,            A          (  '  ,*   THE REIGNING KING.        23  CHAPTER II.  Change.--The- Daughter grown to Womanhood.- The new Phase of the Temperance Question. - The old Store rebuilt. - Unicle Sam proposes a Partner in the Firm. - Plans to build a Palace. - The Brown Family. - Their hard Struggles and hope- ful Trust. MR. BEALS had little gallantry about him; yet we cannot but believe that the soft and gentle influences of her with whom he was many years so intimately connected did wear off some of those rough and graceless manners which early characterized him in his intercourse with the ladies. For one thing we will give him credit; that is, a certain kind of respect for the female sex. He was often hardhearted in his business transactions with those who had no exterior polish-to the hard-handed working women, ungloved and slipshod in appearance; yet he never passed a lady associate without the most pro- found bowi with a tip of the beaver a minute or so after did not forget it. That he was often joked upon the subject of a second marriage admits ,  of no doubt; and that he sometimes used to have " revery fits," while indulging private thoughts upon the subject, helped to explain some eccentricities to the landlady with whom he boarded. SHe occasionally dined or took tea  24      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE;. OR, with a friend pleasantly situated in domestic life, and the , charm of such an interview always'-turned his attention to the subject of again securing a home of his own; but then he had a shrinking from the step-mother. He felt he might possibly select a partner for himself; but who would assimilate and be to his daughter a true mother? He never seemed to think it would be possible to keep his son at home, he was of such a wayward disposition. And then how often was he told by managing ladies, "Any body will marry you, Mr. Beals, on account of your money "! So that when Nabby Fields, the spinster, and Mrs. Dawson, the spruce young widow, spoke: most feel- ingly to his daughter, and kindly took her hand, and in- quired, "How is -your father's health now, dear?" he always wondered if there were not some sinister motives at the bottom; and so this drove out all reflections whether it would not be better to have somebody who felt interested about mending his coats, and sewing buttons on his shirts, and darning his stockings, not to speak of the higher offices of counselling him about the miserly, greedy, avaricious spirit into which he was sinking; for, say whpat we will about it, the mark of a good, discreet wife is al- ways visible in her husband. ,There is a controlling, as well as subduing, influence; and lif Mr. Beals had mar- ried the ihaiden lady or widow, undoibtedly he would have become more pliant and yielding in his future char- acter. But he used to talk about marriage in mercantile "          ' , I    THE REIGNING KING.        25 phrases; always spoke of "taking a risk,". and feared he might not get a " prime article," there were so many ,below par," in his estimation. To the best of our knowledge, he was never known to have made direct overtures to any lady since he had been a widower, unless lMrs. Flutterbug, the rich southern widow, who spent one summer at the north, and boarded at the same house with him, received some proposals. We are certain she used to advise with him about his dauighter's education, and ac- tually selected a harp for her, on which she learned to play most exquisitely, only her. father had no ear for musical sounds, save the clink of the dollars, and the child used to feel nobody appreciated her efforts, and then she wished she had somebody besides'an antiquated board- ing-house keeper to speak to, who only knew a couple of tunes, which were Old Hundred and Corinth. But years have now gone by. That daughter has arrived at womanhood. A graceful, accomplished, lovely girl rises before us. She opens a new gleam of sunlight in her father's heart; she reawakens those happier days when, by his own fireside, he heard a voice which, seems to be reringing in his ears, as that young creature dis- courses to him of themes far outreaching her years. The recollection checks the father in his career. It is but a momentary pause; but who can tell the blessed effects of a transient emotion? There is, to  other cry from   \           ,   26      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR,  strange quarters. The inebriates themselves are deter- mined upon emancipation. They are knocking off their old fetters, and the great temperance reform commences. It has long been unheard by the trafficker's in the deadly drugs. They have called it "a fanatical excitement," a determination to put down the trade by wlhich they have  acquired their wealth. But, the voice waxes louder; it is heard; it rings like an unceasing vibration occasioned by a bell tolling; and it has now reached the pitch which is carried out by waiting thousands, and i its reverberations will never cease till it has accomplished its whole work. We are compelled to pass over a period of some years, during which time Mr. Samuel Beals has attained the cognomen of "Uncle Sam."  He is known far and wide as the "extensive importer," and his wealth is reckoned not less than a million of dollars. He still -lives with his daughter in a most comfortable style of housekeeping, but is evidently much troubled by the reformatory measures of the temperance party.      I There are times when he has serious doubts whether he had better remain any longer in the business. It is not reputable, as formerly. nTis statement meets him -every where; yet 'he has a position to fill, and he will not yield it, and desert a party who regard -him as the cham- -pion and leader in all anti-reform- movements. But he is advancing in life; he feels the effects of age, which he disguises from himself. He is careworn. There are deep di sg uises fro m  hi mself.         l, e   THE REIGNING KINOG,     .   27 furrows upon his cheek; his form is not as erect as for- , merly; and, to say the least, he needs a change in his business. TFor many months his eyes have- rested on Tims, the man Nvhom we met in the counting room of Uncle Sam's store; -but that old buildingfhas long since been demol- ished, and given way to one of massive stone structure, five stories in height, and Uncle Sam is owner of the whole block, and for many' months, we were about re- marking, he has been on the point of broaching the sub- ject of a partnership to Tims, who is a smart business man, largely indebted to him, and who, he desires, should become interested in his wholesale traffic. But this very man has become rather tired of his business--rather sceptical whether it is a strictly moral one; and loaferism and drunkenness, and ruin and wretchedness, have been quite faithfully depicted before him in the ' retail trade," and he is resolved to work his way out of the business, only he hesitates about the heavy debt which he owes to Uncle Sam. He sees no way he can liquidate it, and yet discontinue the business; and he sees no way he can still prosecute it without compromising with his aroused con- science.  Uncle' Sam has indirectly hinted at his plan for a part- nership several times to Tims; yet he has never appeared to understand his meaning. He is now resolved to break the subject directly; so he called upon Sims, the lawyer,   28     IUNCLE SAM'S. PALACE; OR, to whom he has already intristed much of his business, and informed him he should put into his hands sundry accounts for collection, which would yield to him a fair percentage. He now openly declared his plans to his legal friend, which were, to erect a sort of palace in the suburbs of the city, the building of which would give employment to many who have bee] ,catalogued long on the " old score," and thus he could consummate his plans, wipe off his debts, partially retire from business, and become a more sedentary man. Just at this stage of the conversation, Tims came in. He was in a profuse perspiration, much agitated about the foreclosure of a mortgagewhich he held upon the Brown estate. Brown, it seems, had just been pleading with him not to cut him off from his equity of redemption; and as Sims. was an office seeker, bound for Washington at an early date, he could listen to no such " declamation," but proceeded forthwith to coerce all his legal measures. This would necessarily put the Brown family into ter-- rible straits. Tims felt he had been accessory to theirl downfall, and his conscience came in and pleaded power- ^ fully; but there was no time to be lost. s'he legal gen- tleman could not be dictated upon, such " petty matters as turning a familytout of doors ;" he therefore coolly dismissed the subject by, saying to him, "As you have   I THE REIGNING KING.       29   V taken possession, and the right of redemption has ex- pired, you may put, in a tenant as soon as you please." . Uncle Sam here .gave a severe thrust to Tims upon his cowardice; so, to escape the-imputation of effeminacy, he boldly marched -out, and the furniture of the Brown family was that evening taken over to two, vacant rooms which a particular friend of Mrs. Brown had secured for her. To show the blighting effect of this avaricious spirit, Mrs. Brown had been to Tims a most kindhearted, neighborly woman, and had often pleaded with him not to furnish her husband -with more liquor. Still, he did so; and, as an equivalent for his evil work, he now se- cured his services as a master workman upon Uncle Sam's Palace'; but as liquor freely circulated here, Brown was unable to discharge his duty; yet he- was not regard- ed as a degraded, ruined wretch. But Tims never wished to remember him, only there were some transactions he never could forget. Browh was a man of tremendous energy. He worked with. all his might, and he drank with all his might, and he fell as few fail; for there always seemed recuperative energies about him when he slept off the inebriating draught. Moreover, he was a man of good' education, and every body seemed to pity him rather than despise him; yet the fate of the drunkard's family seemed for a short time to be his. An eclipse came over Mrs. Brown's - 8                        \   30      UNCLE SAM'S P-ALACIE; OR, cheerful, trustful spirit. She looked upon her lovely daughters, doomed to perform stated tasks; she grieved that she could not procure more eligible situations for her children; and she saw what is most withering to a sensi- tive spirit, the "cold shoulder" among those whom she! esteemed as her most valued friends. A few days, however, and Providence seemed to gra- ciously, smile when moirtals frowned. She- that is, Mrs. Brown was an English lady by birth, a Bateman by name; and she had long expected a, remittance from" her attorney in London, who had previously assured her that a sum answering in ours currency to five thousand dollars would be forthcoming. 9 A letter, English postmarked, arrived the very week of her ejectment from-l her oId home; so, had Tims but listened to her entreaties, he, would have been the gainer after all,  To describe the joy which was thus diffused in this: family would be no easy detail; but alas! there was one impediment, one drawhack, -to all domestic bliss. The husband was still intemperate; and often as that crushed and blighted heart had pleaded with and for him, she yet saw but a faint glimpse that favored amendment. Yet hope somehow always solaced her. There seemed a fore- boding that a brighter day was about to dawn; and much as she prized the amount which had just accrued to her from her father's estate by a rise on a small piece of land, slie felt there was a stain, a foul spot, a blemish, she   THE REIGNING KING.        31 would rather have removed than be possessed of all the wealth of a mine of gold. Mrs. Brown was now looking for more eligible apart- ments, *hen, returning home after a fruitless search, she' found her husband sitting by the fireside in a more thoughtful mood than usual. As her eyes met his gaze, "Marcus'" said she, "I  have been running over in my mind the contrast in ou past and present condition. You remember the first year' of our marriage, how smoothly every thing went o  . Every body was then congratu-  ' lating me upon the fortunate circumstance of my choice. But I was proud then, foolishy so; and with your name I hated to have the word mechanic' associated. I al- ways felt that a tradesman was a much more reputable calling. Now look at my present cause for blushes. This whole afternoon I have been in pursuit of a few rooms; and whenever I gave my address, there was a shrinking, a falling back from a partial agreement to let me the premises. There seems a stigma, a reprdach resting upon me, and it does seem to me you can yet wipe it off. With the small inheritance which wil now fall to me, it woild give us a renewed starting point. We might purchase a cottage which would exceed in domestic fe- licity all the palaces built upon wrecked men who have fallen a prey to intemperance. Our children would then be so happy in feeling that no tinge of shame disgraced "   382     UNCLE SAMS PALACE; OR, their position in shy, and I, why, I would lift moun- tains of difficulty. The tear trembled in her hopeful eye, and her tones of encouragement carried a deep con- viction to her husband's heart.     ] Marcus Brawn looked in the mirror. 'He went into an adjoining room,and took down his best clothes, put on a clean dicke, brushed up his rusty boots, put a clean handkerchief in his pocket, mounted his best beaver, and walked out, saying "he had an engagement, and should be back at nine o'clock that evening"' The heart of that wife died within her. She knew the military company to which he belonged gave -a supper that evening; that Tims, the grocer, was one of the offi- cers, and would be at -the festal board. She looked with her straining, tearful-eyes after her husband. How well, thought she, he looks! How swiftly he walks! and she thanked God,all his manliness had not 'yt died out; and the remembrance of what he tas somehow inspired a hope of what he might yet become; and she fell into a pleasant revery, almost forgetful of the slights and stings she had incurred in house hunting -that afternoon; for she wias buoyed up with the fact that she could any time pay her quarter's rent in advance, which would soften the rigor of the hardest, landlord. Thus cheered, she se herself aboutlher usual tasks of repairing and restoring what time had effaced, and knew not why, yet there seemed a presage of good before her.                          A    '1diJE REIGNING KING.     - 33 It was now nearly nine o'clock. Her children were at their different homes, and she was alone. She raked open the bright embers upon the hearth. She dreaded to  watch for her husbanlld's footfalI, lest some one should lead- him home intoxicated; but presently a brisk step, not to be mistaken, was heard on the stairs, and Marcus Brown returned in his right mind. He had refused to be present at the military supper, and, instead, had been out in the suburbs and engaged a neat little cottage, stopped at a temperance lecture, and manfully signed the pledge.' We are often called to witness excessive grief, but more seldom ecstatic joy. Its manifestations differ in' different temperaments. Mrs. Brown's heart overflowed with grat- itude; yet she had few words. She could neither sleep nor eat. Her usual labor fatigued her. She felt a frantic wildness which coursed the lifeblood rapidly through ier   " veins; and were it not for a sense of misgiving that the - pledge might not be kept, who can tell to what height her transport might have risen? Yet she made no open proc- lamation of her joy.  Her cup was full. She dared not crave a symp thizing friend to share it, lest it should be again dashed to, earth. The next morning, her husband went off blithely in search of employment. He had no difficulty in procuring it, as he was one of the best of workmen, and returned that night as regular as a  clock, having engaged a job which would hold out for the three succeeding months..  ' '    q4    .UNCLE SAd'S PALACE; OR, It was a full week before Mrs. :8rown acquainted her children of the extent 'of her improved conditioi. Slhe was then on the eve of removal, and was about to gather again together the scattered household i and when she left the city, Mrs. Godfrey, the newsmonger of the neilghbor- hood, declared "it was her firm beli f, that ten women as righteous as Mrs. Brown would save any-Sodom."  Wh-o, then, could doubt her influence over her husba. d and family, ,when they yielded to her undivided' sway? Tims -and Brown had a long conversation about this time. The former was terribly harrowed by some re- marks which were made to him. There were dark deeds and sombre circumstances which could not be explained away; and-really we may well question whether Tims rejoiced at the bright prospect which was dawning upon this family, since it had been recently suggested that Brown was admirably fitted for a temperance lecturer, and, if true to his pledge, would probably soon be actively engaged in the cause.      THE REIGNING KING.        35 * ',   CHAPTER     III. Broken Threads.-- Discussing Copartnership. -Office Seeking and its Consequences. BROKEN threads! In an operative's room    stood a dark-haired girl intently watching the lightning velocity of her shuttle, as, like a thing of life, it darted ever and anon before her wishful gaze. It seemed, at first sight, as if no  impediment ever arrested the busy weaver; ' when suddenly there was a pause. A  thread had broken  and the machinery was stopped but a moment for repair- ing it, and again its busy movement went on as before. In a  moment after, when in the full tide of activity; an- other broken thread required adjustment. The maiden, observing  my watchful attention, exclaimed, "But for these broken threads, I could accomplish a double task." How significant, thought I, is the similitude between this machinery of man's ingenuity and the mighty loom in which Providence permits us to weave our life's eventful tasks! But for the broken threads, how prone are ie to believe the fabric of our existence would be of a' more enduring texture, and a  more desirable finish! ' But is it so?  Let us look at it, and see. In the hu- nan machinery no skill can avert certain interruptions   UNCLE SAI' S PALACE; ORn  which compel ul to stop a while, and repair the slight breakages which are incident to all human labors. Were that shuttle to continually ply back and forth, never need-' ing its celerity to be clhecked, here would be the want of her who so patiently watches and tends it? Just so it is in our life's experience. Broken threads help us to keep more diligent attention to the woof and warp of our being, if we would make a symmetrical finish .to our labors.  I looked upon      u   sehold. There were children, and bright hope, ad eager expectations, and a moter's assiduous care watched over .their destiny. But there was a broken thread. The father was an inebriate. Day by day had he drank in the destructive poison, and by gradual processes had it destroyed the vitality of his being. His manliness was sacrificed. The stamp of the divine lineaments was obscured. Still carefully did that mother plan, exquisitely she wrought, or on fabrics of a coarser texture would she fill up all the little gaps of daily,  life, as if to make reparation for that part of the ma- chinery which was not in a sound condition. Few hearts were made acquainted with that daily sat- rifice. The world looked coldly on,, reiterating the ex- pression that " a notable housewife. can supply the wasted energy of him who should stand at its head;" and so she was left to struggle with those conflicts which only those who have suffered can realize, but which theFy can never 0   *       *  rot~~~~~~h    THE REIGNING KING.   .37   portray, since there is a delicate privacy amidst a wreck of buried hopes, when the sun of existence is eclipsed, which appeals only to Ieaven for its succor and deliv- rance. Nor, let the broken threads of such an existence be repaired; set the machinery once more in motion; put a cheerful glow upon that late haggard countenance, a light step u)on those toilworn feet, a song such as only comes - from  i merry heart; let this change be effected by the redetition of that husband and father, and who shall say but for those broken threads the present zest of life would never have been so keenly realized?   Not 'that Mrs. Brown (whose history has all along run in our thoughts) would haVe undelgone such a fiery ordeal to attain such an issue, but that Providence does so 'purify the soul by bitter experiences, that the sweet sunshine of life seems afterwards to beam out from those parted clouds all the more radiant for its obscuration. All this while, the world, to Mrs. Brown, had been a, panorama.   She had seen pass before her its hollow- heartecliess. She had marked how one companion after another had relaxed their intimate hold upon her friend- ship when she labored alone in obscurity; and when the voice of cheer entered her apartment, the ringing ex- pression of gladness was wanting; rather monotone utter- ances, bidding her hope on, seemed the tender expressions    88      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; ORB, 'of friends; for alas! these wdre hot her. "prosperous days."  But again the scene shifted. Since her husband had become a man pledged to abstinence, and adhering there- to, she had learned to live without the fond friendships of 'her former associates; yet now how kindly and tenderly was she urged to renew such intimacies! And when the crowning grace which money conifers was -added, and she once more lived in a " genteel way," how many suddenly remembered " what an agreeable woman Mrs. -Brown once was!"  Her daughters were now intelligent and talented young ladies. She who stood at the loom-watch- ing the shuttle was surrounded by admirers, and declared to have a mind above her- circumstances, Wlhich was not realized before. But Mrs. Brown was a woman of rare discernment. - She suffered the present aspects to pass, before her, and learned therefrom a salutary lesson. A few choice friends were selected, with whom she was on familiar terms; but the blandishments of fashion, of luxury, and idleness had no attractions for her. kIt was even a matter of most serious inquiry with her whether what the world calls 6  more " eligible situations," which did not now require so much positive exertion as her former lot, were, after all, as well fitted to develop the true essentials which lie at the basis of all worthy enterprise and exalted character. So she carefully trained her children, as a skilful gardener f              . t    .    THE REIGNING KING.    -   39 his choicest hedges, endeavoring to lop off all excres- cences, and restrain all enervating indulgences. Then, too, she lived in :daily fear lest, in some moment of temptation, her husband should yield to its fascinating spell; and how judiciously was she here called on to minister words of gentleness and, gratitude for his deliv- erance, knowing, as few women seem to know, that the affectionate, yearning love of a wife will often stand as 'a talisman to ward off the impending trial of temptation, when all other influences are weak! Had Mrs. Brown been appreciated, she would have been considered little else than, a guardian angel, such as no "spiritual rap- pings" would bring out from the dreamy land, but a living personification of a Christian wife and mother. Her children were now all gathered in one home, schooled, disciplined, and usefully employed. Their father was a repentant man, but perhaps not so happy a one as if he had never fallen; for can we wipe out the spots which have ever tarnished, our well being? At all events, he wa$ an industrious, reclaimed man, who sought to make am en'ds for all the errors of the past by uttering the warning voice, "Beware: touch not, taste not, handle' not," to all who fell within the scope of his. influence; and Tims, the grocer, and he had lately had a- long con- versation, after which Brown neler expressed himself so harshy as before conceining his ejectment from his house. So, having arrived at a convenient stopping place to take   40     .U4NCLE SAI'S P'iLACE; OR,  a present leave of the fortunes of the Brownfamily, we will take a glance at Uncle Sam, his attorney, and Tims, the grocer, who are discussing the grounds of copartner- ship, and the liabilities of all the parties interested. W "What," exclaims my indignant reader,' "Uncle Sam has hot prevailed, and poor Tims broken his resolution, ind about to enter the firm as originally proposed!"Let - us listen a moment to some previous conversafiolns:- "The indentures must bel drawn up before you leavr us, Mr. Sims," remarked Uncle Sanl  "They may be made to run for the term of five years. I feel active and sprightly enough to hold on that time in a silent capacity, and maintain my seat in the counting room. You, 3ni Tims, may, attend the customers, and in a short time you will accumulate sufficient to change your style of living. That will satisfy the ambition of your wife.' I suppose 'most women can be bought with a granite front, and damask, and tapestry," he playfully remarkel.  Still! Tims looked moody.  He did not feel quite sure he could enlist in the trade. -He wanted further' time for, consideration. Uncle Sam was terribly imbittered by this untoward remark, and appealed to Sims to sustain him; and to show how deeply interested his legal adviser felt in the ; matter, he replied by inquiring "Lwhether either of the gentlemen had'read the article in the Morning Journal   ':  'THE REIGNING KING.       .41 under the signature of 'Ajax.' That," said he, "eam- braces my views :of the political state of our country. I find it proves a taking article, and I suppose it may lend me. more influence in securing an appointment than all , I have ever done or said in my lifetime." Uncle Sam was vexed beyond endurance, and the venom was discharged by a free use of language. -The idea that he had been making such important statements as to the manner in which he could draw'up the copart- nership, added to Tims's desire to postpone the affair, -and Sims's interrogatories about, the written document signed "Ajax," so completely nettled the old man, that had he not intrusted so many important documents to Sims, he would have rushed out of his office, and left him forever. As. it was, he - could effect nothing but simply append his name to a check for three hundred dollars in favor of Sims, to enable'him to prosecute the business of office seeking at Washington. -Wre may as well here subjoin a short history of John Sims's political career, as it helps'us to explain some of the eccentricities 'of his- character. For many years the love of office seemed to be the ruling passion of his life; consequently he had studied the arts of stump oratory to the exclusion of "Coke ox; "Littleton." He was there- fore an eminent politician, rather than a profound lawyer. In three successive campaigns he had been a foremost leader, He declaimed at home and abroad, and never 4-   4X2     UNCLE SAM 'S PALACE; OR, wanted for political "backers" who were ready to ac- knowledge his claims for 'preferment; yet he was contin- ually destined to be defeated; and hnad -John Sims been any -thing but- an unflinching man, he would have left his party, many-a time, in utter disgust.. For had he not been promised a seat in Congress acgain and again, yet failed of securing a nomination? And when his own clique proved recreant to their most solemn asseverations to support him as their candidate, was he not told his de- feat was all- attributable to a set of " bogtrotters;" and was not this the secret of his newspaper articles upon "the political effects of emigration?" Yet the hopeful spirit of Squire Sims did not forsalje him. ;His party still acklowledged his claims. Could they have forgotten them, When the hospitable' treatment they had received at his hands rose so vividly before them?  When other people wondered how it was that Sims never had accumulated any more, could they not have explained it by referring to the oyster suppers and the sea of champagne that so often and so freely flowed at  his expense?  Depend upon it, mly friendsj this office seeking has some " items " attached to it which make sad inroads upon a professional gentleman's pockets. Million- naires like Uncle Sam do not always foot the bills, although they often furnish the principal entertainment "at cost." And now the old party with whom our legal coun- sellor: had conferred for years had lost their power,x *        I -   THE REIGNING KING. 4,3 and, for Sthe first time in his life, Squire Sims began to think about a .change in his political views. Of course, this had led to much distrust and bad feeling in those to whom he had been zealously attached; and it was only by a vigorous series of articles in, the leading journals of the day, which were devoted to the'new administration, could he seek to gain popular favor. Still, at this time, "Ajax" was in no very enviable situation. The surmisings which' attend a "turncoat," the , distrust with which they are early considered, the neglect of old politicians who have been fed and toasted at the expense of him who has forsaken them, the invec- tives which are hurled at him, the loss of confidence which manifests itself in withdrawal of legal patronage, the obliteration of the past, with its many favors-- all are forgotten when the new views are embraced which   ' have led to atchange in .the administration of govern- ment; and Squire Sims was just now passing through this dilemma. Yet he had espoused a few warm friends - had taken the field, and boldly defined his present po- sition; and, of course, not a few promises had been made him  that he would be seliceted' for somei eligible post in governmental affairs.              J, And   now how his old associates branded his with- drawal from  their party as being influencedi by sinister motives! how retentive were . their memories to bring to light some mean   acts of which he was guilty while-   " .:-   UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; ORn, identifieed' with them! h!ow they recollected about'bribe. money to secure votes, and. of intimate friendships found- ed on a' desire to secure patronage! and nobody remem- bered the slavish work he had done, and what remnnera- tion they had promised, because they were defeated and despoiled of power. Luckily, however, for Squire Sims, Uncle Sam was no rabid politician. If so, he would have at once withdrawn all intercourse withl a man who' had swerved from his party. As it was, h"e had expressed himself most freely upon the folly of office seeking, but always concluded by remsarkiing " it was as natumlfoi Sims to live on especta- tion as his daily 'food." There was, too; a kind of ac- knowledged affinity in the relationship of second cousin, which Uncle Sam and the Squire often talked about. This had led the liquor merchant to throw a great deal of business in his way; yet greatly to Uncle Sam's regret, he never could find his friend accumulated much. The Squire was far from being a "Brummel," yet he led the fashion for his tailor, and defaced a great deal ,of, nice broadcloth. Then he had an inkling for gentility in regard to a boarding house. He liked to be identified among "first-class people," and to associate with mar- riageable young ladies, who would occasionally accept of a ticket at an opera, when he had no engagement at "thle club house;" and that he was by no means indifferent to his personal appearance was evident from his cultivating     ;! .  i      THE REIGNING KING.        45 a splendid goatee, and underbrush and whiskers to match, only they wrere of an iron gray color, and. the process of continuallf dyeing, when old father Time was fore4er demanding his due, caused him, at length, to issue a writ of ejectment, and cause his barber to give him a clean shavpe/  Hi$ credentials were now furnished him by his new party, attesting his eligibility for any office within the gift of the president; and just at this untimely hour of prep- aration for starting for Washington, how could he be ex- pected to be interested in drawing up the terms of Uncle Sam's new copartnership! How could his eyes be forced to rest on the old blank forms, "Know all men by these presents)" or, "'This indenture of two parts made and con- cluded," &c., when the tailor had just sent in his new suit of broadcloth, and the washerwoman his waxy, shining shirt bosoms and high dickeys, with an extra polish and, stiff- ness; so that there was no chance of breaking down here, let what calamity follow that might, unless, by repeated friction, his ears wore away, from being constantly fretted against so sharp a surface as his highest dickeys pre- sented! His landlady remarked this day, as he jumped into the carriage equipped for- this experiment, "that a neater man than Squire Sims her eyes never rested f  upon."                 ; But just think, for a -moment, of his errand., A full- grown man, six feet high, reputed of sound mind, with o*"                        "  -    UNCLE SAM 'S PALACE; OR, plenty of business in his dingy office, and in constant receipt of more; able to support himself independmntly; descending to ask his friends for credentials to state that what appearedupon the surface was true, with some hun-    ' dred names certifying the fat, driving off to the seat of government to present his claims for some appointment within the gift of a man who himself might be dropped at the close of his first term.  it looked unnatural; and, further,- to find him actually on the spot, wedged into' a crowded hotel, content to hang on a bare peg all night with his overcoat; to mingle with' the hungry herd, all on the same errand; to be repulsed; told to wait; assured by some- there was not the least chance of success; to, crqwd around the doors of the White House, unrecog- nized, save by a few. equally eager and determinate seekers; and then, after all thllis severe and protracted trial, toread that the very appointment he sought has been given to another, every way 'his inferior - why, Mr. Sims, does not your pride revolt, and cause you to take passage on- some underground railroad, so that your identity may not be recognized?

But we will let the man speak for himself:- WASHINGTON,   - MR. SAMUEL BEALS, --Dear Sir: I have now been in this place some six weeks, hoping, expecting, but noet as yet, ralizing, any preferment. Yet I am not alone. Scores, who have spent their last cent to get here - who have hurrahed and shouted until bronchial tendencies are in their open throats 5 men who have forsaken their call- ings i1 quest of something more lucrative; men who at home demean themselves with dignity -   are here in as low a capacity as the servants they leave behind, since they only occasionally make a strike for higherwages. A very respectably dressed man, of pleasing manners, ac- costed me just now. Said he, "I perceive, sir, you are a patient waiter. I have been here for the last six weeks; have left a thriving business in a mechanical line, with the expectancy of obtaining the post-office department in our little, village; but I  have just been told that a man whom I never suspected desired it has, by letter, obtained this post; and I   am crowding  .my  way to give the presi- dent a  piece of my mind upon' the subject." A man  behind us, happening to overhear him, burst into a. hearty laugh, and giving my friend a heavy slap upon the shoulder, added, "  Go home, sir, and attend to your machinery.  The president cannot listen to your'    tO0     UNCLE HSAM S PALACE; 01 petty details, even if you are slighted. Why,' not less than seven hundred are this day seeking a personal inter- view with him."  The man- shortly after disappeared. Women^, too, are among this igAhty tlrong. Walk, up Pennsylvania Avenue, some bright morning, and look. upon forms clothed in brocade, who are leaning upon the arms -of men with careworn countenances; and by and by, as they closely converse, you will see a richly em- broidered handkerchief taken out to wipe away a tear. They, perchance; are waiting for a remittance to cary h them back. Hundreds are in a similar case. Still, I have some hope that- I shall succeed. J. iSIM S.

AGAIN the office of the attorney is' reopened, and, Uncle Sam stands by his desk. He utters himsel-If in a choleric tone of voice. "The major's account must be attended to. This family must be broken up. He has mortgaged me his entire property, and I must have pos- session. People that will drink, Squire, must pay the penalty. There's no friendship in trade; and there's Peter Mason, and Jim Sikes, and Theodore Lamh , and Cornelius Buckram, all stupefied with liquor-men who are on the verge of drunkards' graves--I must ave from all of, them such satisfaction as you can obtain.

It wouldnot bring any thing if put in an auction room; and she pleads for it as the only relic of her drunken husband. Shall she keep it, Mr. Beals?" No," replied the old man ith firmness.

"'And what shall I do with old Nelly's cows, Mr. Beals?" "Sell them for the most they will bring, and give me the balance." "IA nd with Johnny Brattle's account? He has been a hard-working man.". "Ajax" began to relent; yet he was ready to obey peremptory orders; and to all these questionings Uncle Sam invariably urged "an immediate settlement." Now, one may inquire how so many petty accounts canme to be inserted in a wholesale merchant's affairs; but the truth was, Beals was a man of ready cas'-always had a surplus for investment; and so, when a loan of a fePw hundreds was required, he lent it upon good se- curity; and thus a frequent recital, from women of the cruelties and trials to which intemperance subjected them made Uncle Sam rather callous to their entreaties; and,  besides, he was nervously sensitive upon the subject of the anti-liquor law, which threatened to impair his future gains; for a million of ill-gotten dollars did not- satisfy the rapacious, miserly love of gaining yet another. Such are some of the results of the money lender, who thus en- courages intemperance by every Mnortgage he takes upon an inebriate's premises, trusting to his promises for re- demption. , I             * ,     }*- ,     .          \   52     UNCLE, SAM'S PALACE; OR, "It's 'just as I have always said, Mr. Beals, that the law must. meet such obstinate cases. You may preach forever to these old soakers; and iunless, you put the article out of their entire reach, you can never reform them." " Well, I know it's so, Squire; and that's- the reason I never would retail the stuff. Yet I've seenl a mighty sight of difference in the working of the law to prohibit it. When it first passed, there was a kind of check put, upon the retailers out of the city. They kind o' feared the temperance hands would complain on 'em, and so they didn't dare to buy much; but I used to tell my best cus- tomers, when they came in with their long faces, 'to 'go it' I'd face the bill. If you are prosecuted, I'1i pay your cost,' says 1L And most on 'em did try it; and when they got indicted, I used to send bail and stand costs of prosecution; and you know as well at I, Squire, money will do e'ena'most any thin;g." Squire Sims bowed a cordial assent.  (You see, the temperance folks are in a nice fix. The judges drink their wine, and the jurors do not all sign the pledge; and when they look to have their law executed, there is a loophole, or a ' license' or some chink throutg which they crawl beyraying a small fine; and then they make up in a day or two twice as much as the verdict, and go on, it may be, forever, without being again prose- cuted." / *  -         \          '   " on    THE REIGNING  KING.       53 :The old liquor merchant here chuckled over a story. "There Was Bent, the grocer just out here, that sold an awful sight of liquor. It seemed as if every body got drunk in, his village, he couldn't have retailed more. But the Iaw nettled him somehow. There were- one or two men who resolved to get him indicted. He came right to me about it; anrid I told him, ' Face 'em, my boy, and I'll stand consequences.' After a few days, he- came in again, with the sweat standing in great drops on his fore- head, and says he, 'Mr. Beals, what shall I gdo? They've got me indicted, and my wife is just about crazy, She says  I shall give up the trade.', 'Go about your business, you silly dog,' said I. Didn' I tell you I'd face 'em?' It put new life into Bent; and, with tears in his eyes, he squeezed my hand, and says he,' Mr. Beals, you shall be paid for all the liquor I buy of you, if I cheat every: Other creditor.' And, faith, he was as good as his word. I got every cent of my dues; but'when he failed, Smiley & Co. took twenty cents on a dollar, and jumped at that. You see wholesale business is profitable. There's no rub- bing out the fact, Squire. Where, but for this, should I have been? And now I hav6 several thousand dollars in mortgages, besides a trifle more where the assessors don't snake it out." And here he crossed his legs and gave a look of defiance as he spoke of ' tax gatherers." "I don't understand why you wish to sell out and close 54i , 5 .  X    54      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, up such a lucrative business, Mr. Beals," remarked- the -Squire. "You are about as hale and hearty as ever, and your experience must profit you a great deal." Yes, I -know it, Squire; but you see things have changed some. It ain't quite so 'reputable' as formerly to sell, even by wholesale. Some of my old acquaint- ances talk a good deal to me; and that thundering sprig of a minister we settled t'other day made it in Mts way to kind o' reprove me over somebody else's back. He drawled out something after this fashion: says he' Mr - Beals, if Mr r Nettleton is so reprehensible for selling his drams by the glass, won't you explain to me the less heinous sin of selling by the pipe?' He was a barefaced Scamp, to say this to me. I would- like to 'ask him how he would get along without the seventy-five dollar tax I pay him. He'd better take care how he throws stones in his. glass house. As you say, however, I'm about as faculized now as ever I was; but, you see, I've made enough; and now I'm willing to give a chance to seme- body'else to live. There's Budd, my clerk. I've prom- ised him an interest when I sell out. I think the firm- till* be - Ties, Budd, & Co. ;' and this will include in the. Co. something of a capitalist, I reckon."

"W ell, sir, if I am not called from home, I will set next Monday evening. I may be ordered to Washington again., I have an expectation." The merchant buttoned up his coat, tried the bandage on his gouty leg, felt in his inner coat pocket to see if his wallet was safe, took his cane, and, giving the Squire a rap over the shoulder, made a very antoward remark about the folly of "devilish office seeking," and closed the door. *        !         r              56     :UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, CHAPTEt V.

MR. iBEALS went straight from the lawyer's office to close up his terms with Tims, the grocer, and arrange the business so that a change in the firm might be announced at the earliest day. Much to his surprise, he found Tirems reluctant to assent to any proposition he could make. "Are you 'a fool, Tims," pelted out the old man, :; that you hesitate about getting rich -at your time o' life? Ain't you got a family growing up, brimfiul of wants? and it takes no trifle to supply such a parcel, any how. Be- . sides, don't you want to send Enoch to college, and Sam to the engineering business? and what do you expect to do it with unless you give up this petty shop, where you are forever surrounded with loafers, and always endan- gering your premises by the ill will of such poor devils?" Tims intimated he had thought of trying some other kind of business. "Now, look here, my good fellow" said Mr. Beals, calming down the rough tone of his voice; "you know   THE REIGNING KING.        57 the old' saying, 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.'"  -  "And the other," quickly retorted Tims, " 'A burned schild dreads the fire."         . "But that's nothing to do with the case, here nor there. How many times must I repeat to you the mighty differ- ence between the wholesale and retail trade? I know well enouigh about your trials in the business. I know -   olwhat a bad name you got for turning out the Browns; and you were rather too fast there--a little too greedy for   the lucre, Tims. Folks called you rather hardhearted." This was a tender spot upon which the old merchant hit. Tims had a kind of nightmare dread of alluding to the subject; but the reflections thus awakened -embold- ened him to speak' freely of discontinuing the business. "'I am obliged to you, Mr. Beals, for your, interest , in me and mine ;but really, sir, I am  unwilling to incur any future stings of conscienceb trafficking any further in the business. I 'have been reading the law regulatingr the sale of ardent spirits. It may be a little. stringent just now, and for a time, so long as public opinion thus judges of things, it may be overthrown so as not seriously to affect either retailer or importer. But, Mr. Beals, there is rsense in drinking to excess, neither is there any in ]eing slightly elevated by a common dram.  I'e seen the mischief in all its bear- ings.  Moderate drinkers sometimes become inebriates. f    58 ;   UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, You remember when-old Job Stant swas a likely man, a good citizen, worked'well, and how gradually he fell, Mr. Beals:. He began to use spirit as a tonic. It braced him up, and he got his strength; but the very thing which procured his strength gave him the habit and the love of continuing the practice; and, in time, it produced a reaction, and weakened his physical energies; and you know his end.:'    "I should think I might," replied Beals. "I held his first mortgage.' The old man took a fresh quid of tobacco, and then he told a long yarn of a most pitiful history how the Stants begged him to put their father under guardianship, and save something for that decrepit boy that was finally landed in the poorhouse; "but I never meddled. Tims, you ought not to make an enemy of your neighbor's dog, He'll snarl and bark at you every time you pass him; and if he is restrained from doingo this, he'll give a low growl, or look at you through the fence as if he would revenge himself some tinze." "And there was Squire Dawes. I remember when a better-looking man did not enter our church. Straight as a gun barrel, smoothfaced and darkhaired as a Span- iard, he had graceful movements and a gentlemanly bear- ing, and, withal, he was so capable-always on the - parish committees, -foremost in recommending whatever would conduce to our well being in society; but he, too; found a drunkard's grave. Now, when I reflect over   THE REIGNING KING. v       59 all these characters, Mr. Beals, and realize the effects of the business in any form, it seems to me we are just as criminal as those whom the law considers accessory to any crimes. I cannot get over, such an interpretation; and therefore I am willing a .man of more iron nerve than myself should continue in sowing such seeds of ruin:" ; "Why, Tims, you talk like a minister. How long is it, pray, since you fell into sermon making. We'll have you appointed chaplain, or colleague with the minister, or some such office, where your talents may be appre- ciated more than. by liquor vending. Now, let me tell you, Tims, :this is only a bughear that you have started - a fit of hypo that will all end in smoke; and if you refuse the offer I have made you as -first in my firm, don't you count on me as ;one of your friends." The old man waxed wrathy. "Haven't I helped you out of a thousand straits? How much money have I lent you, when but for this you would have closed up your shop? Haven't I told you how to secure mortgages, and not to flinch at woman's - tears, nor fear indictments, nor a bad name? And this is all the gratitude I get, hey? Now, I'll give you till next Monlday morning to decide whether you wish to become partner in a- respectable firm, and die' a rich. man, or mind the foolery of some coscience strainers, who make, a hell in every- man's bosom where their theory touches. I did think, Tims, you had a stronger head."   60      UNCLE SAMbr'S PALACE; OR, Poor Tims was glad to accept of any delay by which he could get off without an actual commitment. The most he would consent to do; therefore, was " to consider the case;" and who ever considered the results of this traffic in ardent spirits, and came to the verdict that it. was best for his peace of mind to dontinue in the same? Yet the difficulty with Tims lay in the debt he owed to Uncle Sam. If he could have discharged it, thinkl you he would have parleyed further with him? Perhaps there is no 'grasp more tightly clinched than to be entangled in heavy liabilities to a sordid old man ,who wishes to use you as the tool by which he can covertly still blindfold others, all the while he is reaping the advantages of a silent copartnership, or, at least, a de- clared inactive one. Then to be, obliged to contend with ani irritated old man, who runs counter to your wishes, and is a complete barrier to exclude one's interest in the onward march of improvement, why, if we were thus, populated entirely, When, think you, we should try to enact a -law which would interfere with one's pecuniary interests? Uncle Sam stoodtfout q perfect tower of strength, ready to wrestle with any antagonist - ready to crush any hu- -mane effort to suppress the traffic; and yet he was the very man to declare, at all -times, "he was as much in favor of temperance as any body, only he wished no fa- natical movements, such as the law imposed,"   ' THE REIGNING.

Tims's Illness. - How produced. - His entangling Conversation. - The Copartnership ratified. - Tims, restored to Health, is - ^admitted to the Firm. - Action of the Church. ABOUT this. time, Tims was4taken sick. The disease was a slow, nervous fever. He had stood at the corners of the streets too much, of late, listening to Uncle Sam's persuasions. No doubt, many a fever has been thus superinduced. The mind being agitated, and suffered to ' brood over awhole tissue of coming evils whch we are assured must follow in the steps of wilful transgression, finally induces a morbid state of the physical energies, and from becoming thus' enervated, it falls a prey to that common disease termed by Ithe medical faculty " a slow fever."  -        ' 'Tims was now subjected to this disease, only attendant fupon it were paroxysms of excitement, when tte brain Iseemed affected, and he complained of hideous lfigures, monstrous spectres, and ghostly apparitions which stood before him whenever he attempted to sleep. The drowsy god could not be wooed by morphine, or any lethargic remedies. A powerful reaction to all such quieting in-' fluences was working, in the conscience.   THE REIGNING KING.        63 And what had Tims done? The world surely termed him a " respectable man and an orderly citizen." How, then; came this disquietude within himself? Uncle Sam had lately harassed him beyond measure. Being somewhat in his power, (that is, as we have said, a part of the purchase money of his -present " stock and stand " having been furnished by the old man,) he held a kind of subjective influence, which could not be readily resisted. We have 'all known men drawn by such en- tangling processes, and made to act contrary to their own unbiased judgments; for Uncle Sam was very lamblike when he could carly his purposes, but very wolfish when they were defeated. Indeed, his plans seldom failed; for his ready cash was such a powerful auxiliary to success, that it only confirmed in many minds the oft-repeated adage, that "money is power." Tims had learned the whole story. For several days previous to his being sick, he had been advancing the idea that 'he had thought of entirely changing his business, to which sentiment Uncle Sam in no way responded. He thus laid before him the speciousness of his reasoning':- "Here you are, Tims, comparatively a poor man, in the prime of life, with a family dependent on your exer- tions for whatever figure they may make in the world. You have the requisite quali'ies for a business man. You are energetic, industrious, always at your post. For this reason, I select you as my successor in the branch of X X .'   V;   U-   o J tw . C.- } itD l. 1J J tJtU x.J-:  x business I am about partially to leave.- I want to mnake a whole man out of you; Tims a shrewd money maker -one who can be reckoned by his thousanda; and don't you see the advantages, my good fellow, that will follow? Hang a man's conscience! It won't give him clothes or bread, Conscience does well enough for a bughear to scare old women, and it is a powerful weapon in the hands of- the priests; but let me tell you from my long  experience I have never known your conscientious stic- klers and praters bout the criminalityof pursuinality of pursuing this and that avocation that ever came to- be rich men. I've known men, after a longt life of traffic in questionable business, when they had accumulated enouge; to live like nabobs, who would become most morbidly conscientious --yes, horribly so; and I generally looked upon such as hypocritical pretenders, or as frightened into the belief  that in order to' secure the kingdom they had need to- go through a purgatorial process of purification. Now, Tims, in the name of common sense, don't listen to such ' old wives' fables.'  ' Don't you want your family to be well educated?  and don't it cost a trifle to do it? 3y single daughter has had more than two thousand dollars expended on lier education.' A large sum that; but the gal is worth the money - smart as a steel trap, quick at figures, great on music, and can waltz as well as the best on 'cm. Now, your children are just the same naturally; but how, in '   *    4!%^ ' I   -R EIGN1NG KING.        65 the name of wonder, do you expect to bring 'er out with- out the means? Let me see: for five children's good education there musti be an outlay of ten thousand dollars, reckoning on the principle I have gone over." Tims was moved in this matter. He had desired, above all things, to give his children a good education; and then his motto ran, "Let them shirk for themselves." This plaster was applied to Tims, and began to take hold, by changing, somewhat, the current of his thoughts. There was force in it. Here was an   opportunity to engage in a lucrative and perfectly safe business. Uncle Salm was still to preside at the helm, although ostensibly haviing retired. So, with such a man to face liabilities, one half the anxieties attendant ,upon usual business men would be avoided. But, behind all these alluring temptations to gain, there was Mrs. Tims, who constantly entreated her husband to renounce the traffic in ardent spirits, as he valued his soul's salvation. To some people she may seem as en- thusiastic and even fastidious in her prejudice against such business; but to others, who have witnessed! how whole families,have been ruined, and have looked into the consequences with a  clear vision,. there could be but ne opinion --that an evil existed somewhere which ought o   be removed. Tims, therefore, concealed from his wife he fact of being shaken in his determination to abide by Ler decision; and this engendered no happy frame of i 6 *    mind; for concealment is a canker worm which gnaws at the root of all connubial bliss. Where there are right feelings at heart, and a valued judgment is forsakelnou can never obliterate the fact, that, to be happy/ the marriage relation, a mutual frankness must be el erved. UJncle Sam, however, had entered a wedge which he intended should open a cavity large enough to admit all his desires, and permit him to carry into execution all his d designs. So he soon after again conversed with Tims. "Sims; the lawyer," -said he, "has been adjusting my : accounts. He looks them over there by the fire, witth the  women folks, ihn the dining room; and I ain't so certain but there's an undercurrent flowing. My niece and the old bachelor! But that's nothing here nor there. He says he is completely astonished iat the sales I have made the past few years. He adds, Tims, you are a fool to - reject such an offer, and ought to be put in the insane easylum at once, as a: confirmed lunatic, if& youl refuse the chIance. He'd be. mighty glad to step in your shoes, I tell ye; but what does a professional man know about secur- , ing customers, and discerning the black sheep from the  it white ones? Their eye teeth, are cut for using their strength upon delinquents: all well enough in 'their way, 3r but no practical training about 'em.  "Now, I want a partner that has sold liquor by the glass, then by the gallon, then the barrel, and, last of all, by the hogshead- and pipe - one that don't look upon a   THE REIGNING  KING.       67 man that sells it like a sea serpent, nor like an imp from hit satanic majesty that drinks a little now and then. Look at, me. Ain't I a clear specimen of a moderte drinker? Sometimes I take my brandy sling, sometimes my nice wine, and latterly I've used the best of Holland gin--that sometimes agrees with me best; but I ask you to point to a man of better constitution, of more vigor, (saving this old, gouty leg,) than I am, at my time o' life. I don't advocate your beastly drinkers; but a little, wisely        . ,  , taken, helps a man bear life's infirmities." "True," replied Tims; ,'but every body does not pro- portion the use of spirit like yourself. I must tell you, sir that I have seen so much of its mischievous'effects, so mLuc of its ruinous consequences, that I do most heartily hate and loathe it." "Now, Tims, don't get pathetic, and tell over how  you wroanged the Browns, and helped yourself to a  mortgage on old Dawson's estate, and how Finn wasfound dead by the roadside, itl a jug of ru he p rocuredat your store , e and hov old Peggy raved,)that .cold snap, at midnight about her brutal husband, to whom you sold the liquor. There always must be bitter with every sweet; and the business to which you are now removing has no such fearful, harrowing expedients about it." "But, sir, it is at the root of all the evil. I cannot disguise that fact from  myself." "Tims, you are worse than a woman -no pluck about 68      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR',  you. 'You are demented--need a guardian; arid I swear, Tims, unless you give over these silly inotions, I will make you raise the sum you owe me; and when I rip up the old score, you'll sing small, I tell ye. You'll envy the day laborer. But if you will toe the mark liike ;  ' a man, I'll do the handsome thing by you; and I'm able to do so, I reckon." Tims was a man who could- not stand a great deal of ridicule or reasoning. He was -easily warped; and' being of an amiable disposition, notwithstanding he had the name of doing some hardhearted acts, he could not dis- miss, get over, under, nor round Uncle. Sam's sophistry. He therefore resolved to passively submnit; and that day the indentures of a copartnership were executed. This was the sequel to the Pickness with which poor Tims had been afflicted. Mrs. Tims, meanwhile, was profoundly ignorant of what her husband had done, and might have remained so much longer, had npt old Mrs. Godfrey kindly stepped in to hear about- the sick man. "You don't think, sai s she, soon after entering, "that Mr. Tims's sickness had any thing to do with Uncle Sam's dogging him round so, do ye, Miss Tims?-" .  "m sure, Mrs. Godfrey, I know not t  t you al- lude."                :  r "Why, la suz, didn't he tell you how the old man .per- suaded him to join him in business, and how he'raved s/nd swore at him just the day before he was taken sick, and , .

Folks thought you would feel -it dreadfully, because thby all klnow ilhow pledgcd you are to ltemperance; but old Uncle, Sami's entreaties and threats go further than all the pray- elrs of the saints in thIe city. You see, when the money comes roIling in, and'you are promoted among- the; aris- tocracy, your conscience will yield like India rubber; and so you won't regret it so much, after all." I Mrs. Tims was confounded, but suppressed her aston- ishment, and let the old lady pursue hel gossip. She then detailed about bachelor Sims being in treaty-with Uncle Sam for his niece, Rosa Beals, the young lady from 'ernn tin who was visiting there; and asi that beat all she ever heard," she made it her concluding piece of information. After she had left, Mrs. Tims put some of the first items together, and resolved slowly to break to her hus- band the subject upon which she knew he was so terribly harassed, and to become; to him the comforter, even if his conduct did not meet' her approval. Som'etimes we can half reason ourselves into the belief that we  have acted upon partial judgment; and another side reveals to , us that -the picture need -not be set in so dark a, groundwork.   Mrs. Tims, therefore, felt it was inevitably decreed that her husband should be victimized by Uncle Sam to earn his daily bread by the importation {       I           -     1 .' ^    70   V  UNCLE SAM S PALACE; OR, aqd sale of liquors. She had prayed and pleaded for another issue, but it was otherwise ordered. So, now she resolved to make the best of it. That evening she reasoned her husband into so calm a frame of mind, that some sleep was induced; and the spectral illusions did not trouble him. after this. . The violence of his disease seemed mitigated; gentle plords- of construction were placed upon Uncle Sami's withering speeches; and the conclusion seemed to be, that if they should be thus thrown into a sinful traffic, yet a partial expiation might be made by appropriating to the poor and rel'eving the stufering by suck questionable gainss; and that other delusive species of reasoning, that lwhat hundreds of others' pursued, and were yet called our "respectable citizens,' might, after all, not be so diabolical a calling as it once appeared to them. Tims became a well man after all this disclosure; and the sign 'of "Tims, Budd, & Co." soon appeared where- "Samuel Beals^" lad stood for forty-seven years. But when it became noised abroad that Tims had fallen a prey to Uncle Sam's rapacity, and was about to form a copartnership with him, some of the leading members of { the church with which he was connected were seized with a "realizing" sense of their duity to take some action t-pon the subject. '  There were but five men in the society who were active advocates of the temperance' Icause, and but two of these   e/  *  * \      *           ..

Mr. Twirl, as to "the expediency of remonstrating. with brother Tims upon the bold, un- qualified course he ,was about entering." Deacon1 Jared Smart and Captain Timothy Tapewell were, appointed to wait upon the pastor at an early day. They did so. I The Re-. 71Mr. Twirl gave them a most cordial recep- tion in lis morning gown and slippers. When, however, 'they broke to him the/ object of their visit, he took the pen froml behind his ear, and casually remarked, "' Gen- tlemen, I vill leave you to mianage tilis affair according to your own discretion, premising, however, I have the most profound respect for brother Tims, and believe him to be a- man actuated by the hghlest Christian motives in his daily conduct: but having a sermon to prepare which re- quires a vast amount of labor, I -must ask you to release me from any active cooperation in this affair." "'But," remarked Deacon Smart, "we cannot release you, sir, from an expression of opinion in this matter. We wish either your signature to a document we -shall offer addressed to our brother Tims, or your personal re- marks, so that we may feel a'onfidence in your Support of our side of the quertioh." To this direct' request, :Mr. Twirl felt completely non- plussed.  He twitched down his pantaloons with a nervous   72     L--2CLE,- S-A3 's.

His voice, when he did speal, seemed somewhat tremu- lous; anid he repeatedly hemlme, as if troubled with a bronchial difficulty; and seeming to, forrget his haste, he thus addressed the brethren rwh  waited zon him: -- "Gentlemen; I have been settled over my flock five  and twenty years, and never have I found myself in so strait a place before.

"'  Deacon Smart evidently grew  fidgety.: He reitarkedl, "But 'e must not smother our convictions, Ir.'Twirl, a^nd become recreant to duty for fear of offonding our erring brethren."'  -  "True, true," added the clerical gentleman; "yet al- low me to tell you, brother Srnart, that I have seen so   THE RPEIGNING -KING.       73 many societies, who have meddled with the subject of temperance that have been broken up by, fierce and con- tentious merubers, that I must say I dread the encroach- ment of such a discussion.

"And brother Babbitt, who succeeded him,' who is such a champion in the cause and advocate for the anti- liquor law, has 'a crowded church every Sabbath,", re- malrked Captain Tapewell, in -a singularly felicitous tone of voice.   ,       , ' "But, gentlemen', pursued' the Rev. Mr. Twirl, ' it is always dangerous to meddle with a man's pecuniary inter- ests. Wae all have our ideas as to what constitutes our lduty, an d undoubtedly brother Tims has his. At all events, I do not feel it my duty to take any special notice ,of lis continuihg in the liqumor trade. By and by, these things will takeI care of themseltes. Always remember, brethren, we have a superintending Providence, who. knows when it is best to bring about important results. We ought to pray more fortJie furtherance of great truths, anld then we shall become enlightened in due time." ' "And do you mean to say we are to sit down- and wait for a' greater revelation of divine trutl, sir?" inquired peacon Smart. "Haven't we seen enough already-?

I don't believe in such specious reasoning, sir.- Now is the time come; and ' it is high time to awake out of, our sleep.' If you will allow me to quote the same authorities you have, 'Work while the day lasts ; ' Be instant in season and or.; of' season.' Thee's my senti- ments," remarked the deacon. "Yes, brother; but remember the words' oWut of seq- son. Are we not now debating about an unseasonable thing? I repeat ic, I cannot go to Mr. Tims and say to: him,' You are about entering upon a dangerous calling" He would only be offended by such a reproof. We ought g not to forget that others - heavy pillars of our church, deacon - are equally implicated. Alen who 'pay the roundest taxes in my parish are partially or wholly en- gaged in the traffic in ardent spirits - men, too, who are in regpilar standing." 'Anld," interrupted the deacon, "men whom -we have ' covenanted to watch over and reprove, warn and rebuke, as needful occasions may arise.' I believe so runs the creed that admits to membership in our church." Parson Twirl assented to its correctness. He even added, c"A moreamiable, consistent man does not occupy a seat in my parish than brother, Tims; and so much have some of the brethren of the church been impressed with his deportment, that the vacancy of a deacon would, be offered to him by many of our best men..

They remained together in close conversation for an hour or more; and the afternoon of the following Sabbath Deacon Smart attended upon brother Babbitt's preaching. At the next church meeting, however, he was present, having understood that Mr. Twirl intended to make the subject of 'temperance the ground of special prayer. He listenedclprofoundly to the worthy gentleman's devotions, and only heard the phrases, "'that it will please thee, 0 God, to put an end to heathen superstitions and Moham- rmedan delusions, and to arrest the mighty, wide-spread effects of intemperance, that stalks broadcast over our whole land."                . As'they came out from the prayer meeting, Mrs. Play- fair remarked to Mrs. Greatwell, "she noticed brother Twirl was rather personal, with respect to brother Tims, in his devotional exercise," which caused Mrs. Greatwell to- inveigh against the absurdity of making one's daily traffic the subject of church dictation. ' For my-part," )  she continued, "I am  really thankful that I am not , troubled with such a tender conscience. What if brother Tims does sell liquor, and people get drunk after buying i   76      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, it?. I should like to know what that has to do with Dea- con Smart's conscience. And fthere's Captain Tapewell, so mighty officious in the Inattery that he told my huqband 'he' could not resist his conviction that it ought tp ,be made a subject of chllurch discipline; and brother Tims- ought to be counselled and warned, according to the iprom- ises "made in the covenant to offending memlbers.' Dear me, these straight-laced, new-fangled ideas only ten to make quarrels among the members; and, for my' part, I shall clear my skirts from all such interference." The old lady herb rapped heavily upon her snuffbox, and begged Mrs. Playfair to take a pinch. Tlhey then conversed in a low, mumbling tone, and both finally agreed to advise the leading members to beware of stirring up the coals of contention; for they. thought, WitlK Parson Twirl,." every thing-was good in its place, when not abused." Somehow it soon-became* public that all 'parties in this  church were not agreed upon the subject of temperance. Still, not a few thought it "too delicate a- subject to be meddled *with;" for there; was sister Tims, one of "the most active women in the church,-- a most remarlably  benevolent person, likewise, -cwho never shranli from any office imposed upon her; and at this present time she was president of the "Relief Sewing Circle," besides being -a regular colporter of tracts for her district, and secretary of the -'Auxiliary Branch for the Prevention of Pauper-/ ism." It was, however, accounted most uncharitable in  THE REIGNING' KING.  i     " Mrs. Smart, because she remarked, "If Mrs, Tims took ;her station upon one-of the rum hogsheads in her hus- bancl's store, she would probably record the names, resi- dences, and manner in which pauperism was induced, as it had not been previously reported." The Rev. Mr. Twirl now made it a point to converse With those members of the church "who felt it was not   - yet time for any decided expression of feeling;" and the worthy man soon after made a most rousing appeal to his congregation upon the subject of "European forms of oppression." Not a dry eye was to- be found as he de- - tailed the sufferings of little children who are made to groan and tug under such barbarous cruelties as forever cramp their physical energieS, and deform their whole moral well being; but nobody had any tears to give to those haggard, half-clad little children that were picked up from an attic chamber, where a father lay ins a horrid state of intoxication, by quaffing the contents' of a jig : whichl he had bought at brother Tims's grocery oni Satur- ' day evening.   The drunkard "was a poor, miserable wretch, who ought to be ashamed of himself;' but the sin was traced no farther. Sister Tims was so benevo- lent, that she actually provided those children with dresses, with which they appeared in the Sabbath school, looking as irespectably as others around them. Still, with all this outward expression of fellowship, both Mr. and Mrs. Tims felt often harassed in their own 7   78      UNCLE SAIM'S PALACE; OR, minds about his" traffic;" yet they endeavored to reason themselves into the belief that their temperaments were- somewhat peculiar; that they were morbidly conscien- tious; and that the sanction\of their minister and the majority of the congregation with lwhom. they associated clearly indicated there was no pressing need of being ex- cited upon the; subject. Mrs. Tims, soon after her hus- band's accession to Uncle Sam's wishes, displayed an elegant gold watch, which one of her curious neighbors ascertained was purchased by the old millionriaire for a lady, and for Which he demanded a warranty that it was "a prime particle ;" and if it proved defective, it was to be returned, and the money refunded within a specifiedA time. This was the manner in which Uncle Sam always made his bargains. He used to instruct his clerks about allowing too much " leewmay" in settling the accounts with customers, and laid great stress upon the fractional parts of a dollar.,   THE REIGNING KING.        179 CHAPT ER VII. Bachelor Sims in Love with Uncle Sam's Niece.- Fifty-Two and Seventeen. - The Bachelor renounces his favorite Practice of Smoking, at the young Lady's Command. -Her Letter to her Brother upon the, Subject of her Engagement. - What is Love? WHEN we can leave one set of friends in comfortable' quarters and in a cheerful spirit, we naturally make a call upon others. So, just now suppose we take a glance at bachelor Sims, the lawyer, office seeker, politician, and, at- this time, the lover of Miss Rosa Beals. We think, with Mrs. Godfrey, it promises to be what }he world calls a " curious match."  In the first place, is it not a little singular that living as he has, and having been thrown into the society of young ladies for over forty years, he/should all at once be caught by this simple-hearted young lady, or " child," as Uncle Sam called her? Now, who shall depict the lover of fifty-two beside the / m mere girl of seventeen?  Yet here is Sims decidedly. cautght, a victim to Cupid's sharpest arrows. He now finds it necessary to look over those old, accounts almost every evening; but it is more inviting where Rosa sits, and Uncle Sam cannot persuade him to remain in his sit- ting room beside his desk half an hour at a time.    ,80      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE,; OR, Rosa is a pert, arch -plaything; never thlought much, about beinig married; has had her mind disturbed, occa- sionally, about some beau; but he was only a clerk inl a "variety store' " inl her co unltry home, or the farmer's son who was studying for college; but she never cared muchl for 'either. She only wanted of them a "handsome val- entine," or a nice,' perfumed billetdou:, that she colld laugh over with her circle of young friends. And now. in sober earnest to look upon this old grandfather as a hus- band, why, it made her laugh--first at his -folly, next at his presumption, and last of all at the difference in their ages. But bachelor Sims had improved his outer mami aston- ishingly. After his return from Washington, the dentist furnished him with a fine set of grinders; so that no -one could sneer at hiin as not having- his " wisdom teethll cut; and since that time, Monsieur Parodi, in New York, "fresh from- Paris, had fitted to his head such a wig that it was the admiration of all his' friends. The seams were so natural, -that more than once. had a lock of ihis hair found its way most clandestinely into some'lady's pocket to whom he had been remarkablJy' attentive. His hair dresser had, likewise recommended a pair' of wtliislkers; but as they were not " classic "'in appearance, being tucked in. each corner of his mouth, the Squire decided upon his" withholding them. And then his barber insisted upon a set which were left to wainder about his high   THE REIGNING KING.       81' cheelk bones, giving him a nmost unnatural expression- which le 'also rejected, although he did not. object to a lhucge set of bristles whichtprotruded from :under his shirt collar, imagining such an appendage gave him more the- air of a fashionable man, a certain quantity of hair some- where upon the face being considered as indispensable. Then his form was faultless. He was tall, well propor- tioned, and certainly looked young for one of his age, his complexion being of a sandy hue, which by gaslight or, in cloudy weather seemed not to show any wrinkles, unless- closely approached. He always dressed neatly, wore a- high dickey and a ruffled shirt, visited in good society, and knew many generations who had preceded him upon the stage of action. ie' was not,a man of un- common endowments; had been a great meddler with politics, to the serious detriment; of his law practice; and it was thought by his friends he again held himself eligi- ble to the officeB of member of Congress, should a vacancy occur in his district. When, therefore, such a man falls- in love, the excess of his passion seems to make amends for the deferred season at which it occurs'; and if he .es- capes being branded as " afool," he may thank his betters for withholding an expression they feel to be too true. Bachelor Sims, therefore, though professedly engaged in assorting Uncle Sam's papers, had more important sulb- jects about which his mind was wholly exercised. And now a few words upon Miss Rosa Beals, 3rk e.   82  * *   UNCLE ,SAM'S PALACE; OB,  -Sims's intended partner for life. As we have already said, she had been reared in the State of Vermont;$ was w an only daughlter and a petted child, among five brothers. 1 Her training had been most delicate; for her mother (as  1 fond mothers are wont to think) imagined her incapable of much household service; and so the cherished- daug h- ter was always kept at school, where she Was carefully watched over by interested friends. Of course, therefore,  her self-reliance and independence of character had no opportunity of developing what strength lay- concealed within her. But Rosa Beals was not prepossessing in her first ap- pearance.  Phrenologically, she was tolerably propor- tioned, although deficient in the organ of adhesiveness, and almost wanting in reverence. Her face was any but a handsome one. Her forehead was rather low, anid her long black hair was so adjusted as entirely concealed her ears; her eyes were black and flashy; her nose a decided "pug? and her moutlh large, with a retreating chin, Of the qualities of her mind and heart we will hereafter judge ' as they are developed; for it seemed as if some hidden charms must have been revealed to the eyes of our friend, to account for his excessive love and desire to obtain possession of this object, that flitted before his day and, nightly'ireveries.  And the she was such a tormenting little vixen; and her old lover seemed proof against the power of long-   THlE REIGNINO elINlt.      .o established habits. And so the Ethiopian really changed his skin, and the leopard the spots of his nature. Squire Sims had been one of the most inveterate smokers. He was all saturated with smoke i 'He smoked when lie drew a deed or issued a writ; when he ad- justed an account or received a call frorma a client in his office; when he was happy,.and when he was sad; just before he ate, and just after;, and never failed to wind up the day with "a smoke." He carried a snuff- box, although his olfactories. were not impaired by the ,excessive use of the contents of the box; and he had one, other practice, which, like Uncle Sam, he imagined added to the vigor of his constitution-indulged in a very mod- -erate way.      , Rosa Beals detested smoking. She could not bear the sight of tobacco in any form; and she resolved to test her power over the bachelor by prohibiting him 'entirely from the use of the weed. I suppose it is but fair to infer that the bachelor had at this time made' some serious proposals; at any rate, they were serious in his estimation, although received with a hearty laugh, accompanied with the expression, I should look pretty to be the bride of such an old man--one who smokes himself to death, and takes snuff, and. chews, adI guzzles down-.his wine, and is only a companion for Uncle . Sam." But then there was an arch playfulness int such    84:     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE;   , expressions, half serious and half comical, which did not preclude all hope in the sanguine lover. "Now," said Rosa one evening to Mr. Sims, " unless you leave off smoking entirely, you shall never have my daguerreotype." Perhaps a greater demand upon what a man considered as essential to his comfort could not have ' been made; but how did he receive the proposal?"You will not, of course, expect me;, all at once, entirely to re- nounce the habit. It must be a gradual: process; for- your humane feelings would never require such a sacri- fice." "Yes, I do demand it entirely, at once, and for- ever," retorted the little vixen. "And, more than this, if I find you indulging yourself in the use of another cigar after I have laid the prohibition upon you, I will never be seen again in public with you, however. much I may enjoy the theatre, museum, or concert."  ) Now, to most men, such a command, from such a source, would have implied enough to withdraw all thought of ia futulre alliance, since here was a principle of obedience enforced which, in coming time, would count as a draw- back upon one's felicity.   Yet could the reader believe that the very night after all traces of -a cigar had disappeared from office and boarding house ; a refusal to smoked with old associates, and eveh to. once more indulge with Uncle Sam in 'those curling evolutions which so tranquillized the mind? A" were rigorously resisted, and in no form could Rosa Beals   THE REIGNING KING.        85 detect a violation of her enforced requirements. Cer- tainly here was a sacrifice) " all for love," such, as few can comprehend.  Itgre was a captive so completely enslaved that no form of oppression could more than equal? since to a man who, for thirty years, hals been an' habitual smoker, the resolution to renounce it costs a most painful struggle, unlike that of the man addicted to his dram, be- cause hze feels that his practice may enid in his final ruin; but what lover of the weed ever could see the criminality or sin of M-his indulgence? We are not yet sufficiently : advanced in reform to feel that one is equally heinous with -the other; and we do believe Rosa Beals only de- siredl to test her power over the6 man she had thus enslaved, she knew not how. Uncle Sam and his daughter were most amused at what they daily saw. Squire Sims had- lost much-.of his per- sonal identity just by being drawn' into the meshes of a mere child's favor; and they looked upon him as little short iof a demented subject; for Pno raillery, or gentle reproof, or sharp-- ridicule, could break the spell in which Rosa Beals held her victim. A mere boy, in his wild, enthusiastic passion, can sometimes be reasoned out of bis folly; a matured mind will listen to argument; a widower  rarely loses the entire balance of his character; but a  bachelor, almost in his dotage, yet in love for the last time, must be regarded as an essentially "used up" : .    86      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, subject. Have we not a confirmation of this. truth be- fore us?     - About this time, the flirting plaything of the old man's choice addressed a letter to one of her brothers, in reply to one she hMd received, with an interrogatory, "Is it true, sister Rosa, that you have engaged yourself to Squire Sims? Father and mother are anxious on the  subject, and desire an immediate answer;;" and here we subjoin the reply which his sister returned: - DEAR JOE: I know you are all on tiptoe about my engagement, which cousin Eunice must have informed you of, or you would never have known it until I brought the grandfather in question. bodily before you. Whether I shall ever marry hinim or not is another affair; but that I am engaged in a regular flirtation admits of no doubt. The subject, as you well know, is a pettifogging lawyer --a man something under threescore and ten, but who his all the enthusiasm of a boy of eighteen. Itis rare sport to manage him.- For example, he has been an in- ;veterate smoker; but I have laid upon himn my veto,'and tot a cigar has he touched since. A  new world, dear brother, seems opening before me.  Uncle Samn and cousin Eunice are pestering my i life out about the conquest of a bachelor; but what do I care? My ideas of a husband are rather crude but   THE REIGNING KING.        87 if one will but idolize a wife enough to indulge her in every wish, I should not be particular about his age, if he be in good standing. You would be amused, and mother would be " shocked," to see to what a pitch I carry my old beau.  I can make him just what I choose. He is passive and yield- ing; says he will live either in town or country; go, with me to as many amusements as I desire; and that I shall be, as a kind of waxen doll, as it respects all labor. This suits me exactly, as I never could endure houselhold drudgery. About his money I neither know nor care. I dare say Uncle Sam would give men a house if I wanted one, or we could board with them, or it may be we may-be stationed in Washington, as the old gentleman expects some lucrative post there. Tell father he is a democrat, having left the Whiog 6ranks. Like New Hampshire, he. goes for the present administration. I can say no more at this present time; for I am just going to have my miniature taken; and an old face is to be placed at my side. Tell mother she need not be anixious about me, since I am with experience and age; that should the dear old "fogy" be called to Washington, he will attend me home on the way, and be introduced to you all .as the "pet bachelor."  I believe they have already heard from him, as he. says   88      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE;   On, he wishes, to do the business honorably and strong. Heigh-ho! Eunice' is laughing, and, Uncle Sam says, "Tell brother Richard, your father, that I'll take good care of you and the Squire." He is at my elbow. How nice to get all one's WNants thus supplied! I Remember me to all the .girls, an& Jo- thaiam and Andrew, my ol   t country beaux. Truly your sister,  ROSA' BEALS. From the perusal of the above letter, one may easily infer what sort of a life was before our old friend; but who can tell what it is that thus obstructs his vision, "' and makes him impervious to seeing as other people do? Is the definition of love "a blind instinct"? and is there no lens through which the future may be read by its victims? Do we not sometimes see in it an ex- alted state of felicity, exerting no unnatural sway, making no false pretensions, holding out no specious baits, but simply a union of'two hearts covenanting to be mutual helpers in life's sunshine and storms? and thus the seal ' of affection does not blind them to each other's frailties, but is a bridge which safely carries them over perplexi. ties, add sminooths the rough paths of their earthly pilgrim- age. But can such'a bond exist based wholly upon earthly foundations Are there not elevating influences   -89 THE REIGNING IK[NG.  over which passion and self-interest have no supreme control?

Heart Work. FOR a time, we seem to have lost sight of Uncle Sam's Palace in the suburbs of the city; but not so had the workmen who have been busily engaged in carrying it  forward.' They hope to have it cdmpleted before mid- summer; and busy rumor says that Miss Eunice Beals has lately been addressed by a young city merchlant upon the subject of marriage.  It seems almost cruel to agitatethe subject to Uncle Sam, who lives beneath her' genial influence, and really feels that divorced froml it he could scarcely maintain a being. The gentleman in question is, however, most re- spectably connected, a young man O'f sagacity and fore- cast, but a real teetotaller, and, as such, does not so readily ingratiate himself at once into Uncle Sam's favor. Per- ' chance, however, it is a Wise ordering that, at this time, such an affair should take .place.

THE  REIGNINT G KING.      91 must be together, the palace may be first opened by the celebration of a wedding. So prophesies Mrs. Godfrey. Perhaps we ought here, in justice to Miss Eunice Beals, to make a record of her filial devotion to her widowed father. She was, indeed, -a model daughter. Sweetly did- she anticipate his every wish. Uncle Sam had his days of infirmity and pain, when hel struggled with earthly , trials, and felt it was all an enigma that he should suffer. Sometimes he became even querulous and moody; but that daughter never seemed weary in her efforts to re- move the strife within by gentle offices of love, that pal- liated every day of infirmity and pain. There was a kind look in her eye, a mild word upon her tongue, a gen- tle infiluence which, like the sunshine, seemed silently to diffuse itself about him ; and he rwas comforted, he scarce- ly knew how, and endured more patiently, because di- verted from the harbingers of death which falls to every aged man to experience. She knew all his plans; was acquainted with many of his untold griefs; knew that sometimes there was an agony of condemnation that he meted out for himself for not having lived faithful to his convictions of duty; and then she would talk to him of the attributes of mercy instead of justice, and thus soothe his worn spirit into a sweet sleep, from which he would often awake as a reinvigorated man. The world, how- ever, knew not of these depressed seasons; for filial love, truly based, never exposes the weakness of a parental   (92  e 9  UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR), heart, nor the lonely griefs which give it disquietude. There is a sacred veil thrown over such an experience by a dutiful daughter's fond and affectionate love. It was just after Uncle Sam had recovered from such a period of depression, that his daughter had succeeded in inducing him to visit his relatives in Vermont. He could now leave his business in the care of the new firmn with- out anxiety, since Tims was at its head, having overcome, apparently, his scruples respecting the justice of' engaging in the trade afresh; and Miss Eunice had so arranged her household as to fear no evil from relinquishing her* daily cares. To be sure, she was now engaged' to Mr. Blair, a young gentleman of sterling worthll, of the purest principles; and 'of unshrinking veracity; ltit how unlike the old-bachelor arid his pet were this couple! Each of them was content to walk in duty's path; and although rejoicing in the hope that their future destiny would be interwoven with each other, yet they were content to wait for' the time when they should be thus suitably commin- 'gled. Miss Eunice,'therefore, could leave her lover with- out being agonized byI the thought or feeling that a sep- aration would deprive her of all enjoyment, since in the path of duty she always found a garland of flowers which made her prompt at its call. We may now take a glance at this father and daughter among the friends and rela- r tives of his early -youth, in his - native state. They are stopping with Rosa Beals's father, Uncle Sam's only   TIIE -REIGNING KIN   . .    93 brother: and as we arc desirous to do full justice to all parties, we will narrate some of Uncle Sam's good acts, as an offset to some others, of a more questionable char- acter, which we are bound to withhold. Richard Beals, Sen., was a plain farmer. He was not, however, a man of accumulation. He had always seemed to be what we call an " unfortunate man"--'had suffered a great deal from sickness; and had brought up a family of five sons; and just at, the moment when good luck seemed' awaiting inm, the scale would turn, and, as he expressed it, "his dish was bottom upwards." Uncle Sam, it was true, had often stepped in to his relief; and the acknowledgment of a fifty dollar bill was not an in- frequent occurrence; but this being obliged to be appro- priated to either the princilpal or interest of some old standing debt, althoplgh it gave much partial relief, yet it was not like having the way cleared, and being enabled to devote this, sum to present comforts. Moreover, there was an. independent turn in Richard 'which recoiled from asking favors; ianld as this was the first visit which Uncle Sam had paid him for some years, which was of sufficient length to freely discourse upon-pecuniary needs, it is but fairL to chronicle that Uncle Sam did not, as the world uses the phrase, know exactly " how his brother stood." When, therefore, he ascertained there was a mortgage of five hundred dollars still upon his farm, Uncle Sam i once declared it-must be lifted; and when the eldest son   '94     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; ORn, suggested how, with -a small amount of cash, he could plant an orchard, and repair thel house, and put a piece upon the barn, why, his uncle told him " to go to work and do it, and send him the bills." ; It did seem, therefore, as if there never was so kind a brother, nor so benevo- lent an uncle, as this family possessed. Eunice,tlthey felt, was little short of an angel, since she evidently moved her father in these matters with a truly disinterested spirit. And, more than this, Joshua Beals, the second son, was raised from a journeyman carriage builder to a master of his trade, hired a large sliop, and while Uncle Sam, re- mained, actually rejoiced in a successful 'trade. As to Rosa, we already know she " loved Uncle Sam a great deal better than grandfather Sims: she could-not help it.'- This visit lasted a month, when Uncle Sam , and his - daughter returned home, leaving the whole village in sor- row, and many families in tears, "HTat the dear old man and Eunice had departed."  It had, too, so neutralized their impression of Uncle Sam; for they looked upon the traffic-in spirituous liquors in the St te of Vermont now as a' -most unrighteous business, little short of the slave trade, and certainly less justifiable than the Mexican war. But how were they silenced uponi the subject, wLhen the' product of this business gladdened so-many hearts.! -for poor human nature is a great turncoat, after all. But how shall I portray the extent of the old man's bounty? There was widow Waddle, with her debt discharged at   THE REIGNING KING.    .    95  the bank, now living in comfortable circumstances; there, too, was Jerry Train, Uncle Sam's third cousin, with an annuity of seventy-five dollars settled upon .him, on ac- count of his lameness; and lots of small presents to the children whose fathers and mothers he well knew, besides quietly putting into the minister's hand the sum of twenty- five dollars t 't day he attended upon his preaching. After this you L y be sure Uncle Sam was not so harshy judged. They seemed to smother all recollection of the grog shop -he kept going, to, the destruction of so many individuals; and even old Mrs. Waddle forgot the saying of her husband on his death bed, "But for Sam Beals, I should never have sold liquor, nor been made a drunkard. He has a dreadful responsibility lying at his door." In the gifts they entirely overlooked the traffic of the giver, that had sent such leanness in their families; and had ,Uncle Sam   left four times, nay, even ten times, the' amount he didfor the good of his native village, he woldd not have made amends for the curse he had entailed upon them by supplying the dram shops with liquon But most of ;the. inebriates were dead, and Uncle Sam did'not visit their graves; and so he succeeded in partially obliterating from himself the result of lhis former courses. Thus does justice sleep, and retribution suffer a suspension. That Uncle Sam, however, had not at all swerved from his former principles, we may gather from taking- a peep into his city home, where he sits in his easy chair, dis-   96   z I  UTNCLE SAM'S PALACE;. OR,^ cussing with one of ouir representatives the probable re- peal of the liqulor law. As they are both on one side, of course there is little room for debate; so,'-as they have just lighted a fresh cigar, we will listen to their self- sustaining views. "Talk' as people may," said Uncle Sam to his friend, "y pOu cannot push the question any faster- or farther than  popular opinion will- sustain us. I'm for advocating shut- ting up the small groggeries. They never pay well. Be- sides, they encourage a race of; loafers, which makes the trade unpopular, and brigs- disgrace upon the higher establishments by undiscer ing people." "Very gpod," quoth the representative. I'm of-your opinion, Mr. Beals; but there's iio reason why, if a man chooses to drink in one of our first-class 'hotels, that lihe should- be prohibited from doing so; but there is a reason why a poor loafer should not take his dram until he be- comes a reeling inebriate. Rich people, Mr. Beals, have privileges in virtue of their wealth. If you, and I choose to move inour quarter casks to our wine cellars, I would like to know wrho has a right to prohibit us; and .if we choose to offer the best of- liquor to our friends, I would- like to see the man who made the law, or helped make it, preventl us, from so doing. To be sure, there are soft- headed members enough among us, from the country who bewail the effects of intemperance. They will argue andc cry oveq their own statements, and beg for the- most   THE REIGNING KING.     '   97 stringent law that can be enacted; but they don't'know the result of what they advocate. If the very law they so plead for were executed, ten chances to one they would want it modified another session."     ! "You are -right,' Squire,' replied Uncle Sam; " that's exactly my sentiment. There is always a pack of infuri- ated chaps from the country who have a sort of envy towards capitalists; and croak over their advantages-- fellows who have besotted sons or drunkards somewhere in their families, which gives them such tender consciences. Now, if you think, sir, there is any danger from the car- rying into effect of the law, just let me have seasonable notice. I've money, Squire. There is something of a fund already reserved for fighting for our rights; and there can be more added, if necessary.

Now, Squire, what will you wasl down and digest our arguments with -Cognac, Holland, or old wine, of particular brands?" The Squire thought gin rather a warming beverage; and Uncle Sam hobbled to the bell rope, and rang for something quite as old as "Schiedam Schnapps;' and then they pledged themselves to the support of the anti- liquor law, as a panacea-for a conscience that would some- times be inquired of whether it were right, in all respects, - to -trample it under such specious reasoning.    9                *   ;   98      UNCLE -SAM S PALACE; OR, Our friends, at this time, were interrupted in their po- tations by the appearance of Mr. Blair, who had- just received telegraphic information of the death of MAr. Richard Beals, to whom we have so lately been intro- duced. This was quite a shock to Uncle Sam. It put entirely out of his mind the conversation he had just car- ried on. It made him reflect. He dismissed the repre- sentative without further instructions, and, closing the door, remained alone with his daughter.  "Daughter," said the old man, 'thiis s sudden. Dick was ten years younger than I am. He's been a hard- working man--a sincere man; yes, what people call a pious man, of tender conscience. It's a lwarning to me, Eunice, that I must sooi follow; and when I rgo, I shall leave you a large estate,child. There's ing carrying any thing with us to another, world, you know." . "Only our characters, father, that we have formed here." "( That's the rub, child. It makes me uneasy sometimes to -think I have done so little for my fellow-men. I might have helped Dick more, poor fellow, with his great family, and so uncomplaining and grateful as he always was. I shall always be glad that you encouraged me to make that last visit, and do as we did. That's a great satisfaction to me," said Uncle Sam; and as it is, I hope to meet Dick in peace in another world." "-I have no doubt of, uncle Richard's fitness for heaven," mildly remarked Eunice.   THE REIGNING KING.-        99 Nor could you doubt mine, I hope/'" said the father. "I've always done right by you, at any rate." "Yes, father, you have been one of the most indulgent of parents. I sometimes think I have had so little to con- tend with, that the force and energy which a more,trying experience gives may be wanting, to render a complete- ness to my character." "I hope you don't covet trials, to make you better. Now, there's Dick, just gone: he used to reason like you, and say,' Had life been all sunshine, as with you, Sam, I should not have been half the. man, I now am, with all my shortcomings;' for somehow, good as .he' was, he never seemed satisfied with his own righteousness ; and I o s'pose that's the case with. us all. Nobody ever, need to have envied meo,my happiness. Eunice, child, I don't have any inward peace. Sometimes I almost believe there is a devil, and that he goads and torments me. Then I, don't know as any body is happy. That law troubles me, child.'" "But, father, the result of a well-spent, life always yields some satisfaction - not, perhaps, a ground of hope on account of any merit; for our hope turns upon God's free mercy; and if we repent of our sins, you know we are assured they will be blotted out."  ; "What do you mean by repentance, child?" *'"WWhen one forsakes all known evil, and resolutely fol- lows the convictions of an enlightened conscience, father. Such are always accepted."  I  i 100     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR,  *   : '  .. . Uncle Sam felt uneasy, just here. His leg was painful. He sighed, talked about the best mode of conveyance to his brother's funeral, and added he should send an invita- tion \to Tims and his wife to accompany therm  "It is dull work, at best. No -desirable errand to bury one's lost brother," he remarlked. His daughter aided him to reflect. She soothed his pains, without an effort to quiet his conscience; for she was sensible her father was weorldly and miserly, and at- tached to a business whose effects had carried sorrow and destruction into numerous faniilies; and she would have it abandoned, if possible. Mr. Blair now entered their apartment to say that he had arranged it fol- them to start in the morning train; and, of. course, both father and daughter had no further time to pursue their conversation.   THE REIGNING KING.        101 CHAPTER IX. A Country Funeral. Richard Beals's Document, addressed to Uncle Sam. - Its thrillng Import and its Effects. 'MY friend, did you ever attend a funeral in the coun- try? From the railroad depot to uncle Richard's house was full four miles,:so that' the city. relatives wlho attended upon this occasion were forced into a jolting kind of east- off stage coach, and driven rapidly over rough roads, which had. been travelled just enough by heavily-laden teams, after severe rainstorms, to make them most un- comfortable, as they were slightly frozen, causing the horses to frequently trip, and almost throw those upon the outside seat to the roadside. Uncle Sam's gouty affection troubled him almost beyond endurance. From the top of the hill the house rose in sight. It was an old-fashioned, gable-roofed dwelling, painted a brick red; and t .long well-sweep was quite as far visible as any appendage connected with the establishment. As they approached nearer, there were all outward : signs of moving, rather than the stillness of death. A large dox wagon was laden with chairs, which were brought for the accommodation of guests- Alen and women were seen carryi g sundry baskets, and crockery,        ,   102   .  UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, ware, in every variety, shone out from ill-fitted covers or napkins that did not quite conceal the view. The front door was thoroughly blockaded with the laden teams, so that our friends were forced to alight at the end one, which necessarily carried them first into the kitchen. One of the young men. received his relatives. But what was Miss Beals's amazement when she first entered, and was met by large women and small ones, some bend- ing over a bread trough, with a: quantity of flour sufficient for a large bakery, while another was pouring cream into flour for pie crust; and a firkin of butter stood at her side, ready to be used without stint on this memorable ' occasion, as "City folks are used to rich food" was con- stantly going the rounds. Eunice stood a moment almost petrified, pretending to brush her garments and warm herself, wondering where Rosa and her mother were. Two fat men came in to in- quire, "How many fowls must be killed?"   Another brought in a round of beef, while the large overi opened and disclosed great loaves of cake, of unwieldy size. All the appearances indicated a thanksgiving, rather than a bereavement. In a few moments the widow appeared. She was calm; and although traces of grief and-care were upon her brow, yet she struggled to overcome weeping, and succeeded in doing so. She detailed to Uncle Sam and his daughter the particulars of her husband's death,   THE REIGNING KING.        103 interrupted frequently with inquiries in a half whisper, whether "more cake would be wanted," and if "neighbor Titus's tea set had arrived," &c. &c., all of which seemed to Eunice to be entirelyirrelevant to the occasion; apd she could not comprehend, the meaning. "Your brother," said Das. Beals to Uncle Sam, "was constantly expecting his summons for two years past. He knew he had a heart difficulty, which, as he used to say, made of him a' minute man;' and I think he lived in constant preparation for the event. He did, however, long to see you once more, sir, and even contemplated visiting you in your new house the coming spring. Ever after he saw you in the autumn, he grieved that he did not express to you' his convictions,' as he called them. I think he left a writing for you, which is locked up with his private papers." : Uncle Sam winced. He inquired if he looked natural, and said by and by he would like to see him, evidently desirous of turning the conversation. They were con- ducted to an adjoining room, where sat Rosa and Squire Sims. Rosa was in tears, but "transported with joy at seeing her cousin, and fell on her neck, and loaded her with kisses. Uncle Sam, too, came in for his full share; and Squire Sims was not an indifferent spectator, although : forbidden to give so personal a manifestation of his joy. The prerogative of women here is universally acknowl- edged. 5 . -:    104  .   UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, The house, however, was a scene of confusion. In the room where the dead man lay were large rolls of crape, milliners arranging bonnet trimnimings, maftua makers r measuring lengths and widths, and busy in inquiries of Eunice how they now made mourning dresses, and wheth- er any new fashions had yet appeared for sleeves, and even the width of the hem upon the widow's veil did not escape most'solicitous inquiry. In the coffin upon the table lay the earthly remains of uncle Richard. So calm, so peaceful seemed his repose, it looked like a deep sleep. The lips were slightly part- ed, the faint color seemed in them a contrast to the usual seal of death, and there was a smile which seemed to be- token his introduction to liervenly rest. Eunice and her father gazed long and earnestly upon that face. The past rose before the father. The future seemed already present, when, with a disembodied spirit, he, too should be gathered to his fathers.- Indeed, there seemed to be little time for other mourners to reflect, such continual inroads upon them were made in the Way of preparation for the burial. All was hurry, confusion, and intense excitement. Chairs were being arranged in long rows, tables were being set in due form, chambers were dusted, and beds covered -with the best of their own or neighbors' counterpanes. A hurried dinner was served, and the family were attiring themselves for the -service.   THE nEIGNINQ K IN G.       105 About this time, wagon loads of farmers, and their wives and children, began to appear. Carriages were driven into the long yard, and the horses, carefully covered with buffalo robes, stood grouped in close proximity. Some evidently came from a distance, as they brought "proven- der" for their- horses. Long before the hour for the service, the house was filled with women and children, while the men stood out- side, discoursing not upon the subject of death or immor- tality, but, rather, " how hay was selling now;" and one actually bargained for a pair of steers, that were .to be delivered the next morning. A couple of men sat on the doorsteps, " wondering if the widow Beals would let out a : . part of her pasturage another year," and ended with the remark that "so smart a woman would be married again in a year or so." just 'in front of the house was the, family burying ground.; The open grave was clearly visible from the ' front door, by the upturned earth that had been scooped \  out; yet it made -little impression upon bystanders, so long as they were not to occupy it. So they discoursed of things pertaining to the interests of this world. Is not - man a reckless being? , And how the minister has, come, and the groups begin to disperse, and come nearer the house.- The entry is black with men, the stairs are filled, and even. the win- dowp upon the outside are surrounded with sober-visaged c' '5   106     UNCLE SAi'S PALACE ; OR, persons, who greatly respected uncle 1Richard, because he was a " very clever man." A choir sing the hymn commemorating- the death of a Christian saint; a prayer follows; and then the discourse, setting forth our close relations to another state, and the ,need of a well-grounded hope to enter the realms of eter- nal blessedness, summed up with an abstract of the per- sonal character of the deceased, with a fitting eulogy upon his life and character as a citizen and Christian. A short prayer follows, and a benediction, when the mourners are all called out. in pairs from the one room they have occu- pied, and the crowd fall back, and gaze with earnest curi- osity upon the procession as it' is formed; and should there be a cousin misplaced, a record is sure to be made of it; and if one should, perchance, be omitted, t will -call forth the severest censure.' Eight plain. farmers, sterling men, bear the body to the near grave. . A circuitous route is' chosen, that the whole procession may be seen. With care the body is lowered to its final abode., Te vast procession look ijito its nar- row resting-place, and return to the h'ouse again to con- verse upon the topics that are nearest to them.   A The pall bearers stand ranged with uncovered heads at the door, ready to let the crowd pass in; then-they fol- low; and soon the loaded tables give evidence that life must, be supported by exterzal means and internal sus- tenance. One tableful, being satiated, rise, and give ...      i   l!l:        THE REIGNING KING.        107  place to another, scarcely one departing until he has "taken supper." Such is a bare outline of "a country funeral" in the villages and hamlets of the interior of our New England' States. Unclle Sam and Squire Sims were in deep conversation. Not one of the farmers knew the latter gentleman; and you may be sure a busy inquiry was made among the women to know "who Rosa Beals walked with to the grave." - The old. gentleman who wore a wig and heavy, chin bristles, and who must have beerr a relative, they never knew not one surmising he was a lover, and in- tended son-in-law. The subject uponl which Uncle Sam and Mr. Sims were conversing was uncle Richard's will, and the contents of a paper directed, "To my brother Samuel." We will -here subjoin its contents, as they give evidence of -a man true to the convictions of his own. conscience, and anxious to leave his record of the opinions adopted by him relative to engaging in a certain traffic. It begins thus:   MY DEAR BROTHER: We are most closely allied by consanguinity, and have, through a long life, enjoyed the freest interchalnge of thought and feeling upon almost all subjects; but there are one or two topics which now press upon my mind, and make me desirous of committing to paper what I have neglected to do when we have person-     108     UNCLE SAI'S PALACE; OR, ally met. H can hardly define the reason, yet with our most intimate friends we sometimes live. estranged upon our spiritual interests; and such has been the case with us. :Now, to me, who live in hourly expectation of entering into the eternal state, the soul that does no take hold of the future is an object of utter- desola- tion. Samuel, we have always lived together as if this world were our only home. We have talked exclusively of earthly pursuits; and, until within -a few years, the in- terests of time have engrossed all my concern.' Witi: small pecuniary means,; and a large, dependent-family, ] felt almost justified in toiling for " the meat that perish. eth," forgetful of the true idea which embodies a religious spirit wit" an earthly zeal and commendable prudence. - But I was arrested, I hope, in time to repent and forsake. my sins. I must be plain with you, as a dying man, and ask, ]ow stands- the matter with YOU? ' The subject of your business has long troubled me. When you first: engaged in the liquor trade, I know it was considered "reputable business." Men of integrity and sound piety were engaged in it, not suspecting the baneful effects of their profits were jeopardizing the souls of thousands of their fellow-men. But, by and by, we became enlightened upon the sub- ject, and then the destructive Tork revealed itself. Pub- lic opinion was arrested by the fact that from the holds of     1 THE REIGNING  ING.!       109 iniquity the voice of reason had begun to speak. Yes, you -know among inebriates the work of reformation- com- menced; and the lecturers who first took the work in hand were converted drunkards-a   miracle of God's providential care to stay the awful ravages of traffic in spirit uous liquors. I knew yo were -a man of good judg- ment and fair conclusions, and I looked to you as being one who would first renounce the trade. You began to see its evils. You held mortgages which could never be redeemed, because the demon held-his captives by a spell. You have seen the tears of, broken- hearted wives, and listened to the supplications of parents and children that the foul monster might be driven from our peaceful villages, as only this fiend triumphed over our prosperity; and why, O, why, my brother, did you resist your convictions, and refuse to obey the dictates of an enlightened conscience? Your wealth must be im- mense; and have I not again and again heard you ( eilo "that no business on earth was so lucrative "  How came you by those mortgages, even in our little village? When the grocer was convinced, and-almost signified his readiness to relinquish his traffic, in view of the frightful consequences, how did you laugh at his weak- ness, and deride his folly, so that, on the following week, the work we hoped we had accomplished was nullified! People found they could drink slyly; and the habit was so strong that it was net resisted, because the temptation    O 110    UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, l lay still before them. Poor Nelly Twing, how my heart ached for her! Captain Bellows, too, and Squire Short, nd Judge Ramsay--all in drulkards' graves, wliHo might :, have been excellent, as well as ejminent, men, but fhat'yo, i?1: and people in similar business, furnished them withl the:i i: means of self-destruction.    .  My dear brother, it is with great pain I allude to these things; but you have a conscience, and I fear, unless it --:: be stirred by such remembrances, you 'will be silenced when judged by that higher Tribunal that looks with jus- [ : tice, as well as mercy, upon erring 'men. Your reclnt  efforts to break down the law regulating the traffic in ar- dent spirits met my hearty disapprobation. Men grieved over it, and men triumphed in it, just as they were in-  ^ clined. Your assertions that "you would pour lout money like water to repeal such a law," your efforts to bribe   Svo er-s and your willingness to procure bail for offenders, . qH ecome as household words among us, which I fear -  can never be erased in this state. It has brought you -to - be viewed with mingled pity and odium.          - I have heard you quoted as the. apostle of anti-tenm- i; perance- such a misnomer! as the friend of the liquor I  vender, and the man who refused to be convicted by   : legal' or moral suasion; and my heart, has sunk within  i me, that you were the song of the drunkard. Yes, that   you openly trampled upon legal enactments--not that    :: you directly helped the reeling inebriate, but that upon   i   ^    THE REIGNING KWING.      I the foundation of your wealth stood pipes, and butts, and quarter casks, whose contents did the deadly work. Now, my brother, as "by this. craft you have gotten your wealth,'"I beseech of .you to now abandon it, and make what reparation lies in your power to iancel the accu- mulated guilt, and become to the wrld a converted, penitent man, as you hope for acceptance hereafter. These lines have been penned as if the light from eter- nity dictated them. I, hope to meet you in :peace in :that world where the accumulations of earthly traffic enter not; but only the characters which have resulted from- finite labors will prepare us for the mansions best adapted to our enjoy- D mentf there. H know you will review your course, anda bitterly mourn over your folly. I thanrkl you for your many expressions of love to me; and this is the only re- quital I can give -even a desire to bless you forever Your brother        RICHARDS --- Squire Sims read the above, in a somewhat inaudible tone, to Uncle Sam, in a private room. The old man became tremulous, but struggled through with hearing the whole contents, and then: held his- head in his handker- chief, andwept like a child. The "will' was next brought up. e It was a most dis- creet document, and made some bequests' against which the law did not provide, all evincing a well-balanced    "2-     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; Oe, judgment, and showing the conscientious man in every relation. Uncle Sam was most tenderly touched, and Squire. Sims would have been more affected had not that mere plaything of a -child, Rosa, so fully excluded all other thoughts. In the mean tdime, Eunice Beals and Rosa had been holding a private consultation. Rosa declared to her cousin " that she would never marry the old lawyer; that she would sooner die than throw herself away;" and that she had, in part, given him to understand so; but jove is blind, and the old bachelor believed all women were " coy, and hard to please,' and did not realize upon what a pre- carious footing his future happiness, with respect to Rosa, ,was now held. She was a creature, of excitement, loved attention, admired to flirt, and really had come to enjoy the idea of being loved, without giving a requital, until Squire Sims, between his propensity for office seelking and his enigagement, seemed to be much changed, and almost half crazed upon some subjects. He had left a 'fair busi- ness at home, and accepted, for a short time, quite an ineligible post at Washington, hoping it might prepare the way for higher advancement. So"Uncle Sam's old ac- Counts were deferred an examination until future disclo- sures should write victory or'defeat against his name.  : .  Rosa Beals, therefore, lethim again depart, and prom- ised to be to him a faithful-correspondent, so that his hope in this quarter was not checked; and he lived and    X          TTHE REIGNING KING.       113 loved as if a fresh existence, a May day, were about to dawn upon him.  Uncle Sam had a restless night following upo0 reading that document. He rose several times, and by the pale moonlight he could look out upon his, brother's grave, while an unused hearse, which the sextof had brought and left in the yard, was another object which met his gaze. He never told his thoughts; but we can conceive how a-disquieted man would reason, half resolved to obey his convictions, yet what we call the remains of "old Adam "' still. cleaving to him.' At all events, he resolved to return home, and early directed his daughter to make' such provision for his brother's family as was compatible with her judgment; and, as usual, she was most Diunifi- cent in the bestowal of presents. They soon after took their leave, Uncle Sam being too ill to remain longer without: medical advice. On his way home he fainted in the cars, and was with difficuity con- veyed thither, so great and sudden was his prostration. His daughter, however, understood his disease to be in- duced by mental excitement, and accordingly carried him to his quiet chamber, administered an anodyne, and, after a gentle slumber, sent for Mr. Tims upon business traians- actions, who could not be their attendant at' the, funeral on account of the " press of engagements."  Mr. Tims gave a most flattering account of the extent of his sales; of the almost certainty of repealing the 10*    s \          . -              0 - 114    ,UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, liquor law, of heavy orders to supply the country trade, and of the brisk demand for their importationis, being con- sidered more unadulterated articles than were commonly found. Tims talked like a- man who' never had a misgiving upon the subject. He 'seemed delighted with his rapid gains, and altogether a perfect verification of Dame God- frey's prophecy, "that India rubber cnsciences are ex- ceedingly elastic." At this visit Uncle Sam presented Tims with a building spot contiguous to his own grounds, so that in his palace he might look out upon neighbors with whom he was inti- mately connected. The recent trial of bereavement, the dying appeal of his brother, the inward convictions of a violated con. science, were all suppressed; and the old man again clutched at his treasures, gloried in his power, and thought it Would be time enough to repent, since he seemed to have quite a renewed lease of life yet unexpired, in which ohe somehow wanted to live on as he had lived, without being forever'harassed upon this subject pf" right and duty."'   I    .   THE REIGNING KING.        IS I *   *      CHAPTER      X. R ,  i  Uncle Sam's Compunctions. - His Desire to retire from the Busi- ness. - Blair's Character as a thoroughly Temperance Man. - A Glance at the Palace, - Trials of Members. - Impressions of Memory.  WHOEVER builds a house in the country must expect to niake sundry alterations therein, unless he personally superintends the work. Even then he will- often find- an afterthought that indicated a want of forecast. Uncle Sam, however, had early secured the services of an architect, who draughted a variety of models; and that chosen by Miss Eunice was pronounced the most perfect, and of exquisite symmetrical proportions. Mr. Dash, the architect, was desirous of cancelling a mortgage, by some engagement in his profession, which Uncle Sam held upon a cottage and a few acres of land in the neigh!borhod of f  projected palace; and he ex- pected a remuneration which would about mtake them square, should he prove himself a successful planner. So, with a double set of motives, he undoubtedly tried to fur- nish the best specimen.       - Dash, it seems, had been an improvident fellow, and-' was once a partner in a liquor firm., Of course, his main     indebtedness was to Uncle Sam, who, after examining the accounts, finding Dash in a sad predicament, witih a. cot- tage unpaid for, and a lot of land designed to speculate upon, his tender mercies immediately suggested a mort. gage -; and giving him a chance to study the principles of architecture with a distinguished designer, he helped him out of his dilemma by giving him a new occupation, for which he seemed fitted by nature. He then employed him, and really was desirous to secure his future pros- perity. Uncle Sam was not a bad mea altogether. He hadonot a crabbed disposition, on the whole. He neveri felt ill used only when he was perplexed upon the subject of his business calling. :  His religion seemed to be baed upon some good deal- ings with his fellow-muen, and his hope of heaven was made dependent upon some acts of mercy. Hle tried to overlook or blot out some misgivings which sometimes haunted him, about laying the foundation of destruction for multitudes. Very pious tmen had trodden the way before him'-if they were unenlightened, why :should her seek to ferret out his responsibilities? In sleepless nights, however, that "document"Which his brother Richard left would haunt him. Something almost like spectral illusions wtould rise before him, and Richard would seem to appear bodily, and, with a look of entreaty, bid him heed his words.   "7   I   But then -a bright morning, and the presence of his daughter, a walk totfihe store, ,and a conversation with men of his ownv stamp, made him feel he was a foolish man to permit such idle phantoms to disturb his brain. He wondered l1"how in his soul they ever got there." Perhaps -he hated to acknowledge the fact- perhaps he was getting old, and debility was the cause. At any rate, spring, was now opening, and' upon the first day of May he expected to remove to his palace. - In- the mean time, he was talking about retiring from business - a thing which was most strenuously urged by Mr. Blair, his intended son-in-law, who, as we have some- where remarked, was a genuine teetotaller, and, as such, had operated much upon Miss Eunice's conscience, in  leading her to adopt conclusions entirely in keeping with his own; for to a mind unbiased by interest, devoid of love of the article, and disposed to see things as they are, no cogent argruments are necessary to show the system of trade as nefarious, detrimental to our highest interests, and. a nuisance to the well being of society. But Mr. Blair was not an infuriated zealot, who could only see thllrough one medium. He was conversant with society, and knew the struggles of many who sought to compromise their interests with the principles of right; and in a few cases he had witnessed a manly surrender. He had a hope that he;should yet, by gentle means, oper-. ate upon Uncle Sam.   I    .  118      UNCLE SAMX'S PALACE; OR,  Just at this time, a severe contest and many angry de- bates in public and private were going on. Offenders against the law were tried and discllarged, having paid a fine when fully convicted. 'Mitigating evidence, however, often softened the severity of the sentence; and there. was, on the whole, nothing to prevent the enemies of the law from pursuing their business, but with an aggravated sense that a portion of their fellow-men desired to abridge their rights. The "constitutionality of the law" was now agitated in all circles. It was made a subject of judicial investi- :gation, and pronounced unjust, and illegal. Uncle Sam became infuriated; demanded to know what more was needed than such a judicial decision; while Blair could account for different opinions upon the same subject, with- out throwing a man overboard, when he solemnly stated that such was his candid belief; after long and earnest in-I vestigation. There were, however, many heated enthusi-  asts whose blood boiled with resentment at the decree. But why take the sword of justice, and brandish it, as you now interpret things? Wait a little, and errors will be rectified. Popular opinion does not seek a redress quite yet. - A violent storm will uproot the most viluable trees: a gentle rain will fertilize them, and cause them to spring into fresh vigor., If we have a law  that is not: constitutional, let- us frame one that is so. It would be strange if there were no imperfections in our first attempts;   Our legislators must doubly guard the loopholes and crev- ices, so that morality, law, and popular opinion may all fi- nally concur. That day is advancing; andh the. conscious- nless of its dawn was so apprehended by Uncle Sam, that it kept him constantly in a state of turmoil. To support his opinion, and maintain the reputation of his traffic, he availed himself of all sorts of help on his own side. He found learned men and judicial men, emi- nent statesmen and profound lawyers, who advocated a violation of the law because it was an unsound one; and sometimes he almost fancied he: was doing, God service :y his strenuous- opposition. But then there was the calm, dispassionate Blair, who could reason all his sophistry out of him ; and although he was a most worthy man, yet he- wished sometimes his daughter had never thought of him. as a husband.                ' * Blair, to-do him full justice, was a most consistent man. He was a model for all who strictly advocate the temper- ance reform. He never. pronounced- a harsh judgment; never talked about, the supreme tribunal of justice as being pledged to support a lie," but continually endeav- ored so to elucidate the truthb that conviction was an in- evitable consequence. Uncle- Sam could support no argu- ment with him; and so he shunned the subject when he saw tie man. l,       . .     . We will now taiee a glance at the palace in the suburbs, which was being carried forward upon the profits of'the   120.     UNCLE' SAM'S PALACE; OR, "reputable business" about wh'ch we have been speak- ing. No expense is spared to, make it a splendid affair.  Why should there be, when sych a fortune has been amassed by its owner? Yet; Uncle Sam has betrayed no want of shrewdness in the selection of his wolkmen. The master builder, next to the architect, is indebted to him on account of. his father's profligacy. There is a mortgage here. The man employed upon the -" stucco work" owes a large bill for sundry " quarter casks ;" but let that pass.' ,If they but work out their debts, and incur no future ones, we will not criminate them; for Uncle Sam did not; no, never; and they every one spoke well b him but one "olid fogy"' who painted in fresco. No matter what he said. "iHe drank more than he ought to," Uncle Sam had told him so; for."he mortally hated a downright drunkard." The palace began now to be the wonder of the admir- ing throngs who came to see it. Its marble floors and' - gilded panel work, 'its finished walls of glassy smoothness, its painted decorations; and, indeed, all its magnificent arrangements, 'ecame an object for some to envy and -others to admire, since suce a finished-abode was not to -be 'found in the suburbs of the city. Added to all the inte- ri-or finish, for two years past the hand of improvement had been laid upon the natural beauty surrounding the -dwelling. A territory of thirty acres was enclosed within the lot.    THE 1 EIGIING KING.       121 A sort of playful fancy had presided over its former pos- sessor, and 'the care of a florist was made conspicuous. Besides, there was a splendid grapery; and Eunice had just caused a summer house to be erected. at the foot of tIe garden, which was to'be filled with the rarest exotics, and to be committed to the care of a renowned horticul- turist and florist. The lawn in front of the house was smooth and 'grassy, while circuitous windings of gravelly depths, bordered with box, intermingled with fir trees, gave a cham to the vision of'unequalled beauty.

A German agriculturist and his wife were already en- gaged to superintend the farming operations. Uncle Sam was now contracting for various new vehicles; and while his mind was thus occupied, his health seemed improyed; i and he then counted upon many years of enjoyment in his new home, where he could review the past; and a vague consciousness flitted over him that he should be- come a 'good man, and go to heaven at last; for look at himself as he would, he did not feel prepared!o leave this world just at present.

Just at the further end of the thirty-acre lot, there is the foundation. of a house beings erected by Mr. TTims. ,Directly in front is' the, residence of Mr. Tasso, another eminent liquor dealer, now retired from the trade, with a close mouth upon the subject. In yonder little farm house is the residence of a clerk,;in the employ of Tims & Co., who married unwisely, before his, means were commensurate with his ideas of supporting a family. Just down that grassy lane lives Mr. Tape, of the firm of Tape, Boadkin, & Co., who are heavy importers of dry' goods. This man gives oyster suppers, and his guests are fond of the best brands of champagne. Beyond him, a few' steps, is Mr. Jeremiah Grumbler, his name being a singular coincidence with his conversation, which gener- ally runs upon C" excessive taxation ahd the extravagrrance of the times." The old man holds people by the button, and tells, " what the rising generation are coming to;" ' says his boys, spend more in a month than he should in a year; that his property will not descend to the third generation; and " women folks " are no 'better than men nowadays; for importing silks and satins has sent   '               v 123 THE RE IGNING KING. all the specie out of the c untry,; and this accounts for the hard times we hear abo t once in three or four years.

The village is distinguished for its Health; yet it is hard work to support these three ministers, and give them a comfortable living. Mr. Grazewell has the most fashionable attendants, however; and, of course,; Uncle Sam will enlist under his banner. Hle is what is termed a moderate Calvinist; never discusses knotty points; but his late position in regard to: the temperance, cause has disaffected one or two leading men in his parish. He is a sort of non-committal man; remarks "that popular opinion is not yet ripe for any definite action; "thinks the Maine liquor law altogether too stringent an affair; "does not believe it is expedient to legislate upon the subject;" never provokes an angry discussion; never de- nies to his flock the privilege of taking a glass of. wine, and has had " some serious doubts whether longevity is not promoted by using spirituous liquors with modera- -tion." IlHe is not prepared, at any rate, to discuss the question, A few leading men are utterly opposed to this view; but Uncle Sam is likely to prove a stronger pillar than all the seceders in upholding his doctrines. He has already placed a new organ in the church, put'his name on the subscription list for any- delinquency upon the pay   124     UNCLE SA3I'S PALACE; OR, roll; and, of course,: Lr. Grazewell is not open to further convictions. The seceders have mostly gone over to the advocates of the temperance cause, and the little com- , unity is every day becoming more agitated upon the subject. A great many in Mr. Grazewell's parish are desirous of hearing both sides of the question; and this often wakes up the slumbering consciences who are not blinded by self-interest, and with them it is becoming a serious question whether their pastor ought not to be a i'bold defender of the cause. Uncle, Sam, therefore, is likely to he an important personage when he is fairly set- tled among them. In that city home, however, there is a great work going on. The preparations for Miss Eunice's wedding are rapidly advancing Is it not one pleasant feature, in ex- pending such wealth, that workmen and workwomen are thus employed, who, but for such outfits, would find their time idly hanging upon them? Tixe palace and the home are: employing laborers without stint, and many a dollar finds its way slyly into the :pockets .of seamstresses, of: which no one but the doribr and those she benefits are in- formed. The old-fashioned- maxim) that " we should not do evil that good may follow," is mitigated in our day; and we almost overlook some slight deviations from duty, when the results conduce so nruch to the welfare of our fellow-men. Does the eye of Omniscience thus judge? Since the legislature has been in session, almost every   THE  REIGNING KING.       120 evening a secret committee have ,Waitedupon Uncle Sam to report the proceedings. The city members are bound to protect his rights. They were carefully selected, and every man's honor is pledged not to prove traitorous to his cause. But those old, stiff country members have a ma- jority. Some of them look as if they might be reasoned into the inexpediency, of enforcing the law now under consideration; but they are giants in firmness -old oaks, that vill not be uptorn bf tempests. They have seen practical results, and knowif the law were but enforced 'how much more peaceful homes and happy townships they should enjoy. There are scores of members in yonder chamber. There are pledged men; but, of course, varying in tal- ents, in zeal, and in argumentative reasoning. The mi- nority are keen, sighted; and some predict that Deacon Titus Pully and Squire Southwell might be bought off or compromised with, so that the workings of the law would be hindered. At private meetings in the lobbies such questions are agitated. One bold member asserts he is not afraid to try their metal. He accordingly proposes that a supper shall be given, where wine shall be intro- duced so as to cause no offence, leaving it optional with each guest whether or not he partakes of it. The mem- bers invited attend. Towards the close of tie evening, wine is brought in; and the Deacon and the Squire at! once make ,a motion to adjourn.

They may look heavy eyed; they may seem outwardly indifferent; but a lion is in their hearts, and a beer and dram shop in 'their neighborhoods at home. A son has yielded to the fatal seduction; a brother has fallen a prey; pauperism lhas increased their taxes, and the sale of liquor caused the pauperism.  There ae' bloated men in their towns. There is a gam- bling saloon there. There are traps to decoy the unwary; and think iyou these soser" men, who were selected with especial care to protect- them against such evils, would recklessly abandon their convictions of duty? No; they would fight a battle, and be ready to fall as victims in the cause, rather than betray it; so there is no longer; any hope indulged by secret committees. They cannot bear even the word " modification." Their settled convictions are, that the evil must be cut downlwholly, entirely. Nob law is stringent enough that does not produce such a re- suit. Truly, they have gone ahead of "popular opinion." Uncle Sam's'conscience has been sleeping more calmly, of late. His intercourse with those of his own craft; his constant efforts to bring himself into an undisturbed posi- tion; his vague conclusions, that, after all, his nervous temperament has made his business appear a more for- midable foe to the well being df society, have materially brought him into a kind of tranquil enjoyment. He wonders how he ever came to be so perplexed ; why   images of the past ever rose before him; and he palliates it all by reflecting, if people will ruin themselves, another is not responsible for their work. Yet, after all, a half- enlightened conscience is sometimes a tremendous accuser. There may be only light enough through the, smallest crevices to discover the foul blemishes--only gleams through little chinks which cannot be plastered up and made incapable of future gaps; yet what we have dis- covered will not be obliterated, and what once was la- belled " sin and transgression" cannot be annihilated., It may be temporarily covered; but in those deep chambers where Memory keeps a station, and when we dwell in the -most apparent security, she will rise unbidden, and force her way though old associations, and bring out such vivid pictures, that no daguerreotypist can draw more accurate figures; and, more than all, they are always transcribed on a metal that forever retains its impression. Does not this show us the importance of impressing suitable images i-  -those that will sinile upon us in our solitude, and when they stand out before us will be as pleasant companions, whom we shall welcome and delight to keep with us? Now, Uncle Sam. could not rouse such images; and, therefore, ihis socity, when alone, was not filled with wel- come guests. They were inquisitive, dictatorial, and de- manfded to be heard; and he could not make them obey his bidding, and, in one loud note, bid them begone, and   128     UNCLE SAM'S :PALACE; On,          . . they would flee. Is it not wonderful, considering the mandates we cannot control after transgression, that we do not more firmly resist the sins which present such grim visages before us? for our power lies in being able to give them pleasant, features and a lovely exterior,/that, like sweet dreams we would fain linger long in their enchant, ments. e-   THE REIGNING KING.        1.29 CHAPTER XI. Uncle Sam's Connection with Captain Wilby. - Spiritual Rap- pings, - U1ncle Sam's Disquietude, - His Settlement with Widow Wilby.            ,   .      ,  YEARS ago, Uncle Sam was connected in navigation with onli Captain Bartholomew Wilby. He made maniy prospcrT'3$i voyages, and brought home safely an unadul- tertc t  d cargo of liquors, a part of the profits being his olrn perquisite, they being joint owners of the ship "Fly.- ing WAitch," that sailed from New, York. 'For years, this tirade was successfully carried on. At length, Captain Wilby fell a prey to the indulgence of his appetite, for choice liquors; and  long after he was unfitted tp com- mnand, he still acted in that capacity, being the rightful owner of nearly one half the ship in which he sailed. 0 Captain Wilby, at last, wrecked his vessel, and, it was supposed, perished himself in a state of intoxication. So likewise did the mate and a part of the crew, while a few of the more hardy sailors were picked up  in a starving condition, and they only could furnish a deseiaption of the awful scene. which they encountered. At the time, there were circumstances which terribly harrowed Uncle Sam's -sirits, and exposed him to much mental suffering. The ship was insured; but there was a    lawsuit irn   ISO  -   UNCLE $SAM'S PALACE; OR, recovering the amount. The pi'oceeds were all intrusted to Uncle Sam's keeping; and lie disbursed to the widow just what lie pleased, leaving a large margin fobr the settle- -ment, of sundry accounts of which he alone could have cognizance, as nobody else was conversant with Captain Wilby's affairs.  ) There was some hard -talk about Uncle Sam, which men past the meridian of life now recollect to have heard then expressed; but time so deadens our consciousness about dates and events which do not materially affect us, that noblody could furnish any particulars of their transactions. The widow 4Wilby was reported to be left " well off," and educated her two sons at college. They never fol- lowed a profession; but; probably impressed with the idea that " money enough" would last forever, let themh expend it as they might, one, of them, indulged early in convivial pleasures, and finally coveted the wine cup to his ruin.    ,               -  The otherwas a young m all of rare promise.  He wns graceful and accomplished; but alas! he ttumed his tal- ents to no account. He, too, joined in midnight revels, and became a debauchee of most revolting aspect. So- ciety was partly responsible for their downfall! Their father died when they were young. They were ieputed to be heirsf a largesproperty. The necessity for them to labor seemed abridged; and unreflecting peo- ple always urged thit it was no consequence whether or- \ ,  f   THrE REIGNING KING.       131 not they workled, as they were athundantly provided for, thus putting our efforts to labor entirely upon the ground of earning a subsistence, never once suggesting the great law of accountability which reelons with us for the non- fitlfilmient of obedience. Theright to be idle seems ques- tioifed with few of our species, if one has paid, rand can pay, all Ais obligations, defrauds no one, and has endugh in prospect .to carry himself and  family comfortably -through- this life. It is a most obnoxious doctrine, sap- ping the fountain head of all progress, and demoraliz- ing the head and heart of its advocates. Why. should  a hard necessity be the only school in which the lofty   '- intellect canll be developed? Why. should not the aids which a kind Providence so often lends be auxiliaries to conduce to our advancement, inasmuch as the thorny and -rough pathway for them is made smoother and more ac- cessible? Or is the struggle such a help to the develop. ment of our active energies) that such a training is neces- sary to give strength to the character, and a resolution to the -will? If so, why, then, O parent, do you " labor, and tug, and  strive" to amass for your children, to become thus enervated by   your toils?  Had the Wilbys been subjected to a  rigid discipline, undoubtedly they would !lave become  more worthy members of the community, ;vhile, as it was, they were feeble, inefficient cumberers of ,he ground, and eventually profliate young men, "who vasted their substance in riotous living."   -132 ^    UNCLE SAM'S PALA'CE,; OR, Mrs. Wilby was now reduced to a mere pittance; and, in her straits, She Was determined to make a visit to her old friend, Uncle Sam; and singularly enough did she detail how she was induced to do so. She had resided, for some months past, in a neighborhood where "spiritual rappings" were agitating the whole people. It was cur- rently reported that the widow herselfl'was not only a believer, but an actual medium. She affirmed, in some of her hallucinations, the spirit of her husband had told her to make this visit to Uncle Sam, and by demanding of him the surplus Which the underwriters paid him as insurance money on the wrecked ship and cargo, she could eke "out enough for"a more comfortable living. Besides, the medium had many eacrthly aids in the ef- A feets which her husband 'had left in the form of letters, and minute accounts of certain transactions which Uncle Sam had graphically described in epistles to his old friend, all of which were outlawed as far as collection was con- cerned. Still, they were remarkable helps to bring out the sentiments from the spirit land. Uncle Sam wel- comed the' widow of his old friend,l and had many com- fortable sittings with her, in discussing by-gone' days. The first evening of which we would make, particular mention was stormy.  It rained in torrents, and the wind blew most furiously. The lights burned -dimly in -the city streets, and' carriages, with fleet horses, were ready to dispose of their passengers. The storm beat ! ,       '   THE' REIGNING KING.       133 more and more furiously, and heavy, moaning gusts of wind ,came from the chimney. Uncle Sam and the widow ,Wilby sat alone, Mr. Blair and Eunice were at a neighboring party, and the domes- tics had retired for the night. The conversation between' the two turned upon the fatal, shipwreck. The widow had just been reading to him some of the wonderful sto- ries related of Captain Kidd. Her mind had been for some time disturbed about the probabilities of the fate of  . Sir John Franklin. She really believed both himself and his crew were enclosed in an iceberg. She, therefore, denounced thie Arctic expedition in no measured terms, protesting she believed only a vague curiosity to explore unknown and untracked regions had instigated those who had professedly gone in the humane -search for a missing crew. Uncle Sam had Xthought seriously of bestowing something upon this enterprise; but his attention was diverted therefrom, lest it should prove a humbug. While thus conversing, suddenly the centre table moved. Uncle Sam looked at the widow, and she fixed her gaze on him. One, two, three distinct raps were heard. Uncle Sam turned deadly pale, but remained perfectly motionless. The widow JWilby remarked the " spirits" were about to make a "mnanifestation," and it behooved them to heat their report from the spiritual world. "Mr., Beals," pur- sued she, " we must obey their -dictates; anid it is neces- sary that you should put your hands flat upon this table." 12   134     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE $ OR, Dimly over Uncle Sam's vision rose thos6 old spectral ' illusions of former days. Witchcraft, and Cotton Math- ler's account of it, indistinctly floated before him. Perhaps -his hair stood on end. At all events, his limbs . quivered, and pain forsook his gouty leg. A cold per- spiration seized him, and he dared not articulate save as the widow commanded. "Inquire," said she, "for your guardian angel." He did so; and the letters of the' al- phabet formed themselves into "Mary Cordelia Beals," his departed wife's name. "Ask her if she is ready to reveal herself by writing what concerns your well being." He did so. Never was there a more passive subject than Uncle Sam. Paper was now furnished, and the spirit purported fo draught the following letter, which the medium transcribed. It ran thus:- "I come to lay open the past. Do you remember your acts of injustice? Nelly Twing was sent unprepared into eternity,- and you were the agent of her downfall. Judge Cramer bids you remember the circumstances of his mnort- gage. A whole host are beseeching me to lay before you ' their destructive end, which was caused by your advice that they should- persist in .the traffic in ardent spirits. Your brother Richard-speaks of lis ' document;' -and, finally, the shade of your departed Mary sums up all in the Awords, ' Beware-and refrain,' having done frill justice to that. wrecked crew, and provided for the widow in her 'need."   *                S    ;   THE REIGNING' KING.       135 After putting the letters which the spirit rapped out together, it was made to read as we have detailed. If - spiritual manifestations are accounted for upon nervous prineitples, certainly, in this case, there was never a better subject to be acted upon than Uncle Sam. He was petri- fied. He was overwhelmed. He was harassed beyond mearsure. The widow Wilby seemed to him nothing less lthan a duplicate of the witch of Endor.- The table still moved, and actually danced around the room.  Yes, the veritable old, heavy mahogany centre table, that was alhways drlagged firom place to place, on account of its weight; yet it did not move the widow.  She calmly looked on, as if familiar with the arts of divination. Uncle Sam begged ah explanation. "Slhe knew nothing. It was controlled by influences which she lnew not. She was born a medium but the revelationi-was only recently made known to her." And so she minutely described mysterious deeds which .were brought to light, spiritual conferences with the dead; but- still th ere wet, no- new manifestations by which we could take cognizance of the eternal state, and almost all the developments pertained to thin-gs of this life, which a slumberinr g memory had once hidden in- dark recesses, lever to be reawakened until at the final judgment, when the soul should pass a verdict upon the hidden things of darkness. Uncle Sam had always' dreaded a trying retribution.. He would rather have given the wridow thousands -of   136     UNCLE SAM S PALACE; On, . dollars than thus to ]have :disturb6d his peace. He never did believe in "spiritual knockings;" yet, now he had heard the rappings, What must be his conClusions? He had no scientific principles- upon which to reconcile them; and as to the written page, he had entirely forgotten the old manuscripts upon which- the widow based her artful disclosures. He, therefore, hailed with joy the footsteps of his daulghter, and described to-her the painful commu- nication he had received. She- tried to smooth his fiur- rowed brow, and determ3ined to effect a settlement with the widow. Wilby, and send her anrd the enchanted table out from his presence; and havin; administered an ano- dyne, she left her father in a toleralily tranquil stAte. But when the door closed, and the lamp burned dinly, and the storm still beat on in its fury, and the wind moaned even more loudly than before - when the house seemed to be shaken by the tempest, thler6 Was a wilder and more tumuituious struggle within Uncle Samn's breast, , which warred against his peace. The rapping   of a distressed conscience is a reality. The manifestations of buried transgressions need no "me- dium" to assure us of their reawakened power.  "The document" from  his brother Richard, and the spiritual' manifestations, told no new tale. They only seemed to anticipate the judgment which Uncle Sam had hoped to postpone till a more remote period.: So he tossed in his bed, and tried to be calm; but other subjects Would not  \  * ,       ' \              .'     THE REIGNING I ING.       137 stay before him. Thoseharrowing thoughts were so fully developed, that they could not be clarmed away by any substitutes. The old man forgot his swollen and painful limb. He needed not the aid of another to assist him to rise. He was above all physical distress, so completely had the mental triumphed over the bodily -weaknesses and infirmi- ties. In a. moment, he was in his easy chair by the fire- side. We talk of an easy chair to such a disturbed con- science.- How preposterous! There, can be no ease in such frenzies of distraction. Uncle. Sam thoug!ht of Dan- icl's vision, in that great Bible which 'had lain-unopened so long upon yonder table. 'He had never read it much since his Wife died. It was- marked and scored in numer- ous places traces of where her eyes had rested, and places which indicated the impressions they had left upon her. He turned to the bookl of Daniel. He felt himself a second Belshazzar.   The hand writing on the wall, rightly interpreted, -indicated the king's temporal downfall. Thile handwritings which had been addressed to him did not predict a fall from eartlhly power or possessions. His mortgages were good securities; his funds were well in-  vested; his trade was never in a more flourishing condi- tion; only his soul tpas bankrupt. Now -a man' in this conscious condition takes no heed to comfortable chairs, nor a cheerful-looking fire. The one rankling within seems to be fed from all the fuel he looks   138     UNCLE SMr'S PALACE; OR, upon. The king's "drinking cups" rose before him; so it was manifest that the destructive agent was permitted to destroy all claims to royalty mrany centuries ago. It rose before him as an accursed thing. It sapped the foundation of all domestic peace; and he secretly wished old Nelly Twing could be recompensed in a worldly way for the hardhearted injustice he once did to her. But if he had not, would not somebody else have made her hus- band a drunkardI by supplying him with what his appe- tite craved? The bitter cold night rose before him, when he perished a victim to the fumes of alcohol which -hle had furnished ; and old Nelly's piteous moanS, that, after his death, her cows: and her cottage might be spareq to her only rent free, seemed to awaken a thrill which, at the time they werie uttered, were unheeded. Her old, tat- tered garments, her, maniacal appearance, her finger of scorn that always pointed to Uncle Sam as her destroyer, seemed to be quivering before him; and it 'Was eigl]t anzd twenty years since that finger moved.: Uncle Sam rea- soned: Had Nelly left 4iny descendants whom he could benefit, and thus neutralize, by some good deeds, his for- mer barbarities? There was a cousin Justin TXwing; but he had aided- him more recently to smuggle a-small cargo of the- liquid fire to burn up the godl res,olutions of the people in Sturbridge village, since the enactment of the law. That gave him no quietus now. In vain he sought for any atoning propitiation by which   THE REIGNING KINGh.       139 he could gloss over his iniquity. Then, worse than all, Judge Cramer rose before him--the dignified lawyer who used to adjust his accounts thirty years ago, and when the' weariness of detail in the examination of heart-rending catalogues of ruined households used to be -Washed out of sight by the free use of the same poison which caused the destruction of those over whom he was drawing mortgages, or issuing writs of attachment, leav- inrg what the law scantily provided as the woman's only unattachable property. Why did he dwell upon such by-gone transactions? HHe did not desire to do so. He did nothing but what was common, and accounted "repu- table " at the time. He did not remember any thing about ,misgfivings at that time. Truly, why did such thoughts come across him now?  And, further, the " spirit" spolke of Judge Cramer, when he became a judge. He looed bloated, and had a carbuncled face, and gouty limbs, and an "asthma," ,and a "stomach difficulty," which brandy only appeased. How many times had Uncle Sam y up the papers- he was examining with him at midnight, and let him, have a comfortable sleep before he went home to a heart-broken wife that till morning had watched for his footfall!  And when he took himself from the bench, "on account of increasing infirmities," why did he always prefer to ^  --i      .   "O   -  UNCLE SAM'S PALACE i   OR, sit in Uncle Sam's counting room to his own pleasant fire- side? What made him seem more -feeble/vWhen he went out than when he, went in?  And, when -he died--O, that' swollen wreck of a man nlow rose before Uncle Sam. :He sent, for him the night before he died; and, in viow of the awfil tribunal of justice, he assumed his former manly conversation, and deplored his own down- fall, and entrealted his friend Beals to ' desist from fur- nishing the destructive element any: longer; "for," said he, ;I we are becoming a, nation of drunkards." And Uncle Sam promised; 'landto-night that old promise,'all - blurred over by thousands of tragic scenes since it was made, rose out of soine crevice in his memory; and i there it blazed before him as if it were uttered but yes- terday.  This vision of the niglt was succeeded by a state of depression; so that when his daughter went to him in the' morning, she found ller father sitting before an exhausted fire, pale, and unwilling to be moved. Gently she parted his gray locks, and tender were the words of sympatlhy she uttered. She did not ask him the cause of his mental distress,- nor why he siglied so piteously, nor why he' wished her to address a note to Tims. She only knew a heartache caused a headache;g and sometimes when you could make a bodily ailmclent out of a mental disquietude, and a: physician is called, and attention is thus drawn to    ":' -'THE REIGNING KING.               1,41 the bodily infirmities, the mind' is sometimes partially re- lieved; and this his daughter often tried, and found the experiment successful. , Dr. Anderson was therefore called to Uncle Sam. Upon entering, the doctor remarked, "If all my pa- tients were as .hopefully attacked as yourself, how little, anxiety I should have! You are only mentally sick, sir; and such an affection of the heart can always be c&red if time is not chided too harshy for a delay. Cheer up, my good friend. Trade never looked better." Then, in a sort Of waggish manner, he inquired, "' What success in smug- gling the article, nowadays?" The doctor then detailed the arrest of a man, and the seizureof the liquor he had concealed in a couple of coffins, which, he facetiously re- marked, ' he thought was somewhat ominous 1of the final burial of the trade.", Now," said he, "Mtr.'Beals, you have smiled; and you only need to repeat and rerepeat smiling, and the recipe will work well, and effect your cure." Dr. Anderson was a temperance man; and as Mr. Tims now came in, he left his patient better than when he first entered his apartment. -The doctor knew Uncle Sam had fits of " the blues ;" but alas! /he did not kllow the causes which prodcluced them. -Tims, as we have seen, was a nervous man. He had been through the ordeal 6f conviction; yet, sirange to say, he was not converted; and now outwardly prosper- ous in worldly matters, and living constantly a road, or AY    /                 6  142     CUNCLE' SA31 S PALxACE; 0OR, being intensely excited .at home, he was putting off tis melancholy- retrospections until lhe had accumulated suffi- cient to live in ease, or; rather, until the days of torment- I ing reflections should, press upon him. Uncle Sam did not fully unburden himself to him. He feared the conse-, quences; so thatl a marked and striking policy was now clearly discernible in all his movements. 'iTims/' proceeded the old man, "long before I knew ;you, I was engaged in the importation of liquors with one Captain Wilby. He was a strange man- got drunk, Tims; drank like a fish at last; shipped with a noisy, profligate crew, but somehow for years weatflered lhe breakers, until he finally made his last voyage, wreckled the vessel, lost his life, and a part of the crew ith hiin- self; and those who were saved affirm those who were lost went down in a beastly state of intoxication.

I nlver saw why a man need to be more than slightly exhil- arated; but the ' cusses ' will keep on until .they become shameful, bloated wretches; and this happened to my old  'friend Wilby. After the wreck, I had a lawsuit to re- cover the insurance, but finally got every copper, settled with the widow, and got a full discharge. Perhaps there might be something over unaccounted for; but I never expected to hear from it again, when, behold, his widow appeared bodily before me, to demand, with interest, what is long. since outlawed. Tims, do you believe. in these   THE REIGNING KING.        143 devilish mysterious knockings?

Tims, I don't like this being brought up to judgment before one is dead. It harrows my very soul. It unmans me, and I want notliing to do with the infernal agents that Produce such results. -So I give you leave to draw two thousand dollars from our bank, and pass the same over to the widow as a present from me. In the mean time, I will speak to my daughter. My house shall be i cleared of the witch, and that old table 'shall be sent after her; for I never wish to see it dancing round my room again."    ,  Tims could not here suppress a hearty laugh as he saw how completely Uncle Sam had fallen a prey to, spiritual manifestations; but he did not see the writing, nor idid he know the cause of the harrowing of his con- science, which was anterior to all spiritual rappings. S? he promised to do as his patron requested; ;and having discussed the intense excitement upon the passage of the law, and the determination to carry into effect its stringent provisions, by seizures of every article that-was thought, to contain it,. strange as it may appear, Uncle Sam   became so nettled with the friends of the law, that his conscience was again seared; and indulging   "4     UNCLE SAM" PALACE; dOR, in those old antipathies, and being of a resolute, deter- mined spirit still, he rose from his seat, and loudly exclaimed, "Fight them, Tims. I have money. Money A is power. I will not be cowardly. The trade shall ,have one powerful advocate. Public opinion is in our favor; and go ahead, Tims.. I may yet walk into the presence of some of the secret committee before nighLt. Tires, I am an old man; but the fire has not yet all died within me."                  , And was this he conscience-stricken,' infirm old man who ordered his  aughter to summon Mr. Tims before him that morning?  Are we thus traitors to our secret, pungent convictions;? Can we become thus seared, after being, so tenderly impressed? O man; what art thou? Truly, it is a greater problem to interpret Uncle Sam than anyi, spiritual rappings." After Mr. Tims's withdrawal, the loving daughter was again by the side of her father. She noticed there was a flashing of his eye, a sort of tremulousness in his voice; and with words of gentleness and winning 0love she. ,calmed his manner, and prepared; a nutritive cordial, which, with the aid of a tranquil sleep, so composed his nervous system, that she was obliged to remonstrate against his leaving the house, to engage in those agitating discussions which were now going on in our legislative body.            .

This letter has led me to reconsider the steps I have talken. I know I am un- Worthy her attachment, and that- the old adage is true as Tever it was, that, "before securing the bird, one should buy the cage." I have never been able to accumulate "muchl beyond the demands made upon me; yet I am still vigorous, and willing to labor, provided Rosa proves true, and yet promises to become my companion for future time. I know not how nor why I am thus desperately in love; yet my peace of mind is entirely involved in the affir; and knowing as I do, sir, that yourself and daugh- ter hold an alhnost absolute sway over Rosa's thoughts and purposes, I am induced to make this appeal in my behalf, that you may persuade her that I shall be incapacitated for any manly action if she turns upon me a cold shoul- der. Miss Eunice, shall I plead in vain? The, present office I hold here is good for nothing, and the idea of future promotion is all an illusion. I have not been able to more than half meet my current ex- penses, and appear as a gentleman.  Life in Washington, to an office seeker, is a serious affair. In the hotel where I board, there are herds of imen--ay, and women, too - who are here still livingr on hope. The landlord told :ne of a gentleman and his wife, one child, and servant, who have 'occupied some of his most eligible rooms for :he last six weeks; and upon presenting. his bill, he   "8     UNCLE SA'S PALACE; ORn, begged for an extension, saying, " so fair were his pros- pects, that he could safely calculate on the issue." Yes- terday another was confirmed in the place he has so anx- iously sought. Hundreds, from all parts of the Union, are here, living upon political air, unable to defray their board bills, yet so fascinated and deluded Cby personal friends, who generally admit to them that their claims are fair and their expectations justifiable, that it' makes one sick at heart to see such cold, hypocritical feeling. A thin man, who has twitched his facial nerves into a most un- prepossessing appearance, was just now talking 'with a member with whom he had a former acquaintance. I think he said they were classmates in a southern college. That friend-pointed me to the nervous man, and said he, "If that fellow would consent to become a negro driver, his claims to be fed and clothed would be acknowledged by his employers; while Jhere he may expend his last dol- lar, and return, at last, bankrupt in purse, and hope and health, even." Thus much can an office seeker depend on personal friendship, when backed by the best of credentials. This is a dark picture; but there is little to relieve it. So I: am not the only one who has been cajoled. As I have been thus explicit, I will venture .on your clemency while I tax you with a recital of my personal pecuniary need. I am in debt-here to the amount of three hundred and seventy-five dollars, which I cannot pay. My-board has   THE REIGNING KING.        149 been only fifteen dollars, per week, the lowest rate at which a fair aspirant for office would wish to live. My tailors bill is a good deal increased by a constant attend- ance upon "levees," where kid gloves and white satin vests are universally in vogue. Mr. Beals, may I count upon your disbursing to me the sum above named? and, in return, you shall lhave my professional aid in defending offenders. The liquor law must always be a dead letter here, let it operate as- it may in the New England States. Brandy is here bought by the pipe, and wine by the cask, while old brands, of the vintage of '28 and '32, sell at enormous rates by the bottle. In the most aristocratic circles, the mention of the law causes a general expression of con- temnpt. I have spoken to my landlord of your choice im- portations, and have secured an order for a large amount, which I enclose in this letter. Remember, Miss E., that I look to you for my success in matters of the affections, the greatest trial which now, I fear, overshadows me. Hoping to receive an answer as soon as possible, I re- main truly your friend, J. SIMS. As Mr. Beals and his daughter read the above letter, the most varied expression might be seen depicted upon their countenances. In the first place, was'John Sims 13*   ; 150    UNCLE SAI'S rPALACE; OR, such a fool as to imnagine, with such prospects as he He- picted, the calm judgment and good sense of Miss Eunice would seek to dramw into the-meshes. of love and matri- mony her young cousin, without fortune, affection, or even the prospect of a competence? Did they not both lfeel (that is, the father and daughter). that when all these es- sential qualificationis were held in profusion, it was still f a very questionable matter whether true friends should sanction such an alliance? Here was an old bachelor, of the genuine stamp of "odd fellows.' Hle had never, ac- cumulated more than "he expended; and if at fifty-two years of age he was a bankrupt, what sort of an appella- ;tion 'could be appllied to him, seeking as he did the' addi- tional drawhack of a young wife who had been brought up as a petted, only daughter? Surely, the lman wtas demented. It. could not be love that. led him into this frenzied state: it must be unqualified madness., BMiss Eunice resolved upon this head to answer him most explicitly. -  As to the folly of oce seein she  as ony reuired to write according to her father's dictation. The pervert- ed taste which again led. Sims to seek political preferment, to the neglect of his professional duties, was discussed in a common-sense manner; and the gentleman in question could not but feel chagrined when he read the conclusive arguments addressed to him, " to once more return to his law practice." But that " order," how it modified Uncle   THE REIGNING KING. '      15 ' Sam's first determination! That offer 'to defend the violators of the, law," how it operated upon his generous instincts! and, strange as it may appear, Uncle Sam gave Sims leave to draw on him for the sum of tlreex hundred dollars, which enabled the gentleman to return home and visit his lady love upon the route, and, on his return, to openly avow his ,"^engagement."  Sims's old office had been closed nearly four months.. It was filled with cobwebs and dusty files of paper. Miss Eunice volunteered the services of one of her faith- ful domestics to clear away the rubbish. She went her- self, during the day, to oversee the work; -and Squire' Sims begged her to rummage a bureau drawer for a note, of hand which a client was .waiting to receive, and Whvlich was overlaid amidst a confused heap of papery. The pe- culiarities of the bachelor she thus found exp sed to her gaze. In the farther end of said drawer lay a dingy roll of parchment. It was " the family record;" and accord- ing to dates there furnished, John Sims was-in his fifty- eighthv year. An old "' diploma," much weather stained, tied itth a faded blue- ribbon, was a carefully preserved relic. An antique box lay beside it, inscribed, in almost illegible letters, From Antoinette M. Obit January 8th, 1815." A- finger ring, once some lady's precious bestowal; an unknown history of buried love in a small casket, whereon was inscribed the word ' Ashes " sundry locks of hair "Lnown only to t e keeper;"- small billet-   152     UNCLE'-SAM'S PALACE; OR, ,doux, of ancient date; a, little, finely-printed Bible, "pre- sented to John, by his mother, on leaving home, 1a06 ;" lots of rubbish, hurried into the receptacle to be safely kept, made up the remaining contents. Torn and worn coats, shirts buttonless, stockings undarned, boots unmend- ed, slippers that had lost companionship, and old hats andl leather caps graced the closet where Dinah was scrub- bing, " in a very dirty place for a gentleman's office, mis- tress." Miss Eunice sighed over such a compound of oddity and, age, of second childishness and ancient'loves, as were doubtfully indicated by those yellow papers. She pitied a man who wasted his prime in building air castles - who had outlived his early companions, every one of whom had dropped by the way, and aslied herself, Is this the fate of all bachelors? But the missing note being discovered, 1Miss Ideals returned to her home, where she found Mrs. Tims conversing with her father upon some of the news which "Madam Godfrey " had disclosed. The many munificent gifts which Uncle Sam had be-. stowed on her husband; the present of the " house lot  and watch; as we have before stated; and the services of many of the workmen which he had requited, added to another' gold watch which was bestowed, on last new' year's day, to their oldest son, and a set of mathematical- instruments to the youngest, - all these were so gratefully received, that Mrs. Tims could not but forgive Uncle Sam   THE REIGNING KING.        153 for overcoming her husband's prejudices against engaging in his present traffic; and somehow, gratitude being akin to love, she had learned herself to regard the business in a far less criminal light than formerly. They were now fast attaining to an independence in moneyed interests. Mrs. Tims had taken a new position in society; and what once struck her as wearing a false gloss and a sinful aspect gradually lost its heinousness; and as she was enabled to do a great deal more good by the power which herl wealth conferred, the traffic in ardent spirits' did not appear so very wicked, after all. She hoped, too, she had made no compromises with her conscience by assuming a new. style of splendor, and giv- ing occasional festive entertainments, where liquor was freely dispensed to her guests. ^Thie most " conscientious and genteel" people did so. The dinner party of last week was rather a noisy affair towards its close, to be sure; and when her husband helped Major Trumbull into his carriage,' and he crossed his legs stragely as he 'Walked, and Commodore Betts let the decaietr drop because his strength seemed failing, she hop d there would be no duplicate occasion when she should again witness what she had seen; and if so, she could overlook that scene.  MSrs. Tims was a reputed pious woman. She never failed being present at church meetings, and had lately doubled her subscription to "home missions," without                      .   *   154     -UNCLE SAM'S PALACE;, OR,  abating her zeal a whit in behalf of " the heathen." No- body had ever spoken to her of any worldly encroach- ments which perverted her taste or judgment.  They always thanked God that wealth flowed in to brother and sister Tims," because the ability and power to do good were so seldom commingled. Their, pastor, too, was a keen, eagle-eyed man, who always reproved professors for any known derelictions of duty yet he never failed to ask brother T. "how his trade prospered," and always spoke of the friends of the law as being " decidedly ahead of popular opinion." No one deplored the revolting as- pects of tippling shops more than this reverend gentle- man. To ease his conscience, he had preached a sermon lately-upon the causes of pauperism, and clearly traced the greater part of the misery brought upon indigent fam- ilies to frequenting the dram shops; yet to his wealthy parishioners who purchased by the butt, quarter casks, and at auctions after Ithe decease of those whose cellars were filled with bottles " labelled and cobwebbed " time out of mind, there were no reprovals. Only " those lorwr filthy dregs of society, to whom we were called to admin- ister our charities," fell into the reproach. This was the full extent to which public opinion could at present be carried. We think Deacon -Bolt expressed the sentiments of his pastor when he made the following confession in a church meeting:- 4                             .   THE REIGNING KING.        155 "Brethren and sisters," remarked he, with a tremen- dous hem, "I have been engaged in the liquor trade,'and have renouinced it for conscience' sake. Still, every body may not see the evil effects resulting from the traffic as I do. Therefore I criminate no man. To his own Master he must either stand or fall." "True, brother," faintly articulated the clergyman in the desk., "Go on, brother Bolt." "Well, as I just remarked, I criminate no man; and I ask no body of men to make restraining laws for me. I got disquieted about the; business, and having a lucrative position offered me, concluded I would avail myself of it. I am, however, as much a friend to temperance as any other man. This' is all I have to offer. I'm not used to much speaking, as all my brothers and sisters about me know. I only wished to bear my feeble testimony for the good of the cause."    . "Thank you, brother," again ejaculated the reverend gentleman. Deacon Bolt was never in such high estimation with the red-eyed members of the church before. We might make a pun out of their solemn remarks which led them to acknowledge they were most favorably impressed with his spirit.  Too many had often been powerfully im- pressed with the strength of his liquors for some years past. The hardest case of all, however, in this church, was   156     UNCLE -SAM'S PALACE; OR, that of Coleman; the retired distiller. -Iis conscience had recently become powerfully aroused upon the subject of holding property which depended on the trade by which his best dividends were made; for he was still largely an owner in the distillery at Fair Creek. The old man, for, once, had resolved " to free his mind," although his body was not upon the anxious seat. There- was an effort, evi- dently, to suppress his speech; but, after being repeatedly put down, he begged the privilege of saying a few words, premising they should be " right to the p'int." "Brethren and sisters," said he, "I have lbng been troubled about the holding of property connected with the : liquor trade., As we get enlightened, some things don't look to us as they used to. I remember the very first thoughts which made me oneasy. When we had the great mechanics' fair, where every thing that a man worked in and upon was solicited to be .put up for a show, the thought struck me it Could be a good notion to fill some clear glass bottles with specimens of different articles I had manufactured. I had, specimens of gin, whiskey, and New England a -leetle touch above all I had ever made. Well, I bottled 'em, and labelled 'em, and carried 'em to be put in the fair. The- man who received the articles, howsomdever,took me one side after I told him my arrant, and says he, Squire, I don't doubt but your specimens are very fine; but it won't do to exhibit them. Never,' said he, 'was there a drop- of liquor exhibited at any fair.   THE REIGNING KING.       157 Why, the temperance contributors would remove every article they have inserted, should we introduce your speci- mens.  "Now, I thought if, this was raly such a dark business, I would quit it; and I did so, as you all know. And lat- terly I've been thinking' about the right of investing my money in this distillery,to have it still carried on. If I'm ashamed to use my influence by giving my name, hadn't I oughter be ashamed to put my property in sich traffic? Brethren and sisters, I desire to do the right thing; and I ask your opinions and prayers upon this head." There was a dead pause. Some fans, however, flut- tered briskly, some men hemmed powerfully, and some glances were exchanged which comprehended a great deal. Finally, the reverend pastor, with outstretched arms, sol- emnly said, "Brethrer, let us pray." So Squire Cole- man was left as to hi' "unenlightened duty," not men- tioned in the prayer, a d branded as "terribly superannu- ated." But did not the old man bring out an idea which we may not have thought about? Why, if all arts and trades are represented in these industrial exhibitions, why have not the improvements in the liquor trade a place,? No one who is engaged in the traffic answers the ques- tion; and the old Squire made the right inference when he told about its being dark business; for every nook and "   158     UNCLE SAM'S. PALACE; OR, cranny of these exhibitions are accessible to light and inspection. \ In the same church, was 'Deacon Thrale, an extensive wine merchant, in "regular standing," yet unable, through infirmity, to- carry about the vessels from the altar; and there the puffy Mr3. Archer, another retired distiller, aind Mr. Coney and Mr. Blaze, all in the traffic; yet they "were all, all honorable men."  From these citadels the enemy derives -his strength; and until we force home the conviction that souls thus perilled must eventually become shipwrecked in high as well as low places, we confess our present hope flags; yet we will not become disheartened. The right is never a dangerous position to occupy, neither is -it a sandy foundation, which can be en- tirely washed away. We get inipatient for results, forget- ting, sometimes, the magnitude of the triumph we seek to achieve--unmindful, in our zeal, that this great blot upon humanity has extended to all quarters of our globe, and paralyzed talent, energy, and 'improvement; that it dark- ens all history; that conquerors of armies hlave themselves become thus conquered;$ and that even Alexander the' Great, who sighed that he had no more conquests to make, himself died from the want of self-control. Now, while such a demon has stalked over all' coun- -tries, in all ages, and when we reflect, too, upon the fasci- nating spell with which he encircles his victims, and the   THE REIGNING IKING.      .  159 mighty force of habit'; the ministry it offers to promote wealth; the allurements it furnishes to. social festivity, while it conceals its deadly poison; the temporary strengthl it imparts to some sinking spirits, although followed by a proportionate exhaustion; the anodyne it gives to a dis- tressed conscience by its inebriating forgetfulness;- the stimulus to desperation which it emboldens or creates; the stupefying tendencies which blunt our, moral percep- tions, added to its easy procurement,- I say, when, in dark days of hope deferred, we look upon the law which has so few ope'n advocates and so many violent and talented op- ponents, we do feel as if our only trust lies in the rebuke of Heavlen, which, in a way we know not, will yet clearly open before us a brighter vision; and so we hope for poor, bloated humanity still.

Uncle Sam's Dread of the Anti-Liquor Law.- A Plea for Hu- manity.- Selections, from the old Furniture before removing to the Palace.- The Opening of the Palace.--The Wed- ding, &c.  "THAT stringent Jaw," which Uncle Sam constantly affirmed "did not trouble him a jot," yet strangely occu- pied his conversation! ie often sent out for his friend, Judge Smallgrace, to talk with him about the prospect of amendment and repeal--"  whether, as it now existed, tit were strictly constitutional; and if not amended or re- pealed, what would be its results." The judge always had one ground of argument, which alone seemed to sat- isfys Uncle Sam, and that was, uzntil public opinion is changed the- law will be conparatively inefectual." But there was one other dark shade in the picture, which. Uncle Sam clearly saw; and tlat was, that public opinion was and is changing.' He carefully read the action of our sister states upon the subject, and with deep regret lamented over his native state, Vermont, whch had so unflinchingly declared herself ready to abide by the most stringent enactments.- He knew well that such an awa- kened spirit would'spread. He read in the public journals * *      .  , , e   'T'HE ll N RINlING +      ' 1 OIL of the workings of the " aine law ;i" he had accounts  from all quarters of the check to -pauperism which was thus induced; and if he had not so seared his humanity, he could not but have rejoiced that ouri degradation was in a fair way to be alleviated, if like efforts were only permitted to exist, among' us., It would have been an enigma to Uncle Sam himself to have interpreted his own conduct. He was a profess- edly law and order loving citizen; he, deprecated heavy taxation; he was always troubled if a reckless, profligate ttenant occupied one of his dwellings; and he could count over his landed property, besides his wharf and store rents, not to mientiona his dividends .from distilling estab- lishmentsand h;isextensive mortgaged property; -so that the desire to. accumulate still farther must have been a  . miserly propensity, which long habit had induced. Besides, he was an old man. We will admit that his early gains were when :the traffic was considered "re- spectable," and reputable meen engaged in it, never ques- tioning about., moral responsibilities; but now, there seem ed a demand for another course of action. Men of indomitable energy solicited the influence of those who kindled the firei .and begged of them to smother its rage, now that they were awakened by witnessing its heavy devastations; and wky did such as Uncle, Sam refuse their aid to benefit them by practice and precept? Did he really believe it was so unjust thus to prohibit the sale "'   162     UNCLE SAI'S PAiLACE; OR,  of liquor? or did he maintain a deadly hatred to those who advocated doing so? Was he fearful for the many whom he had influenced to continue in it, that, by breaking in upon their business, he should fail to secure 'all his out- standing debts? Could he not afford to sacrifice a little when others had done so much?  And, more than all, was he not anxious to leave his name upon record as hav- ing aided one of the most philanthropic enterprises of our day-which helped to rebuild men who, had ship- wrecked their property, wasted their intellects, and ruined their families, not to speak of that infinitely more mo- mentous topic, namely, who had perilled the-isouls? He, too, was on the verge of a*Vb-tion,  when the purity of motives and ag      spirit would be the, chief grounds of satis   Ani  did such a one expect that then the specious arguments of popular opinion would avail him? The vast pos- sessions he had acquired must be left, while the un- heeded cries of humanity would be reechoed in the future world.; and did he,:not know that among those ex- ccluded from the kingdom, the catalogue' had enumerated the drunkad   How did he expect to answer to his dread account?. Plainly, he was cheated by the influ- ences about him. He yielded to the sophistry which looked only at present accumulation that most shallow hope, which. affords no satisfaction beyond a few brief hours of .misnamed enjoyment. And there was that Jre   THE REIGNING KING.       163 of revenge which he' could not bear to extinguish; that love of power over which no portion of his fellow-men should gain their control; that resolve, not to surrender, because he would not be manly enough to confess to an enlighltened conscience ; anld that mean, cowardly spirit' which dares not' brave the sneers of misjudging friends, lest they should be branded as " apostates," or followers of a Pnew party, whose aims seemed always misappre- 'hended, or'placed upon sinister ground.

In no cause do we need more brave, self-denying, unflinching advocates than in the present position of the temperanpe question.   ,               ' Methinks, could the. heavy wail of misery which is every day wsrung from hearts who in various ways 'are connected'with the disastrous consequences of intemper- ance but be concentrated in one groan, it would: reverber- ate with such deafening force, that all who were startled   164     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, -by the heavy peal would, never again question the neces. sity of a law which strikes at the externination of the evil. 'Like Sinai's thunder, the affrighted people \Would be awed by'this convulsive throe from the heart of hu- manity, and we should need no' other plea to drive the enemy from his established citadel.) But alas! we have too many Ucle Sams, who are but personifications of-the evils with wlhich we 'must longer contend.

For when-we have tau   raice t that to be men this blot must be washed out from-isoeial, politi- cal, moral, and military glory, we would cheerfully retire from the contest, humbly thanking Heaven that we were permitted to ,be soldiers who fought for the rights that would redeem them from  the direst ch apter of slavery, without a claim to be pensioners, only as the plea of Mercy shall sweetly whisper, "He that converteth a soul from the error of his ways shall save his soul from death, and hide a multitude of sins." Our recompense should always "consist in right doing, and its attendant conscious- ness. Ad                   : ^ I But here we are again forced to look upon Uncle Sam: L    THE REIGNING KING   .    165 as contending with his half-awakened congcience, public ,opinion, and the law-- with the infirmities of age, and the prospect of being obliged to surrender his claims as an active merchant and a silent partner in the firm of Tims, 'Budd, & Co. His palace is nearly completed; and he is now busily engaged in preparing to enter it. There is to be-a public auction at his city residence; for his daughter is fitting her new home in a style suited to its magnifif cence, her father's wealth, and her own marriage portion. Uncle Sam accedes to all her propositions as sensible, and sound; yet he finds himself so- attached to the inani- mate objects upon which his eyes have so long rested, that, like his traffic, he hates to relinquish his hold. He is now busily engaged in selecting what he will retain, and with what he is willing to dispense. Now comes up the force of association. Old mahogany furniture, which a fashion-, able taste is about reviving, enables his daughter to decide upon keeping many things which a short time ago would have been sacrificed by the quick stroke of the auction' eer's hammer; yet there is a collection from an old house- keeper's inventory whichi modern improvements have dist carded; and were it not that there are those who adr unable to purchase the modern, we fear the cast-of furnz. ture would be itemized at a low rate. The old gentleman, however, resolves upon furnishing one room in his palace with his old effects. He cannot part wtilth at Turkey carpet upon his bed chamber. -What if $ .   166     TUNCLE SAMi'S PALACE; on,', it have no set figures, but seems woven only with refer- ence to texture and indelible 'coloring? , It is downy and gratefulI to his weary feet.

And there is that antique desk, which'opens at the top, and its supporters are drawn out from the sides. Upon that leaf how many accounts he has adjusted! and then those secret drawers; and how many deeds and mortgages that long drawer has contained! how many notes of hand and unredeemed old bank notes now lie unlooked upon and worthless in this enclosure! Then there is the central apartment, "a lock up, within a lock up, where the- silver dollars used to be deposited in' "war ti'mes," together with' some doubloons and yellow-colored eagles, upon which Mrs.- Beals used to look as her ground of security. Let come what might, no embargo 4ould make this coin worthless. O, this was a dear old friend. wie could not think of sacrificing the d(sk for that splen- did secretary, with its glossy-finish and commodious apart- ments. What if the drawers to the new article were   THE aREIGNING KING        167 lined with cedar or camphor wood.? The old ones, lined with cherry, had a greater value to Uncle Sam, although they were " shoal," and in his shutting, with sundry jerks, always rumpled his shirt collars, much to his laundress's- displeasure, who affirmed "she had no credit for smooth- ing irons." And there was the- high-post bedstead, with its faded patch curtains, made to exclude air, and make ne's sleep almost a death such as it prefigured; yet there they had ,hung, and, drawn at full corners, had Uncle Sam slept.. What cared he -for low, "Frenchified" receptacles, scarcely elevated above a ground 'o6rm, with the gaudy drapery drawen from the wall through the loophole of a fancifully devised ling? The old bedstead must be -reserved. And there, in yonder comer, stood the ponderous easy chair. We have no account that it moved by the widow Ilby's spiritual rappings. It was a highly-esteemed relic of by-gone days. The chair in which the family always sat when recovering from diseases; where many, too, in health often reclined for an afternoon nap; where the children were often deposited when babies, with their mother in the foreground, attempting to eke out a bad day's work by sewing a little while they slept. Why, this chair was worth a dozen of your modern flour barrels, scooped out so as to wedge in a spare man, and either burst in the sides of a fat one, or burst out its own slen- der cooperage.    168     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR But Uncle Sam cared not a groat for the faded drapery curtains which for years had hung at his windows, nor yet for the drawing-room furniture, which had been essentially , modernized since his marriage; but when they displayed the contents of the china closet, he eagerly clutchecld'the "two punch bowls" -one with variegated figures on glass, and the other a ponderous China one, which was a part of his wife's portion.. The old tankards, too, he would not consent should be transformed into modern sil- ver teapots. He had rather his daughter should purchase a set of silver suited to her own taste. Some of the pic- tures, too,- such as General Washington at full length, somewhat smoked-by age, and the surrender of Burgoyne, or "Bugwine," as he pronounced it, for every thing seemed to savor of. the traffic, - he ordered packed among the- reserved list. Yet formidable as were all these collected articles, the contents of the wince cellar, far, exceeded all other things. It was remarked by an opposite neighbor, that a whole week ws occupied in assorting and trucking the articles from their own store- house to the palace; and yet at the auction the sale of '0old wines exceeded more in amount than the whole fur- niture. The auction day was a bright one, and a large gath- ering assembled. Uncle Sam  was conspicubus in the crowd, being somewhat lamer than usual, from his re- cent exertion to place things in the most advaptageous   THE REIGNING KING.        169 light. He was, however, constantly annoyed by rude by- standers, who remarked, "People hadn't oughter bid on thel old millionnaire's property. It's no matter if it don't bring a cent,' and such like coarse, vulgar expressions, as often came from men whose breath evinced they-were favorably impressed with his business, if not hisfurniture. But boarding-house landladies found here a rich lot from which to replenish; and, ever after, it would be undoubt- edly transmitted that their venison blazeis, and whaffle irons, and old Canton china came from "Beals's auc- tion;" and many an old, bandaged, gouty, tremulous soaker who boarded with them could recat what -a sub- stantial old man Beals, the liquor merchant, was, -how much spirit he imported, how many home distilleries he owned, and what " an awful sight of money he made in the traffic;" for such people are wonderfully posted on suzcl matters. ' Besides, there was always a set of comical anecdotes l told, to illustrate Uncle Sam's peculiarities. It was said he always treated his customers from. a different cask from the one he sold them, it being a more mellow brand; and if, perchance, the customers sometimes inquired, when they drew the contents, from their pipes in their own cel- lars, whether there was not some mistake in those fur- nished them, Uncle Sam always told them that the purity of a certain spring of water; which flowed upon his prem- ises, so corrected the taste, that he did not wonder at their 1  .    .   170     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, inquiry. And yet going into his store, one day, unexpect- edly, he found Budd, his clerk, treating some of his best customers from the wrong quarter cask. He was heard to reprove him, as soon as they left, in no very gentle terms, adding, "You young scamp, don't you know better, after your long apprenticeship, than to. treat from the cask you sell. This," said he, pointing, to a quarter cask, "is the one to treat from: that is to sell from,'; at the same time venting his indignation upon the latter cask by a severe blow with his cane, which happening to hit a proof glass, broke it in a thousand pieces. Uncle Sam and his daughter had not yet removed from' the -city, but temporarily resided at one of our first-class hotels, where their board was undoubtedly paid in ad- vance --fr it was a tremendous labor to arrange tie pal- ace and prepare for the Wedding; iand;as it is so tiresome to narrate the process, we prefer to introduce our readers at once t? its gorgeous and fascinating splendor. Do you see that illuminated observatory, full a mile in the distance?  Do you notice how many carriages are hurrying along towards it? And there is a loud lwhistle frpm an, extra train of cars. Truly, they are all going to Uncle -Sam's  ,L hoqsewarming," and his daughter's wed- ding. The walk leading from the station to the palace is arched, and'covered with an awning, so as to be more im- pervious to wind and water should it chance it to be a rainy   THE REIGNING- KING.       171 evening; for, as one of the wags remarked, "VUncle Sam plainly shows he has a prejudice to cold water still." Truly a motley gathering is to be seen at the palace; for the invitations were extensively given, and almost uni- versally accepted. -Decrepit old men, who had not been out by moonlight for yearswere in the party. Old, re- tired merchants, who had sat in their corners because they were "stiff and rheumatizy,;" and their wives, who wore respirators in clear weather, and had not attended an evening meeting, nor been to church of an afternoon, since they could remember, resolved on making "an effort;" for they calculated their eyes would rest upon- a magnificent spectacle. Of course, there were groups and groups of the white kid -gentry--of young merchants and professional gentlemen, of -Mr. Blair's acquaintance; and, as one remarked, Miss Beals knew every body, and was so popular, that all her friends would fain attend her levee. On the whole, the village never' saw such a gath- -ering before. House servants esteemed it a particular favor to stand any where outside, content to look only upon the illuminated arched walk; and little boys and girls stood around the area in front of the dwelling, to gaze at the strange novelty. But to the invited guests the scene opened rich. The palace was fully illuminated, and ready for the inspection of all. The works of the best artisans in the country were here displayed; and some almost anticipated the splendor of the Crystal Palace,   174     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; 0p, ,which, though varying- in degree, -could -not exceed in effect the beauty which was thus circumscribed.  The drawing rooms were so tastefully, yet solightly and gracefully, furnished, that the fair possessor had no need to be extolled. There was no superabundance of fancy articles, such as modern parlors too often exhibit, Which remind one of a showy "variety store," where every thing is placed so it shall glitter most, but a judi- cious selection, so 'that every article had -a use as well as exquisite beauty. Uncle Sam stood at [the entrance of the drawing rooms, with his bandaged leg in the threshold of the large hall which ran along this wing of the building, ready to re- ceive all his friends with a hearty" grasp; and teetotallers -and genteel drinkers here freely mingled. The^:marriage ceremony being the- principal feature of the evening, all eyes in the spacious drawing rooms were turned towards the entrance door of'the bride and bridegroom. The two clergymen seemed to be waiting for their approach; for an invitation had been extended to both the village, and the city ministers., There was soon an extra rus- tling, and preceded by groomsmen and bridemaids came the happylpair. Squire John Sims and Rosa Beals stood nearest the couple about to be made one, and Mr. Blair's brother and sister ranged next.  The bride was attired in hie plainest, yet most perfect bridal dress-a  white musin frock; and the most ex-   THE REIGNING -RING.      .173 quisite moss rose bud and. orange blossoms rested upon as finely a chiselled neck as nature ever gave. She was a neat, tasteful bride, with no display of ornaments, Noth- ing but a diamond broach, which held the simple nosegay, appeared about her person; and with that sweet expres- sion of countenance, which always made her so attractive that she was pronounced beautiful, there' seemed super- added a Jthoughtful, dignified demeanor, which attracted every one's gaze. The bridegroom needs no description, as well-formed, good-looking gentlemen always wear, for full dress, rich black broadcloth, and white vests, and kids to match.                   : b We will only remark, therefore, in passing, that Squire Simus's party dress at Washington came into good service on this occasion; and Rosa Beals put on her cousin's ornaments, and equipped herself in jewelry enough for a show. case in a manufacturer's window. And then she waas so full of sport, why, she could hardly contain her- self during the solemn ceremony; and certainly no reflec- tive mind is ever disposed to be light hearted and merry while the seal is being set to :so momentous a transaction. It is to be feared, in some circles, however, that the light esteem in which marriage is coming to be held will'not be propitious to future enjoyment. Marrying merely to escape from wholesome parental bondage, that two light and inexperienced hearts and giddy heads may indulge in frivolous pleasures unrestrained, or that one may be 15'   174     MNCLE SAMsS PALACE; OR, merely the toy, like a waxen doll, upon which embellish- ments may be lavished, or, worse than all, to marry to secure "an establishment" from the hands- of a rich father, without any business qualifications, or mental re- sources at command--this is what? Is it 'not one of the follies of the age? Pardon the digression; for while we have been looking at this feature of our times, the words "man and wife " have been pronounced, and the servants are in all directions offering cake to the -guests. Wine is'  not excluded from the ceremonial accompaniments; yet we do not hear of it again at the magnificent supper table. But' there is -a "popping sound" in Uncle San's private apartment,: where his particular friends seem very much disposed-to enter. Uncle Sam had exhibited so remarkable a trait in his character, that we will make mention of it for the benefit of future' occasions. He considered Mr. Blair's position, and knewl his abhorrence to liquor in any and every form. Blair had always acted the gentleman towards him - not by any sort of compromise or, disclosure of his senti- ments, bWt by never obtruding them when he knew they would only be provocatives to anger; 'and this course had  commanded Uncle Sam's- respect; so, that, from purely courteous feelings, he withdrew every sort of liquor from the feast table, although the private room gave evidences he still maintained his large hospitality to his own party. Indeed, the old man had a merrymaking in his room;   THE  REIGNTING KING.      175 cards were introduced; games, such as gentleman play at ( club houses," followed, and ill luck here, as there, was washed down by particular brands; so that the: meeting was prolonged till a late sitting; for the extra train was ordered longr after midniPght. .  The other guests' were merry as waltzing, plays of every variety, and leaders of games could-make them, Rosa Beals being the most coquettish, roguish little hoi- den almong the party, and Sims, as usual, was looked upon as some relative who filled the gap of a delinquent, who, for unknown reasons, was missing.- We ought here to. mention that her mother, the widow. Richard Beals, and two of lhesdns were present, and conversed steadily with Sims, while his eyes were jealously turned towards Rosa and the young gentleman whose attention she so continu- ally attracted. Having a moment to spare, we will just take a peep into Uncle' Sam's apartment. It is full. The old man, however, holds an empty glass in his hand; and, as true as life, he is carrying on a discussion in the midst of all this revelry with Judgle Barnes upon the. "extended li- cense questionz.' His ruling thought must have vent; yet he is not likely to be much enlightened, as the subject has Hno sort of interest to the, judge, and only through courtesy does he lend a listening ear.  But all festive scenes have an end; and ,well it is if   17i     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; 6), the retrospect can be satisfactorily surveyed, and afford us as much pleasure as did the anticipation, The last train of cars has departed; the last carriage is waiting to take home the guests. It is a still night without, and seems in strange contrast. with many of the excited guests ho have so latelybeen surrounded by that eveirlasting buzz which the clatter of tongues occasions. Tle Babel confu- sion has ceased; and the few hours preceding the dawn of another day, we fancy, will not give repose to many sound sleepers.   THE REIGNING KING.        177" CHAPTER XIV. Life in the Palace. - Uncle Sam's Weariness and Restlessness. - Another Disaffection' and Secessio in h the Church. --Parson 9 Grazewell encouraged by Uncle Sam. UNCCLE SAM31 was a man who could never bear t,o fedl that his influence was abridged; and aJMr. and! Mrs. Blair well knew his temnperament, they were perfectly willing to accede to his proposal that he should still act as the master of the palace, as well as assert his proprietor-, ship while he lived. A change of place is generally quite enough for an aged person to survive. A change of objects, of associations, and, as it were, a new life, is, often detrimental not only to the happiness of such, but it is seldom promotive of longevity.  Mr. Blair,: therefore, early began to enact the part of a: model son-in-law. He never evinced a dictatorial spirit, nor called in question the absolute sway which his father- in-law maintained.  he was inflexible, however, in the advocacy of his own principles; and on no account would he compromise them, neither wouldhe officiously obtrude them, as is sometimes the case with inexperienced young men, when they feel ;that they have secured an enviable position. Probably the reason why so much domestic fe-. licity is abridged can be traced to the inharmonious action   j - -8 3    tUNCLE SAM'S PALACE ;.ORE of sons-in-law and daughters-inrlaw, who are too often regarded with jealous distrust; and feeling the position in which they stand, a kind of independence or turbulence - of spiritl is often manifested, which spreads discord in all the family .  It was beautiful to witness how this young couple re- solved to steer clear of such breakers. If the old gentle- man desired Mr. Blair to drive him into the city, he gen- erally made it convenient to do so. If he oddly preferred that his man should drive him, why, 3ir. Blair took the cars with equally pleasant feelings. -If a variety- of er- rands were intrusted to him, they were always performed i with alacrity and good will - not forgotten, as we some- times find the requests of old people, thinking to-morrow will do as well; for age, like childhood, is impetuous, and desirous of immediate gratification. ,   Uncle Sam, in his new home, found a great deal to su- perintend; and his many directions took up the whole- of the first days of his removal, besides receiving the many, many calls which were made on them by friends and strangers. The close proximity of the palace to the depot was  likely to prove a great convenience to many. This was very clearly made manifest; and hundreds, prompted by curiosity as much as friendship, made bridal calls of con- siderable length. There was never likely to be a day when they would lack for company. The village about               . I 8    % ,THE REIGNING KING.           179 them e, as we llave seen, was composed mainly of city peo- ple.. The heads of families, therefore; found it convenient to call in the evenings, while the younger portion per- - formed ,this piece of etiquette in the day. Mrs. Blair found she had unwisec y calculated that Ishe should find more leisure in her country residence. People excused themselves for untimely intrusion, " on account of the hours the cars ran ;" others, that they desired Ito breathe the balmy airs of spring, and so they gave Athemselves an. extra hour to do so. , Then every body wished to inspect the palace, besides perambulating over the' garden and greenhouse. ":It was so beautiful to live in the country as they lived," was one of the most common remarks  and this, too, seemed to be uttered without a conviction that very few had Uncle Sam's wealth to enable them to do so. It was supposed that. many went away quite fretted that their lot was not like IMrs. Blair's. They wondered why their fathers could not have imported liquors, and become millionnairies; for it is- to be feared the love of extravagant expenditure is becoming such an- alarming feature of our times, that the- means by which the end is attained is every year making heavy demands upon the principle of right living and the manner of accumulation. We forget ,that, to a man of Uncle Sam's wealth, the channels in. which he diverts it, by which- a refined taste is gratified, and the embellishments which adorn it, both : '  *    . .  "   .    ,  /    ^   180     T UNCLE SA 'S PALACE; ORn; externally and internally, give employment to many arti- sans,'who would otherwise pine in obscurity, and eat the bread of poverty; yet what is commepdable in a 2millionz naire can never be safely followed by those Who have only a comfortable competence; and we regret to add, the definition of this distinction often introduces imitators into a labyrinth of trouble, from which it is hard to become extricated. There were remarks, too, made by those who lhad vis- ited the palace which savored of envy; but could they but have unmasked all thie splendid gayety, and gone into the depths of disguised feeling with which Uncle Sam surveyed all its surrounding bqauties, they' would have seen little to excite their desire to exchange situations; for there was still a disquieted conscience, which would A not ,always sleep, and the infirmities of age, which would admonish him that he could carry nothing away to that country which he must soon inhabit but himself, and with, himself he was not on the best.-of terms. Thep there ,  was Mrs. Blair-well married, happy in her choice, but full of anxious solicitude for her father, which she dared not reveal; and, besides, he had so many peculiarities which the affectionate benevolence of her nature was con- tinually trying to gloss over, that, with all the sunbeams, there were shadows, and many a working ninmat e in her -service had a lighter heart tha-n herself.  Living near the depot! was it so very desirable?            '  ,   THE REIGNING KING.        181 Whly, yes. Many people found it so; for the fame of Uncle Sam's ewealth, and the palace in whch he lived, and - the hospitality for whichh he was distinguished brought to his door every remote branch of his family; and  wherever there was a "Beals," the individual claimed anl affinity, and on flthat score resolved on a visit. Invalid friends, particularly, enjoyed the quiet of such a home; and even the dyspeptic fourth cousin, now over three- score and ten, thought he would advise with his quack doctor, who would be in the city certain days in the week, and lie could stay with his cousin Sam, in his country, home, while thus advised. So he hobbled down to the city, and took the ears to "Beals's. Crossing," where, for allny lengtht of time, he was vWilling to abjure his sawdust puddings8, and try the' efficacy of a rare bit of suboin; alnd sometimes, to give a " little tone to his stomach," he would try what did not prove him to be a pledged Ian q hypochondriacs, too, who were advised 'by their medi- cal friends " to try a chance of air and diet," remembered that they were schoolmates with Uncle Sam; and as he kept "tonics" for. the stomach, they imagined some for the mind might thus be attained' gratis. Uncle Sam's private room was thus filled with guests who were to- bacco chewers, cigar smokers, anti-cold-water men, and old cronies with whom an intimacy would not be -consid-, ered: very desirable. Yet the old man seemed content with any society who would favor his side of the temper- 16   182     UNCLE, SAM'S PALACE; OR, ance question; and little as we account the influence thus exerted; yet it helped swell -the amount of those who de- flied all attempts at reformation; and- sundry hits and flings at. the, cause, thus retailed among .young people, helped them to support their law-hating .position; for these old visitors always narrated what "Mr. Beals said " with more confidence in its being sound, than they did their Bible texts as being true. So, even here, Uncle Sam's influence was baneful. In a short time, however, he began to grow uneasy. Talking with his old German gardener; examining plants and rare exotics with his Hibernian florist; looking at the coachman, 'as he brushed the fine span of horses, with much more satisfaction and pride than he felt ais the owner of 'them'; and then indulging in a social' walk - around the grounds with some visitor,not always of an agreeable turn' of conversation, Uncle Sam's old restless- ness returned, and he sighed for his station in the dingy. counting room on the wharf, for a look at his daybook and leger, and an order for " puncheons," " butts,"' and " quar- ter casks," accompanied with a personal intrview,. where-. in was set forth the defiance which the law encountered in some misguided regions, and the probability that the traffic would'be continued uninterruptedly, since sol many leading characters were in favor of "amendments and modifications " who voted for the law as it now stood. - To this sort of conversation Uncle Sam never seemed   THE REIGNING KING.       183 tired of listening. It strengthened him on certain points, where, by reflection, he was prone to find a weakness coming over him; and so, on the whole; he wondered what the dream of his youth meant which depicted his happiest days those of retired leisure, with sufficient to minister to every gratification. He had attained them now--all, every thing but the happy part of his lot. When he had amassed fifty thousand dollars, he remem- bered -to have promised his wife, when he doubledt that sum, he would retire to some pleasant nook in the coun- try, and pass in I etirement the remainder of their days, eating the satisfactory fruits of their Wealth. But alas! when that period arrived, his wife was dead! And .then he promised again, when his son Thomas should arrive at maturity, that he would surrender to him his business; but when that day came, the son was in Calcutta, and since then he had shipped to California; and now, he greatly feared, he was dead, as a journal chronicled that a party of miners, who set off for the dry diggings, were robbed and most shockingly murdered; and the name of "Beals" was among the catalogue. This was more than two years ago, and yet no information to confirm or con- tradict such a report arrived.  The subject was one of such painful interest, that Un- cle Sam never alluded to it.' Indeed, it was his habit, if any tiling greatly weighed upon his spirits, to avoid all , conversation upon it; because it was a settled conviction   184     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; On, With him, that what we cease to talk about we think less of; and this theory he carried into every thing but his business,: When he was vexed here, he always gave vept to his troubled soul. And now he had reached the other climax of his past expectations, which was, if his daugh- ter could but be happily settled and judiciously married, he would give his thoughts more entirely to subjects fitted to the verge of old age, and let party legislation, and their triumphs and defeats, find in him an uninterested observer. He was now just in this stage of existence, and how far had he redeemed those promises? He had omitted the cultivation of those interior resources which would have kept him calm and tranquil.' He seemed to be unwilling to belfeve that he was a traveller almost at the end of his journey, and that it became him to rejoice over those reformatory movements which he now so virulently op- posed. Was he too old to retire? or were his thoughts too undisciplined, and his feelings too unsubdued, to allows -him peace in his once-coveted leisure? And we may ask here if Uncle Sam is the only indi- vidual who has found that prospective dreams and actual realities do not coincide? Is it not a rare sight to find one who has actively engaged in the enterprises of the day, been absorbed in its commerce, and counted his gains from year to year-- I ask, does not the tyrannical habit of our minds become so much a part of our being, that we cannot turnm aside and find the peaceful, tranquil   THE REIGNING KrING.      .185 enjoyment we had hoped to realize? It would be well if in our activity there -were more preparation-. toenter upon ... other pursuits--if the absorbing love of accumulation could have fixed boundaries, and: thus give a freer play to our benevolent aspirations. Uncle Sam felt the need of something which riches did not procure for, him. It is doubtful whether the subject which harassed him the most, namely, the passage of the liguor law, if it were entirely annulled, would have made him perfectly at ease. Who can say but some harrowing misgivings of his wicked influence in thus fighting against the glreat promoter of that true basis- upon which good order and sobriety are conspicuous would not have inter- nally disquieted him? It may be he could not have reconciled his conduct to himself any more than we that observe his course can -do. Yet thus fretted and chafed with anil opposition to the right, and a determination to do all he could to contravene its advancement, he never re ted without participating in every thing, whice constdy kept him in a state of fer- mentation. Just at this time, the parish over which Mr. Grazewell ministered began to be seriously agitated. It commenced in the fact of his refusal to join with certain leading mem- bers of his church, who had invited a distinguished lec- turer to set forth to them the difficulties which really stood- in the face of the law, and to consider the objections 16'      '              ;    '186     v UNCLE SAI'S PALACE; OR, which the opponents of the law urge as a reason for its nullification. Mr. Grazewell refused to lend his personal countenance, and even advised that, the vestry of his church should not be desecrated by such " itinerant catch- penny lecturers."' Evidelntly he was not a man of sound judgment, or he would not have thus spoken; at least, he was bound to maintain a neutral position until he had heard the argument, and then the independent action which he maintained himself he ought to have been willing to have conceded to others.  But Uncle Sam, it was currently reported, put the sanction of his, influence upon the reverend gentleman's course. And have we not seen whence came much of the indifference, if not the hostility, with which some men's lips are sealed? Think you clear heads and sound - hearts, who can trace out all the intricate windings'of theological warfare, and predict the effect of this and that system of religion upon the community,--that can ex- plore the scientific advantages of modern inventions, and follow out ,their glorious results in coming time, -are so blinided that they cannot, see that whatever removes the great stain upon our moral character should be zealously pushed forward, if the film of self-interest, the cataract of popular favor, did not effectually render the light im- pevious? All honor, tlen, to an open avowal of manly conviction, whenever and wherever found.   i An energetic man in Parson Grazewell's church was ' :               '  * ,  ' .  "  *'   THE REIGNING KING.        187 one day heard& to remark, for his part, he never could find out what Uncle Sam did believe. Whereupon, Flash, who was formerly a clerk in Uncle Sam's liquor store, and Who was something of a wag, thus wrote down his "creed," gathered from maxims frequently enforced upon the attention of clerks in S. Beals's employ.- It ran thus:-   '  ,  '  "I believe in the unspeakable advantage which money confers; in the undeniable truth, that, by taking care of the cents, the, dollars will take care of themselves. - I be- lieve that choice spirits may be adulterated, and get sold as the genuine article,.free from any foreign admixture. I also believe in labelling sundry casks so as to deceive the purchaser. I believe all temperance movements are -obstructed by branding them as fanatical. I believe 'it is unwise to legislate upon the subject; that all prohibitory laws which curtail the traffic, and put in jeopardy one's pecuniary interests, deserve the indignation of; the public; but that when we are made to suffer by such lawmakers, we are bound to secure such an extended license system as shall render said law perfectly inoperative. - "I believe in a stomach, rather than a conscience; that the flutterings of the former are often mistaken for the' rapping of the latter. I also believe that intemperance is, an evil, but that it cannot be eradicated unless we import a race with new appetites, and whose pecuniary interests are not involved-.   ',T   . - UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; O,          I 'I also believe in the enjoyment of the good things of this life; and as to the retributions of another state, I am not so clear about the mnatter. A little leaven- is quite likely to leaven the whole lump. The members of Parson Grazewell's church who would think independently, wisely concluded they would be trammelled no longer; and so they seceded from  the society. This might have induced others to have followed \ in their footsteps, for fear of the heavy taxation which "ght fall upon the few; but was not Unele Sam's wealth the 'foundation stone upon which a firm structure could be maintained? and had not Mr. Grazewell aicted inl refer- ence to this knowledge? Yet not wisely, as we prophe- sy; for hushed, and. blinded, and fed by self-interest, or led; by party spirit, know ye not that a day is coming wheni such specious reasoning, such reluctant setters-forth e of great. truths, will hide their diminished heads; whien the broad, diffusive light of the- sun of temperance shall have pierced every cranny of our hearts; and the secret defiers of law shall then gladly touch 0o nmuch as the hem! of the garments of the bold pioneers who noWv, tilough often obstructed, are forced to remove th-e barriers which public opinion sanctions as suitable drawhacks to an on- ward course? The wailing? cry of an orphaned heart;- the bitterer anguish of a crushed and pleading wife, that her home may1 once more be guarded by its rightful head; yea, more, the imperative plea which the inthralled victim   THE REIGNING KING.        Iu" makes for himsef,- that society may not place such tempta- tion within his reach, will be heard; and Uncle Sam, and popular opinion, and reckless opposition, and Parson Grazewell, with his self-interested party, shall all be as things which were, and are not; and no bitter irony sug- gests such a conclusion; for we trust nothing but the pure,' love of humanity, prompts us to- work on, assured we shall conqter, thou2gh we die in the struggle." The 'next Sabbath, therefore,' witnessed many. vacant pews in the church where Mr. Grazewell ministered; but fr. Tims came il, and was about negotiating for two pews, and the clerk we before mentioned was presented -with one by Uncle Sam; {nd one and another often re- counted the kindness of the old man who had so recently come amiong them.

But Provi- dence works not as man works, to bring about positive results.   THE REIGNING KING.       ll CHAPTER XV. The Return of the lost Son. - His History. - A Warning to Young MAlen. UNCLE SAM sometimes took'"Vulcan," his large family horse, and rode into the city alone in an easy, square- topped chaise, made to order, which carried his body very gently, let the state of his mind be as it would. The day we are now recalling before us was one which he had set apart to hold a consultation with Squire Sims about some old accounts, which required adjustment. He had been detained later than usual; and it was in the early twi- light, as he was jogging along, musing upon the amount which -he had paid as bondsman for the offenders who had been convicted of a violation of the law, (and, alto- gether, he was not in so comfortable a state as. he could' desire,) when a young man stepped out from the roadside, and, in a somewhat harsh tone of voice, inquired, "Can: you tell me how far it is to Beals's Crossing?" Uncle Sam replied somewhat evasively, like a genuine Yankee, and inquired of him whom he wished to see at that station. The young man replied, 4Old Mr. Beals, who, they say, has built a splendid palace out j"there; and if so, X want to see it."   192  :   UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR,  "Well, well, young man," continued the old gentleman, -it will be rather late for you to satisfy your curiosity to- night. Hadn't you better defer your visit till to-morrow? I suppose you belong to some ofr my old friends." , a May be you are Mr. Beals yourself, sir," inquired the youpg man. "Yes, that's my name. I'm Samuel Beals," replied the old gentleman, a little pettishy. "Did you ever have a son Thomas," pursued 1the trav- eller, ' who went to California, and - and " "And what?" breathlessly asked Uncle Sam. ^ He died, didn't he? Tell me; are you one of the party who escaped the robbers?   . "Yes, sir," said the young man, putting his foot into -the stirrup of the chaise. "I'm Tommy Beals, your son." "Thomas! No, no, you arenot Thomas. He was. e as a slender boy. You must not quiz an old mgn, my lad& Tell me, what do you know of my son? I believe he ,died, years ago, in California. He was a tall, straight young man. I've had some misgivings about the manner of his death, as reported; but they tell me it's no uncom- mon thing, in that region, to rob and murder. Miany a sleepless night have I had on the poor boy's account; and now, if you know any thing of the history of Thomas Beals, I'm in a hurry to hear it." "Father," replied the young man, "I am he." Uncle Sam let go the reins. He was in a cold perspi-   THE REIGNING KING.       193. ration. That voice did sound natural. He began to know his boy; and when again, think you, he adverted to the thoughlts which a moment ago occupied him? After he had recovered himself a little, and had gazed, land gazed again, to detect the lineaments of his son by the dim twilight, and had put his hand upon his cheek, and rubbed down his linsey-woolsey overcoat, as if there were an instinct in the touch which nature gives us to recognize our own, he bade him put his -dingy carpet bag into the front of his chaise, and seat himself beside him, and, even then, his emotions overpowered him; and had it not been for a powerful blowing, and a kinda of "hacking cough," one might have supposed there were tearsi But the flowing current, if there were one, was absorbed by the free use of a large, red bandanna, which ' seemed to prove just what the old man desired--a per- feet coancealer; for it was feminine to weep. Uncle Sam seldom allowed himself to do so. Vulcan, who had all this time been standing, now started without waiting for his master's " chirrup ;" and the father and son rode on at an animated pace, the father often putting to Thomas the question, "What will your sister thinly? And, Thomas," pursued he, "h ow 'did you come here?" as if now his senses hardly credited what he saw. "When did you arrive? and are you poor, my son? What has altered you so? for it seems to me I should never have known you. How fleshy you look!"   194.     UNCLE SAN'S PLAXCE; OR, It took but little time fo/ Thomas to reply that he ,are rived from New York yesterday evening; that he went at once to the old -house, where -he found another occu- pant; and then he hurried to the nearest hotel, and found that his father having become immensely rich, had retired from business, ,and had built a palace in the suburbs; and that his sister was married. Almost penniless as he was, it gave a new impulse to his lost- ambition - and so, repre- senting his case to the landlord, he found no difficulty in borrowing a sum sufficient for a decent outfit at the tai- lor's; for the landlord well knew Uncle Sam, and was not fearful of the consequences.  Thomas, from his host, gathered all the information which 'was current about the extent of his father's' wealth, and, before retiring, washed down the whole with a heavy glass of whiskey, besides replenishing his flask, which he took with, him to his chamber. Of course, he rose late the next morning; andd having engaged to meet a few of his old, returned ,travellers that day, he was punctual to his engagement; and not until towards evelin- ing was he in a fit condition to appear as the lost son :at his father's house; and then he had missed the cars, and so was plodding his way on foot when overtaken by his father.  Was it any wonder that UncledSam was so incredulous - and reluctant to recognize the traveller? for many times during that short ride he would add, "You may not be   t THE REIGNING KING.      195 my Tommy, afterA a11 but your voice is a little like your mother's. I can tell, however, when I get you landed;" and" then he gave the horse a violent jerk with his reins, which caused him to rattle off at a tremendous speed. Thomas told but the outlines of his history before they arrived at the gate of their home. Vulcan trotted straight into the spacious barn, and there neighed for the groom to release him from his tackling, while Uncle Sam and Thomas threaded their way through a short, winding walk, to a spacious piazza; and opening, a central door, they were led through the hall into the dining room. Mr. and Mrs. Blab' were there, awaiting their father's return. An elegant, and somewhat showy, exterior, to Thomas, made him glance at the ceiling, and then to the couple seated at the farther end of the spacious room. "Well," said Uncle Sam; in rather an agitated tone, "I have brought a stranger to see you, daughter. I want you to inspect him, and tell me who he is. Come, child, turn up the solar lamp a little higher, and let's have light enoughl."  Mrs. Blair stepped forward, and in a moment rushed into her brother's arms. "Brother Thomas," said she, "are you alive, and here?" She then sallied back, and was only: prevented from 'falling by being seized by her husband, who was completely overwhelmed by the spec- tacle before him.  It is needless to add, that the supper that night was    196   -  UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; ORn, deferred 'till a late hour, an that little appetite was felt for l  zany of the viands. Such an astonishment always makes us insensible to the claims of hunger, and sleep, too; for , what can, quiet such a tumultuous rush of feelings as those reawakened by lost affection? No, there was little sleep for the father and daughter that night; yet the returned son lay tpon his downy bed, and quickly yielded himself to a sound slumber, as if he had not been stirred by any extra emotion. We, sometimes meet the phrase, hard- ened sensibility." We think we see it manifested here. Thomas was not a guest at the breakfast table the next morning. Indeed, he did not rise untilthe gentle tap of his sister upon the door 'made him answer it in a some- what coarse tone,-"Hallo! who's there?" apparently, at the moment, forgetting himself and the new situation 'in which --he was placed-; yet how could he- remain insensible to the assiduous care of his affectionate sister, who attend- ed so scrupulously to his outward appearance, furnishing him with the nicest linen from her husband's wardrobe, and brushing off the dust sand dirt which adhered to his new suit, which was worn yesterday for the first time? And how it delighted her to find a ready. compliance, after all, with her wishes! for, at her suggestion, he relieved himself of that unsightly patch of hair about his mouth, and of those heavy whiskers, which, to his sister's eyes, gave him such an unnatural appearance; for she would -*  ,     .            (   M -. .   .. THE REIGNING KING.             197 fain make him a boy again, hoping thereby to exert an. influence that might yet be salutary. When Mrs. Blair had thus fitted her brother to appear in the morning in her father's presence, she found there were marks of'a wasted life which she could not efface. There was that impress upon the countenance which no art or contrivance could conceal. His eyes were red and heavy, or glassy by turns; and his face was blotched, and needed sundry patches to conceal a pimple or a blotch; so that, after having done her best, she could not effect what an inward purification might have done; yet she put her slender hand within his coarse, hardened one, and they walked together- into their father's room, where he sat thoughtfully looking at some stray papers. And what a sight was' here!, Purity and imperfection, innocence and transgression, a guileless daughter and an improvi- dent, dissipated son. Could Uncle Sam, at this very moment, have said one word in defence of the liquor trade?  :In the course of the day, Thomas was introduced to the ervants about the establishment; and the duties of each ,were made krown to him. He did not, however, mani- fest much personal interest in the lovely landscape which his sister pointed out, to him; nor much enthusiasm in Surveying the many attractions which were concentrated about the, lovely spot whereon the palace stood. His taste seemed depraved, his appetite perverted; and, 17*    198    - NCLE SAM'S PALACE; ORj before twilight, John, the coachman, carried him from the house of the German farmer in a sleep which intoxication had produced.- Uncle Sam and his daughter sat together, that even- ing, alone. They talked over what course had better be taken with the son and brother; and again -were the father's fainting hopes revived by the encouraging tones of her who had so often warded off many dark aspects of life by her genial sunshine of cheerful trust, "that there was something better in store; ;? and then ,she- nar- rated how many who had, fallen as low, and become as degraded, as her brother, had been restored, and become useful members of society.          i. -When it was thus made a personal matter, how willing- ly Uncle Sam drank in the comforting influences which temperance confers upon a redeemed man! But alas! how incoisistent was his course! The effort to redeem the son would cost him about as painful a struggle as it would that son to redeem himself. Did he sometimes wish or feel he could be entirely reconciled to his death or absence, or, at least, some change by which he could be removed from his presence? We cannot always put out of sight that which offends us, without paying a penalty for doing so.      We will here subjoin a little history of the course Uni- cle Sam early pursued with his only-son, trusting that, should any unreflecting parent glance over the pages who   THEE REIGNING KING.       199 is making any approximation to a similar one, it may arrest his attention, and cause him to pause before he proceeds. Thonmlas Beals, in early life, was an ungoverned child. As we have said previously, he early lost his mother - that judicious, and almost indispensable, guardian, we were about to add, of his future character. The father pleaded a want oftinze to manage him properly--a plea which can never be safely urged by any discreet parent, since what appropriation of time can be better, made than 'moulding, guiding, and restraining a child of such a pe- culiar temperament as was his boy? But no; he must sell his liquors; and there was an enormous business accumulating when Thomas was a boy; and he was troublesome at home;; and so he thought,' by placing him at a first-class boarding school, he should accomplish all he could desire. Let us hear the directions he gave to the principal of the school the velry day he left him in'his charge. He first fumbled over his pocket book, and took out a twenty-dollar bill, alid handing it to the .teacher, added, "This, sir, is for my boy's spending money. He cannot live without some little perquisites. Sometimes he wants' a few cents for powder, sometimes for confectionery; and I wish you to apportion this money at yourown discre- tion."                     - The teacher replied, I know no such wants among   200     LNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, 'myboys. We teach them the principles ofi rigid self- denial in these matters, Mr. Beals." "Well, well,' replied Mr. Beals, "I don't want hiim put in too straight a jacket. I can afford himn such indul- gences as I have named; and, it is my belief, that if you restrain a'boy when it is in your power-to indulge himn, by and by, when he comes in possession of means to in- dulge himself, he will run, riot, and resolve to take double pay for past prohibitions." But hot so thought the teacher. He contended for self, control at an early age; so Mr.1 Beals only added, "I don't- care how strict a watch you keep over my son. Make him mind; make him study; in one word, make something of him, sir, that I can look upon ,as a man. That's what I want; and if you succeed in doing this, any pecuniary compensation I can give you will be most readily bestowed. The boy is smart; but he wants cor- recting; and, as I said, I hope you will fix himso that he will never dishonor the name of Beals." The teacher promised to do his best; and the father of -the boy went away satisfied that he] had done alt he could for his child. Thomas, however, did not fit in very well to the 'niche which was assigned him ini this school. The instructor ;  soon found he had a hard subject to manage. There was a wild, Uncouth manner about him --a native vein of -independence which produced a great turbulence of spirit           ' ,   THE REIGNING KING;        201  when corrected; and he did not-prefer to assimilate with the gentle and, amiable lads around'hiim. He was always up So some species of fun -full of roguery; yet, on the whlle, as there was no real malignity of disposition man- ifes-ed, the teacher hoped to set him on the right track. Bubt he was an exceedingly troublesome lad to manage. He was not a dull scholar; for he readily committed his lesson, and, when his task was completed, seemed to be planning some feats by which to entangle others, so that the influence he thus exerted was soon perceptible; and before half his first quarter had expired, Mr. Beals re- ceived a note from the principal, saying he must request the removal of his son, " as his course was so very annoy- ing, and prolific of influences which he was obliged to condemn." Mr. Beals, however, passed them all over to the score of boyish propensities; and smoothing over the whole with the phrase, "I used to do just so myself when a boy," and with a' slight self-conceit, we may suppose an unekpressed thought ran- through his mind--, If my son makes as likely a man as I have, I shall be satisfied." He therefore persuaded the teacher to let Thomas remain to the end of .the term, when he came back with no very flattering letter of recommendation, although his teacher gave him full credit for many magnanimous traits of character. e From this school he was sent to his uncle Richard's; i ,   202     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE;  OR, and to this day does his auint remember the ships she used to find floating in her-- pans of milk, and the perforated pies which had lost the nice preparation between the crusts, besides the empty egg-shells, and the hams from :whichh the lean and savory parts weree extracted'; and  then ,his uncle often found his tools displaced, and- his locks out of order- in fact, every thing which- indicated that kind -of mischief which goes very far towards making i good-natured people peevish so that, in les's than a month, Thomas wasaagtain returned as " the city boy wlho learned country lads bad tricks." And the houselkeeper at home always met his fa- ther with a sad tale: either the boy had locked up his .I siste or committed some depredation which marred the   i peace of an otherwise well-regulated family.; so- that Uncle Sam had :been' heard time and again to say, "he had rather bring up a dozen girls than one -boy," ever. ^  seeming to suppose that all boys were alike. It were well  if parents did not impute too much to the volatile spirit - of boys, thereby 'affording a-- kind of justification to con- duct which ought to be severely reprimanded.      !  When Thomas returned from the country, his father resolved to put him in a store. He had a friend in the  I hardware trade, who had advertised "for a boy whose   I parents resided in the city." Mr. Beals applied for' the I situation, and obtained it for his son; For a short time, - Thomas went along swimmingly. He was strong, worked   5 -.-   THE REIGNING KING.       203 " well, and appeared to satisfy his employer.; and his fa- ther's heart beat for joy, supposing his a" wild oats " were all fairly sown. In course of time, however; Thomas in- formed his father that he should be detained, for a season, late at night; and. to avoid disturbing his slumbers, and to prevent his awaiting his return till past midnight, he de- sired the use of a night key, which would obviate all trou- ble. The unsuspecting father, never questioning the mo-  tives of his child, immediately procured one; and this was the seal of his reckless course. He had now connected himself with an association of young men, whose ostensible object was to meet and prac- tise on a popular system of bookkeeping, but whose real one was thus to meet; and as each member contributed a certain sum, it was- expended to procure some convivial enjoyment. The animal spirits thus elicited craved more stimulus, and wine was introduced, as an enlivener of mirth.: In a short time, however, the party became bois- terous; the police interfered; the rowdy young gents were- secured, their place of rendezvous broken up, and their fathers informed of their excesses. The whole com- pany were thus scattered; and the usual resort which a disappointed parent and a reprobate child find falls to their lot is frequently to ship for some foreign port in a merchant vessel which is commanded by a strict and faithful captain, where the only requirement demanded is "common wages, plenty ofwork, and good usage.;"   204     UNCLE SA:M'S PALACE; On, otherwise the incorrigible young men are sent to some farm" house in the country, or apprenticed away from home;: I The task of rearing and disciplining such hard subjects is thus committed to foreign hands - a common but un- suitable course. 'Would it not be more judicious to hire some one for the' task of overseers of other business, rather than quench the sacred- influences which should- be maintained beside our own liearthstones? Admitting there must be .severity, and a restraint which is painfully oppressive,'who should improve it with such power as a parent? I know there are: shrinking hearts and incom- petent hands; but if you are a parent, you must remake and remodel yourself, and not shrink from responsibilities which God and nature impose upon the trust thus com-  mitted to you. Besides, is it-not the dictate of common sense, that the most solicitous in one's well being should guard the character? I know there'are refractory spirits and wayward tempers -who rush in- hot haste from pa- rental control; but gc back to their childhood: was your training judicious when'the bud first opened? - There is a fearful amount of responsibility on this head somewhere. And Thomas Beals was next sent on an East India- voyage, for a year's absence. Had we time here, w' could narrate that sister's motherly care; how nicely she prepared her brother's outfit; how thoughtful she-,wwas, lest, in days of weariness, he should not be fed with:        . d   THE REIGNING KING.        205 profitable employment for his mind. So a book was in- terspersed between the folds of every garment, with a note here and there, indicative of love; and at the bottom of tie trunk lay many keepsakes, which fond memory always cherishes -a watchguard from the glossy hair of liis departed mother; her miniature; likewise that of herself and father, and the Bible. O, did not the reck- less young man sometimes pause in his career, and weep in the presence of the crew? for sailors have not all hardened hearts, that correspond with their occupations. And then the long months which elapsed before a sin- gle word came informing that father or daughter of the ship's arrival, and the good health of the crew How they sat together, often busied with' the' same thoughts, yet making no mention to each other of the subject! for we again see the father always desired to banish from his lips what was unpleasant to hs thoughts. And when this same young man returned, he did not look as they hoped he would. There was a. swaggering air, a coarse de- meanor, a profane jest, and sometimes a vulgar utterance, which stung that sensitive sister to the quick. His asso- ciates,'too, were of the same character as himself., He would often absent himself for the space of -twenty-four hours, and thus give a continual anxiety to those two hearts, to whom he was bound by the tenderest love. It would be revolting to our taste, and give no favora;bIe impression to others; to narrate the young man's impru- 18 ,         s   206     UNCLE SAM'S PALAE; OR,  denuces and recklessness. We are obliged too often to look upon such spectacles; and a minute description of. the petty deceits and evil practices which one habituated to foolish sins commits -needs no record to those who are obliged to look upon them; and if there are those who have escaped such knowledge, we would not disturb a happy ignorance of the depravity to wlhich such excesses lead. Suffice it to say, when Thomas Beals shipped for Cali- fornia many hearts rejoiced that so baneful an influence was removed from the society of their children; and the bitterness of parting was somewhat mollified even to the father -and daughter by a vague hope that somehzw and somewhere a change would yet give to them a son and a brother. The father, therefore, negotiated with the cap- tain in whose service Thomas was placed that his son should have all reasonable indulgences, be kindly treated, Sand a place secured to him on his arrival- a promise which was faithfully imade, but not kept, by the com- mander; -yet the young man really proved himself so agreeable to the passengers, that no little interest was felt - in is welfare. In a strange land, therefore, he soon joined a party of explorers; and being- of a constitution which could endure much hardship, he shrank from no exposure; but, some- times working in deep water, and sometimes in mines, he still continued robust and healthy. "When there-was no   .   THE REIGNING KING.       207 liquor to be had," writes one of his company, "Beals was a treasure; but when he went into cities, he fell a prey to its destructive influence." For months afterwards, being in a locality from which liquor was excluded, Thomas worked well and success- fully, and amassed that which, divided, yielded each of the party the sum of three thousand dollars. The reck- less young man then separated from his company, and joined a race of strangers, who, in a fit of intoxication, robbed him of his treasure, and wrote to his friends that he was undoubtedly lost, and then despatched a list of names, (all spurious,) including Beals, -who shared the same fate. We hear no more of him, therefore, until he met his' father on the eventful evening we have nar- rated.  This epitome of the history of the son of a rich man it has been painful to describe. We would so much l rather live and linger amidst the sunny influences of a virtuous course and a correct life, that we have excluded much which would have given no more favorable. aspect to the young man's character. We would- only hope that such a history as we have portrayed may teach Vy young man who is prone to deviate from the path of rec- titude that he enters upon a thorny road; and it behooves him to stop and consider, before he advances another step, whether the gain of a broken reputation and a shat-   208     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE'; On,  tered head and heart is worth coveting--whether the loss of the esteem of the good and the friendship of the wise is recompensed by nightly excesses, and by the re- morse which follows when-one feels himself an outcast and a stranger from those in the sunshine of whose af- fectiorns he was once prized as their dearest /earthly treasure. ,                     ,  !, '"'   T  EEIGNIN   KING.      209 * CHAPTER XVI.

TilERE seemed but one dark shadow which rested upon Uncle Sam's Palace, so far as the outward observer could looki. W elin the old man was 'fretful, why, it was all' passed over to the account of having so worthless a son,; and to solve the question why Mrs. Blair lost a part ok her usual vivacity, the same reason was assigned. Yet sometimes a hope would rekindle in the lacerated hearts of the father and' daughter, that the object over which they mourned with such intense solicitude would yet re- deem his character, and become a man. "If he Could buct be placed without tne reachl of temptation,' remarked Mr. Blair, "it might prove his salvation." But so long as he saw such convivial parties at the palace - so long as the father continued to keep the quarter cask in the cellar on tap, and to bring, for the entertainment of his guests, those Oldy labelled bottles, which,often gave a boisterous character to their mirth, so long would the son gcontend- 18                -   210     UNCL-E SA I'S PALACE; On, that if he but followed what he saw the father-do, whlerein had he the greater guilt?  r ,Ar. Blair had so uiged thif argument upoin Mr. reals, lthat he removed to a lockup all the exposed wine which stood in his cellar; but had not Thomas frequent calls to. the city? and did he not there meet withll companions 1 who : would decoy him into the " licensed saloons," where the appetite could be satiated to repletion? and-then, with swollen eyes, was he not cast out to make his way home, toosend a fresh thrill of anguish into their crushed hearts? What could Uncle Sam urge in defence of ' licens- / ing " such places of resort? Was it not made sufficiently obvious to him that he was only reaping what he had sowed? To how much of this plague spot had he admin- istered? Those old books in the counting room on the wharf had no tongues to tell for how much of his wealtl he was indebted to such purchasers, who tenanted these places of fashionable resort. And how he had advocated their iights! How strenuously had he fought for them! Was it but a righteous retribution that he should be forced to feel the practical workings of a system he had thus advocated? Depend on it, Uncle Sam' -had thoughts which -never pressed upon him with such force before. All night long he would toss upon his bed of allguish, not daring to divulge his feelings, not courageous enough to openly acknowledge the 'error of his ways,; and so the stings of an aroused conscience -would weaken his   THE REIGNING SING.       2f 1 physical nature, and in narcotics and drugs, he would vainly hope to find relief. A disquieted conscience makes a demand which can- not always be put to sleep. Unlike the paroxysms of fever, which may be affected by outward appliances, or the inroads of any contagious disease, for- which some specific may be successfully applied, - unlike any of the i thousand forms in which poor humanity is eatalogued, for which every quack nostrum  is advertised as completing a perfect cure, or no pay,"-this little disquieting tor- menter will assert its prerogative; and if you seek to drown it by a heavy potation, or silence it in the zest-of soe luxurious viands  or animated conversation, when you have exhausted these expedients, it will come ta2pinp at soe midnight hour   ,  at so;e nzidn/t bor; antl, however unwelcome may be its intrusion, it will come in; and the best way to make it an a   lreeable  guest is to give it a cordial reception.

It is of Pno use to attempt any further resistance, Mr. Beals. You are in- dicted, and must answer to the moral prosecution. How could he have spoken out from his oppressed heart? But there was a feeling le lest he should betray a cause he had so long advocated. There were his best friends, whose opinions he so highly- valued. There would be a tremendous sensation produced if the stronghllold upon which others had so long leaned were weakened'; and the only alternative was: to still " brood over the sin he had the power to heal," or, at, least, arrest, in high places. Was he a man, thus to shrink from the dictatesqof duty, parental love, and moral obligations, which haunted hint wherever he turned? Let us leave him a while -to strug- gle with his conflicts, premising, however, that the absorb- ing topic of his conversation," that the law shall be -re- pealed or modifed," is not so strenuously maintained as formerly.

Having administered upon the es- tate of Mr. Richard Beats, Mr. Sims made it ieceslsary to do personally what is usually done by proxy; and the conduct of Rosa had not, of late, been satisfactory. She vexed him continually, affirming "an old man's heart was not worth preserving; that he was fitted for some widow who!had parental trials; " and although there seemed no particular object upon, which poor Sims could wreak his jealousy, yet there was an unrequited sentiment which was not aroused in her young heart. Even her mother, much as she respected the character of the bachelor, had her misgivings whether she ought to urge her daughter to accept of such a position; so that the lover was certainly in no enviable condition. He wondered why he did thus brood over so heartless a girl's affection, or, rather, the  want of it. Sometimes he felt himself a fool; but the feeling would not abide with him.  Uncle Sam was now very much depressed by the course lhis son was pursuing." He was not, every day under the immediate influence of liquor; and when 'par- tially restored, there were so many manly, generous traits of character developed in him, that the father most ear- '   - 214     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; 0R, nestly yearned for his redemption from -the thraldom in  which he was held. This subject so preyed upon his thoughts, that Mrs. Blair feared the result upon her fa- ther's health. She therefore proposed a clange of scene, where the novelty might, for a time, wear off the painful circumstances which were always threatening his peace of mind. She also proposed that Thomas should be left, so that John, thie long-tried and faithful coachman, should oversee him, should he plunge into any excesses during their absence; and, the following week, she wrote, by her father's dictation, a note to John Sims, at his Vermont residence. BEALS'S CROSSING. i DEAR SInIS: I have been a good deal harassed in mindl lately; and my daulghter proposes I should change the scene for a short time. We are desirous that you and Rosa, with her mother, should accompany us to S aratoga, where we shall be joined by Tims and his lady. I sliall cheerfully defray ,all expenses'; so you may loBd your- selves in readiness to receive Uis by- the mIid!lle o f the month. We shall stop but a short time with you, as our rooms are engaged at the "United. States Hotel," Sara- toga, from'the 19th. Yours truly, S. BEALS. Upon the reception of this letter, the first thought of   THE REIGNING KING.        215 the mother and daulghter, of course, now turned to the subject of dress; but the first thought of the bachelor was, " could he thus expose Rosa to the view of so many fashionable young men, without losing his entire hold upon her affections?" and lost people will concur with him in thinking it was a very sensible question. But, of course, the invitation was gladly accepted; and Mrs. Richard Beals was now fitted in a suit of " second mourning," from which orange flowers'in her dress caps need not be excluded. She therefore equipped herself in a variety of apparel suited to the stage of her widow- hood, and certainly succeeded in her efforts to be pos- sessed of becoming materials'with which she should ap- pear in that great promenade of fashion and exposure. Rosa was fully prepared, having always been dressed a la mode, as she iwas so often a visitor ,at the palace. So the party promised well for the ladies; but poor Sims, we must repeat, had terrible forebodings; for he was no stranger: to the free-and-easy access with which young gentlemen there approach the ladies. Yet we must dis- miss hiss doubts, and pass over all the intervening per- plexities and pleasures which attend so large a party, and introduce our friends at once into the gayeties of the sea- son, which are so conspicuously obvious upon one's first entrance to the head quarters of fashion, wine, and highl life at the "United States." Uncle Sam, who had been gloomy for some time, felt V i   216     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, revived at his first entrance. There were jolly old dram- : drinkers, who ,had heard of him, from all parts of the Unfion. No matter of what infirmity they were victims,-- no matter how they were situated at home,- all here was devoted to pleasure seeking. Hundreds of old men of his stamp were daily arriving. There was the freest in- tercourse in the world, and the greatest leisure for every one to do as he pleased, provided he outraged no known laws of good breeding; and if this were done, instant satisfaction was demanded. Old men were here rejeve- nated. They carried their gold, if not their wit, alout them - heavy fob chains, and golden opera glasses, with headed canes to match, superi vests, exquisite quality of broadcloth, plenty of ruffle shirt, and, above all, a swag- gering independence which cotuld dip ianew into life's fri- volities, sit at the gaming table without a blush, turn off a small sea of champagne and other ;liquors,- walk about highly excited, or sit still and blink with each other upon the colonnade, not forgetting to mark and, remark upon the belles who graced the " last hop," or flirted so admira- bly with some old, seedy beau. Here, too, the parson met his parishioner, all on the same footing. 'Perchance he came in from the "' Unon," ' "Congress Hall," just to give a higher zest to his ani- mal spirits. They had all, for. a season, left the " confer- ence rooms" and "united prayer meetings,^ and omitted or relaxed their efforts to regenerate the heathen, since   217 THE REIGNING KING. they had come to be regenerated themselves. And then all the restraints of times and seasons, as it respects ob- servances, were here omitted. There were no public pray-. ers offered at these fashionable houses. Every thing seemed to rather say, "This is pleasure ground; walk ye in it." There are two celebrated divines in yonder corner. MBark you how they slyly peep into the adjoining ball room. "There is something enlivening in the air of that music," remarks Dr. A. "And a fascination in that lively dance," replies Dr. B, "Have you seen how, lovely the belle of the evening looks?" How many subjects for sermons are thus secured! But have a care, gentlemen. Don't lose too much of your staid demeanor. The world is looking on. But why depict the enjoyment of the gentlemen in this gay scene? See you that moving, thing of life, composed of silver gauze, diamonds, and bouquets? 'Mark you the delicacy of her complexion, the glossy wave of her ringlets, the perfect symmetry of her form, the matchless elegance of her movements? To-morrow evening shall present the same lovely fair one bedecked again for voluptuous pleas- ure seekers to gaze upon; for she has a change of splen- --did apparel, varying in color and texture, but all of equal magnificence and costly materials, with which she will' 19 1        O   218     UNCLE SAM'S PALACCE; OR, appear-every night during her month's sojourn. She is, perchance, the "peerless Miss E.," engaged, it is sup- posed, to: the "exquisite Mr. F.," of such remarkable standing and unsurpassed wealth. How she is looked upon! .Is she modest? One would almost vouch 'for it; for there is a downcast expression, a faint blush, a gait: that savors little of affectation. And what if you did overhear that these are " all borrowed charms;" that, for successive summers, this butterfly has exhibited her gor- geous coverings; and that she is the same heartless para- gon of fashion who caused the duel be'tween Colonel E. and Commodore N.?- She has a new' set of adlmirers, this year, 'who care not for this. , Anid do you notice that widower, Colonel B., from the south, with whom you have a slight acquaintance?, You -were in Charleston, a few months tago, when his wife died. EHe was 'a frantic man then-could not attend to any business transactions, on account of the violence of his grief. He has been urged by his physician to try ca change of place. His minister has' told him the conse- quences of such grief are' often fatal; that he ought to be resigned ; and the man has been trying to imagine he is, because dire necessity prompts him to be so - not that his acquiescence has been derived from trustful faith and secret communion that all events are'iordered in love, and intended as salutary discipline to abate our attach- ment to the fleeting and perishable. O, no. He has not - A *  .  . " " '   ' r                    1 , *  L  s   THE REIGNING KING.        2  been so taught by adversity. His lesson, rather,-,is, that he must seel in fashionable glare and enlivening society the panacea for. earthly troubles; and so he has put off the serious, gloomy face he once wore, and is now what? asking the beautiful Miss S. "if he shall have the pleas- ure of the next dance with her." He, too, wears a white satin vest, and carries a moss rosebud in his button hole; and he bows so obsequiously, and laughs so heartily, and brandishes his perfumed handkerchief so continually, and watches every varying movement of his partner so in- tently, there is no doubt but a ("change of scene" has changed the current of his thoughts. To-morrow you shall see him in a gay cabriolet, driven by his coachman to the " lake," while the fair Desdemona is attired in her" gorgeous brocades, seated by his side; and they are chat- ting just: as he used to do with that lady whose sepulchre is away off where the orange grove and the tall pine sur- round it, and where, when he looked into the chamber of her repose, he forever bade adieu to all that remained to bless him in this life. And is woman the only inconstant being whom we meet?   -           - Yet there she sits, with all her inconstancy, that wid- ow, the length of whose veil, and the shaded aspect of whose dwelling, for months,-nay, it is nearly a year now,-so corresponded with the sombre tenor of her thoughts. She was never abroad -never in public, save at church; and then -how reverently she listened beneath ','          '  '    220     UNCLE- SAM S PALACE; OR, those sable weeds! and, from the church to the carriage,. how dignified was her deportment!  To her intimate, friends did she not again and again declare " her treasure was intombed; that never again should she look out upon a cheerful world with a light heart "? Yet'she had ex- pressed a desire, during that time, to, retain iher coalmcan'z and carriage, and that Jne span of horses; because they afforded "]her dear iuksband d" so much pleasure, and were all of this- selection.. And her splendid dwelling- why, --ijonely and desolate as it now appeared, it was hiZs home. The associations were undoubtedly dear to her. But how came she in that lighted drawing room, among those pleas- ure seekers? and who is thatjlarge, elegantly-formed gen- tleman, upon whose arm she is so languidly leaning? He is reported to be a wealthy cotton planter; and to- morroIw he will sit in her coach; and they will converse alone about the "security of property," and whether Jane shall remain north, or John shall go south; and, by and by, they will drive to the old English church, and Mr. and Mrs. Sprigg will "know no more about deso- lation, since change hasj produced such pleasing realities. Depend upon it, Congress water and its accompanimeznts have a very invigorating effect upon most people. But why should we forget that interesting maiden, who hag so rapidly improved, of late, in her health? See you that clerical gentleman, with whom she daily takes her walk to the Empire spring? There seemed to be   ATHE REIGNING KING.       221 so great a similarity in their bodily ailments, it became necessary that each should take about the same quan- tity of water, at the same time; yet the effervescence of the draught gives no quickening effect to their gait. In- deed, they every day seem to loiter as if a great fund of conversation is yet in reserve; and when one or the other's time is expired which had been previously marked out, how opportune comes that letter from the consulting physician, advising, nay, enforcing upon them, the impor- tance , (of continuing a longer period, where the beneficial effects are so obvious "  By and by, in early autumn, a stranger will appear in the quiet village where our once invalid, but now restored, friend resides; and there will be a rumor afloat, that, instead of the lungs, the heart of each is alike affected; and it is soon conclusively manifest,' that, to cure the pres- ent difficulty, they must daily drink "Empire water " from the same can; and now the minister, instead of the doe-' tor, is consulted; and the parish priest soon after an- nounces to his flock that he has secured a helpmate that will greatly extend his usefulness; and, for the first time, the parish understand how it came to' pass that their min- ister was so benefited by the trip he took to the Springs in midsummer. Uncle Sam was so impervious to all feminine charms, it was of little moment to him what fascinating images sought to attract his attention. Yet Mrs. Bumble, the 19*   222     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, widow of Captain' Bumble, who once brought a cargo of  choice spirits to Mr. Beals, had .treasured the fact to this day, (proving, at least, she had a retentive memory;) and I so she contrived) on warm afternoons, to sit on. the piazza with the old millionnaire; and who can tell which rattled the loudest, her' stiff, full-skirted silk dress, or her tongue, with its unceasing motion? How odften did she find it convenient to inquire of' Un- cle Sam if his evening papers had arrived! And having listened attentively to his general tone of conversation with gentlemen, although she came here a professedly total abstinence widow, yet her sentiments were beginning to take a qualified turn ; and she was heard to admit to Mr. Beals, a few moments since, that she always had seri- ous doubts whether the esnforcement of the liquor law wozld be an expedient measure. And did you observe how sud- denly tiis remark aroused the old man from his unexcita- ble state, and how! he hitched up his chair a little nearer to the widow, while she leaned towards him, asp if she might be made an easy cnvert to his self-sustaining views? But how did Uncle Satm, upon reflection,-know but she might prove another medium, similar to the widow W'ilby? TThe next afternoon, he changed his location; and, that day, Mrs. Bumble sought in vain to enlist the X old gentleman in a prolonged- conversation; yet Sbe . formed the most intimate companionship with Mrs.- Blair; and rumor saith that one day she inquired of the daughter    TIIE REIGNING KING. wohether she thought her father would ever change his sit- uation in life. The answer caused her to'look sorrowful; at the same time she remarked,' "I know, child, what it is to live a solitary life;" and this was accompanied with a deep sigh, as if her fat'e were inevitably sealed. Uncle Sam, about this time, complained of nosquitoes troubling him, towards evening, upon the piazza;. so he was not seen there as often as formerly, for fear of being BITTEN. He was;however, taken aback on meeting the veritable Mrs. Bumble at an early hour, the next morn-  ing, at the Congress spring. Being unusually fleshy, she had wisely concluded to adhere to the rule which Uncle Sam followed; and it so happened that she was in readi- ness to attend him when he set off; but he limped forward a little in advance of her. They, however, met at the spring; and while they were standing around it, awaiting their turn to drink, Miss Chatterwell, a genuine absti- nence woman,?remarked to Mrs. Bumble, "If the multi- tude with whom we temperance people have to contend could be made to feel the beneficial effects of cold water as those about us do the medicinal properties of this spring, we should not be obliged to labor much longer in the cause." ; Mrs. Bumble made no reply, but looked at Uncle Sam; and this refusal to indorse her last remark was treasured by Mbiss Chatterwell; and here we desire to add, that Mrs. Bumble is not to be taken as a fair representation-   224 1    UNCLE SA'IS PALACE; OR, of he -sex; for they rarely vacillate in this cause. In proof whereof we will quote'Miss Chatterwell's remark to Mrs. B., when she had been told of the great wealth of the widower, Mr. Beals :- "And," replied she, "he got it all by the importation and sale of liquors, did he?" to which Mrs. Bumble as- sented. "Then," said she, "if, by raising my flnger, I could cause his old heart to beat with the velocity of a young man's, and he should turn towards me his favorable regard, I would spurn the thought of changing ny nazme from -Chatterwell to .Beals. No, Mrs. Bumble; an old veteran liquor dealer never need expect to gain the affec- tions of a genuine total abstinence woman ainy more than he can hope to be chosen as candidate for the presidency by the temperance party. We women have got to take a position here, Mrs. Bumble; and when we pledge our- selves not to marry men in any way connected with the shameful traffic, I rather think it will sometimes be aban- doned, on other than conscientious scruples. Do you sup- pose, if I had chosen to prove recreant to my principles, ' that I need to have lived a life of single bleSsedness till this day I Major Witherspoon pretended lie did not un- derstand me, when I told him he must firs close his dis- tillery before we could proceed any farther in the topic lihe was urging upon my attention."             , "( Well, I don't know," replied Mrs. Bumble, as one is obliged to press home the matter qeite so closely."         ,   TIlE EEIGTING KING.       225 "Then your temperance principles iest upon a wrong basis, Mrs. Bumble. If active, resolute, unflinchiing Nwo- men, years ago, had gone forward in this movement as I have, I'll warrant you the liquor law would never ha Ve been a bone of contention.. The. rib bone might have closed up tiie contest," added Miss Chatterwell.' "; blush for my sex, when I think of their want of moral courage; and what spectacle is more disgiusting than to see a wo- man disguising her real sentiments, to gain the affections of a man or the use'of his ,money, both of which are founded on a liquor cask? I once owned a copy of the ;New Testament that had a page at the close of the book stating who were forbidden to marry together. I wish I could add a few more to the list, such as, 'Tlou shalt not marry .an importer of liquors, nor a distiller, nor a whole- sale vender, nor a petty retailer in the same trafic.' Such  an interdiction would be a mighty help to the anti-Iiquor law, I can assure you. You see I'm pledged to total ab- stinence every where; as much abroad as at honze; as much, and even more, when I am talking with an old im- porter as a pledTed man, Mrs. Bumble; for I hold that women may exert a tremendous influence on this subject." ' - Mrs. Bumble betrayed some restlessness at this time. tn a day of two, Uncle Sam forgot all about her; and so she returned to her former positionj to -hold it, we trust, with a firmer grasp' when temptation again assails her in such a questionable form.   226     UNcr, E S xi's PALACE; OR, Now, all this spectacle, and much more that is unre- corded, did Uncle Sam's -party quietly witness: from the first of their arrival. The: magic charm to Mrs, Richlard Beals. and Rosa completely bewildered them. The re- mainder of the party had before looked upon many such' 7::/ spectacles. Rosa had already seen some of the most " di- vine young men that ever existed." There was one witl4 "such a, lovely mustache ;" another with such a " splendid goatee;" and a third with such a set of "admirable w]his- kers," and such "a commanding imperial, 'he was per- fectly adorable." How did the old Squire wane in her admiration! Think you she would permit Minm to be her acknowledged lover? No. "'If he never smoked an- other principe; if he never tasted another, drop of wine; if he bowed at her feet, and pledged himself as her truest and most, ardent, admirer, it was of, no use. There were young men adapted to her taste - young men who could join in the dance; who sported splendidly; who had'such independent movements ; who chatted so lively, and were suchi perfect paragons of fashion. Never, never again would she be flattered by such a fool as Johln Sims;" and she went to, sleep that night with that vow upon her lips. , Her mother did not attempt to smother her indig- nation.                   ' The next morning, Mr. and Mrs. Tims joined the party, qccompanied b6 Thomas Beals, who- had, at this time, the 6xact air and mannere of "a fast young man."  He      .         .   THEE REEIGNING KING.       227 appeared at Saratoga in a milk-white artiste hat, a high dickey turned down a la #Byron, an open-worked, dan- dified shirt bosom, and a wide-checked, flashy neck tie. Over a showy embroidered vest dangled a watch chain, the pattern of which -he probably selected from a ship's cable. He carried a ratan in his hand, and a Spanish cigar in one corner of his mouth, and wore a large seal ring upon his' little finger, and was about cultivating an "imperial."  His leg encasements were adder colored, and the last style of a bobtail dress coat helped to complete his appearance. His Congress boots were tipped with  patent leather; and occasionally they were exchanged for * a pair of dust-colored 'gaiters, with shoes that showed heels of surpassing height, so that the swaggering air he' was wont to assume was modified by a fear, when he had partaken too freely of " brandy smashers," lest he should- not strike a right balance upon the sidewalk. At this place, his favorite resort was at the billiard roomanld the ice cream saloon, where he often tookl a see, ond glass, to regulate hMs stomach, and to neutralize the effect of the cold substance lhe had so lately taken into it. His arrival was so; unexpected, that his father felt a de- gree of mortification he had not anticipated. Among the - ruffle shirt gentry there mas much inquiry who the , "young blood" was; and it was remarked, within Uncle' Sam's hearing, That fellow seems determined on, a fash- 'o nable run.". -Uncle Sam took him alone, and extorted   228,     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR,  promises which he broke the very next hour; and ill luck at the gaming table, it was said, bore heavily upon his fathe's purse; yet he -tried to gloss over the aggravatioa avo of his course, and attain a cheerfulness which he foundi it  difficult to assume..                  . ; The,                  , .

There was the morning draught at the Congress spring; the- sumptuous breakfast; "the important decisions tow the intervening time should be spent previously to- dressing for dinner; the drive in tihe, rich cabriolet; the gossamer or brocade dinner dress forthe ladies, and the last change which 'the fashion plate announces for gsentlemen; the long sitting which follows; the sentimental glances which succeed; and the engagement for the afternoon, when a farther extended arrangement follows for the " evenin;g hop."

Not so, however, were our party entertained. The young were-younzg. Thomas Beals was in his heyday of manly independence, and his cousin Rosa was fiantic with her images of beauty and fashion. Mrs. Beals'was a de- lighted widow, Squire Sims ,a jealous lover, and Uncle Sam an old man trying to extract a few more dregs from the last sip of pleasure's cup, while M{r. and Mrs. Blair', and Mfr. and Mrs. Tims, Wvere lookingy on .the gilded show, not generally moved by the intense excitement. around  them.   "        . Most of the above 'party, two or three mornings after our last account, were standing upon the long colonnade whickl surrounds the "United States," promenading and remarking upon the peculiarities in the guests, as they crossed and repassed each other on their return from the prings, when Mrs. Blair suddenly remembered she had not seen Rosa for the morning. Her mother remarked, she had not finished dressing when she left the chamber; but as ample time had now been allowed her to make her toilet, and she did not appear, a search was instantly commenced. Squire Sims knocked loudly at her door, and, receiving no answer, slowly opened the unlatched premises, where he found no occupant. Upon looking: 20    .   230   .  C  LE SAM'S PALACE; OR, hastily around, howevet, on her table he discovered a note which ran thus:'- Do not be anxious about me.

We break- fast in private. , . -' ^ROSA. This note produced no little excitement in the party to which Rosa belong;ed. Sims was nearly frantic; for he had witnessed the marked attentions of the .Spaniard to Rosa since the day after their' arrival, he having there been introduced to Uncle Sam as the proprietor of the house in Havana of the firm of- Mustang, Bend, -& Co.; and they solicited orders from TUncle Sam for the- intro- duction of a new species of cigars, highly fragrant, alid prized among the smoking gentry. Uncle Sam, in turn, then introduced the young gentleman to his niece, who happened to be present; and, firom that hour, her old lover had watched his attentions with most jealous solici- tude. Sims had, however, persuaded himself to believe that Rosa would never attach herself to an inveterate smoker, as well as vender, of an article which she, long i ago, had prohibited him from using; yet this young man would throw aside his weed, and with his breath perfectly   THE REIGNINtG KINO.      231 redolent, of Smoke, and nothing but smoke, he would bend down his tall figure to her dumpy form, and converse with the greatest salng froid in the world; and she, to his as- tonishment, inhaled the perfume as she would the delicious "verbena extract " from her gauzy, embroidered handker- chief. And yet, for her sake, he had foregone his habit of smokiing, and complied with every request which a co- quettish fancy had :made, just to be succeeded by a smok- ing- Spaniard, who, perchance, was ohly'playing the ,part of a deceitful lover. Yet that was better to bear than a r'eal one; and how did he know but he would really in- gratiate himself in her charms? Truly, Jolhn Sims, you are a doomed man. The 'affair of Rosa's flight exasperated Thomas Beals so, that he swore he would take vengeance into his own hands uponl their return; and neither Mr. nor Mrs. Blair could per- suade him to abandon his design, so that they trembled for future consequences. Young Beals had little fear of a dirk knife or a pistol. He had given and escaped a good many slashes, as well as random shots; and he was not intimidated in reveng- - ing himself upon "lthe Spaniard. He therefore stealthily - slipped a dirkl below the waisthands of a pair of large- checked pantaloons, which were made at the south, and walked about the :premises with a good degree of non- chalance, lot omitting to occasionally slake anew his in- satiable thirst by a glass of brandy, not very essentially  ' "  $  * ' i - . .   '232     UNCL :E 8AU'S PALACE; On, diluted; so that he was in readiness for an attack at any moment when the party s!lould drive up.   : TMrs. Blair grew more and more apprehensive for corn- ^ ing results. She would gently tap her brother upon the shoulder, and entreat him to desist from any violent acts, plecling, as her gentle nature always did, that, "-for fa- tler's sake, if no other, he would keep calm." 3 But stung to a wild frenzy by the' maddening poison le so freely quaffed, her entreaties were unieeded; and, for the first time in:her life, she even hoped he mlight be so overcome by liquor as to be powerless, and incapable for an attack when the party should arrive. Uncle Sam, however, branded all these proceedings as idle follies, the thing of magnitude with him being what related to his traffic, and a desire to cheat his conscience into the belief that 'to furnish the destructive agent to others was no very heinous sin. He was now   in the right place to strengthen the sentiments which lhe longed to approve. Here was no law, no restraint. Men of wealth and--fashion, who were accounted worthy men,- nay, even Christian men,-drank, daily dranl, hourly drank, if their inclination prompted.; and there was.- no "principle" called inMquestion. Here was untrammelled public opinion, just such as existed twenty years ago every .where. And then what sportive remarks were hurled. at the temperance cause! how they gloated over "its inoperative law and unsuccessful defenders '! Very   THE REIGNING KIxNG.       233 well. Talk on, geiltlcmen. A bad cause needs able ad- vocates.  . To men of business habits, this pleasure seeking' soon tires and satiates. Mr. Tims and M3[r. Blair could not en- dure the restraints of fashionable society, and as they had laid aside all foolish coquetry, and were plain married men, satisfied with their partners, and derived their prin- cipal- enjoyment from domestic intqrcourse, .the gay fri- volity -which characterized so many about them was un- heeded. 'They waled out to' enjoy the beauties of nature, and see the varieties whiech were abroad. Sauntering leisurely along, their attention was attracted by a placard, vlwhich was attached to a post, whereon was inscribed, "Temperance Lecture. This evening, at seven o'clock, Marcus L. Brown} the distinguished champion of the glo- rious cause, will lecture at Hall, to which all citizens and strangers are invited." Tims involuntarily stopped. Had he received an elec- tric shock, he iwould not have been more. suddenly arrest- ed. 'Marcus L. Brown!"   Yes, the very same name whichl had always awakened in Tims's mind the most un- pleasant associations. Blair, knowing nothing of -the matter, playfully remarked, "So, my friend, your. traffic is beginning to- be impeached even here; and when ten righteous men are found, the city is safe. We will go to-night, and hear this famous man."  Tims had a strong desire to do so, and, on his return, informed Uncle Sam :- 20    UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR,  of his determination, he gladly accepting the proposition to accompany them; to hear what "the mechanic" would say. The remarkable coincidence of his being in town just at the time of their sojourn, and a desire to hear his skill in lecturing, made them eager for the. hour to arrive; and quite a formidable party started from the "United States," to hear and vilify the arguments in favor of the cause.' Tims and Uncle Sam felt that in a multitude of counsellors there was safety. At the time appointed, Marcus Brown entered the hall, accompanied by a few distinguished friends. Tims had never seen him since the decided change in his fortune; but well did he remember their last interview. There were some dark dolngs in his conduct towards the Browns, for which, for years, his conscience had sorely troubled him. He would not have them again reawakened for half his wealth. The lecturer was a dignified, fine-looking gentleman, unostentatious, yet of that manly bearing which at once commands our confidence and esteem.  His style was earnest, yet bore a truthfulness in his statements which carried conviction to the hearts of his hearers. In the course of his lecture, he commented upon his first intro- duction into the field immediately preceding his downfall, even at the precise period when he resolutely pledged himself to be a man. He remarked, "I was on the high road to ruin. A man, in the guise of a good citizen, often   235   THE REIGNING KING.   urged me to take the accursed glass from his counter, when he was a petty retailer. The habit was daily strengthened, and various stratagems were used to induce me to surrender my property to his control. lHe em- ployed me, and paid me in liquor. At that time, I held A subordinate rank in a military company, to which this, my ellmy, belonged. We met at social parties. We had suppers for the company; and I generously footed the liquor bill. My waning reputation disheartened me; and how did he encourage me? I had but three hundred dol- lars in the world, but a rich treasure in an abused wife and four lovely children.; yet this traitor to my peace in- toxicated me; and in that hour I signed a note of hand for three hundred dollars, for which my only return was BRANDY. Upon reflection, in my sober moments, I called for a redress of the wrong thus inflicted on me. I threat- ened the force of the law; but the lawyer whom I had employed in my more prosperous days was himself acces- -:  sory to my ruin, since in his clique lay his spoils. He was an office seeker. He was soon after in Washington, a used-up man; and I have reason to know that my last three hundred dollars were advanced to this pettifogger, to pay his current expenses while residing in that city." Murmurs of indignation. here ran through the assembly. "In the hour of my degradation, I applied to 'my dis- guised friend for labor. One who had amassed a princely fortune by his heavy importations of choice liquors-    UNCLE SAM'S PALACE ; OR, who had sold my enemy thousands 'of hogsheads of the vile stuff- was now about erecting ' palace in the sub- urbs of his native city; and, to entangle me still further in his meshes, he gave me the superintendence of the la- bor. I entered upon my duties with a resolute determi- nation to do well; 'but this enemy again enticed me to drink, and then reported me to the millionnaire as a man unfit for his service. My all was mortgaged to him. All? Not all: my family were mine still, unworthy as I proved myself. My wife solicited that six months might be allowed before cutting off' ur equity of redemption. We were answered,' It is out of my hands. ' The lawyer has the settlement.' A writ of ejectment was issued, and we were houseless. But a kind- Providence yet brooded in mercy over us. The good pastor to whose church my wife removed hired a few rooms, and I procured a few jobs; but the harihearted creditor, who might lave re- lented, was himself in the clutches of the old man whose palace was being erected; and he dared show no mercy. The fangs of the viper fastened upon hiim. I was an out- cast, and for his hardheartedness he was revarded by that flinty old manl. He. encouraged him--nay, more, he re- ceived him into his firm; and when his deeds bf iniquity would have softened his heart by retrospection, he made' him callous to such sensibilities, until his seared con- science readily acquiesded, in all that bld millionnaire's requirements.   "Thlere was to be a temperance gathering that evening. - The plcede was taken by many, and my resolution to con- quer my foe prevailed. I signed the paper pledging' my- self to total abstinence; and from that hour not a drop of liquor has passed my lips. My wife received a small sum from her relatives in England; and we first rented, and afterwards purchased, a small cottage in the neigh- borhood of the city, our children were placed in good schools, and prosperity has since dawned upon me." Tre- mendous cheers here followed. And iin yonder corner sat Mr. Tims, Uncle Sam, and Squire Sims! The electric words had scathed their very souls. They looked pale, and walked out of the hall, feeling, undoubtedly, as all guilty people do feel, that they were gazed at by the whole assembly, as the men so truth- fully described. Tims was strangely affected. A cold perspiration stood on his brow, a faintness came over him, and he returned to his lodgings as one taken suddenly ill, to -the alarm of his wife. Uncle Sam 'seemed dull and taciturn. He had no playful remarks for his old asso- ciates, but, as usual when he was sick at heart, com- plained of his gout in the leg - a fact which Mrs. Blair well understood. She then gave him his anodyne, and he retired. Last of all was the agitated Simn seen walkino the colonnades rapidly, as in deep thought and pain- ful anxiety,' Mrs. Richard Bealsj supposing it was all attributable to Rosa's absence,'begged him to be quiet;   ,UNCLE SAMt'S PALACE; OR, but alas! he had two sources of unhappiness, and one agcravated the other. -le was really fearful that all their past iniquities were about to be heralded to the world- deeds which had long been buried in the waters of obliv- ion, as they all vainly hoped. But where is sleepless justice? Did they not know there was a registry where the recording angel never blotted out the offence, unless it were washed away by the tears of penitence? and those, surely, had never been shed. By and by, however, the scene again changed. Rosa and her party drove up in a splendid equipage. The clear moonlight made all countenances visible, and Thom- as Beals darted towards the, velicle as if he had risen from the ground. He stepped up fearlessly to M3ustang, and demanded to know " why he had inveigled his cousin to accept his attentions, when her affections were already pledged to another." The young Spaniard replied, "That is no concern of yours;" whereupon Thomas drew from his inner pocket a pistol, and flashed it in the Spaniard's face. The most profane oaths were uttered by the .Span- ish gentleman, as he boisterously inquired "what right the scapegrace'of a Yankee had to meddle with affairs which did not-concern him."  Young Beals was never tardy in giving an answer when full of liquor; so he manfully replied, "You are a mean, unprincipled scoundrel, to. entice the affections of my cousin, who is solemnly pledged to marry my friend;"   H   whereupon a roar of laughter was heard among the spec- tatoys, as so ludicrous an assertion was made touching the person of the man upon whom more than half a century's experience had laid an impress not now to be mistaken; for since he had been in such a panic respecting Rosa, the wrinkles had settled most strikingly under his eyes, and very recently some red flushes appeared upon his face, which would be likely to prove a serious barrier to his receiving many retainers, as an advocate for the anti- liquor law. Sims, however, , attempted to protect Rosa; but she quite indignantly resisted his attentions, twitching herself away from his person, and apparently anxious to interfere  in the contest, until she was conveyed from the scene by Mr. Blair, who led her off, in so resolute a manner, that all resistance was in vain. In the mean time, a large crowd had collected; and as the pale moonlight disclosed bloody noses and scratched faces, the young men were separated, every one seeming to justify the Spaniard in resisting an unprovoked attack, and criminating Thomas Beals, who was so intoxicated that he became furious. Uncle Sam had retired before the affray comrenced, and was not informed of it until the next morning; and that day the gout in his leg was intensely painful.  Rosa now loudly pleaded that her new beau, should be exonerated from all blame, declaring that it was her ,+S:i    240      UNCLE SAM^S PALACE; OR, sincere determination to attach herself to him hereafter, thus evincing her consummate weakness before she knew any thing of Mustancs character. Sims proposed an immnediate returz ; -for since, in so short a time, so many distressing occurrences .had taklen- place, he deemed it expedient to quit such an unfortunate spot. The whole party gladly accepted the proposition, save our little coquette; but her wisl was lost in the mi- nority, The gay bustle. and cheerful life in whichl our fidends at first partook suddenly lost their relish . No longer were they amused- at looking upon " nanagincg moth- ers," who seemed emphatically to. have ldaughters to sell," nor yet with gay widows, and their troops of' ad- mirers; for the fountains of pleasure were dried up, aned all, save Mr. and Mrs. Blair, sMeemed to be on the verge of retributive justice. And was it not a remarkable fea- ture in the case, that here, where all the restraints of sobriety were removed, where giddy pleasure held an undisputed sway, where no vigrorous law exacted obedi- ence, and no public opizion questioned the expediency of - free gratification, there yet was a law in thlemsetes - a harrowing consciousness which disturbed all their pleasant anticipations? Truly, vengeance seemed to pursue them. Rosa, however, managed to accept the present of a diamond ring, and carried away with her the daguerreo- type of the Spaniard, they promising mutually to keep   THE REIGNING- KING. -      241 {a diary" of their daily lives, and faithfully to transmit thlem to each other, until an interview, a few imonths henlce, sliould further consummate their designs. Why is it that parental influence thus to check such youtliful imprudences becomes so powerless when most needed?  When the first step is taken in coquettish im- prudence, how easily the next succeeds! until we hear the fond parent acknowledge, ' I have lost 'all power to, restrain mny child. She is so wayward and impulsive, I cannot govern her now "--a frank admission, neverthe- less too often a true one; and such a being was Rosa Beals. Our party, therefore, soon settled their bills, and made homeward tracks. None but Mr. and Mrs. B  lair seemed at peace with themselves. Sims, the bachelor, knew he nutst surrender his claim; his wig gave marks of the neg- lience, he felt to his outward appearance, being often displaced; lie grew attenuated and dull; he sometimes talked . foolishy, " as if he had nothing to live for," and showed a  manifest contempti for his business. Tims looked!aggard and uneasy; and Uncle Sam was sorely vexed; for Thomas was likely to prove a  profligate and ruined son. The sunshine seemed taken outof all their counternances not that life need to have been distasteful, only as a departure from the t -of rectitude will make it so.    / 21    242     UNCLE SAxM'S PALACE; OR, CHAPTE R XVII.

"How in the world did it come to pass so suddenly?" was the first exclamation of Mrs. Blair. "And yet it was the best thing that could have hap- pened," said Uncle Sam.             : "Why, what has happened?" inquires Mr.'. Bl ir of his wife.

The idea of youth and beauty seems to have a superadd- ed influence as the hair whitens and the furrows thicken. You vainly imagine in the charm of that volatile girl you would find quite substantial happiness; that she would "help to keep .you young;" and then' there would be a pride in introducing so sweet a creature as your wife. You imagine there is no great disparity in your [astes, after all;- that she is sensible, and will conform to your whims, or that you wouldbe willing to forego old habits at her dictation; and so you strangely interest yourself in, all her giddy pursuits, and dream that life would be more correspondent to that vision of your early years, if you thus gave your late affections to the keeping of so young and beautiful a being. But remember there is another side to the picture.

So we will leave our newly-married pair in their "Vermont home," while we again take a look around the palace, and see what is now agitating the occupants. j  Uncle Sam is examininig sundry bills that have just j been presented him on "Thomas's account." One is "for drivingm the roan horse, Highflier, immod- erately, thereby causing his death," which is set down at the damage of ' two hundred and fifty dollars.":  Another is " for damaging a rockaway, breaking springs, ' &c., seventy-five dollars." A third is from the dram shop and oyster saloon, of fashionable resort, "for a supp er given to six young men, champagne included, twenty-four dollars." Uncle Sam  mutters an oath. He is greatly vexed when he does this, and orders his -coachman to come to him. HHe reads the bills, and, in his ex'tremity, even in- quires of him what can be done with his son. He has   X not, however, ferreted out all his evil doings:; for John  -i I   THE REIGNING KING.       245 fells him that Vulcan hag been severely lamed by hard driving; that the spring to the new carryall has been broken; and that Thomas rwas returned in a bad plight last night, and was pitched into the gardener's house, on the premises, whereupon John -remarks, "And all this comes, sir, from licensing dram shops." "]Humph," replies the old man. ".-They are cussed holes, John, and no mistake." "If the law to abolish drink altogether could prevail,' quoth John, "Mr. Thomas would be a likely young man. A great deal is in him, sir; but he has bad asso- ciates; and they repute you to be worth your millions, sir, and say that you advocate the license system, sir; and here is the trouble. "If--if-I hardly dare say it, sir. It's not becoming in me to be impertinent; but if the young man could be sent where he could not find a drop of liquor, depend on it, sir, 'twould prove his salvation." Uncle Sam felt there was a great truth uttered here, and it set him thinking. At length he inquired, John, do you know a good place where I could put Tom? ' "I have a  real temperance brother in the State of Maine, sir. He goes for the new lawaltogether; says it has saved him and hundreds of others. I don't know, but I suppose, he would take your son, and make aw man of hiin.  Saving the use of liqor, Mr. Thomas is a fize - fellow; noble, generous traits; only that one thing takes 21*    246     UNCLE SAsMS PALACE; OR, all the ntanliness out of hint. I wish," said John, (and he twirled, his hat violently,)-"I wish he could be re- deemed ; for he will have it. in his power yet to do great good. with his money, when you shall have done with it, sir." Uncle Sam  sighed, most bitterly. Said he, 'John, here's a check for five hundred dollars. Will you take these bills, and settle them as if they were your own. Bring them to me receipted. That's all." "And shall I write to my brother about receiving the young man, sir?" "I wish you would, John; and, in the mean time, I'll talk with- my daughter and Blair upon the subject." John had done this long ago, and well knew their senti- ments; and thus, for a few days, the matter rested. After John closed the door, and Uncle Sam was left alone, what a variety of sensations pervaded his bosom! How naturally did he reyeit to the past! For a lifetime --ay, and a long one, too-how had he swelled the pile of retributive justice that seemed meted out to him! And now he was about to seek the protective influences of' that very law which he had so' violently contended against. Self-interest again prompted him to act contrary to his former course. The law he had vilified was made for others. Now it became' necessary for himnself, to secure peace in his home, and redeem the character of his; only son. is   THE REIGNING KING.    :   247 Was there no other way whereby his salvation could be effected? He hated the idea of becoming a convert, even under such necessity. Yet what had lhe left undone that would avail? Had he not, again and again, tried the force of moral suasion? And then low those old. arguments which his friends who pleaded for him to aban- don his hostility rose before him! Again parental solici- tude was excluded. He supposed his son was. dead; and almost in a frenzied desperation, he would exclaim, "Would to God it had so proved!"  Still again came the thought of a restoration. E'ven the coachman, John, had suggested, if he couldl but be cured of this one vice, his manliness would return. And now how strongly those parental instincts appealed to him for succor and deliverance, let it come when and where it might! As it was, Thomnas was an insufferable guest at home or abroad. Every clday he abancdoned himself to the use of ardent spirits, in some form. If he went penniless from his home, he wobuld soon encounter a party of his old associates; and together they would hie to. some Isaloon," where inebriating draughts were quaffed. And when his father supposed he had broken up such associa- tions, and the " saloon" was deserted, the "fashionable hotel" had its open or private bar, from which his appe- tite could be fully satiated. In these excited, moments, his comrades could easily persuade him to procure an out- fit from some livery stable; and being now well recognized e '   UNCLE SA31'S PALACE; OR,  as "the rich man's son whose father would settle what he was unable to do,'? without difficulty, he obtained horses and carriages to convey his friends to any race ground, or neighboring establishment in our country villages, where "fast young men" meet for purposes connected with gam- ing, fowl shooting, or other similar purposes, which gener- ally ended in a " smash up" to the vehicle, a scratched face, and sometimes a sprained limb, while the wonder to all observers was how they could have escaped with their lives. "iving under such a continual dread of fatal conse- quences, and forced to meet unexpected debts, Uncle Sam was driven to that last resqrt, the law, which effectually piohibited the sale of an article which produced such slocking results. And ye lie old pride of pQsition-  the feeling that he was- o to surrender the principle upon which, and for whic i'l  had ever been the cham- pion and advocate, dro him almost:to desperation. In- wardly he loathed himself and all his works. these thoughts, too, continually prqyed upon his peace, bedause they must be privately borne. If he mentioned them to his daughter or her husband, he well knew he had 'no weapons with which he could meet such powerful assail- ants. If he opened the subject to Tims, why, it was only rekindling a fire which, fqr months, he had kept smoth- ered in his breast; and as to Parson Grazewell; he -had not much confidence in his judgment; for although he had   THE REIGNING KING.       249 ever found him ready to yield to his principles, yet he felt there was an insincerity, a reluctance to avow manly sen- timents, for fear of contradiction, or worldly loss. And do we not despise, in our secret hearts, those very friends whom we secure, if that friendship is not based upon the highest standard of moral conviction? And what good would it do, should he summon his old plausible legal adviser, Sims, from his comfortable quarters? He knew just how far he would follow the argument; and now he was not anxious to know about "the constitutionality of the anti-liquor law," nor was he puzzled to divine whether a "repeal" would follow, or "extended licenses" would be current. O, no. All his anxious inquiry seemed now to turn on the, plain, simple question, "Is there a spot where my son may be placed out 'of the reach of temptation?" and his whole heart cried out, "If there be such an asy- lum, let me patronize it." Truly, these were new thoughts with which Uncle Sam was contending; but they were tremendously harrowing to pursue. It did sometimes seem as if the book of re- membrance was unsealed before his vision, and his right- eous doom was foreshadowed, so that no earthly palliatives could appease his awakened conscience. And those secret whispers which inquired why he had so long withstood the searchings of that prompter which again and again had revealed the sinfulness of the traffic-those argu- ments, as if from the spirit land, seemed reiterated by   250     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, that departed brother--not revealed by earthly mediums or ghostly spectres, but written by his oiwn hand, as he was on the verge of eternity. And now, last of all, the parental instincts,'which surnmounted'all these impressive warnings, must they not, with scorching blasts, have swept through the chambers of memory, over which self-interest and a desire to sustain public opinion HJad set a seal, or carefully kept Iocked in the painful past? So that when the heart of the old man throbbed almost to bursting, the only sympathy which he now sought was from his coach- man, John, who, although in a servant's capacity, laid a noble heart to pity, and a generosity of nature whihl could readily forgive the mistakes of a, whole life, pro- vided there -was a disposition to retrace past errors. Do not smile, my friend, because the rich millionnaire chose his coachman for his sympathizing friend, in his day of trouble. Does not poor human nature often resort to feeble means for sustaining strength? With John he hacl perfect freedom. He was not fearful of being accused as a seceder from his party--as a traitor who had left the ranks of his friends; but. in the simple expressions of such -a man hle heard the dictates of commoni sensse un- warped by party feeling; and these were tones to whci Uncle Sam was not habituated.    :. He, however, looked intently into Johns face for a mo- ment, while a hesitating, half-expressed sentence seemed about to fall from his lips. At length he inquired, "Have ,        i-        *d    THE REIGNING KI NG   '     251 you a copy of the anti-liquor law, John? My good fel- low," said he, " would you believe that I never read the lawin my life? I only knew it was prohibitory, and that it affected my moneyed interest; but I don't know, John, but I shall be obliged to try its practical effects upon Tom."            ^  "'Twould work like a charm, sir," replied John. "In- deed, I know no other way to save him, sir. I think, too, it would give you great peace of mind to reflect that you availed yourself of such a safety rope, sir." "But, John, what will be said of me if I thus yield to ; these convictions? There's a party, you know, wtlo would forever hold me in derision for leaving them." ' And there's your son, sir, who will be lost to you un- less he avails himself of the benefit; and it must come through you, sir." John appeared to gain confidence, and he added, "Which, sir, is of the most consequence to you, the friendship of liquor venders, or the reformation of your only son? That settles the question, Mr. Beals. I hope I'm not too forward in my remarks, sir." c- Uncle Sam patted John on the shoulder as Me replied, "You've been with me many years, and always proved yourself a consistent man, John.  I respect your opinion. You know my trials. I'll examine the copy we spoke 'about.  Go, now, and bring it to me." John came immediately back, bringing the paper con- taining the anti-liquor law in full, as it now stands, unre- ,            UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR,           I pealed. Uncle Sam closed his door, and began to exam- ine the law for the first time. "It is stringent," muttered he, "and that is the reason I have quarrelled about it; but what less than this will give the remedy Iseek? If my son can get any liquor at all, the appetite becomes unappeased; and he is wild until he drinks to excess Well this cuts off the license system only for medicinal purposes; and why. should it not, to be consistent? If there is a place where the stuff can be bought, Tom will avail himself of it. I suppose Blair is right, and Tims was right years ago; and there's brother Dick;" and, for the first time since the day Squire Sims read to him that document he' went to his private drawer, and took it out, and' read it over. Uncle Sam was not aware that any one had heard him in his cogitations; yet Mrs. Blair sat in an anteroom, and, with her brother Thomas, heard his low mutterings. Thomas seemed deeply moved by the intensity of his fa- ther's anguish on his accqunt; and he said to his sister, as they soon after talked together, "I would be thankful to reform, if I knew how to begin." "Do tell father so, then," replied Mrs. Blair. "It will so delight his heart to feel that you are willing to yield yourself to redeeming influences; and, Thomas, think what a dear brother you will become to me, if you only subdue this propensity." And she sent him to his father's room.    THE REIGNING KING.    253   There was a struggle, painfully exciting, upon the part of both father and son. Convictions that had been iopg resisted now pleaded for a rehearing in the father's breast; and arenewed determination to reform led the son to repeat many old promises; but how did he strengthen his father as to his duty in this particular? "I can never reform," remarked Thomas, "while there are so many baits to entrap me. Father, it is the licensed saloons and the hotel bars that continually keep me in my slavish debasement. I resolve, on leaving home, to return a sober man; but I am met by some acquaintances, and I am not manly enough to withstand their invitations; and I drink one glass. Then my desire to drink another succeeds, and I become wild and giddy; and you know the rest." "Indeed, child, I do; and I am going to turn about, and direct my influence toq another channel. I mean to advocate the anti-liquor law, Thomas, in future." "That's the true way, father, to root out drunkenness. The law must be put in force, without such a license sys- tem as we have had; for I can procure liquor almost any where. I don't know what people quarrel so about. Every intemperate man I converse with acknowledges the law is none too stringent, if we mean to effect a ref- ormation. I think, father, the opposition is mainly on account of pecuniary interests involved in the traic." Just so, my son. I'm glad to hear you reason like a 22  -   254      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, man. It puts new life in me. Thomas, I've been talking about your reformation with John; and he says he has a real, pledged temperance brother, who. lives where the law is operative; and he is an excellent farmer. Now, what do you say, my son, to going there until we bring about a state of society lere that will not so endanger you?" "I would'vote with both hands to go there, sir. I wish I could be sent to-day." ,: e added, "There are a great many reasons why I wish to reform;" and then he hesi- tated, as if he had said enough; but he brushed away a tear, and left the room. Uncle Sam next talked- with his daughter - she who always strengthened him in his good purposes. We can- not narrate all they said:; but the old man wondered he lhad never before minutely examined what he had been contending against. He even went so far as to say he did not believe but many would be convinced of their error in such Wilful opposition, if they would caImly ex- amine the necessity which made an" anti-liquor law indis- pensable. He thought over the domestic ties which sur- rounded the most inveterate condemners of the law. None oA their dearest treasures had fallen victims to in- temperance, that he could recall to his. memory. They only looked at it in a selfish view, just as he had done for years.  But it is never too late to confess our errors, ^father,"   THE REIGNING KING.-       255 replied Mrs. Blair. "It is so manly not to resist convic- tions of duty, that one always gains the respect of the wise and unprejudiced;-and then the consciousness that we have risen .out of olr foggy, narrow views, into the bracing atmosphere of truth, always -makqs one feel a conscious dignity in his new position which he would not exchange again for all 'the bribes which wealth can bestow.. Money is nothing, you know, father, to inward quietzess of mind."  "Eunice, child, I believe you are an angel, sent to strengthen me. I feel all you say is too true; and if we can but bring about Thomas's reformation, do you suppose I will ever again fight against the means which procured "t ?         " "And we will ask God to assist us," replied the con- scientious daughter. "He never frowns upon our sincere endeavors to do right."' The father nodded, his assent. And now Awe will see how soon after the old manuwas made to attlst the con- victions that he had Dxpressed to his children. Just at this time, an enemy of the law called on Mr. Beals for funds wherewith ltheir- opposition could be main- tained, this being an object upon which Uncle Sam had hitherto freely lavished his money. His friend quickly detected a change in the old man's feelings; for he even expressed the thought that he wished, he might never   25 6     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, again be troubled with the subject; for, remarked he, ,after all, "We must have the law." 3 1ust have the law, do I understand you to say, 3Ir , "Beals? What widow's plea has operated so powerfully oni your, heart, just now'? Surely, you are not about to flinch from your long-established principles, and thlus jeop- ardize Such large investments of property as are exposed to those engaged'in the traffic." " Well, well," said Uncle Sam, "I have been lookin'g at this matter as I never gave it attention before. Hitherto I have had my liquors safely loJged in my cellar. They were a harmless enemy, under lock and key. I ordered them brought out, as my frienld desired. I never drank. immoderately myself, as you wpll know; for I have al- ways despised a drunkard.

"  Well, I thought I could govern his appetite by closely watclhing him, and keeping the article out of his reach, and not furnishing him with means to obtain it; but, sir, r I find I was mistaken. He will find a friend or old corn-  panion, who decoys him in the city to those cuzssed saloonls, where they drink, then gamble, -or drive off to some othel' rendezvous; and!" am obliged to foot the bills-a thlng not so important, either, as the. mortjifcateion of having a child with such a depr aved apyetit. I have beeln thinking r           p et i   THE REIGIN/O KING.       257 overt this matter- deep thoufghts, I assure you. Thoughts I did not wish to have knockinfg at the door, have come' unbiddeln; and I lave, in my imaginings at such times, cut off the licenses from petty dram shops and saloons of faS,]lionable resort; and when Thomas obeyed my interdiction not to, enter these, why, at the first-class hotels, some young man was sure to give him the first glass; and then it, was all over-; for when his appetite, is fed in a small way, it craves further gratification; and he returns home as you, sir, would not have a son H of yours, provided there was any way, under God's hleaven, to prevent' it. And now, in the name of hu- manity, I ask you, Is there any way to redeem my son but by a law which effectually prevents him from -procur- ing, the article?"  The retailer looked abashed, as well as astonished, and replied, "But, sir, we did not expect a desertion from this quarter in our ranks. You have ever been our steady friend; we could count on you as willing to face any, almotint of funds; and, just now, we are anxious for a further addition, as we, engaged in the -traffic, are determined to conquer or die in the cause. We, have already, as you lknow, .a heavy reserved fund with which to wasge the battle; but if we are prohibited from calling on you to aid us, how can we look .to weaker props to sustain us? Admitting yjou have an inebriate son, does it follow that, for him, a law must be made which shall   2"58    UNCLE SAMkI'S PALACE; OR, jeopardize my interests? Must your interest work my -downfall?" Uncle Sam grew indignant. The very arguments he had used for years to others were now tauntingly thrown at him; and he would not bear them. He lastily re- plied, "I have made sacrifices enoughl on account of the traffic. I have given my money as freely as if it were dug from a mine of gold. I have advocated the piarty through .every discouraging aspect. I hlave in. curred enmity and disgrace, as I now look upon the thing; and yet you demand the fillther sacrifice of my child. He shall not be laid upon your infernal altar. I i  will, if necessary, the rather knock 'in the head of every butt and 'quarter cask in my store, than peril him any longer. No," continued he, " you must not ask mlle for funds to carry on this traffic. If I escape imy future doom by repentincg of what I have done, God be praised; but don't ask for more." -  - Uncle -Sam, now he was -beginning to avow his con- victions, seemed to be changed in the ,style of his phrase- ology. We see a :marked purity in his conversation, somewhat, different from, his former vulgarities; and is it wonderful that so cleansing a process a's the rilght aspect of the temperance question involves should affect the lan- guage, as'the mind clearly discerns its purifying effects? and he thus. continued:-: "I have now, sir, laid open my heart as I, did not '  -.         ,       THE REIGNING KINOxG.-      259 intend. .Never before have I uttered myself aloud in this lu"anner; but the" crushing weight of parental obliga- tion compels. me to conceal no longer what I see the dire necessity of supporting--the law." ("Perhaps, sir," replied the retailer, "these are only passionate words, uttered in your hour of perplexity. I shall not publish them uas coming from a man whom  we have so highly esteemed, and whose name we have borne so triumphantly upon our list as a foremost leader." "Mr. Flinn," replied Uncle Sam, " no gassy language or flattering commendation will now avail. Report me or not, as you choose. I have been too long entangled in such meshes. I have too long resisted the pleas of humnanity. Nor am I a sudden convert. I have wilfully closed my eyes for years upon the destructive process of intemperance; and the last bribe money I paid to secure voters stung mie to the quick, as a criminal deed, although I silently consented to the act,"   ' - ' And so I suppose, Mr. B1eals, you will now herald all our business transactions to the friends of the law. A pretty detail will be thus furnished, wherewith they will strengthen their cause. In the name of all-th at-is honor- able and manly, promise me that you will not betray us. All parties have secret influences to effect the results they desire.

"So we are all, all despicable. Wiy -have I suffered myself to be so entangled, just to keep in fav:or with a party, just to support my gains in the traffic, and just to mislead others in the destructive way? I know I may seem like a maniac to you, Flinn, in my remarks; but an aroused conscience speaks out in firm tones; and where it has long been pent up, when it vents its indignation, it does so earnestly. -I have no apologies to make. My heart is oppressed, and cries out for deliverance." Flinn was more and more astonished. This was deser- tion in the -igh places. It would prove a fatal blow to the party, a mighty influence to operate on public opin- ion, a heavy drawhack upon their future -plans, and, per- chance, an incentive to others to become baptized M'it h the same spirit; for did he not know many whose moral con- victions almost turned against worldly advantage? Yet what was to be done? Uncle- Sam was inflexible. It -1\ -would not be judicious to try to bring him over. He was  still of sane mind and sTw-:' judgment; and so the least said upon the matter the better. Flinn left him with deep regret thus to separate.   THE REIGNING KING.        261 CHAPTER XVIII. Thomas Beals is placed in a Home where the Anti-Liquor Law prevails. - Descript-ion of a Temperance Village. - Tims's Convictions. - A MAass Convention held at the Palace.- Knocking out the Bungs. - Uncles Sam's Conversation with  Parson Grazewell. THE arrangements for the removal of Thomas Beals from the reach of temptation were about completed;' and he continued quite pleased with the idea of being. emanci- pated from, the power of evil associates. Many an affec- tionate appeal had been addressed to him by his sister, and many an ,urgent solicitation had been set forth, that, by being restored to sobriety, he could become a useful / citizen, and an inheritor of vast wealth, with which she always planned he could help redeem those who, like him, were debased by the free use of liquor; for her generous nature always-contrived some amelioration of lhuman woe by earthly possessions, probably feeling that the property her father had accumulated was mostly wrung from hiiu man suffe!xng, when traced to its true source: she felt as all true, noble-hearted people db feel, that its appropriation ought to be devoted to allaying the evil- it had engendered. 'While Thomas's" outfit was preparing, there seemed to * b * ;9   262     -UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, be something which preyed upon his mind that he dared not divulge. Mrs. Blair, supposing it was some account of ill luck- at the gaming tcable, never pressed him for an explanation; and he went away with his, untold secret. The 'morning of their departure was a delightful one The hot rays of a summer's sun -were tempered by a cool bree e, and the copious showers of the precedingc day caused all nature to smile. John, the coachman, had . trimmed his horses with fly nets and green bouglls; and having been kept on high:feed, some days, for this intend- ed journey, they were antic and showy in the extreme. To amuse Thomas, his father suggested that he should take the reins whien they were fairly under way; and with varied conversation and occasional stops,'riding through a romantic and picturesque country, the whole way passed off finely, the journey occupying three days by carriage, while the fleet steam horse took only a few hours to complete it.  :Thomas Beals would' have made an excellent farmer, had he been early trained to the occupation; but rich men then" felt that they could do: better with their sons than cause them to hold or drive the plough. It was a sad mistake with many thus to judge of an enlightened agriculturist, who is now coming to be viewed as occupy- ing one of the most enviable and exalted positions which is assigned to toiling humanity. Uncle Sam was only associated with a farm just enough   THE REIGNING   KING.      263 to thnkl of cdrudgery and a hard lot, whereby one could not accumulate money; and the heavy demands his business had sitnce made upon his time had not essentially changed his .opinion. He had not read many scientific journals which treated of modern improvements in husbandry; but he was, in truth, the owner of the land upon which hd Irl was now taking his- son. John had obtained money from his master to purchase the farm, giving him a mort- gage of the same; and then he let it to his brother, to whom we are about to introduce our readers. Thomas Beals was acquainted with this fact, which cir- cumstance gave him more interest in the premises; for, now he was about tryinog another. course of life, his ideas did not expand to obtain any higher position than to be- -come owner of a country house and a few acres of land. But why did he covet a house, without a blithesome wife to occupy it? We will not answer the question just now, but take a glance at the occupants and premises, at which Joln has just halted, and, in a most familiar manner, is signifying, by a: most vociferous" ihoa," that they have actually arrived, where they are most cordially received, and an air of thrift was every where apparent.. Farm- er George was a hale, robust man, with a countenance full of cheerful merriment. His wife bore marks of a cultivated intellect, and, by the agreeable tone of her conversation, completely won -Uncle Samn's heart; and Thomas thought she resembled his sister. A daughter, ! I f 1    264   -  uNCLIr SAM's PALACE; OR, eighteen years of age, moved about with great alacrity; and although diffident, and unable to speak without a deep blush, yet -she conversed sensibly, and appeared no way deficient in a good understanding. The son, a young man of twenty, was laboring in an ladjoinin g field. While the dinner was in preparation, Captain George Trealdwell pro- posed that his guests should take a. look over their pleas- ant village. As. they were doing so, the captain often called upon his company to stop and listen to his, varied. accounts of the beneficial workings, of the temperance law. "You   observe," said he, "that old, dilapidated  house upon the opposite side of. the .street. That, two years ago, was a rum tavern. Many is the man that re- members the terrible scenes he has there 'itnessed, before the passage of our law. There were seasons when a riot- ous spirit more especially prevailed, such as' muster days,' -'town  meeting days,' and whenever the militia ,met, and particularly when there was any agitating ques- tion in the town  to be settled by vote, it was a common practice 'to treat' certain members, in order to secure their votes. This, in the end, always produced a riotous spirit, which was seldom quelled until the poor inebriates, in their besotted condition, lay in piles upon broken set- tees, or were carried home in 'a state of horrible stupor. A   town meeting came, at length, to- be looked upon as a scene of disgraceful procedure. The landlord drank, and his son followed the example, until, by and by, they   . '    THE REIG'INiG KING.       265 became unfitted for any sort' of employment; andd the tavern was about being closed up, when one of the fathers of the town, a stanch friend of temperance, agreed to re- lease the premises to the old landlord, on condition he, would become a pledged man.  To save himself from ruin, the old man consented, and so did the son. I would like to have had you witness the change at our next election of town officers. Scarcely a man was' seen hov- ering round the portals of that tavern, unless he had busi- ness with some other man. Long before sundown, every citizen wass safely returned to his home; and the greatest Unanimity prevailed. There never was such an argument in favor of the anti-liquor law witnessed before. In a mnonth or two, however, Sylkes, the landlord, concluded he had rather change his business; and he turned farmer. The old house was closed, and has never been reopened. One of our citizens has just bought it, and is to repair and open it upon temperance principles; for we need a public house among us." Passing on a few steps, they again halted. "This is' the residence of Sykes, the old rum landlord, about whom we were speaking. See how neatly he has trimmed up his hedge, and ho'w finely his gravel walk is laid out to to his front door. The man is thoroughly renewed, gen- tlemen, since he quit liquor J Uncle Sam-, h ad seen Sykes, sad -soll him liquor years ago; but he kept the secret. 23   266     UNCLE SAI'S PALACE; OR, As they further -proceeded, the white dwellings, and the neat, and even tasteful, outhuildings, all indicated thrift,. while upon the highest bill in the village stood an elegant carved figure-head, .not unlike what we sometimes, see upon our steamboats. They were- told that the man who resided here was formerlyy a, master of a vessel, anll anl intemperate man; but, years ago, lie reformed, and placed on his summer house, upon that height of land, the figure, Which he named the "Goddess of 7em'rperance; and as she now ruled' the destinies of the whole village, she might well cast her smililg countenance upon the inhab- itants she overlooked. Thus had Temperance not only increased the thlrift, but she had improved the taste, of the villagers; for, as Cap-, tain Treadwell remarked, " what was saved by the relin- quishment of liquor would soon build a tasteful cottage for any man." During this walk, they frequently were accosted by men who were going to and returning from their laborious pur- suits. Every one looked a personification of his newly- adopted principles. There were ing ragged cllildreni no shabbily-dressed loafers, no hats from broken panes of glass, no fences broken down, and overrun with, nettles. Uncle Sam was touched. He never felt the n1eed of an entire surrender more keenly than at the preselt moment. He had no, misgivings about his recent declarations in de- fence of the law. Hlis misgiving-s were at his, withholding   -      THE REIGNING KING.        267 his influence so long. What could the most violent op- poser of the law have found for an argument to support his position here? Even Captain Treadwell himself was a reclaimed man. Formerly he had been the commander of a small fishing schooner; but he was never long suc- cessful. Sometimes he made unprofitable voyages,; some- times he was overtaken by gales, and driven into ports for repairs, and sometimes he was "top-heavy" himself, which, after all, was the secret of his ill success. But he aban- doned the sea and the use of liquor simultaneously, became a farmer, and, ever since, had been prospered by good crops, a kind brother, (John, the coachman ) and he ivas now a useful citizen, and a leading member of society. John had bought the farm at a bargain, and mortgaged it to Uncle Sam; so that, by carefully laying by his earn- ings, he hoped, at no distant day, to redeem it. But our party have returned to that cheerful home, and a well-spread table awaits them. There are grateful hearts - and cheerful voices ; and Uncle Sam felt that a cottage, were 'sobriety and decorum. reign supreme, is even pref- erable to a palace. Thomas was safe in the keeping of such a family. He even thought he should be happy, there himself; for there was a tranquil contentment, un- disturbed by the petty annoyances with which he had long been surrounded, by adherence to his party. Thomas felt its power, and was resolved to try the influence upon   268 '       CLE SAM'S PALACE; O, himself .which had so wonderfully changed those, about him; and the eceouraging tones of Captain Treadwell's voice had a powm rful influence upon his good resolutions. This is an important consideration in the work of re- form. 1Be careful always to place a pledged individual where he will be encouraged, and, if possible, furnish hm with that empl2oynent best adapted to his taste. Little things greatly affect character; but to those who are struggling to obtain a victory over evil habits thtey are no trinJes. Perchance the young man in question, had he been more closely watched, and early influenced by pa- rental counsel, would have escaped the foe which now destroyed his peace. Yet it may be so ordered by Prov- idence, that such signal deliverances shall be wrought out to- exhibit the weakness of men who rely upon their own unaided strength. At evening, Captain Treadwell showed that he incor- porated a religious trust with daily iabor, and implored divine strength to enable him to keep :in the true path. He read some passages which came home to Uncle' Sam's conscience with Withering force, such as, "Thou hast set my secret sins in the light of thy countenance;" and this t so agitated the old man's heart, that, after prayer, he in- quired of Captain Treadwell about his ideas of a 'future x judgment, and seemed anxious to have the query an- "swered, " whether our secret sins would, in the day of judg- ment, be made manifest to an assembled universe, or that A /                     *      THE REIGNING KING.       269 each soul would be so convicted by the awakened power of memory, that it would acknowledge the justice of its condemnation, without-the intervention of mercy - a very agitating question to Uncle Sam, who felt he had been one of the chief of sinners; for since he changed his ar- guments in support of the law, he found the religious ele- 2nent in his nature was not so easily stifled. Captain Treadwell and he pursued such inquiries till a late hour; yet Uncle Sam was not weary with the conversation. Day by day, however, he6 saw Thomas becoming' more at home, and willingto engage in agricultural labor. He had already selected a few acres of choice land, whereon he proposed to plant an orchard, his. father promising him that he would send him some hundreds of well- selected fruit trees; so that the family where he lived had. a superadded motive to treat him with affectionate care.    Uncle Sam now proposed to John that they should return; and as they did so, many a scheme was devised whereby a benefit should accrue to all parties; and it did really seem as if the old man's smothered humanity began to reassume its rightful authority. On his return, he was gladly welcomed by his daugh- ter; and the pleasing picture which he drew of the effects of the temperance movement, and of her brother's safety, completely overjoyed her. "My dear father," she could not but exclaim, "it is worth more than all the mine 23*   270      UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, of gold you could bestow upon me to knorw that you are a convert to this doctrine. It is what Mr. Blair and I have prayed for, have hoped for; and now the realization makes us an undivided' household."  Uncle Sam was, moved. Think you his full heart regretted the announce- ment of convictions that had long preyed upon his peace? It is time, quite time, that Mr. Tims should speak to us. After Uncle Sam's disclosure to his old friend who came to solicit the funds wherewith to-fighlt, the store was liter- ally besieged, to ascertain the truth of the rumor- that thiey had lost their zealous supporter; yet as Tims was- not informed of it by any direct avowal, he could only give evasive answers. He was shocked at the barbarity with whichl his old friends treated the subject. "He is a demented old fool," exclaimed one. "Driven to madness by a drunken son;', remarks an- other. "The old man has got his millions, and he may well turn traitor," says a third. r Indeed, nof one conceded that an honest conviction had induced the change. Is it not so, whenever we leave a party whose principles are questionable, that they will impute every motive but a sincere one to the seceder? , Tims, therefore, early consulted withll Uncle Sam on his return, and a long interview followed. We have already seen! that his convictions of the sin of the traffic were, !-  . ,       . /  --   ; -  '   TIE IREIGNING KING.       271 stifled by Uncle Sam's entreaties and threats; and we; may well suppose tha, if reawakened, the desire to change his business would be more likely to follow. Ever since the lecture by Brown, Tims .had felt discon- certed. He had attempted to quiet his conscience by re- storing the money he did take from the then degraded man; for he had enclosed 'in a note the sum of 'five hun- dred dollars, which, by way of raillery, he added, " would, h trusted, prevent him from ever again repeating the tt le- which had so vexed his soul;" while, in reply, Brown said, "Should I tell the stoiy again, be assured, 3r. Tims, I shall not forget to ad the afterpiece." Uncle Sam soon perceived that a new set of visitors now frequentedl the palace. Brawe temlperance men caled to give him the right hand of fellowship; and, what was the best featuredof all, many who had been swayed iby his example, yet had long felt convinced of their unsound position, now courageously avowed them- selves friends of the law; and letters from almost, every town in the state announced to him their approbation of tlje stand he had tken. Uncle Sam soon proposed a mass convention, to meet da his palace, and senthis invitations far and near, that a i lrge assemblagemight be present.  How different was this from all his former entertain- ments  Here were judgles, senators, representatives, men of talent, and men of principle. The palace was not   Z' iZ -  i UNCLE SA1M'S PALACE, OR, full; for those who ought to have ,entered it' were not there; Non-committal men; men who doubted the ex- pediency' of making tAe lawz; men whllo doubted whether, if .it were made, it could; be sustained; men lwho had large wealth i, tthe traffic, and purblind men who advo- cated higher claims than poor humanity's call, because property, to them, ought'to be " legally and religiously pro. tected; " and that large class of men who are dependent upon public breath and office; and, last of allreligious men,  ministers of the gospel of Christ, who preached the necessity of regeneration,-" npany of these, with one consent, began to, make excuse."  yet, like thefeast in the Gospels, the halt and the blind, the maimed and the outcast, were compelled to enter; and the palace was full. And was not eveey guest filled with a joyous heart? and was it not right they "should make merry and be glad "? since those. who were lost were found, and those who were dead were restored to life. But what means that shout from ',tlhe multitude? Whence issues-that stream the odor of which brings frest recollections of distress and want so vividly before. many of this assembly? Why, Uncle Sam has ordered John, the- coachman, to become his temperance agent; and pot a butt; puncheon, hogshead, or quarter, cask has escaped his heavy blow. He has beheaded them all, and they are furiously disgorging their contents. And what a supper was spread for those guests! Tell      THE REIGNING KING.       273 me not that we need the enlivening draught to make our spirits glad; that, without wine, our social feasts degen- erate into dulness; that the healthful pulse needs the ac-  celeration of the poisonous cup; for here was genuine mirth, yet so chastened, that no succeeding reaction made the past loathsome to contemplate; but all was as sun- shine without a Cloud.  Uncle Sam had invited the Rev. Mr. Grazewell to be present at this entertainment; but he declined 'he privi- lege; whereupon his parishioner appointed a dy for an interview, which took place atno distant period; and we cannot withhold some of the conversation which then passed between them. Here, again, we are called to remark upon the correct language with which Uncle Sam  clothed his thoughts. Indeed, the purity of his thoughts seemed to keep pace with the chastened character of his convictions.  "I have been thinking," remarked Uncle Sam  to the clerical gentleman, " that had the pulpit been a more efi- cient organ, many would have been converted, long ago, to " the! doctrine of tenzmperance. This may sound oddly, com- ing from  me, who always expressed the greatest satisfac- tion with the manner you have treated the. subject. You must know, 'however, that, for years, I have with difficulty winked out of sight the convictions of my 6wn conscience'; and the voices fi o-m the -pulpit to which- I have listened have been to me as a siren song to lull my half-awakened   274     - UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, conscience.- When I first conversed with you upon this subject, I did secretly hope you would forever quiet my disturbed feelings. I tried to make olut plausible argu- disturb ed  feeli ngs. .. ments, inself-defence; and sometimes I gained a partial vindication for myself to continue in the traffic; but Prov- idence sent upon me such a powerffl motive for my en- tire abandonment' of my former course, that now I cannot see how-.others could prop me up with such specious ar- rguments."                  . "But," replied Mr. Grazewell, "had I preached any other doctrine, you would have closed the door against me, and either allied yourself to another, or quit the house of God altogether. I am no party man, Hr. Beals--no agitator. I never saw the necessity of driving the subject of temperance with a; sledge hammer into my parishioners' hearts. I have always uttered the prayer, that ' an end might be put to intemperance and its kindred vices;' and no man respects sober, discreet citizens more than .I do." - But," pursued Uncle Sam, "youw ought to be influ- % enced by a higheir law than my desire that you should yield to muy prejudices. This non-committal course kept me still more blindfolded in error; for I always reasoned with myself, Well, here are men set apart to point out the dangerous sins of our times; and if my calling is such an aggravated one, would they be- bribed by worldly con- siderations to keep silent?' " Mr. Grazewell here interposed. "Sir, this subject has   THLE REIGNING KING.        275 occasioned, not only myself, but. our whole association, a great deal of uneasiness; for we have desired to meet the wants of our'people, not to gloss over their sins, neither to deal so harshy with them as to drive them out of the sanctuary. In nearly all our congregations, there were men connected with societies and churches who had more - or less interest in the traffic of ardent spirits. They were wealthy men, of the stamp of yourself, sir.- They were sensible men, who held our public offices, and presided, over our political interests; and, with the exception of their occztpation , they were righteous men. It was harsh juclgment to look such men in the face, and say to them; 'You are perilling your souls.' Mr. Beals, I hold that- every man is responsible for his own sin.; and I ;have yet to learn that I am accountable for the different manner with which we judge of various subjects. "Among as was yourself; Deacon Tibbetts, who is a retired distiller; Captain Bates, who has 'for many years been engaged in the liquor trade; Mr. Tims, your part- ner;  ir. Slow, the clerk of our society; Jethro Edwards, and Squire Holiday- all our first men.   So, then, any appeal to give to foreign missions, to promote education, to p'ay regular instalments for the support of the poor, for the cause of seamen, for tie interests of the town, and the good of society in general, has always met with a, ready response.  I have never felt like telling such men  they were invoking the displeasure of their Maker by   276     UNCLE SAM S PALACE; OR, continuing in their traffic. I may be wrong, but if so, I pray that I may be enlightened." ' It is just this-- talk," replied Uncle Sam, "that keeps aup the delusion that men can gain their thousands by a sinful trade, and yetf atone for all the evil by giving small, paltry sums to arrest vice in general. Mr. Grazewell, until you ministers adopt a more independent course, you are responsible for the sacrifice of the souls thus jeop- zardized. Is not the pulpit always accounted one of the most popular and sure means of arresting misguided opin- ion? Are not the incumbents generally accredited pious men, who would not wink at flagrant sins? Now, why is this evil so palliated, unless it be from motives of self- interest-the feeling that the doctrine of abstinence would not meet public opinion, and that it would conflict with hleavy tax-paying members of our religious societies? I am afn old man, Mr. Grazewell; and, thalnk God;"I am, at length, an awakened one; yet never, in any of our social conversations, have you adverted to the subject of my business - never but to justify me in the opinion of others. I never had but one faithful pastor; and he used to talk in plain English, and tell me he had a solemn duty, to discharge,; that he was impressed with the sinful nature of the traffic in liquor vending; and that, as an ambassa- dor set for the defence of the gospel, he was bound to ex- press such convictions. I opposed his theory, it is true; yet, at that time, I invariably held the man in reverence.  I   THE REIGNING KING.        277' I respected him as a true man, as an honest man, as a righteous maan; and I do believe, by his winning method of addressing his parishioners, that he has impiressed a multitude; for some of his palish are now the most influ- ential leaders in the great temperance reform. Youi see, then, that mealy-mouthed Christians do not secure half so much respect as the plain, reproving ones, who have tihe true interests of their people at heart." "But, Mr. Beals, all have not become converted. like yourself. }-e (that is, some of my brethren) have serious doubts about the matter of property - whether it can be legally thrown, out of the scale. Now you have accumu- lated such immense wealth by tho traffic, ,Mr. Beals, some of your party are struggling to become equally rich by following in your footsteps; and they do not relish being put down by one who has no further need of accumula- tion. How you would have pursued a party, a short time ago, who wilfully interfered with your business! No man would have given a sharper rebuke." ' ' I acknowledge it all, Mr. Grazewell; but because I I should thus have felt myself persecuted, if yoz were really set to arrest an evil, should my pecuniary interests weigh heavier in the scale than the perilled souls of thou- sands? Sir, we must cut off the evil; and it must be done :in high places. I have hitherto always had a de canter or bottle of wine placed upon my dinner table. That single circumstance furnished my son with an argu- 24   UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, ment that he, too, should drink; and how could I plead for his reformation when I, too, was a somewhat inthralled man ? Yes, sir, I resolved to abolish the sight of liquor. It was my habit to drink what is called moderately; but I now see that I ought to renounce the habit; and I have done so, without feeling any loss of strength, or diminu- tion of cheerfulness. Yet I have sad misgivings that I have lived so, incorrigibly in the past, that I merely wish now to say to you, Mr. Grazewell, that, unless you deal more openly with the sin, I must beg to release myself from any longer sitting under your ministry." And so tley separated; but, that evening, Mr. Graze- well held another consultation with his people, and was gratified to find, that, if Uncle Sam's tax- were withheld, there were members remaining who would make good the deficit on his pay roll.

Indeed, he could hardly induce some of his old fiiends to call on him at all. They were once pledged to his choice liquors, not his personal friend- ship; and of what use were such acquaintances ? Yet he had no lack of visitors; but they had an outward look of healthful exhilaration, such as temperance advocates al- ways have, which carries the argument for the doctrine most commonly in the countenance. Gouty men, and hypochondriacs, and old soakers, that delighted to stop at the palace, now shunned it; for the enjoyment of a good dinner has not half the charm that a well-filled decanter affords' to such individuals; yet how Mr. and Mrs. Blair gloried in the change!   The loud laugh which wine often induced, the indelicate language which some, half inebriated, suffered to escape them, were no longer heard, and even Uncle Sam's gouty   280      UNCLE SAIM'S PALACE j OR, affection was far less 'troublesome than it had been for years.    ' But what is the intelligence from our sister state, Ver- mont?  How does our friend Sims regard tde temper- ance law? Let Mrs. Sims answer that question, as they are now paying their respects to Uncle Sam. "When I was last married, Mi'. Beals," says this lady, "I was suiprised to find that my husband felt 'it essential to his comfort,'-as he called it, to every day drink a glass -of brandy and water. 1, sir, revolted at such an idea; for you well know what a temperance advocate your brother, my first husband,.was. Well, he daily drank, until his supply was exhausted. The jugs, one morningi were in our front entry, waiting for the express man to carry them to your city. I -took my husband into the dining room, and begged of him to let the empty deni-i johns be returned to the lockup. I told him of his run- ning counter to public sentiment among us; that he would lose the confidence of our best men, who were pledged to temperance, if he did not follow my prescription; and, to please me, he consented to do as I desired. -A woman, Mr. Beals, is, or can be, tMhe best temperance lecturer in : the world. Mr. Sims, however, complained, a few days, of 'great faintness 'at his stomach.' This alarmed me greatly; for I had ever heard that this indicated a con- firmed habit; and the idea that I should be allied to a- drunkard would have driven me to distraction. The very   THE REIGNING  UING. i     281 shade of my Richard seemed to stand before me, and say, 'Persevere.' I at first quelled the gnawing of a vitiated appetite by nutritious diet, until I at length made him ac- knowledge, that, since he had quit the custom of drinking, ' he had felt more vigorous than he had for years.' Rosa, as you recollect, long ago, cured .Ir. Sims; of smoking; andc as both these habits seem now eradicated, I have only to ask you and Mr. and Mrs. Blair to help me sub- due one other inordinate propensity, which is the love of office seeking.". "Does he still crave an office under government?" in- quired Uncle Sam. "Well, --let him seek it. -He will never receive the offer of one he would deem worthy of acceptance. It will always be a second-rate appointment, at whichwhis dignity will revolt." lir. Sims now entered. "What say you, Mr. Aeals, to my application to our president for a consulship at some foreign port?" "I say it's all nonsense, and not worth the paper you will spot to make the application, Sims. Why, are you der'anged upon this subject still? You are a monomaniac, Sims. Let me never hear you aga/in: speak- upon this t subject." Sims took the hint, and dropped it; but that farm, and his new office, which was appended to the dwelling house since his marriage, held out but little inducement to him to quietly sit down. Indeed, I have sometimes queried; 2I*   282     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, whether a drunkard cannot sooner be induced to yield to argument than an inveterate office seeker." The settle- ment of Uncle. Sam's accounts had' already considerably enriched him, and the old man. was now about securing an; annuity to him, so that he need not complain that it was a matter of necessity to-change his business. And now we will- introduce Rosa and her. Spanish lover, Mr. Mustang. For a considerable period they had kept up a "diary," recording the most trivial events. Indeed, our little coquette had been more minute than was needful, or perhaps -helpful to the security of her prize -for she thought of scarcely any thing but what had a reference to him ; arid her conversation, of course, became quite disagreeable to her acquaintances. Her mistake, however, let me here premise, is no uncom- mon one.  l Do not some people, both pld and young, evince a strong desire to converse almost exclusively upon what- ever may be the subject, of their thoughts? seeming to think that the person who'mi they may have chosen for a companion for life is as much an object of interest to others as to themselves; so that, pursuing this subject un- warrantably, a disgust is engendered, arid the friend is shunned, as having: no conversat'ional powers but what relate to the loved or lover.    , Now, Rosa Beals was one of this class, ":Her divine Mr. Mustang" was a hated household word; and even   THE REIGNtNG' KING.       283 the old Squire no longer regretted that he had been cast aside; for her manifest indifference to him had long ago chilled the ardor of his affection, and he looked upon his wife as a paragon of perfection. The young lady was now preparing for a visit to the palace. Slhe had informed her cousin, that, probably, it would be the last that Rosa Beals would ever pay'her. She then spoke of her lover's devotedness, and his urgent solicitation that their union should not be longer postponed than necessary; yet as she knew nothing of his char- acter, herl mother and step-father protested: against her advancing any further, until some information could be ob- tained. Squire Sims had written again and again to peo- ple resident on the island; yet nothing satisfactory was elicited. That there was such a firum, and that they were:  reputed as doing a fair business, was admitted; but as to the habits and characteristics of the gentleman in ques-t tion, there was a dead silence.  Of late, Mr. Mustang had complained,. in his letters, that his business so engrossed his time, that he must be pardoned for writing incoherently; that he might not be able to come north as soon as he originally promised; and, to a keen observer, there was less of the "ardent attachment" than formerly. Still, Rosa was blind, and did not so 'construe it., One day, a postman handed her a newspaper published on the island whither her thoughts so often tended, and in --       '     St   284     UNCLE -SAM'S PALACE ; on, which she was so deeply interested. She read and re-read it, without observing, as she did afterwards, a slight mark under the following notice, whichi ran thus: "Married, in Oitha, Mr.-- Henry Mustang to Miss Josepha Don Miguel." Rosa was found, soon after, faint, and in a state of uncon- sciousness, holding, With a tiglit grasp, the paper whichl had caused her trepidation. For days after, she was nearly frantic. She raved, and wrote to him her most vehement utterances; " she would never again trust the sex ;" and ended by calling HHeLven to witness that such vile conduct would meet with a fear- ful retribution. And so, indeed, it deserves; yet having ibeen warned, was not her persistence a ground of serious -self-condemnation? I Violent expressions in love, as in grief, yield the soon-6 esti to other influences; and, as. a proof that no deep and -abiding love long remained in Rosa's breast, we next hear of lrer as engaged to the son of a wealthy farmer, who is now a sophomore in college. The breachi seems all healed, which only shows how she. could accommodate her affections to all latitudes and tastes; ;but on one thing,  she seemed fully intent, which was, that she would never exist " withput a beau." ,Mrs. Blair has her now more under her control, and advises with lher upon propriety of conduct; so that, if she keeps on the course she has marked out, she may yet become a useful and domestic woman. Uncle Samn, too, will always look upon her with \ '                   " -.,   THrE ISIGNING DING.       285 peculiar interest; and he rewards his friends with thd "material aid," when necessary. We will' therefore pre- diet a happy close to her waywardness, and a return to the path wherein a woman exercises the best influence- even in making herself a sunbeam in her own home, in which all thlle graces and virtues are conspicuously devel- oped. Let us pause here a moment, and change our pros-, pect. Sitting by the 'window which commands a view of the path that leads: to the railroad, a delicate-looking woman is discerned leading a flaxen-haired boy. The little crea- ture seems unwilling to walk but: the lady gently chides him; and as she picks a flower and gives him, he is con-  tent. to trot along in front of her. Mrs. Blair cannot divine who this stranger may be. - The woman looks pale an ;careworn; but still she ap- pears young, very young. She is not a beggar, surely, unless shei4 made so by another's fault; for there is a sweetness of expression and a countenance which indicate that she belongs to no vulgar train. The door bell is softly rung, and the stranger inquires for Mr. Beals. Mrs. Blair supplies her father's absence; and the lady thus continues her inquiries, as the little boy sits demurely, at her side, much fatigued: - "It may, it must, strike you very strangely, Mrs. Blair,         ,                  .j,   286     UNCLE SAI'S, PALACE; OR,  , as I suppose, you a-le, to be informed that Iam the wafe of your brother 172omas." Mrs. Blair raised her hands and exclaimed, "It cannot be. Thomas was never married. He, would have told me of such an event." ' "'Please deal gently with me," pursued the stranger; "for it would takle but little rough usage to entirely break my throbbing heart." She turned deadly pale, and seemed unable to proceed further. The tender sympathies of Mrs. Blair were at once aroused; and raging with curiosity as she cwas, she yet comforted her guest, and begged lher to postpone her fu- ture account until she could partake:of some refreshment; : and as she looked at that little, tired creattire who sat by her side, there could be no imposition here.- It was stamped with- his father's likeness; and she could not but caress him, feeling he was indeed of her kindred. Mrs. Blair now adverted to the past. A thought - a burning thought, which caused the blood to rush in hot haste to her temples, brought to her recollection that unz- expressed secret which she saw preyed upon her brother's peace when she last talked with him. She left the room a few moments, and asked for divine strength to meetthis unexpected event; then recovering her usual cheerful manner, with an elastic step, she went again into the presence of the stranger, and begged her to tell her all about her business with her father; and, after partaking I  A" 4,   - -  '  -    -      THE REIGNING KING.       287 of -some light refreshment, and becoming a little wonted to the magnificence of the room in which she sat, she thus continued her parrative : - '; When your brother sailed from New York to San Francisco, It, too, was a passenger in the same ship. About two years previous to that period, I was left an orphan, the little property which fell to me by my moth- er's decease being placed in the hands of my step-father, who was an exacting and harsh man. A company of my acquaintances were about to sail for the golden regions, and induced me to go out, alluring me with the prospect of becoming a teacher in music after my arrival.- During the passage, I became acquainted with your brother. When I was sad, he encouraged me; when I was lively, . ....... he often participated in my enjoyment; and before we ended our voyage, we. became warmly attached to each other; so that, in a week after our arrival at San Fran- cisco, zee were married. For a little time, I hoped I had effected a complete reformation in his habits; but a set of miners firom 'the States' made his friendship, and in- duced him to accompany theme to the dry diggings, a great distance off. My heart died within me when Thomas came in, one morning, and informed me he should set off that day in search of treasures. I knew the men were not suitable companions for hin; :for they supplied them- selves most profusely with liquor, to the exclusion of real comforts. I was left alone in a hotel, which, soon after,   288     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, ( changed hands, and early found ,no acconlplishment could be made of much account unless it brought the music of dollars-to the ears of the eager multitude., I was never accustomed to such society; yet, to earn my daily bread, I worked as seamstress, and did odd jobs for those who were weather beaten, and almost without clothing, on some of their return marches. Small lumps of gold were frequently thrown into my lap by noble-hearted men for whom  I had repaired clothing; but I was wretched, as nearly all my party had gone to a settlement some miles above, and left me to feel the desolation of a heart without a home. But I enlisted the sympathy of a family who went from New York; and they kindly took me in, and provided what was needful, that I could not obtain; and I remained with them nearly a year, during which time my little Sammy was born." "And where was Thomas all this long time?" inter-' rupted Mrs. Blair. "Why, madam, I received intelligence, that, on his re-  turn homeward, he was seized with the fever of ithe cli- mate,nd died. I never heard arny thing to the contrary; and when I could procure a passage, I sailed to New York. "Upon my return to that city,' I was welcomed, and made it my home with an old friend. Supposing myself a widow, I struggled with my ad'verse -fate, and solicited the patronage of those who remembered my former -A' " 2 '                THE REIGNING KING.       289 musical attainments; and thus I secured a class which enabled me to support myself comfortably. Judge of my astonishment, my dear Mrs. Blair, when I received the following letter, in your brother's well-known handwrit- ing:-  ' "Mr DEAR- WIFE: I ame now safely returned to my father's; and finding he is a very wealthy man, I do not know why I cannot receive a portion of his riches. When I was' in New York, I sought to find you, but was not able to do so. I wish -much to see my boy ' Sammy, who, I understand, is named after my father. I think we can yet; live together. That was a, vague, unfounded ru- mor about my death, made up by those who robbed me of my bag of gold when I was intoxicated. I must tell you I still drink. I cannot help it. Ned Fleming and Sam, Tony are always lying in wait for me; -and when I take one glass, my appetite demands another. But hang me if I can tell why I should not indulge my appetite as well as other people. The old man sits beside his decanter eviery day at dinner; and wlvhat is good for one is good for all. That's my theory. "If, however, you would come to me, I will try and re- form.  The old man thinks I had better go where the traffic is entirely cut off; and I shall accept his proposal, if he insists upon it.

If the old man would set an example him- self, I would follow it. My sister married a Blair. Ask for her if father isn absent when you arrive. I have never told any body, since my return, of our marriage. So you may explain all. But come to me, and bring the boy, wheniever you can. "Yours truly, - "T. BEALS." ;M-rs. Blair needed no other assurance that no imnposi- tion was being practised upon her. She therefore kindly bade the stranger throw off her outside covering; and little "Sammy" seemed wild with delight in his new quarters. But here was a most unexpected devIelopment, which required much discretion to act 6pon, and disclose to her father and -husband. She conferred with Mrs. Sims, who was at the palace; and they both concluded that there ought to be a reunion between the husband and wife ; and although'it was mortifying to feel that a brother's and sofns confidence had been withheld yet, as matters stood, ;did not expediency point to burying all that was so pain- ful in the past?- Now a new life must be begun.   THE REIGNING KING.        291 Uncle Samn, Ir. Blairh; and Squire Sims llhad just re- turned from the city in high spirits. - Indeed, the old gen- tlenman seemed renovated since his determinations were put in effect; for if he was calumniated in one quarter, he was cheered in another. The wife of Thomas Beals and his little boy were in the dining room when they entered. 3Irs. -Blair 'intro- duced her as "3Irs. Beals, a stranger, who had but just raved.   '  iUncle Sam cast a glance at the stranger, and then play- fully added, "Your name Beals, madam?   If so, I sup- pose you are some of my kin; for all the stock came frpm one place, I suppose."   - j "Yes,'" said Mrs. Blair, "she is very nearly connected . to tts, father. She is our Thomas's wife; he married her in California." The old man threw d6wn his'-hat upon the floor. "' No, Eunice," said lie, "never. Thomas is not such a boy, let him be as he will." But Mrs. Blair could always irradiate the darkest pic- ture; and  she rem-inded her father of her brother's ap- pearing. to leave her writh an undivulged secret. "There- fore," said she, "rather than make   his concealment a wiltul act to blind us, do e not have reason to believe a' ' sense of modesty, and, perhaps,-an inward conviction that 'he had done wrong, prompted him to keep the fact from jus, father?" e  ,   292     UNCLE, SAM'S PALACE; OR, A ray of hope played over-Uncle Sam's countenance at this explanation; and he cast a compassionate look towards the stranger, and bidding, the little, flaxen-haired boy, of sca'rce two summers' growth, come to him, he im- printed a kiss upon his downy-cheek. In a low tone, he then -addressed his daughter; but the words "conclusive  evidence"' were only heard. The stranger blushed deeply, and burst into tears; whereupon Mrs. Blair explained what had transpired; -and, of course, the father received the conclsive evidence beyond doubt. And now here was another emergency which Uncle Sam was called upon to meet. To those outsiders who envied the rich man in, his palace, if but a 'disclosure of the proprietor's feelings, that night, could have been :laid open, who, among the poorest and humblest aspirants for wealth but would have said," 3 ive me my poverty-; give ame my laborious -trade, with ny rugged but healthy chil- dren, in my lowly Cottage; give me my daily wages, and frugal meal, and coarse clothing; yea, give me Yany thing but a dissolute child, and the efects zwhich flow there- front"- This was a bitter draught for Uncle Sam.  There was such a withdrawal of confidence in his son, it stung him to the quick; and he passed a sleepless night in the contemplation. Again: had it not been for the judicious advice of- his   THE REIGNING- KING.       293 daughter and son-in-law, we know'not what earthly re- source would have been left to him; but, withl such treas- ures, his heart was always lightened of its troubles, nlnd he felt the profound security which such an alliance con- ferred; for there is a sure calculation which never fails, when two hearts are regulated by sterling principles. Uncle Sam, therefore, early conferred with his children upon the -course he ought to pursue. Indeed, there could be no vindictive feelings' towards the mild but misguided stranger, who, in a moment of rashness, had connected herself with so unworthy a, com- paiion as that dissipated. young man. Ought she not to be tenderly cared -for, and watclled over, and made com-' fortable, out of such abundance? Besides, she presented no imperious claim. She only asked to be restored to her -husband, and expressed a willingness to aid him in his future course.  Stand aside, O ye of harsh exterior, who would drive from your hearts those who, for one such rash act, are forced, in their extremity, to commit yet others, because no sympathizing .heart beats' in unison when their repentant souls would cheerfully perform any task whereby they migh regain their former self-respect; for such were the feelings of her whose character now attracts our criticism. ,-. It took no very persuasive arguments to induce the old man to yield to the suggestions of lhis advisers, that John, the coachman, should take the large carriage, and they 25 *   294'     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, would accompany the wife to the home of her husband,; thus continuing him  in his unexposed condition, and when- the arrangements were completed which placed in *the wardrobe all necessary articles that would confer com- fort upon the newly-acknowledged, daughter and sistear, they set out on their journey. It was soon discovered that Thomas Beals had married no helpless being; that sshe was well educated, chastened by her struggling anxieties, and desirous of becoming a helper in her husband's emancipation. That little bloy, too, was one of the 'most interesting of his years. He loved every body who gave him a lind glance; and the permission to call Uncle Sam " grandpa"  was almost overwhelming to the sensitive mind of his mother. On the whole, the conclusion seemed to be, that what, at first,' appeared such an untoward circumstance as this marriage, might, after all, but more contribute to the well being of him whom they were about to visit. We   will next look in upon our arrived party at Captain Treadwell's fireside. The interview between the husband and wife, the first sight of the father as he beheld his son, we will not portray. There are meetings over which wev gladly draw the veil of privacy; and this was such a one. After the long and private interview with the reunited pair was terminated, while the overpowering sensations, it occasioned were attested by the marks which a channel of tears had left upon their cheeks, Thomas Beals sought an   THE REIGNING KING.       295-: interview with his sister. "Eunice," said he, "this is overpowering. I did not expect so much from your kind- ness. What did father say when he was told I was mar- ried in California? And have I not a nice wife?, and that boy, too?"  Is it any wonder he was incoherent in his expressions? for his heart was deeply touched. Thie replies of Mrs. Blair were such as accorded with her sympathizing nature. She added, her father only asked if he were willing to be forever pledged to the doc- trine of total abstinence from intoxicating draughts; and we must subjoin his manly reply: - -  Sister," said he, ' I cannot express my feelings. The idea that I am now rescued front the power of tempta- tion.; that I am not likely to be assailed by companions who would decoy me, if possible, to partake again of the- destructive poison; the thought that I am not now the victim of a habit which used to demand a daily gratifica- tion, makes -me feel as I cannot tell, you. Eunice, the teetotaller's emancipation has never been -fairly written out. I intend to do it, m some day. I want to speak of the freedom, the escape, the conscious manliness which attends one who is thus rescued." "But be humble and grateful, Thoinas. Let not your enthusiasm betray you into a vain confidence that you are able to keep yourself. You must everyday repeat the petition that you may be kept fromi temptation, and be able to overcome, if tenzmpted. Remember this, my brother. r  t -   BOD-     UNCLE SA3I'S PALACE ; ORn And now, Thomas, I lhave come- on purpose to provide a home for you, where you can be settled, and become, for a time, a useful citizen; for Captain Treadwell speaks of the important influence, you can now exert in reclaiming others." ' '"And does father still hold on in advocating the law?' 'ifuired Thomas. "Indeed he, does," replied Mrs. Blair; " and never was a man more thoroughly converted to the doctrine of total abstinence;" and she narrated the history of knocking out the bungs at the palace, much to the amusement of her brother. But to look upon the changed aspect of her brother filled the heart of Mis. Blair with a thrill of transport. He was so relieved of that bloated   exterior, of that blotched face, and of those swollen and watery eyes, that she could hardly credit the rapidi progress which a temn- perate habit had induced. And then his nature seemed alike altered with his external appearance; and Captain Treadwell and his family spoke in such flattering terms of his behavior, that she could not but be more and more established in the doctrine of total abstinence, which had produced such a  transformation. And   why should not Thomas Beals be settled in a home of his own? There was General Roby, about to leave this country for Australia; and he was desirous of renting or selling his farm and utensils, together with his "       .         .'   'THE REIGNING KING.       297 furnished dwelling, as his family would board in his ab- sence; and the captain suggested, that Thomas might be: most pleasantly situated where the tempter had lost his foothold. It isl needless to add, that Thomas Beals and his wife felt as if they should be the happiest of mortals, to be thus sittiated; for he could not but love one who had made such heavy sacrifices for him; and as to woman, why, the  soIng says, that, " when she loves, she loves forever." Mr. and Mrs. Blair had no misgivings with respect to their father's approval of any measure they might carry into execution; and, in less than a fortnight, the whole business was arranged, Mrs. Blair remaining, "to put things to rights." She now looked out upon    this happy community. There was no strife; there were no furious competitions, no swaggering demeanor, such as intemperance often en- genders, but an industrious thrift, a cleanliness, and-an air of sobriety which plainly showed the power and potency-" of the law which regulated their movements - all clearly attributable to the presence of temperance as their rule of life.  Upon Mrs. Blaies return, she narrated to her father the pleasing change which was effected in his son. It filled the old man's heart with delight; and he could only exclaim, "If such are the regenerating influences of total abstinence; if such comfort is permitted to descend into {    ,-   298     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR,      A my heart by the contemplation of my son who is thus res- cued, how many-tlousands of hearts may be cheered in life manner! since what has effected the salvation .of one prodigal son- may be applied to scores of others ; and- where all entreaties are vainly zrged, and all our efforts are ineffectual, and we. are led to deplore t]he day that such offspring ever saw the light, then comes in the potency of Law.  The poison is not to be found, and the disease is subdued, and a renewal of life again blesses the parenrtal heart."  We cannot omit the following letter, which was written by Thomas Beals to -his father when Mrs. Blair returned, leaving them eligibly situated in their new home: - DEAR FATHER: I hardly know how I shall find words to express my gratitude to you for your repeated acts of kindness? I 'feel I have been a disobedient son; that I have yielded to a depraved appetite, which nearly de- stroyed all the generous instincts of my nature. But, fa- ther, I have reformed; and I know you will only ask that I should hold out as I have begun. I know I am impul- sive, and used to break all promises of amendment; but it is not so now. :.  My heart goes out to-rescue others. For the delightful home you have furnished me I am truly thankful, and my wife daily blesses you; but I can never tell you the free- dom I feel as a rescued man. I awant to urge you on to   THE REIGNING KING.       299' press the necessity of advocating the total abstinence prin- ciple, as the only saving one. Did I not try every other, and then fall? Reason will not always avail a besotted man. Promises made in good: faith are often broken. Nothing but the removal of the temptation can effect the cure.- Do not dally about a license system. It was that system which gave me as much liquor as I needed; and all law must be inoperative where it works. Father, your influence is great. It used to be in the old ranks. It may be doubly so in the new field you have entered.              e Captain Treadwell and I have chatted a great deal to- i Ogether upon-the appropriation of so much wealth as you possess, being the result of your traffic. When awakened to the sin by which it has been accumulated, ought. not a portion of it to be devoted to relieving from degradation all rwhom we can by the. power such wealth confers? These are questions you would never have supposed me to have asked; but when a man is thoroughly re- formed, he looks at principle, rather than self-interest;, and I should be glad to know that you have devised some way to benefit those who have become total abstinence men. A little encouragement ought to be furnished them by a fund which could be appropriated to give them a start, if they have spent all their substance. I hope, one day, to do something to gladden the hearts of tliose who   300     UNCLE SAM 'S PALACE; OR, have emancipated themselves from the thraldom which intemperance produces.

Uncle, Sam took the above letter to his chamber, and read it- over and over again; and whenever he was re- 'proached, for leaving his old party, he always took out this letter, and inquired "if such a son was not worth the saving." , ,' . - ,   THE REIGNING KING.        301 CHAPTER IX.

DURING Mrs; Blair's absence, 1r. and Mrs. Tis' had been much at the palace. We need not be!surprised,. therefore, to hear that a dissolution of copartnership now took place in the firm of "Tims, Budd, & Co.," and that Mr. and Mrs. Tims are about to make a European voy-, age, as it is hinted, solely at Uncle Sam's expense; for as he now considers himself accessory to his continuing in "the bad business, with heavy profits," he probably feels the desire to remunerate him for the qualms of conscience which he has encountered in consequence; for Mr. Tims believes in the expediency of the workings of the law as much as Uncle Sam, and will never resume his traffic. And now the old gentleman proposes an alteration in his will. The new situation in which he finds himself renders the act obligatory; and out of his abundance, un- doubtedly, his interest in the cause of temperance will lprompt him to give more efficiency to the subject to which he, daily acknowledges his indebtedness for his present comfort; and he means to act upon his son's suggestion. D-26-   ,302     UNCLE SAM'S PALACE; OR, Every week brings the most gratifying intelligence -from Thomas Beals; and when the full force of the law is executed in his native state, lIe will undoubtedly return to it a reformed and useful Citizen. It is pleasant thus to take our leave of the old proprie- - tor of the palace. We call him a personification of pub- lic opinion. Taking the bitter and violent opposition which he first sent forth, that there should be no law, as the sense of the greater part of the community when it was first broached, his half-awakened conscience is that same opinion still fighting against light and evidence, and his final surrender to the awakened community who ard roused to the necessity of a law which involves their domestic peace inits faithful execution. We, too, see the temperance cause depicted in, the character of Mr. Blair; for while he is a full believer in the doctrine of total abstinence, he is so fearful of incur- ring personal ill will, that he does .not resolutely set him- self about calTying forward the great enterprise; and in Mr. Tims we have the enslaved victim who is held -in, the meshes of his despicable traffic, because he is bound to protect his pecuniary interests, which are staked at the mercy of the millionnaire. But this is the past; and may it stand as a fearful bea- con of warning for the future. And, now, when our ears shall be assailed by furious ;antagonistical principles, , that the rights of property   THE REIGNING KING.       303 are hazarded;" and that an innovation, unwise and illegal, has struck a death blow to the traffic -in ardent spirits, wherein thousands are forced to sacrifice their calling, let us still bear up the -ark of our moral safety, and remem- ber that all great evils, to be exterminated, demand a sac- Orifice commensurate with the stupendous weight of the sin; and let us derive an, encouragement, that, if some pecuniary interests are involved in the issue, the degraded- condition of millions who are thus perilled without law is as a sand upon the' sea shore, compared with the mighty heap which surrounds it. Are we not wearied and worn with the degrading pic- tures of intemperance, as we hear of their blighting influ- ences upon the hovels of the poor? Do we not cast out such victims, and satisfy our consciences that we have' provided for them temporary asylums, and then go on, with an appeased conscience, to swell still higher -the cata- logue of poor inebriates? ow let us turn to the palaces of the rich; and tell me how you solve the problem, that he who is sleeping off the fumes of the last nighlt's de- bauch, or reeling under the excesses which he poured down from yonder dinner table, is any the less reprehen- sible or amenable for his conduct, because, forsooth, he lies upon his luxurious bed, which is canopied with gorgeous drapery, than- he who, in the same state of intoxication, lies. upon his. pallet of straw, with an upturned gaze, on, whom the light of heaven falls through the chinks of his             - A      .   Sl4     - UNCLE SAM S PALACE; OR, dilapidated roof. -F We may make distinctions here; but how stands the record above?: We are commanded, by sanitary laws, to clear our premises from all obnoxious substances which may en- danger our health;. but when thus obedient, let us re- move, or hermetically seal over, the deleterious influences which come from that receptacle we call "the wine cel- lar ;'" and if no law is, nor can be, provided which forci- bly ejects those " quarter casks," and " old labelled and cobwebbed bottles,"^'which have sailed round the world, to give to them a "higher zest and gTeater body," let the force of public example so far neutralize suchi influences, that alone, and unseen by human eyes, it may be quaffed by' its rightful' owners, while they shall shrink abashed from public exposure. We must turn with hope to the generation to follow after the inmates of- such Ipalaces; but give to us but a , law which cuts off the supply, and we may soon hope to stop the demand, since only the craving of a perverted appetite is the difficulty which obstructs our path; for God has given us bodies which require no inordinate stim- ulus but such las fieely gushes from every sparkling rivulet that gently trickles beside our daily pathway. And, in a vision of the night, three grim spectres stood before me. One was of boastful exterior; and'he de- tailed his mighty acts upon the battle field. He had slain v    THE FEIGNING KING.   - .    305 his thousands; for he was a victorious chieftain, who had sent desolation into many innocent hearts. He had kin- dled what he called " the fires of patriotism," and, incens- ing his followers to yield to his mandates, the thirst for territory, and the false ambition that sacrifices the masses for the glory of the few, had achieved the object for which he thirsted; and he pointed me to his trophies. There were fields red with blood, over which the grass of centu- ries had now grown; and beneath that soil were buried victims by scores, who fell in one fatal encounter with the enemy; and there were yet other more painful sights, in- asmuch as, after the reign of what we call " the Christian i dispensation,"^the same spectre still held his undisputed sway. He had only to appeal to his false standard of honor, to his instinctive love of country, and make others feel that bullets were but playthings, which would cover the victor's head with a garland of glory, and his potent decree to fight was still obeyed. And then he pointed me to our national pride, our high monuments, our admired paintings, in which artists had embodied their most con- summate skill to portray the sickening and revolting, spec- tacles anew; and " these," said he, " these are the boast of -my advocates. I have truly earned the name of ' Con- queror;' for my love of dominion and power has subju- gated mighty empires; and I am still waiting to Jarouse other fires, and victims, by thousands, shall fall under my 26*   ,306 .   USNCLE SAMS PALACE; OR, imperial reign." He .wore a helmet, and upon its front was inscribed, in legible letters, "WAR." A few paces behind this hideous fiend'stood yet an- other spectre. The philanthropist had -long since dipped his pen, to write an inscription upon his tombstone; but he lingered on, acknowledged by the historian as the great blot upon our national freedom; and even the noble- hearted planter conceded he was an "entailed curse," which he could not cast out, because his pecuniary re- sources would be thus withdrawn, and the: master and slave would be alike beggared; for his soil ,was worn and unproductive; yet he could market its present toiling gangs, and with the proceeds he could still maintain his princely proprietorship, and fatten upon this commodity. The low-crouching child -of misery looked vainly in his face, and entreated him to desist from sending him -to a foreign or distant. market. The woman who clung to what she called her husband, in distracted agony, begged thfat no separation might come upon them; and as she clutched her blue-eyed, laughing infant, she tremblingly inquired, "Why, O, why is he not mine own i " But the planter looked out upon his cotton fields; the trader urged ]iis claim ; the sum which parted them was compromised; "the chattels" were chained, and driven to another terri- tory, ignorant of whose lash they should become the prey, but certain that all they had once called "mine and thine " 'was henceforth to be forever cruelly separated. And the -  r'   THEE REIGNING SING.      307 spectre saw the big tear of resentment, andi he heard the warning expostulation, and -yet stood before me with' his seared humanity, but with the lineaments and figure of a man-; and upon his crest was written, in golden characters, "SLAYERY.". And yet another, more destructive, and, if possible, more hideous and revolting, rose to my view. "I," said he, with a vaunted ail;, "I am the great destroyer. The other spectres may boast of having slain and carried ter- ror and dismay to the hearts of thousands, but I have slain my tens of thousands. In yonder palace, in the distant cottage, in the marts of commerce, in the home of industry, in the saloon of fashion, in the mighty places where talent and genius do congregate, on the bench of justice, and amidst the cry of the populace, I inthrall my victims. I resist the widow's tear, the orphan's wail, the I great cry of humanity, which seeks redress for cruel op- ; pression. Isit at the board of the sumptuous entertain- ment. I ride triumphant in yonder gilded chariot. t tread my heel, with crushing effect, upon the home of in- nocent mirth, and cause infancy and age, to be down-trod- den by my potent spell. I laugh at oppression, sneer at the cry of 'humanity, ride rampant upon the necks'.of subjugated millions, and in all lands, and in all ages, my power is acknowledged as the ' mighty conqueror, the universal bondman, the triumphant king.' I am IINTEM- PERANCE."  4 .           ,   308      TUCLE SAM'S PALACE. And a sweet, enchanting nvmlh, by her magic spell, sought to drive out this furioui monster. He stood abashed at her presence, and seemed awe-stricken by her lovely exterior. She brandished no vindictive sword that slew her captives. She only uttered melodious sentences; and, by her magic wand, she caused a new Eden to ap- pear; and the old serpent had no place in her garden of delights; for she sang a song of joyous melody, and the chorus rang loudly, so that all under the canopy of the new paradise caught the sound, "THE LAW HAS TRI- UMPHED; THE REIGNING KING IS DETHRONED'"
