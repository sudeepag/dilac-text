CHAPTER       I. INTRODUCTORY. IF thou seest, the oppression of the poor, and violent per- verting of judgment -and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for He that is higher than the highest regardeth; and there be higher than they." THE   Talbot Bank has failed, and Bessie Wilmerton is to be a governess. This was the substance of a letter I received  from  home in the early spring of the  year I85-, during a short absence in a neighboring  city. The  two  circumstances were thus mentioned in connection, from   the fact of their bearing a near relation to each-    8- INTRODUCTORY. other. By the failure of the Talbot Bank, 'Mr. Wilmerton lost more than three-fourths of a handsome fortune, and Bessie, the eld- est of five children, and the only one whose school-education was completed, decided; un- selfishy and promptly, to relieve her father of her own and hen sister's support, by be- coming a governess. -There was little- more than this; information in theletter, which had been hurriedly penned, except an urgent en-, treaty for my immediate return. Now, Bessie Wilmerton and I had been the truest of friends ever since that early period when the present of a new doll had added fresh interest to our holidays, and my first im- pulse was to go to -her at once. An unfort- unate state of. things about me, however, precluded this. Chafe against circumstances as I might, and did, they were utterly beyond my control. Desire: must be foregone, Will subdued, and the virtue Patience taken wholly to heart, ere the hour of my departure could arrive, for return was impossible before the -next week.                 ' At length, when the intervening miles of '  . .   INTROD UC TOR Y. separation had been traversed, and Bessie was again within the reach of a hand-clasp and caress, I found myself altogether unprepared for the change in her surroundings. Mr. Wil- mertoan had disposed of his elegant mansion in Elliot Place, and the family now occupied second-rate lodgings in a back street. The alteration in their prospects, which I had before in. vain attempted to realize, struck and chilled me, and I could for a time only listen, in silence to an explanation of causes, the effects of which were but too apparent in everything around me., Bessie herself could not forbear smiling at the serious manner and very tragic face with which I listened to her, as. she dwelt upon her parents' plans, and the novel tasks the coming months held for herself. "Why, Marie," she ,said, " in the book we last read together, Baron Wessenberg says, ' (La vie la plus occupge sera la 'oins malheu- reuse,' and we both agreed at the time to the assertion. Shall we dispute it' now?" Her manner and cheerful words consoled me, and I took shame to myself that I was more depressed than my friend, 'who 'needed '  '     no  t;  - . INTROD UCTOR Y. surely something beside an inactive sympathy on my part; and I endeavored to contemplate t her future, with that fortitude which she seemed herself to possess in such full measure, although the aspect of things looked uninvit- ing and barren to a degree. Mr. Wilmerton, upon ascdertaining the ex- tent of his loss, had decided on removing with his wife, and their three sons, to a tract of land which he possessed in Minnesota, and rapid preparations were being made for the journey. Bessie had already accepted a situa- tion as governess, which had been offered her in the family of a Mr. Forrester, as soon as Iher intention to teach had become public.. Kate, her only sister, now about sixteen, was to remain at Madame Merillat's, the vicinity of whose boarding-school to Mr. Forrester's town residence would allow of an easy inter- course between the sisters, during the season Mr. Forrester's family remained in the city. Surprised as I was, at the rapidity and   X energy with which every arrangement had been made, I failed not to admire the self- sustaining cheerfulness apparent in every   INTR OD UCTOR Y.     I member  of Mr. Wilmerton's  household. Great as was the change in their lot, and sudden and severe as was the effort required from each and all, none were found over- whelmed or desponding. Mr. Wilmerton, fond of a scholar's pursuits, and possessed, of an exceedingly polished exterior, was a-great favorite among his friends, and a man not dis- . posed to weigh indifferently the pleasures and benefits arising from high .social position and cultivated society. Yet he proposed to begin life anew, on his uncultivated farm in the Westi well aware of the difficulties he was sure to meet, but endued with so strong a spirit of self-reliance and, industry, that he looked forward cheerfully to toil and depriva- tion, satisfied if, by personal endeavor and unremitting exertion,- he could ensure to his boys the advantages of a college course. For this purpose, he laid aside all that could {be? spared from his scanty funds, and purposed, after some preparation, which he was well fitted to give them, to send his sons to that beloved Alma Mater where he himself had graduated.   12     INArTROD UCTOR Y. His friends heard with astonishment his de- termination to forsake the East. They could not fancy him obliged by the :urgent necessi-  ties of his case, to labor with his hands, in a  wild and hostile region, inhabited almost wholly by coarse demi-savages, and they crowded about him with various offers, all of which, meant kindly to detain him, he declined  firmly, and at once. " ' The mind-is its own place,'; he said; and again, when closely  * pressed by some to whom long years of intin- acy gave a right to remonstrate, he replied : "I believe with Goethe, that ( Man's highest merit always is, to rule external circumstances, and as little as possible to let himself be ruled by them.' Urge me no more to be what'you yourselves would despise-a weakling, swayed by my fortunes into acceptance of your aid. I trust yet to be able to wrest content, if not happiness, from the hands of an adverse Fate." .  Mrs. Wilmerton had some difficulty in per- suading her husband to allow her to accom- pany him at once to the West; for it had been his first intention to proceed with his  -        , K   IN-TRODUCTORY.      3 13  sons to their destination, and provide at least a shelter for her, who was to share their exile. He could not endure the thought of the hard- ships his accomplished and delicate wife Would have to undergo; but with great good sense she insisted upon the journey's being made at once and together. What her husband and sons could endure, she would not shrink from ; and she entered with alacrity and spirit into all the arrangements making for their departure. By an economical forethought and care, she so provided that their Western home should not be without a few comforts to which her hus- band and children were accustomed, and the absence of which, she knew, would contribute not a little to dishearten all, in the wilderness in which they were to live. For the luxuries, the privileges, the dear and tried friends .she was leaving behind, she dropped perhaps a few natural tears, but in' no repining spirit. 'A bitter, unspoken sorrow, too deep to be wept for, too enduring and unavoidable to be murmured at, by a woman' of her tempera- ment, filled her heart at the thought of leav- ing Bessie and Kate, and two other beloved   1 I4     INTRODUCTORY. children, laid away in the death-rest, whose graves she was now no more to tend. But this was grief to be dwelt upon only in her lonely moments, when no other eye could be troubled by an expression of sadness in her own. A "helpmeet indeed she proved to her hus- band, ready and willing to make any sacrifice for. his sake, or their children's welfare. It is true, her resolve to accompany Mr. Wilmer- ton to the far West, a region which her imag- ination filled with innumerable dangers and privations; made as' it was at the expense of ,great self-denial and untold fears, gave her  many secret misgivings; but she never once - thought of entreating him, as a weaker woman would have done, to remain in their native city, and live upon the- scanty remn'ant of their fortune. She was indeed a woman of a thou- sand, in an age when -too many wives and mothers are treated and act like spoiled chil-  dren. There are few city-bred women who would c6nsent to take the part Mrs. Wil- merton cheerfully accepted; few who would not shrink in dismay from the prospect of hardship and toil, leaving to their husbands, ,   INTROD UCTORY.      15 and too often to their children also, " the heat and burden of the day." It were but natural to expect in the daughter-, of such a mother, resigned and noble conduct under -misfortune; but there were circum- stances in Bessie Wilmerton's lot that filled me with a peculiar sorrow, to which, however, I might-give no-utterance, for their nature was such as to prevent even an expression of sym- pathy on my part. With a calm mien of will- ing acceptance, she went forth -to receive from the hands of the inexorable Lachesis the tasks she held for her. I beheld her with no ordi- nary emotion, knowing as I did that her father's loss of fortune was but a secondary and light affliction, in comparison with one which, but a short time before, "had darkened and closed round her life like a pall. The bark of her earthly happiness was afloat "On a wide, wide sea," its anchor gone, its sails torn and useless, and she herself a sane and calm spectator of the wreck, around which the spirits of the. Past wailed a moaning dirge. RU *i' '  b v    -I 6.  SINTRODUCTORY. Betrothed from earliest childhood to Law- rence Esterlyn, the son of an old and valued friend of her father, long deceased, Bessie Wilmerton had never known what it was to lack the love of a generous, chivalrous, aind devoted heart. -But two 'years her senior, Lawrence, who was pursuing his studies at a ' i :university in his native city, directed her pur- suits, and. in a measure influenced her tastes and habits; for save the 'hours spent with his class,. he was seldom absent from her side.. I have said in a measure. On the subject of i religion alone, did Bessie find Lawrence re- served and far too silent, she judged; yet she hoped that when he connected himself with the church at which he was a regular attend- ant, that she, might speak freely to him of matters that were now never touched by either. A secret, unconfessed uneasiness, en- e tertained by Bessie on this account, disturbed frequently the perfect understanding between ^ the' two. Otherwise their communion was such as is seldom enjoyed on earth. Their marriage was put off to an indefinite period, Lawrence not yet having completed a course   INTRODUCTORY.      . 17 of study he had. marked out for himself, and. ' his mother and Bessie's parents being well satisfied to have it delayed for a season. I cannot well describe the feeling with which 'Bessie regarded Lawrence. To him, she was what woman ever is to man, but one of the many objects of, interest with which his life is filled ; very near, and very dear, it is true, but incapable of occupying his mind and heart  completely, and for all time'. But to Bessie's-  woman heart, he was all in all; her hope, her ambition, her world. Losing him, life ! would be to her henceforth without its greatest charm and highest good, and earth be but a bleak, sunless spot, made only endurable by a faith leading to heaven. A short time before the failure of the Talbot Bank, the publication of a pamphlet entitled "Christ Rejected," drew the attention of the reading public to the University of M  , since one of its students, was said to be its author. All that at different periods had ever been set forth of evil against our blessed religion, was here condensed, and the whole treatise, ,^8                 * ,..    INTRODUCTORY. ably written and plausible- from the force of skilfully advanced arguments, bore weight of no slight power against Christianity; the con- sequences of which, from our Saviour's time, were considered in a one-sided manner, and contrasted with the effects of the doctrines of the heathen philosophers in a way well calcu- lated to mislead youth, possessing as its author did the charm of a chaste and elegant diction, added to the force of allusions to gifted authors of ancient and modern erudition. To describe the surprise of the community and his friends, and the shocked astonishment and grief of Bessie, when it was discovered that Lawrence Esterlyn was the author of this production, is beyond the efforts of my pen. The Faculty of the University summoned him to appear on a certain day for examination, and his friends wrote or appealed personally to him from all quarters. Bessie alone did nothing. In'active, stunned as it were from the suddenness of the blow, her mind for a time seemed unable to rally its forces ; seemed incapable of any exertion, save to entreat that her father would take no steps in the matter--   INTRODUCTOR Y.   19   would seek no explanation. It was days be- fore she was able to reflect calmly upon the sub- ject, and Lawrence Esterlyn, returned after a week's absence from the city, was announced as awaiting her presence below-stairs, before she had determined upon her course of action. Poor young worshipper! Her idol was a god, and infallible no longer. It was not strange that reason refused her aid, and that, be- wildered, in an agony of mind. and heart, she refused utterly to see him. No message--for he made the servant return to her repeatedly- availed to alter her determination, and the last note she received from him, was stained with tears--man's tears, while her own blotted the page as she read: "See me, Bessie, dearest Bessie., as you would do me no wrong. Let me explain, for I can explain all. "My mother is ill--dying, they tell me. I must go to her at once. "Bessie, by our past I conjure you to see me now; 'you must see me; how can you re- fuse? , LARRY."  INTR OD UC TOR Y. But her refusal again reached him, and he was gone, leaving her to nights of wretched- ness and days of suffering, it has been the lot of few to experience and sanely to survive. Ten days after the appearance of the pam- phlet which had so startled the reading world of M  , another by the same author was pub- lished, bearing the Latin title " Yesus Clristus," and containing ,in a preface the statement that it had been the author's original intention to publish the two pamphlets together; but, during his, own absence from the city, owing to a mistake of the printer, an unavoidable delay of the latter occurred. And now again the friends of Lawrence Esterlyn were roused and interested; but this time by no scepticism which shocked and at the same time puzzled and grieved all who had his welfare at heart. "Jesus Christus " was an able and thorough vindication of our Christian belief. Each plau- sible assertion advanced against our religion in the former pamphlet, was considered sepa- rately, and incontestably refuted. The essay finally ended in a powerful argument, proving w            from the, principles of human nature and the history of mankind, that it was impossible to banish religion from the world, and that if the religion of Christ were rejected, no other equally desirable could be substituted in its place. It had been Lawrence Esterlyn's intention to do a right thing, and his ambition to achieve' a brilliant success. By reasoning pro and con. on the subject of Christianity, he had hoped at least to obtain credit for research, and some comprehension of his theme. Whether he did a wise thing, admits of a doubt; but his tri- umph was unquestioned. After the publica- tion of the second pamphlet, the Faculty of the University excused his attendance at the meeting they had appointed, but sent him a letter of expostulation and advice. They blamed him for what they were pleased to call an error of judgment in the publication of the pamphlet entitled "Christ Rejected," but ended by giving him full and hearty praise for his last published erudite and finished pro- duction. And Bessie, now under the influence of a     INTRODUCTORY.  revulsion off feeling as great as it was joyful, wrote impulsively to Lawrence, deprecating her own hasty judgment, entreating his for- giveness, and saying in a few proud happy words how mnore than blest she was. Her note was returned to her, superscribed in Lawrence Esterlyn's mother's handwriting, unopened.  Two weeks, a month, passed away. Lawrence Esterlyn's mother died and was buried. He was again in town pursuing his studies, but Bessie neither saw nor heard from him. The blackness of a'great darkness gathered and fell. From the anguished retire- ment of her chamber, Bessie came forth for life's duties-henceforth its pleasures were not for her. Two months subsequent to the failure of the Talbot Bank, Mr. and Mrs. Wilmerton and their three sons were journeying toward their Western home; Kate was quietly pursu- ing her studies at Madame Merillat's, and Bessie was domesticated in Mr. Forrester's family as governess. This interval, so dili- gently and worthily employed by my friends -,   INTRODUCTORY.   !   23 in preparations for their now wholly changed, -and in a degree toilsome lives, was to me a period of anxiety and some pain. I had made up my mind to the necessity that compelled Bessie to employ her talents in teaching, and had forced myself to contem- plate with calmness the loss of her dear com- panionship, for our hours of daily intercourse were now at an end; but I could not recon-  cile myself to her residence with Mr. Forrester, who was a brother of the cashier of the Tal- bot Bank, and also cashier of the wealthy and prosperous Rossitur Bank, in the same city. Had any one questioned me as to the cause of this dissatisfaction at the time it first began to strengthen in my mind, I could have given in reply no, answer that would not have sub- jected me to the charge of defamation of char- acter; and yet as the days lengthened into weeks, and the weeks into months, my half- hesitating dislike of appearances grew into de- termination, and doubts secretly entertained became certainties. A select committee was appointed to examine the affairs of the Talbot Bank, and as the examination progressed, no    24.     ISNTROD UC TOR Y. question was made by the greater part of the community (by whom an unfair appropriation of the funds was suspected) as to the guilt of the ' parties implicated. Mr. Erastus Forrester, cashier of the Talbot Bank, Mr. Durand Att- wood, one of its directors, and Mr. Stephen Forrester, cashier of the Rossitur Bank, were the principal and most criminal parties in the spoliation. As, a matter of course, there were subordinates connected with the bank, who filled their pursesquietly when they saw others pocketing thousands, secure in the prospect of escape if their superiors in office were not condemned; but the odium of the disgraceful transaction attached itself to the three gentle- men who had been trusted by their unsuspect- ing fellow-citizens, and held to be honest, honorable, accountable; and just. Said one of the most ably-edited papers of the day : "We' understand that the Report of the Examiners of the Talbot Bank will be ready to publish this week. It shall be given to our readers at the earliest moment. Further, we understand that the facts elicited by the exam- ination disclose a shameful spoliation, and    INTR OUCTOR Y.      25 there is not a doubt a "to who have possessed themselves of the funds-of stockholders and depositors." A few extracts from the Report Will make it evident that any dissatisfaction with Mr. Forrester was not without ample grounds, either as regarded his own conduct, or that ' of his brother and friends. In the statement the Committee say: "'The Talbot .Bank transacted business until'  Tuesday," March i3th, two o'clock. - It is proved -that it had long been bankrupt, by the fact that for some time it settled the daily balances with other banks by using the money of depositors, instead of employing the-usual mode, namely, drafts on New York." "The cause of the failure of the bank was the clandestine appropriation of its funds by Mr. Forrester, the cashier, -to his own and his brother's uses. This could not have been done, had not the directors of the bank, with the exception of Mr. Attwood, to whom large loans were illegally made by the cashier, been deceived by false entries and false oaths : they were culpable in placing an unbounded confi-    INTRODUCTORY. dence in the cashier, who well knew how to evade an examination of the affairs of the bank."  "In October, the Rossitur Bank commenced re-discounting paper for the Talbot Bank. The Talbot Bank owed the Rossitur Bank. nothing at the time of its failure. These trans- actions were conducted by the financial officers of the Talbot and Rossitur Banks (Mr. Eras- tus and Mr. Stephen Forrester). The exist- ence (only in name) of the Talbot tank was lengthened, by these re-discounts, for a short time."  An editor of a paper in a neighboring city wound up an article upon the Report of the Committee on the Talbot Bank, from which the above is extracted, by the following paragraph: ( We are indebted to the cashier of the Tal- bot Bank for the discovery of a novel mode of financiering. Witlhno thought of guarding the funds of its creditors, Mr. Forrester ap- pears to have carried on the bank, for a length of time, when insolvent, causing it daily to consume the means entrusted to its care, re- sorting finally to a re-discount of its paper and   I   4   a forced circulation of its bills. Money ille- gally taken was never restored, and the cashier and some of his clerks were defaulters to a large amount, while the over-drafts consisted of a sum equal fully to one-third of the capital of the bank." What need of adding, to the proof? Mr. Stephen Forrester, though not as directly im- plicated in the fraud as his brother, the cashier of the Talbot Bank, was still an active partici- pant in the scheme of dishonorable appropri- ation of the funds of the bank. God forbid that I should do any man wrong! It was only too stern a fact, that Bessie Wilmerton was re- siding under the roof of the man who had aided to despoil her father of his fortune. Did the escape of the offenders from justice, by reason of the active efforts of well-feed law- yers, and the all-potent influence of wealth, make their iniquity less glaring, and reinstate them in their former positidn in society? Apparently it did.  The "jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that honor feels." So- ciety is an humble worshipper of Mammon; its Pariah is seldom he whose intentions are   28    EINTRODUCTORY.  evil, whose life is one long account of wrong  deeds in the sight of a watching, but invisible Judge. Its outcasts are the poor. So the wrong cause triumphed. Were ttlemen vic- torious, or their wealth? The'warrior at the end of a battle gives rare praise, to his good -sword; let us not-deny to the' means here ' used its full Value. And so, cognizant of these facts, I deter- g mined to do my utmost to prevent Bessie's  residence under the roof of Mr. Forrester-this man who made vas't wealth out of the labor .} and savings, of-the many. The matter was a  j difficult one to bring-about, but I had set my j heart on Succeeding, and no ordinary obstacle I would have deterred me-from the attempt, so . sure was .1 that- my gentle, gifted, and culti- j vated friend would be misplaced in Mr. For-  rester's family. I need not recount in this i the various efforts I made, vainly, to accom- plish my object. Suffice 'it, that at length I succeeded in persuading Mr. Peyton, a valued friend of my father's, that his little grand- daughter Lucy was in need of a governess, and then I told him my story.    INTROD UCTORY.      29 I But, Marie," he said, when I had finished, "I cannot offer Mi'ss Wilmerton the salary she will receive from Mr. Forrester, although I  would gladly do so did my means permit." This was discouraging, but surely, I thought, Bessie would prefer to economize, in order to live among congenial friends ; and I coaxed the dear old man to write her a letter, which I car- ried ,to her myself. But I met with the greatest obstacle in Bes- sie herself. She thanked- Mr. Peyton in writ- - ten words; she thanked me with tearful eyes and a kiss, but refused utterly to break her en- gagement with Mr. Forrester. "It was bind- ing on her to keep it," she said, " and come, what would, she could not act dishonorably." "A sufficiently plausible excuse could be given Mr. Forrester," ;I urged, but she was steadfast. I referred to the charges brought against Mr. Forrester; to his character, which not one of the daily papers had -spared; I argued, en- treated, and even went so far as to ground my * appeal on selfish considerations. "Consider, Bessie," I said, '"you are sprung from an educated. race; you inherit, from a ^^^^^^   *^^^^   ,^^----IL   30-     INTR OD UCTOR Y. long line of noble and good 'ancestors, tastes and feelings entirely at variance with those of the class who are likely to be congenial friends of Mr. Forrester; and believe me, the annoyances caused by daily recurring- trifles, to one of your temperament and culti- vation, will, amount, in the end, to quite a sum of vexation. One of your blood, a descend- ant, of-"  "Hush! pray, hush!" interrupted Bessie, "what an -aristocrat'you would make me out. Conceive your father's amazement, did he hear such an anti-republican' speech from your -lips." "The fact of our living in a republic," I re- plied warmly, "need not take away from the satisfaction, legitimate and consoling, which must fill the mind of that person who can trace his lineage to honorable, gifted, and good an- cestors, who, iying, were honored among men, and dead, were truly mourned and long re- membered. B it to the point of all this-" ,Bessie's hand was on my lips. "No more," she said, "I I can hear no more. Painful as my situation will be on many ac-   INTRODUCTORY.     . 31 counts, you but add to the apprehension with wlhich I already look to the future. My reso- lution is unchangeable, because I deem it to be right. God aid me to do my duty; and Marie, meddle no more with what you can neither alter nor amend."' Her tone was that of slight reproof. I de- served'it, for I had exceeded the bounds of prudence : nevertheless I felt it keenly. "Had I not," I said bitterly to myself, " iher welfare at heart?"But my silence on the subject was lasting henceforth. After a time when the keenness of my disappointment was endured and'overcome, I sought legitimate consolation, and found it. Beside preserving Bessie's con- duct from any imputation of dishonorable deal- ing, her refusal of Mr. Peyton's offer secured to her, sister many advantages, which, had it been accepted, Kate would have been obliged to forego, and which now Mr. Forrester's lib- eral salary to Bessie placed in her power. The day came on which Bessie was to enter upon her duties in Mr. Forrester's family, and we drove together to Glen-Beck, his summer   l                    e 32    e  r INTR ODUCTORY. residence, the distance of three or 'four miles from the city of M  . At our parting, we cried heartily in each other's arms, but antici- pated meeting soon again ; for one day in each week was at Bessie's entire disposal. -We did not see each other again for a space of nearly two years. Unexpected circumstances compelled my residence at the So uth, and a visit to the North was rendered impossible during all that tifme.- I heard only of Bessie's welfare from friends, for I could gain little in- telligence of her own health, her sorrows, or -joys fro-m her letters, which were vastly enter- taining and piquant on the topics of the day, and my own affairs, but utterly devoid of even a hint concerning herself, in the circumstances attendant' on her life as governess. At the end of this period came a package and the fol- lowing explanatory note from Bessie : "MY BELOVED MARIE --In the MS. which accompanies this, you will find a history of the past months-my governess life.

" When the heart-sick earth  Turns her broad back upon the gaudy sun, And stoops her weary forehead to-the night, To struggle with her sorrow all alone, The-moon-that patient sufferer-pale with pain, Presses her cold lips on her sister's brow 'Till she is calm.. But in HER sorrow's night SHE found no comforter." ALEXANDER SMITH.  IT was the evening of the day of my arrival at Glen-Beck. You will remember, Marie, that I was wholly unacquainted with Mr. Forrester, whose offer to me of the situation of governess in his family, and my acceptance of it, had been -arranged by letters of application and acceptance. It was not to be wondered at,   36   NE W FACES-BITTERNESS. then, that I looked forward with some trepida- tion to an advent into a circle of entire stran- gers. But my satisfaction may be imagined, when, on entering the drawing-room at Glen- Beck, a young lady came eagerly to meet me, in whom I recognized Mildred, Mr. Forrester's eldest daughter; " our Milly" of a long ago boarding-school memory. She had been one of my companions the year I was separated from you, Marie, and sent to the Medville Academy. I encountered her gladly, and her charming face beamed with a hearty welcome very delightful to me. 'When she }presented me to her parents and brother in tirn, I'was received with the warmth of manner with which one greets an honored and valued friend. At once I was at home; doubts and misgivings had vanished, all chill was gone. Miss For- rester's bright smile and affectionate greeting effectually altered the aspect of things, and the future was not altogether without a charm. When dinner was over, the family, with the exception of Mildred, were assembled in the drawing-room. A chilly and continuous rain had fallen during the latter part of the after- "*sI ,- .Il " ' "   NE W FA4 CZS-BITTERNRESS    37 noon, and a fire was kindled as the twilight deepened, attracting the different members of the :household more or less within the influ- ence of its cheerful warmth. Mr. Forrester : stood with his back to the fire, talking to three children, two boys of the respective ages of eleven and thirteen, and a little girl of -nine. I was too far removed -to hear anything they were saying, for they spoke in low tones, b1ut frommoccasional glances directed towards me, I suspected that I formed, for a time, a topic of interest and inquiry.' Presently the little girl, whom I remembered to have heard her mother call Lillian, came towards me. -She seemed to possess none of that diffidence chil- dren usually exhibit with strangers, for she addressed me directly. "Miss Wilmerton," she said, "papa says you are to be our governess, and hear all our lessons. Are you?."  "Yes, Lillian," I replied, " for that I think your name is, is it not?" "Yes, ma'am.   Lillian Marchison For- rester. Tommy says it is such a funny name, but I like it."   3 8,  - NEw  FA CES-BITTERNESS. She was standing at my knee, looking up into my face with the greatest interest. For a few minutes longer I underwent a silent scrutiny; then heaving a little sigh of relief, she said  , You do not look as if you would be. cross, Miss- Wilmerton. Do you ever speak quick?" "SI am not sure,d I returned, smiling at the naive question. "Shail you not like me to speak quickly?" "Oh, no!" she answered. "It quitertakes my breath away, when I try to spell, and Mrs. Marchmont look   s cross and speaks fast. Tommy, don't!"     D  The boy she called Tommy had been pulling at her dress for some time. I looked at him. He seemed cross and rude and altogether un- like his sister Lillian, who was a gentle, fair child, with soft golden curls, and large eyes of an uncommon and deep blue. Ere long the other boy, who greatly resem- bled Lillian, approached, and looking shyly at me, said to his sister:        , : "Come, Lillian, we cannot do without you.   NEW EFACES-BITTERNESS.    39 We want you to keep 'count' while we play at Tivoli."    ,      ' "I can't, Frank!" said Lillian, who was ex- amining a ring on my finger. "I want to stay with Miss Wilmerton." 1Oh  do  come!" urged Frank, while Tommy continued to pull at her dress. Looking with interest  nd some anxiety at . the trio who were to be ny pupils, I mentally measured my ability to benefit essentially these little strangers, who were to be my charge for, it might be, an indefinite number of years. Addressing a few words to each, I found Tommy rather uncultivated, Frank timid, and Lillian alone conversable; and soon dismissed them to their play, thinking that a few hours spent in the school-room, would give me a clearer insight into the char- acter and disposition of each. Taking a book from  a table near, in order to have the pretext of employment; I took a survey first of the room, and then of its occu- pants. The apartment was richly decorated, and French windows opened upon a piazza, which extended across one side of the house. s   NEW FACES-BITTERNE SS.  The furniture was in the style of the day, richly carved in leaves and flowers. Some valuable pictures were hung in fine lights, and books and engravings ins endless profusion  strewed the tables. Two or three exquisite statuettes wer4 placed here and there, and I  had noticed in the entrance-hall two finely sculptured statues, filling niches on each side of the threshold. Evidently a rare and culti- vated taste had been at work in the adornment of the mansion.  Whose had been the taste and skill ? Mr. Forrester's antecedents were,' I knew, of a nature not likely to produce a result like this. Setting aside the disadvantages of his birth, of a childhood ;ill-cared for and passed  in a Southern State, where school advantages are not common, he. was a man whose thoughts | and time were too closely given to the accu- mulation of dollars and cents, to admit of much self-education, even had it been his wish to cultivate himself. Then, all this exhibition of taste and artistic skill owed not its existence to him, although he might be conscious of a natural, dim  comprehension and pleasure,     when surrounded by it. I examined him as he sat near the fire, reading the evening's paper. There was a lack of refinement about his whole appearance. The expression of his face, low- browed, sleek, and smiling often, did not strike me favorably, and his mouth, wide, with thin lips, was indicative, at times, of dogged determination, He was a tall man, very thin and ungainly, with peculiar and light hair and eyes. I never looked at him with pleasure, and .he seldom willingly encountered my gaze. We were secretly antagonistic from the begin- ning. As we grew to know each other better, we contented ourselves with a talcit avoidance, which became habit in time. From him, I turned to observe Mrs. Forres- ter. She was large in person, and comely, and had been a beauty in her day. Mildred and Lillian resembled their mother greatly, but there was little likelihood of their ever rival- ling her in size. As I judged her then, I found her, a coarse, ostentatious woman, in love with worldly glitter and fashion, with little principle, save what was required by the conventional code of the society in which she   42  \ NE W FA CES--BITTERNESS. moved, and of which she was proud to be a gaudy member. Like her husband& she had in youth received few educational advantages. Possessed, however, of good gifts, under more favorable circumstances, and with a better moral training, she would have made a supe- rior character. One looked at her with a kind of sorrow, for the efforts of a misdirected but. energetic mind gave frequent token of what ,shel might have become., But she, thoughl gifted with some skill in personal adornment, was yet deficient in that fine taste which had selected the belongings of her luxurious home. The only'other occupant of the room was a young man of about five-and-twenty. I had observed the name, P. Walworth Forrester, in gilt letters, upon several volumes in Ger- ' man, of Goethe and Schiller, and concluded that he whom Mil-dred had named to me as "brother," was the owner of the works. Perceiving him to be closely engaged in an examination of the Raphael Cartoons, I had not looked at him with any attention, until he closed the case, suddenly, glancing with a look of annoyance at his mother, who was giving   NEW FA CES--BITTERNESS.   ^ 43 some rather audible directions to a servant. Rising, he stood with, folded arms at a side window, from which he had removed the cur- tain, and looked out upon the night. His profile was fine and grand, for features and brow were Athenian, and perfect almost to severity. He had inherited the color of his mother's hair and eyes, but the shape and ex- pression of the latter were totally unlike. , Unlobservant of everything about him, he stoood nonchalant-effortless. I observed him closely. There was a restless kind-of impa- tience and scorn in his face', which was not agreeable. He wore the air of a person'  strongly discontented with himself, and with the world about him; of one whose striving, if he ever strove, hiad not been successful; -whose aim, if he had any, was either too high or too low for his spirit's peace. Thoughtful I knew him to be, from the look of his brow, but there was an absence of happy light in his eyes, and a determination to control himself, and yet again a spurning of all control, in his manner, which puzzled, while it interested me exceedingly. He appeared to me a Prome-   "  - - 3NEW FA CES- BITTERNESS. theus, ;untamably rebellious, bearing the tort- ures of a secret agony, with a scornful, but not patient, stoicism. Something 'cruel in his destiny goaded him. "Day, to this man," I said to myself, " brings little pleasure ; night affords him no solace or rest." And yet, what has he hot apparently at command? There seemed not a youth in all- the land who possessed a better or fairer fortune than he. I had no need to seek further, however, for him whose taste and skill had decorated the mansion at Glen-Beck. With eyes dropped on thes book in my lap, I had unconsciously fallen into meditation. There was much in the characters of those about me that afforded food for thought, and I willingly allowed my mind to' dwell on a new topic, since it gave me relief from a sad one, which had been'-of late too. constantly a sub- ject of reflection. A weak, hesitating voice aroused me: 'I Miss Wilmerton." I turned to the speaker. It was Frank. 'The- children's maid had taken, them away. J  some time before, and I was surprised to see   NEW FACES--BITTERNESS.    45 the timid little fellow returned and standing near nme.  "Sister Mildred wants you," he said half inaudibly. I arose at once, and taking the child's hand, went with him from the apartment. We had nearly reached the landing at the top of the stairs, when a sharp voice called- from a side- passage,    M "Master Frank, is that you? Come here this minute." Frank's hand tightened its clasp upon mine; he loolked up in my face earnestly, as if about to speak.     ' W' What is it, Frank?"I said, smiling, for I sa"w he needed encouragement. "Must-must we do sums to-morrow?" he asked. I was puzzled and not a little amused. Here was I for the first time listening to the question of a pupil; how, as teacher, should I answer? Stooping, I kissed the little fellow's cheek, and assured him that, if we did "do sums" next day, they should not be too difficult for him to comprehend.   "   NEgW FA CES--BITTERNESS. Again the maid's voice called impatiently, -and Frank hastened away.' A servant stood ,in the second hall, and witlh a "This is your Jroom, if you please, Miss Wilmerton," ushered me into a chamber near, and closed the door. I advanced a step or two into the apartment, and there stood. A fire was burning in- the grate, and lights were on the mantel-shelf. I -looked about me.' For an instant I believed  myself in my own room in Elliot Place. There were my own' bed, and my dressing-bureau, before whose glass I have stood so often in happier days. -My little dimity-covered arm- chair was drawn close to the fire, as if I had only just risen from it, and there, beside the window, stood my own boudoir bookcase, in the very place it had occupied in my own apartment-in my father's-house. On its shelves were ranged the books it had cost me so much to relinquish, and 'which I believed I had parted with forever at the auction sale two i- months before.  My breath came fast. Did I dream?  What spell held me? I put out my ; 'hand and touched the marble slab  of the bureau. I approached and opened the book-  \'  ' , ' '   ,    NE W FA CES-BITTERNESS.   47 case, and passed my fingers fondly over the precious volumes. While thus engaged, an arm was thrown about my waist, and Mildred Forrester's lips touched miy cheek. In a moment .I comprehended all. How delicate and unlooked -for was this kindness. "'And so you were the good fairy," I said. ",I had begun to believe myself the victim of J enchantment, Miss Forrester." "Oh, I assure you, it was not all my doing," she rejoined, smiling. "Somebody else sug- gestled it, or it would never have entered my head ;" and she made an effort to change the subject. I; thanked her warmly. What I felt, it is impossible to describe. This beginning of my, governess life, was not- so dreary after all. Mildred looked embarrassed by my expres- sions of gratitude; and drew me 'away from the - -bookcase, towards -a picture which hung on the other side of the room.  "Besides your own little copy of the ' De- scent from the Cross,' which I was fortunate- in securing, she said, "I fancied the wall needed a picture just here, and had this removed 1  * .'  ' *    48   NE W FACES-BIT;TERNSS. hither. Brother Walworth brought it from Europe for me last year, but I have it so .by heart that I can well spare it to you." We looked at the picture together. Young Life was represented in the figure of a fair girl, laid in unconscious slumber in a l frail pleasure-boat, which- was rocked on the waves of a sumnier sea. A stronged-limbed, tall, and grandly proportioned steersman, Des- tiny, guided the bark. His ey-es were ban- daged, and gray locks were lifted by the night wind from a broad and furrowed brow.. A little to the right sat a grim, withered, Saturn figure, with his hour-glass and the cycle-rep- resenting serpent coiled about his decirepit' form, its tail in its own mouth. The painter must have possessed rare skill, for, in the dis- tance, roughening the waves, clouding the moon, and filling the slight sails with a pre-'  monitory and strengthening breeze, one was aware of the approach of the spirit of the storm, and became filled with a foreboding of the woe  soon to arouse the young Life laid in slumber  at. the feet of Destiny and Timne, dreaming, perchance, of Love, or Fame, or Fortune.   NEW FACCES-BITTERNESS.    49 And now I. have to apologize," Mildred said, when I had expressed my admiration of the painting, i" for sending for you thus early ; but I knesw that you would be thored to death inI the drawing-room with nobody-to talk to, sinie I am engaged to go out this evening, and papa, mamma, and brother Walworth accom- pany me. Lolotte is waiting to dress my -hair, but I wozld come and see you at home in your, own room first.", I looked at her as she stood with her white wrapper gathered about her tall, slender fig- ure, and. thought how lovely she was. Her golden-brown hair had been hurriedly caught up and fastened with a small silver comb, and her exquis ite face, -flushed and animated, looked out from amid the half looped-up curls with a perfectand. surpassing beauty,  "Belle Mildred! .belle et bonne," I said almost involuntarily. It was the first line of a poem composed by our French teacher, on the, occasion of Mildred's being crowned May- queen. A vivid blush spread over her face, and her violet eyes took a brighter lustre. "Ah!" she said, "I see you have not for-   NEW FACES-BITTERNESS.    ' gotten those old, old times. But Bessie, why do you wear your hair in those plain, bands? I: beg your pardon, but it makes a perfect Quakeress of you. What have you done with your curls?  "A governess," I replied, "has little time or need for such adornments. I have worn it thus ever since I 'knew I was to teach." "How absurd!" she exclaimed,. "  am quite vexed at you. But indeed you must wear it in the old style sometimes to please' me. Do you remember our drawing-master's- Signor Ilzoni's-penchant for you? The girls used to say he raved about your Madonna face, and hair such as Rubens would have 'lovaed to catch de sonneliglit upon." She ended with a perfect mimicry of our old drawing-master's manner and expression, but I turned away. There was another who, too, would have been vexed at my wearing my hair thus. Now what change had come. There was a light tap at the door. Mildred opened it. "I am coming, Lolotte," she said;  then turning to me, "Ring the bell, Bessie, if you want anything, and Lolotte or Kitty     ---1NEnW FCES-BZITTERNESS. 5 will answer it. Has your trunk been brought up?" It had, and she hastened away, for it was growing late. Erelong she reappeared upon my chamber threshold, dressed in gossamer white. The delicate texture floated around her, and seemed to envelop her like a mist, out of which- gleamed two fair, jewelled arms stretched towards me. "One kiss, and good-night, Bessie," she said, and the vision was gone. There was a slight bustle in the house, then' a sound of carriage-wheels, and at last an utter silence. Feeling some fatigue after the day's excitement, I determined to overcome the desire- to indulge in a melancholy reverie, which had become a habit of late, and go to bed. I undressed, read my chapter as usual, and knelt, as my nightly custom had ever been, upon the floor before my chair, making it the altar to which I brought confession and petition. But now no words of prayer came to my lips. Thought overcame devotion. I sought to make a compact with myself. If an accustomed subject, which it goaded    52   NEW FACES--BITTERNESS. me to think upon, was avoided, I would allow my mind to dwell on other things for a space. Deceived with Thought's apparent, consent, I let Mildred and the prospect of her sweet. companionship engage me. Already we had agreed to read and translate German together. This was pleasant, and 'I 'went back to our early school-days, to our earnest friendship then, and wondered, very naturally, that it 'had not occurred to me that my former schoolmate, Milly Forrester, was-the daughter. ' of my employer. Presently an unlooked for and mournful recollection of the Past brought me full against the rock I dreaded, and with a malison on my false Thought, I struck it out madly into the. sea. This time it made a wide circuit, but it  'came steadily round again. From following the dear ones on their Western journey; from wondering if Kate was lonely at, Madame Merillat's; from dwelling on my position in'  Mr. Forrester's family, and the duties incum- bent upon me, it veered and veered, until- the I old point was struck once more. Lacerated heart and weary brain gave token of the it's           '      NR- E FA CES--BITTERNESS.   53   pain I endured., Erelong I was weeping at the wildest rate, and swaying back and forth with. the violence of my. emotion. "Is this never to end? Is Lawrence Esterlyh never to break the silence between us? If he had only confided to me about the pamphlets! Now- if he suffers as I do, surely he will forgive the fault in time. But when? With beatings of the breast, .with an anguished sense of remorseful self-blame, I may cry out, 'lica cu1pa:, mea czl-pa, mea maxima cztlpa,' but the fault is not atoned for; the sinned against cannot hear the cry or witness the expiation. But oh! Lawrence seems to me at times more inexorable than a god. I put the:thotught away, but it comes and comes, and maddens me with the conviction that he loved me not- strongly or well, since he could give me up in a day." And the weeping went on, till, far in the night, I heard the approach of the carriage which brought Mildred home, and fearing lest she should see my tears, and inquire their cause, I extinguished my light, and crept wearily to bed.    CHAPTER IH.

Stretching in pensive quietness between; The venerable woods; rivers that move In majesty, and the complaining brooks That make tie meadows green." BRYANT. H tzamlet,-c"Alas! poor Ghost! *    b ' SHAKESPEARE. GLEN-BECK was a lovely place in summer, where the leaves rustled, and the birds sang, and merry-voiced waters leaped to the sunlight, while stately mountains kept grim guard, in the distant background., All along the, high-road from the City of M--, for the distance of eight or ten miles,   GLEN-BECXK-MRS.

Vistas were opened through groups of trees, whose growth had shut out pleasant prospects; upland and vale were cleared and planted anew; and water, brought from its rocky source, rose and fell again into marble basins, with a re- joicing sound, through all the summer-time. The forest Dryad, the Oread from the hills, and fountain-watching Naiad, might seek no fairer home. The mansion, which stood on an elevation, was large, built of a kind of grayish stone, modern in architecture, and strong in struct- ure. It was approached from the high-road. by a carriage-way leading through trees to the great front entrance, from which a path di- verged on either hand, and led round the sides    '- -A s   -iw- '             y'-" 'v" 56    - GLEN-BE CK-MRS. GRE Y. of the house, to a large garden in the rear; where the ground, fell withl a few gentle un- dulations to the- banks of a small stream, which,still retained its Indian name, Monos- Ikisy. On the other side of this stream a small house was built, where lived the gar- dener, Andy Ray, and his family. To the rig*htof the mansion, a country road wound past the garden hedgd, and the grounds be- yond it, for the distance of three-quarters of a  mile, leading to a large wooden bridge ex- tending across the river Wissitere, which here  ran parallel for a space with the small'stream that flowed through Mr. Forrester's grounds. To the left of the garden, and concealed from sight by large trees, stood a farm-house, occupied by Mrs. Grey,- whom my pupils called Nurse Matty, and who had been a sort of foster-mot er to all the children, from i -Walworth down to Lillian.' Mrs.-Grey's son  Robert took care of the, farm, which was in the rear of the house, and acted also as a sort Of steward for Mr. Forrester. On the other side of the river, and just be- yond the bridge,: lay the little village of More- -      '-t. ,   GLEN-BECKZ-MRS. GREY.    57  - ton at the foot of one of the mountains, which, rising gradually from the water's edge, ex-, tended the, distance of some miles along the river shore, or rather along its shores, for the elevated ground upon which Glen-Beck stood, rose, a mile, farther down, into mountains also. I have often beheld the -sun set in the gap of these mountains formed by the passage of the Wissitere, and never elsewhere have I looked on more gorgeous cloud-coloring, which was here  alike beautiful, whether Nature was decked in .spring verdure, crowned with midsummer loveliness, or clothed in the  changing hues of autumn. A story and a ghost were both associated with Glen-Beck. Mrs. Grey told me the one, and hinted at the existence of the other, during one of my first visits to her son's farm, which the children, accompanied by Kitty, were in the habit of visiting as often as once a week. The story ran -thus : The. property now called Glen-Beck had been purchased by the man- at whose hands Mr. Forrester had obtained it, from a Dutch farmer, who held it as his own by reason of a kind of   58    GtLEN-BEC:K-MRS. GREY. sale which had been made to himself and his father by some Indians, the original possessors of the land. The Dutchmen wanted a farm; the Indians (some six in number) money with which to procure " fire-water." A bargain was struck. For a's much land as a certain quantity of deer-skins would cover, the Dutch- men promised to pay annually a small sum of. money to each Indian, until he (the Indian) died. This seemed fair enough. But when the land came to be measured, the white knaves did not lay the skins upon the ground, as the. simple red men had expected, but cut them linto narrow strips, andc fastening these together, cqalled all that portion of ground which the string thus made enclosed in a circle, their own. -                    i  The Indians, out-witted and wronged, sub- mitted, for there was no redress. After a time, as might have been anticipated, it became a hard matter for the Indians to obtain the pay- ment of the annual sum from the crafty Dutch- men. Secure in possession, they grudged the money, small as was the amount, and this injus- tice frequently led to bitter quarrels. A few   GLEN-BECK-MRS. GREY.     59 years elapsed. Five of the Indians were dead. The sixth, a stalwart, evil-looking fellow, seemed to lead a charmed life. He escaped untold times from perils by water, and when small-pox raged among his tribe, thinning its ,numbers to a score, he was left untouched. Lightning struck down a comrade at his side in [the forest, and he remained unharmed. Fire devastated whole squares of a city to which he had gone to make a sale of skins, and the house in which he was fell about its inmates, crushing them to death. He alone was saved alive. It was his custom to drink fearlessly of the " fire-water," which he craved with an in- satiate appetite; it stupefied but could not kill him. Year after year he visited the Dutch- men. His hair grew white, his strong form bowed; but he possessed strength enough to make his annual visit, and sense sufficient to prefer his request and receive his payment. His debtors might have resisted; his demand, but they dreaded his revenge. The tribe of ! -Mohawks lived near, and, instigated by the old Indian, might do them a sudden injury. At length, exasperated by his prolonged exist-    60    GLEN-BECK-MRS. GREY..  ence, the Dutchmen resolved no longer to be troubled by this yearly visitor. The next time he" came, they gave him liquor to drink, until, senseless and inert, he became an easy victim. They did not kill him by a heavy blow, or a 'dagger's thrust; but, carrying him away to the forest; they dug a deep grave, and there buried:'  him,;piling-earth-clods upon the living form of the wronged old Indian. Not long after this, the elder Dutchman died-of remorse, it was  thought. His younger son soon followed'lhim,  and the remaining brother (who, it is said, looked more like a corpse than any living man) sold the farm, and removed from the neighbor-  hood. How he fared, when far away from the  scene of his own and his father's crime, and  the manner of his death, are not known. The inhabitants of the vicinity aver that at  night, and- sometimes by day, in the dark for-  est, an old Indian has been seen gliding among  the trees; and once, it is asserted, he was ob- served standing in the white mnoonlight, at the very gates of Glen-Beck., "Mrs. Grey,' I said, as she concluded, "do you believe in the ghostly part of this story?-"   GLEN-BECI- MURS. GRE Y.    61 '( Hcan find you many hereabouts who do," she replied, evading my question. "I am glad the children have not heard you tell this story," I said, after a pause. "I never tell these things to the children," she replied, gravely. I looked at her. There was a very serious expression in her face, and I was vexed at my- self for doubting for a moment either her sense or principle. Whatever her superstition might be in the case, I was convinced that she had too much moral feeling to fill the minds of the children with what could only render them uneasy and fanciful. "Forgive me, Mrs. Grey," I said. "Let me atone for my fault by apologizing." "' There is no need of apology, Miss Bessie," she returned. "I respect you'for the thought of the children, but indeed, you may judge them safe with Nurse AMatty." From this time quite an attachment sprung up between the good nurse and myself. I ad- mire-l her fair, open brow, her intelligent gray eyes, and the gentle, kindly manner to all. She was an Englishwoman, possessed of some ,        .   62   OGLEtN-BECK- MRS. GRE Y. education and the highest moral and religious principles. Both Walworth and Mildred had been left much in her care, when they were children, and it was to her, I afterwards learned, they owed the high notions of honor which influenced their conduct in a remarkable de- gree. They bore a strong attachment to her, and Mildred especially took every opportunity of manifesting her affection, and I observed that to Mrs. Grey her mere presence was a delight. For YWalworth, Nurse M4tty enter- tained a respectful regard, but to "Miss Milly," as she named her, she gave the fondness and love of a mother. With her Mildred might be as exacting as she pleased; it was a joy to wait upon her darling, and although she came almost daily to Glen-Beck, she was never so happy as when Mildred spent some hours of an afternoon with her at the farm. After a timle, when we became better ac- quainted, Mrs. Grey talked to. me sadly about Walworth. His melancholy and restlessness, With the great change in his habits, she averred, puzzled and distressed her. "He used to be the gayest lad," she said; -" and when he sobered   GLEN-BE CK-MRS. GRE Y.   63 down after comingfrom Europe, he was yet joyous-like and kindly; but now there was a great change. A sore trouble weighed upon him," she feared. "How long has he been so altered?"I in- quired. "For the past- four or five months," she answered. "'Oh! Miss Bessie," she added, you should have seen him, when the house at Glen-Beck was building. He managed, he directed everything,. and somehow there was no trouble ; all seemed to go right. His father never interfered with his. plans, for not a soul at Glen-Beck thinks Mr. Walworth can do wrong, and his mother drove out from town, every week, to see how the work progressed. Mr. Walworth lived at the farmthen, in order that he might be on the spot with the masters and workmen, and Miss Milly came and spent some weeks with me. It was a pleasant sum- mer for us all, but now Mr. Walworth is very unlike his own old self; " and she sighed in a kind of sorrowful perplexity. ^ ^ ^^ 'I ,: ..  ..    . -  ,H .   Ir CHAPTER   IV.            i GOVERNESS LIFE-'WALWORTH-MLDRED?         j! -MRS.

Must he stand?" Or, "Miss Wil- merton, mustTommy lean on my chair?"Or, "Lillian -went out of the room without per- mission, Miss Wilmerton." Endless were the tiresome repetitions of similar complaints, until I discountenanced tale-bearing, by taking no notice of the offend- ers. The habit, I saw, had a most pernicious effect upon the dispositions of the children, maling them unkind and disputatious, and very often unreasonable and unjust. There were other faults, the result of Mrs. Marchmont's harsh discipline, which yielded in time to quiet surveillance on my part, and perhaps a gentler government.  One benefit resulted from her teaching, however, which I could not but ac- knowledge.  The lessons were admirably learned and well recited. From the first, I was not a little surprised at my pupils' acquirements, which were far be- yond most children of their age. They were gifted also to a certain extent, for each of the three possessed great skill and taste in draw- ing.  Even Tommy, who was matter-of-fact   ". GOVERNESS LITE-MRS.. SEYTOU.       X and prosaic in many respects, displayed, an ' ardor for improving himself in this accomplish- ment, unusual in a boy of his years. The frequent prese ce of their brother Walworth, during the hour for drawing, was, it is prioba- ble, a great inducement for the children to do well. His' instructions were useful and well- timed, and he possessed, in a rare degree, the genius to be obeyesd. The idol of his parents, there was not one in all the household who ,did not hold him in the highest esteem, and  by his brothers and sisters he was regarded  with a half-reverent and unquestioning affec- tion.  When he condescended, therefore, to show a persevering interest'in any one pursuit of theirs, it is not strange that my pupils  'should be ambitious to merit from him words i of encouragement and approbation. With the exception of drawing, however, no one inter-, fered with my   instruction of the children. They were never withdrawn from their lessons on any pretext, and their moral training was left entirely in my hands. At first, I could not but shrink  from the responsibility this in- volved; I  was weighed down with it;' but }    -     t'A   GOVERNESS LIFE-MRS. SEYTOUN.   67 after an interval of honest and patient en- deavor, the success I met with encouraged and strengthened me. The commencing week of my governess life I was disagreeably impressed with the- serious nature of the charge I had undertaken, and made to feel, for the first time, how truly a teacher needs the co-operation of the parent. It was recess, and yet half an hour before the usual time for commencing recitations. The children sat near me in the school-room, while I, busily engaged in sewing, revolved in my mind the thoughts that never ceased to -weigh upon and trouble me. Suddenly, Frank looked up from a -new drawing, which he had begged me to allow him to " sketch in," before school-time, and asked Tommy to lend him a quarter of a dollar, since his week's allowance was all spent.      t "Gone to that confounded old woman at the Village, and her- lame Philip, I'll bet," said Tommy. (' Beg your pardon, Miss Wilmer- ton," he said, in deprecation of my look of re- proof. "Frank never saves a cent of his money."   68  GO VERINESS LITE HMRS. SEYTO UAN,  "That is not true," interrupted Lillian, ";you know he saved eter so much, when you  were at Uncle Roslyn's."   ^   ^ - Well," said Frank, returning to the point, i "will you lend me the twenty-five cents? I want it very much."            i "How much will you give me for interest?"  askedTommy.- "Papa never lends his money  without getting interest for it, and I don't mean to lend mine for nothing."  "How much do you want?" inquired  Frannk.-    '     - - 6- "Well, let me see," rejoined Tommy, with I 1 an air of calculation. "I'll let you have it, if you pay me next week, when you get your allowance, and - sixpence beside. Isn't that  fair?"    ;  Frank agreed, and stretched out his hand for the money, which Tommy proffered him.  Lillian's attention had been withdrawn from her French lesson, which she was studying,  and she now looked earnestly at me. I felt it' would not do to' allow Tommy's conduct to pass without comment. "Tommy," said I, " when your father lends    GOVERNESS LIFE-MRS. SE'YTOUN. 69 money, he asks only six, seven, or at most, ten cents, on every hundred cents borrowed from him,; while you require one-fourth of tihe money you lend to Frank for interest. This seems to me unfair." "Beside," said Lillian, quoting from her arithmetic, "the laws of the State will not permit of more than seven cents interest on the dollar."  "I don't care," returned Tommy, "Frank  has agreed, and it's a bargain." "It would have been much more noble and, generous," I said, " to lend your brother the money without requiring interest. I am very sure that it would not have- occurred to Frank to take from you one cent beside the money you wished to borrow, had he been the lender."  "Well, he may do as he pleases," answered . Tommy, very pettishy. "Papa says that I will- make a business -man-a real sharper. You should have heard him laugh the other day when I told him I had sold my Shanghai . , hen to old John Thompson for four- dollars,  when it only cost me two. I kept it in the ,   70  GO VVERNES LIFE--MRS SE YTO UN.   ; coop, and let him take coop and all, that he might nobt find out it was lame." And he laughed and whistled with exceeding satis-    faction.                 I I was troubled, perplexed. What could I - do, when father and child were thus agreed?  "Do you know your lesson in French, Lil- lian? I asked, willing to end the debate for s the time., "I will hear you recite now," I  I  added, when she signified that it was corn-  mitted, disregarding Tommy's loud assertion  \ that it lacked yet some minutes of the hour   for recitation. By a little management I so arranged that the children's tasks were performed this day, earlier than usual, leaving me a little time be-  fore the close of school. I then read to them the Scriptural account of Dives and Lazarus, and taking for a text the passage from John,  "It is easier for a camel to go throughz the eye  of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of -teaven."' I gave them a short  lecture upon worldliness and love 'of gain:  upon life, death, and eternity. I sought to   make them comprehend that the years of our     G O VERvESS LIFE-MRS. SE YTOUN.  7 I life here were, at best, few, and that the great Father would require from us an account of the manner in which these years were spent. I described death and the judgment; I con- trasted Heaven with Hell, and had the satis- faction of beholding my young  listeners touched and impressed. They went away quietly, and I spent the remainder of the after- noon in serious reflection on the characters of the three. Despite the care weighing upon me, how- ever, and the obstacles, unavoidable and fre- quent, which I met with; the children, espec- ially Frank and Lillian, became very dear to me. Tommy was not so easily impressed, nor ;so attachable. He preferred driving sharp bargains withhis boy friends, or going, if per- mitted, to the city with his father, to walking with me, as the others did, when the day's recitations were ended, about the grounds, or- to the little village of Moreton, the distance of  a mile and a half from Glen-Beck, where re-  sided the pastor of the Episcopal churchk which Mr. Forrester's family attended, by  whom we were always welcomed with warmth    72  GOVER'NNESS LIFE-MRS. SE YTOUN. and hospitably entertained. Tommy was thus, in many respects, less directly under my influ- ence, and lost much of the information which J it was my endeavor to impart at every oppor- tunity. In time, Frank and Lillian became  i quite intelligent companions, and our walks were to them, as well as to me, a source of en- joyment. Beside the hours spent withl the children, ,much of lmy time was profitably employed in  pursuing -the study-of German with Mildred. Krummacher's Parables . at first, and later, j Goethe and Schiller, well repaid us for a close , study of the language, -'and long afternoons were spent over their pages in unwearied ap- t plication. We were often joined by Mr. MWal-  worth Forrester, who, although more at home  in the language than we, still seemed to enjoy  our reading and discussion of the beauties and separate characteristics of each author, render-  ing for us difficult passages with the greatest ! fluency. His description of Goethe's house  i at Weimar, which he had visited when in Eu- i! rope, was very entertaining, just at the time I when we were feeling-the greatest interest in  i *   GOViERNESS LIFE-MRS. SEYTOUN.   73 this celebrated man. Wal-worth's account of his mode of life, and personal habits, many of them peculiar'and coarse, brought us to a com- preheinsion of him as a human being, although' his genius lost some of its exaltation to our - minds, by a knowledge of the faults and weak- nesses of the man. But very frequently when Walworth was with us, our lesson was forgotten for other- things. Art, high ,art, was often our topic, and I could not but be struck with the ani- mated enthusiasm of Walworth, and surprised at Mildred's knowledge. The first visit he paid us was the occasion of a sort of lecture upon art. From the time of the culmination of Athenian art, 'he came down to our own day, dwelling upon the progress of the world, de- spite retrograde influences, until he made us feel how great was the force of the aspiration whichl has carried the human race on and up in its advancement. Poetry, painting, sculpt- ure; how Walworth was transformed when upon these subjects. Eloquence flowed from his lips, light flashed from his -eyes, and- we gazed on his irradiated countenance until we 4-   74  GOVERNESS LIFZ--MRS. SEYTO UN. caught a portion of his enthusiasm, and felt I some of the scorn that curled his lip, when he spoke of the-martyrs to art, left to, pine in pov-  erty by a world which has never been worthy   j of its gifted ones. I owe to Walworth much  that is useful in my knowledge and correct in my taste. Enjoying his conversation as I1 did, I wel- corned his presence at our lesson time with a pleasure I cared not to conceal. But, our dis- cussion over, our interest cooled, Walworth  was his disagreeable self again, proud and cold, though visibly tortured by the secret  pang. Prometheus, who had for a time for- gotten the rock and the vulture, became sen-  sible of his chain and the preying' agony once more. He was a perfect Sphinx to me, and the 'temptation to unravel his sad secret became . my besetting fault. I studied -his;countenance,  acquainted myself with his habits, and viewed  with a romantic interest the commonest act of 4 his daily life. Mildred showed me at different periods various published essays of his upon his favorite subjects, and my ardent appre-    GOVERNESS LIFE-MRS. SEYTOUN.   7 5 ciation of their depth of knowledge and beauty and perfection of style delighted her. It was a keen pleasure to her to listen to my praise of him; yet her . most idolatrous affection was unsatisfied with any but the warmest eulogiums of his talent and skill. But while I praised, I' could have wept for him also, so greatly did his silent misery move me. Mildred seemed utterly ignorant of any cause of wretchedness on his part, and though aware of a certain grow- ing coldness and pride about him, attributed it to the misapprehension to which her father had been subjected, and which her brother, she said, resented, as was natural. "Ever since the failure of the Talbot Bank, brother has seemed stern and cold," she said, "for papa has somehow been connected with Uncle Erastus, whom people blame greatly for what could not be helped. If there were no funds, the bank must stop payment you know, Bessie, and unfortunate investments of money are often made by cashiers, with the very best intentions." j.  I was amazed at her ignorance, but held my peace. This lack of knowledge on her part was   X 76 GOVERNESS: LIFE- - RS. SE YTO UN. bliss for the time, but I foresaw that it could not be lasting. Her brother, however, could not but be aware of the light in which the commu- nity of M  viewed the failure of the Talbot Bank, and of his own father's implication in the "fraud," as it was unhesitatingly termed by almost every paper of the State.  Was this the secret of his wretchedness? I I could not be certain, though many circum-  g stances induced me to think my surmise cor- C  rect.       '  I The cause of Mildred's ignorance of her  I father's and her uncle's standing in the eyes of  many- of the: most sensible and just-judging of 0 the community, wa's for a time a problem I  i found- it difficult to solve. I could not under-  stand why, though months had elapsed since  '  the failure of the Talbot Bank, she yet compre- A  hended no one of the disgraceful particulars;  the very servants in the house whispered darkly their opinions to one another; and I  perceived. that Tommy got little sympathy  J 'from them when he returned from town one , day, with a bruised and blackened face, which  he said had been -given him by a-blacksmith's i   GOVERNErSS LIFE-MRS. SEYTOUN.   " boy when he resented his calling him a " bank- robber's son." The' honest and hard-working part of the community judged the failure most severely, and one could not but be struck with the sober and truthful sentiments they expressed, de- livered, though they often were, in simple lan- guage enough.  Walking one day in the garden, I overheard  Andy, Ray express so freely: his opinion to an acquaintance, that I wondered what had become of the "canny Scot's" accustomed reserve. After a sweeping condemnation of all those whose names were connected with the fraudulent fail- ure, he quoted these lines from Burns in his rich accent: "Where'er ye feel your honor grip, Let that aye be your border." And I honored the dead poet more than ever, since his words served to keep alive noble sen- timents in the breasts of the humblest of his countrymen. But unconscious of all that was making the very atmosphere of her home full of con-  Aip . -   78  GOVERANESS LIFE-MRS. SEYTOU N.  demnatory whispers, Mildred passed on heri! way, happy in her own fancies, occupied with her innocent pursuits? and thinking, if . she 'ver gave the subject thought, that her uncle, and through him he father, had been most unjustly blamed, at he failuire of the . Talbot"Bank, by people who could not, or would not, see the truth without prejudice.  'It was not until I discovered that she never read the daily papers, that I found a clue to her mysterious ignorance which had astonished me from the first. For some time after my arrival at Glen-Beck, I had endeavored, but  in vain, to. obtain, the paper of the day. It  could never be found, and I had recourse to   i Mildred.           - -  She laughed gayly at my perplexity.  We are forbidden to read the daily papers now,"' she said. "Papa tells us that evil-dis: - posed persons say shameful things of both Uncle Erastus and himself, which it would pain us to read; and so mamma locks away the obnoxious journals. For my part," she added, carelessly," I do not care to read them." And therefore I was obliged to send to the    GO VERNESS LIFE-MRS. SEYTOUN.   79 editors for the journals, since I had promised my father to keep him advised of certain matters, knowledge of which could only be obtained fronm these sources. But I also locked them from sight, determined, that no careless- ness of mine should expose  o Mildred facts which could not fail to make one, whose pur- poses and 'aims were true and noble, unspeak- ibly wretched. ' And thus the Commissioners' Report on the ralbot Bank was delivered, the trial of the Cashier and Directors begun, carried on; and finished, without Mildred's having learned a jot or tittle of the truth. The exposure of the facts, regarding the transactions of Mr. 'Erastus and Mr. Stephen Forrester, caused a change in many of their friends, which would have sur- prised her, had not satisfactory and most plausible reasons been given by the adroit mother, when the coldness of former acquaint- ances was commented on by her daughter. Mrs. Forrester's and Mildred's names were struck from the visiting list of several old fami- lies of stainless pedigree, whose honest'natures recoiled from association with'perjured and dis-   80   GO VERNESS LIFE-- MRS. SE YTOUN.  honorable men. But there were numbers less  'scrupulous found to supply their places and offer  that homage to Mr. Forrester's wealtlh which must be denied to the character of the man.   A After the issue of the trial, although     I "cleared," to use a common though expres-    I sive term, by the exertions of his extrava-  i gantly paid lawyers, Mr. Erastus Forrester     left the State, and many said; the country, so  I great was the odium attached to his name.   . , His young wife, who knew   nothing of the  journey, until she, learned his departure, re-  turned to her widowed mother with her infant  children. I remember a fair and gentle though  S extremely sad-looking lady, Who came, the  I! first week of my arrival at Glen-Beck, and re- mained but a day, despite the urgent entreaties i of Mrs. Forrester-to make alo0nger visit. She . ! was called Aunt Margaret by Mildred, and i when dressing for dinner, Lolotte, who came  vith a  message from Mildred, informed me of he departure of Mrs. Erastus Forrester. Scarcely a  month afterward the tidings came of her death. Mildred and her mother wore mourning for the space of time  Mrs.   GO VERNESS IZFE--MiRS: SEZYTOUN, 8U I Forrester learned was requisite, according to the conventional code which she made her rule of observance. At first Mildred wept a great deal, and always looked sad when her aunt's name was mentioned, but- by the rest of the household she seemed to be utterly forgotten. Gentle creatures pass often from earth thus, there perhaps there are few to keep them in emembrance; but I thought of her early death with a tender pity, and questioned whether the husband now absent would ever weep over the grave of the wife he had forsaken. Shortly after young Mrs. Forrester's death, fragile-looking, elderly lady came for a day's sojourn at Glen-Beck. It was Mrs. Ceytoun, Mrs. Erastus, Forrester's mother. like her daughter, she could not be persuaded remain.' Pleading for excuse the failing health of her only remaining child, she begged that a messenger might bhe sent to the' city for Mr. Forrester, whom she had come to see on an urgent matter of business, intending to leave early the next day. Upon my intro- duction to her at dinner, she had looked at me with a startled and peculiarly sad gaze,  :--,                ..   82  GOVERNESS LIFE- -MRS. SEYTOUN. which I often encountered- during. the meal,' and once or twice befoire sh'e retired, which she did at a very early hour. In bidding me good-night, she pressed my hand tenderly in both her own, and' again looked earnestly at me'as she left the apartment.- A kiss the next morning awakened me. On opening my eyes, they encountered the tearful ones of the lady of the last night--Mrs. Seytoun. "I trust you will pardon me," she said, while she parted the tangled tresses away from my forehead, "- but you wear in your face a loqk myodead Margaret had, and I could not leave this morning without seeing you once more.  Have I disturbed you, 'my dear-?" Her tone, at once so mild and sor- rowful, touched me.- I put up my arms impul- sively and clasped her neck. She held me a moment to her bosom, pressed upon my lips a close, trembling kiss, that ended in a sob- bing sigh, looked once more earnestly at me, and was gone. A fortnight afterwards the news of Amy Seytoun's death reached Glen-Beck. Mrs. Seytoun was a-childless widow . '   ' g       .   CHAPTER V.

In putting these letters away, I touched ac- cidentally the spring of a secret-drawer in the little boudoir bookcase, which my father had caused to be made expressly for my use. I had forgotten to examine this repository on the day I had prepared the bookcase for the sale, and now upon an inadvertent pressure it sprang from its concealment. Here I found flowers, withered blossoms, plucked and given me years before, by Larry Esterlyn, when I scarce knew what the fragrant tokens served to represent; yet I put- them carefully away then, and here they were now, and where was he, and what was I? Large drops fell from my eyes upon the scentless petals; heart- wrung and bitter tears for a faded pabt. I wept unrestrainedly. "Mother!  Mother!  I cried in a passionate woe, "if I might lie in your arms--be pressed to your bosom! Your. unfailing love, your strength and tenderness, are all that I may henceforth claim." A step approached, and a hand was laid   ;y cffl[ lMJrfa ^^ -J ^ 5* ^B       - -a 88   LETTERS. FROM T4SE M'EST. upon the fastening of the door.  It was locked, and I sat unmoved while the handle was gently turned in an ineffectual effort to gain admittance. Soon I heard retreating steps-Mildred's, I conjectured; and closing the drawer with an averted countenance, I arose, bathed my flushed face, smoothed my. - hair, and dressed for dinner, for it was near sunset. Then I descended to the garden, and "' walked up and down one of its least-fre- quented paths, until the bell summoned me to the dining-room.- Mildred was standing upon the piazza steps, when I approached from a side walk. "Where have you been, Bessie?" she said, as soon as she perceived me. "I have sought everywhere for you, truant, in vain." - There was a new joyous sound in her voice, and as I looked up at her, I became aware of an added beauty in her face, impossible to - describe. i'Where have you been?" she repeated, smiling down upon' me.  "'Where had you hidden, Bessie,?" -   ; "What have you been doing to yourself?"     , S    gs \ '.    "ETTERS FROM THE WEST.    - 89 I asked, looking at her, and disregarding her questions.

"Did size put three smiles, instead of one, into the corners of your mouth? I repeat, what have you been doing to yourself?" "What nonsense you are talking, Bessie," she: said, blushing. "Hark! I hear papa's voice in' the hall. He is going in to dinner. Come,"  And putting her arm through mine, we entered the dining-room by one of its win- dows, which opened upon the piazza. Mildred was more than usually quiet during the meal, and when a servant entered with a note for her mother, I observed her anxiously scan her face during its perusal. After an exclamation of satisfaction, Mrs. Forrester was about to read the note aloud, when Mil- dred, in attempting to offer me a dish of some vegetable, let it' fall suddenly, breaking the china and scattering the contents. :' Poulett," said Mrs. Forrester,* addressing -   900  LETTERS FROM THE WEST. the waiter, "you should be more attentive. Miss Mildred cannot lift those heavy dishes. Mildred, my love," she added, "do not at- tempt such a thing again." Mildred's face was scarlet, and observed that Walworth watched her with a covert smile. "Mother," he said, still keeping his eyes fixed on Mildred's face, "what does Dana Poinsett say, for I presume that note to be from him?":              i " He regrets," replied Mrs. Forrester, "that an unlooked-for and late visit from a friend prevents his coming to dinner, but he v hopes to be able to see us in the evening." Mildred's- fork rattfled .down upon her plate. Her hand was strangely unsteady. "Mildred," said Walworth, mischievously, "pray do not break any more china. I can- not say what effect it will have upon my  I nerves."  Mildred's. red lips, pouted, but she did not raise her eyes to glance at her brother, and& soon after we rose from table. On entering the drawing-room, I sought and found a book of new prints which I had 1  ,    ^   .  *  *  ..   i LETTERS FROM THE WES.     91t been interrupted in examining the day before. [t was soon finished, and I turned to observe Mildred, who sat- near me, for I had a habit of looking at, her whenever an opportunity of- fered: her beauty was so rare in its character, not without a nameless fascination. Her cos- tume this evening was very becoming. The exceeding fairness of her complexion con- trasted well with her dress, which was-of blue silk, of that peculiar color called the a sreline shade. I took a quiet pleasure in looking at her, and regarded her some time unobserved, for her eyes were bent upon the intricate pattern of her work. Suddenly arosy tide dyed neck and throat; and the color in her cheek, that had before been not much larger or deeper than a rose-leaf, deepened into a crimson, I might not cover with the palm of my hand. I looked at her in the greatest surprise, and'was about to rally her on the thought that could send the blood to her cheek like that, when the door opened and the servant announced Mr. Poinsett. Had Mildred heard his entrance? I could hot tell;.    92   LETTERS FROM- THE WEST. My introduction to Mr. Poinsett over, I looked at htm with interest, for Mildred's man- ner had awakened curiosity.

Masses of short, nut- brown curls, lay above a broad, white brow, and peculiarly tender, thoughtful eyes gave a character of alnmost 'feminine beauty to the upper part of his face; but on his exquisitely. chiselled lips there was an  expression of: firmness which it almost pained me to look'up- on. I I should expect from this man," I said to myself, "gentle, perhaps sad, yet very firm resolve, did any crisis in life require his yea or nay." I fancied a similarity between his face and that of the apostle John, in a picture of the Saviour and His disciples I had. somewhere seen, and busied in tracing a resemblance, I encountered his eyes more than once before\ I withdrew my own. It seemed that Walworth and he were old friends, classmates in college, and travelling companion? in Europe.  He was just returned from a short absence in a neighboring State. The University' at which Walworth and he had   "ETTERS FROzI THE WEST. :  93  graduated, and of which they were at the mo- ment speaking, was the same with which Law- rence Esterlyn was connected. I dreaded, yet half expected, to hear his name; for his was an acquaintance I thought men like these would  not be likely to look upon with indifference. But the mention was not made. Soon they were speaking of the recent death of a cele- brated English -painter, who, living, had re- ceived little from men, save words of empty praise, and had died in extreme poverty. "He was a friend of the poet Keats, was he not'?" inquired Mildred. "Yes,' returned' Mr. Poinsett; 'he was strongly attached to the author of your favor- ite Endymion. But Mildred, you are forget-  ting rules," he said, casting upon her a sudden I archl glance. "Sie muissen mit mir immer - Deutsch sprechen."' She laughed at his inelegant phraseology, which he had used to test her, and then fol- lowed a lively conversation in German, in which Walworth proved himself the most cor- rect speaker, and .Mildred the most fluent talker. Her sentences followed rapidly, often   "94  LETTERS FROM THE WEST. at the -expense of a proper arrangement of substantives and verbs; for in her haste to utter her thought, she forgot rules, which per- haps at the- beginning she had learned but imperfectly.. Thus she made ludicrous mis- takes, which none laughed at with greater heartiness than herself. Mr. Poinsett's Ger- an sentences, like mine, required some pains I their construction before they could be -uttered, and -thus they were but slowly de- livered; but the exercise was improving and pleasant to us all., In the midst of one of Mildred's merry speeches, I suddenly recollected that I had promised the children a visit, as soon as Kitty should have left them safely in bed, in order to conclude a story which a shorter walk than( usual had not allowed me to finish. Making an excuse, I left the drawing-room in the hope of finding them yet awake; for I had been very particular in my admonitions in regard to truth-telling, and I might expect little good to follow my spoken precepts did I fail to prac- tise what I taught. On opening softly the nursery-door, three heads were raised from : ;or^- 18r---      .    t-     ' "ETTERS FROM THE WEST.    95 their respective pillows; the children were broad awake. Frank clapped his hands. ("There, Tommy," he said, "I knew she would come." "Miss Wilmerton always keeps her word," said Lillian. "I'm glad .of it," shouted Tommy. "Now efor the story." Lillian's confident words sounded like a re- proach. I thought how nearly I had given my pupils reason to doubt my respect for the truth. I was interrupted in the recital of the simple story, to which the children were listening with eager attention, by the hurried entrance of Mildred.                . "Come! Bessie," she said, "(we are to go to town immediately; papa, mamma, and all of  us. Madame Thayer gives a private concert, and Mademoiselle S  is to sing, for she and j Madtame are old friends. Walworth forgot all - aboutit till just now. Come, do come," she urged, half-impatiently, as she endeavored to draw me towards the - door. "Walworth will be so, vexed if you do not accompany us. ^^^ ^  ^--- ,- ,  rrqgrr ^--   96   LETTERS FROMf THE WEST. The concert does not commence till nine, and with fast driving we' shall reach M- just in time."  It had been my custom to refuse all invita- tions which Walworth and Mildred constantly sought to press upon my acceptance. I con- sidered it neither expedient nor proper to I enter into gayeties that could only serve to re- mind me of happier days.  Therefore, I now begged Mildred to excuse me. "But, Bessie," she began in an eager, coax- ing tone. "-Mildred," I interrupted, , the- carriage is at the door. They are waiting; " and I led her to the threshold. At this moment Walworth called us. - "Ah-! you are inexorable :as a Fate," she exclaimed, and hastened away. I finished the story for the children, planned with them  a forest walk for the morrow, and then  drawing the light curtains about their couches, left them to their happy rest. The moonlight lay in broad patches of silver . upon the floor of my room  when I entered it; I and advancing to one of the windows, I looked   "ETTERS FRO M THE WEST.    97 out for a time upon the garden scene'below; the' trees and river beyond, and the hills which skirted the'distant horizon. The thoughts that thickened in my birain confused and pained me. I almost wished I had accompanied Mildred to escape their merciless oppression; a conflict had been going on in my mind, when an inter-' val was allowed for thought since the discovery of the secret drawer beneath the book-shelves, and now my will was to decide it. When my preparations were making to enter upon my duties as governess, I col- lected and gave to my mother all the letters and tokens of affection I had at different times received from. Lawrence Esterlyn. She strengthened my determination to avoid the sight of everything that could excite or heighten my grief at his strange conduct, deerning it best in any case, since my life was henceforth to be among strangers. Thus, the. only thing which I could control that Lawrence had touched or looked upon, had been knowingly in my possession but a  few hours. The absence of the other tokens of his affection had not caused me to forget 5   98   LETTERS IROM TEMi WEST. him or even lessened my sorrow. Might I not keep this souvenir of a dead past? I went'  to the 'bookcase and took from its secret  j resting-place the withered bouquet. Should I destroy it? It would be weak to keep it; it. would be strong in me to scatter the pale leaves and brittle stens to the winds. At best, I could but brood over it with bitter tears and passionate regrets.      - For some minutes I stood in hesitancy. At length I slowly laid the bouquet again in its repository. Manhood's- strength would have cast the token from sight at once. Woman- hood's weakness cherished it for all time. ^  The atmosphere of the room became oppres- sive to me, and with a thought of the moon- lighted walks in the quiet garden, I left it and descended the stairs. As I passed the open  i door of the drawing-room, the deserted look  S of the large apartment had a kind of charm for me. Poulett had not extinguished the lights, and I entered and seated myself at the piano. I played at first old marches and waltzes -learned years before; then later music; but ere r---rlll "lr91 v *Idg*D1Wl   "ETTERS FROM THE WEST.     99 long I paused, and laying my head upon Mil- dred's open music-book, pressed my handker- chief tightly upon my lips, to smother the  a choking sobs that came despite my will and all t dictates of prudence. Suddenly something stirred in the piazza just outside one of the windows, the curtains of which had not been drawn; I looked, but saw nothing. The calm moonlight lay outside upon tree and shrub and balustrade, and the sad current of reflec- tion, arrested a moment, resumed its course. I thought of life, of what was required of me-of the future, of what'it had in store for me. Life's duties, the future's uncertainties, did not-look pleasant. I was appalled at the conflict I should have with my own nature, and foresaw a weary struggle to end at last with death. Then the thought came, "If I could die now; if I could lay down all respon- sibility at once." Here Conscience awoke; she reasoned sternly. ( Yes," she said, "I would like the freedom, the rest, the angel's crown and white wings, and blissful song, in the far, happy shore, ere one step of the long, narrow, and toilsome path thitherward was taken.   I00  LETTERS FROM THE ,WEST.  The voice of the,selfish, indolent evilwithin' me was to shrink from effort; was for an easy translation, to a happier existence. " A shadow crossing one of the windows and the sound of a cautious step startled me. I sprang to my feet, and stood for an instant terrified and helpless; the next, with the cour- age of desperation I fled fast along the hall, mounted the stairs, and reaching my room, locked the door in aftfrighted haste. A mo- ment after, I decided that it was my duty to alarm the servants. I rang the bell to sum- mon Lolotte, to. whom I told my fears. At her instigation, Poulett and Andy Ray, who was in the kitchen at the time, searched the house and grounds, but with no result. Evi- dently I had been mistaken, but for a time my heart beat painfully. The distant tones of Kitty's voice singing a ballad song to herself in the nursery, aided in restoring my self-pos- session, and presently I became convinced that my fears were groundless; that a cloud passing over the moon might have caused the appearance which I mistook for the shadow of- a human being outside the window, and my   "ETT7ERS FRO M  THE WES'T.     II imagination only heard the step.   With, the intention of awaiting Mildred's return, sleep surprised me, and I did not awaken until the sun shone brightly into my apartment.    - CHAPTER VI.

COUNTESS OF BLESSINGTON.  7  i I HAD 'not been two months at Glen- Beck, when Kate came, by Mrs. For-  rester's invitation, to spend a day with  ; me. The -children had a holiday given them,  at Walworth's suggestion; for he professed,    i himself well pleased with their progress in their lessons, and remembered a promise he had made them not' long before, to take the three together to the city. Left thus at leisure,. I spent with Kate hburs of quiet converse I had longed for with a yearning impossible to describe.   E-ELLICE MANVVERS-JEALOUSY. 103 The consideration that thus brought Kate and me together, was not an uncommon act of kindness. My position in Mr. Forresters  ily could not properly be called that of a teacher, although I received a salary and in- structed the  children. Owing to Walworth and Mildred, every attention that could have been offered the most favored visitor was mine, and my health was watched over, my tastes studied, and my simplest wish attended to. Understanding from his son, who learned from some incidental allusion of my own that I was fond of riding on horseback, Mr. Forrester placed at my disposal a well-trained and gentle horse, and Mildred and I were in the habit of cantering for an hour every morning about the pleasant roads in the environs of the city, at- tended by a servant. The exhilarating exer- cise proved very beneficial to my health, and it is probable that the welcome relaxation fitted me for duties which I fear might other- wise have been but sluggishly performed. A happy heart would have made my life very pleas- ant at Glen-Beck, for scarce a day passed that brought no token of the unflagging kindness   Oo 44KA TE-EzICE MANVERS-yEA4OoUSY,      of my two particular good spirits, Walworth and Mildred. Never was governess less the jaded, ill-treated creature she has so often been described. My pupils, it is true, had the usual faults of children, and the responsibility whichl met me on the threshold of my new life gave me some apprehension at first; but a rational and firm discipline obtained for me power over i their childish passions, and a judicious arrange- ment of the hours of recitation made the time passed in the school-room pleasant to them often; very wearisome, never. After a time both teacher and pupils considered it anything but irksome to be confined during stated hours f to the school-room. Even Frank's arithmetic was no longer a  dreaded book to him; and'  Lillian, who had from the first shown' an ex-  ceeding dislike to her geographical exercises, became very fond of them, after Walworth one  I evening, at my entreaty, traced with her his' tour through its different countrie% on the map of'Europe. The only really wearing hour in the day to me was that in which I   heard Tommy recite his French lesson.

His pronunciation was- false and labored,- his comprehension of the rules difficult, and there seemed little likelihood that he would ever become even passably ac- quainted with the language.  But this soon ceased to give me any annoyance. "What right had I," I asked myself, " to expect per- fectiont in my pupils ? "  Surely, my path had been made wonderfully smooth and even to unaccustomed feet. 'Mildred, with whom Kate became a favorite from the first, left us to spend our holiday to- gether.  With a delicate forethought she per- suaded her mother to relinquish her intention of asking us into the drawing-room, rightly. guessing that many of their gay visitors were summer friends of our own, whom it would under existing circumstances have been un- pleasant to meet. So Kate and I spent the day in my own. apartment, or in walking about the grounds. The sight of the well-known furniture in my room caused a burst of tears on Kate's part, but they were soon dried.    Possessing a    -   -- ,           . III . rt,..-- .

How short the day seemed. Letters from the West were exchanged and read, and fre- quent, yet not often, sad reference made to our former home and other- days. ,Kate, occu- pied and interested by her studies, and anxious to do well for our parents and my sake as well as her own, knew only the pleasant side of a. picture that I trusted would never become dark to her. "Bright Katie," my father had named her; and truly, wherever she came a new and grateful light. seemed to enter and abide. Gentle Katie, I called her this day; for there was an unusual caressing tenderness in her manner I. found it difficult to account for until she said, "If you were not so pale, Bessie! Are the children troublesome? '"' I took some pains to assure her that I could not expect better scholars or kinder treatment. My position at Glen-Beck I affirmed was not that of a teacher, but of a beloved and honored   KAT.-ELLICE :MANVERS-JEALOUSY. I07 friend. She appeared satisfied, but through allthe time of her stay I was subject to an affectionate scrutiny I could not escape. The day was wearing on, and a question I longed to ask Kate had not yet passed my lips. At length, with an effort at indifference, Isaid, "(Have you seen Larry, Kate?" "No, sister."    She clos 'd her lips and the bright b 1od flowed rosy to her cheek. She awaitedfurther questioning from me. "Well, Kate? I said, and my heart beat painfully. "He writes to a young lady at Madame Merillat's."   I  A stolid calm took possession of me. The needle I held in my hand pierced the piece of work deftly and well. "Is she one'of your friends, Kate?"  asked.       - She had not before looked at me, 'but sat with her gaze, fixed upon the'view outside the window, near which we were seated. Now, she turned quite round, and scanned my face. Its quiet expression probably reassured her.  I    108 KATE-ELLICE MANVERS-JEALOUS Y. "Ellice Manvers is my dearest friend," she replied. "She is a good, brave girl, whom one cannot but love.,'  "And she loves him, Kate?" - She put her arms tenderly about me. '"Bessie, I did not' say they were lovers. Ellice, told me that Lawrence wrote her, by Madame's permission. That is all I know. Ellice does not blush or look annoyed, when the girls tease her about her correspondent, and Madame says they are like brother and sister. " There was a pause. At length, ashamed of a feeling that made it almost impossible to * speak her name, I said: You. said Ellice was your dearest friend, Kate.  Are you very intimate?"  7 Yes, indeed," she returned, ( although I thought at one time we could never be more than acquaintances.

She had a gift for commencing at the very beginning of things, and told a  story in an entertaining -     * ! - :'!'.   '+   KA TE-ELLICE MANVYRS--7ALOUS Y.   I 09 manner and well. Having ascertained that it lacked yet an hour of the time Madame Meril- -lat expected her to leave Glen-Beck, she began: "Ellice Manvers and I met as new pupils the same day in the drawing-room at Madame ' Merillat's. Introduced to each other the first hour of our arrival, we were to share the same room, were seated next each other in most of our classes, and yet a fortnight went by and we were as great strangers to each other as on the day of our first meeting. Ellice, a noble- looking girl, tall and finely formed, had a face which, though not regular in its features, pos- sessed an indescribable beauty of expression. Yet mingled with this there were a- pride and reserve that I think contributed not a little to the want of sympathy between us during that first fortnight of our acquaintance. I, -with my warm heart just from home and its beloved ones, was prepared to bestow some of its affection, which had now no immediate ob- ject, upon those with whom I was to be more nearly connected in my new life at school. But  -Ellice's manner chilled me, and so I concealed : ^- 8                 I r- -   I O KATE-ELLCE MAN ERS-- EALOUSY. Y the regard which I had pre-determined should be bestowed upon my companion ; for her noble bearing caught my fancy, and I felt sure she was worthy of all the love I had to give. As the days- passed, I reluctantly resigned myself to the conviction that Ellice and I could never become near friends. Habit and daily cour- tesies exchanged made us seem cordial, but we rarely got beyond an expression of interest in each other. We had met as strangers; we would part little else, lthought, though friends in seeming. But I was mistaken. I had not yet learnt the way to my room-mate's heart. "Ellice Manvers had a sister, a child just entering her teens, beautiful, but very fragile, though, of a gay and sportive nature not often found in creatures so delicately formed. That little Edith was the object of Ellice's more than; sisterly care, was plain to the. commonest ob- server; but of the deep and almost passionate love with which she regarded her, I believe none but I was aware. I had watched her with no slight degree of interest, for I admired Ellice, though not yet allowed to love her; and in the eager eye following the fairy form, the   KA TE--ELLICE MANVERS-yEALO US Y.  I I  tender tones when addressing her, and above all the care and tenderness like a mother's with which she nightly conversed and prayed with her, convinced me that hers was no common affection for the child. Edith slept in an apart- ment opening from a large one occupied by Ellice and- myself, and each night before retir- ing to rest Ellice visited a second time her sleeping sister. Her evening prayers were always said kneeling at the little slumberer's couch, and I often looked at the picture the two others made, with a- secret half-loving,  admiration. "The usual routine into which we fell upon first entering school continued for some time without interruption. Ellice treated me with' an habitual politeness of manner differing little from the reserved -demeanor with which she mingled with her other companions, who re- garded her generally with a cold courtesy or well-bred indifference. I do not think had Ellice been removed from among us thjen,we would any of us have expressed even a regret. Edith,' with her airy beauty and gayety, was a general favorite; but: no one seemed inclined    II  KA iTE--ELLICE MANVERS-yEAX OM USY.  \ to bestow any of the attention she received  upon her reserved and, we all judged, haughty, i exclusive sister. Towards' the conclusion of i our first fortnight at school, however, an occur-  rence, rare, in our well-governed and quiet  instibtution, startled the Northern pupils into? a respect and attention to Ellice, while the South-  ern ones opened their dark eyes in a kind of indolent surprise. We were sitting in class; a long and tedious recitation had just been commenced, when word was brought that little Edith Manvers was seized with a sudden ill-   ness, and by the physician's order had been removed to her room. The attendant further  added that Madame required Miss Manvers presence as, soon as possible. Miss Seymour, our dignified and stern -monitress, said collec- tedly to the messenger, 'You should have delayed this information until the class was  dismissed. Miss Manvers may go to her sis- ter when the recitation is ended. The child is doubtless in very good hands.' And presum- ing -her decision to be .unquestioned, Miss Seymour proceeded with her examination. {" For one moment the hands laid, upon the   A4TE--ELLICE MANVERS-YEALOUSY.   113 book in Ellice's lap met in a tight clasp; the next, the book fell to the floor, and she stood erect and resolute before the lady. "Miss Seymour will be kind enough to allow me to go immediately to my sister.' " Her tone and look were almost those of command, although her eyes' haughty glance was belied by the quivering of her lip, which even her stern pride could not wholly subdue. Miss Seymour looked up at the speaker in sur- prise, then merely bowed her head in token of assent, and Ellice with a swift step left the room. " After school duties were over I sought Madame Merillat in order to ask permission to assist Ellice in watching beside her sister, and while I waited in an ante-room I accidentally overheard the physician who was with Madame say to /her, ' Rest assured I shall do all that lies in my power; but duty compels me to inform you that never, in long years of prac- tice, have I known an instance of a patient, young and delicate as Miss Manvers' sister, recovering from so violent and prostrating a fever as this gives token of becoming. If     I I4  TE--LLICE MAVERS-   AL O US Y. thlere was any'.strength of constitution to depend upon-'  "But I listened for no more. I gained the now deserted school-room, seated myself at my desk, and thought of Ellice, and' an over- whelming feeling of grief and pity filled mny heart. I had watched her in seeret so well, discovering in my scrutiny beautiful traits in her character, beside her great love for Edith, that in a degree I overlooked her repellent manner, and while I admired, longed to be permitted to love her also. Now, although I shuddered at the prospect of death  takingfTromn among us one so generally beloved as, Edith,  m ind dwelt most upon Ellice. Who could comfort her? I had learned from - one of the teachers that she and Edith were orphans. If-for the physician's words seemed to me prophetic--Edith indeed were taken, what a desolation life would be to Ellice. "Voices and approaching footsteps- roused me, and seeking Madame Merillat, I obtained permission to' assist Ellice in watching beside Edith's sick-bed. On reaching our, room I found Ellice with. her 'face buried in her   KA TE--ELLICE MANVERS--JEALOUSY. I5 liands, kneeling beside her sister's couch. She either did not hear or heed my entrance, and as I remained  unnoticed near her, I longed inexpressibly to be able to speak some words of comfort, but the recollection of whatI had overheard the physician say prevented me. Edith was indeed seriously ill, and that Ellice was 'aware of this I knew, for she raised; her head often and looked anxiously at her, speak- ing, as she did so, tender and soothing words to the little sufferer. At length she perceived me, and bowed with a faint smile of greeting. I approached and said in a low, earnest tone, 'I hope, Miss 'Manvers, you will not object to my sharing in your watch.' { For an instant she looked surprised; the, next, her hand was held out and met mine in a warm clasp, From that moment,.Bessie, I date our friendship.  "Night- after night Ellice and I watched together. Restlessly tossing or moaning'with pain and thirst, Edith was insensible to even her sister's tender words..

Its expression of utter misery wrung forth tears which I hurriedly concealed, lest, perceiving them, she should imagine me weep- ing over some alarming change in Edith. A week passed and the fair child grew no better. Our one prayer, that" blessed  Sleep might come, became hourly more desponding. The weary ache at our hearts grew worse as we looked in the physician's face each day in vain for a ray of hope, until at length Ellice herself ceased to watch for his step, but quietly gave place to him as he approached her sister's couch.  It was evident she had relinquished all hope,/ and her worn appearance, as she stood or sat down  in her silent, despairing attendance upon--the  sick-bed, alarmed all who saw her. At   length, one evening, in taking a  step or two from Edith's couch, she staggered and would have fallen had I  not g sprung to her assistancea I led her to a sofa, lying upon which she could look at Edith, and compelling her to lie down,a I went to the table for a  glass of water.

I had int my room a; sleeping potion that mother had given me in case I should again be a sufferer from neuralgic pain, and I determined to administer some to Ellice. Procuring it without exciting her sus- picion, I poured a few drops ihto the already half-filled glass of water, and approaching, offered it to her. She drank it without a question, and ere half an hour had elapsed I had the satisfaction of seeing her laid in a tranquil slumber, forgetful for a time, at least, of her wearing trouble and anxiety. I "Almost happy in -my lonely watch-, 1 gave Edith the medicine for the hour, bathed her temples with a cooling -liquid, -and fancying that she was inclined to sleep, though I scarcely dared hope this, I left her couch, and placing the lamp where its rays could reach neither sister, I sat'down to study for some of the morrow's recitations; resolute to bend my whole attention for,a short space upon my books, that I might know none of the suspense a constant watch at Edith's :ouch would cause  me to undergo. Thus- engaged, an hour passed unheeded away. t     ,   Il8 KATE  ELZICE MA4NVERS--yEA4LOUS Y. The sound of the nearest church-clock ringing  out its clear, full tones on the tnidnight air roused me, and I became aware of a hush throughout the room. Stealing with unshod I feet to Edith's bedside, my eyes were blest , with the sight of that for which so many prayers had been offered, we had thought, in vain. The worn child slept. I laid my hand upon her brow; it:was no longer hot'with the fever fire, and her respiration was regular and deep. With voiceless words of thanksgiving on my lips, I returned to my studies. "Day was dawning when I again arose, and looked at Edith. Still she slept, and with happiness in my heart I turned to Ellice. She slightly stirred as I looked, and fearing to allow this slumber to continue since I had given her that which caused it, I bent down and pressed her lips with mine. She turned, sighed wearily, and then opened wide her ex- pressive eyes in mute bewilderment. Stooping towards her Htold her in a whisper the joyful tidings.

When upon my knees, with petitioning words upon my lips, there con- stantly recurred to me the recollection of a picture, which the administration of an opiate 6 122 KA TE--ELLICE MANVERS---7EAL O US Y. had once wrought in mybrain. I remembered it well. 'In the centre of a vast plain, I saw a cross stand, high, massive, and bearing, the carved figure of'our Saviour. Above it the ' sky spread ashen and cold; around, upon the I edges of the horizon, golden and crimson, clouds betokened set of sun, and yellow rays fell across the plain and upon the cross with an indescribable effect. As far as sight could reach, the cheerless expanse of level surface spread in every direction, unrelieved by hill or. tree, and there was nothing for the eye to rest upon save the cross, and at the foot of it a prostrate human figure, which, prone as it had first fallen in some wild paroxysm of woe, so remained. - 'I was like that wretched one. Trembling limbs might bear me to the cross, but I had' neither sight nor strength for the-upward gaze, for clasped hands and beseeching cries for aid.    CHAPTER VII. A CHAPTER OF INCIDENTS.

Walworth glanced at his father, whose brow was unusually dark and gloomy, with a keen look before he answered him; then merely   124  A CHAPTER OF I1NCIDEXTS.  giving him an assurance that his wish. should be attended to, he reached across the table and took up the paper which lay beside -Mrs. -For- rester's plate. He looked carelessly over the :  columns, and seemed: about to refold and return it, when suddenly I observed his face flush and his brow -contract.

A "Nothing, Milly, that can reach or trouble ; you," he replied; and he smiled gently and affectionately upon her as he returned the paper to his mother's side. But I was informed of the cause of Wal- worth's emotion.  Very early in the morning I had risen with a  violent headache which I hoped to alleviate by a  walk in the garden; for-its dewy fragrance at this hour tempted me, and I found a charm in the quiet which reigned amid the walks,  broken only by the fountain's fall and the twit- ter of the young birds in their nests.

A CHAPTER OF INCIDENTS.    125 walk in the air refreshed me, although my headache was not removed, and on my return to the house I gathered a few choice blossoms, and .arranging them with care entered the dining-room, to lay them beside Mildred's plate. Near that of Mr. Forrester, Poulett had placed, as was his custom, yesterday's journals; for the daily papers were.- never brought until the evening, although Mr. For- rester frequently drove to and from the city twice in the course-of the day. Taking up one of these journals I chanced upon an article that must have touched by its sarcasm, and pierced by its- home-thrusts, the soul- of the master of Glen-Beck. For some time past the daily papers had been allowed, to lie about with impunity, for the affair of the failure of the Talbot Bank, after having caused the usual nine days' wonder, seemed to have been in- definitely dropped. But something giving cause for the renewal of the subject of fraudu- lent Banking,; there appeared forthwith a cut- ting article bringing up old accusations against the parties implicated in the failure of the Tal- bot Bank, and ended by denying to-them an   I26  A CHAPTER OF INCIDENTS.         honorable position in society. It was written in a very bitter spirit, but its arguments couldrX not be gainsaid. -I did not wonder at Mr.' X Forrester's gloom, or at the signs in -Wal-  worth's face, of anger and perhaps pain.  Walworth fell into a fit of silent musing,  i which lasted some time.' I was looking at him  A  with sad scrutiny when he suddenly raised his- eyes, and perceiving that Poulett was about to remove my untouched-plate at my desire, said with an air of concern,  "Miss Wilmerton, how is- this? You do not eat, and I observe that you look pale and ill."                 ' ' I said I;had a headache. "Really, Miss Wilmerton," said Mrs. For- i rester kindly, "I did not observe your want of appetite. If you canniot drink your coffee, let me send for some tea and biscuit. A cup -of strong tea will often remove headache."'  I shook my head, for I loathed inexpressibly the thought of nourishment of any kind. ' "Do be persuaded to try something,"  Mildred urged affectionately, and Mrs. For-    i rester ordered the tea to be brought. .   CrHA PTER OF INCIDENTS.

Accompanied by Mildred and the children,I enjoyed greatly the sail upon the Wissitere, and the view of the wooded banks on either side. Walworth was assisted in rowing by Donald Ray, the gardener's son, a stout boy of fifteen, and who sang, at Mildred's bidding, some simple Scotch songs he had learned from his mother. He had a good voice, and when Mildred- accompanied him in one or two ballads which had been also taught her by Mrs. Ray, the effect was very fine, possessing as it did all the charm of an impromptu per- formance.    128  A CHAPTER OF; IVNCDENTS.         "The children, soon -grew tired of the singing however, and teased Walworth to tell them a story, "about mermaids i" the element we floated upon, it is probable, suggesting the subject. Walworth professed utter ignorance of the existenceof any such creatures. But you drew a mermaid for me once brother Walworth; so you must know some- thing about it,"' exclaimed Lillian, triumph- antly. Walworth shrugged his shoulder s "It- must have been a water-spirit," he returned. "I know nothing of mermaids. " "Did it'have long hair, Lillian, and a tail?" asked Tommy. * "It was in the water, :and I could not see," replied Lillian. "Do mermaids have tails, 'Mily?" she questioned, looking upat her sis- ter with eager curiosity. "Yes indeed, Lillette," replied Mildred, kissing the s weet upturned face. "They have I tails I ike that of a fish, scaly and shining, and they possess very sweet voices also; and they sing and sing, until unwary mariners are lured ;arines are lu red'       A CHAPTER OF INCIDENTS.

But the waves cover them, and they are seen no more,"- "What becomes of the poor men?" asked Frank, earnestly. "They lie drowned at the bottom of the sea," answered Tommy, who understood Mil- dred better than the others. "Tell us more about mermaids, Milly," entreated Lillian. "Mildred," I interposed, "is it quite wise in you, to tell the children these things?" She smiled, and, was about to excuse what was only thoughtlessness on her part, when Walworth exclaimed, "Wait a moment, all of you, and- will show you a bond-fide water- spirit." And he commenced turning the boat slowly towards the shore.    , The course of the river being through a mountainous/ district, its bed was filled with rocks, some of which appeared in places above the surface of the water; forming tiny islets; while others were just covered by the flowing current, rendering it dangerous for a person  !130  X CHAPTER OF INCIDENTS. unacquainted with this fact to venture upon the river. Walworth, however, knew, how to ^ avoid the dangers hidden from sight. He now impelled the boat to within twenty feet of the  shore, and directed our attention to a broad rock which spread, just under thie surface of the water, some three or four feet. "You shall be our water-spirit, Lillian," he said. And taking h:r up in his arms, he placed her upon- the rock, and held her-until she promised him to stand quietly while he rowed away a short distance, to allow us to look at her.  "The effect will be fine," he said, " if she can be persuaded to stand fearlessly for a mo- ment. There is no danger." His influence over Lillian was so great that she' would have cast herself into the water. at his command. Now'.she closed her lips firmly, while Mildred, taking her hands, crossed them upon her breast, to enable her to -stand more steadily. The water barely reached over the sole of each shoe., Walworth rowed away to a short distance. A spirit indeed Lillian looked. She seemed -   A CHAPTER OF INC IDENTS.   131 to stand upon the water, which flowed round her with a light, rippling motion Her slight figure, clothed in white, contrasted well with the green background of the wooded shore, while a light breeze lifted and swept back the long, golden curls from her face. Something --the flight of a bird, perchance-attracted her eyes towards a hill. on the opposite shore, and the upturned gaze and hands crossed upon her bosom gave her the appearance, indeed, of a river-haunting divinity, enabled, by more than mortal power, to remain secure upon the unstable element. We gazed at her breathless, and when Wal- worth approached, and lifted her again into the boat, Mildred received her in her- arms, with kisses and words of fond praise; for her self-possession. We had been moved almost to tears by the sight, for Lillian seemed in some way not of us when standing there, and to touch her once more was to assure ourselves of her flesh and blood reality. "Mildred," said Walworth as we floated out again into the current, " sing for us the old  song-,'Flow gently, sweet Afton.' One ' ": ',       I *    H   1 132 4A CHAPTER OF INCIDENTS.  never tires of the simple air. And as her clear, pure tones floated over the water, ming- ling with its ripple and the dash of the oars, I observed him look at her, while a peculiar, sad i smile flitted over his face. To-day he had lost, much of his usual impatient, proud look, and he seemed to take a tender pleasure in  every word and act of Mildredis. Inexpressi- . bly dear Iknew she was to him, and I had long suspected that he watched with a kind of jealous feeling the growing friendship between his sister and Dana Poinsett, and one day I I could not but smile at its involuntary exhibi- tion.  "Are Dana Poinsett's German books less    I difficult of translation than mine?" he aske4, half austerely, as he observed that she was rendering  into  English "Des Maidchens Klage," from Mr. Poinsett's volume of Schill- er s  Ballads, while his, a much finer copy and printed in better type, lay untouched upon the Shelf. Mildred colored deeply and, looked ex- tremely pained, but she answered gently, - "No, Walworth."    . '  EIIIIN . ' -" , ' . .......... d '   A CHAPTER OF ZNCIDENTS.    I33 He looked at her for a moment, and a quick keen light glittered in his eye. From that  time, I observed that Dana Poinsett and she were the objects of his careful though con- cealed observation. When Mildred's song was finished, Wal- worth sent the children home with Donald, by a path which led from  the water's edge around a hill and through fields to Glen-Beck. He then proposed that we should cross the river, and landing on the other- shore, ascend a -hilly slope, which rose gradually to some height from the river bank; for the prospect from the top of it, he affirmed, would well re- pay us for a little fatigue in reaching it.  We ascended the hill, which was called " The Lady's Seat," and exclaimed with delight at the view which met our gaze.. The hills of this mountainous district here formed a circle, and enclosed, lying at, their base, appeared a secluded and most picturesque landscape, Like giant guardians, these Ihills seemed to protect a beauty' which slept in tranquil peace' below. Their slopes and the valley were clothed in that peculiar fresh- green, ^  ^ ^^^^^^^^^'^^^^ *- - r     4 11 --I.   134  A CHAPTER OF INCZDENTS. which is so soon lost in the faded and parched midsummer verdure. . Trees were abundant, and remarkable for graceful growth, and height, but they did not crowd the picture. A tributary stream of the Wissitere wound a glittering way beside pleasant dwellings and X through groves, where we caught only now and then a sparkle from its current, until it emerged again into the s'unlight, witlh a new glisten on each tiny wave. Overhead the sky was cloudless, and a refreshing air dame waft-' ing over the tcIps of the hills.  Near the p int where we stood, a railroad had been made, or rather cut t'hrough the side ofTthe hill, which rose precipitous on either hand, for the opening through the rocks was only wide enough to admit of going and- re- turning cars on their respective railways. A carriage road,- too, wound up and down among, the hills, and crossing the car-track entered the valley., Seated on this-hill we remained sight-bound for a space.              .   . "Why is this mount called 'The Lady's Seat?  presently inquired Mildred.  xei..   A CHAPTER OF ITNCIDENTS.    I 3 5 i"It received the name wihtn the States were yet called British Colonies, and it has re- tained it ever since,"Walworth replied. v"There is a story attached to it?" inquir- ingly asserted Mildred. -"Yes,!' returned h'er brother gazing absently over the landscape. He was evidently trying to recall it. We waited quietly. "I shall not be able," he soon commenced, "to tell the story as it was told to me, for Dana Poinsett was the narrator; but I will en- deavor simply to relate a -few facts, that you may understand what gave the place. its name. "About' the time of, or shortly before, the Declaration of Independence by Congress,when the country was- filled with opposing parties, and then men talked of the tumult and horror, of an existing conflict, Mrs. Winstahley, a lady of good birth and some fortune, came with her son, a youth of eighteen, to reside in one of the small farm-houses of yonder peaceful valley, Her husband, by birth a subject of the crown, had warmly espoused the cause of the op- pressed colonies, and engaged in the active    136  A CHAPTER OF INCIrDzT S    .   :  I  preparations for war making on every hand. Freedom's battle-cry was echoing from all our 1 hills, and it was with difficulty that Mrs. Willn-  Stanley persuaded her son to remain-at her   '  side, during a period when every patriot pulse beat fast at the story of Britain's wrong to hker i! feeble offspring, just struggling for life, amid danger and privation, on a savage shore. "Battle-fields reddened theland. Fromcities - and towns, to the so'itary house of the 'hardy settler in the wilderness, no place was secure . from  rapine and bloodshed. Young Arthur Winstanley walked restlessly among the hills, or sat at his mother's side in gloom. She'  looked at him with sad unrest, but could not endure the thought of his leaving her-for the scene of strife, although his entreaties to be I; allowed to join his father became daily. more difficult to resist.        ^ "At length, one day a band of soldiers, marching to the sound of mournful music, bore  i. he --dead body of Major Winstanley to the. louse- of his widow.

'After a time, she arose with a strange strength, and. those who looked upon .her were amazed at the great'calmness visible in her -face. Unfastening the sword from the belt of his father's corpse, she placed it in the hands of her son, and led him forth to the soldiers, who were gathered in a group out- side the house. ' Soldiers, ye see whatIdo,' she said. ' My country hath' now all that I have to give.'s And pressing one long kiss on .the forehead of her boy, she left him with the men, and returned to her dead. " After the funeral of her husband, it became Mrs. Winstanley's custom to ascend this hill in the early morning, and seating herself, re- main often till darkness compelled her to go back to her desolate home.   No summer's heat or winter's cold prevented her going, although they might hasten her return. They said she was watching for her son. But he never came. The road to- which her weary eyes were so often turned irn waiting hople, was not again to be pressed by his returning feet, or even trodden by those who might have come to witness his burial.  He died on a   1.38  A CHAPTER OF INCIDENTS. distant battle-ground, and soon after his death they laid her beside her husband. "At this day, there are yet those in the village who remember the sorrow-stricken woman, whose daily habit gave this place its- name; aged and decrepid men and women, whose feet are tottering on the verge of the grave, but 'with energy  still sufficient to describe the occupant of The Lady's Seat."l The silence that followed Walworth's recital was broken by an exclamation from Mildred. "See! brother, is not that Dana Poinsett's horse, and I am sure that Dana himself is cne of .the gentlemen in the chaise." Walworth rose and joined Mildred,: who had removed to a little distance, in order to obtain a Abetter view of the light vehicle which was advancing down the road.  I was in the act of tying together a few wild-flowers, which I had gathered as we ascended the hill, when the air, ' frshening into a  breeze, lifted my handker- chief, the terial of which was light and fine, and carrying it down the hill, deposited it on the railway below.

Seeing in a moment how this could be done, I ran down the slope, gained the road, and was soon upon the ca'-track, searching for the missing handkerchief. Not finding it, I advanced some distance, Icoking on this side and that, in vain, when a sound that I trust I may never hear again, with lthe same feeling. of terrified despair, met my ear. Itwas the warning whistle of the cars. Loud it rang and near. Confused and affrighted, I knew not whether to advance or retreat, for the cars were not yet visible, and the road turned to the right a short distance in front of me. I looked up and around, but precipices on every hand hemmed me in.   Mildred, from, the height above, gesticulated wildly, anid I saw her lips move, but heard no sound. I flew first upon one 'track and then upon the other. The approaching roar and shriek of the engine appalled me. I was beginning to grow dizzy and faint, and to stagger to and fro like an inebriate, when I saw Lawrence Esterlyn bounding madly down the steep and danger- ous sides of the precipice. A new terror    "O  A CHAPTER OF INCIAENTS. seized me. He would be dashed lifeless at my very feet. Shrieking, I closed my eyes. A. moment after, I was seized and whirled upon the Other car-track. The locomotive whizzed by, and was gone. Lawrence held me closely in his arms. - "Oh, God! Bessie, my own own darling " he said. He kissed cheek and brow in a mad rapture, and murmured fast, endearing names, as he strained me in a close pressure to his breast. At once I was well and content. Strength supported me, love caressed me, I was blest; repaid- in that short instant, for the weeks and months of unexplained coldness and neglect. i remembermno more until my eyes opened up n the walls of my own room at Glen-Beck. There was a dizzy pain in' my head, and I could not at first: understand why anxious faces were bending over me, as I lay prone upon a couch; nor why Mildred kissed me tenderly,.as she bathed my forehead with some;s perfumed water.        - "Dearest Bessie!" she said, as I unclosed my eyes.    A CHAPTER OF INCIDENTS.    I4I "Hush! Miss Milly!" whispered Nurse Grey, who stood at 'my bedside with Mrs. Forrester. "Do not disturb Miss Wilmerton. Let her lie at peace." At peace I was. Though I suffered from headache and a sense of weakness in every limb, a great calm fell upon my spirit as recol- lection returned., I had seen Lawrence Ester- lyn, and knew, nay felt, that .he loved me. And what could trouble me henceforth? The pained and heavy lids dropped down again over my eyes, and laid in the very lap of happiness. I slept the sleep of the blest. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^^^^^^^    ,    ' .    CHAPTER VIII., HOPE AND PEACE--MLDRED'S SUITORS. "But spanning all that troubled sky, The Bow of Promise shines on high." ANNE C.

But now Hope was borne again out of the event of the preceding day, and courage en- tered anew into my heart. Content I was, oh, very patient and trustful. "Some mys- tery," I said to myself, "keeps Lawrence absent and silent. I will await his explana- tion ; I will bide his time. In his eyes- I have read constancy; in his kiss discovered tender- est feeling; in his embrace felt passionate and sustaining love. Never more will I doubt him. - Never again shall jealous pangs goad me to despair." The day passed like a pleasant-dream. At dinner Walworth had looked twice' or thrice across the table at me with a peculiar smile, and when the dessert was placed on the table, and the servants were no longer 'in attendance, he commenced mischievously: "So-daring an act as was Esterlyn's yester- day, deserves not to be passed over in silence." He took, as he spoke, a smallipaper from his pocket, which proved to be the- little, village chronicle, and handing it to Mildred, skid,   "4.    HOPE 4,N-D PEA CE.

There was a merry sparkle in his dark eyes, and I felt relieved when Mildred, who had been glancing over the columns of the paper she held in her hand, interrupted him as he was about to -continue.     A "Oh papa!" she exclaimed,   "the Kel- loggs' country-seat is for sale, and they gave up their town-house some months ago. They must be very much reduced. Did not Mr. Kellogg lose, as director, a great deal of money atthe failure of the Talbot Bank?"  "Yes," returned Mr. Forrester, briefly.   A 146    HOPEs AND PEACEC. '  "Indeed," exclaimed Walworth in an al- tered tone. ( I was not aware of this." "Julia Kellogg told me last spring," Mildred , went on, "that her father feared he would noti be able to keep Oaklands, and now they must go. Poor Julia! 'it will be a great trial to leave the old place." "Walworth," said Mr. Forrester, "Mr.. Kellogg will doubtless sell his fine collection of pictures. I have laid aside a sum-for their purchase. You had better mark those you wish sent to the town-house, and pay for them on the spot." So saying, Mr. Forrester took a roll of bank-notes from his pocket-book and laid them beside his son's plate. !.-  A' slight expression of abhorrent disgust crossed Walworth's face, very disagreeable to behold. It passed in a, moment, and he said quietly,  "Mildred will take charge of this, sir. I heard Mr. Poinsett say he was to accompany my mother and her to town to-morrow.

Pray, how much did the L  Society offer you for your last essay on Historical Painting?" -Waiworth looked at ,his mother in evident surprise. "Two  hundred  dollars," he answered, "which I accepted. But why do you ask?" "Oh, partly from curiosity," she returned. "Mr. Poinsett said yesterday, that he hoped you-had not taken less than five hundred dollars for it, since he knew the Society were likely to realize a large sum by its publication.": Walworth looked'supremely indifferent. "In that case, Bessie," said Mildred, " you will' be able to read the published essay. I Was about to ask Walworth to give you the manuscript for perusal." "Do you desire it, Miss Wilmerton"?"WaI- worth asked, looking at me. I said that certainly I hoped to be allowed to read it.   I48     HOPE AND PEACE. "-It is at your service," he replied; "Mildred shall hand it to you this evening." -The essay was a fine and enthusiastic de- fence of "High Art," as a painter would term it. Walworth argued' that each country should have its history skilfully painted on the walls of its council chambers'; that men would be incited to great deeds by the pictured his- tory of noble acts, and led to shun evil ones by a like display of the criminal commissions of foregone generations. After a rational and eloquent discussion of the subject, he wound, up with an ;appeal that must have stirred to ambition, nay, roused to actual effoft, every thinking man into whose hands the essay might fall. Mildred was justly proud of it, and gratified as I was by its perusal, I did not refrain from speaking highly in its commehda- tion when I returned it to Walworth. He looked at me with the saddest expres- sion in his eye.  "'And what boots it all?" he said. " If I wrote with never so fine an eloquence, Bessie, how would it avail me?" ' He seldom called me Bessie. I was touched + -   * *, t-  ,   , ' 'i   HOPE AND PEACE.     1 I49 and puzzled, for I was 'interested in,- and liked I him.       . "Why,"  I ,returned after a moment's bought, '.'your essay will doubtless effect a great change in many persons' views of this matter. If you', and others like you, write thus eloquently and well, on this and similar subjects, what enlightenment may not follow? In time great,'good will accrue from these efforts." "'And in the meantime those who make these efforts?" he interrogated. ; " May die, "I replied; "but their works shall honor them living or dead.': "Ah!" he said. "I am reminded of an il- lustration a German student once employed in a conversation, with me. We were upon this very subject-Shall not a man make every effort for the well-being of his kind, even if personal happiness be denied him? Let me give his exposition: In the midst of a vast prison, a man sat 'in his cell and sang by day and by night. Hundreds of prisoners in the cells about his were cheered by the singing; yet they did not know, many of them, who    ;-    ;            r - 150    HOPE fAND PEA CE. the singer was. They only rejoiced in the melody, as it reached and penetrated their cells. This man differed from the majority of the' other prisoners ; he was arrayed in better garments, and his room was 'larger,. more airy, and lighter than many others. But all this was naught to him; for he- bore continually a burden it was not in his power to remove, though it weighed him to utter prostration at times, and he had no hand in placing it upon -himself. "' Once the thought of this burden caused him to cease in his song, and the inmates of the other cells missed the consoling voice. Did he do right to pause, Bessie? ," "No!-'I said. - "But his song did himself little good," Wal- worth urged, "No matter!"I decided. "It was right ' for him to sing on and on. I trust he did." The look in Walworth's face was painful-to behold. It was like a smile at doom.  "Theqre was a fair girl in this prison," he continued, "(whom- this man loved, and he would have asked her to share his cell with   HOPE AND PEACE.      15I him, but he knew that if she came, she must. bear the burden and accept of part of the suf- fering also.'- So the maiden never guessed - that he loved her, and the years passed, and he sang tirelessly on, until' one day there was silence where aye had been the song. The burdened singer was at rest." "And he now beholds the face of his Father and the glory thereof," I said softly, after a silence. "Surely, Walworth, this more than atones." Walworth turned away. Days and weeks fleeted by. Kate came and went-to Glen-Beck, and Ellice Manvers was talked of by her fond companion, until I imag- ined her a being almost ' "too good For human nature's daily food." And I was told of Lawrence Esterlyn's letters to Ellice, and even of her meeting him once byr preconcerted arrangement ill Madame Meril- lat's drawing-room, and yet the great calm which filled my whole being was undisturbed. I was not jealous of Ellice Manvers now. The   i 52    HOPE AND P ACE. knowledge tuat she corresponded with Law- rence, and met and conversed with him; was ' impotent to change the perfect trust I felt at heart.             , I wrote to my, mother of my danger and rescue. Perhaps I needlessly exaggerated the terrible fate I had escaped; it is probable that I dwelt unnecessarily at length upon the pres- ence of mind and courage of the rescuing hero ; but a happy love gave me words which burned along the page as I wrote, and mnust have shown vividly to her, how utterly my life was changed and gladdened into peace. Soon her answer came-congratulatory, but warning also. Very precious to a daughter are words of counsel from a mother's lips. , My joy was sobered into a temperate gladness; for her letter spoke of life as a probation state, that could never by-any possibility yield fruition on earth..  \ e By this time, Mildred and I were become firmly attached to each other. Nearly all the time not passed in the school-room I spent with her.

The affectionate girl had contrived to make many of my daily tasks lighter, and had shortened to five, the customary six hours I employed in instructing the children. And if Mildred manifested a lively interest in my welfare, her happiness was of moment  to me also. I looked out to her future, and trusted that it would be blest. The male visi- tors who came-to Glen-Beck underwent a close scrutiny from me. Many of them, young men of fashion and little principle, were her suitors only on account of the known wealth ....of her father. Others, companions, of Walworth, were good, some of them very learned men; but they did not reach the standard by which I wished to measure that man who-should call her bride and wife. There were two, however, Walworth's intimates, and habitual visitors at Glen-Beck, who nearly satisfied my jealous fancy. Though differing widely from each other, Colonel Aicheson and Dana Pdinsett were both worthy of Mildred, I decided. Would she marry either, was a question I often debated with myself. Colonel Aicheson, older by some years than t I . l   154   -  HOPE AND PEACE.  Mr. Poinsett, was a tall, soldierly-looking man, , and a great favorite with the family at Glen- Beck. He was generous and brave, having good intellectual endowments, and gifted with- a polished and fascinating address. He pos- sessed -a fine residence in the near neighbor- hood, for the remote grounds of Glen Beck bordered on some of the outlying fields of Elmwood, the name of the Colonel's place, and it was whispered- in society that neither Mr. nor Mrs. Forrester would object to, him for a son-in-law. . , That Colonel Aicheson loved Mildred, I was sure. Numberless times the conviction had been forced upon me, until I could doubt no longer. And that she was perfectly indifferent ;to him I was just as certain; for Mildred was not such a dissembler with me that I found it difficult to read her heart. At a very early  period in oir intimacy I had perused its pages at will, and it was likely that I was possessed of the, nowledge of her love for Dana Poinsett very long before she had confessed it to her- self. It could not be otherwise than that I, with my sex's quick instincts, by the eye which    HOPE. AND PEACE.     I 55 took a softer lustre, the cheek that gained a redder tinge, and her whole manner, which assumed, a more tender bearing at Mr. Poin- sett's entrance, should learn the secret that was swaying her whole being. ' And Dana Poinsett. -Of what nature was the regard he bore Mildred? It might be that of friend or brother, scarcely that of a lover, I had decided, and as often retracted the deci- sion. His demeanor toward her was that of a protecting elder brother. I never recollect him passionate or tender; and yet when the subject of Colonel Aicheson's attentions' to Mildred was discussed in the absence of the two, by the gay and thoughtless circle into which I was sometimes thrown, I have ob- served his color change, and a pained expres- sion rest upon his features. It was not jeal- ousy I thought; for Colonel Aicheson and he were the most united of friends, and if he did indeed love Mildred, he made no manifestation of regard to its object. I was puzzled, for I had noted also that Walworth had ceased in his observation of him, convinced apparently by his manner that he felt only an ordinary and   156     HOPE AND PEACE. natural interest in his sister, with whom he-had been acquainted fronm his boyish years. Colonel Aicheson's attentions -to Mildred seemed Snot to give Walworth a thought. Perhaps he saw, from the first, the utter indif- ferenice of her bearing toward him. { Mildred, would you Cbe In maiden meditation, fancy free?"' . he said playfully one day, as he observed her separate a white rose from a bouquet the Col- onel had just presented her, and carelessly place the remaining flowers in a vase .near. "Why not?" she returned.  "Man's in- constancy is like the changing moon. Better, --then, that one keeps one's self ' fancy free!'" '( It appears to me, Miss Forrester," said the Colonel, "that yours is a one-sided argument. Does your broad assertion, concerning, a per- haps well-known truth, admit of no exceptions? Surely, you will not deny wholly to the one sex that constancy which lends the greatest charm to the affection of the other?" Mildred took up a-book from a table beside   HOPE AND PEACE.      1 57 her, and read aloud from a marked passage to, which she opened easily:'  ' ' Man trusts in God; ok. He is eternal. Woman trusts in man, And he is shifting sand.' There is the evidence of one of your own sex," she said, " and he appears to speak from con- viction." Walworth's attention was demanded by one of his mother's visitors, and he crossed the room. The Colonel bent over and said some- thing in, a low voice to Mildred. She looked up in his face, and shook her head. "No, indeed!"I am perfectly inaccessible to proof on this subject,"' she exclaimed, ran smiling away to assist Lillian, who was at- tempting to place a heavy book of prints on the table, from whence it had been taken for her amusement. Dana Poinsett, who stood very near me, suppressed a sigh. "Certainly," I thought, "the interest of the play is deepening every hour. -.How will it be acted out?"   158    HOPE AND PEACE.  Just at this time I missed a daguerrotype likeness of myself, which I had intended for a birthday gift to Kate., At first I was per- suaded I had mislaid it, but after a thorough search I reluctantly came to-the conclusion that it had been taken from my drawing-room table, where I remembered to have laid it one even- ing when a' large party of gentlemen were present. The merits of several Daguerrian artists were, being discussed, and Mildred highly praised the likenesses of the man who had taken mine, which led to its production. So much I could recollect. What became of it remained a mystery. I knew that it was not- uncommon for thoughtless young gentlemen ; to appropriate a daguerrotype likeness if it lay in their way, considering it fair spoil, and I was vexed at the thought of mine being thus purloined. Mildred attempted to tease me a great deal about an" unknown and modest admirer," whose modesty, however, I inconti- nently denied. For a long time after my loss, I scanned the faces of Mildred's -gentlemen visitors, to discover, if possible, a conscious or- annoyed expression meeting my -close, half-     HOPE AND PEACE.      159 questioning gaze, but nothing resulted from the examination, and I was constrainefd to put the - best face on the matter with what grace I kmight.

BOUT    this time Mildred and I were in the habit of driving to the city, on the afternoons of pleasant days, where we- called upon  Kate,   made necessary   and  un- necessary   purchases, and   visited one or two painters' and sculptors' studios, which just then had   attraction for us.- The   artists were for-   THE DRESS-MAKER AND MLDRED. 16 I61 eigners, friends of Walworth's, and were en- gaged, the painter on a picture, the sculptor on a group, the progress of which we watched with increasing interest. One day towards sunset we were on our way back to Glen-Beck. In passing one of the pretty little cottages that border the high- road from M  for a considerable distance, Miidred desired the coachman to stop. "I must call and see how Mrs. Dalton is to- day," she explained to me. "Come, Bessie, you will be pleased to make her acquaintance, and she will excuse our unceremonious call." I objected on'the score of the strangeness of the proceeding. "Oh, Bessie," Mildred returned, "Mrs. Dalton wMas never much influenced by the conventional usages of society, and now she is likely to be less so than ever. She is ill of a consumption, and her physician, gives her no hope of living through'the autumn months. Bessie, I have frequently spoken to her of' you, and she expressed a desire to make your acquaintance when I called last with mamma." We proceeded up the little path that led to /. -   I62 STHE DRESS-MA4KER AND MLDRED. the cottage door. A  servant-woman came out to meet us.  "How is Mrs. Dalton to-day, Elizabeth?" Mildred asked. "My mistress died last night, Miss," an- swered the woman. Mildred's shocked face must have touched her. !"She went quite suddenly' at the last," she said, lifting -her apron to -her eyes, "but quietly, like one going to sleep." "And how is Mrs. Ellerton?"   Mildred questioned further, when she could speak. "She is but poorly since her daughter's death; but will you walk in while I inform her of your coming? " We ascended the steps and. went in. Soon the woman returned to ask Mildred upstairs. I seated myself in the, little parlor to await, Mildred's/return. When she came, she said: "We are to go back to town, Bessie. Mrs. Ellerton was much distressed at the thought of the -dress-maker's walking alone to the city at. this late hour, and I immediately offered her a seat in the carriage to relieve Mrs..Ellerton, I*    '   .        , -!

The dress-maker vas leaving it-as we entered. She had just dressed the dead for burial. A beautiful face lay turned toward, us as we advanced to the couch, and there was an ex- pression of perfect peace on the fine features that struck and touched me deeply. "I knew that she, would not long survive her husband and child," said Mildred, " but this is soon to go: Mr. Dalton has not been dead a year."  At this moment the dress-maker re-entered' the room, carrying some white flowers, with which she strewed the couch. "I like best to make shrouds," she said; "they are never brought back to be altered." And she went on smoothing out the folds of the white mering garment and laying a blos- som here and there upon the pillow. Her words made me shudder, and I looked at the girl. It was a pale, wan face that bent over the dead. Her speech was not a heartless   "THE DRESS-MAnER AND MLDRED. one. I felt that she had suffered, and was weary, perhaps, of ministering to the follies of fashionable women, whose dresses, doubtless, cost her a world of trouble to make in accord- ance with their capricious .whims. "Comet Miss Aymer;" said Mildred, quiet- ly, when the dress-maker's task was finished. "Get your bonnet and shawl, for it grows . late, and we-should be on our way." On our return to the city Mildred pointed out Oaklands to me. "Is it not sad," she said, "that Mr. 'Kel- logg must leave the old place? It has been in the family for three generations." "It must be a great trial indeed," I said. "Aye," here interposed Miss Aymer, " butt I would far rather be in Mr. Kellogg's place than in that of Mr. Forrester, cashier of the Talbot Bank."  "Why?'"   interrogated  Mildred, greatly astonished.    , "Because," she answered, "Mr. Kellogg was an honest director in the Bank, and the cashier was a rogue,-and when I call him thus, I give him the mildest name that he deserves." -              .   THE DRESS-MAKER AND MLDRED. 165 Mildred's face blanched. For a moment she looked sternly at the girl; but, ignorant of Mildred's name, as the girl evidently was, she could have intended no personal insult. There-was silence for a time, however, for Mildred could not immediately control her- self. Then, by a series of rapid questions, she learned the dress-maker's history, one that is only perhaps too common in cities where the simple, hard-working classes commit their little savings to the hands of unprincipled specula- tors whom no law can restrain. Occasionally a bitter expression concerning the cashier and some of the officers of the Talbot Bank escaped her, for much of her trouble had been caused by the failure of this bank, and I observed Mildred shrink as if a naked nerve had been touched.  Her father, Miss Aymar said, had been a mechanic, anrid had worked in the city of M   for twenty years. He had been enabled to lay by a little money in that time, with which he purchased stock in the Talbot Bank. His savings were enough to maintain himself and his family comfortably, in their frugal way -r ----c- ,^^.. :' /   m,. '   166 THE DRESS-MAKER AND MLDRED. of living. Not being in good health, he was advised by a, physician whom he consulted, to give up work, since constant employment- had undermined a naturally good constitution. But this he was ;unwilling to do, Miss Aymar said, for her mother, who was crippled by a fall, had been bedridden for years, and required many delicacies to tempt her failing appetite, which, did he cease his daily toil, he could no longer procure for her. So the feeble man worked on for a space, until the Talbot Bank failed. When he learned" that all his hard- earned savings were swallowed up in the gen- -eral wreck that ruined hundreds beside himself, he lost courage and hope, and sank to the grave under the gloomiest apprehensions con- cerning his faniily. Since her father's death her mother' had -fallen into partial idiocy, and, with. one brother and two sisters, depended' upon her alone for support. She would not be so bitter, she said, apolo- getically, as she looked at Mildred's face and. mine (for we both were excited by her strong expressions), but her 'father had been sorely wronged. Oh, there was little truth and hon-   THE DRESS-MAKER AND MLDRED. i67 esty in the world, she asserted. There -was a man, a, Mr. Meredith (a distant relation, she thought, of Mr. Forrester, the cashier -of the Talbot Bank), who had called himself her father's -friend for years. Though he was richer than her father-a man quite well off, indeed-yet having worked at the same trade with Mr. Aymar, in early life, a sort of attach- ment existed between them; and living in'the same neighborhood, scarce a day passed that they did not see each other. They sat at the same communion-table,held the same -political opinions, and in many points were as one man. : Mr. Meredith knew Mr. Aymar's circum- stances ;: knew that he had no resource, if his health failed, save the slowly gathered earnings vested in the stock of the Talbot Bank. Two years before its failure, when there were rumors afloat derogatory to the credit of the bank, Mr. Aymar purposed to sell his stock, even at a sacrifice. But his friend persuaded him to relinquish his design. The Bank was safe enough, he assured him, and he would not sell his own stock. Time passed. The friends met in-church and on week-days as usual..   168 THE DRESS-MAKER AND MLDRED. No premonitory warning- reached Mr. Aymar till the shock came. On the day of the failure, as Mr. Aymar was returning home, he mnet Mr. Meredith. ," This is a sad day to you and me," he said. Mr. Meredith questioned why, "Surely," said Mr. Aymar, " you are aware of the failure of the Talbot Bank.? You suffer a loss, but I am ruined-."   . "Oh!" returned Mr. -Meredith, "I shall not lose. Hsold my stock six months ago." Warned by his relative, the cashier, he had disposed of his stock without his friend's knowledge. Mr., Aymar said not a word, but went home, never again to leave it until they bore his cof-  fined form to the hearse. Truly, Miss Aymar had suffered.   We might not condemn her bitterness. - When the dress-maker was left at her 1odg- ing, Mildred desired Pierre to drive home as rapidly as he might with safety.' She sat back in the carriage, pale, arid with a sternness on her lip unusual to her. I did not make any fc-- *             -   THE DRESS-MAKER AND MLDRED. 169 remark, and she neither moved nor spoke until we reached Glen-Beck. Late in the evening, Mildred and I repaired to the drawing-room. Seated at the piano, Mildred played mournful and solemn airs. Not a cheerful note was struck by her fingers. Now and then she would pause and lean for- ward upon the instrument, her head upon her hands. Then the playing would go on again, softer and sadder than before. I felt -deeply for her. The dress-maker's history could not but have a serious effect upon her mind. "Alas!"I thought, II this is but the -beginning of a revelation that cannot fail to cast a shadow over her life, at least for a time. The sword, so long suspended by a single hair above her head, must fall, and soon. I dread the con- sequence.". Rising, I went outupon the moonlighted piazza, and looked over the balustrade upon the garden below, watching the fountains rise and fall in the white beams that silvered each waterldrop to a rare pearliness and soft glitter. Presently Walworth entered the drawingcroom, crossed it, and Joined me outside. For a time   I70 THE DRESS-MAKER AND MLDRED. no word was spoken, and although I had not looked at him after my first glance up as he ap-  proached, I could/ feel that his eye sought and rested upon me more than once, with a gaze of which I found it difficult to seem unconscious. "Do you like sad music, Bessie?" he said at length. - "Yes," I answered, "I like it. When - there are no unhappy-recollections to stir, such music has a peculiar charm." ;     i a"It awakens now for me' recollections that are not sad," he said. His eyes as he looked at me had a tender and kindly glance, but the old unquiet -look had not wholly forsaken them. "There are strange meetings and 'still stranger partings in this, world," was his next somewhat irrelevant remark. I was silent. "Eight months ago," he went on, " in a gay and brilliant assemblage, where masks were worn at will by merry guests, H myself masked-met a lady who struck and impressed me as I never had been impressed before. She wore no mask."   THE DRESS-MAKER AND MLDRED. I7i "Well?"I said inquiringly, for he had paused,and was looking earnestly in my face. "We held a conversation, this lady and I. iGifted she was, and I will not say how fair she l1ooked to me. In the midst of the crowded room, surrounded by giddy girls and inane and selfish men, we talked of Self-abnegation. Strange subject for the time and the occasion. The lady-was young, but she spoke eloquently and well. I inferred from her, words that the love of a right cause iWould, if there were need,  enable her to live a persecuted life, and die a martyr's death. Deeply interested, we .did not heed remark, or note the flight of time. The approach of some' of the lady's friends interrupted us, and we parted. Does the lady remember the conversation or her companion, think you?" The preceding winter I had met a masked gentleman in a gay company of, men and women, and had held a conversation on the subject named. I recalled it now as Walworth spoke. 'He, then, was my unknown companion. "Does the lady remember?" he repeated. "Yes," I said, "she remembers' now, but   72 THE DRESS-MAKER AND MLDRED. she had forgotten. Why, pray, did you never tell me this before, Walworth?" "I only wonder at my folly in telling it now)" he said, and a bitter smile crossed his E  face. I gazed at him in the greatest astonish- ment.  "What f611y could there possibly be, Wal- worth, in telling me that we had met before?" I Tasked. My hand lay upon the- carved wood of the balustrade.- He caught'it up suddenly in both his own, and carried it to his lips; then drop- ping it quickly as if the contact had, given him sharp'pain,.he turned from me, walked through the drawing-room, crossed the hall, and .spent the remainder of the evening in the library, with closed doors. After this, Walworth was reserved and under restraints with me for a time, but we soon resumed our old friendly intercourse, for I en-I tertained for him a true sisterly affection, and often strove to wile him from the sad thoughts which I saw were becoming habitual to him, and exerting a pernicious effect upon his ; bodily health.   THE DRESS-MARR AND MLDRED. I73  The next day' Mildred went down to the farm with me. According to my frequent custom, I filled my pockets with corn and graini received from Nurse Matty, and went to feed her pretty fowls that knew me by this time and flew to meet me when I entered the yard. The chickens fed, I took my way back to the house. As I approached, I saw Mrs. Grey sitting in-the porch, and Mildred kneeling beside her, with her face hidden-in her bosom. Presently she raised her head, and amid sobs and tears began a history that I could see was painful to both listener and narrator. Retreat- ing softly, I seated myself in a sort of arbor formed by the grape-vine trellis, and here remained until Mrs. Grey called to me from the house. When I joined her, she said Mil- dred did not seem very well, and she:had per- suaded her to lie down in an upper chamber. Would I partake of some luncheon she had prepared for me? I accepted the kindly offer, and the new milk being drank and the bread eaten, I left Nurse Matty, promising to return for Mildred at sunset. "Doubtless," I mused as 1I walked   ^.-4--PIWliY- --  ^^^^-^^-^ri 174 'THE DRESS-MAKER AND MLDRED. homeward; "Mildred's' confidence to Mrs. Grey relates to the event of yesterday. The dress-maker's story cannot be readily for- gotten." 1 ri  *      "'  '   CHAPTERv X. THE MASTER AND MSTRESS OF GLEN-BECK. "It matters not how long we live, but how."--Festus. F I have said little in this history con- cerning the master and mistress of Glen-Beck, it is because they were not often in my thoughts. With either I had seldom much to do. After matters fell into a settled state, subsequent to my being domi- ciled in the family as governess, I scarcely. saw Mr. Forrester, save at maal-times; and any marks of consideration on his part, such as the placing of the horse at my disposal, were the result, I am sure, of Walworth's thoughtful suggestions. Mrs. Forrester, from the first, had been more than kind to me; but I shrank from her well-meant attentions, for she was coarse and inelegant often, both in manner   T-       -M----.....- .....m... ,-WJ 176 s THE MASTER AND AlISTRESS. and speech. Mrs. Grey was greatly her supe- rior in native refinement and that good breed- ing which is the result of Christian principle and a generous heart. Mrs. Forrester, not being " to the vmanner born," was constantly engaged when in society with thoughts of-its proprieties and conventionalities, with an-en- deavor to maintain well her importance in her circle, and to look the lady she secretly felt herself not. to be. Never at ease, never, by reason of lack of information and taste, er joy-  ing an interchange of thought with cultivated persons whom she met in society, she was restricted to the companionship of those la- dies who, like herself, owed the position they occupied to the cleverness of money-getting husbands, whose wealth was their pride and the only means of their aggrandizement. The life she led- must have been one of ceaseless effort; and I have often thought that she would have been much more heartily at home in her own kitchen, where, she -was fond of superintending, than in her splendid rooms above-stairs, on her reception days. Her perplexity was great when she feared her  ' .  ^   A         - , * - THE MASTER AND MSTRESS.    x7 dignity would be 'compromised, or her rank not properly understood. I remember once 'being greatly amused at her reception of the educated daughter of a widow lady, who called upon some matter of business.  Mrs, For- rester fancied them very much beneath her in position, since they were compelled -to live on straitened means. She did not at first feel sure that it was proper to ask the young per- -son to sit down, and she was still in the midst of her dilemma, when the young lady -quietly seated herself, and made known her errand. I will not attempt to describe Mrs. Forrester's half-annoyed surprise, when Mildred, entering the room shortly after, saluted the visitor warmly, claimed her as a school companion, reproached her for not having called upon her in town, and ended by urging her to spend the day at Glen-Beck. After her departure, for she did not accept Mildred's invitation, her talent and worth were highly praised by Mil- dred, who affirmed 'that " there had not been a girl in class for whom she, had a greater respect." It is probable, had Mrs. Forrester's love for 8*   178  THE, MASTER AND MSTRESS. Walworth 'and Mildred been less of an affec- tion akin to idolatry, she would have reproved them for their partiality to many persons, whom- her favorite leaders of the ton would never have countenanced;- for both Mildred and her brother were singularly free from tile fault of appreciating men and women by the worldly rule which measures pockets, and thence position.

He knew that men condemned him, but he was aware also that few if any had the courage to make their sen- timents known. His coolness and wariness   served him in good stead. Men; said, "This man is no fool ;," and if any spoke of the poor estimation in which his moral character was held, it was with a careful glance around and a 'whispered tone, meant for few ears. The motto: "Get money, ' honestly, if you can: dishzonestly, if you must,' but GET it," was that of too many in the community for them to speak, in loud'or strong disapprobation iof this man's course.. After all, he stood high in this world's opinion; he was a moneyed man; a communicant in the church; an honored member of several societies; a party man whose influence was counted on; it would not do to offend him; his frown was of conse- quence, etc., etc. Mr. Forrester could not be blamed did he congratulate himself on having played his game well, and settled himself com- fortably for this world. . . . For this world! mark you! I make no account of the next.   80  THE MASTER' AND MSTRESS. I do not think that Mr.'or Mrs. Forrester were loved by Walworth and Mildred with even ordinary affection, although both ever evinced a proper respect and attention to their parents' wishes. Mildred shrank from -the coarseness of her mother, and was pained by her want of sympathy in her tastes. For -her father she had few words, and although he took an 'evident pride and delight in her, he was satisfied if she looked happy, and did not seem to require evidence of an active regard on her part. It was-the absence of sterling qualities in both parents, doubtless, that caused this want of affection on the part of their elder children. I was aware that Mrs. Grey had more of Mildred's hearty love than her own mother; and from Walworth she received a genuine respect and consideration, while duty compelled him to offer counterfeits at home. A noble and good woman was Mrs. Grey, and she had brought up these two children in a manner worthy of herself, in accordance with strict Christian principles, and aware of a stand- ard of high moral excellence. Mr. Forrester took a greater pride if possible   THE MAISTER AND MSTRESS.   I 8 I in Walworth than in Mildred. He respected his son', admired him -as far as he,could under- stand him, and was governed by his slightest wishes, however they might differ from his own. Father and son held little intercourse with each other, for their pursuits were utterly at variance. Mr. Forrester would have placed any amount of money at Walworth's disposal, content to offer largely-to him of what he I worshipped most, and most relied on. 'But Walworth was no spendthrift. Since ,my ar- rival at Glen-Beck, I had witnessed his re- peated refusals of money offered him by his father, Who-looked annoyed but made no re- mark, as he returned the rejected notes to his poclket-book. I had observed also that for some time Walworth had dressed with extreme plainness. He had discarded a small gold chain, to which his watch was attached; and a ring, curious from its antique shape, which I had noticed upon his finger when I first knew him, was no longer visible. I more than sus- pected that Walworth's attire owed little to his father's purse, and accident after a space made me aware that the money he received for his O   '       . .   I 82 THE MASTER AND MSTRESS. published essays was alone what he consented to expend on himself. After all, what happiness, what content even, was there in this family, notwithstanding Mr. Forrester's wary watchfulness, or his wife's ceaseless efforts?

What loveliness was there in the freshness, the peace, the promise of this fair landscape! Summer and autumn might change, but could scarcely add to its beauty.

At length, as evening drew on, its rage abated, and wailing over its own work, it died away in a dreary moan at midnight, Morning light showed a waste that summer might not crown, nor autumn clothe with beauty again.

I was engaged in copying for I(ate a sketch of Wal- worth's, taken from his portfolio. An hour or, two of quiet had been mine, when a sum- mons, at the bell announced visitors. They will go away, I thought, when the servant returns "not at home" to their inquiries. But I was mistaken. Poulett had received hospitable orders. If guests came they were to be admitted and asked to partake of lunch- eon. Poulett obeyed to the letter. There was a pause: the ladies held a consultation. Yes,' they would remain. Poulett led the way to the dining-room; Presently I heard them returning. At the drawing-room door they paused.                ' "Would' they step in and be seated?" Poulett asked.,           :i' "Who is that lady?' I heard one inquire rudely, hesitating on the threshold.  -           i  i ....   186  -DOOM TO THE BETROTHED. "Miss Wilmerton," Poulett answered, his French notion of propriety somewhat shocked by the question. "Oh, the governess," was whispered, quite audibly among the ladies. A party of three en- tered and seated themselves comfortably for a, chat, in the chairs Poulett placed for them op- posite the window to which I had drawn my table for better light. Of course the presence of the governess was ignored. Of course they proceeded in their conversation as if the silent girl before them had-neither ears nor feeling. It was character- istic of their clas. The nouveaIx riches are rarely well-bred jor even 'considerate; and I recognized in the fashio-nables before me -women who had commenced married life with perhaps the half of a two-story dwelling for a lodging, but whom an unexpected turn of for- tune, or the talent of sharply calculating hus- bands, had placed in a position they could not be said to grace. I did not see fit -to with- draw, since my presence was no restraint. They discussed a late party in M   with interest, blackened with no light touch the A   DOOM T  THE E  ETROTHED.  I87 characters of one or two of the lady-guests, talked of "loves of shawls" and "splendid silks" to be seen at "Meyrick and Peter- son's," praised highly some costly handker-- chiefs and laces at Madame Rossier's, and finally, coming round to domestic details, they spoke of refractory servants, trouble with seamstresses, and incompetent governesses. Yes; so far they went. Unblushingly- they did this. What motive was, theirs, I cannot guess. If I was. so far beneath them in posi- tion as they would have myself and others understand, why did they seek to mortify me? But their object was apparent. I felt a smile curl the corners of my mouth. I could have laughed in their faces for very disdain. It was not in the power of such as they to wound or sting, I decided; but I erred. Erelong I was hurt, mortally wounded, by a blow one dealt, unwitting of its force. One of the trio before me had "a governess at home," she said, "a good creature, stupid indeed at times, but obliging and kind to the children. She made all the children's. clothes, and was a perfect treasure in her way." '     188 D oO To - THE BETROTHED. "- Save me from governesses!" exclaimed one of the others. "I tried them until I was tired. One was incensed at my requiring her to put the children to bed; another objected to eating in the school-room-; and a third affirmed that two hundred dollars a year was lessthan I paid to my cook, and objected to staying any longer after teaching a term. Disgusted with them all, I sent my oldest daughter to - Madame Merillat's, and Pauline, my maid, hears the two youngest read and spell. I shall try to persuade Madame Merillat to take the three together next- year, although she objects to children." "Speaking-of Madame Merillat," interposed the third lady, " reminds me of something she told me yesterday, when I made an early call on my niece's account. -Mr. Esterlyn,-Law- rence Esterlyn you'know,- Vwho, my husband says, owns a fine property in Warren county, is to be married to one of her pupils, who is some connection of his mother's, I believe.

"Oh yes," returned one of the ladies, "this engagement is quite an understood thing. The lady's name is Manvers--Miss Ellice Manvers." No cry struck my lips apart; no outward I agitation betrayed' me.' The pencil I held in my fingers drew correctly, straight and curved I  and broken lines. But if I was dumb, I was I deaf also.

Yet n11 the time the drawing went on clearly and rapidly. I  Presently a silence made me pause. I looked a up. The apartment was occupied by none save myself. -How or when' the visitors had taken their departure:, I' .could not tell. Gathering up paper and pencils, I mounted to my chamber. "Oh, Lawrence! At last forsaken!" Forsaken! I sought to take the stern truth   190  DOOM TO TH .BETROTHED. to my soul; to crush the knowledge deep into my heart, that the love there might perish at once. Did it die? Was it dead? Some hours later I was still kneeling at my couch, a position I had instinctively assumed *when I first entered my apartment.' I tried not to suffer, but I did suffer sharply and bit- :terly. I tried to feel resigned, but I could not. I was no longer calm. Surging waves of thought tossed-up and down in my mind. As yet there had been no attempt at reflec- tion. Ere long I remembered that Kate had told me, weeks before, that Ellice Manvers was connected ir some way with Lawrence Ester- lyn's mother. 'I made little account of it then. What weight it bore now! Mrs. Esterlyn, though a good, was a proud, stern ' woman. As a child I had always feared her; in my girlhood seldom sought her, and since the time a mutual friend told me of her harsh judgment of her youngest brother, I could not avoid thinking of her with a shrinking dread. It was a pitiful story, that of her brother, Ernest Withersi He was left an infant of two years at his parents' death, and Mrs.   DOOM TO THE BETR O TED. .   19I Esterlyn, then a girl of scarcely eighteen, and the oldest of four children, took sole charge of him. He became her pride and delight, but " also a constant source of care, and at her mar- riage he accompanied her to her husband's home. He grew up a noble, manly youth. Stern as her discipline had been, and strictly as she had enforced arbitrary rules, he loved her with a strength passing belief, and had he been her own: child her affection for him could not have been greater than was the patient, watchful love she bore him. As he approached manhood, she observed him with a vigilance that was careful as it was untiring. She did not imagine for a moment that he would be led into any dissipation, any excess that the world excuses in a youth, but she waited for the effect of that world's-breath upon him. Would he, with his chivalrous sense of honor, his aspirations after the pure and good, sicken of the temptation and sin that would meet him everywhere, at variance with: the lessons she had taught him? Or would he subside into a calm of Nature's teaching, him- self sufficing for himself? She could not ex-   192  DOOM TO THE BETR O THED. pect to be answered until the world became less new to him, until he had learned to rate, with experienced eyes, men and things at their real value. Ill patience, she thought, she waited. Seed-time promised a rare harvest. She would'hope and trust. Was her hope strong? her faith perfect? A  slanderer came. Ernest's principles were made light of; his good name tampered with. It was said he was, no stranger at the, gaming-table. Incensed at the charge, she de- manded proof. It was forthcoming. More than one could testify to his having been seen, flushed and excited, at a gaming-table, in one of the most noted haunts of unprincipled and reckless ,men. It seemed to her that it was possible no longer, to doubt the monstrous truth. She gave belief, but would- far rather have seen him lie before her pal-e and cold in his funeral shroud. IThe stern woman sat silent for hours await- ing Ernest's return. When he came he repaired, as was his custom, to her room. She met him. on the threshold. What she said, or how the shameful story was communi- L I "----- -     ---- -VPBa   * '1 ^ *.   .   .^-.^^^^'    DOOM TO THE BETROTHED.    193 cated, it is impossible ito say. When he com- prehended all, and that she gave credence to the slander, who may censure him for what ensued? Shocked and angered,' he paced the room, with a swift step twice or thrice; then suddenly pausing before her, he said in a hoarse tone, "Sister, is it possible you hlve credited this tale? How dare you listen to it? To doubt is to condemn me. I scorn to prove to you my innocence; you, who should have believed me innecent in the face of a condemning world. Farewell!" The impetuous youth left her presence and the house. Her cruel and bitter words ren- dered him desperate, and hurrying in wild haste through the streets of the city, he reached one of the wharves just as a crowd of persons was leaving a packet-ship about to sail for Europe. He rushed on board, and in less than an hour the ship was under weigh. , The certainty of his sister's want of faith in him had goaded him to frenzy, and one mad act placed him' beyond her reach. He wrote a hurried letter to Mr. Esterlyn, and entrusted   194  n DOOM TO THE BETROTHED. it to the pilot, who returned to the shore after seeing the vessel safe out of the harbor. To Mr. Esterlyn he would explain. "He could not expect from him that confidence his own sister- had denied him," he said. "He would not scorn to exonerate himself\ to him as he would to her. - His presence at the gaming- table was required, by reason of his interest in a youth who had been his companion at col- lege, and who had fallen into the hands of a set of desperate and wily gamesters whom he feared would prove the youth"s' ruin. Expost- ulation and entreaty were of no avail, and he followed'the young man Lo the gaming-house, resolved at least to prevent his becoming; a victim to villany, if it. were in his power. An unfair game was being played. He found means to convince his friend that there was dangerof his becoming a dupe. Then accom- panying him to his lodging, he compelled him, to pledge himself never again to play a game of chance." So far, Ernest deigned to make clear his character to his sister's h'usband. To her- he wrote no line, sent no message, not even a repetition of his last word to her--"Farewell." ,L   DOOM TO THE BETR O THED.   95 But she was'sorely stricken. The-ship that Ernest Withers sailed in, never came to shore. A wild gale swept the Atlantic, and its pas- sengers and crew perished together. "Did not her sorrow teach this woman tenderness and compassion?"I asked myself. "It seemed not. I must have given her mortal offence, to have doubted, even on ra- tional grounds, her son, or her son's right- doing. My note to Lawrence had been re- turned unread at her bidding, I was sure; and she had willed then that Ellice Manvers should marry Lawrence. Lying upon her death-bed she had bound him by a vow he could not   break. I understood it all." A summons to dinner disturbed me. Though inexpressibly wretched, I arose and hastily arranged my disordered dress, for I knew my non-appearance at table would cause inquiry. A severe headache swould account for my paleness, I thought; and I prepared to descend the stairs. On the landing I encountered I Walworth.   i i' Why, Bessie!" he exclaimed, " what has happened?" iara Ssgwa-irr X- -.-..,I. .   196,  DOOM TO THE BETROTHED.     , I looked up in his face, too miserable to.  reply. "You suffer," he said, taking both my hands in his own: -" tell me, can I be of any service?"   I shook my he d. He was touched by the utter hopelessness of the action-. "Bessie, go back to your room," he de- cided. "You were not coming to the dining- room of your own wish and will. What you imagine to be duty compels this. Go back. I will arrange everything.-" He conducted me to the door of my apart- ment. "Now tell me," he said, " would you : like quiet? Do you wish to pass the evening in solitude?" - Oh, yes!"I found voice to say, "I wish it very much."' He put me gently into the room and closed the door. Presently Poulett tapped. He brought a server. upon which was a plate of delicacies and a cup of tea. "Mrs. Forrester hopes you will try to eat a little, Mi'ss Bessie," he said. I took what he had brought, thanked him, ,;crs bIP  .l, .   ..    .    DOOMr TO THE BE TROTHED.   i97 and made the door fast. Then I commenced pacing up and down the room.. The tumult was subsiding in my brain; it worked to some purpose now. "Larry loves me," I said to myself after a time; '"he loves me as I love him. Of this I am very sure. If I could persuade myself that he no longer loved me, the agony could be better borne. Pride would sting me to rebellion against my own weakness. But Lawrence is mine. He will not do a right thing if he marry Ellice Manvers, 'With the memory of our last meeting in his heart. And he must remember. He cannot forget. That stern woman in her grave has done a- great wrong to her child and to me. Had she no pity in her soul? no tenderness in her ' eart? Could she not forgive my hasty judgment of Lawrence, when my brain was half crazed with a bitter grief? My punishment is greater than my fault. What right had' she to ad- judge my fate? How dare she say 'love,' and 'love not,' to her son, as she listed? God-given power that .never was. Why should he obey? But he will obey. Of this "Ba "i " "" "-        ' ,   4*   I98  DOOM TO THE BETROTHED. I am certain. It is this obedience 'that has kept him silent and absent, and will in the end compel him to a sacrifice.

When'the priest's blessing is pro- nounced, and he takes her in his arms, will he not think of another, who is more truly his than she can ever be? If they past through life together, will no shadow inter- vene? Will not a haunting memory startle him, even in serious moments, and when life's cares are hardest to be borne? God help him, and God help me! We shall both be very wretched." I buried my face in my hands and wept.   CHAPTER XII. "OSS AND SUBSTITUTION.

And, so the rod falls again, and. yet again, until the chastened and humbled sufferer can under- stand the puniishment that serves to lead him to the cross. I did not seek God in my woe, save with vain and vague petitioning words. ,There was little -faith ; there was less hope; a blank despair filled my, mind.  Heavily the tempests gathered; great waters flowed over me in the night-of my distress. And the winds ceased not, the whelming floods did not abate, until I cried, prostrate in humiliation, "I no longer refuse to drink of the bitter cup, oh my Father! Thy will be done!" I have little remembrance of how 'the time passed the week following that miserable day, on which I learned the news of Lawrence Esterlyn's engagement. Very wretched I was, and incompetent to perform the most trivial of my duties. Mildred had gone with her mother to spend a few days with a friend in the neighborhood, and I was thus freed from the inquiries which otherwise must have  ,*  .-             q   "OSS AND SUBSTITUTIONg.   201 been made had they been at home. Walworth did not question me; he saw that I shrank from observation, and allowed me to pass him with scarce a remark. Fromn Mr. Forrester I received little notice. I doubt whether he knew that I was altered. It is a dreary thing to rise, in the morning, with no hope for its hours; to lie down at night with no cheerful thought of the morrow. My days were' a weariness to me. I took many listless rambles alone, for I had asked Kitty to accompany the children in their walks, feeling myself wholly unfit to -ianswer their questions, after the school exercises were over. The task of instructing them had become in-- supportably tedious, and I was frequently obliged to give over hearing a lesson from an utter incapacity to understand it. Mrs. Grey met me in one of my walks, and questioned me concerning my health, with an earnest, anx- ious look, and urged me to come for a day to the farm. I found means to avoid another meeting.     - , The restless wandering in the open air was far preferable to the solitude of my own apart- 9* 9         202   -LOSS AND SUBSTITUTION. ment, and night fell often before I returned to its dreary precincts. Once more inclosed within its walls, I sat motionless for hours, un- conscious of the lapse of time. When I souaht my pillow I did not rest well, but. often awoke wildly weeping. My life's, sorrow permitted no refreshing sleep. Midnight found me send- ing forth strange priayers into the lonely dark- ness encompassing me, prayers that were not heard by reason of their selfish, earthly nature. Often the dawn coming over the hills has looked. into my chamber, to find a watcher sitting beside a tear-bedewed couch, or rapidly pacing the floor with unshod feet. This state of things could not long continue. One night I awoke, and by the light of the lamp I had neglected to extinguish, I saw the ceiling of my room change gradually into the arched and fretted roof of a vast temple. Im- mense pillars rose throughout the structure, to an immeasurable height, and the spaces be- tween, which were like the aisles in a cathedral, were strewn with gold and gems of inestimable value. At the foot of one of these pillars my couch was placed. Countless multitudes of  *           ^      "OSS AND SUBSTITUTION.    203- men and women hurried past me, treading the precious ore and stones under foot. Erelong, they reached a large vault-like apartment,  where dark figures seized them, and presently their stiffened forms filled innumerable niches in the walls of the gloomy dungeon. Follow-- ing these, a sombre procession and an agitated crowd approached. They bore the Lady Jane Grey to execution. I saw her, black-robed and silent, go by, with meek eyes raised heav- enward ,in a holy calm.  I witnessed the i white slender neck bared; I saw the axe. de- scend; I looked upon the headless body ere it was borne to the death-chamber. Then Mrs. Esterlyn came to my couch and bade me rise, I followed her to one of the great doors of the temple.  Tumultuous ocean waves washed a barren shore- at our feet. Far out at sea, I saw the rocky fastnesses of St. Helena, drear spot of Napoleon's banishment and death. I looked at my conductress. She raised her' hand and beckoned.  Mermaids, with long  i tresses and bodies having a fish's glittering scales, rose gliding upon the waves. My com- panion addressed them.  "Take this exiled   + - -0 - 204 . LOSS AND SUBSTITUTZO N. and lost one to yonder island," she said. ,' There let her abide." She held me. The changing, hateful creatures approached. I struggled and shrieked in terror, until she loosed her hold, and I fell to the earth. ;I remember no more until I became con- scious of a new state of things about me. I could not move; an intolerable pain was in my head, and my body seemed to be too heavy for me to attempt to rise, or even turn. My apartment, too, was unnaturally dark, for I knew-that it was day; I heard the cheerful carol of birds in the trees outside my windows, and the voices of happy children at play in the garden below. After my eyes became accus- tomed to the dimness in the room, I noted familiar objects lying about, and soon I dis- covered Mrs. Grey seated at the foot of my bed. When she saw that I perceived her, she arose and offered me a draught that proved bitter and nauseous. Then I slept. Dreams visited me. I thought a narrow path stretched interminably before me. I walked and walked, and when, wearied, I paused to rest, a voice said I must rise and journey on. Pitiless and   "OSS AND SUBSTITUTION.    205 * stern it-sounded. I essayed to obey. In the effort I awoke. Mildred Forrester stood at my bedside with the physician. "This fever must be checked," I heard him say. The two walked a little distance from my couch. I heard a whispered consultation. '"Am I very ill," I thought, and again fell into troubled slumber. Then followed, they say, days and nights of watching beside a restless one who called con- tinually "Mother! Mother!" and who said with moaning sighs that " there was no love or truth on earth save in a mother's heart." I remember perfectly Mildred's form, bending over or beside me constantly. It was she who gave me water to drink when parched -lips murmured "I thirst."' It was she who laid cool fingers on my brow, and spoke caressing words as she parted the hair away from aching temples. I know that in the sane intervals of this fevered period, I was distressed to learn how I should be enabled to go about my daily duties once more. Content to die, I was' troubled to-ascertain how I might be made re- signed to live. Life spread before me a cold, calm sea, over which my bark was to glide on           ^   .   20o6  LOSS AND SUBSTITUTIONz. a chill, drear voyage that had now no aim or purpose. 'Days and nights of renewed fever- followed meditations like this. At length there came coolness and quiet, and one day a kind- of vision was vouchsafed, that 'gave me .strength and peace. It was near evening. I lay and looked calmly about me at the objects in the room, and upon as much of the fair landscape -as was visible beyond the open window, until my sight, finally returning, rested upon the white coverlet of my bed. As I looked, it seemed to rise in height; it grew -it spread--it became a hill, then a mountain in size, a mountain of pure snow crowned with glaciers. Suddenly at its base appeared a :: gray horse, with a young, slight woman for'its rider, who urged the noble creature up and up the difficult steep with determined courage. Long, amber-colored tresses floated from be- neath a kind of helmet cap upon her head, and her hand held a crimson banner, upon which a white Greek cross shone, with these words plainly visible on its arms: My King. My Law. My Leader. My Light. i  "  -         ,  ,  ,    '   "OSS AND SUBSTITUTION.    207 I watched her as she struggled on and up in her perilous course with her good steed. Her banner gleamed red against the snow, but' it never drooped or swayed aside. A firm hand held it. And far on high, almost at the top of the mountain, gathering darkness shut the vision from my sight. As my fever and dreams departed, strength returned. Mrs. Grey and Mildred sat alter- nately at my bedside, and although, when I first essayed to talk, they smilingly enjoined silence, ,they at length allowed me to use my tongue to purpose, and satisfied all my inquiries. "Nurse Matty," I said one day. when Mil- dred had left the room, " was I very deliri- ous? What did I say )rhen the -fever was on?" "' Oh, you talked a deal about many things, Miss Bessie. Strange and fanciful- ideas were running through your mind, and you men- tioned often the names of Mildred, and your mother, and Larry, Have you a brother, Miss Bessie?" "I have three, Nurse," I answered.   208   LOSS AND SUBSTITUTrION. "And one is a favorite?" she inquired. "You are very fond of Larry?" i' Yes," I replied evasively, and I felt my cheeks grow warm with the blood her question called to them. It was well the good nurse : had her head bent upon, the aprgn she was hemming. "Oh, it was piteous to hear you," she went on, "-when you lay tossing in the fever, moan- ing about some cruel woman, who you feared had power-to work you ill. And once, poor dear, you would rise from the bed in spite of all our efforts to, prevent it, for you had a long way to journey, you said, and might not rest.", "Did I give you so much- trouble, dear nurse?"I -said. "I must have been a great' charge to you. I amglad I am able to thank you now, and some day, when I feel stronger, I will try to tell you ,how grateful I feel for all your motherly care of me." She bent over me with a caressing gesture, and put her finger lightly on my lips. "No more talking, dear," she said. "Sleep now." And I did sleep a painless slumber, and awoke refreshed. -   ye,    .LOSS AND SUBSTITUTION.    209 As I lay in my slow convalescence, inert and helpless--for I was unable to sit up any length of time-my mind was very busy. I think I was ,resigned to the will of God. Precious promises from Holy Writ occurred to me, and out of my great affliction peace was perfected at last. One day I had asked Mrs. Grey for my little copy of a Kempis; but when she found and handed it to me, I could not read it. My weakened sight was powerless for the effort. Mildred took the book from me and read aloud. "But I would not have thee seek for such a peace, as to be without temptations, or -to meet with no adversities." "But even then to think thou hast found peace, when thou shalt be exercised with di- vers tribulations and tried in many adversities." "And the more thou xwithdraweth thyself from all' comfort of things created,: the more sweet and the more powerful consolations-wilt thou find in Christ." "But thou shalt not first attain to, these without some sorrow and labor in the conflict." " The old custom will stand in the way, but by a better custom it shall be overcome." x .           z10   LOSS AND SUBSTITUTION. /"The flesh will complain, but by the fervor of the Spirit-it shall be kept under." "The old serpent will tempt thee and give thee trouble, but by prayer he shall be put to flight; moreover,. by keeping thyself always employed in some useful labor, his access to thee shall be in a great measure impeded." Precious sentences! they led to a train of- : serious reflection. Prayer and labor on earth, I thought; Christ and rest in heaven.

"WHAT WE ARE SET UPON EARTH' FOR"- WILLOW BROOK. "Life is full of sorrow, Which no words can tell; We may pine in loneliness Though in crowds we dwell." All is yours,?" says the promise: ' life, death, things present, things to come.' In the face of such words can I say I have lost all?"         AMABEL.

"Yes, indeed, Miss, and I told him   you ,were at home, but he couldnot remain,' he said. I-,                 I     E   2I4     WILL-OW BROOE .' -You may go now," Mildred said as Lolotte lingered. Tapping absently the win- dow-pane with her fingers, Mildred's eyes sought the distant mountain-view. The sun had nearly set; indeed it Was almost dusk inll the room, although the clouds Cwere purple and,  golden above the mountain-gap. I lay on a sofa near, and watched for some time the changing expression in my dear companion's face. Presently large tears fell' down upon her dress. I roused nyself and tried to find asafe subject to amuse and interest, and soon I had the comfort' of success. Mildred ,came and sat beside me, holding my hand withl caressing affection. My conversations with her at this time. were never without a secret motive. Before my illness I had noticed that Dana Poinsett began to avoid her. -The study of German was discontinued, and he seldom came now of an evening, unless Walworth could give him the attention he demanded'for some scientific discussion. I had remarked also a ,gradual change in Mildred's manner towards him. She became shy and distant, ! and finally proud and cold, but she: never j   WILLOW- BROOK.      215 missed being present at Mr. Poinsett's inter- views with her brother.  I saw that his conduct pained her, but I knew that I^ might I not attempt any- consolation, for hers was a nature from which I might expect no confes- sion on a subject like this. If a love that had made her life precious, failed her, what hope was there in store for her? Despite Mrs. Grey's teachings and example, I was aware that religion to Mildred was little, more than a theory still. She had never put the faith it enjoined into practice. And now, with sorrow coming, for I saw its sure approach, I wished to point out to her a secure haven, where, when her bark was -adrift on a desperate sea, she might anchor in safety. When I grew strongeir, and was able to take a short drive every day with Walworth and Mildred, there came letters for me from the West and from   Mrs. Seytoun. My dear mother, to whom I had written just before my illness of what I knew and what I suspected concerning Lawrence Esterlyn's engagement,  urged my coming immediately to the West. '        :     .   -2i6!    WILLOW BROOK.  Kate might remain at Madame Merillat's; my' parents could make a sacrifice and keep her there; but I, because they knew my sorrow, guessed my suffering, must be sheltered by their love, soothed by their sympathy and care.. "I must write immediately,"  my mother said, " saying that I had received her letter, and my father would then start for the East, as soon as my answer reached him." I did write at once, but refused utterly to , relinquish my situation at Glen-Beck. I knew   E that my father's plans 'for my bro'thers' educa- tion. would be broken by such a step, and what would it avail? If my duties were  unperformed, a new ingredient'of self-blame would be added to the already bitter cup it was ordained I should drink. I would remain and work, much as I needed my mother's consoling and pious words ; such was my de- cision.          ,  The letter from Mrs. Seytoun containedfa most kind and urgent invitation to come to Willow Brook, her place of residence, as soon as I was able to endure the fatigue of travel. i The children, accompanied by Kitty, must    WILLOW BROOK.     ; 217 come also, she said; for them she promised employment and amusement; for me, quiet- ness and a mother's care. Had this invitation been for myself alone, I should have hesitated to accept it, for I 'felt my pupils required attention; but Mrs. Seytoun's inclusion of 'the children in her thoughtful kindness, re- moved at once the only objection I might make. She had learned of my illness from a late letter of Mildred's, and: wrote imme- diately to me. Little as I knew of this kind lady, and short as our acquaintance had been, I felt that I should love her, could I be per- mitted to claim her friendship. I sent her a letter of acceptance and thanks. As soon as I was able, I would go to Willow Brook. The day before I left Glen-Beck for Mrs. Seytoun's home, I drove to M        to' bid Kate farewell. She had been absent during the whole time of my illness, on a visit to a schoolmate, who lived-some miles distant from the city, and was but now returned to Madame Merillat's. Shocked and grieved at my altered appearance, it was some time before she would consent to my leaving her in M     ,and it     218     WILLOW BROOK. was only with the greatest difficulty that I suc- ceeded in persuading her to do so. I left her at length, pacified with my promise to write to her once a week during' the time of my ab- sence; and I punctually redeemed my word. Mrs. Forrester and Walworth acpompanied us to Willow Brook. When I first took my seat in the cars, which conveyed us two-thirds of the distance from the -city of M , I could not but confess to a slight trembling and confusion; for I remembered vividly the terri- fied feeling with which I had heard the roar of the fearful Steam Demon, when helpless, and, I judged, doomed to a dreadful fate, I had heard its near approach. We were far on our way before I quitexregained composure. "How the trees look, Miss Wilmerton," said Lillian, who had been gazing from one of the windows in a sort of wondering --silence. We were moving at a very rapid rate, faster than I remembered being conveyed over' the road before. To my watching eyes, this race of the rail-cars, looked like a magi- cian's work. We left trees behind us, moving in a mad waltz; fences went up, up-downi   WILLOW BROOK.     2I9 down, and vanished; houses came and peeped at us and fled away; light brown earth and grass, mingled their colors, making an inde- scribable greenish gray; rocks passed us with a roar; water rushed by with more than cata- ract speed, but made no sound; and we all the time seemed to get with a madder motion on- ward, while all these tere jumping or skip- ping or running the other way. When the cars stopped, Walworth obtained a conveyance, and we were soon at Willow Brook, where we were warmly welcomed -by Mrs. Seytoun., Mrs. Forrester and Walworthl remained but a night, and were on their. homeward journey before I had risen 'in the morning. Mrs. Seytoun was at my bedside when I awoke.  '          ' "When you are ready to rise, I will assist you to dress, my dear," she said, "and then we will walk in the garden before breakfast. The air will do you good." I thanked her, but "could not think of troubling her," I said. "Indeed, I was able to' dress myself."  But she hovered about me, brushed my hair,   I[ LI I I ........          ...--...--- ' - 220   -  WILLOW BROOK.  fastened my dress, and offered many little cor- dial attentions, with a gentle motherly grace, that touched me inexpressibly, and I let her have her way. In descending the stairs we met the children. "Oh, Miss Wilmerton!" exclaimed Lillian. "This ism such^ a beautiful place. I have not been here since I was a tiny girl, and I did not remember much about it. We have been all over the grounds, and I like Willow Brook a great deal better than Glen-Beck."' "That is because it is yet new to you, Lily," said Mrs. Seytoun smiling. "Willow Brook is not so fine a place as Glen-Beck." :"Oh, Hlike it much better"Lillian returned with enthusiasm. "And beside," here interposed Tommy, ( we can go a nutting in the old woods not far,  from here. May we go to-day, ma'am?" he asked Mrs. Seytouin. ' "Yes," she said, "if Roger can go with you."  - Roger McKenna was an old servant who had lived in Mrs. Seytoun's father's family from his boyhood, and now acted as a sort of overseer   WILLOW BROOK.      22  for his mistress, although his age permitted the performance of no active duties. '( Roger can go," the children shouted, as they came back, and then ran in quest of their cousins Willie and Charles. They were soon found, and the merry- company set forth. - Mrs. Seytoun and I walked in the garden, and then we breakfasted. The conversation that succeeded was full of interest. In the course of it I discovered that she and my mother had lived near each other in the city for years, until her husband's death. She spoke of my mother With respect and affection, for they had. been dear friends. We were thus knit to- gether by a new tie, beside that of the mutual- liking which had drawn us to one another from the beginning of our acquaintance, I found Willow Brook to be what Lillian had described it, a beautiful place, though scarcely to be compared with Glen-Beck. It had been in Mrs. Seytoun's father's family for several generations. Originally a farm, it had been converted into a summer residence by Mrs. Seytoun's father, and at her husband's death she had made it her home. The house was A'   A     222     WILLOW BROOIO. large and old-fashioned, and possessed little architectural beauty. It was surrounded by fine oldtrees of-more than a century's growth, and shady paths among these led: to a pretty garden, in the rearl of which was a fine orchard. The! place received its name from a willow- shaded brook, which ran through part of the grounds, and formed at one point the dividing line between it and an adjacent farm. The interior of the house was well and comfortably furnished; the rooms were bright and pleasant, and in many of them were hung fine old pict, ures, which I looked at with exceeding interest. My stay at Willow Brook was prolonged to three weeks. During that time I improved in bodily and mental health. Though the waters of the spring at which I had drank with eager lips flowed now no more for me, I was in a measure resigned and trustful that' a supply of "living water" would never be denied. ; I do not know whether Mrs. Seytoun suspected that a 'malady of the heart had caused' the body's illness; it,- is more than probable that she did, but she never by look or tone be- trayed her intuition of a foregone suffering.   WILLOW BROOK I     223 Gentle, lovely Christian lady! It was good for me to be with her; I was blest during my sojourn at her home. She never suffered me to lack amusement or employment, yet she watched that I was in no degree overtaxed or wearied.- Her manner to me was always that of the tenderest mother. When she came to my couch at night, before she retired to her own; when she bestowed upon me caressing kisses-in the morning, for she was seldom ab- sent from my bedside when I awoke-I was frequently touched almost to tears, for I knew that she never saw me fmove about or lie down to rest, without a thought of her dead Marga- ret in her heart.       ' - We often visited together the graves of her children. One, a boy, had diedin infancy;, the others, Margaret and Amy, had not been six months laid beneath the flowers that were often watered by her tears. When seated to- gether beside these mounds she often spoke of her dear ones with the tenderest love and grief. One day she had overheard little Willie For-, rester say to his cousin, "Grandmamma never laughs, does she, Frank?"   224  ,WILLO W BROOK.  She referred to this, when near sunset we sat in the churchyard together. "Ah!" she said, i" we carry-,from the graves of our beloved dead coldness and sorrow to be about us amid the homes of thel living." And then she told me a sad tale. I learned that!, indirectly, the failure of the Talbot Bank ! had caused the death of both her daughters. The trial 'and subsequent flight of Mr. Forrester--the knowledge of the odium at- tached to her husband's character-the dis- grace which she felt clung to herself and her children--how might Margaret bear up under it? And Amy felt it as well. "Oh, my dear friend," I said, when the sor- rowful tale was finished, " you have suffered t How shall you ever endure to look upon Mr. Forrester again? How may he hope orfor for- giveness at your hands?" "Bessie," she returned, "Christ washed the feet of Judas Iscariot. What a lesson for us!" Let me give you, Marie, as a short episode in this history of my governess life, the mournful story of Margaret and Amy Seytoun,   WILLOW BROOK.     . 225 ini order that you may understand with what an unspeakable tenderness my heart went out toward their stricken and lonely mother, to whom I would fain have been a daughter indeed, in her dead Margaret's stead.  .i     CHAPTER XI V.

MARGARET AND AMY SEYTOUN.. 227  The visitor was shown into an apartment near the entrance. As he advanced into it, he saw, through an inner door, Mr. Erastus For- rester, risen from the breakfast table and stand- ing with a gloomy and determined look before a young slight woman, his wife, who exclaimed within the stranger's hearing, in earnest, im- passioned accents, and with clasped beseeching hands,! "Oh, Mr. Forrester! yes, poverty-,beg- gary-anytzing but disgrace-!  ,The servant announced a visitor, and the inher door was hurriedly closed. X The stranger was a friend of Mrs. Seytoun's, and had called at her desire upon the- cashier ,of the Talbot Bank, to inform him of the cir- culation of some rumors derogatory to its credit. When Mr. Forrester - appeared, he talked plausibly with his visitor, assured him that the bank was safe enough, discussed with- him the best means to be taken for discovering the origin of the rumors, and finally dismissed him with the impression that the affairs of the bank could not be in safer and -better hands than those of its present cashier. Three days    228 MARGARET AND AMY SEYTOUN. after this interview, the failure of the Talbot Bank wasknown tihroughout the State. Feeling very much as if he had been made a dupe by  a man whose conduct he was compelled to term villanous, the stranger recalled Mrs. For- rester's beseeching attitude, her words of agonized entreaty, and understood'all. When Mrs. Forrester left her elegant home i in the city after her husband's clandestine de- parture, and came to Willow Brook with her children, her mother trusted that the absence of all exciting causes would'restore her mind after a space to its usual tranquillity, for she had been fearfully distressed byMr. Forrester's delinquency and its consequences. But as time passed on, she fell into a state of hope- less depression, from which neither the affec- tionate efforts of her mother and sister, nor the assiduous attentions of friends, could  arouse her. Days--weeks passed,,but no change in her, state occurred. Her mother consulted physicians, but no advice proved beneficial, Her husband's crime (from the first she had called it by no other name) and   -MARGARET AND AMY SEYTOUN. 229 her children's disgrace were constantly in her mind. At one time, in answer to her mother's en- treaties' thatshe -would strive to bear up under her affliction for the sake of her boys, she ex- claimed passionately: "And -why strive' for them, mother? They bear a stained name. Better they were dead before me! Better that Iwere dead than live to see them grow up deficient in honesty of pur- pose and all holy principle. - Oh! mother! that I should have given birth to beings like these!" "But, my daughter, your poor innocent children--'   : "Aye!" she interrupted, "innocent now, just as Erastus Forrester lay once a pure fair babe on his mother's bosom. Such he was! What is he?" i"Margaret,' said Mrs. Seytoun solemnly, "have you forgotten the criminal's petition to One thorn-crowned and dying at his side? Can you not leave' both husband and children in the hands of the atoning Saviour?" "Oh my God! my God!" The poor sufferer wept. That night she'was    30 230 MARGAREtT AND AMY SEYTOUN. delirious and restless. The next day her- fever grew worse. :Medical aid was useless. She raved incessantly, entreating, reproaching, con-  demning her husband. At length, after eight. days of insane tossing and wail, she awoke calm, sane, and dying, and asked for her chil- dren. When they were brought to her bed- side, she'strained them in a close pressure to her breast. Then clasping her hands above the young heads laid together upon her bosom, she prayed: ( Oh God! protect these my childreni- So guide them through life that they shall be Thine at death.' Let Him who suffered ' little ones to come' be -very near to them. Amen." Released from her embrace, the children hid their tearful faces in their grandmother's bosom. Mrs. Forrester looked earnestly at her mother, who said, as if in answer to a question: "They shall be dear to me as my-own life. Margaret, be sure of this." "Oh I am! I am!" ,'she murmured; and the death-stupor crept over her, th'e white eyelids drooped, the pale lips closed. Margaret was at rest.    MALRGARSET AND AMY SEYTOUN.   231 When the feet of those who bore her sister forth for burial were crossing the threshold of her home, Amy Seytoun wai laid upon a sick- bed ; and one, a youth whoj stood within the porch to watch the outgoing of the mournful - procession, heard the tidingsI with dismay. "Is Miss Amy very ill, Roger?": he inquired of the old' servant, who stood weeping in the doorway.. "Aye is she!" returned the old man. "Our fair Lily lies drooping and crushed sore." The youth's brow contracted as with pain, but speakingno other word, he joined the train of mourners who followed the dead to the burial-ground. Edward Lester and Amy Seytoun were to have been married within the year that saw Mrs. 'Erastus Forrester's return to Willow Brook. Known to each other from childhood, theirs was a deeply-rooted affection, that blest might make the happiness of a lifetime,o blighted would cause td each a measureless grief. Their betrothal was known to all their friends, and Edward Lester, noble and -devoted, was esteemed well worthy -of Amy-"the   232 MARGARET AND AMY SEYTOUN. fair Lily," old Roger had named her from a  child. - -    -           i After Margaret's return to Willow Brook, Amy saw her lover less frequently than had, been her wont. Her sister's state of health- demanded- her constant attendance. Edward was patient and content for a time, to see her in the early morning or late in the evening of each day, but even this was denied him affter a space. -Amy was undergoing an ordeal. Until she had satisfied her own mind in regard to a certain point, she would neither see nor speak with her lover. "Edward is below, and wishes to see you," said Mrs. Seytoun to her one day. "Go, Amy, -he is wretched about you." "Mother," said Amy, pausing and speaking with haste, :"will it be right for Edward to connect himself with one whose brother-in-law is spoken-of in, terms like this?" and taking from the table a city journal, she pointed to a paragraph, in which Mr. Erastus Forrester and his brother were denounced as I' unscrupulous, unprincipled," and infamous men, who were not   MARGARET AND AMY SEYTOUN. 233 likely in the end, however, to find much enjoy- ment in ill-gotten gains."  ,  Mrs. Seytoun was spared the pain of reply- ing -to this appeal, by the entrance of Mrs. Forrester's physician; but Amy's mind was already decided, and taking the journal in her hand, she descended the stairs to meet her lover. What' was said during this interview was never known. Mrs. Seytoun overheard Edward's voice in earnest expostulation, and with:a boding heart she awaited the result of Amy's decision, for she was aware, almost from the first, 'of the course her daughter would feel it right to pursue. Both her children had been educated in principles of the sternest Christian virtue, and she might not complain, if by their conduct they proved that her teachings were unforgotten. But it was a bitter trial. The lovers parted. Amy told her mother of her refusal to marry Edward under existing circumstances. That was all. But her cheek grew pale, and her step languid. Her failing health was .-not wholly attributable to her at- tendance upon her sister, and when Margaret was laid in the death silence, Amy was fast de-   .    234 MARGARET AND AMY SEYTOUN. dining, but with little fever and no delirium. Hers was a calm, almost painless, passage to' the tomb. As her last hours approached she exhibited a wonderful serenity. It was night. An utter silence reigned throughout the house. Edward, in the room below Amy's, sat listening for a summons from' Mrs. Seytou-n with a sickening heart. \ Amy had lain in a quiet, dreamy state for hours, and her physician affirmed that another morning sun would not- find her living. Mrs. -Seytoun was seated beside her in a kind of' despairing 'calm. " Mother," said the sick girl suddenly, "is it not night, and are there stars and a moon?" "Yes, my love,"' returned Mrs. Seytoun, "the white moonlight is over all things. Shall I draw the curtain?" "Yes, mother, and tell me how everything looks to you. If I could see it, I should view it with very different eyes from yours, dear mother, since it'would be for the last time." Mrs. Seytoun exerted herself. She quelled the rising sobs; her voice'was calm and clear. "The moon is not visible from this window,"   NMARGARET AND AMY SEYTOUN. 235 she said, " but the tops of the old trees are sil- vered with her light, and the little brook catches a glimmer and a sparkle here and there, and the glimpse I have of'the garden shows the walks clear and unshaded. Above, the stars shine in the blue with a surpassing brilliancy. The night is very fine, my love." ( Thank you, mother! When I close my eyes I can see it all." There was a pause.   Then Amy said quickly, "Mother, call Edward, for I think I am dying."  Edward came. He knelt beside her couch. Supported in her mother'sarms, Amy looked at him. {"What parts us, Edward?" she asked. "Death, Amy," he replied, awed by the look in her eyes, but struck at heart by the pain of this parting. ( Not death ; God, Edward. Farewell for a little season." She put her arms about ihis neck, pressed her lips to his brow, and then laying her head back on her mother's bosom, passed away without a moan.   '236 MARGARET AND AMY SEYrTOUN.

There were cool delicious mornings; there were warm bright days; over the landsdape hung a purple mistnot obscuring, but soften- ing all things; there were sunsets of unimagin- able beauty; the splendor of the season was at its height.

We never liked to be long separated from each other. The routine of our lives seemed the same as before my illness, yet all was not quite the same. Something was different. I sought to discover what. I found it in a shade- that rested on Mildred's brow, iin a troubled, restless look in her large eyes, and a lack of her wonted candor with me. -What might be the cause.   Erelong I learned it. One day I had sought Mildred, about the house and garden in vain. I wished to find -her immediately if possible, for there was an ,exceedingly fine light falling from a high stained window upon the halo-circled head of a saint in a picture, that hung in an upper hall.- I had happened twice or thrice to see it in this light, and had described it to Mildred as very beautiful. Anxious to see it, she had watched :for this effect of a certain sunlight for some days, in vain. To-day it was fine, but where was Mildred? I was on my way back to the painting after a fruitless search below-stairs, i                        A    FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE.     239 when, in passing Mrs. Forrester's room-door, I perceived that it was ajar. I had found Mildred here frequently before, and knowing. that Mrs. Forrester had: gone to the city, I pushed the door open and looked in.- Mildred was there, but so absorbed in reading that she did not hear my entrance, which was quite hurried enough to attract her attention. She stool before an open drawer in her mother's bureau, and her hands held one of the city journals Mrs. Forrester had always locked so carefully from sight. Her back was toward me, and I had approached near enough to read the name of the paper, which was printed in clear, large type at the top of the page. Re- treating again, for now I did not wish her to. discover my presence, I watched for a time the effect of roused feeling in the crimson-dyed cheek and compressed lip, as she read. Like our first mother, there she stood gaining for- bidden knowledge; her own hand plucked the banned fruit. "Oh Mildred," I thought, (' the sword will soon wave between 'the Para- dise you are leaving and the barren world be- yond. Heretofore, life has had few shadows; y    240   FORBIDDEN KNOWL EDGZ. who may guess the depth of the gathering gloom? The sorro w consequent on this knowl- edge of evil, albeit it be not of your own doing, will effectually bar your return to the happiness of past days." After' this Mildred went daily .to her mother's room, .after Mrs. Forrester had left it 'for her drive to the city. For a week she made these secret visits, until, it is probable, the journals all perused, she had no longer a motive to take her thither. I pitied her sin- cerely during this period. Many of the arti- cles on the failure of the Talbot Bank were written in an exceedingly vindictive spirit, oand although the truth was spoken, it was in many cases with the bitterest sarcasm. Per- haps it was necessary so to speak; but what availed it all, since the offenders were not brought. to justice. I could fancy Mildred shrinking as she read, the clearly-told, oft- repeated tale of fraud designed and carried to a successful issue. I could imagine the pain she endured, when the .epithets coupled With her father's name met her eye.

How impatishe first discoismered the papers, or what led to their perusal, it is impossible to say. I ; learned but the fact that all was clear to Mil- dred at last. The coldness of friends, the gloom on her father's brow, the scornful, half impatient stoicism of Walworth, which she could not but be startled at, at times, were all accounted for. She could be deceived no longer by -the watchful kindness of those about her, for the source of the shadow brooding over her home was at length discovered to her. How did it affect her? At 'first in a shade, as I have said, a reserve between herself A and me. Then, when her visits to her mother's room ended, she went daily for a time to Mrs. I  Grey. I rejoiced at this, for I knew that the i  comforting words I longed to speak would come better from Nurse Matty, whom Mil- dred had made her confidant from a child.  . I felt that I had no right to say aught to her, since she had-solicited from me neither sympa- thy nor advice. A gradual change was appar-   *  "   242   FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE. ent in her from this time. Quieter, sadder, weeping often in secret, Mildred's face began to look worn and pale, and her manner became listless and weary. Mingled with Walworth's unhappiness, was a manly will to dare and to do, and a scorn and pride which no earthly ill could wholly conquer.' But though Mildred was proud too, with her it took only the form of reserve and silent endurance. Gentler, milder even than before, she could never become scornful. Her countenance wore a sadly sweet look, which I trusted through the; divinely blest teachings of her nurse, would become in time an expression of Christian resignation. Just at this time, Esther Miller, Frank's poor old woman at the village, lay on her death-bed, and Mildred went at Frank's earnest entreaty to see her. She found the poverty- stricken woman in great mental distress, at the thought of leaving her grandchild Philip, alone and unfriended. She could not, with any degree of resignation, commit the sickly and gentle boy to the mercies of the coarse and unfeeling people about her. Mildred was much touched by her distress, and after a few   ,             , X   -FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE.    243 moments' reflection, promised, if she could obtain her father's consent, and she thought it not difficult to' gain, that the lad should re- main under Andy Ray's charge at Glen-Beck. When old Mrs. Miller died, the boy was brought to Mildred, who immediately commenced the task of instructing him. 'He was a gentle, sen- sible boy, with a great deal of native refine- ment and some cultivation; and having been kept at the village school by his grandmother, could read as well, and possessed as much knowledge of the common English branches, as Tommy Forrester.  After a time, when I found that Philip Arran was the constant com- I ' panion of the children after school-hours, I i proposed to Mildred that he should be allowed il! .to recite his lessons -with my pupils.

Mildred, however, did not relinquish I  her care of him. She clothed him respectably    244 FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE. 2AA and comfortably, and he was directed'to come to her with any request or complaint he might have to make. The boy looked up to her with a kind of admiring love that was half ! adoration. He was gifted with a keen sense - of the beautiful; and I often observed him gaz-  ing at her with evident and innocent delight.  His benefactress entertained for him an affec- tion that daily grew stronger as the lad proved i himself worthy of her protection and kindness;  and I was aware that it served to divert her mind from dwelling on a secret grief. - i rllBCPs     A  e"   CHAPTER XVI.

Thus weak-was I still. But I did not yield long to a passionate regret.  I had    246    DRIVE TO THE CITY. learned to governmyself. "Lawrence, when he returns, is to be the husband of another," I reasoned. "I have no right to think of him more. -God aid me to put,him out of my thoughts. I must keep my self-respect, and, come what may, this sorrow shall be subdued. It may be a life-long task, I know. I feel sure that years will pass before I shall have learned to think of him calmly; but the patient striv- ing will achieve victory in the end, although I see not well now in what manner a perfect resignation is to be attained. I suppose when I shall have learned to give all my thoughts to heaven, as" nuns are presumed to do. Until then I must carry on a continual warfare with my own heart."   And at the end Jof every- struggle with myself, I prayed Christ to give me a. contempt' for worldly things; I prayed to be enabled to put earth under my feet. ., Blessings followed my prayers; .but my case required an almost hourly uplifting of the heart to ,God, and my mind was not always in a frame' to petition aright. And thus, like Christian on his way to the shining-City, I was often beset with -temptation, and fell into    DRIVE TO THE CITY.     247 snares? and wandered out of the path, to be succored and set on my way again, by the unforsaking love'of the;Divine. To aid myself in the resolution to keep from the, possibility of being tempted, shortly after my illness, I had procured-a hammer and some small nails, and fastened securely the secret drawer in the bookcase. The weakness that retained the withered bouquet, was deficient in the folly that would have made it the sub- ject of mournful contemplation and useless regret. In time I trusted to be able, if need were,I to see Ellice Manvers, whom  Kate was continually entreating me to become ac- quainted with; for she was quite bewitched about her favorite companion, and wished me to share in her partiality, with a strange blind- ness,f never guessing the feeling that caused my heart to beat with a faster throb at the mention of her name. I think had my own will been' consulted, however, the meeting would not have taken place, for I never felt calm enough to undergo a presentation to her. Accident brought us together in a most unex- pected manner.    , ' I     d 248    DRIVE7 TO THE CITY.        One day I was driven by Pierre alone to the city, in order that I might make a purchase of some scientific books for my father. The  works I wished, tot being in frequent demand, were kept in a s/mall ante-room, in the estab- lishment of Mr. iWoodwaid, from whom my father wished me to obtain them. To this room, therefore, I repaired when I entered the store, attended by one of the clerks. A lady in bonnet and shawl was seated at a small table in this apartment, making out a list of some  books that lay beside her.: She looked up at my entrance, and I noticed that she was a young and very fine-looking girl, with a striking and elegant manner, and, :though'- plainly, very rich- ; ly attired. I made my selection of books, and was about giving a direction to the waiting  clerk, when the young lady addressed him : "Will you be kind enough to-take this list  and have the bill made out? And let the books be sent to Io7 Carysford Place immedi-  ately, if possible."  ', What name?" asked the clerk.  "Miss Manvers -Miss Ellice Manvers.  Mr. Woodward will know."         I - " ";' '   .      ' "' i                . f   DRIVE TO THE CITY.     249 I turned towards her in the greatest surprise. I hardly know what my intention' was when the clerk addressed me. "Are these all the books you wish, Miss?" he said. '( Yes," I returned, "and let a receipted bill accompany them when they are placed in the carriage," and I laid a note for their payment upon the books before me. The clerk left the room.. I hesitated as I looked at Miss Manvers, who was quietly drawing on her gloves preparatory to de- parture. Would it be, proper to introduce my- self? Proper and quite  conventional I decided, but I did not act upon the decision. Coward at heart I was, worse than coward, for I thought "She calls Lawrence Esterlyn hers, and he was once mine" and it kept me silent and irresolute. Presently the clerk returned with the change from the note, for which I waited, and a request-to know my name in order to have the bill made out. Quite desperate in this emergency, I gave my name in clear, full tones, and turned with a look of expectation towards Miss Manvers. t1* . .        , ,   250    DRIVET THE CITY ? Her whole countenance beamed with a lively satisfaction as she advanced to take my out- stretched hand., "Is 'it possible?" she exclaimed; "and you are Kate Wilmerton's sister?" 'i Yes," I replied, " and you are-Ellice," She laughed musically. I could not but like her laugh. "Aht" she said, "Ellice and Bessie should not Be-utter strangers to each other." ^  "No! Kate is very fond of you," I said, simply looking at her. We examined each other. Taken feature by feature. she was not beautiful, but her face as a whole pleased and attracted. I could- not deny to her fascination and grace, and a certain cordial buoyancy gave her manner an irresisti-  ble charm. "Well! how do you find me?" she asked suddenly, with an arch smile.   ^ "Fearless and lovable,"' I returned 'half- 'bluntly. "Thank you!" she said, "I will not say what I find you. Why, I thought-Kate beau- tiful--but--no matter! And why, pray, were   DRIVE TO THE CITY.     25 you not going to speak to me? You knew my name before I did yours?" I stammered something in excuse.. " Are you jealous of me?" she interrogated with a bright smile. "' Jealous?" I repeated,' and thought, ('.Surely she cannot mean to insult me." "Aye! jealous!" she reiterated. "Afraid I shall win all Kate's love from you?" Relieved, I smiled cordially and held out my hand. "Let Kate be our bond of union," I said; " she is dear to both." She grasped my. hand warmly as she re- plied : "Yes, Bessie, we cannot but be friends, if you knew how-much Kate and I have talked of you." "And we of you," I returned; " Kate does not lack in power of description, you are aware, and I have often imagined you together in the school-room-in your apartment--in your walks'-everywhere in short, for accord- ing to her, you are inseparable." At this moment a little girl appeared in the doorway leading from the store.   252    DRIVE TO, THE CITY.  "Come, sister! I am so tired," she com- plained. : She was a faultlessly beautiful creature, and I looked at her with the greatest admiration. "Come here, Edith, and be presented to' Kate Wilmerton's sister," said Miss Manvers. "This is sister Edith, Bessie." I kissed 'the pretty fairy, and after a little * more conversation with her sister we parted, with a mutual promise of a better acqutaintance, which was not truly honest on my part, for I was half determined to avoid another meeting. This interview with Ellice Manvers did me - good. I had now the remembrance of a face '  and figure with which to connect my thoughts of Lawrence Esterlyn's betrothed, and since I  could not dislike her, since I must be ,just and admire her, I was able to acquire a certain kind of resignation when my  thoughts dwelt on her, but which was by no means perfect or even calm.   "I would not risk another meet- ing," I thought; "(I could not endure it well, or do her justice.  She and I had better be parted for this world."  After separating from  Miss Manvers, I   DRIYE TO THE CITY.     253 seated myself in the carriage for my solitary drive homeward. As Pierre put up the steps, he said with h'is easy French manner, "' Let me get you a glass of water, Miss Bes- sie; you look pale and faint i" "No, thank you, Pierre," I said, " we shall be at home soon." "a Ah, Miss," he said with an air of respect- ful concern, ' you are not so strong since your illness. Did I drive too fast from Glen- Beck?" I said no, and again thanked him,! and he mounted the box. ] When the city was eft behind, I leaned back in the carriage, and gave myself up to the cur- rent of sorrowful thought that flowed through my mind.- Suddenly the carriage stopped. A gentleman advanced from the gates of Oak- lands, before which Pierre. had drawn rein. It was Dana Poinsett., "Good-morning, Miss Wilmerton," he said as he :approached; adding, as he-perceived I was alone, "Did n6t Mildred accompany you to-day?"             ' "She was not at all well when I left her," I   254  - DRIzE TO TmE CIZTY. replied. ' She often suffers of late from head- 5 ache."              ' "Ah!" he said, and mused. Presently he I spoke again:  "This is Oaklands, Miss Wilmerton. Would ' you, not like to go over the grounds? The family have left the place.'  "I would like to go," I said. Then, after   an instant's consideration, I pleaded fatigue, and asked to be excused.          i "You can take my arm," he urged, ,and   you shall rest when you tire. You will enjoy the view of the' Wissitere from a little emi- nence toward the north."   - Alighting from the. carriage, I walked with  him. W- e looked at the view, which was fine; and then descending the little hill, he placed " me in a garden chair, and seated himself in an- i other near. Just before us a fountain sent up its tiny jet of water to the sunlight, and near it reposed the marble figure of a sleeping Silence. Beyond, through the trees were visible some  of the windows of the mansion, which now bore a  dreary, deserted look, no signs of life being apparent within or around'it. Shaded {   RIVE TO THEE CITzY.    255 [  paths led in every direction through the grounds, and to our right lay a garden, bril- liant with the flowers of this season. Towards the south there was a fine greenhouse filled with rare plants. The gardener had raised the glass of the roof here and there,'and the zephyrs wafted its fragrance towards us. "This is a pleasant home," I thought; ' Julia Kellogg must like as little to leave it as I did to say farewell to mine.'  "Miss Wilmerton," said Mr. Poinsett, "you tell me that Mildred Forrester has not been well for some time. Have you noticed a gloom and sadness about her of late?" "Yes," I said. "And have you attempted to account for it?" Again I replied in the affirmative. "Of course it is a mental trouble that causes her depression," he continued. ('I have long been sure of this." ^A mental trouble regarding a question of right and wrong," I returned. "Mr. Poinsett, Mildred is governed by high moral principle. She has received a shock."    256  -  DRIVE TO THE CRtTY. "I suspected as-much. I only wonder that  she did not experience it sooner. How did it come about?"  - I explained. "Ah!" he said, "she should have known this long before. Walworth was infatuated to suppose it possible to conceal from her a state of things like this."  "Yes," I answered, " the Talbot Bank had : too much that was dishonourable, connected with its failure, to allow of concealment for any ,length of time. The thing is impossible from its very nature." r            o "You speak very mildly, Miss Wilmerton," said Mr. Poinsett, "of what I regard "in the light of a criminal transaction. The Talbot Bank failed at a time when ing special cause existed to shake the credit or try the resources of any bank., It is well known   that the secret appropriation of its funds to the cashier's own purposes, and those of his brother, Mildred's father, was the main cause of the failure of the bank. Was this honest, to say nothing of g honor?  For my part, I cannot see the differ- A  ence between the man who cheats the many  I   DRIVE TO THE CITY.     257 with worthless bank-notes, and he who dupes unsuspecting persons with counterfeit money. The discipline of the Penitentiary, which -is awarded to the one, is needed fully as much by the other. He who, in the employ of a merchant, appropriates his master's money, meets with disgrace and a prison. The cashier of aibank who applies money entrusted to him by a confiding public, to his own uses, should be made to suffer in like measure." ' You are severe," I said, and looked at his firm mouth and the stern expression his face wore, with a feeling of the tenderest pity for Mildred. It did not seem to me likely that he would connect himself with a family he considered banned and disgraced. "Not' more severe than is needful," he returned. "Frauduilent bankruptcy, of com- panies instituted by government, should be punished with great rigor. Their insolvency involves a breach of faith to the public, especially when there is a disposal of the funds in a way prohibited by the laws. It is a grievous thing to think that our laws can be broken with impunity, or that the rights   -  258'   DRIVE To. ATE CITYS . of property are 'so illy secured or'weakly protected, that'they may be invaded and de- stroyed without redress or punishment. "It was a long time," he went on, " before I realized the extent of the crime committed, or the wrong done. We, as a' people, are accustomed to thefailure of banks. In many cases the misfortune has been the result of bad calculations and bad investments. The  insolvencyof the Talbot Bank, however, was a clearly designed fraud, and brings disgrace upon the-community where it was committed. Do not think that a city where crime of this nature has been carried on; will escape. No! Already the tidings of its shame have gone  abroad'on the wings of the wind to the cities and towns of the States, and it is judged. Are " we respected-? Are we held worthy of being ranked among honorable communities, when we allow that which should be signally punished to be passed over? Assuredly not. People in the West and in the South speak of us with a  deserved scorn. Our disgrace cannot be readily or soon forgotten," "I  have never viewed the subject thus," I \ i   DRIVE TO THE CITY.   -  59 said, " but I cannot but agree with you. The guilty do not so easily escape punishment in the New England towns and cities. Wealth there does not so well screen ill-doers." Mr. Poinsett fell into a thoughtful silence and I arose to go. - He conducted me to the carriage and held'out his hand at parting. "Mildred is very much attached to you, Miss Wilmerton," he said. "Help her, as the dreary night closes about her, to endure patiently and meekly the darkness and the chill, until the Sun shall arise and shine." I did not need to be told to manifest a sympathy for Mildred, but I liked him the better for his thought of her.   Act** ^ " ^^^r^ .   . i I - . CHAPTER   XVII. WALWORTH'S DEPARTURE-PHLIP ARRAN.

Despite the want of sympathy between them, and the rare intercourse they had  together, Mr. Forrester's pride in Walworth was very great. He took a  delight in his mere presence in the house, and in seeing him surrounded    i by polished and learned men, with whom the drawing-room at Glen-Beck was often filled, and to many of whom 'Mr. Forrester himself Pllllllaa-.rraf(+"-      : ' . i   WALWORTIP S DEPAR TURE.   -261 was totally unknown. He was a person who had few attachments, but when he once gave of his affection, it was in no stinted measure ; and I could not but feel the deepest sorrow for this man, when a blow came for which he was ill prepared.

Mr. Forrester ap- preached the table at which I sat, and counted out some bank-notes which he pushed towards Walworth. Immediately after, summoned by Mrs. Forrester, he left the apartment. Wal- worth didnot take the money from the table, but stationed himself near one of the windows I and looked gloomily out. I continued my reading; for Walworth's moods were not un- known to me, and I had of late acquired a habit of leaving him alone unless he addressed me, for the. restless dissatisfaction in his face was more apparent than ever. At length he moved slowly towards the table; I raised my eyes from the book and observed him. There was a dark, scornful expression in his counte- nance, a determined compression of the lip, that gave me pain to mark.    262   W WALWORTH'S DEPARTURE. "Bessie," he said, touching the money with one of his fingers, " these, and some thou- sands beside, should be your father's by right, if there was justice in our laws, or honor among men.  What do you think has become of Nemesis, Bessie?" I did not answer. Placed in a difficult posi- j tion silence was best. "Shall I' take this money?" he continued. "Shall I spend for my own use and pleasure  what you anl others have been despoiled of'? Never! So help me God! I He ground his teeth and. walked rapidly back and forth through the room. "( But Walworth," I said," there is no need. You are a man, and God has gifted you with  talent and energy. Use these aright. The 'laborer is worthy of his hire.' Work!" "To what purpose?" he inquired. "To no earthly one," I replied. "When did' earth ever afford fruition? ' "When indeed?" he repeated bitterly. "Sooner or later we re'alize the nature of A- earth's joys," I went on. "You are not igno- rant of this. And," I continued, looking up     .   d.    e .

For some time I have been aware that you have for life, a plan; for its days, work; for its close, the prospect of a rest well-won. Is it not so, Walworth?" He did not answer immediately, and I added, ," What,have you decided to do?" His eye blazed, his form grew erect, he up- lifted his hands. "To go forth empty-handed on my way, without, purse or scrip, or any such thing. To earn my bread before I eat it. To lie no longer softly, and fare sumptuously. To be', an honest beggar, if it must come to that.'" "It will'never come to that," I said. "And before long you will discover the end of our existence here." "Tell me, Bessie." "To gain Christ," was my reply. A reverent look rested on his features. "I hope to realize this erelong;"- he returned. "Truly, I need something beyond earth and time." "   264   WALWORTH'S DEPARTURE. I arose and stretched out my hand. "Christ aid you!"I said; "Christ keep you! I give you a God-speed to your journey's end." He did not take my hand, but moved partly away. The next instant a wild look crossed  his brow, and turning he clasped me in his  arms. "Dearest A Bessie," he whispered hoarsely, "I leave 11 that I prize in life be- 'hind-but I go. Farewell." And the places that knew Walworth Forres- ter knew him no more. He left Glen-Beck and accepted a professorship in the University  of M--, iwhere he had been educated, and i but once again during his father's life crossed the threshold of his home. !  To describe that, father's inordinate and .! almost insane rage and grief at this proceeding on his son's part, is beyond my power. He was for a ti'me- unfitted for his daily occupa- -tions, and spent many hours of each day in ; walking up and down the shaded paths among ;I the trees, or pacing the floor of his own room.  His countenance expressed an ire and a dis- content, and his whole manner indicated a j   WAL WORTH'S DEPARTURE.   265 gloomy wrath very: disagreeable to witness. No one, not even Mildred, dared approach him in this mood, and he was left to entire sol-  itude; for Mrs. Forrester was judicious enough to refrain from speaking words of consolation while grief was at its flow. Walworth wrote at his' departure to both his parents and to Mildred. What he said to the former I do not know. It. isprobable that he dealt plainly and spoke the truth, giving can- didly his reasons for his conduct; for Wal- worth did not lack moral power to; say what. he thought right. -The "Nathan'f was come at last for Mr. Forrester,. - Thou art the man!" a voice whispered, and he might not turn away.  Truly, a conscience free from blame is a blessed thing in-sorrow! The day of Walworth's departure, Mildred came to me with his letter to her open in her hand. She had been weeping; and-when she spoke with me tears and sobs interrupted her speech. "Bessie," she said, "Walworth tells me in this to come to you; that you will understand better than any one else the reasons of his 12  266   WALWORT'-S DEPARTURE. departure-the necessity for the step he has, taken. ' Go toBessie for sympathy and com- fort, he says; and Bessie, I have come " I did not attempt to console her at first.. Of a truth, I was too much grieved' at Wal- worth's. abrupt departure and its consequences, to speak' perhaps calmly or well. I had been aware by a sort of intuition for some days past that he intended something of this kind-- for I understood his disposition anrid charac- ter well enough by this time to. guess in a measure his intentions-and his conversation with me did not surprise me much. But his sudden loss was great, and the sorrow in the household deep and bitter. It is no matter of - wonder, then, that I was dumb to Mildred for, a space; she was sitting beside me, her face buried in her hands, sobbing violently. : "He does not mean to return," she said. "Oh, who will be to me what he-has been?l How can I live here without him? He says I must rely on myself. I have no self-reliance. It was cruel to leave me just when I began to need him most."' "If you suffer, Mildred," I said, "Wal- l ---- -   WALWORTH'S DEPARTURE.    267 worth suffers also. Think of what his decision must cost him."' "Bessie, did you uphold him in that deci- sion?" she asked suddenly. "I cannot but applaud it," I returned, " for it seems to me right; but, Mildred, Walworth's mind was made up weeks ago, if I have any judgment or knowledge of his character." She paused awhile thinking. "Ah well " she said- " after all, Walworth is right. 'He is a man. When men find them- selves surrounded by circumstances disagree- able and vexatious, not to say difficult of control, they free themselves at once and com- pletely, as Walworth has done. But women are compelled under all circumstances, bear- able and unbearable, to remain outwardly quiescent. No step like Walworth's would free tme. It would only bring added trouble. Endurance is early forced upon the. sex. Alas! how may I learn calmly to endure?"  "Yes, Walworth is right," she went on. "For months past he has spent no money, and his dress has been as paias  s a charity student's.

His. own conduct must be - blameless, whatever that of others may be. He has been, he is, quite right. But oh, what  must I do? What should I do? I feel all that -he has felt. He might at least have ad- vised me before he went from us."  Poor Mildred! she was very miserable. "It seems to me, dear Mildred," I said after a short silence, "that what you say about 'endurance being early forced upon our sex, is very true. Weaker, quieter, more fearful gen- erally, than man, we yield silently and with a better grace to trouble than he; because, though we may have the courage, we have, not the physical strength, nor perhaps the' i daring energy, ith which our brothers seek to overcome the impediments in their path.^ - "Yes, and they do overcome," she repliea,  "and in any ca-se are happier for the contest :                    ," i II   ,s7   WAXLWORTHS' DEPARTURE.    269 The necessity for action employs and stimu-? lates their minds. What if new troubles arise in their path? With every encounter they grow wiser, until finally the active struggle with difficulties is not without a certain enjoy- ment for them. Oh Bessie! it is inactivity. that I dread. I am not naturally patient. I could bear up under sorrow better, if my daily life was a conflict,'even if labor with my hands was necessary to give me bread. Hon- estly, though ever so hardly earned, food would be sweet to me, and toil would bring its own blessing." I saw what her case required: Mildred needed employment. But, the daughter of a millionnaire, how might she use her energies in a way that would not call down the censure and malice of the world? She wasta woman, and the sex are hardly judged if they seek in active pursuits relief from sorrow or a morbid discontent. Suddenly a thought struck me. I had long been wishing to speak with Mil- dred about little Philip Arran. "Mildred," I said at once, "'what are' you going to do about lame Philip?" **'***"=NiA--^ ---M------  -  . .... i .   270   WAL WORTTH'S DEPARTURE.

I re- 'plied ; and leaving the apartment; I repaired to that occupied as the school-room, unlocked and took from -my'esk a composition which lame Philip had handed- me the -day before, and returned with it to Mildred. Philip had I been very much impressed by a well-written article in the London Times, on the condition of Europe, then in a ferment of revolution and convulsed with strife, which was to end for  ,few in the freedom, for which they struggled. j He had quoted for his subject two lines from ^' the strongly worded article.

"Have you work enough, Mildred?"I asked.         "Oh, Bessie!" she e:claimed, pausing in her walk to throw her arms impulsively about me, " how shall I ever be able to" thanks- you for this? Your suggestion shows me my duty and gives me employment. Walworth did right to send me to you.' Mildred did not hesitate long in the. per- formance of what she  considered right. Philip Arran was removed from Andy Ray's care and given an upper room, near that of Tommy, who was now judged old enough to leave the nursery and occupy an apartment of his own. No objection was made to this ar- rangement. Both her parents would have gratified the most extravagant whim of Mil- dred's, and this seemed no extraordinary pro- ceeding, for the boy was a favorite with the whole household. Philip took his meals with the children, and said his ordinary lessons with them as usual. 12*  '  *    ' -   ,  ^   274   W WALWORT H'S DEPAR TURE. In the afternoon of three days'in the week he went to Mildred to recite-from his Latin and French grammar, and read some fine poem or cholce old English essay, which both teacher and ipupil discussed afterward with taste -and  enjoyment, for, as I have said, Philip was gifted with rare discrimination and a love for the heroic and beautiful, uncommon as it was enthusiastic.   ' So the days flew busily on, and Mildred and her protege grew strongly attached to each -other. A visible change was taking place in -lame Philip.' It was not likely that he would ever grow much taller, but he no longer looked sickly and puny: the crimson of health was on his cheek, and his step, though he halted a little, was firm and strong. Physically, he was greatly benefited; intellectually, he was mak- ing rapid strides to excellence. I remember -one or two conversations held with him at this time, which astonished  and delighted me. "There is even more promise about' the lad than'I at first thought," I said to Mildred one day, while I   lingered in her room. She smiled, and-going to her bureau, took from a   WALWORTH'S DEPARTURE.    275 small, locked drawer, a Savings Bank book, and pointed to an entry made in Philip's name for a thousand dollars. "I did not mean to tell any one just yet," she said, "' but I can trust you, Bessie. There are my diamond necklace and ear-rings in another shape. It will do -more good in Philip's education than it, ever did when in the form of glittering jewelry; it made me the envy of one-half my lady acquaintances." "But will your parents approve?"I asked, aghast at the exchange that had been made. "I do not anticipate any blame from them," she returned. "Uncle Erastus gave me the necklace and ear-rings. The pin and bracelet which my mother obtained to match them I have not parted with. In any case, Bessie, I feel that I have done right." And thus lame Philip's future education was provided for. The "poet," Mildred and I had named him in our hearts.   CHAPTER    XVIII. CONVERSATION WITH THE CHLDREN-COL- ONEL -AICHESON.0- Fests.--' It is not love Bluings sorrow, but love's objects."

Lillian was seated on my knee, twining the long, front locks of my hair into curls. It was a favorite amusement with her, and she had a habit of murmuring  "Bessie, Bessie," under her breath while her hands were busy with my hair. At all other . times she called me Miss Wilmerton. Tommy and Frank sat at my feet. They were talking of their brother Walworth's departure. "Papa looks so cross," said Frank, ' that I ------A------^ ..--             '    COLONEL AICHESON.    2" did not like to a k him why brother went away. I asked mamma." "And what did- mamma say?." inquired Lillian. "Oh, she cried until I could not bear to look at her any more, and so I ran away to Mildred. She was crying too, but she put her arms about me and told me that brothers often left their homes when they grew to be men; that papa did not stay in4 his father's house, but got one of his own'; and that Tommy and I would do so too, some day, when we became strong and tall."  "Yes," said Tommy, " when I am grown, I mean to make money, and build a much finer house than this. I shall be a cashier, and rich as the Rothschilds, those Jew bankers brother Walworth told us about one day." "I shall not care half so much about my drawing, now brother is gone," said Frank with a dejected air. "I thought he would be so pleased with my sketch of the iceberg and the wrecked ship. I took ever so much pains with the water and sky just to please him, and now he won't care."    278  -   COLONEL AICESON..  'He will care, Frank," I asserted. "He loves you all very much, and would be grieved did you cease to do well." 1 "He will forget us," contradicted Tommy; "I should, I know.  In the city men have something  else to think of 'besides their brothers and sisters  they leave at home. When I am with papa in M--, I never think of any'of you., e'ven mamma."           "Oh, Tommy! exclaimed Lillian.  "' Facts are stubborn things,' I heard papa say yesterday," he returned.  "That's what I call a. stubborn fact."  "Tommy! oh, how   selfish!" cried both Frank and Lillian, in a breath. "   Do you never forget about me?*" he asked, half sneeringly. "Not for a whole day," asserted Frank. "No! not even for half a one," said Lillian. "When you go to M--   with papa, I think of you often, and, always like to know when- you are to come back."       ^   ' Tommy whistled.   It was a habit he in- dulged in on all occasions and when under the influence of various dispositions. When-he    COLONEL AICHESON.       279 was glad he whistled, and when he was sorry; and I always knew when a process of calcula- tion was going on in his mind, by a prolonged but suppressed whistling, which did not end until the problem, whatever it happened'to be, was solved to his own satisfaction. His les- sons in arithmetic were recited with interjec- tional whistles, which accompanied the work- ing out of his sums, whether mentally or with pencil and slate. I had striven, but unsuc- cessfully, to break him of this habit. There was a little pause after Tommy's inter-  lude of whistling ended. "If you think your brother Walworth has forgotten you, or is in danger of forgetting you," I said, "you are greatly mistaken. Only to-day he sent froIn M--, a box for you, and when Philip returns it shall be opened. - It is now under the little work-table in my room." ; Tommy and Frank immediately entreated to be allowed to bring it to the nursery, to be ready against Philip's coming; and when I consented, they ran away'together for it. "Brother will not forget us; he' has our daguerrotypes," said Lillian. . daguerrot es, ,  A  s            280    COLONEL AICHESON. "Has he-?"I 'said. "Yes, and yours too" she continued, twin- ing the curls lightly round her fingers. "I saw yours in a little box by itself." "What! my daguerrotype!"2 I exclaimed, in the utmost astonishment.. "Yes, Miss Wilmerton, I saw it last Sab- bath afternoon. Brother Walworth was walk- ing in the garden with mamma, and I went to his room to get some cologne from his bureau, and I saw one of the little drawers that are always locked, open, -with the key in it; and so , I peeped in, and in a little box inside was your daguerrotype, snug and safe. When. I heard brother Walworth coming, I shut the drawer up quick and ran away. A- Btt I met him in the hall, and went back with him to his room, and then I told him about my looking in the drawer." "And what did he say?"I asked, with not ' .a little curiosity. "He walked fast up and down the room," she returned, " and .I did not like I had been so naughty, for his face looked sorry. In a little while he stopped, and. took me in his IL+/              ' #- - -EaE    COLONvEL AICHESON.    281 arms, and made me promise -not to tell any one about the daguerrotype : and he said he would see if I could keep a secret." "And are you keeping it now?"I in- quired with severity '"Oh, you knew all about it; it was your daguerrotype," she replied, full of surprise. I,Was Silent.'    -    : "Miss Wilmerton," she continued earnestly, "do you think a little girl cannot keep a se- cret? I am very sure I should not tell what- brother Walworth did not want me to; not  even if they pinched me with red-hot pincers, as they did the old martyrs you read to us about the other day." "I do believe that you can keep a secret," I said, and kissed the sweet face upturned to mine. At this moment Philip, returned from a drive  to M  with Mildred, entered,- followed by Tommy and Frank, carrying the box, which was opened with Tommy's aid, who used his small hammer and chisel to some purpose. It contained presents'for all the children, -well. suited to the taste of each. * ' n . ^                 H---    ' *'  282   ' COLONEL AICHESON. "Who will say now," I interrogated, "that there is a likelihood of your brother Wal- worth's forgetting you? The selection of these gifts proves that he remembers accu- rately your different dispositions and wants. Trust me, you will forget Walworth before he forgets you." And now no one contradicted the assertion. I took with :me to my room that night a thought that troubled and perplexed me. The purloiner of the missing daguerrotype was discovered at last. What should I do under the-circumstances, I queried. I re- flected long,: but came to no decision. Kate arrived atGlen-Beck early the next morning -for a day's visit. I sought counsel from her. "Kate," I began, "Walworth Forrester has  my daguerrotype." "Well," she replied, quite coolly, "that fact does not surprise me. And you have Walworth's."  I looked at her, too amazed for speech. "Why, Bessie," she went on'laughing gayly, do you suppose that I have lost sight and hearing? Long ago I knew that Waiworth   COL ONiEL AICHESON.    283 loved you. I saw it in his eye when he looked at you, and-heard it in his tones when he ad- dressed you, andit made me very happy to know it."  ,  ( Happy!"I repeated, scarce knowing that I heard-aright. "Yes," she answered.   "Walworth is every way worthy of you, sister. With your views so in harmony, you cannot failto go through life happily together. Lawrence Es- terlyn was more like a brother than a lover. I always said so to mamma. Walworth For- rester is more truly your mate. Bessie, I give you joy." I burst into tears. How true it is that our kindred and friends, know little of what passes beneath the surface of our outward life. So long as ,no explana- tion is offered, no callfor sympathy made-if the behavior is quite tranquil, the eye un- suffused, and the voice calm, the heart may break in silence, unsuspected of a throbbing and enduring agony, over which Will pre- serves calmness and a certain indifferent bear- ing to: the last. Kate was convinced that   284    COLONEL AICHESON.       * Lawrence Esterlyn was now nothing to me; that Walworth Forrester had my heart with promise of my-hand, Oh! the task of dis- abusing her mind of this belief! I did not tell her that I'still hopelessly loved Lawrence; this was needless; but I found her very stub- ' born about Walworth. She could not or would not believe that he was, only a friend in my estimation. At length I rather sharply  asserted. that Walworth " could not marry me if he did love me. ' "And why, pray?" she asked. "Because," I replied;." Walworth Forres- -ter will never ask any woman whom he re- spects enough to marry, to share his home or  bear his name. It is my belief he will never ,wed. With his fine sensibility, he feels daily l more and more keenly the shame of. his father's disgrace." "But Walworth is not involved" in it,'; she asserted. "Indirectly he feels himself to be so," I answered. "The name of Forrester is re- peated with a shrugor a sneer when men talk. of honor in financial affairs, and it is known   COLONEL AICHESON.     285' wide and far. Mr. Forrester's children will feel this more than he yet seems to have done. Wrong-doing is punished, even in this world, Kate." "(And the innocent are made to- suffer!" she exclaimed. "Oh, Bessie! is it just that Walworth and Mildred, and your three pupils, shall be thus punished for their father's fault?" "I answer your question, Kate, by asking another. Has, not the punishment already begun?"  And she could not'deny it. 'But after convincing her that no engage- ment existed between Walworth and myself, I could obtain no advice from Kate in regard to the daguerrotype. She was utterly at a loss what to suggest, and I finally came to the con- clusion, little as I liked'to have it remain in hist possession, to make no application to Walworth for it. And Kate applauded my resolution. Colonel Aicheson accompanied IKate and myself to the city. It was my wish to go to M--  with Kate, and return with Mrs. For- rester and Mildred, who were not expected home until. evening; and the Colonel, who   286    COL ONEL AICHESON. happened to call as .we were about deciding to go in the stage that ran hourly between the village of Moreton and the city, offered us a' seat in his carriage. When we "reached Madame Merillat's, Kate begged me to step into the hall a moment, until she obtained our  mother's last letter to her, which she wished me to read. The Colonel assisted us to alight from the carriage, and at Kate's invitation both he and I t6ok seats in the wide saloon, upon one side of which the doors of the large school-room. opened, and those of Madame Merillat's reception-room on the other. One school-room door was partly open, and we ! heard a clear, sweet voice within say :- , ! "Oh Kate! Why did you not tell mp Colonel Aicheson accompanied you from   8 Glen-Beck? His brave conduct at Monterey made him famous. I should so have liked to see him ' -      '  The Colonel gave me an amused look. "It j is a pity I cannot be presented to the young ! lady," he said.

When I appeared, she made a movement towards -me, but glanced apprehensively into the hall, beyond. Kate had evidently informed her that the object of her curiosity was within. ear-shot. "Miss Manvers," I saiid, "since Madame does not permit strangers to enter the school- room, will you not. step to the threshold to see me?" The Colonel was at my side in an instant. Miss Manvers' cheeks became'crimson as she approached. "Kate did. not tell me you were here,-" she said simply, looking much embarrassed.' I immediately presented her to the Colonel, who entered into  conversation with' her.- They were a fine-looking pair as they stood thus together, and H could not avoid sighing. as I looked at Ellice., "She is beautiful," ,I thought, " and worthy of Lawrence, for she is noble too."         '     , When we were seated again in the carriage, . the Colonel said,            "a8br.1^1^^sasua A            *   288    coLONEL AICHESOr.    ; "Your school-girl, Miss Wilmerton, makes every soldier a hero. Miss Manvers is a charming girl. I was 'much amused by her naivete." We drove to the place where I expected to find Mrs. Forrester and Mildred, but they had, been some time gone. "You will be compelled to go back to, Glen- Beck with me," said the Colonel, with a smile, remarking my look of perplexity. "Come, Miss Wilmerton, it is evident you will have to accept my company for lack of better."' When we reached Glen-Beck, Poulett ap- peared with a message. "Mrs. Forrester's compliments, and 'would :Colonel Aicheson come in to dinner?" The Colonel would, and we were presently seated, a very cheerful party, at the dinner- table, where -to-day Mr. Forrester's seat was vacant, he having been detained in the cityon business. 'The Colonel seated himself next Mildred, -and during the meal had neither eye nor ear for any one beside. When we rose from table, Mrs. Forrester exclaimed about the beauty of the moon just rising   COLONEL AICHESON.     289 above the mountain tops, and visible through the uncurtained window. "What a lovely. night for a walk!" exclaimed Mildred. The Colonel said something to her which I did not hear. "Come, mamma; come, Bessie,", she said, (" we will take the garden-paths down to the Monoskisy." Mrs. Forrester could not go, and I begged to be excused until I had read my mother's letter to Kate. The Colonel looked his satis- faction. There was no alternative but for Mildred to accompany him, but I saw she did so with great reluctance. My letter perused, I walked for a space up and down the piazza, until I was chilled by the evening air: then recollecting that Mildred had gone out without the scarf she usually- wore in the open air at this season, I went to my room, procured a shawl for her and myself, and -took my way rapidly through the -garden to the banks of the small stream. The Colonel- and Mildred stood near the water's 13   290    9COLONEL A1CHESON. edge. His voice was raised in earnest entreaty, and I heard him say as I approached, "Oh Mildred! is my-love nothing to you, then?" I observed her withdraw the hand which he attempted to take, but I did not hear her reply. I only guessed it, when I saw his agitated face as I drew near. "Mildred," I said, "a mist is on all 'the 'hills, and the air is chill. I have brought you a shawl. " ' Thank you, Bessie," she returned. "I do feel chilly. Let us return." On our way back through the garden, the Colonel made some remarks about the flowers, which, though the season was late, 'still bloomed brilliantly; but gloom, not to be dis- pelled by any like attempts at conversation which either Mildred or I made, hung over us, and all were relieved when we reached the house.  "I saw Pierre but now go towards the stables," said the Colonel.. "He will procure my carriage for me. Miss Forrester, Miss Wilmerton, I will take leave of you here."    COLONEL AICHESO..    A 29I Bidding him good-evening, I ascended the ,steps of the piazza. I saw him take Mildred's (hand, which she gave reluctantly, in both his own and raise it to his lips. Then turning away he proceeded rapidly to the stables. On entering the drawing-room, after going to my room   to restore my shawl to -its drawer, I found Mildred seated beside a table, e with an open book Before her. I did not address her, but, seating myself at the piano, I played some old airs my mother had taught me when I was a mere child. Turning once ' or twice to look at Mildred, .I saw that she was weeping quietly. The page over which her head was bent was quite wet with tears. Mrs. Forrester had not yet made Iher appear- ance, and I played softly on, well knowing that the, flow of these tears would do Mildred good. After a space there was a slight bustle in the hall, and presently visitors were an- nounced. I turned to look for Mildred, but she had-vanished. Mrs. Forrester entertained her guests, that evening, alone. The next day Mildred spent with Mrs. Grey. Towards evening I walked down to the    T        ..i...-IiQi*i,.,I I ill-.,..l ' I 1 1 i I I -I-iiiiii i 8 iii... . ,l ., '..,'.,: M il j 292 \   COLONEL AICHESON. farm, for I had promised her' to come at sun- set. Mrs. Grey was in the garden with her favorite. "I'have just been persuading Miss Milly -to stay a few days with me," she said, as I approached.. "Lame Philip is to bring his books; and you, Miss Bessie, will come every day to see us, will you not?" I promised, glad to have her make the change for a time, certain that the example of Mrs. Grey's daily life and. conversation, so thoroughly cheerful, by reason ,of her calm, -earnest faith and religious view of all things, could not fail to benefit Mildred. Colonel Aicheson came no more to Glen- Beck, and Dana Poinsett's visits had ceased with Walworth's departure. The conversation of the circle that now met at Glen-Beck had become "stale, flat, and unprofitable" to me. I sought the drawing-room seldom now, and Mildred was with difficulty persuaded by her mother to enter it. She infinitely preferred E the society of the children and Lame Philip  to that of those who called themselves her friends,       .     I   CHAPTER XIX. "TO MAKE IDOLS, AND TO FIND THEM CLAY."

WHEN    the  cold  winds of  November came, we   removed to the city, for the family this year were later than- usual in  leaving  Glen-Beck.  Mildred,   could  she have had   her choice, would have preferred   to remain at Glen-Beck     the year round, for the city, with its whirl and   bustle and distracting gayety, was become     distasteful to her.  This   294     TO MAKZE IDOLS,    . could not be, however, and we were soon set- tled for the winter in Carysford Place, where Mr. Forrester's splendid residence fronted on a fine park, which was filled with tall trees, and where on pleasant days a fountain sent up its waters to meet the sunlight. The interior of the mansion was furnished in a style of great magnificence, for the rare taste that .had adorned Glen-Beck had prevailed here also, and the pictures and statuary were valuable and beautiful. - As Mildred went -with me through the different rooms, she pointed out various articles which Walworth had brought from Europe, and spoke with tears of the peace of a past period, when Walworth and she were as happy as youth, and wealth, and lack of trouble could make them. This past was all of pleasure that remained to her now. lHere," she said, as we seated ourselves in the boudoir adjoining her mother's room, "Dana Poinsett and Walworth read German with me when I first began the study:. Ah, - those were happy times!"' and -the sigh that followed these words was suppressed with a visible effort.             A   TO MAKE IDOLS.     295 One of Mildred's first acts, on coming to re- side in the city, was to seek and obtain an in- terview with Walworth. Hitherto all her ef- forts to see him had proved unavailing. He was never at home when she called; often when'she had driven to the city with no other purpose than to see'him. Now, however, she was more successful. She told me she had found him looking pale and thin, but that much of the old dissatisfied look was gone, and he was in reality happier than he had been in some time. "He asked particularly after you, Bessie,'" she said, "and you are to drive out every day with me. I promised him this. I am to take care that you do not grow, ill with -too much confinement."     - -"The same kind, thoughtful Walworth," I said. "But are his present duties pleasant, Mildred?"  "Very," she replied. "He could not him- self have chosen more agreeable tasks. And I do believe," she continued, " that it is no hardship for him to live in those scantily fur- nished rooms at the university*; and yet you are aware, Bessie, with what elegancies: his   296     TO MAKE IDOLS. taste would lead him to surround himself. Dear brother! his-will and strength of mind ennoble his poverty. I would willingly do likewise." The distractions of her city life prevented Mildred from giving as much time as usual to Philip Arran, and fearing to hinder his prog- ress, which was becoming more marked. every day, she decided, after a little hesitation, to place him with Mr. Irving, the pastor of the church at Moreton, who was to prepare the boy for college. The parting with her pupil cost ,both herself and him a painful struggle, but she was convinced it would be for his ultimate benefit. She placed in Mr. Irving's hands Philip's bank-book, and directed that in case of her absence. or death, the means therein contaihed should be used to defray the ex- penses of his education. But it must remain Ta untouched so long as she was able herself to drive out once or twicea week to visit him, and receive from Mr. Irving a report of his progress. Mildred kept the promise. she had made her  brother. I was taken for a drive every after- 1   TO MAKE IDOLS. -.    297 noon, and sometimes of a morning, often sorely against my will, for the- children's reci- tations were necessarily shortened by her de- cision to go out earlier,*: and for a longer drive than! usual. One day, when we were out together, she ordered Pierre to drive to Mr. Everett's, an artist of some note, who had painted her por- trait the preceding winter, and where it ,still- remained, since some alteration which. he pro- posed making had not been accomplished. "I wish you to see it, Bessie," she said. "It is thought a very good likeness." In ascending the stairs which led to the room where the finished paintings were kept; Mildred complained of a slight faintness. "I will lie down and rest a little," she said, (" for I feel quite at home here; " and having pointed out to me her own portrait, she raised a dam- ask curtain that separated the apartment filled with paintings from one adjoining, used by Mrs'. Everett as! a drawing-room, and finding it tenantless, laid down upon a sofa which was placed near the entrance. 'I rang the bell, and having procured from the servant   ..                ^ ^^^^  298     TO MAKE IDOLS. answering my summons a glass of water for Mildred, I left her, and repaired to the other apartment. Mildred's portrait did not quite please me. The forehead was not quite clear enough, the eyes were not deep enough, nor was the mouth sufficiently sweet;, and yet it was a very fine painting and a good likeness. Hers was an uncommon and exceeding beauty, and the painter had copied the fair lineaments well; but what I missed was the spiritual expression, that gave her face its peculiar charm. "Per-'i haps it is impossible to give this expression to canvas," I thought; and after looking at the other paintings, some of which were very fine, Iparted. the 'curtain, 'and entered the quiet' room where Mildred lay, as yet undisturbed. Her eyes were 'closed, and as, she seemed to sleep, I took a. book from a table near, and seating myself beside her, read for some time in silence. The entrance 'of some persons in the painting room drew my attention from the page, and presently a familiar voice struck my ear. It was that of Mr. Poinsett; I could not be mistaken, for he had a peculiar habit of em-   TO MAKE IDOLS.      - 299 phasizing certain words when conversing. "Is not that Dana Poinsett?-" asked Mildred, half- rising from her recumbent posture, and listen- ing. ' Yes," I replied. "Who is with him?" she inquired. "I cannot tell," I answered ; "I do not think I ever heard the voice before. Do you recog- nize it?" We listened, but Mr. Poinsett only spoke. at any length. His companion seemed to be engaged in the, examination of the paint- ings. Presently we heard an exclamation, and then Mr, Poinsett was questioned. - "' Poinsett, what a divine face! Beautiful.! Beautiful Can it be a portrait?" "It is a likeness of Miss Forrester," we heard Mr. Poinsett reply. "Forrester! What Forrester?" "Mr. Stephen Forrester, cashier of the Ros- situr Bank, is, the lady's father; you saw him ' but now at the Exchange."' "What! not that old knave's daughter.! I have no respect for that man, Poinsett."   300 /    rTo MAKE IDOLS. There was a pause. Then the stranger spoke again: "I cannot tell you what feelingsithe contem- plation of this face gives me.

Who would wish to en- tail upon innocent children a history such as her father's and uncle's has been?" "Who indeed?" was Mr. Poinsett's sole rejoinder, and a moment after we heard the sound of departing footsteps in the hall and de- scendihg the stairs. Oh, this was hard! this was bitter! Mil- dred's youth and beauty and goodness stood her in no stead. I looked at her. :The blood was eddying back and forth in her cheeks, her lips were pressed firmly together, and the erect, roused, listening attitude was not relinquished for some seconds after the distant voices and departing footsteps were no longer audible.   TO MAIE IDOIS.      30I I withdrew quietly to the other apartment, and left her to struggle with her anguish alone. I, paced up and down the solitary room in agitated meditation. Mildred was evidently rejected by him whom she loved, and for no fault of her own. I knew andfelt this as she realized it. Stern in his judgments and firm in his resolves as I knew Dana Poinsett to be, I had yet hoped through all that the winning 'beauty and gentle worth and noble qualities of my dear companion would conquer in the end, and that happiness would yet be hers, for I had great faith in the power of love to set aside, objections or to overcome obstacles. But now Mr. Poinsett's opinion was declared in the half-ejaculatory reply he made to his friend. Mildred's doom was spoken, and i had not the courage to question what strength or hope would carry her through the coming years. In the midst of my sorrowful reflections, I heard a step in the adjoining room; a hand parted the curtains and a white face looked through. "Bessie, it grows late; shall we not re- turn?"   '     ------- ------^^           a 302     7 To MAKE IDOLS. "Yes, Mildred," I said, and we descended the stairs and entered the carriage, which at this moment drove to the entrance. She drew close the folds of her veil, and we were driven home;in silence. In a for'night .from this time, so great was the change in Mildred's 'appearance, that her parents became alarmed and sent for a physi- cian, who prescribed travel and amusement. Mrs. Forrester immediately. prepared to ac- company -her daughter in a journey to the South, which was projected for her benefit. They were to be gone until after the holidays, and I hoped that the length of her stay, and the -change of scene, would effect at least a partial restoration. The night'before her departure, I sought Mildred's apartment. I found her in a loose wrapper, sitting in an easy-chair that was drawn beside the bed.  Her hands were clasped before her, and as she turned to look ' at me, a dreary smile lighted her face. "Mildred,' I said, taking a shawl that lay across the chair-back, and placing it upon her shoulders, t" you do wrong to expose yourself   TO0 MAKE IDOLS.     303 thus; the night is very, cold, and you have no fire." , She sighed. J  '  "I miss Nurse Matty so much," she said presently. Her childish griefs had been soothed by this tender foster-mother--at a later period she had no concealments from her; it was but natural she should long to rest her head upon her faithful bosom now. t a Why not send for Mrs, Grey?"I asked. "Let her accompany you in your journey." I cannot be so selfish as to ask her to leave her son," she answered. "Nurse Matty can- not be spared from the farm." We sat silent for a space, then she said: "All day to-day the last German poem we read together has been running in my mind. These lines constantly recur to me. O Mutter, Mutter! -hin ist hin! Verloren ist verloren ;- : Der Tod, der Tod, ist mein Gewinn, O war' ich nie geboren!'  The poor forsaken Fraulein! Bessie, do you         .

"And when tempted beyond endurance and all self-control, how are we to live?' she asked. I was kneeling beside her. Taking her clasped hands in my own, I prayed : Oh, Christ! Deliverer! and Intercessor! Thou art 'no morb in the world, but we are in the world.' 'Keep us from the evil. Sanctify us through Thy truth. Thy word is truth.' Give us patience and faith!" After a silence, Mildred said : .  "Bessie, will you let me have your i Kem- pis until my return?" I arose and sought the little volume in my room, and placing it in her hands, quietly withdrew.  Mildred returned to M--  with her mother, after, an absence of two months, but little changed in her appearance, and professing' herself wearied of travel and longing for rest.   TO MAKE IDOLS.      305 The evening of her return, Mr. -Poinsett, who had visited me twice or thrice during her; absence, called, and was beside us in the drawing-room, before we were aware of his presence. There was a hurry and confusion in Mildred's manner as she turned to receive him neither he nor I failed to mark. The fatigue of the journey, and the excitement caused by meeting Mr. Poinsett would, I feared, prove too much for her in her present state, but I could not urge her to withdraw, and I' noticed the flush on her cheek with an uneasiness I could not conceal. "The hours and days that will succeed this encounter with Mr. Poinsett will- have an added suffering, by reason of the troubled delight of this inter- view;"I thought. "Oh, how will she find strength to unclasp her arms from her idol and turn away? The blinding tears as they fall will hide the cross from her view. How or when will her -vision become clear? Barren- ,ness, where reigned beauty; chill, where spread warmth; darkness, where light was given- earth is' to her now but the burial-place of a. hope that perished months ago."   These   306     So MA'-E IDOLS.  dreary reflections occupied me when I looked at and listened toi her as she sat beside Mr. Poinsett, beautiful and animated beyond her wont. In the course of the'evening Mr. Poinsett asked Mildred to sing an old ballad-song she had learned for him when she was a school- girl. Sing it," she said, " no! I cannot! Bes- sie will sing it for you." But when in answer to Wis appeal to me, I turned over the leaves of a music-stool to find the song, she said ab- ruptly: "Pardon me, Bessie, I will sing it for Mr. Poinsett; i" and, with^ a strange glitter in her eye, she sat down to the instrument, and sang the sad words set to a mournful air, with a 'pathos and sweetness that melted one to tears. Mr. Poinsett looked uneasy and troubled, and followed her movements -anxiously, until he saw that I was observing him. When it grew late, Mrs. Forrester entered to insist upon Mildred's withdrawal. She rose 'to obey, and when Mr. Poinsett's hand was Xextended to take hers as she bade him good-   TO MAKE IDOLS.      307 night, she merely bowed over it; and withdrew  with .her mother. "Miss Wilmerton," said Mr. Poinsett ap- proaching me,. " do you consider 'Mildred -much benefited by her journey?" "No," I said ; " she is evidently no better." "( Has the physician given her ailment a name?" he asked. "I think not," I replied. "Ought not something to be done, and immediately?" he interrogated. "Do you think her in danger, Mr. Poinsett? that she is seriously ill?"I inquired. "I have long had fears for her." "Then, Miss Wilmerton, she should have advice at once." His manner was alarmed and eager. "Mr. Poinsett," I exclaimed suddenly and passionately, "what has Mildred in life worth living for,? The work her willing hands seek to do is denied her by reason of her father's wealth. I ask you, if life is precious or pleas- ant to her? What need has she of drugs and cordials to arrest disease, and restore her failing strength?

"Ever since her discovery of the disgrace attached to her father's name," I went on;  'and since Walworth's departurie, she has Were the power mine, I would fold pitying arms about her and lift her out of the shadow surrounding her, and remove the weight that is pressing the vitality from her heart.

When I retired to my room, I did not-feel inclined to sleep, and having shaded my lamp, I seated myself at my window beneath the light of the calm cold stars that glittered in the firmament. Suddenly near midnight some- thing rustled in the hall; I heard a suppressed cough; then a door below-opened and closed softly, and presently I observed a figure move up and down the one avenue between flower- beds In the garden, which, like most of those in a city, could boast of little space. Regularly . up and down paced the scarf-enveloped figure, who, I became certain after a little, was Mil- dred.

"Do not urge me to' return to my room ; I cannot' sleep; I have not slept a whole night-through for weeks." I did not pause to reason with or persuade her, but descending the steps, I took her hand   3io    30  'TO MAKE IDOLS. with a determination that allowed :no resist. ance, and led her to her apartment, where I sat with her the hours through, talking some- times, and sometimes silent, until the morning sun shone brightly over the city, and life and sound awoke in its streets.- ', ',                    ^ *   CHAPTER XX.

She was very pale, but! it was not her pallor that distressed me. A   something I could not readily define aroused fear and awoke scrutiny.   I went back. in thought for a space and collected facts. Her manner for some time past had been very quiet, she had not gone out as much as usual, and her dress for days had been a gray alpaca, which no entreaties of her mother, could induce her to change. To an appeal of mine in re- gard to it one .day, she said. : "Better it were sackcloth, Bessie I " And I could not endure the look in her sad, large eyes, as I  turned away. To-night's motionless posture upon the sofa was a very common one of late, and one frequently re- tained for hours without speech or movement. Soon I said to myself: "This silent pride and melancholy of Mildred's are deepening into insanity. The ache at the heart is deranging the brain. I know it-I feelit--but what- can be done?"     .   316   HONOR  ' CANA AN. Presently, Mildred rose and passed from the apartment. I followed, and putting my arm about her waist, ascended the stairs with her until, reaching her chamber door, she paused. "Leave me, Bessie,' she said; "I would be alone for a little." And I left her, chilled and discouraged. It was a dark, wild night. I descended to the drawing-room, intending to remain until the hour for retiring, for- the house-maid had , just kindled the fire i' my room, and I could not endure the sound of the wind which rushed with a long low wailing round the house and shrieked at my window with such a scream of human woe and wild pain as made the blood curdle in my veins. Mr. and Mrs. Forrester sat at one side of a table, drawn near the fire, and I at the other worked diligently to com-  plete a collar I intended for Kate. The chil- dren romped and played about the room until Kitty came and took them to bed. The aspect of Mr. Forrester's brow was unusually gloomy, ,and the few questions which Mrs. Forrester ventured to address to him were replied to Iin monosyllables. The ticking of the clock upon ,;  6         w  ^i   HONOR O'CANAA.4  . 31   7 the mantel-piece, and the occasional rustling of Mr. Forrester's paper, were the only sounds that broke the quiet within, so strongly con- trasteed with the riot of the elements without. As the night deepened, the blast grew furious; it shrieked loud and long, rattled at the case- ments, swept through the trees, driving the naked branches against the panes, blowing so fierce a gale as doubtless wrecked unfortunate ships that night at sea. Suddenly Mildred Forrester stood on the threshold. We had not heard the door open, but a slight rustling roused attention, and di- rected our gaze to the entrance. Her attitude was that of a person listening in fear and distress. White and rigidly closed lips, a burning spot on either cheek, and a wild look Sin her dark eyes, gave her a  most strange appearance. Her mother rose with a  sudden exclamation, but was stayed by a gesture of her hand. She turned to her father, who sat expectant, but not- calm., , Listen!" she said. '.( Do you hear those -  voices, mingling sobs, and shrieks, and curses, in the wild night wind, upon this house, which A'           '   318 *   HONOR O'CANA VAXN. the pittance of the widow and the orphan, the scanty savings of the poor laborer, and the painfully acquired -hundreds of now ruined men help to sustain.

There are tears that freeze as they fall, there are groans wrung from' strong hearts'; there is wretchedness without, while you sit in splendor within. Come! you are wanted, and must go."  At'this moment the door-bell rang violently.  Mildred turned with a short, quick movement. "It is Dana Poinsett who rings," she ex- claimed. ' Tell him that Walworth i's not at home, but that I will see him, for I have that to say to him which he mutst hear." She made a vain- effort to advance a step or two, and fell with her face to the floor. Her mother rang for assistance, and she was carried to her chamber. To our surprise we found no fire there, neither had there been one kindled that day. On questioning Lolotte, she said j ...   H ONOR O' CANAAN. V that Miss Mildred had told her " there was-no need to make a fire, for many poor creatures were without fuel at this bitter season, and she felt quite warm enough." The physician, who had been immediately summoned by Mr. Forrester, pronounced Mildred's case a dangerous one.  "The fever," he said, " from her having long strug- gled with it, might prove fatal; the greatest care was necessary to abate the violence of the circulation, and give Nature an oppor- tunity of exerting all her force in overcoming the disease." Mrs. Forrester remained to watch beside her daughter, and after having vainly entreated her to allow me to stay with her, I retired to my room about midnight. But when I sought my couch, I was feverish and restless, tor- mented by a thousand fancies, bewildering and unreal. The next morning' Mildred was worse, and Mrs. Grey was sent for. I watched beside her for a short time, while her mother sought some rest in an adjoining apartment. -She lay tossing restlessly upon her bed,: now and    320 .

She motioned the cup away. - v ' 'Will you not drink, dear Mildred?" I asked. "Drink. mandragore, Dana Poinsett said. Give me mandragore to drink;"' and she looked beseechingly up Eat me; repeating her sorrowful petition again and yet again. For eight days the fever did not abate. Delirious most of the time, Mildred rave'd of banks and cashiers and Dana Poinsett in a breath, and the next moment she would- repeat long passages from some favorite German poet. The foreign language break- ing the silence of her sick chamber, affected me strangely, as I listened and looked at the worn face of the sick girl, as it lay upon the pillow, with the, long, golden curls swept away under the donfining cap. Mr. and Mrs. Forrester were distracted with fear and anxiety, and the whole household were in confusion and alarm, for Mildred was greatly beloved. At, the end of the eighth day she slept. Her physician L ' i\ i         ;...   HONOR  O') CANA VAN 321 and Mrs. Grey watched beside her. At her waking it would be known if she were to live or die. If she slept long and well, the phy- sician could venture to hope much.  The greatest silence prevailed in the house; a hush was even-in the street outside, for straw had been laid down, and just as the noise of approaching vehicles became almost painfully near, it ceased. Who may tell the suspense of the silent watches in this mansion? It ended in joy. Mildred awoke after a long and quiet slumber, calm, sane, and, her physician assured us, better, but weak as the feeblest infant. One day after Mildred became a convales- cent, I sought the answer to a question that had been in my mind often during the period of  her illness.- Where was Walworth?? Through all the time of her danger, we had neither seen nor heard from- him. My in- quiry was answered when I received a note from Mr. Poinsett, written the third day after :he load of fear regarding Mildred had been 'emoved  from  our hearts. He begged to now definitively how Mildred was, and stated "   .   .  -- , .

I answered his note and de-  i spatched it to him by Lolotte, for he waited  below, and on her return she informed me that the bouquet of rare and delicate hot-  house flowers, placed every morning for a week past on Mildred's table, had been brought by Mr. Poinsett himself, whom she described as. anxious and distressed beyond measure by the tidings of Mildred's illness. When Mildred was able to be carried from her room,-to the carriage, she was taken out, on pleasant days, for a slow drive; and as soon as she was pronounced able to endure the fatigue, she was removed to the farm to be under Mrs. Grey's care, until .her convales- cence should be complete. Here Walworth  visited her, and they either walked 'or rode together in fine weather until her health was restored. By his contrivance a sort of litter was made, in which, with the help of Philip ; Arran and Donald Ray, she could be carried  about the lanes and wood-paths in the vicinity, and more than once Colonel Aicheson was, ,*'      w II ' W  1 '           *  -      -   HONOR O' CANAAN.

It was nearly a week after Mildred's depart- ure before I was able to drive out to see her, for Lillian was ill with a slight cold and fever, and fretted so continually during my absence that I was obliged to remain her constant at- tendanit. When I reached Mrs. Grey's, I found Philip engaged with his protectress in making'out a list of scholars for. a school, which Mr. Irving had informed her was much needed in the village, and which she had under- taken to establish (with her father's consent), contributing one-half the means for its support, since the poverty of most of the people in the vicinity prevented their paying even a moderate salary to a teacher. I shook my head as I looked at Mildred's thin face and flushed cheek. "(Nurse Matty," I said, " do you allow this?" "Ah, no indeed, Miss Bessie!" she replied, "I   have just been expostulating vainly enough," and she looked distressed and anxious.   324  UHONOR O'CANA AN., Mildred flung her arms round Mrs. Grey's neck. -  "Take away paper and pencil, Philip," she  said, "and then pessie shall go over to Mr. Irving's with us, and learn all about the school's beginning from him." Mildred did not return to the city again. As she grew strong and well, the school (which flourished under her auspices) engaged much .   of her time; for although she had been fortu- nate in obtaining a competent teacher, she found that the school-children did better when ' encouraged by her presence and occasional ; instruction. She had found employment once more, and was happier for it.,   CHAPTER XXI. "AWRENCE ESTERLYN'S EXPLANATION..

In the quiet old garden, the    last evening of their life at school, Ellice Manvers stood with Kate, and talked of the future.

Sympathy on Kate's part, gratitude on Ellice's, had drawn them together, and the bond thus formed was not lightly to be broken. They dwelt once more, on their plans for the coming time, although they had been for months familiar to them, and renewed assurances of undying friendship.. They were to be constant correspondents, and when stim- - mer came, Kate was to spend the vacation with Ellice, who was to live with a maternal relative whose residence, in Carysford Place was near that of Mr. Forrester. With entwining arms about each other, they stood there in that old garden, chill though the air was (for it was February), until I called to Kate from the piazza, where I waited for her. Their parting was affectionate and tender enough for lovers. School-girls part often- thus; but years will  come and go, other friends will drop away ! from each, and they will be unforgetting, unes- i tranged still.

It was without superscription, and receiving it me- chanically, I asked;," What am I to do with this, Miss Manvers?" "Bear it carefully home, and give it atten- tive perusal; it is yours,' she repliea, with Ia gay smile. At this moment Kate called to me from be- low. Ellice detained me. "I have had this package for some time," she said, ' and have been strongly tempted to send it you before the time I .had promised to keep it in my possession was expired. You will understand me, when you examine the contents." I looked my surprise. Again she put her arms about me, and kissed me two Or three   A!  I ^           .    T $28  LAWRENCE'S EXPLANA TION.

He had called with a note from Mildred, who begged Kate to come to the farm for a few days. As we approached, the Colonel looked mischievously at Ellice, and after the conventional words of greeting had been spoken, he addressed her. I I received a little reprimand from Madame last week, Miss Manvers," he said, "She accused fne of an infringement of her rules, in obtaining an introduction to one of her- pupils without her knowledge. She did not spare -me, I assure you." Ellice's cheeks were scarlet as she replied: "I cannot regret that you have been made to suffer. Madame allows no introductions to gentlemen, under her roof, without her knowl- edge. I think you were aware of this." "I cannot plead ignorance," he replied. , But am I not infringing another rule in speaking to you now?" 'i   "AWRi/'rENCE',S EXPLANA TIO. A 3. "' Oh no!" she returned. "I am released from all surveillance.  This is my last day at school". "Do you leave this evening, Miss Man- vers?" I asked. "Yes,": she answered; "Madame is to send one of the servants to my aunt's with me." "Then will you not accompany me?"I     ; said. "The carriage waits, and your aunt's is but a few doors from Mr. Forrester's." "Why not dismiss the carriage and walk home," suggested Kate "The night is very fine." The Colonel immediately offered his escort, which was accepted, and, Miss Manvers hav- ing again spoken a few words of farewell to Kate, we left the house togecther. On our way, which led through several quiet squares, the Colonel entered into a lively conversation with ElAlice, who excelled in a kind of playful and witty repartee. I judged him well pleased with her, and was not surprised to hear him say that he would do himself the pleasure of calling upon her, in reply to her conventional   330  Z LAWRENCE'S EXPLANA,4 TION.  words of farewell as she ascended the steps of her aunt's residence.  When I was safely enclosed withih the   . walls of my, own room, I unfolded the small package given me by Ellice Manvers, about  which I had become not a little curious, from the fact of her having given it to me, accom- panied by so peculiar a manner, and such strange words of bestowal.- Upon removing the blank paper, of which the outside wrap- per consisted, I discovered underneath a su- perscription in Lawrence Esterlyn's hand- writing. The package fell from my grasp. My pulses throbbed, and I felt my cheeks glow. Soon I was weeping as I had wept during the days when I first knew  Law- rence was to wed Ellice. "He writes to bid me farewell and return my letters," I said to myself. The sickening conviction that I was about to read, for the last time, friendly words (I felt sure they would- be friendly) addressed to me from Lawrence, was mine. I took it to- heart in a burst of passionate weeping, which did not abate in its violent and bitter flow until midnight. Then I reproached myself for   =   LAWRENCE'S EXPLANATlON.  3.31 my want of self-con-rol, and gave him up at once and for all time. In burning words of prayer my heart went out to God, and so I ,grew resigned. This was Lawrence Esterlyn's letter to me: '"The trouble that I hoped might be averted came, Bessie. You have struggled and been in agony, and at length were laid upon a sick bed, from which you rose, I know how pale and weak, but calm and rich in hope that in its heavenward tendency has lost much of earthly longing.

"The promise to a dying mother that sep- arated us, Bessie, needs some explanation as to the cause of which it was the effect. Let me give it. "You know my mother to have been a stern woman, but high-principled, deeply pious, and strong almost passing belief in her attachments. In her early youth, a friendship which had existed between herself and a companion at   \\      ' 3 3 2 LA WRENCE'S EXPLANATION. school ripened ,into the closest intimacy, and Edith Sutherland and EMice Withers were like sisters through all the days of their lives on earth. Perhaps the fact of their being moth- erless and only children drew them more closely together; but whatever might , be the primary cause of their attachment, the noble qualities of each formed a solid basis for a lasting affection, which was known to, and com- mented on, by all their kindred. ,' Among the many male: acquaintances of my mother's at this time, was one of whom I find frequent me-tion made in her journal. For a space the conversation and attainments of Ellwood Manvers seemed to give my mother pleasure. She evidently enjoyed his society, although there existed on her part no tender regard for him. She took an intellectual de- light in conversing with him, nothing more. At length there came a disagreement. I find the following paragraphs in her journal: ' ' (I am sorry to have estranged Ellwood Manvers-sorry and glad. Sorry, because I admired him and looked forward to his being famous, witha sister's wish for his advance- st :f    I     "A WREENCE 'S EXPLAA TION.   333 ment, and because I truly hoped that after many trials I was now really to form a friendly attachment with one of the other sex which should be lasting. I took pride and delight ind him, and enjoyed exceedingly his conversa- tion on almost every topic, for he is possessed of an unique and fascinating and, subtle mind. And I am glad of the estrangement, because I fear that God is no God to him, Christ no Re- deemer, the Spirit no Comforter, and, with a Kempis, I believer that 'without Christ no :friendship can be strong or will be lasting; neither is any affection, of which Christ is not the head, true and pure.' I cannot but judge his intellectual pride to be such, that like Mil- ton's Lucifer, he would i' ' Rather reign in hell, than serve in Heaven.'

H fear he will go through life thus. He will make and keep no true friend, who, al- though lacking brilliant gifts, and perhaps in- . tellectual eminence, might yet prove of service to him in hours of human need and human affliction. He has judged me sternly, with no affection pleading at his heart, and yet he said I was dear to him, and called me pet names-- sister and friend. My woman's weakness and vanity, my nonsense and thoughtless jesting, have been severely criticised. I am found wanting. Yet an angel would scarce meet his requirements. Do I rebel against the fate which is Ito be that of all who shall call him friend? No; I merely give him up.   IAdo not criticise or scorn him.

' "My mother had been absent from home a season, visiting a dear friend in a distant city. During that time she had received but one or two letters from Edith Sutherland, greatly to her surprise and even distress. On her return, she learned that her friend had married Ell- wood Manvers, and sailed with him for Europe. A mutual friend placed in my mother's hand a farewell letter from Edith, in which she begged her friend's forgiveness for concealing her en- gagement from her, but saying that she did so at Mr. Manvers' desire, and explained that as *    336  LAWRENCE'S EXPLANATION. his affairs called him abroad, Ellwood had urged her to a union without delay, to which she had consented reluctantly, and with many a sad thought of the surprise and grief her sudden departure would cause her dear friend. "Ten years from that time, Mrs. Manvers, \ accompanied by her two children, Ellice and Edith, came home, a broken-hearted woman, to die. She had left her husband in Europe; ! 9. but she told no tale of wrong or cruelty, spoke e- of no failing love or final desertion. To the world he seemed a good, as he was esteemed a great, man; and it is probable, had she not-' earnestly pleaded to revisit her childhood's home, they would have lived together until -her death. All she said to her friend was: ' Ellice, we were unsuited to each other. Mar riage did not unite us.. Death will kindly sever a tie that bound uncongenial 'natures. Perhaps I needed the discipline of such'a mar-   riage. God only knows.'  - "Dying, Mrs. Manvers. left her children to my mother's care, in case. of whose death they were' to be placed under the guardianship of an aunt of her own, who, after my mother's de- i                 .   "A WRENCE'S EXPLANATION.   337- cease, gave both Ellice and Edith-to the charge of Madame- Merillat. The tidings of their father's sudden death had been received three months previous to my mother's last illness. I was ignorant of much of this history, knowing only that my mother had in charge two orphan girls, whom she had placed at a distant board- ing-school, and whom I had never seen, for I was a student in the classical school in M  ,at the time of their arrival at my mother's home. ( The sad fate of her friend had a singular effect upon my mother's mind. She dwelt often upon the unhappiness that followed any disparity in marriages, and- frequently, in my visits to her, questioned me closely in regard to your tastes and habits, your ambitions and religious views. When, troubled by your es- trangement, BEessie, I was summoned to her sick-bed, she saw with a mother's intuition that some sorrow I found difficulty in subdu- ing weighed heavily upon me, and erelong she learned all. A  week following this she died. It was her wish, her last command, that for one year I should not seek you, neither hold communion  with you, and that your let-             , .   338  LA WRENCE'S 'EXPLANATION. ters (did you write me) were to be: returned unopened. She herself superscribed your note to me, which she compelled me to return un- read, Bessie. When urging me to yield her obedience in this, she spoke of the fate of her friend, Mrs. Manvers. By her- unhappy mar- riage, by her tempted years of pain, by her early and sorrowful death, she conjured me to make the promise-. She liked you, Bessie, both for your own and my father's sake, who wished our marriage, and she left you some tokens of her regard, to be bestowed on your wedding-day, whether your marriage was with me or another. But when she comprehended that you had misunderstood and misjudged} me concerning the published pamphlets, although I pleaded that you had ample grounds for so doing, -so great was her dread of my forming an unsuitable connection, that she extorted the promise, from me and bounds me by a-vow. 'There can be,' she said, 'no unhappiness in married life like in- compatibility of mind! or aim. Both Bessie and yourself, Lawrence, will be made better, purified 'and strengthened by this probation, ^:2*  r ig      is  pro'.   * -----7 ri 9 Az WRENCES, EXPLANATION.   33 if you truly love one another. Disciplined, you will both be tested as to the reality and strength of your attachment.' "The days that followed my mother's burial I do not like to go back to, Bessie. They were full of darkness and sorrow, and of misgiving that my promise had been a rash one, that I  had no right to cause you unhappiness, for I felt that you were made wretched by my seem- ing neglect. Ellice Manvers, summoned -from a distant city, had been present at my mother's death-bed, and was aware of the compact I was obliged from a sense of duty to make. After a time, when I discovered that an inti- macy existed between Ellice and Kate, I made her my confidante, and she has been like a sister to me. To her I owe a constant transmission. of tidings of you, which has made my life en- durable. "For a time after your removal to Glen- Beck, so irresistible was my desire to see yoI, Bessie, and convince myself of your well-being, that I was in the habit of haunting the place constantly, often at night wandering about the grounds like a ghost. Frequently, when the   340-  LA WRENCE'S EXPLANATION. dusk was over all things,;I have climbed the low garden-fence, and, ascending the steps of the piazza upon which the drawing-room win- dows opened, have looked in through the partly closed curtains, and beheld you, Bessie,  with the children or with Miss Forrester, or sometimes reading aloud to Walworth Forres- ter, who sat beside you. There were mo- ments of sharp pain passed at those windows. Their memory is not pleasant to me. "One night I looked in upon a lighted but- deserted room. I lingered, hoping that you would make your appearance. My hope's ful- filment was not denied me. After a time you- came. I saw you seat yourself at the piano, and heard you play, and witnessed your suc- ceeding agitation. I felt that ini part at least I was the cause of your tears. I wonder now that I did not yield to the wild impulse that urged me to throw myself at your feet. I stood for a few moments struggling with myself; -then fearing to linger near you, I darted down the steps and across the garden with the speed of a madman.

I feared to trust myself there once more. "I have seen you but once since-then, Bessie. God knows the thankfulness of my heart when I held you safe in my arms, rescued ' froim a frightful death. "This explanation, which I am writing you, Bessie, on the, eve of my departure for Europe, I intend placing in Ellice Manvers' hands, to be given you on the day that concludes my year of promised silence. In case then of my de- tention, or perchance death, in Europe, 'you will learn through me the cause that has kept me absent and silent. It is my intention' to leave Europe for home in the month of March. '"And now, Bessie, it remains but to say what you must already know, that the happi- ness of my life is in your keeping.

"Even so," r said, as, rising from the perusal of Larry's letter, in which I had been interrupted many times by the violence of joyful emotion, I saw the pink clouds where the steps of the Dawn had passed on her way to herald the sun. 'Holding fast the precious letter and the min- iature of Lawrence which had accompanied it, I laid my head on my pillow, to seek a hap- pier rest than had been mine for months.

"Though the mills of God 'grind slowly, yet they grind ex. ceeding small; Though .He stands and waits with patience, with exactness grinds He all."  , ESSIE, come uphither!" And hearing the voice, I looked, and behold! Lawrence Esterlyn stood on a far height, which rose on the distant shore of a great water, spreading between him and. me. "I will come!"I cried, and embarking in a boat that was moored close to the water's edge, floated swiftly on and on to Lawrence. Overhead, the blue smiled in the light of the summer's sun; underneath, the waves sparkled   344    UPON THEMSEL VES. with transparent splendor; around me, the creatures of the deep' sported in innocent glee. Soft zephyrs' filled, the white sails of my tiny bark, and on the shore left --behind and that to which I was approaching, pleasant landscapes spread, verdant and fair. But my eyes beheld nothing but Lawrence standing in the distance, with a blessed smile of welcome in his face. Stretching my arms toward him, I called to him in the excitement of a wild joy. Soon I had landed and was climbing the eminence on which he stood, and from which he descended to meet me-- "Bessie! Bessie! Wake up! Do wake, Bessie!" I opened my eyes at the call, and they rested on the figure of, Kate, who in bonnet and shawl stood at my bedside. I closed them : again half involuntarily, and would fain have dreamed on. "Bessie! Sluggard and dreamer*, what vision did you have but now of Lawrence Esterlyn, that you murmured his name in your sleep?"  . Broad awake now, I started up. The letter A        I   UPON THEMSEL VES.     34 and miniature fallen from my relaxed grasp lay on the pillow. Kate seized the latter, and turned a questioning gaze on my face. "May I?" she said. "May you what?"I asked. "Open it?" she returned.  "Say yes, quickly, sister." "Some explanation is necessary before you see this miniature," I answered, laying my hand upon it. "Will you forego it, and grat- ify curiosity?" She did not answer, but opened the case. ," Larry!",she exclaimed in astonishment. I handed her the letter, which she took in silence, and began its perusal.. Soon she came quietly to- me, and said with a caress, "'Bessie, how stupid I have been! Can you 'forgive me? All this time you have loved and suffered, and I have never suspected what strangers have been aware of. I can under- stand now Ellice Manvers' questions regarding you.

"Oh, she asked if you were well; this-was 15'   346    UPON THEMSEL YES. a matter of course ; and if you liked teaching, and if your pupils were troublesome? She asked these things many times." "- I must write to Ellice," I said, with a pang at heart, remembering how jealous and unjust ' I had been. Kate sat apparently absorbed in thought. I went quietly about the room, now that I was dressed,-putting it in order, and opening the windows to give entrance to the clear, bracing air of a fine day. Presently Kate said: "( Poor Walworth Forrester!" "What of him?"I inquired.      - ",What of him?" she repeated half indig- nantly. "Bessie, are you aware of what your marriage-day-will be to him?"  "A trial, I know," I said; " but it will pass, sister. The woman whom he could not and would not wed, even did she love him, he must resign to another. Henceforth himself must suffice for himself for a. space at least, and God is over all. He has learned this long before  now, Kate."   .  "And yet I say again," she said persist ently, "Poor Walworth Forrester!"

The world wore quite a different as- pect to me this day, and as I walked among its men and women, I blessed them unawares. Kate was charmed with my gayety, and said with a smile: "You are looking like your own old self aga:n, sister; I wish mamma could see you now.                 / "What would I not give to see her!" I exclaimed. "Oh Kate! whether in joy or in sorrow, how inexpressibly precious is a mother's love!" "You should write mamma at once," she said.. "I intend to write this very day," "Yes," I returned, "she shall be written to. How papa and the boys will rejoice that Lawrence is free from blame!" Leiaving Kate at Madame Merillat's, I re- turned home and addressed to my mother a letter of joyful explanation, claiming her con-; F....^^^^^           1,-   3348    UPON THEMSELVES. 348    azor sves4 gratulation and sympathy, and then dispatched a note to Ellice Manvers, which brought her to my side at once. We talked, the afternoon through,' of Lawrence, arid I learned many things that must have increased my- love for him, had this been at all possible. Speaking, of his' promise to Mrs. Esterlyn, she said: "It was only when he saw that his mother was distressed beyond measure by his unwilling- ness to bind himself, that Lawrence yielded the. promise. Mrs. Esterlyn was a stern woman, Bessie.." "I know it," I replied, but said no. more. i I did not like to think, of her. The untold sufferings she had- caused both Lawrence and myself seemed to6 me unjustifiable by any motive, however good., and I feared to speak, of her, lest I should be led into some strong expression that would cause me deep ,regret. For the 'dead should be blameless. ' Passed from our midst, they can neither excuse nor amend what others may have found'reprehen- sible in their conduct in life. After dinner, I repaired to my room, to read Lawrence Esterlyn's letters to Ellice, which . .-         "C     , i    ."-   UPON THEMSEL VES.     34 349 she had brought for my perusal. I had not been long thus engaged, when a loud ringing at the door-bell, succeeded by a bustle- in the entrance-hall, and by a sound of running feet, startled and alarmed me, and instantly after, shriek after shriek rang through the house. Hurrying to the stair-head, I saw, in the lighted hall below, Mr. Forrester, stretched appar- ently lifeless on a sort of litter, his head sup- ported by Poulett, and Mrs. Forrester beside him, weeping, and wringing her hands. Four strange men who had carried Mr. Forrester home stood in the passage. Hastily descend- ing the stairs, I approached Mr. Forrester and untied his neck-cloth, for his face was purple, and then ordered him to be borne into the library, the door of which was near. Leaving Poulett to watch beside him, and apply such restoratives as were at hand, I sent one of the strange men for the family physician, and another for Walworth. The other two men I desired to remain until the physician's and Walworth's arrival. After doing this, I stood for a moment irresolute, for Mrs. Forrester had been carried helpless:    p50 -   UPON THEMSELVES. to her chamber, and the responsibility newly devolved upon me bewildered me not a little. Should I send for so6he of the neighbors, or await Walworth's coming? It was difficult to know what was right to do under the cir- cumstances, for I was aware of Walw6rt-h's disapproval of having the house filled with strangers in a time of affliction. I had notyet decided upon anything, when Honor O'Can- avan, who had been in the kitchen when the alarm  spread through, the- household, ap- proached me. p " Miss Bessie,' she said, "'dade and I'm feared for the masther. Have ye sint for Miss Mildred ?" " No, Honor,' I said, " she must be sent for." "Shall I bid Pierre go at wanst ?' she asked. As I assented, Walworth and the physician arrived. Mr. Forrester was pronounced to be suffering from a dangerous apoplectic attack, and the doctor proceeded at once to bleed him, ordering the application of blisters to his shoul- ders and limbs. Walworth in the meantime had questioned the men, who still waited in the   /. a.' UPON THEMSEL VES.       3 5 passage, and 'ascertained that his father had gone to an editor's office on some business connected with the bank, and there learned some disastrous news concerning a railroad company with which he was connected; which? news it 1is probable was the cause of his sud- den illness, since his agitation had produced an increase of the circulation towards the' brain. Mildred arrived in the course of the evening i with Mrs. Grey, and all the night through the anxious household counted the dreary watches in grief and dread. Mrs. Forrester was' half  ' frantic with alarm and sorrow. She had loved her husband, whatever his faults might have been, with - all the strength of her nature, and now to behold him in danger, and know him to be insensible to her love and care-it seemed an affliction too terrible to be borne. The next morning the soul of this man was passing without word or sign. His wife and children besought him with, words of tender entreaty, and the prayer for one dying was offered at his bedside, but he lay without sense or motion, and ere noon Mr. Forrester had gone to his own place. '.I .. ...   ..   352    UPOoNr THEMSEL VE S. In the splendid drawing-room, surrounded by all that he had taken pride in through life, the valuable and rare. things of this world which he could not carry out of it, lay Mr. Forrester in state. The marble statues in the silence looked upon him, who was now as cold as they, and the vast mirrors gave back a. picture of his dead face, until they ' shrouded both the marbles and the glass with a covering. The chairs he had occupied, the books he had handled, the pictures he had commented on, were all there, but the spirit which had moved: --that body, prone now and still, and had willed it so often to arise and walk, or sit down in the midst of all this splendor, where was it? "Man may not decide," I thought, for I had passed through the quiet hall and entered the drawing-room, where I felt the presence of the ,King of Terrors in the hush and chill which surrounded me, even before I had looked at the corpse, and experienced an awful calm at the sight of its cold repose. - There was no smile upon the face of the dead ; a hard, -stern  expression rested on the rigid features, and the mouth slightly open, and the eye staring and ,      " , r  bL. A   UPON THEMSEL;VE   .  353  l blank, gave a fearful look to the countenance. "We must put weights upon the eyes to keep them closed," said the undertaker, as I turned shuddering away. "Oh, yes," I exclaimed, "close them by all means; it is frightful to look on a face like that." In two days the house was filled with friends and acquaintances who came to the funeral. Helpless, Mr. Forrester lay to be gazed at by men, many of whom he would not quietly have borne la look from in life, but who now peered curiously into the coffin, without even a semblance of sadness on faces whose stony ex- pression matched that of the dead. Customr- required the absence of the family during the funeral service, and they had taken final leave of the dead before the hour appointed for the: arrival of the hearse. The burial service was read by him who had been Mr. Forrester's pastor, and in a short address the Christian l walk and conversationz, the noble deeds, and the charitable and kindly character of the de- ceased were commented on, in a way that seemed to me terribly satirical. Had Mr. Forrester been a poor man, but few words   354 A   UPON THEMSELVES. would haves been spoken over his remains. During-the service not a sigh was heard, not a tear was shed. All was hard, stern, and decor- pous usage; and when Mr. Forrester was car- ried forth to be laid in the " place appointed for all living, those persons who came to his funeral departed from the house with no gentle, or kindly, or grieving thoughts of him, and went about their daily avocations, not a whit less worldly, or callous, or grasping than before. , At the examination of his affairs, it was dis- covered that, millionnaire as he had been sup- posed to be, Mr. Forrester had died a ruined man. -The president of a railroad company,f it was learned too late, had been carrying on a ; system of deliberate-and ingenious villany-- appropriating the funds- of the company, and  offering spurious stock to buyers; at last ab-  sconding with;over two millions of this ill-  gained spoil. The company, of course, be- C one insolvent. Mr. Forrester possessed stock i-, the amount of several hundred thousand dollars, for he had entertained perfect confi- ,      ,        .       .  H--- ---   UPON THEMSELVES.      355 dence in the president. It is not to be won- dered at that the sudden shock"' of its ruin \  caused his death. Within a month 'of Mr. Forrester's decease, Walworth called a meeting of his father's cred- itors. Their bills, which had already been presented, comprised together a startling sum, for several large loans which had been- made Mr. Forrester were now' due.* Walworth,- however, assured all that they should be paid to the uttermost farthing. He only asked a little time, since it was necessary to make a sale of some real estate, and some personal property,'before their several claims'could be juStly attended to. With one consent, the creditors, who, perhaps, would have been more exacting with the father, promised the son six months' forbearance, which length of time, however, Walworth did not require.  In a short space, the splendid townhouse and Glen-Beck were sold, with all the valuable fur- niture, rare pictures, and costly statuary, and Walworth had the satisfaction of paying every  creditor the whole amount of his claim. :Beg- gared as they knew the family now to be,    356    UPON THEMSEL VES. these men, struck with admiration of Wal- worth's conduct, offered each to return part of the sum paid him, to be appropriated to the widow's use-; but this Walworth steadfastly refused, thanking them all warmly, how- ever, for this evidence of kind and'honora- ble feeling.' "He trusted,"-he said, "to be able by the exertion of his energies, in earnest and patient toil, if need were, to support the family now left to his care; his mother," he assured them, ( would feel better satisfied to render to every man his due." Walworth's hand was grasped with a hearty pressure by the creditors, who wished him success as they bade him farewell. In their homes he was spoken of with warm praise, and kind wishes were entertained for him by many wh6, during his father's life, had regarded him with indifference or scorn. .In his own person, Walworth was winning a name for honor and integrity, which, in the course of time, would do away with much of the odium that attached itself to him as the son of a disgraced banker. Glen-Beck, which had been purchased by Dana Poinsett, -was hired by Walworth for   -UPON THEMSEILVES.    357- the residence of his mother, Mildred, and the children. Mrs. Grey and her son left the farm, which Colonel Aicheson now owned, and came to live at Glen-Beck, where Robert Gre?'s presence was needed, since Walworth was ob- liged to be absent nearly the whole day at the University in M----. Mildred was to take my place as governess for the children, but she entreated me so earnestly to remain with her a i part of the summer at least, that I consented, though reluctantly, to do so, for Madame Mer- illat had already offered me a situation as teacher in her establishment. "Only think, Bessie," said Mildred one day, as she and I were together in my room, (' how often the furniture of this apartment has changed ownership. What once belonged to your father, and to mine in turn, is now another's.", "Yes," I said, " and I am reminded now, Mildred, that. you never. told me how its pur- chase by you came about." "Oh, it was all Walworth's doing," she returned. "When it was decided about . your coming to us, Bessie, he suggested my going to Ah ' ugete   358    UPON THEMSELVES. the auction sale with him, in order to discover if possible the furniture of your own room. We, found it just as you had left it, ready for the sale,; not a single article had been re- moved. I assure you I was quite delighted when it all came home, and I had the pleasure of superintending its, arrangement in the order I remembered to have been that of your apart- ment." At this moment Donald Ray, who had taken Poulett's place in the household, announced the presence of a gentleman in the drawing- room.     v "Did he give you no name, Donald?" asked Mildred. "He bade-me- gie ye a bit card, but I ha' lost it," said Donald, fumbling in the pocket of his coat. "Here it is," I said, picking up a card from the floor of the hall, just outside the threshold. It had Dana Poinsett's name engraved on it. 'As I gave it to Mildred I covered the letters a moment from sight. l "Be calm, Mildred," I said, as I removed' my fingers from the name. Reading it at   rUPON THEMSELVES.     359 once, she sankatrembling upon a chair, cover- ing -her face with her hands. "I  cannot see him," she  exclaimed; "Bessie, tell him I cannot;" and urging me again'and again; I at length reluctantly de- scended the stairs to meet Mr. Poinsett. The look of disappointment in his face was very apparent, as he beheld me: enter. After a polite but forced greeting, he asked, "Can I not see Mildred?" "(She sent me to you," I returned, "and Mrs. Forrester does not yet see any visitors." "Miss Wilmerton," he said with slight em- barrassment, "may I, beg you to return to Mildred and give her this?"As he spoke, he drew from his finger a small gold ring. "Long ago, when she was a mere child, Mil- dred promised to refuse me nothing, so long as I kept this ring, which was to be a pledge of good-will between us. I urge her to keep faith with me, and meet me now." Taking the ring, I repaired to Mildred. She, listened to the message I brought, but still refused to go. Then I dealt with her as I would with a refractory child.

Shecame to me ere sunset, Dana Poinsett's promised bride.   CHAPTER XXIII. "ONG LOOKED FOR, COME AT LAST. "My friend, my friend, where art thou? Day by day Glideth like some dark, mournful stream away."' ARABELLA STUART. i j ANA POINSETT'S resolve to marry 5l] Mildred had cost him a struggle. Beautiful as she was, and gifted be- yond most women, the obstacle that presented itself in the fact that she was the daughter of a man who had disgraced himself by conduct that could admit of no excuse or extenua-, tion, seemed for a time almost impossible to be overcome. But during her illness, when she was thought to be in the very grasp of the King of Terrors, he was taught how more than dear she was to him ; how utterly beyond life he prized what seemed about to' be snatched away; and then he made the resolu- 16    362 LONG LOOKIED FOR, COME AT LAST. tion to wed her if she lived, for he trusted with almost-an assured hope, that she, would not t say him nay. In talking over her engagement with Mil- dred, I said to her, "Colonel Aicheson's regard for you was very apparent, Mildred. I wondered greatly that you did- not like him better." "Alas, Bessie," she replied,    ' IA The moon looks on many brooks, The brook sees but one moon.' There were many, women fairer-and better There were many women fairer and better than I, whom Dana might choose ; but for me- there was, and is, but' one in all' the earth whom I may call husband-Dana, my chosen, first and last." She spoke with an eager, loving utterance. , -Worthy she was, and is," I thought, as. I looked at the renewed beauty  and softly, lighted eyes, " worthy the devotion of a life." "What do you say now, Mildred,. about love being the aim of a woman's life?"I asked, referring to a former conversation I had held with her. ,   .            "ONG LOOKED FOR, COME AT LAST. 363 "I maintain still," she replied, " that Christ, not love as we name it, should be the ' ultima tMztde of a woman's' existence.' Single women, to be happy, must devote their lives to God; ' but married women need to do so likewise, for a husband can never be a God. But a woman is made very happy to be truly beloved on earth. Together Dana and I will walkin love toward- that City ' where the Lord God omnip- otent reigneth,' and ' where the Lamb is the light thereof.' " Taught now, where I had been the teacher, I I looked at Mildred with: the liveliest sktisfac-  tion. Her affliction had been a blessing in dis- guise. With her heart not set on the things the world, not " of it"; prepared to do her Master's will, whether her bark was to ride 'through prosperous seas, or suffer from the fiercest and most destructive gales. The life of the inmates of Glen-Beck was I now peaceful beyond expression, I although an - unrest at times troubled my spirit, for -the '  winds often blew fiercely at night, and I thought of a beloved one who might even then be at i     364 LONG LOOKED FOR, COME AT LAST. the mercy of the tempest. Faith was often conquered by feat, as, risen amid the darkness and listening to the storm, I prayed for Larry's safe return, or for strength to find the All- Fadther's will mine- in whatever He might or- - dain. Yet hope- was strong, and with the morning light I was cheered again. Mrs. For- rester, who was greatly changed since her hus- i band's death, left her room and sat with us often of an afternoon now,-and Mr. Irving, visiting us frequently at this season, sought to inspire- her with a portion of his own devout and fervent spirit. And after a time, Mrs. Forrester, eschewing the world and the " things of it," learning the best Christian wisdom, shook off her depression, rose from her griev- ing silence, and went about the house, and among the destitute in the village, doing what her hands " found to do with her might," and gained in her work- an exceeding great re- 'ward.  Tommy, whom Walworth knew to be 'worldly and grasping, boy though he was, was placed by him with Mr. Irving, and in this good man's so- ciety he learned that it was not all of life to live    "ONG LOOKED FOR, COME AT LAST. 365 on earth; and there was a prospect that in time Tommy,^ through the teaching and exam- ple of his pious and excellent tutor, would be- come less worldly and selfish than he was ever known to be before. Gentle Frank and dear and beautiful Lillian remained at home. In the household where now God was worshipped in simple piety, and where daily lessons in uprightness were given, these children were likely to grow up " un- spotted from the world." Walworth and Mil- dred were trusty guardians for such as they. Philip Arran, now  no Io,nger little "lame  Philip," for he was become a tall and fine- looking youth, had been placed at a- classical school in the city of M , by Mr. Irving's advice.  From thence he was to go to the university with which Walworth was con- nected, and who could exercise over him that watchfulness Mildred  earnestly begged her - brother to maintain. The interest of the little ,fund which Mildred had placed in the bank in Philip's name sufficed to meet his school ex- penses; and out of school he spent most of" his leisure at Walworth's rooms in the uni- his I   a            e  uiI   366 LONG LOOKED FOR, COME AT LAST.' versity. After-a time Walworth found Philip's services very useful; he was able to assist in copying a scientific work upon- which'Wal- worth had been long engaged, and which he was preparing for publication. Mildred took the greatest pride and delight in Philip, who seemed so well to reward her kindness, and I saw that the lad, who came frequently to -Glen- Beck, had lost none of the feeling of almost adoration with which his- poet's soul regarded her. To him she was indeed an, angel of light.  #  . -    I.   , The winged w eks fled on. The frost- bound gates of winter were unbarred by the delicate-fingered spring, and the voice of streams and bird-music, and perfumed breath of blossoms, filled the air, and earth- wore her festal robe again. Glen-Beck bloomed in .al- most paradisal beauty, but Lawrence was not yet come, and albeit the days were short by reason of anticipation, and I took a keen pleas- ure in the blossoms and fragrance of the season, a care at heart I would scarcely confess to myself began to weigh daily upon me. There had *.w--H-- -------*-,-Y---UF m   "ONG l9OOKED FOR, COME AT LAST. 367 been tidings of one or two vessels on their re- ' turn voyage from Europe being in. danger of wreck, and one was- supposed to be lost in a furious gale that had swept the Atlantic for days. I was filled with a wild fear until, I .learned that Lawrence's name was not among those of the passengers in the ill- fated ship. What kept Larry absent and silent now? I questioned. Alas! the wings of my fair hope were fast becoming fettered by-doubt and fear. I paced the garden-walks of Glen-Beck one eventide, and marked the red, gold of sunset tinging the tops -of the trees, and heard in the distance the gentle murmur of the Monoskisy as it flowed over its pebbly bed, and beheld the clouds hang purple and red above the dis- tant mountains, lending a last glory to the dying day. "I must bid farewell to this pleasant spot erelong," I said to myself, as I looked about a little sadly, for the beauty of the place had- charmed me from the first, and it was but natural I -should experience a pang in leaving it. Mildred's marriage was to take place soon, and then, although she earnestly "H A R1,-"-'-----1           --    368 LONG LOOK(ED FOR, C04ME AT LAST. entreated me to remain at Glen-Bck, I was firm in my decision to leave for Madame Merillat's establishment,- where as teacher I was to receive just half the sum paid me by Mr. Forrester in my capacity as governess. Dim and drear the future looked, and as I ap- proached the house when night fell, I con- trasted the richly colored life which had been mine-but a few weeks before, with the almost barren uncertainty of my present lot. ; Slister Kate was standing with a gentleman upon the steps of the piazza as I "drew near. When I beheld her companion, I stopped transfixed. It was impossible to'mistake the lift of that noble head, the bearing of that fine figure. It was Larry, but I neither moved nor spoke. Presently he perceived me, and came rapidly down the steps and along the path to- wards me. Soon he held me in liis embrace, but I had: no words of welcome for him;' I could only put my arms about his neck, and burst into tears.        . / When I became composed-for I was soon calmed and solaced by Larry's words and presence-we talked, oh! how we talked of  J   - LONG LOOKED FOR, COME AT LAST. 369 the past, of-the future. Anticipation's stern sister, Reality, seldom gives what the former so abundantly promises in her name, but in these' moments of reunion with Lawrence, I tasted fruition. What had detained Lawrence? Through all the days that I had awaited his return, with a -sickening heart and a fainting hope, he watched beside a dying friend, who had accompanied him to Europe in the hope that the change and milder air of the Conti- nent would restore his failing health% Im- patient as Lawrence was to hasten his return, he could not leave his friend to die alone amid strangers, and he remained with him to the last, receiving his dying message to kindred at home, and finally seeing him laid in his lonely grave on a foreign shore. Then he came as speedily as wind and wave could bring him to mel Oh, how I reproached myself for my faithless and irepining spirit during late days. Unselfishy performing the "task that was nearest him," Lawrence' truly merited the Master's words, t"-well done." Latethat night, when enclosed within the 16*    '   370 LOXG LOOKED FOR., COJME dT LAST. walls of my own room, I stood before the glass and loosened the front bands of my hair, thinking that I would henceforth curl it in the old fashion again, now that Larry was come. Mildred entered to offer me her congratula- tions. Kate had, told her all. Then Mrs. Forresteir came, and finally Ellice Manvers and Kate; for sister and her beloved compan- ion were spending a few days at Glen-Beck. Kissed by all in turn, warm and earnest wishes were spoken for my future well-being. Hwas. very happy, but when the door closed upon my dear and kind friends, a sorrow mingled with my joy, as I listened through the silent watches to the measured tread of the occu- pant'of the chamber nearest mine. Walworth Forrester paced the floor the night through. * LI -I Ii- * 4          -,   CHAPTER -XXIV. THE WEDDING. Angel.-"Go, child! Fulfil thy fate! Be-do-bear--and thank God." " FestUs." '0 the sound of choral singing went Dana Poinsett and Mildred Forrester up the aisle of Moreton church, to be wedded. And -the minister questioned, and they made answer, to take each other " from that day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, 'till death did them part;" and the bridegroom looked up, and the bride drooped her lids, and both were praying; he after his man's fashion, and she  in womanly meekness; and the blessing of God rested upon the two. Who wept at this bridal? None save Philip Arran and the little chil- ^    372      TH^E  WEDDING.  dren to .whom Mildred had been an angel of comfort and blessing. Philip's tears were almost those -of jealous love, so madly had his boy's heart worshipped her; -but the burning flush on his cheek dried the drops ere they I fell. When he left the church, he carried with hIim as orrow he would not confess as such - to himself, yet which he would be years in' gaining a mastery over. Young poet and lover, he took early in life the suffering that was to add a sadder depth to his rhymed lays, thrilling the heart of the reader with a tender pain. The little children wept, because. they'feared their benefactress was not to return to them any more; and Mildred left her. husband's side, to speak a few comforting words, assur-  ing them she was still to live at Glen-Beck; -and as she left them consoled, she found 'the path from the church porch to the carriage strewn with flowers which these little ones had- brought in the gratitude of their loving, hearts. .Dana lifted a- few, of the blossoms and placed them in his bosom. "They shall be kept for the day on 'which   : THE WEDDING.     373 we celebrate our silver and golden marriage- feasts," he said, referring to an ancient Swedish custom, and he looked in the radiant face of his bride with a feeling of love and pride that did him' great credit in my eyes. It had been Lawrence's wish to be married on the same day' with Mildred, and he urged his point as strenuously as ever lover did, and Mildred urged it also, but I would not listen to either. It was my desire to hear from my parents first: "Let mother decide how and when I should be married," I urged; " letters . must soon. come from the West." But I waited long and grew many times impatient, and yet such came not; and at length Larry wrote, though .Kate teased him mercilessly for so doing. Silence followed'his application also, and I began -to grow uneasy lest some evil had happened to the dear ones far away. Dana and Mildred had been some days returned from a visit to Mr. Poinsett's kindred in the North," whither they had gone after their marriage, when one day, at dinner, Donald brought me a note, which when opened proved to be from brother' Charley.   374.    sTHE WEDDING "Hurrah! sister Bessie, here .we are in town again, in dear old M---.

Walworth and Mildred accompanied me to the city. The rapture of the meeting with my- parents and brothers cannot well be described. My mother drew me to her bosom with an. inexpressibly tender look, and I wept out' my excitement where as a child I had often sobbed myself to ,sleep, exhausted by the violence of some infant grief. "We are to be parted no more, my love," she whispered with a caress. The cup at my lips seemed filled to overflow- ing; I found that joy, like grief, could over- whelm, and was relieved when my father,   376     THE WEDDING. gathering us about him as of old, knelt in our midst and poured out the fulness of his heart  in thanksgiving to the Giver of all good.

I am to, be married within a month, when we are to start for Europe, and I would, nay, must, see you before I leave, for years of absence will separate us. It is Larrie's intention to reside on hiis- property' a grange in a pleasant county in England, which he tells me needs only a little improvement to make it a most desirable home.

To be in Paris with her friends is to reach, for her, the very summit of earthly felicity. And now, Marie, 'shall- I have to plead for your coming hither? Must I urge you by our past friendship not to deny me this pleasure? We have been long separated. You surely wish to see me. Come then at once.

Larry, who has read the concluding para- graph over my shoulder, remonstrates, but finding me firm, threatens to go for you him- self, if you prove unpersuadable. Marie, be reasonable.

Taking a hasty leave of the circle with whom ,my lot had been- so long and so unexpectedly cast, I journeyed to the North, and arrived in time to be present at my friend's wedding. Lawrence and Bessie were married, in a plain, Presbyterian fashion, by the aged minister who had  officiated when Bessie's parents took upon themselves vows at her baptism to train up their childt for God's ser- viceupon earth. Twowhite-robed and beauti- ful children stood beside the bride during the ceremony--Lillian Forrester and Edith Man- vers; and Lillian wept, though she did so quietly and with an effort to conceal her tears. Mrs. Forrester, and Mrs. Seytoun, and Mr. and Mrs. Poinsett, and Tommy and Frank, and Philip Arran, the poet boy, and Mrs. Grey, were all there. If to be surrounded by loving hearts could add to Bessie's happiness, this 'day she was richly blest. H er parents looked at her with a tender joy, and her brothers with an ill-concealed and boyish pride it amused me to mark. It was not until the wedding was over, and the- guests departed, that it g; I'. ,            I;lllC- ' 'C '4 *.inii*.iiiiiiiii  "1[  '  .

Kate put into my hands a note ,from him to Bessie, offering his congratulations, but declining, without excusing himself for so doing, the in- vitation to her wedding.. The note ended with a wish for her happiness, that was almost a prayer. "It is not likely that Mr. Forrester will ever marry," Kate said to me as I returned the note. "No," I answered; and as I turned away I thought, " the burdened prisoner he told Bes- sie of, who sang in his cell and comforted other prisoners, until the pale Messenger came to loose his bonds and give him freedom, is like him. For him earth has neither rest nor bliss. For such as he Heaven   only can afford fruition."  My friends had not been abroad a year when .I received a letter from Bessie informing me of Ellice Manvers' marriage with Colonel Aicheson, who had followed her to Europe. They were to spend some  years in travel on the Continent.          ' , o ,    * I '  ' ,    ' i     I   FINIS.       38I I cannot well describe ,the feeling with which, in after years, I regarded Walworth Forrester ; for I became acquainted with him  some time after my friend's departure, and knew him for an earnest worker and -a true thinker ; a man " set apart " for God's service; albeit he preached from no pulpit,-and ex- horted none in a ministerial capacity. He' kept on his course over the buried ruins of his earthly-hopes, as men sail above beloved dead, beneath the sea-Nyaves, knowing them to be there in the caverns and hollows of the great deep, but steering straight for the.,haven for which sails were spread and the ship given to -the breeze. To use the language of Sartor Resartus, Walworth "' was not in the everlasting no, he had reached the everlasting yea; he had re- ceived its sweet and solemn evangel---he did not tarry long in the valley of the shadow of death; he did not spend needless hours in the dungeon of the giant Despair;" he looked abroad upon a world filled with much good, but also with much evil. The good he did all in his power to encourage; the evil he set    382       FINIS.  himself bravely to resist. He was but one of a few armed for the conflict, but he would do what he could. And what he did the Record-  ing Angel wrote down in imperishable charac- ters, to be preserved against the Judgment 'Day.  In 'the poorest and filthiest suburb ;of the city of M  , in the midst of dilapidated "houses, filled with 'terribly depraved occu- pants-,drunken, blaspheming men, despairing women, and impish and precociously wicked children, -a small building was erected, plain in exterior, and within filled with benches' and desks, It was'a school-room, if you like-to call it so; but what pupils gathered about the - master and his assistant-Walworth Forrester' and Philip Arran!.: Toil-worn figures, and dark and haggard and sneering faces, every- where met the eye. They were those who were straying in the shadow. The master sought, to lead them into a marvellous light. Sabbath after Sabbath he labored among these benighted ones, seemingly to little purpose, for few openly-acknowledged themselves con- victed of sin, or professed a:desire to learn of     FINIS.       383 Christ. The neighborhood, it is true, had a better name, and the children were cared for  -     . -       - 1 by parents whose lives, perhaps, were not- much, amended, but whose hearts were touched by the words of the master, who, while his work to all appearance progressed so slowly, might well have despaired. But his will was strong-his faith great-his aim per; fect. "Christ sitteth at the right hand of the- Father; I will abide 'till He come," was his inward thought, and his quiet work went on. In the prison, in the hospital, on the" thronged wharves, Walworth was a frequent visitor, admonishing, consoling, warning of evil.; even the most rebellious gave the cour- teous stranger a-respectful' hearing.' And in the crowded room where weekly gathered German sceptics, Walworth was at home; here he argued with patient skill, in their own language, with misled but intelligent men. Such were some of the tasks with which his leisure time was filled, for he still occupied the professoros chair at the University'of M By the world he was judged a polished but ambitious student, devoted with an almost in- t dra 3117   T" - .  ; ..  . f .  * -  7. 384 sane passion to abstruse researches and the gaining of scientific lore; and his rare presence at their festive gatherings was welcomed with undisguised pleasure. -How true it is that we see. -our fellow-men as through a " glasg, :darkly," and seldom " face to face."' And now. it remains but to say' that -the Wilmerton family were -greatly honored in this  world. Men could not show them too great courtesy, or 'offer them. horiage in tfoo full a measure. The Forresters were m ade to feel  occasionally their father' disgrace through the whole of their lives, for the course of the ) dishonorable financier could not be soon for- gotten. But toboth families the opinions of men availed little, after a time. What praise or blame what prosperity or adversity, could 'move to much emotion those who lived " un- spotted from the world," knowing themselves to be called to the " marriage-supper of the Lamb"?
