i~~sted upon Maud Livingstone, while the rosy sunbeams
tlie~ daily delight of her guardian to impress her with the
idea that she was little better than a pauper, and that it
was only by his generosity that she was not a beggar in
the streets, no surprise will be expressed w~n it is re~
corded that life failed to impress her with t1i~se Protean
charms which usually fascinate the young.
A chic to the malignant persecutions which were
heaped upon this orphan girl may be discovered in the
fact, that he had deeply wronged her.
Aye, and to go further, it was because his conscience
unceasingly racked him with the thought that lie had
buried her father in a bankrupt's grave, while his coffers
were enriched with the gold won by treachery, and
which, by right, should now be hers.
Could the same last resting-place have held both parent
and child, he would have gloated on their double death
With the~ brutal pleasure of a ghoul. Failing, however,
to realize this wicked desire, and having the child evei'
before him as a daily torture, he made her young life
pay the penalty of his iniquity in loneliness and in teai~.
Mrs. Marlowe shared the prejudices of her husband ~n
all subjects, and only added fresh thorns to the crown
~which they daily placed upon the unoffending head of
tlieir helpless charge. She was a living representative of
~ cei~tain class, who are saint~ in public, and vipers in
pri ~ge life, and with much external, religion, her woman'~
~ ~~nwomanly heart entertained no spark of sympathy for

that they would be to her as father and mother? Were
they not afraid that he would come back from the grave
to blast them ~ven as they were bligh ting the life of hi8
fitagile child AMen who have no fear or respect of God
in their hearts dare do anything, arid living in fancied
security, dream nut of the wrath that is accumulating
ao'ainsf and ~itin~ for them until the final day. 4... ~
Under this galling experience, Maud's young heart
became embittered just when her pathway should have
been strewn with roses. Her nature was as sensitive
as a poet's, and some faint idea of the oppression under
which she daily writhed may be found in her constant
contemplation of suicide. But these thoughts would be
vanquished by the consciousness~ of the sin of indulging
them, and taking up her cross again, Maud would return
with heavy heart to bitter realities, determined to meet,
if powerless to resist, her cruel fate.
Among the mountains of Georgia, the beautiful village
of M~ nestled lovingly, arid with its varying scenery~
cool air, and good water, presented a delightful retreat ~
to those who were in search of health and repose. Among
its most honorable citizens Mr. Marlowe stood ~pre-emb :i~
nent, and when people passed his stately residence thayE
said, "How fortunate Maud tivingstone is, to have s~reh

Wi~fhin that house a trio sat ~t the~ tea-t'  -~

ing creatures, they might have been mistake~fo  ~

14         "WHO WAS HER FATHER?"

tons, for they exchanged no words, and the only sound
to be. heard was the sipping of tea, and the occasional
clatter of china. The room was severe, but tasteful, and
the same precision~ which was to be observed from~garrct
to basement in that prim house, here also predoiiiiii~ted.
The walls \vere frescoed in light oak, the furniture was
rich and elaborately carved, while carpet and curtains
,harmoniously blended ~in producing that effect upon the
eye, which found ready endorsement by cultiv~itcd taste.
The side-board and tea-table glittered with silver, but
little did the penniless girl who ~sat there imagine that it
was purchased by her father's ruin and death. Maud's
tea ~vas untasted, and she sat carelessly turning the pages
of the "Court of Napoleon." Mr. Marlowe had handed
her' the book when he entered, and on the title-page was
written, "A birthday gift for Maud, from G. S."
True, it was her seventeenth birthday, but she had for~
gotten it until that moment, and as memory took a hasty
review of the cheerless past she sighed, in thinking of its
loijeliness.
Scanning the book hastily, she turned again to the
* frontispiece, which represented Josephine in all the
gorgeousness of, imperial robes, and in all the radiance of
effulgent prosperity, fo~ the picture 'had evidently been
taken at the flood of fortune. But while looking upon
the smi1h~g face, Maud's thoughts recalled the noble
woman in her wretchedness, the deserted wife who was
sacrificed to gratify ambition; and she wondered if any
1. pi4ure was extant of the discrowned queen, who passed
tbe evening of her life in such desolation at the omin~
~ti~1y named' palace of .Afalmctison, the house of pain.
The chord of sympathy '~~~as touched, for a heart which

has had sorrow of its own is always more sincere in Leek
ing for the misfortunes of others, and to Maud's chagrin
a tear dropped upon the open page.
"Maud, your tea is getting cold; put by your book
until you have eaten something;" and Mrs. Marlowe's'
voice jarred discordantly on the silence.
"Thank you, I do not wish any tea," and her ~voice
was tremulous wi~h hushed tears.
"Well, what are you crying about? I do not see any.
*   thing to cry for."
"Always blubbering about something," added Mar.'
lowe, looking up. insteadd of being thankful for the
home I g~ve you, one would suppose you were shut up in
a dungeon, from the way you go moping and crying
around."
"Indeed, I'm very grateful, Mr. Marlowe," Maud
answered, between sobs and tears.
"Thankful, the d-l! What are you always crying.
for, then?"
"Be~ause-.-..--.2' But the sentence was nnfinishej for
the tears burst forth in such a torrent, as to prevent fur:
tlier conversation.
Even the heart of the waiter was touched, and ~he
brushed away a. tea~ that flowed in sympathy for the*
unfortunate girl, whose lot had been cast amoY~g such
unfeeling people, while the faces 'of husband and wife
Were expressive rather of triumph than of kindness.
After watching Maud for some little time, Marlowe
said-.-
"You'll find when you have to work for your daily
bread, that you'll not have time for so much
o perhaps you had better take it out here."

(


16

WHO WAS HER FATHER?"

No response but fresh SOI)5. Suddenly s rting up~
and gi~asping her book, Maftd was hastening from the
room, when Marlowe sprang to the door, and seizing her
by the arm, detained her saying,-
"not so fast, Miss Sentimentality; I have business
with you. As you know, you have been educated for a
teacher, and it was the dying request of your father that
~ou should not be a dependent, after you were old.
enough to support yourself. I think your education is
sufficiently far advanced for you to take charge of at
least a primary class, and I wished to ask if you desire
me to advertise for a situation for you?"
The last sentence had been spokeii in such a sneering
tone as to arouse Maud's xvhole being with indignation,
~nd standing there weeping, the desire of her heart was
to be a man, that she might strike her tormentor dead at
N\   her feet.
Marlowe still held her by the arm, and after awaiting ~
impatiently for a reply, said:
"Did you hear what I said?."
K        "Tf you please," was the indistinct reply, and fresh
P tears were added to the torrent which was falling, as she
then fully realized that the "wide, wide world" was soon
to be her home.
"Why do you not marry George Stanley?"
As if forced to answer, she said brokenly,-
"ITe-has-never-aske). me."
"From present appearances, he'll do that soon," Mar~
lowe said sneeringly, as he dashed her arm ~wayjrom
him; "and who knows, perhaps you may be a fin lady
some day, instead of a poor little music teacher!"
But Maud was gone, for human nature could stand nu

more, and in the sanctity of her chamber she wept hot
loneliness and misery, while her tormentor was wearying
his brala with some new extortion or villany.

EORGE STANLEY was very popular, and nW
unjustly, for it is rare to find a man combining;
so many admirable traits. To a widowe4 moth~
er and only sister, he was a model son and brother,
leaving nothing undone which could add to their happi~
ness. By his habits of morality and general good coii~
duct, he had won the respect of old and young, and it
had passed into a proverb, that "George Stanley had net
an e~einy in the tpwn." Add to his unblemished repu~
station a large fortune, and the combination which made
him so eagerly sought will be readily discovered. All
things taken into consideration, it is not surprising tht~t
several match-making inammas failed to hide their vexa~
tion, ahd that as many calculating papas groaned in~
hardly, when it became currently reported that he w~s a
suitor for the hand of the penniless Ataud Livfrgt~~
But women are not generally attracted hy such mo~


men, and not infrequently' are they discarded for the
dash and impudence of some reckless profligate. Domes~
tic unhappiness ensues, and when it is too late, the warn-
ings 'of anxious parents ring in tliQ ears of the wretched
,'and perhaps forsaken wives.
George had been Maud's earliest and best friend, and
it is not strange that this long-existing friendship should
~have ripened into a warmer feeling, as the years advanced.
.Their parents had been deeply attached to each other,
and this family were solitary in besto~~dng upon Maud
that love for which her bereaved heart yearned. It was
only beneath their roof that she ever approached gayety,
as it was there only that the pleasures of home were
revealed to her. Almost every day saw her the recipient
of some delicate gift from George, which was evidently
the suggestion of a deep and thoughtful love ;~ but in
accepting these tokens of his affectionate regard, she
failed to realize that she was encouraging a passion which
her heart could never reciprocate.
As yet, no word of love had passed between them, and
rumor was false in naming the solitaire diamond ring
worn by her a betrothal pledge. True, George had
placed it upon her finger, but there was nothing binding
in it; and she innocently wore it, without the thought
that it might excite inquiry or suspicion.
She had been spending the evening at the Stanleys',.
and George thought he had never seen her look so beaw
tiful, dressed as she was in' simple white, with a moss
rosebud in her rich brown hair. In truth, he was infat-
~iated, and, under the witching. influence' of the moonlight
that night, he felt as if forced to disclose the unutterable
Iove'which filled his heart.

His deep blue eyes were brimming with tenderness, a~
now and then he furtively gazed upon her, in the half
cowardliness with which love sometimes possesses his'
victim; and silently they wended their footsteps in the
moonlit direction of the Marlowes'.
The silence was ominous, Maud thought, for women
know by intuition when a certain interesting hour has
arrived, and the bantering words which4 she tried' to
speak died upon her lips. Both were ill at ease, and while
George only looked and sighed, IMlaud hummed snatches
of song to hide her embarrassment, and then-after
a wlmile-George said in a stammering, school-boyish
way:
"Do you know, Maud, that for years I have done little
else than think of and love you ?" and pressing her hand,
he gazed into her face f~or
lie was trembling 'with his reply.
the emotion which thrilled his
being, and it was a rude shock to him when Maud laughed
in his face, and said:
"Why, George, what a woi~tl~less life you have led!"
"No, not worthless, if I have won your love in return;"
his tone expressing all the earnestness he felt.
"You know I love you, George, for I think you are the
only friend I have in all the world."
"It is not as a frieimd that II wish you to love me, Maud,
but as your husband."
"But I cannot love you as my husband unless we were
married," ~he answered laughingly, determined If possi-
ble to evade 'the crisis.
"But i~wish you to be married to me, darling, and
could you look into my heart, and see how I wQrship you,
you wonld.mnake me the happiest of men, by naming out

wedding-day this very night;" and his manner was con
~deut of Sn CCCS5.
With the singular rapidity which is perhaps only
known to women, all the friendship that she' had for
merly entertained for George was instantly changed into
a kind of disgust, and she almost disliked him.
Explain it, ~ye who can! Maud only knew that th~J'
change was there, and although scorning herself for such )
ingratitude, she still could not control the sudden
unaccountable revulsion which had taken place in her
heart. They were now at the door, and the declaration
she had first listened to remained unanswered. She
deeply regretted this misplaced love, and her silence
arose from a desire to avoid giving pain..
"Why 'do you not speak to me, Maud?" he then said,
anxiously.
But still no answer came. 'Then pressing her hand to
his lips, he murmured, in a pleading tone:
"Don't you love me, j tist a little, Maud?"
Now, why could she not have looked him in the face,
and in a straightforward, honest way have said, "No;
Idon't!"
She was not a coquette, but her great desire to spare
her ~Iover's, feeling made her vacillating to a degree that
rendered her almost as culpable as a premeditated flirt.
For the first time this trait of~ her woman's nature pre-
dominated, and she answered his question by saying very
archly:
"Don't you know?"
"But tell me, Mand, do you love me?" His tone was,
Lull of apprehension.
"And what if I don't?" she said, playfully.

UNDER THE MOONLIGHT.            21
"how tantalizing you are;" but 'never suspecting front
her manner that his love was not returned, he folded hei~
to his heart and said:
"Come now, darling, let this ring you wear be our
gagement ring," and as ho attempted to seal the sacred
mpact with a kiss, she cried:
'Oh-no !-no !-no-George!" and, blushing half
with shame, she extricated herself from' bis embrace.
~, Then seeking refuge within the hall, and peepin~through
an opening in the door, she said:
"Good-night, George! Good-night."
But the heart of the young man was deeply wounded;
and without responding he walked sadly and slowly
away. His frank, cheery face wore an aggrieved expres-'
~ sion as the moonlight fell upon it, and his heart ached
~ with the keen disappointment for which he was so en~
i timely unprepared. It was a cruel 'awakening from a
dream, rosy with hope and sweetened by e4ectation.
Until that moment he never suspected but that the love
of his young lifetime had kindled something like mag-
netic sympathy in the heart of iMlaud Livingstone.
Engagement ring, indeed!" she said, when within
her chamber she jerked the unoffending diamond from
her linger. And as his love, so was his gift spurned-.
his sole offence, that he loved her!
ho can explain it? What is the cause of such per- ~f'
versity ~ Why is it that both men and women feel a sort
of sufficiency that amounts almost to contempt whenal
love is won~
It matters not how difficult or dangerous the chase has
been, it all seems forgotten, sometimes even within ~th4U

plin'ient can an honorable man bestoW

henceforth denied even her friendship?
She was his all in all-" the ocean to the river of his
thoughts," and to his latest moment he would love her.
Under the moonlight which streamed into her room,
Maud fell asleep thinking on all these inconsistencies,.
~ud when the gray dawn marched silently up in the East,
she still slumbered, dreaming of the mysteries and per-
plexities of this twofold life.

CHAPTER III.

TIE was neither a blonde nor a brunette, but a

strictly classic, and many an artist has sighed in vain for*~
such a model. It was quite evident that Colonel hart-
ridge was fast becoming a victim to her charms, and to
Mrs. Marlowe's chagrin, the breakfast did not tempt him,
for. his eyes did his feasting on the summer morning in
piestion.
The Colonel came from the beautiful seaboard cit~f
~asrannah, and combined with a line personal appearance

that courtliness of manner which is not unusual among
her citizens. He was a lawyer of some eminenceA~~ ar3d
having known Mr. Marlowe through business transae~ons,
had been induced to accept an oft-repeated invitation to
visit him. He was rather reticent than talkative, but
what he said was well-spoken, and to the point.
If Maud had ever thought of him at all, it was in a
grandfatherly way, and although he had been~ in the
house some weeks, they had exchanged but few wdrds.
her deportment was always refined and lady-like, but
over-sensitiveness produced a reserve which rendered hei
almost unapproachable. J~
Under these circumstances, Colonel Hartridge wor
shipped at a respectful distance, and said little to the ob-
ject of his admiration.
Before his arrival, Maud had conceived a secret preju-
dice against him, which was called forth by Mr. Marlowe's
daily advertisement, in which he was announced as "a
rich old widower, who was anxious to console himself in
his lonely estate by the appropriation of a second help-
meet," 't~tc. Daily contact only served to increase this
unjust prejudice, which, after some weeks, had grown
into a positive dislike.
Becoming decidedly uncomfortable~ under the steady
gaze of her vi&amp;dvis, that morning, she excused herself,)
after sipping a cup of coffee, and left the .breakfa~room,
hurriedly. A few moments after, the house was filled
with melody as a master-spirit presided at the piano. The
selection was "La Cascade," that weird f~t~is~ of
Pauer's, and the same under-current of feeling that in-
spired the composer evidently pervaded the pe~fo~xpr~
for the rendition of the piece was faultless. The nch~ -

chords with which it begins are quite suggestive of the
grand and silent depths of some vast forest, where one is
suddenly startled by the splashing and pattering of a
gentle waterfall, as it playf ally gurgles over its stony bed.
Thei~ as the pretty demi-semi-quavers glid&amp; harmoniously
into each other, the imitation of rippling water is so true,
that it seems to say:
"I chatter over stony ways
In little sharps and trebles;
I bubble into eddying bays,
I babble on the pebbles."
And finally, when the sound of the last note dies away,
&amp;ne is sadly reminded of the fact that the little stream is
lost also,*as it
"Flows on to join the brimming river."
During the performance Colonel llartridge had entered
~ hu~ even when' the pboe was finished he ex~
ehan~d no word with the performer, and the silent spell
o~f harmony resti~d upon them both.
&amp;4:aud was~ devotee to music, and it was fortunate that
her lonely heart, which ~ earning' for something to
love, could here expend its w th of passion. Hour after
hour, when sitting at ~he piaii6~vrapt in the melody which
floated around her, would she forget a~ her loneliness,
and her face would beam with the radiant happiness~ that
dwelt in he~~ soul.
~~There w~ silence still, and when looking through her
mu~ie fort some other selection, Colonel Hartridge stood
bythie instrument and said:

"So I see," was the smiling reply.
"But really and truly, it affects me as no other mushy
ever has~"
"You are very kind to say so ;" and for the first time
their eyes met, as she looked the thanks her lips failed to
utter.
This well-turned complimei~ was a fiag.of4rnce, ~nd a
smile still played in the corners of her mouth, as she
placed another selection upon the music-board. But just
then her coinpan ion preferred conversation, and quite to
her surprise he said:
"What a brilliant solitaire you wear!"
"Yes?" was the interrogatory reply, while her cheeks j
were dyed with crimson, and at' the same moment she
struck some chords on the ivory keys, to conceal her em~
barrassment.
Then, nothing daunted, he astonished her still more by
saying:
"Is rumor correct in naming the ring you ~wear an. eu
gagement ring?
"Colonel llartridge!" burst in surprise from her lips,
while her eyes reiterated her astonishment.
"You do not mind telling me, do you?"
This but provoked his listener still niore. Then, after~
looking searchingly at him for a moment, as if doubting
his sanity, she arose from the piano:
"You will pardon me," she said, "if I decline making.
a confidant of an utter stranger."
"It is tr~ue then?" he exclaimed; but she had vanishede,
and only an odor of violets filled the air, while a pair ~f

OW commonly it is for men to imagine that the

which do not end in weariness , and which point to an
enduring hereafter, which shall begin and end in ever~
lasting' joys? George thought that the possession of
Maud's love would make him the happiest of men, while
she believed that her joy would be complete, could her
1)arel)ts be restored, and so they both were thinking as
they drove slowly along a shaded road, which ran thrqngb
a dense forest, one summer evening.. The. fleet-footed..
Organs were covered with foam, and looked as if tl~ey
had had a long and a fast run. A light shower still left -
the rain-drops sparkling on the grass and wild-fiowers.-~
the dove cooed mournfully at a safe distance--.--the part..
ridge whistled .confidently from his hiding-piace--~-the
frogs croaked noisily from a marsh near by, and the
locusts screeched lazily from their refuge in the tree-tops..
All nature seemed smiling and happy, but it was from
no special good behavior on her part, for her la~w~ beh~g'
fixed and inevitable, she can never commit the trans~tesv
sions which, in the physical code, bring suffermg~&amp;
death to man.                                    -
George sympathized fujly with the ancient dame ~
her joyous mood, and all, things seemed to bear th
impress of his new-found bliss.
It is probable he was over-confident, though., for the
sad expression which rested upon INland's pale face, aii~7
the sighs which she strove to suppress, betofeued ~

however, being under the delicious spell which IQv~
first induces, George failed ~to observe Maud's sad an4 ~j
abstracted manner. At length, becoming restive uu4~.4~
the protracted silence, she said:
~" What makes you so quiet, George?"

"I am so happy, darling," and his eyes were beaming
with love, as he gazed admiringly into her averted face.
"I wish I could say the same," she sighed and. said.
"I hope you can, dearest," he replied, in the innocence
of his heart and the purity of his love.
"No, George," she answered sadly; "I cannot recall
a single happy hour, not even in childhood."
"Do not think of the past, then," he said, tenderly.
"I cannot forget the dark fate that cruelly deprived
me of my parents, and left me so desolate;" and her
voice trembled with unshed tears.
"0 Maud, do not refer to it," was the grieved reply.
But continuing, as if talking to herself, she said: -
"Neither can I ever forget those hard-hearted people,
who have so deeply embittered every hour of my life."
"For' my sake, darling, do not think of them;" and
could itliave been possible, his love would willingly have
plunged in oblivion. the unhappy recollections of his
cherished idol.
"Could you know, George, half the agony which I
have suffere~1, y~u would not be surprised to hear that I
have often prayed to die;" apd her beautiful brown eyes
were swimming in tears.
4Ake any true man, George loved her infinitely more
for her very loneliness, and longed to shield her from
further suffering, under the ~gis of his warm heart.
Drawing her to him, he said, tenderly:
"Promise me, my 'darling, never to refer to the past
again. - Promise me, 5 look forward to the future alone,
which I shall endeavor to make bright and cloudless for
~you. Do you promise?"
Without noticing his last question, she said:

Who IS 11APP4                 29
"George, there will always ba~0~ measuree at least, in
thinking of the past."
"What i~ that?" he asked, eagerly.
"Your friendship."
"Friendship indeed! say rather love, idolatry; for I
can scarcely recall an hour in. which Ii have not wurshipped
you.
Knowing how undeserving she was of such deep love~ his
words smote her, and she said:
"You should not worship anything but your God. It
is a sin"
"If I never commit a greater crime, I have no fears
about a home beyond the skies," was his joyous response.
"I am unworthy of ~o much love, George, for I do not
love as you do;" and Maud watched him closely to sceif
any suspicion of the true stat~ of her feelings~ darted
through his mii~d, for love i~ ever jealous, a~nd she hoped
he would awaken from his false dream himself. On the - -
contrary, he said, trustingly: -
"At present, dearest, I have a sufficent supply for both.
By and by, when I have made you
I have done something to merit your love, I will deman
the exchange."
"You are too good, George," she answered, and evad..
ing entirely the subject in question.
"I wish you would be equally good, and make me
supremely happy by naming our wedding-day."
Why did she start, then hurry to say, with averted face: ~
"Not this evening, George.'~
In a tone of disappointment, he said, "Is it always to
be thus?"
"Forgive me, George, if I have wounded yo~, and

attribute it to a sadness and depression which I cannot
throw off. I fear I must be ill."
"I hope not, dearest, although your hands are hot and
feverish," he said, pressing them.
They had now arrived at the entrance to Mr. Marlowe's
grounds, and IMlaud was sincerely glad that the deepening
twilight concealed her face from the searching eyes of
her lover. They had alighted~ and as they stood in the
starlight with clasped hands, George said:
"Am I not to come in?"
"Not this evening; I feel too badly."
"Do take care of yourself, darling," he said tenderly.
"I will call in the morning to see how you are."
"It will be iinnecessa~ry. Rest will restore me; good-
night."
"Good-~iight, darling," and pressing a kiss upon her
hand, h6 drove rapidly away, while she leant on the gate

b
the Marlowes.
What could be the attraction?
If peeping behind the curtain did not spoil the enjoy~
merit of the play, a surmise might be revealed, but then
t destroys the interest to anticipate, and 59 it is better to
forbear.
The advertisement had been inserted, and as IMlaud
waited day after day for a response, the time hung heavily
on her hands, and she longed for the hour which wrn~d
take her from under that roof forever. Her music~was a
source of great consolation, but yet she roamed absently
around, like some spirit doomed to walk in penance hero
awhile, before entering upon those joys which are to come~
hereafter.
Colonel Hartridge was neither blind nor slo~w of obser-
vation; and his heart was filled with sympathy for this.
lonely girl, who was the victim of such cold and unfeeling
people. But notwithstanding these kindly sentiments, ~11
heir frequent daily meetings, Maud repulsed him so de..
cidedly as to make him very uncomfortable. ~he en~
deavored to persuade herself that she disliked him, but at
the same time acknowledged that he was deeidegly~
superior to the numerous visitors with whom she mingled
at her o'nardian's house; and upon a self-investigation of
her estimate of him ,she found she rather admired him.
"But what had becoxhe of George ?"
Maud\sighed as she mentally asked this questio~r.
Feeling unusually sad and depressed, she lingered ~
a late one night over her music. After playing ~verA ;
wide range, from Mozart down to Verdi, she ~i~&amp;j41~Iy

concluded the evening with Gottschalk's "Last Hope."
There was a latent agony, and at the ~ame time a divine
resignation in the piece, which harrowed while it soothed
and the strange combination made it peculiarly fascinate
~ ing to her. While playing, the tears trickled slowly
down her cheeks, and as the last note floated away upon
the midnight air, she bowed her head upon the music-
rack and wept. The town clock pealed forth the hour
of twelve; but distance had so softened each stroke,
that they failed to arrest the attention of her who sat
there, "in silence and in tears."
The unmusical serenade of the Katydids jarred harshly
upon the stillness which pervaded all space, and one poor
little candle-fly flew around and around the lamp, caught
by the false glare, which lured it to its death. A star or
two peeped through the delicate lace curtains, the young
moon sent silvery, shimmering beams through the open
~indows, and silence reigned profound. It was the
season in which charnel-houses yield up their dead, and
had a ghostly figure, clothed in its winding-sheet, appeared
upon the scene, it would only have been in keeping with
the hour and the picture. But INland still leaned upon
the music-rack, and was so absorbed, that a gentle footfall
did not arouse her. The puritanical habits of the family,
the scarcity of visitors, ahd the lateness of the hour, all led
her to suppose herself free from intrusion. Imagine, then,
how startled she must have been, when a voice near her
said:
"In tears?"
The tone was sympathetic, ~nd in the familiar voice of
the speaker, she recognized Colonel Hartridge, who had

been spending the evening out, and had j~ist return4
Such a thing had never occurred before, and if INland j~
given him a thought she would have~ supposed him in the
land of dreams some hours before. Why should he have .~
spent this evening, of all others, away from home? and.
if so, why should be return so late?
Is there then indeed "a divinity that shapes our ends,
rough-hew them how we will"?
Trembling with fright at this unexpected interruption,
IMlaud lifted her tear-stained face to the Colonel but to
bury it again in her hands, while her whole frame was
convulsed with suppressed sobs.
Colonel Ilartridge was deeply moved, and Beating him.
self beside her, said kindly:
"Maud, tell me all that troubles you, and believe me, I
will be a friend to you."
But she could not speak for weeping, and yet these
words fell as soothingly upon her lonely heart as balm
poured into the gaping wound.
"I know what your life is here, for I have seen enough,
and my worst suspicions have been confirmed by what I
have heard. Do not be afraid to trust me, but tell me in
what way I can serve you."
Choking back her sobs she faltered out:
"Ion are too kind I "
"Prove that you believe ~what you say by confiding in
me."
"It will soon be over now, for I shall leave here in a
short tinie," she answered.
"For what?"
"To teach."
"To teach!" he exclaimed, and in mournful sympathy

added. "Poor child, you are young to battle with the
world."
"Yes; but I shall welcome the day which takes me
hence;" then remembering the lateness of the hour, she
arose. ~" I must go now, but allow me to thank you
sincerely for the unexpected sympathy you have extended
towards me;" and while her hand rested in~ his, she forced
back the tears which sprang to her eyes again.
"Maud, I love you, and would take you from the lonely
life you lead here," was the reply of this honest, straight-
forward man.
Was ever declaration of love more simple-more true?
Was she dreaming? Did she hear aright ~' And as sur~
prise suc~ed~'d astonishmentshe gazed into his face with
a bewild6r~ look, but to see his words reiterated in the
frank expression which beamed therefrom. There could
be no deception in those eyes so wonderfully mirroring
the deep emotiQn~ which stirred his saul and she was
reassured of it, when he continued:
"Will you come with me? I have a home in which
you shall reign-queen. My wealth shall be at your
eoinmaud, and the dark days you have known here shall
be blotted from memory, by new and ever-changing
pleasures. Will you be mine, Maud?" and he pressed the
hand that lay in his, tP his lips.
She cEorgot in that hour how she had disliked him. She
ignored the difference in their years, and thought only of
the kind words which fell like a soothing benediction
upon her hungry soul. Yet it was so unexpected that her
lips c6uld not frame a, reply, and she stood before him
trembling like a frightened bird, and blushing in coy,
half shamefacedness. At length she looked trustingly

"IN SILENCE AND IN TI~AR5.~~
up into the manly face, that watched her ev~ry breatb,
and murmured innocently, as if not knowing what else to
say:
"I must go now."
"Not without a promise," said he, detaining her quiv.
ering hand.
"Will you answer me to-morrow?"
"To-morrow !" she 'echoed, as if not, comprehending
exactly what lie said.
"Yes, to-morrow. Will you to-morrow answer what I
have asked you to-night?"
"Yes," he whispered. "Good-night!" and was gone.
Sitting down by a window in the moonlight, he thought
on wh~t he had done; and no regret mingled with iho
joy tJ4t filled his heart.
SI~ was beautiful, he loved her. She was lonely, he
would comfort her. But would she permit it?
"Aye-there was the rub 1" The future only ceuld
tell.
The young girl who had just parted from him sat also
in the moonlight-and thinking too. But the one ab~
scoring topic of her thoughts was the prospect of quitting
forever that hated roof. She cared little whose hand it
might be who should release her from the thraldom of
mind and spirit by which she was tortured, so it was ae~
coinplished; and her dreams wer&amp; only of anticipated
release, such as the caged bird may be supposed to-
experience.

FRAILTY7 THY NAME 15 WOMAN!~~
AIITD was a living example of this stinging epi~
gram, as she sat'one morning reflecting.
her reflections were rather complicated, for
she found herself the unintentional and double object of
two engagements, and in what manner to dismiss the one,
* was much more perplexing than the consummation of
matters with the other. It was quite evident that she
could not be married to both of them; the moral code'
forbid!
at To break the news as gently as possible to George, and
the same time to retain his friendship, was the earnest
Aesire of her heart, but could it be accomplished, and if
so, how? He had been the friend of tier childhood, her
girlhood,. and the avowed lover of her womanhood. Did
~ it not seem like heartless ino'ratitude to abandon him fQr
a stranger?
It is to be regretted, that women are guilty of such
irregularities, but when the false education which teaches~
them to be. so utterly regardless of their word is remein-

love of adulation which is the bane of so many, and would
make earnest women instead of frivolous pleasure-seekei~.
Under the present r4gim~, how few women contemplate

marriage with any degree of seriousness. ~1'hey coquette /
with first one and another, until waning beauty warns
I them to "make their fortune," as it is called, ere it is too ~
late. \$~'hen, with a sigh, at leaving all their former free~ /

dom, they wed some suitor, perchance for money or posi- /
~ tion, and without ever giving a thought to the duties ,~'
which nmst devolve upon wife and mother. itt thef
same spirit of rashness, they forget that marriage i~ ~
lifetime business, and not the folly of a day, which ma~
be repented of, and committed no more.
The intention is not to make this picture general, but
every one knows some instances which answer'~he de~
~ription, to say nothing of the hasty and ill-considered
match&amp;which daily occur, and which must as surely end
in unhappiness, it is a rite as ancient as the world, and
sanctioned as it is by the holy approval of Divinity, should
be entered into with great solemnity.
Maud did not love Ge6rge as a woman should love the
man to whom she is to be united in wedlock, and no re~
proach could have clirno' to her for this.~ But. she and all
'~other women should be~ censured for encouraging the
honest love of men, when they know they can never re-
ciprocate it.t~ Here is where the dishon6'r lies. It is true,
George took ~Maud's love quite as a matter of course; but
then she might and ought to have undeceived 'him. Did
she love the man to whom she was to be married? flee
heart was touched by his generous sympathy, but did i~
never occur to her that she would have, left that house
under almost any circumstances? Were these the only
feelings which she expected to sustain her in, all the long
years which were yet to Zeome? Heaven forbid!
She saw little of George nowadt~ys, for some excuse

turned, him away almost every' time he called, but his
eonfklirig nature suspected nothing, and whenever Maud
1t~d offered him his ring, he had as often forced it back
up~rn her finger; then ~Iie would blush, look quietly, and
say nothing, and he was happy in the belief that he was
belevod.
Yt~cillation was crime here, was it not? Just at this
uncomfortable stage of her reflections, Mr. Marlowe
entered the library where she sat, with an open letter in
'..~ his hand, and advancing to her said,-
"I received an ansxver to my advertisement this morn~
ing, from the President of the Female College at L-
lie offers you a situation as assistant teacher of music,
~ith a salary of three hundred dollars a year. It will
bai~ely pay your board, but that's better than doing noth-.
ing."
Trembling from head to foot, she took the letter from
his hand, and said timidly,-
"Thank you-"
"Thank you yes, or no? Which do you mean? Don't
keep inc waiting when I have told you every thing that
is in the letter. Tell me what reply I am to make-of
course you are going;" and his eyes danced at the very
thought of being rid of this daily reminder of his in-.
famy.
"I am very much obliged to you, but-but L-." and
like a frightened child she could say no more.
"But what? Out with it-out with it, and don't stand
~there stammering and trembling '~s if you were afraid to
speak; I've. never seen a woman who was afraid to do
that yet," and his words were accompanied with meuac~

"I shall not teach now," and she trembled as though
confronting the arch..flend himself.
"Not teach?" was the amazed exclamation. "What
will you do, then? Do nothing and starve, I suppose;"
and the sneer which parted his lips and made him more
repulsive than ever was significant of The secret dread he
entertained, lest she should remain a dependent upon his
bounty for an indefinite period of time.
Maud was burning with indignation, but by a grea$
effort she controlled herself, and said, with apparent
composure, "I beg that you. will give yourself no further
trouble in regard to me, as I am-to be-married soon."
As surprise succeeded indignation, he said:
"But ~[ thought you told me George Stanley had never
addressed you?"
"Is he the only man in the world?" was the quiek
rejoinder.
"The only one who would ever be fool enough to
court you," was the ungentlemanly retort.
11ev blood boiled at this merciless tannt~, and yet she
was completely in his power, without the necessary means'
to quit his. home, or friends to ~.y to, and even at that
moment with relief in sight~ her lonely and unprotected
situation was experienced more bitterly than ever. For
several minutes they stood eying each other in silence,
as two antao'onists might do before the deadly contest
begins; then drawing herself proudly and defiantly ~np,
she said,-
"Mr. Marlowe, I have endured your taunts and insults

far, you haVe embittered my whole life, and this CO~c
ardly p~u't has been enacted all the better, because you
thought I had no one to defend me-to-day it must end;
~an~d I am happy ~o inform you, that a few weeks hence,
Colonel llartridge, as my husband, will protect me against
any more of your insults."
The doors being open, these last words reached the ear
of a certain visitor, as he descended the stairs, and
instaut~y recognizing the familiar tones of Maud's voice,
he entered the room unannounced, and* standing by her
side said,-
"lie is here to do it now."
A cry of delight broke from her lips, and as he slipped
his arm protectingly around her waist, her head sank upon
his shoulder, and the tears which could be restrained no
longer, burst forth. Marlowe was livid with ~uppressed
rage, but in the sudden presence of Colonel Iiartridge
his face became wreathed with smiles, thus giving an
ocular demonstration of how a man can "smile and smile,
and be a villain still."
hi the twinkling of an eye, he changed his tactics, and
with the best expression he could command, said, "Well,
really, I must congratulate you both upon this unexpected
but happy state of affairs," at the same time extending his
hands to them in a friendly way. They were hastily
withdrawn, as neither friend nor ward accepted the peace
offering, and he retired a pace or two, as Colonel hart..
ridge said,-
* "I must reject both your proffered hands and congrat~
ulations, Mr. Marlowe, until I know the cause of the dif4
faculty which my timely presence terminated."
"Oh, it was nothing," said Marlowe, with a forced smii~

*
"only a slight misunderstanding between Maud and mya
self. Come now, we must not quarrel-let us be friends."
But Colonel Hartridge maintained a sullen silence, and.
an uncompromising manner, while Maud attempted to dry
her tears, and Marlowe looked as uncomfortable as he felt.
They were all becoming quite nervous under the pr9tract-
ed silence, when Mr. Marlowe made a final attempt at re~~
conciliation, by saying:
"Come, child, forgive me if I wounded you, for I did
not intend to. Come, Colonel, we have nothing to quar-
rel about. Come now, shake hands with an old man, who
hopes he may not sue iii vain for pardon;" and as he ex-
tended his hands again, a spirit of magnanimity, which ho
was unable to appreciate, prompted both Naud and the
Colonel to pi~ess them, and grant him that mercy which he
never exercised towards others. But the reconciliation
was only partial, for Maud's heart ached with bitter mem-
ories, and Colonel llartridge suspected that there was
more behind the scenes ~hau he yet knew. Nothing was
said for a little while, until Marlowe broke th~ silence by.
saying,-.
"Now that you have forgiven me, I will no longer in.-
trude;" but as he left the room, Colonel llartridge joined
him, and when in the hall, said,-
"Mr. Marlowe, I have made honorable proposals to
your ward, and she has consented to become my wife at
an early day. I shall demand an explanation of her, and
if it confirms my suspicions of your treatment towards
her, I shall \hlold you personally responsible, sir."
lie was pale with ano-er as he spoke, and Marlowe wa~
mute with terror.
"For, my sake, let there be no more of this," said Mand

joining them. "Pray, let Mr. Marlowe go, and I will ex
plain everything to you;" for, although she knew ho~v
unjustly he had treated her, yet it was her sincere desire
now to prevent a difficulty for what was past, and could
not 1)0 helped.
"That's right, child-that's right, child," said Marlowe,
as he trenibled with fear. "You know I would not harm
a hair of your head; you know how good I have always
been to you, and how fond I always was of you, don't you,
child? You can make it all right with the Colonel, can't
you, Maud?"
"Oh! yes," she said, quickly and impatiently. "Go
on, please-go on, and I'll make it all right," and with
these words she gently drew Colonel llartridge back into
the lil)rarv, while Marlowe made a hasty retreat.
"Well now, Matfd, since you have taken this matter in
your own hands, I would like to know what it all means,"
said the Colonel, as they seated themselves. But the ex-
~itoment had l)een too much for her, and the depression
which generally succeeds such scenes now manifested it-
self in a fresh burst of tears. A natural delicacy induced
the Colonel to forbear pressing an answer~so he waited
until she was sufficiently calm to speak. After a while,
between half-smothered sobs and falling tears, she said,
"I assure you it~ is nothing. I believe it is not new or
strange for a ward and her guardian to be at variance."
"But it is something entirely new to me, for a man to
insult a la~1y and go unpunished," was the gallant reply.
"I should have become hardened to 'it in this time, for~
I have knowii little else since misfortune and a father's
ignorance placed me beneath this r~of twelve years ago.
I caun~t force myself to believe that he knew these peo.

pie as I do, or he would have talent me down into tho
grave with him, rather than left me in their care;" and
the tears gushed afresh.
"You shall leave here instantly," said the Colonel.
"But I have nowhere to go," she said, as she remem
bered with bitterness the indifference of her relatives,
and the scarcity of her friends.
"You shall come with me. What's the difference be-
tween now and a few weeks hence?" and folding her to
his heart, lie kissed her beautiful brow with pride.
"Bat I am not prepared;" and then, as she thought of
her poverty, an expression of pain came over her face, and
she said, "I have no trousseau.~~
"That is of no consequence. Can it not be made after
marriage, as well as before?"
"It is not customary," she said, blushing deeply; then
added quickly, "If I had my preference, it would be, to
be married in a travelling suit, and leave at once."
"how long will it require to have the travelling suit
made?" asked the Colonel eagerly.
"A day-or two days at farthest."
"Get your hat; we will go and order it at once, and in
two days' time will leave this accursed place forever. Do
not worry about your trou~eau, for I will give you a
carte-blanche to purchase it a week hence in New York."
"Youi. are too good," said Maud, looking timidly up in
his face. "No one has ever been so kind to me before,"
and for the moment ~he forgot a certain life-long friend,
who had been the only sunbeam across her darkened path.

THE FEVER OF DELIGHT.

TIE sky was cloudless, and the sun was unusually
brilliant, as it flooded the village of M-' one
~wuiflg, in its golden beams. The dew still
glistened on tho grass, and the wild woods rang with the
matin songs of birds, but Colonel and Mrs. Ilartridge
were many miles away, the ceremony having been per-
formed at day~ dawn, and the train bore them swiftly on
their bridal tour. It had been the dream of Maud's life
to travel, to visit art-galleries, to linger in libraries, and
to study the men and women who compose the great world.
Now that this wish was to be so suddenly realized, she
could scarcely believe it. The transformation had been so
rapid that her brain was in a whirl; she was in a fever
of delight, but, not belonging to the ecstatic~ school, l~er
enjoyment was quiet rather than demQnstrative-it was
the fever of the soul, drinking in deep, but silent
draughts, as is always the case with the true lover.
Colonel Ilartridge, who had travelled extensively, both
in the Old and New Worlds, saw nothing specially worthy
of note, so doze4 over his papers, and occasionally smiled
proudly upon hi~ "beauteous bride."
They were the most quiet couple imaginable, and a
mere' looker-on might have concluded, naturally enoi~gh,
that they had been married for years, instead of a few
days. Upon their arrival in New York, a beautiful t~oua-
sein.&amp; was furnished thb bride, tether with jewels of the
rarest devices. It wasall so new and strange tQ her, though,

f
TIlE FEVER OF DELIGHT.
that each fresh token of love was received with the tears
which spring from a grateful heart. From the Metropo-
lis they sallied forth upon the tour common to pleasure
seekers, and so rapidly did they travel that it seemed as
though gazing at kaleidoscopic views, which changed
while they still looked, thus causing that flrs~ launch on
the broad ocean of life to appear to Maud like some
gorgeous vision, which was too beautiful to last. Col-
onel Ilartridge was all goodness and kindness, but he and
his young wife were unusually reticent towards each
other, and Maud found, to her chagriu, that she conversed
fluently with others, while at a loss to talk to her husband.
Married people should struggle against this state of things
with all the earnestness of their souls, for thus living to-
gether and yet apart, may eventually lead to misplaced
confidences. They should know every thought of each
other's hearts, and no one else should own the sacred'
privilege of entering the "sanctum sanctorum." The
human heart must and will have sympathy and love, and
perchance it may l)e bought at a price which would be
fearful, even to whisper. Talk about self-sufficiency!
there is no such thing, for the holy Book says, "no m~n
liveth unto himself, and no man dieth unto himself."
They who prate of being self-supporting may deceive the
world, and hide.~ from its curious gaze the yearning for
congeniality and affection which burns within their hearts,
but the feeling will be there all the same, and the clamor
will' never cease, until silenced by love expended, and love
returned.

on board ship, and anchored in sight of the gem of Geor
gia, the "Forest City!" The sail from New York had
been pleasant, but entirely devoid of any incident worth
mentioning. Maud had won the hearts of the passengers
by her kindness and charm of manner, and thus moving
in the circle which she was born to grape, her timidity
was fast yielding to an ease and elegance of manner
which is only found in refined and polished society. her
beauty elicited much admiration, and it was already evi~
dent that she was destined to become a favorite. She
1~oked unusually lovely that day, as standing on deck
her eyes turned longingly to the spot that was to be her
future home.
"A penny for your thoughts, Maud," said her husband
just then.
"I was wondering if my intuition could designate the
location of my future home."
"I certainly hope that your intuition will do nothing
of the kind, as I desire that honor myself; besides, you
cannot see the private, residences from here."
A sweet smile and a look of gratitude expressed what
she felt, but did not say. After landing, adieux were
hastily spoken, and in the confusion ~. securing luggage,
and gai fling the carriage, the subject was dropped, and
not renewed. -
From the wharf to the door of his residence, the' Cob
onel was bowing and smiling to old friends, while Maud
leant back in the carnage, and feasted her eyes upon the
beauties which burst upon her at every step, and which
forced her, at first sight, to believe all and more than she
had yet been fold of this "Kingdom by the Sea." Eu~
tin~ely oblivious of the admiring glances which were be~

stowed upon her, she was entertained by examining the
stately residences empowered in vines and evergreens;
by looking at the broad avenues, with their double rows of
forest trees, and by watching the myriads of children
playing in the squares. These pleasurable impressions
increased with each step, until the acme of her dreams
was realized, as stopping near the "Pulaski Monument"
Forsyth Park" lay spread out before them in all its
1)eanty and loveliness. The gorgeous tints of gold and
red foliage were heightened by a brilliant autumnal sun,
the fountain splashed and danced like so many diamond
dew-drops, and in a burst of enthusiasm Maud exclaimed:
"how beautiful! Why it's fairy-land!" and as she
drank in the whole picture with the discrimination of
her poetic nature, her husband watched her, and was'
happy in her happiness.
Failing to observe that the carriage had stopped, she
was a little startled when her husband said:
"Maud, we are home!,'
Looking 'around then, for the first time, she saw that
they had di'awn up before a palatial residenc9, and hastily
alighting they entered their' beautiful home.
When within the vestibule, the Colonel folded his fair
young bride to his heart, and said, kindly:
"Mand, everything here Js yours, and my prayer is
that you may find it in truth, "Home, sweet home."
"I echo your prayer, for it is something~ I have never
known;" a~nd for the first time in two months the team
sprang into, her eyes.
Was it a happy or unhappy omen to enter her future
home thus tearfully?
"Are you too tired to walk over the h~use1" ~U

asked in a considerate manner, as she stood in the v~sti.
~ bule examining some statues which filled the niches.
"Oh, no," was the cheerfuljesponse, "I shall be only
too happy to be introduced at once to my new, or rather,
J$rst home."
"Let bygones be bygones, Maud, and try, for my sake
to be happy in the present."
In making a hasty survey of the rooffis, she saw
that all the appointments ~were in the richest, as well as
most tasteful keeping. The walls of the rooms, as well
as those of the halls, were artistically frescoed-the car-
pets were of the rarest Turkish designs, while copies
from the old masters were gracefully suspended from
the walls; antiques and French bronzes adorned the man-
tels, and all things bespoke wealth and refinement of taste.
At length they stood iii the sitting-room, and as ColoneL
lllartridge opened a window which led into the ~onserva~
tory, the most delicious odors filled the air, while a canary
that hung in an orange tree trilled a merry welcome, and
a miniature fountain sent gentle sprays of water softly
upwards.
"Do I dream, or is it reality?" said Maud, as her very
soul drank in the beauties by which she was surrounded.
"It is reality, INland, and all yours," said the Colonel,
with a smile of intense satisfaction.
"Everything is so bea~itiful-so new and strange-sc
different from my dull, cold life at th~ Marlowes'-that
I think I must be dreaming. I will go to my room now,
and to-morrqw will finish the survey of my fairy doma~ins.

ness, as he leant over and kissed her brow.
"I prefer being alone, for I am really very weary."
"Why, certainly; come, and 1 will show you. to your
rooms.~,
As they ascended the stairs to her apartments, new
beauties greeted her at every step, until she felt that she
would like to close her pyes, and see no more, for that
day at least. While removing her hat and wrappings,
the Colonel said:
"1 will leave you npw, Maud, for a sight of my long-
deserted office. Try an~ get a nap, and be bright at din-

"Ko, thank you, nothing ~now."
"Good-by, then;" and a moment afterwards the door
closed, and she was alone. Springing up, and turning
the bolt, she threw herself upon the bed and wept9 Was
it from nervousness, from undue excitement, or from
some undefined foreboding? Thht such emotions at that
hour were' ungrateful, she acknowledged, but there are
some moments in life when the feelings burst forth in a

wealth could purchase, what more could be desired?

THE FEVER OF DELIRIUM.
N a darkened chamber a man lay ill unto death.
It was the hour of midnight, but the watchers
showed no signs of~ drowsiness. The physician
walked slowly, and noiselessly about the room, and his
eyes were cast down, his hands folded behind him, and
1 us face betokened unusual anxiety. An elderly woman
sat before the fire, iii an arm-chair. witfr her face buried
in her hands; and her low~ sobs, and heart-rending sighs,
were but faint expressions of a mother's agony.
A young woman sat by the bedside, pressing a bag of
ice to the temples of the sufferer with one hand, while
with the other she vainly strove to keep the cover drawn
over him. Sometimes he would cry out in all the agony
of conscious~ pain, at intervals lie would grow quiet and
seem to be sleeping; and again, springing from the bed
with superhuman strength, he would defy the power of
his nurses to hold him, and rushing up and down the
room like a madman, shriek out:
"Thud! Maud! Mand! Maud!"
This would continue until, exhausted, he would sink
into the arms of his physician, and by him be replaced
in his bed, like a little child.
"Curses on tl~at woman," muttered old Mrs. Stanlc~, as
she bent anxiously over her only son.
"Oh, mother!" cried her daughter in a tone of pain
and disapproval.
" With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured~ to

you again," said Mrs. Stanley, as if COmi~uning with hei
own conscience; "and my prayer shall be that Maud Liv-
iifgstone shall have to drink of the same cup of bitterness
which she has so remorselessly held to our lips."*
"Oh, mother! dear mother, do not talk so again,"
pleaded Mary, for she knew that that was not the spirit
of Christ, which teaches men the divine nature of f~r~
giveness.
It had now been a month since the marriage of Maud
had taken place, and in that fact can be discovered tho
cause, indirect and direct, of George Stanley's subse~~juent
dissipation and illness. When disease had finally made
him powerless to resist or evade the kind entreaties of his
mother and sister, they were enabled to keep him yt home,.~
and not till then.
It was during his illness that Mary had discovered in
the pocket of oze of his vests a crumpled and soiled note
which ran thus:
"DEAR GICoRGE:
I return your ring, and earne~tly beg pardon if I
have misled you in regard to the true state of my feel-
ings. I have always loved you as a brother, and as long
as life lasts shall evet~ remember your unwavering kindness,
to me. IToping our old relations may remain unchanged,

day of her marriage and departure. Of course he- de

ascribed to the young lover, in the most triumphant man.
ncr, the happiness of the bridegroom, and, to his astonish'
ment, the startling intelligence was received without corn~
ment.
George seemed as one petrified. ills heart stood still,
and his tongue refused to give utterance to the thoughts
which burned and seethed within him. He wondered if
he had suddenly become demented, and asked himself
whether or not his senses deceived him.
And still old Marlowe talked of Mand-of llartridge
-of his money-but George was silent, not even reply-
ing to the taunt of hi~ tormentor, when he said:
"It is a pity, Stanley, you let the old man cut you
At these words th~ two men parted, and while Marlowe
betook himself to some fresh scheming, the boy-lover fled
on and on-~he scarcely knew whither. His heart was
numb and cold rather than bleeding; his brain seemed
chilled, and throbbed with slow pulses of despair; and
when he found that his unguided footsteps had led him to
the village cemetery, a strong impulse was upon him to end
his unhappy life, and take up his abode in the "City of
the Dead."
Following his instincts, he soon reached th? family sec-
tion, and cast hiniself in mute grief at the foot of his
father's grave.
lit was the first great sorrow of a boyish heart, that was
as trusting and confiding a~ that of a child. It was the
first great disappointment which had yet~ darkened ~his
young life, and the cross was heavy, and the cup he
*     drained filled with the bitterest of bitterness. When the
fir~t outbreak of the surcharging of his pent-up feelings

bad gushed forth and subsided, he tore open the note
and, with hot, tearless eyes, read the words which forever
dispelled the gay illusions of his youthful dreams. His
trust in mankind was gone: the world was only a blank
to Win-a meaningless page-a noisome bedlam: ho
prayed to die!
lie did not have sufficient force of character to endure
sileiiee, nor yet the 'courage to take the life he would so
willingly have resigned, in this moment of~overmastering
weakness; and so from his honored father's resting-place
he weiit forth, in a sort of stupid mania, and sought the
lethe of oblivion in potent liquors.
Maud's ingratitude to him made 'all the world appear
false. lie did not pause to reflect how much of her love
he had taken for granted; lie only knew he loved her
wildly, madly; he only felt that she was lost to hiin-lost
forever.
There is nothing, happily, in after life, which can
brino' with it the keen suffering' of the first disappoint.
ment. Before that the world seems bright and joyous,
despite phantom vagaries; after that the victim goes
forth with a cloud over his pathway-~a shadow on hi~
soul. Life is never the -same, and he is never the same.
So absorbed was George in his own- reflections, that
time slipped by unnoticed, and when he returned to the
village, the sun had sunk in the vest, and earth was
drawing around her the dusky veil of twilight.
Entering the first one of those vile dens, called "bar~
rooms," that curse the land, he called for brandy, and
drank until his reason was dethroned, and memory, with
all its haunting of the past, was drowned. It had been
a rare thing for him to partake even of a "social ~

so a small quantity, comparatively, of the fiery potion di~
the work.
After some hours of ..uproarious merriment, he SnC*
cumbed to the stronger power, and would have fallen to
the floor but for the aid of the bar-keeper, who placed hi in
upon his own bed, as he thought, with a gleam of tri-
uniiph, of the rich prize he had secured in this new con-
vert to the vile habits which enriched his coffers.
The news of Maud Livingstone's unexpected marriage
soon spread over all the village and when George failed to
return to his home at the wanted hour, the hearts of his
motheiT and sister were filled with anxious fears. 'When
the day had passed into the night and he caine not, they
were frantic. Seeking their nearest neighbor, Mary ex~
planned the appr~nsions of her mother and herself, and
besought him to go with her in search of her brother.
But, after insisting upon her return home arid escorting
her himself, this tried friend started on what seemed at
first a fruitless mission. No one had seen George since
early morning, and as ho never frequented thb haunts of
drink, the thought did not suggestt itself that he might be
an unconscious inmate of one of them. After several
hours his retreat was discovered, and aboQt two o'clock
heAvas borne, in a state of insensibility, to his home.
The first tears shed over a son gone astray are like the
first griefs, the bitterest; and such were the tears that
Mrs. Stanley shed over poor, helpless George; tears,

him, and raising up he looked at them for a moment, then
falling back, closed his eyes without speaking.
"What will my darling boy have?" tenderly asked hi~
mother.
"Nothing," lie replied huskily.
"Tell sister what troubles you," said Mary, in the
gentle playfuhiess of their childhood, as she took his
feverish hand and stroked it between her cool palms.
"Don't you know, sister?" he asked, and turning his
head a~vay he groaned heavily.
"'Will you ~iot have some breakfast,~yson~"saidhi~
anxious mother.
"Breakfast, mother? why, how could I eat?"
It was a sad little household .on that morning, and time
only made it sadder. Soon the mother and sister retired
from the room, and, after making his toilette, George'
joined them; but their hearts were too full for the usual
tide of family conversation, they noted the restless,, fitful
maimer with which he wandered fm'orn room to room,
with no intent, in silence. Ills thoughts were wholly hi~
own, and a cloud of gloom, like a funeral pall, spread over
the usually happy household.
Against the earnest protestations of both mother and
sister, George left the house, and again, before niightfaU,
found relief from his oppression in tempting drink. 'riiis
was but the beginning of a series of the most sickening
debaucheries, an account of which would prove too revolt~

And yet there are a small class- who do not be-

with absolutely nothing to do; their chief occupation con-
sisting in devising means of passing the time, which hangs
'so heavily ~ipon their pampered idleness.
Were these women educated to comprehend that
"Life is real, life is earnest,"

~'~TOT1JELNG TO DO."'         57
they might be zealous workers in the great vineyard.
But sb long as the present superficial system of instruction
continues, so long as women are reared with the idea that
they have nothing to do but cultivate their physical
beauty, dress, and run the gauntlet of the marriage mar-
ket to advantage, just so long will they be the giddy but-.
terilies of fashion one finds them; with now and then an
earnest soul struggling for something higher, only to be
dragged down by gossips and critics. The ballot-box is
not what is asked for not what is needed, but a more
thorough education for women.' Is it not the mother who
has the training of her offspring? She must not be un-
sexed in the blind wisdom of fanaticism, nor robbed of a
single feminine attribute, but to make "a perfect womam
nobly planned," she must be intellectua~y, but not ma~
cuhinely strong. She must be allotted some nobler mis.
sion in life than conjuring up frivolous, and consequently~
pernicious, ways of disposing of her time.
They say they have "nothing to do."
Nothing to do, when there is so much to be done?
much misery to alleviate, so many heart-aches to soothe?
When there are souls to save ?-when, perhaps, they are.
endowed with the" ten talents"? Oh, daughter of Time,
remember they will be required at the end, and do not
forget the fate of the 'barren fig-tree.
Every human being has duties. To sit idling erie's
time away is a grievous omission, to say the least of it;
and judging by Christ's estimate, will be accounted as ~in~
As is usual with people who have absolutely nothing to
do, Maud Irartridge became fascinated with the round of
gayety in which she lived; and found that time hung
grievously heavy on her hands, unless there was some e~*

excitement or amusement always in contemplation. On one
of these many idle days she lingered with Guy Witherell
in the breakfast-room, talking. Colonel Ilartridge had
gone to his business long before, as had every one else
who was so fortunate as to have any. As Guy had neither
duties nor employment, it was natural that he should
seek the society of those similarly situated; and thus it
was that he wasted the golden hours of his youth, either
in the society of frivolous women, or with those gentlemen
of elegant leisure, who lounged around hotels, drove fast
horses, and frequented club-houses, lie was but a type
of a certain class of young men, who have no higher am-
bition than to live in idle extravagance upon the hard-
earned savings, which, by industry and economy, their
fathers have amassed. lIe had a good mind, and l)y
study and application, could have gained an honorable if
not an eminent position among his fellow-men. his father
had given him the best advantages, and had expended
large sums of money upon his education. But, cui bono?
his highest aspiration seemed to be to make a clown of
himself, for the amusement of the crowd into which he
might chance tu fall-'4o "pick the banjo;" to "fiddle" a
little; sing a good deal, and do nothing, generally. No
amount of entreaty from his mother, nor threatening from
hiss father, could induce him to change his course; and.
thus he ~vent on his way rejoicing. Being a cousin of the
first wife of Colonel llartridge, he had always been inti-
mate at the house, and it soon became an establishedifact,
that when in disgrace at home, he took refuge under the
roof of his quasi cousin. The young ladies ~raved about
his "love of a mustache," and declared that his mis-
chievous blue eyes committed sad havoc with their hearts

(

He was accordingly, exceedingly vain, and exerted his
wonderful powers on willing subjects. His diminutive
size prevented him frdm ever being accounted a hero or a
soldier, but lie seemed content to play the r51e of carpet~
knight, and hear silly women declare he was "the dearest
little fellow in the world."
In reply to remonstrance from his parents, Guy would
say,-
"What difference does it make whether ; I do anything
or not? I am just as highly respected as the most ol
men. My associations are with the 'first people,' and I
am sure I have the undisputed entree of the 'best so-
ciety.' So what does it matter?" True, but he forgot,
or failed to realize, that his position was purchased with
his father's gold. What if those riches should "tak~
unto themselves wings and fly away"? It is altogether
possible, nay highly probable, that the doors of the "first
people" would be closed against, and the entree into the
best society denied him. He would then necessarily be
thrown upon his own resources, and what talents he had
been endowed with by nature would be called into re-
quisition, perhaps, to keep him from starving. It is an
np-lull business either to study a profession, or fornm habits.
of industry late in life; and those who make the attempt
find this inevitably true. No more mornings idled away
in silly talk to idle pretty women; no more lounging
around hotels, but. work, work must be the order of the
day. Why is it that the purse-proud sneer at those who
labor, and contemptuously esteem them niere drudges-.
"hewers of' wood and drawers of water" for the more
dubiously fortunate? Was anything good, great, or
glorious ever accomplished without daily apphicatio~j ~

Then such efforts should be encouraged, instead of being
condemned. On the other hand, if a man works his.
up in the world, he will steadily hold his position, and be
altogether independent of the freaks of the fickle goddess.
If she frowns upon him, he laughs in her face, and whis-
tles her threatening down the wind, lie is strong enough
to fight out the battle of life alone, no matter how fierce
the contest, or weary the marches, or steep the ram-
parts. lIe reaches Fame's summits at last, and the gra-
cious world is proud to come down from jts stilts and
recognize his powers. But once on the heights, he can
edefy the captious who worship from afar, or snarl in envy
at the prosperous.

It is matter of more than regret that' women should
fritter away their time in scandal and fashion, with no
aim nor object in view* but for men who have every ave-

With the easy manner of being quite :at home, Guy
had thrown himself on a lounge, and was evidently enjoy~
ing to the fullest extent the fragrant cigar he held be-
tween his sans souci lips.
IMland was sitting near him, listening, rather than talk-
- ing, and petting her two dogs. "Tiny," a little black~
and-tan terrier, .~ nestled cosily in her lap, and as she
stroked her, "Carl," a splendid Xewfoundland, laid at
her feet; and' looking wistfully up into her face, seemed
tosay: "Love motoo!"
An affectionate stroke now and then, on his head, quite
satisfied his jealousy, and closing his great black eyes,

he fell asleep. Just then, Guy was saying, "Come, co;
don't worry about 'Lucille;' her foot will soon be welL"
"I am sure I hope so."
"And if it isn't, I'll try my skill upon it."
"Thanks, Guy; I wish you w' old. For aside from
her suffering, I miss my daily ride sadly."
"And mine are very lonely without you. It has 110W
been more than a week since our last ride to I3onaven~
ture."
"Oh, that weird, lovely spot, that beautiful 'city of the
dead.' It has haunted my memory ever since we were
last there!"
She closed her eyes as if to recall the beauteous picture,
which was firmly engraved upon her recollection, and
then opening them, said, a little sadly and in much eam
nestness:
"It would almost reconcile me to dying, if I knew It
could be buried there, with those grand~ old oaks keeping
sleepless vigil over me, and the long moss, as it sways
in the winds, chanting never-ending requiems."
Were her words prophetic, or only some idle fancy of
*tbe brain?
"Well, I. am quite sure if I could be translated, to say
nothing of suffering, dying, and being buried, I should
not be reconciled to the thought of leaving this wodd~
It is good enough for inc."
But Maud did not notice Guy's reply. Her thoughts
seemed wandering, and she gazed vacantly into space.
For a few ijilmites not a word was spoken; but the si~
lence was at length broken by Guy.
"Well, if you intend to sit there looking as mournful
as if you had seen your grandmother's ghost, and talking#

a hasty exit.
"Oh, Guy!" fell faintly upon his ears, as he reached
the front door, and smiling, said to himself triumphantly,
"too late! ~na lelle."
An unusual depression played upon Maud's spirits,
that morning, and she roamed around the house as if in
search of something, she scarce knew what. At length,
the syren music enticed her, and in its soothing melodies
she quaffed "the kind nepenthe," for which her restless
and weary soul thirsted.
Thus day after day passed away, and when the calen-
dar had told six mouths, they seemed not as many days.

rally came from his office. lie seemed in unusually
buoyant spirits, as laughing, lie said:
"See, Maud, read the P. S. to this letter and say what
~ shall do."
Taking the opeu letter from his hand, she read ~
"If you come up-country this summer, we shall be glad
to see you with iNtaud at our house.
Again, truly yours,
J~ T. MAL~own."
The bitter recollections of the dreary years that were
past and gone, rushed over her like a torrent; and filled
with these memories, she tossed the letter aside, aud said,
with deep feeling'
"I would rather die thaii ever enter tiiat house again!"
"Why, Maud ?" said her husband, laughing at the
childish impatience of her manner, as he stooped to pick
up the despised missive she had dropped from her hand,
as if its touch might defile; "iou must forgive, even as
you hope to be forgiven. Why may we not stop a day9r
two to see the Marlowes on our route up to Lookout?"
and he folded her in his arms as though she were a fright-
ened bird. 11cr head rested confidingly on his shoulder,
and the tears sprang to ~ier eyes, but her lips were sealed.
Thus a few minutes passed, then gently lifting her head
and looking into her eyes, lie said:
"Will you not do this for my sake?"
I~emernb~ring all his goodness and 1oving-kindnes~ to
he~ she said, after a while:
"If you desire it."

anguish pierced icr heart as the words escaped her.
But she was determined to keep her promise, aye, as
bravely as ever martyr walked to death.
"Come then, dry up those naughty tears. They make
your beautiful eyes red, and their fringed lids swollen,"
and he playfully kissed her pale brow. Then as if anx-
ious to change the subject, which he fancied gave her use-
less pain, he asked:
"What are you going to do with your flowers?"
"I was just giving William parting directions about
them. I think of taking my birds and dogs with me."
"Why, Maud, who ever' heard of such a thing?" and
he laughed long and heartily. Maud looked surprised,
and perhaps a little offended, at the thought of his treat~
ing her pets with such disrespect, and said timidly:
"That is, if you do not object."
"No, dear, assuredly not. Besides, who knows' but
the poor things need a change of air ;" and as they passed
into the sitting-room he laughed still more heartily as he
bethought himself of the absurd figure he would pre%
sent, travelling with a bevy of birds, and a troop of
pet dogs. Maud felt happier that evening than she
had for a length of time, but her happiness was destined
to be of short duration; even as brief as a ray of sun-
light piercing the storm-cloud. Why did not her hue-
band unbend oftener, and make a companion of her?

food and nourishment to unhealthy sources, when it is do.
nied them by thei~' proper provider.
A stream of light poured invitingly from the library4
and entering this favorite room, Colonel iiartridge settled
himself to his papers, while iMlaud resumed ,~ book she
had been reading. Her eyes rested upon the open page,
but the leaves were not turned, and while sitting in this
mood, and looking at her husband, she thought ~" How
happy we might be!"
Oh, that word "might!" It is the death knell of so
many fond hopes-the last clod upon the grave wherein
are buried, one by one, the joys of life!
A week later Colonel llartridge and Maud were the
guests of Mr. and Mrs. Marlowe. A careless observer
would have said that both place and people were un~
changed; but iNland Jlartridge, who thoroughly compare~
headed the situation of affairs in the household of her
host, noted full well the harder lines that had crept
around Mrs. Marlowe's lips, and that ~he wrinkles had
deepened on her forehead. She was a trifle more sallow,
and a trifle thinner, while her restless eyes and uneaq
manner betokened something wrong within. Strange'to.
say, she conducted herself toward Maud more like &amp;
fawning inferior than the stern superior of other days.
"My dear Maud!" seemed forever on her lips, an epi~
thet to which they were not tutored when the, young
orphan girl hungered for a word of kindness, 'a b~re
breath of affection..
Marlowe was the same whited sepulchre;" pQlished,~
without, as ashen as Dead-sea fruit at heart, and disgust.
ingly obsequious.

He found many topics for discussion with Colonel
Uartridgc, as inca always do, and their former disagree-
meat seemed entirely forgotten. When business, politics,
or current every-day events are the topic of the hour,
men, though they be at enmity, may pass the time as
si noothly as thbse who are friends. This is not usually
the case with women: they are perhaps not more honest
l)ut less politic then men, and where there is dislike, there
is very little chance for the exercise of the genial ameni-
ties of life bet~veen them. Women are commonly indif-
ferent diplomatists. They rarely teach themselves to
control the real state of their feelings; and their inter..
course, if the entente cordiale does not obtain, is naturally
constrained and uncomfortable.
Mrs. Marlowe and her orphan charge had no sympathy
of feeling, and Maud, thinking it was rather late to begin
the cultivation of such sentiments, absented herself, as
much as courtesy would permit from the family circle.
~he had been a day and a night in the house, but had
spemit only a few hours in the society of her hostess.
Colonel llartridge kindly entered a protest ag~im~st such
conduct on the pert of his wife, but it was of no avail.
Within her chamber she sat, looking sadly out of the
window at the village that lay stretched before her.
Memory was busy and carried her back to that cruel day
when her father was snatched front her; and yet a little
farther back and the brokemi shaft of her iriother's tomb
rose up before her, and burying her face in her hands,
she strove to shut out the past with its many reminis-
cences, and cried in the bitternessof her bleeding heart:
"Ohm God! why were these things so?'~
~he indulged those unhappy reflections, however, bat

~or a momeflt,-then brushing away the great tears that
rose up in her eyes, and dimmed her sight, she gazed as
before through the window.
Everything in the panorama was the same as of old,
but they were endeared by no youthful associThon, and
not a single object brougilit the least joy to her heart.
,~ Persons generally revisit the scenes of their childhood
with pleasure; l)ut they are those xvho have there been
tenderly cherished, and whose early years were not disci-
plined in the school of adversity. There were the same
walks which her feet had pressed so often and so wearily,
as she bent her steps to the college within whose walls
she was a comparative stranger; for her timid and sensi~
tive natur~aehd her aloof from the conventional intima-
cies of schoolmates.
Piercing its slender shaft through the trees was to be
seen the spire of the village church, at whose altar she
had learned that the lips may falsely utter those words
which find no response in the heart. There were th~
same tasteful flower-gardens, either brightening the hum~
ble cottage, or lending an additional charm to the abode
of the wealthy. Occasionally, a carriage would drive
slowly by, and in its occupants she would recognize some
familiar faces. She could not call them friends, and
there wa~ no desire in her heart for association with them,
so she sat quietly in the embrasure of the window, oh-
servino' without b observed, and lon~
beino' o             sing for the hour
of their departure. Did the rejected friend of her youth
and loneliness claim no share in her thouo'hts? At
length the door opened and as her husband entered he
sai(l:
"~[aud, gct ready; we leave in an hour."


68            ~UO~1ESTY THE BEST rOLICY.~~                                           ~II0NESTY TH]~ BEST POLICY."

t -

"Thank Heaven!" she cried, with much earnestness,
and commenced preparations for departure at once.
"I am going out with Mr. Marlowe, but will return ix~
time" he said to her, as he left the room.
"Do be quickie please," she pleaded, "or we may b~
left," as she pressed hastily the spring of her watch.
But he tarried, and smiled anxiously as he noted the
state of her mind.
"One might suppose, Maud, from what you say, this
was a haunted house, or the abode of fiends."
"If it were either one or the other I could not be
more wretched than I am here."
And she evidently meant what she said.
"Well, we shall soon be gone," he murmured, leaving
the room.
"God speed the hour!', she replied, busily replacing
some effects in her trunk. Then putting on her hat, she
joined ~ Marlc~we.
They had been conversing only a few moments on in-
different topics, when, much to her relief, the gentlemen
returned.
Etiquette demanded, and Colonel llartridge extendedd
an invitation to his host and hostess to return their visit,
which Maud failed to second with l~er approval, and in
her heart prayed they might think proper not to accept.
Good-byes were hastily and coldly exchanged, and Maud
was wicked enough not to care if the parting was for all
time.
From the first moment pf their arrival, in the village
an undefined apprehension had seized upon her, and she
felt a -secret dread lest some new trouble awaited her.
She had not spoken of it, but the spectre stood befo'~a

~1t

her and would not "down at her bidding." So far nothing
had occurred to justify her suspicions, and remembering
that the train would shortly bear them away, she drew a
sigh of relief. When they arrived in sight of the rail.
road station they noticed a small group of men gathered
around some one, and Maud's heart beat fearfully fast,
when, stepping upon the platform, these wo~ds fell upon
her ears:
"I heard she was here, and, by Heaven, I'll see her, or
die! I'll tell her to her face how she deceived me!"
A desperate scuffle ensued, and the same voice was
heard saying:
"Let me go! L&amp;~t me go "-then with a fearful oath,
added, "or somebody will b~ hurt!"
With superhuman strength the speaker wrested him-
self from the men who held him, and the next instant the
report of a pistol-shot sent terror through the hearts of
the bystanders; fortunately it was discharged in the air
or some innocent life might have paid the forfeit of
such rashness. Several gentlemen now rushed forward,
and while one seized the weapon, two others held th~ un-
fortunate man. Ills fury having expended itself, he ab
lowed his friend to lead him away, without offering re~
distance. Sorrow now took the place of anger, and
scarcely an eye was dry when they saw this strong hut
deluded man moved to tears. This scene, in one of
life's many tragedies, was enacted in a few minutes; -but
what years of agony are sometimes compressed into the
shortest space of time. True oiie lives not by th~ eold~
calendar of days, but by their own deeds.
Maud did not scream or faint, but stood as if riveted
to the spot. Colonel llartridge seemed powerless, ~


70          ~HONE5TY TUE BEST POLTOY.~~
to act, nor did lie stir from the spot until the scene wa~
over.
Then, as if suddenly recollecting himself, he hurried
.Maud into the ladies' saloon.
happily for her the crowd were so intent upon watch-
ing the movements of this rude disturbed she had been
unobserved. No word escaped her lips, but by her quiv-
ering frame it was evident how intensely she suffered.
l3eneath her drawn veil her tears flowed silently, while
Colonel hlartridge walked the floor in a mood of excite-
ment altogether unusual with him; and both were impa-
tient to be gone.
A few minutes passed thus, when the arrival of the ex-
pected train aroused them to immediate action. Step-
ping to the door of the saloon, the Colonel discovered, to
his joy, that the crowd had dispersed with the object of
this unfortunate occurrence. Hastily gathering up his
effects, he said tenderly:
"Come, Maud, we will go now."
Only too glad to quit a place that was fraught with
such harrowing memories, Maud followed quickly, but with
a sad tremor, the footsteps of her husband. As the train
bore them swiftly away a fervent prayer arose from her
heart, and that prayer, could it have found vent in more
titan a soul-surdiarging aspiration, would have been in the
following words:
"Oh, that I may be leaving this unfortunate locality
forever."
It is not difficult to recogilizo George Stanley in the
author of this unhappy scene.
Colonel llartridge and Maud sought a seat far apart*
from the rest of the passengers; the one silent, and the

other endeavoring to bury her feelings beneath a thick
veil which covered her face. She had seen George Stan-
ley but for a single moiient, but that moment had
branded his iffiage on her memory for all time. It mat-
tered not that her eyes were closed and a 'handkerchief
pressed to them; the wreck of her boyish lover stood be-
fore her, and cried for revenge. I~Iis clothes were soiled;
his face haggard and flushed; his beard unkempt, and hi~
hair hanging in tangled luxuriance over his broad shoul-
dci's.
"Oh, heaven! what a falling off was there."
A victim to a blind infatuation, the disappointment
which it brought had made him the slave of a vile habit;
had blasted all the bright prospects of his youth; had
driven his mother into an untimely grave~, and blighted
all the budding hopes of an only and loving sister.
Oh, woman! thou who shouldst save and not destroy-
I thou who shouldst make virtue beautiful ~nd point the
way to heaven, think on the ruin thy trifling may bring,
and pause before permitting the bye of admiration to
become the ruling passion of life.
Maud might have been called the innocent cause of
George Stanley's ruin, but the excuse seems flimsy, by
the way of pretext, when rightly considered, for ~voinauI~
candor might have saved him, and spared her the bitter
pai~gs of an accusing conscience. ( Even granting her

cries out, "Give! give !" her grasping heart hungering
f~r flattery from every man. And if her sinfulness
ended with the attainment of her object, there might be
some hope; but feeding only stimulates such hunger, and
gratification assumes the strange form of disappointment.
This may seem paradoxical, but the inner-life of almost
any-strictly speaking-woman of the world would verify
the possibility of the paradox.
Such a woman has no moral sense-no high4oned prin-
ciple; her whole life is an acting falsehood; she is hcr~

never make a true wife, for the love of a ~ing1e honest

She cannot fill a mother's holy place, for the chief source
of parental respect, confidence, is nullified, and the
corner-stone of their education, truth, is put to the
blush. The deadliest draught is not more poisonous to
the stomach than to society and the family is the daily,
heartless life of the avowed coquette. What though she
may not reel upon the streets and carouse in dens of
iniquity? There should, perhaps, be less excuse for her
conduct than for the unfortunate profligate, for she acts
with premeditation. On the other hand, the inebriate

the world knows cornparati vely little. Their names ar~
recorded only in the Book kept Above; but their wounds
heal not without leaving deep scars, and yet, like Portia,
they endure and suffer in silence, because the world to
woman is so cruel. Yet'the poison is not the less deadly,
or the less maddening because borne in secret, and it will
bias her life for good or evil; it will tend to harden or
soften; it will lead her through tribulation to the Ever-
flowing Fountain, there to drink of Living waters and be
healed, or drive her to recklessness or revenge. If to the
latter, may God have mercy upon her soul!
Is not honesty, then, the best policy?
Colonel Jfartridge and Maud were at their mountain
home. It had been a dreary fortnight for both of them.
The trees were robed in their greenest verdure, the earth
was carpeted with flowers of the brightest hue, the birds
trilled their merriest roundelays, the sunbeams and the
mbot~beains sent quivering rays into the secret nooks, and'
all nature smiled invitingly, but Maud was still confined
to a darkened chamber and took no note of anything.
* The shock had been too severe for her, and utter nervous
prostration had ensued. Her physician quieted the anx-
ious fears of her h~band by assuring him that she was~
in nodanger.N

Poor old Time! when, remedies fail, and skill is baffled,

what to do, or the turf might be green above many who
are only suffering from "a mind diseased," or "a rooted

"If we could only persuade her to leave that room; if
we could only divert the channel of her thou~lits, she
mght be cured," said the doctor to Colonel Ilartridge
'one day.
"I Lave it!" exclaimed llartridge. "I will persuade
her to let us carry her to "The Point" to-morrow. We
will lunch and spend the day there. We can also carry
a lounge, so she can rest when fatigued."
his face brightened as lie spoke.
"That done, the result will be all we can desire," an-

TJie day was long to both of theni; the night restless
to Colonel Ilartridge and distressing to Maud, for she
could not sleep. The morrow dawned bright and cloud-
less, and the sick wife yielded indifferently to her bus-
band's wishes. But her manner was so listless that he
hoped for little. however, fortune favored him, and the
unexpected arrival of Guy gave the impetus so inn c~u
needed. lie supported one side of the inipromptu chair

the sweet, refreshing sleep that night, which opiates had
failed to bring; and from that 'date Mand steadily mi

To a close observer Maud's face was very sad at times,

her sleep she would start and cry, as if pursued by some

By consent, their late visit was never referred to, but
the memory of it lingered in their hearts, and refused to
be banished. Aye, more. The raven folded its sable

'16              COUNTRY A~1D CITY.
All nature gives praise unto Iiim~ who sits upon tim
throne of the most high, but man, who is made in the
image of his God, and who is only a little lower than the
angels, clings to this sin-stained earth, and the clesii'e of
his heai~t seems to be to put eternity between his Maker
and himself. The contemplation of nature awakens a
reverence, a solemnity, and an awe, that is never aroused
by the works~ of man; and Moltaire, scoffer though he was,
might have been a better and a purer man if he had
- studied cities less and the country more.
Men are but copyists at best, but if they would study
closely the models fresh from the Almighty's hand, they
might bring forth better works, and exalt themselves in
so doing. Take Voltaire for example! ta man who was
at one time the idol of France, the shining star of the
age in which lie lived, the brilliant genius upon whom all
Europe gazed, and see how perverted men will become,
who ~vaiider away from The only true and living God, in
search of new theories and strange dogmas. Born in a
corrupt age, his effort seemed to have b~en to leave it
more corrupt than lie found it. T6 him, religion was a
moekery,-friendship, a name,-Aove, a myth-virtue,
unknown - truth, a liai'- heaven, Utopia - and God,
21 ~xm -mon. If he had locked these depraved sentiments
in his own heart, and thrown the key into the bottomless
pit, to the keeping of the demons who had aroused them,
then. his crime might have been tortured into virtue.
Btrt instead of this, his life and genius were devoted to
the dissemination of his views among men. Almost. ~iiy
religion is better than none, for there are few forms of
worship that do not tend to improve their devotees.
Even the heathen, when bowing down to the idol which

his own hands have created, but yields obedience to the
instinct which dwells in his heart, and forces him to ~
knowledge a superior power. If infidels and ath6ist~
would take the trouble to look into the motives which
urge upon these deluded creatures this form of worship,
they might find something in their lives, strange as it
~may sbem, worthy of imitation. Every one, no matter
how insignificant, has some influence, and that power
should be exerted for good, instead of evil. If the pun~
isinnent is in accordance with the talents entrusted; woe
unto those who, by their genius, attract the attention of
men but to instruct them adversely to the divine doe~
trines of Christ. If such persons would leave th~.
crowded cities, where corruption seethes and boiLs; ~
they would flee to the mountains, and, like them, lift
themselves up to the heavens; if then they would pray
for light, the sun of God's righteousness would hasten to
come and flood their hearts with noon-day splendor.
Earnest pleadings might then change places with impious
tcachiugs,-and the world grow better instead of worse.
Maud thought it was glorious to be in the mountains,
and enjoyed there a feeling of freedom and liberty, which
she had never known within the narrow limits of town
or city.
She had viewed the mountain in every aspect, now
bathed in the most glorious sunshine, then enshrouded in
mist, and had watched the storm-king when abroad with
his legions of destruction, hurling rocks violently down to
unfathotned abysses, while the trees were uprooted with
the wind, and splintered ~by the l~ghtningandyer1had~
known no feeling of fear. At eiicli times there was~ t~

grandeur in nature that filled her with awe, ~nd frequently
she would remain upon some cliff, gazing at the clouds
as they grew blacker, and listening to the massing of
heaven's artillery, until the big drops would patter down
and she would be drenched before reaching the houses A
great dreamer, at other times she would sit for hours on
"Point Lookout," and study the clouds as they floated laz-
ily up from the silvery Tennessee, until, rising higher and
higher, they would eilvelop her in their fleecy robes, and
then fade away into the blue ether above, and be lost to
~sight. Or she would sit hour after hour by the. side of
the lakes, and amuse herseTh casting in little pebbles, and
watching the circles, which were so small at first, widen
and widen, untjl they reached the bank. how closely
those little wavelets resemble human lives, which become
more and more extended, until checked at last by the nar-
row bed in whh~h all must repose. Maud became deeply
attached to their ~iinple home in the mountains, and it was
only after much persuasion that her husband prevailed
upon her to appoint a day for her return to the city. lie had
been a bird of passage all summer, coming and going, as his
business required, and the fact of being alone so much, with
absolutely nothing to occupy her time, had only served to
heighten the ideal state in which she lived. Now that
the "melancholy days had come," she was basking in the
glorious beauties of the season, and disliked especially to
abandon them for the contracted, limits of the city. The
grand forests had donned their autumnal robes of red and
gold and russet brown, and her chief occupation then con-
~msted in making wreaths and crosses of the richly tinted

Kate and Daisy had now 1een home for some weeks,
and Maivl( was almost liap:'y w'~ ~li such cheerful and conge~
nial companions. Acquaintance ripened rapidly into
friendship, ~nd their' ages and tastes being similar, their
pi~rsuits, naturally enough, became the same. They were
both a!nateurs in music, and together, with Maud and
(4i'i y, formed a merry as well as a musical quartette; and
4~e bou~e of the ilartridges, from being the most quiet
~ne in town, became the abode of gayety. Maud revelled
iii the excitement of the hour, and was, strange to say,
K
glad of anything that left' her no time to herself. Cob
6nel Hartridge was, if possible, more overwhelmed in
business than ever, and unfortunately made his office hi~
home. However, he silently acquiesced in what gave
Maud and the girls pleasure, or if he did not no one xvas
any the wiser, for he kept his own counsels. Kate flyrd
was the only child of his' most intimate friends, who had
both died suddenly of yellow fever some years previous,
leaving her and her fortune in his hands. Daisy Dean
was the 'niece of his first wife, and his adopted daughter,
having been left motherless at an early age. Was it not
strange that those two girls and Maud should, by the~cir4
Cuitous path of fortune, have been thus thrown together

in the same household? How dearly they all learned to
love one another, and how closely their very heartstrings
became entwined, will be known hereafter. Rate was
the very imp of mischief, committing the most outrageous
acts, of which no one thought anything, as they laughingly
said, "It's only Kate Byrd."~ She was very pretty, with-
out being beautiful, and in her pale blue eyes lurked a
spice of merriment which was quite provocative. With
soft, light brown hair, she had a complexion which was
clear but tale, and was tall and slender, and grace itself. To
these beauties of person were added the generosity of as
warm and good a heart as ever beat within human breast,
and by her witty and sparkling manners she startled,
rather than won admiration.
T1~ere was but one opinion in regard to IDaisy, and that
was that she was beautiful. She was a perfect blonde,
with deep blue eyes, golden hair, snowy complexion,
dimpled cheeks, ruby lips and pearly teeth. Add to this
loveliness the most winning ways, and the problem by,,.
which she bewitched all hearts will be readily solved.
"The immaculate trio," as Guy called them, were grouped
artistically one morning in the sitting-room, discussing a
ball that was to be given that night at Miss Ware's.
"Yes, we are all goino~" said Kate in response to an
inquiry on the subject.
"Then I will make some bouquets," said Mana, 82nd
stepping into the conservatory, clipped a basket of e~otiics
for the purpose. Daisy had thrown herself gracefully ~i
upon a lounge, and was loQking through ~the "last Demo~ ~
rest," for the latest fashions. Her dress, of blue and-
white plaid, was very b~comino' and 'her exquisite coin.

her head like a crown of gold. Kate sat rocking slowly
back and forth, reading what she called a note, but what
certainly verged on a letter. A smile played in thc
corners of her mouth, and her eyes beamed with happi.
ness, as she looked up.
" Well! what does he say, Kate ~" asked Daisy, with a
liberty which was admissible, considering the intimacy
which existed between them.
"Oh, it's nothing but an invitation from harry to
attend the ball to-night," and her face criinsoned with
blushes.
"And how many pages does it require for so small a
request," persisted Daisy, with mock innocence.
"As many as you like," was the curt reply; and Kate,
evidently teased, left the room to send a reply.
Her dress of green and blue plaid displayed her com~
plexion and figure to fine advantage, for she never looked
better than on that particular morning. Maud wore a
breakfast robe of pearl-colored cashmere with facings of
crimson silk, and, if possible, it heightened a beauty
~hieh required no assistance from art.
The canaries warbled sweetly, the delicate rose-colorc~1
ceiling shed a warm halo over everything; new books,
ipagazines, and papers were tossed in l)retty confusion
on the tables; choice pictures and rare statuettes adorned
the walls, the air 'was laden with the perfume of orange
blossoms, that came wafted in from the open window of
the conservatory, and, in its tropical softness and warmth,
the picture would have done credit to an artist's con-
ception.

TIlE BALL AT MISS WARE~5.
* OLONEL IIARTRIDGE was late returning
home that evening, so it was quite eleven when
he and his beautiful young wife, together with
the b and their escorts arrived at Miss Ware's.
The home~'of the Wares was one of those old "Tabby
Houses," to be seen now and then in this "ghoul-haunted
woodland of Weir," which stand boldly out like some
grand antig~t~, and whisper silently of gentle blood and
spotless history. Entering the brilliantly illuminated
honse to strains of enchanting mu sic, the party in
question hurriedly paid their respects to their host and
lioste~s, and repaired at once to the dancing saloon. here,
their tablets were soon filled, and they abandoned them~
selves to the gayety of the hour. As Colonel llartridge
did no~ dance, he sought the card-room, and was soon
deeply interested in a game of whist. Maud looked
superb that evening, for she was dressed most becomingly
in a rose-colored moire-antique made em train, with
g)c6nier of joint c4ppiiqud, while diamonds glittered upon
her neck, arms, and corsage, and a tiny diamond bird;
which held a pink moss-bud in its mouth, sparkled in the
puffs which arose as a coronet upon her classic head. She
was quite a favorite in society; and her beauty elicited
bursts of admiration wherever she turned; but her digni
lied manner kept every one at a proper distance, and h0
would have beemi bold who had dared couch his praise i~
any but the most respectful terms.

"You are looking perfectly radiant to-night, Kate,"
said harry Fielder, as she sank upon an ottoman to rest.
just as they finished a spirited gcd op.
"Don't I always look so?" asked this imp of mis-
Chief. -
"Of course you do, my darling," he answered, while ho
gazed upon her with a look of intense admiration.
"Don't be so affectionate, harry. People might sup-
pose we were in love;" and. a becoming pout was visible
upon her thin, ruby lips.
"I hope they would think correctly?" was the rather
doubtful reply, as harry looked searchingly into her
saucy blue eyes.
"Not a bit of it," laughed this coquette, as she went
off with some gentleman, who just then reminded her
that the last half of that ~r&amp;dop belonged to him. harry
~stood looking after this capricious creature, with a troubled
expression upon his manly face, while there was ~ miug~
Rug of, love and pain' in his heart.
Her dress, which was exceedingly becoming, was a
happy combination of the simple and beautiful, consisting
as it did of white tarlatan, elaborately puffed, the puffs
being divided by blue satin piping. The panier and
corsage were trimmed correspondingly, while sprays of
silver #heat, caught by silver bees, sparkled in her browr.
hair, and silver jewelry, and a blue Roman sash, completed
this exquisite toilette.
While Kate was trying her charms upon her new
partner in a retired corner of the saloon, Fred West was
saying, "What. a lovely 'Undine' you would make to~
night, IDaisy!"
"My dress is appropriate; do you like it, Fred?"

"I think I never saw a more exquisite toilette," and he
gazed at her with his whole soul beaming in his eyes.
The conversation was inieri'upted by a Mr. llunter,~wlio
said:
"I was just in search of you, Miss Dean-I believe this
is our waltz," and leading her off, ti~iey were soon whir1~
lug in that delicious dance, to the music of the "ililda
ViTaltzes."
As she floated around the room, her light and airy
dress attracted niuich attention. It was composed of tarlm.
* tan, in the new shade of IMletternich, made with myriads
of narrow frills, while the overskirt and corsage were ('f
crystal tarlatan, producing the effect of dew-drops on green
gossamer. ITer golden hair was cr4pecl and fl~wiug,
while a little crystal bird peeped out hereand there, hold.
ing sprays of sea-weed and grasses in their months. She
wore no jewelry, for her good sense told her that youth
and beauty required no embellishment.
The two hours before supper flew by on rosy wings,
and Maud could scarcely realize it was past one, when the
Colonel came to escort her to the table. Tie was unnsu~
ally silent, and fancying a cloud rested upon his brow,
Maud said:
"lYhat is the' matter?"

of others. By this time they had reached the supper
room, and the conversation was broken, not to be renewed.
Sitting in the embrasure of a window, looking around,
she thought her eyes had never listed upon a more
brilliant assemblage. The women were incomparable,
the men gallant and distingu~, the nmsic entrancing, and
the feast all that the most fastidious epicure could have
asked. Wit and repartee flashed around the board, and
many were the toasts that were pledged in the exhila-
ratii)g 1~oderer; but neither the dainty dishes, nor choice
yiands, tempted Maud, and her manner was abstracted,
as she gave only random answers to the questions of two
or three gentlemen who were standing around her. Tired
of the crush incident to a crowded supper-room, she was
only too glad to join the ladies, who were then leaving
the gentlemen to their xvine and cigars. having been
denied the pleasure of a conversation with Miss Ware,
eaily in the evening, she sought that opportunity but to be
disappointed, for the young hostess was engaged else-
where. Left to her own resources, she entered the
music-room, thinking to while away the few intervening
rnomOIit3 in trying the " Steinxvay Gi'and" that there
reigned supreme monarch.
Absorbed in her own tlu~ughts, she did not obsei#e a
gentleman who stood across the room by a table slowb
turning the leaves of some sheet music.
Seating herself at the instrument, her fingers glided
almost unperceptibly into that most touching of all airs,
"Ah, che, lc&amp; morte."
The arrangement was her own, and so intensely did
she enter into the spirit of the composition that, for the
time being, all other thoughts were ignored. Suddenly

she became aware of the presence of some one, and look~.
ing rip, encountered the burning gaze of a stranger. ITo
had glided noiselessly to the piano, and was regarding
her with an intensity which must have proceeded from
an appreciation of her music. In blushing confusion she
arose hastily, and was just leaving the instrument, when
Miss Ware joined her and said, "Mi's. Ilartridge, allow
me to present Mr. D'Estaing; I am sure you will be the
I)C5t of friends, since one is such a brilliant performer,
and the other, such a connoisseur in music."
"Oh, Miss Ware, I must enter a protest against such
flattery," IMland smiled and said.
"As T must al~so, but with thanks to Miss Ware for her
kindness."
his voice~ was low and musical, and his accent slightly
foreign. As their hostess then bowed and left them, the
stranger said,
"I trust you will pardon me, madam, for the liberty I
took in listening to your music."
"Oh, certainly. I am only too glad, if. you found it
worthy your attention."
"It has been an age since I have heard any one play
with so much soul and expression; "Ak, eke, Ia morte"
is my favorite air, although the emotions it awakens
might be justly called painful yleasures."
Without noticing his allusion, Maud said,
"I think Verdi's name should be enrolled among the
saints for that air alone. But do you not play, Mr.
D'Estaing?"
"Not now," he said, with a sigh.
"You have?"

"Au, Maud, I was in search of you," said Colonel
Ilartridge, joining her. "If you are ready, we xviii go."
"Mr. D'Estaing, Colonel llartridge," said Maud, pre~
sentin g the two gentlemen. As they grasped each other's
hands, in genuine Southern style, the Colonel said,
"I am happy to meet you."
"I am equally delighted, and more especially as I am
the bearer of some messages to you from your friend,
IMI~reau.
"Indeed? Where did you know him?" asked the
Colonel with pleasure.
"In the East."
"I should as soon have expected news from the dead,
for he never writes now," said the Colonel with regret.

"I am glad to welcome you to our city, and shall do

The conversation was here interrupted byiMaud, who

~o'very 'of it trikess the mind with an inward joy, and

and wonien. are vanquished by its powers, and if their lips
refuse to speak its praise, their hearts acknowledge, in
sec:~et, that "a thing of beauty is a joy forever."
Alphonse D'Estaing would have boon considered a
noble specimen of his race, in any age and among any
people, and it is but just to add that he had been the
object of much silent admiration wherever his roving
footsteps had led him. Among his friends lie was often
spoken of as that "perfect specimen of nfaiily beauty,"
and here, amid strangers, his "unfortunate appearance,"
as he considered it, made him conspicuous where he had
hoped to remain unnoticed. His whole air was so striking
that if an author had been in want of a hero, D'Estaing
would have been chosen at once as the man to fill the
place. lie had the sad, dreamy eyes, the melancholy cast
of features, tl~e ~manly proportions,~ and the mysterious
something, which writers fancy, and which fascinate the
reader. Beauty is a dangerous gift to both men and
women, and if IYEstaing had not abused his personal
charms in order to gain unenviable triumphs, it might have
been attributed to the fact that his life was absorbed by
some fatal remembrance, and not that he was freer from
tern ptation than othei's.
The morning after the ball, he sat in his "sanctum,"
buried in reflection. Lightly, but surely, fell the foot of
time, and the world went on the same, but ho was evi~

gently oblivious, if not indifferent, to both. His hat was
drawn over his eyes, wreaths of cigar smoke encircled his
head, and leaning back in a chair, his feet rested upoii a
table of papers, books, and magazines which sat near. A
review of those books, etc., as well as an editorial, were to
be forthcoming by a stated hour, but up to the present
moment his d aties had claimed no part of his attention.
lie was conscious of only one thing, and that was a dis-
tracting memory of the music he had heard the evening
before. The touch was so like nEns-his beautiful, inno-
cent dead. Yes, there was sornetjiing about her that re~
called poor Marie. It was not a resemblance-no-it was
a certain tone of voice, a softness of maimer-a pair of
dreamy brown eyes, full of pleading tenderness. No, they
had no features ali ~ce, and yet-and yet, there was some-
thing similar, ~nd that something was very bewildering.
lie vainly thought the " dead past had buried its dead,"
and did not dream it possible that a strain of music could
so vividly recall the images of the "loved and lost."
Then, to' his horror, the "Misei'cre" sounded painfully
in his ears, like a funeral dirge that was being chanted by
mocking demons, his murdered playmates passed before
him, and in another moment their voices seemed to join.
in their O~vu requiem. The tones were the same in
which Gustave sang during those last happy (1~yS ~n
Paris as "Manrico," with Marie as "Leonora," and the
friends who happened to be present rendering the chorus.
'Was lie holding communion with the (lead, or had the.
dead conic back from the grave to mock him? Was it
reality~was it fancy? Was lie waking-was he sleep-
ing? Who knows, as I~aphiaeI von Ezra says, in "Ilypa-
tia," but what dreams are realities, and sleeping waking?


92              ALPHONSE D~ESTAINO.
Thu~ hour after hour, D'Estaing sat brooding over that
pa~t 'whieh he firmly believed nothing but resurrection
b
day could disentomb, until memory was maddened-brain
was frenzied-heart was on lire, and life became almost
msnpp~ tablel.
Whence this strange man came, or what were his ante-
cedents ~no one knew, but his courtliness of manner evi-
dently stamped him as one born in the purple. his ac~
quaintanee with Mr. Ware, which had been secured
through the publicatIon of some able articles on "IRepub-
licanism in Europe," ~as fortunate, for it had been the
means of introchwiTlg him to a small literary coteriewliere
he was duly appreciated. It was difficult to gain an
enfrie into this circle, and Mr. Ware rather hesitated
about presenting him; but the fact of his being an entire
stranger was soon forgotten in an increased and apprecia-
tive popularity. This was perhaps owing as much to his
modesty and want of assumption, as to his polished manners
and cultivation. Preferring to be left alone, he sought no
one, but when an advance was made to liimit was met
wjth consideration and politeness. lie was nol a cynic,
for he was not embittered; nor yqt a misanthrope, for he
hftd found it impossible to live without the society of
friends.
His melancholy was of that s~ubdned kind, which shows
that the heart has been softened by whatever sorrow it
may have known. And his air, although tinged with
kauteur, waS proverbially amiable. his eyes and hair
w~ere jet black; his brow high and intellectual, his nose
~lightly l~oman, while a very dark complexion bespoke
the foreign blood which flowed in his veins. His mus~
tache and imperial, which had been the envy of princes,

did not conceal the peerless lips and faultless teeth
beneath, 1)uit rather revealed them in greater beauty.' lie
had attained the perfection of height, and his proportion~
were in accordance. lie looked and walked like a king~
and although iris young life seemed bowed down by some
"weight of woe," when looking into his penetrating eyes,
one felt sure that there was nothing concealed which
would tarnish his honor if revealed.
This ~)rOlOflgOd reveri~ was terminated abruptly by a
rap at the door, and as 1~ir. D'Estaing awakened slowly
from his day-dreams, he~ sprang to his feet, and said,
"Come in," before lie actually knew what had aroused
him, or to whom he spoke. Ills visitor stood in 'the door-
way, but was evidently undecided whieth~r to enter or not.
"Your pardon, Colonel lIartridge," D'Es.taing ~ow
said, and, advancing quickly, grasped him by the hand.
"Iwas indulging a fanciful mood, and was so lost in
thought that I did not know who asked admittance. I
am delighted, to see you."
"Thanks, but you see I am not very punctual, as I
was to be here at eleven, and it is now one."
"One o'clock!" exclaimed D'Estaing in surprise. "It
cannot be possible. here have I been sitting dreaming
the whole morning, with all my duties neglected. I fear
I shall make but a poor editor."
"It must be a very hum-drum kind of life, that is, I
mean to say that the same daily routine must become
very tedious."
"On the contrary, I find it really fascinating. But
then I suppose any employment would seem better than
none to a man who has been for years a wanderer, with
nothing particularly to do."


114             ALPHONSE D'ESTAING.
"Oh, yes, I presume so. I hope I find you well aftei
th~ dissipation of last evening?"
L~Not so, I regret t#y. I am so unaccustomed to late
hours and parties, t4at I arose fronri a troubled sleep this
morning with such ~ severe headache, that it has totally
unfitted me for my duties. I was just trying a cigar,
which is my panacea for every ill. Do let me offer you
one.
"Thanks. I, too, find them, as Buiwer says, 'a solace in
every sorrow, an amendment to every joy, a panacea for
every woe."'
"Parties are such a bore to me that I am half-vexed
with myself for attending this one. However, Mr. Ware
has been so kind to me since my arrival here, that I could
not well decline hi~ invitation."
"Then you knew tile 'Wares before?"
"Never! My pen was my first and only introduction tQ
Mr. Ware."
"For my own sake, I am very glad you attended .the
party, or I mio'ht never have known you.
Colonel Ilartridge was not a demonstrative i~ian, as has
alrea(ly been shown but he felt iustiuctiv~ly drawn
toward the young stranger, and, singularly enough for
him, yielded to the blind intuition., It was rather a re-
markable coincidence that D'Estaing should entertain the
same feeling for his kind visitor, for if they had any sen~
timents in unison they were as yet undeveloped.
* "You are very kind, I am sure, and I must thank you.
In speaking of this ~)arty, I only intended to refer to my
d~sl~ke for general society. I infinitely prefer a social
hour with a friend to all the balls and parties."
* "We agree exactly ofl this point, but, as my wife is fond

AL~HON8E D'ESTAING
of such gayeties, I try to cultivate a taste for them foe
her sake. But you have told me nothing of my old
friend Morean."
Well, there is little to tell, for although we were.
travelling companions for nearly two years we exchanged
110 coiifid~iic~s.
"Is it possible?"
"At one time we wandered on the classic shores of
Greece too~ether, at another time we traversed the burn-
ing deserts of Arabia, and on one occasion stood side by
side upon the Pyramids; but at all seasons, and in all
places, he wore the same haggard, wretched look. It
seemed as if life was over for hhn, but he never breathed
a word to me, nor I to him."
"Poor fellow! to think he has allowed the faithlessnesrs
of a frivolous woman to blast his xvliole. life-simpleton
that he is."
"But his nature is so intense, that he feels deeply and
for a long time."
"Perh4s so, and as time cures all things, my only hope
110W 15 that his poundss may be healed in years to come."
"But time does not cure all thimigs; would to God it
did," caine from tile lips of D'Estaii~g~ with so much
earnestness as to make his visitor suspect that he, too, had
apa8t.
"lIe has written me that he is frequently without a
dollar, and that he is sleeping upon the ground, while his
fortune is lying-idly here, and he goes into such inaceessi-
ble places that no money can reach him."
"lIe has become fascinated with the !dfc," said WEs-
taiiio'
"Indeed, we both liked it, and used often to laugh at

our poverty. What brought me back to civilization, 1
know not, for I was better contented in the wild Arabdife
we led than I have been since my arrival here."
C~J am sorry to hear you say so, and I hope when you
have ~ere longer, and know us better, that you will
change your opinion."
The conversation then drifted into a variety of sub-
jects, all of which were ably discussed by the stranger,
and when Colonel llartridge consulted his watch, he
found, to his amazement, that two hours had glided rapidly
by. Arising to go, he said, "I really must beg pardon,
Mr. D'Estaing, for trespassing so long upon your time."
"And I must thank you for a most opportune and
agreeable visit."
"If I thought your aversion to society did not extend
to a quiet family dhiner, I should request the honor of
your company this evening.~~
"I am deeply grateful for your kindness, but it will
be impossible to-day, as I am in arrears with all my
duties. At some future time I shall be most happy to
accept the kind invitation with which y6u. have honored
"To-morrow, then ~"
"Yes, to-morrow, for I am eager to heai~ some of your
wife's delicious music again."
"She says I do not appreciate it," at the same time
smiling proudly at this compliment to his beautiful young
wife.
The two then shook hands warmly, and as they parted,

THE DINNER-PARTY.
CHAPTER XIV".
THE DINNER-PARTY.
"We may live without poetry, music and art;
We may live without conscience, and live without heart;
We may live without friends; we may live without books;
But civilized man cannot live without cooks.
He may live without  , ~what is knowledge but grieving?,
He may live without hope,-w~iat is hope but deceiving?
He may live without love,~w~at is passion but pining?
But where is the man that can live without dining?"
hAT man cannot live without cooks and dining,
may, in the words of Owen Meredith, be very
true, but it is neither the one nor the other that
makes "the hour of dinners the most blessed upon earth;
it is "the feast of reason, the flow of soul," the society of
congenial spirits, th~ brilliance of conversation, which
flavors the wine, renders the patA famous, and consecrates
the odor of certain flowers.
It was neither the viands, nor the delicacies, which
have handed down, through two centuries, those famous
dinners, which used to be given in a certain alley in
Paris, but it was the wit of Scarron,'and the brilliance of
Madame de Maintenon, which have preserved the memory
of them.
When Marc Antony partook of the most extravagant
feast of which the world has any account, it would have
lacked the proper flavor, unless the pearl had been dis~
solved by the "glorious Sorceress of the Kile2' and while
it is admitted that cooks and~dinners, in themselves, may
be necessary to sustain life, it isno less true7 that company. K

ionship and circumstances are the requisites which make
~ "the hour of dinners the most blessed upon earth."
~ut it xvas of neither ancient nor modern, simple nor
extravagant banquets, that D'Estaiug thought, as he said
to himself,
"Ought I to go to this dinner to-day? I have promised,
but I can be released. Is it exactly honorable for me to
accept the hospitality of any one, under the false charac-
ter in wliidi fate compels mc to appear?"
But the music of that evening at the ball tempted him,
with its lingering echoes; as the day advanced no excuse
was sent, and at a little pa3t six he handed Mrs. hart-
ridge in to dinner. There were many elements which
should have made it a "blessed hour," but notwithstand-
ing the combination, there seemed to rest upon one and
all a constraint which would not be dispelled, and to
Maud the meal was interminable. The table was ~pre~id
d Ia Russe, and after expressing his admiration at the
profusion of exotics, which so vividly recalled his child-
hood~s days, the stranger, to the right of the hostess,
lapsed again into a silence, which was only broken by the
deinarwls of courtesy. Colonel Ilartridge ventured a few
remarks, with the hopes of inducing a general con ver-
sation, but they fell stilLborn, and the dead silence which
followed each effort only heightened the quiet embarrass-
ment which they all felt. Maud looked beseechingly at
Guy, who was always so ready and witty; but he was
never easy in the presence of his rival, harry Fielder, and
her plead ing glances failed to produce the desired effect.
Kate seemed under a ban, and Daisy and Fred. talked in
a low whisper, which rather resembled the tone of fear
than of. ~p1aisanteri~. ~ot even the champagne, with it~

* exhilarating effects, had the power to elevate their spirits,
arid as soon as the cc~f6 noir was served, Maud and the
girls eagerly availed themselves of the privilege of retir..
lug, and leaving the gentlemen to their cigars. When
in the pai'lor, Kate said, in her usual impressive st
"Ileavens! If Luerezia I3orgia had
presided at that
dirinei, and forced us to drink her fatal poison, it could
not have been more funereal. What's the matter with all
of us?"
"What's the matter with you?" asked Maui
"I don't know, I'm sure! I feel as if ~bout to be exe~
cuted, and you both look the same. We must be indebted
to the 'mysterious stranger' for such horrid feelings.
Who knows, anyhow, but that lie may have Borgia blood
in his veins?"
"Oh, IKate," said Daisy, as a feeling of terror ran
through her.
Ataud said nothing, but seating herself at the piano,
wandered off into some dreamy air, which reached the
diiiiiig-roorn, and soon brought the "mysterious stranger"
to her side. Pausing to acknowledge his presence, he
said, "Do you know that your music has haunted me ever
since the evening of the ball ?"
"Indeed? that i~ quite a compliment," and~; her face
~~as wreathed with smiles.
"It is true, and I have tried in vain to exerejse the
memory of it."
"To ejeorci8e it?" burst in surprise from her lips.
" Then it gave you pain rather than pleasure?"
"Yes. It was.~ painful pleasure."
A deep sigh followed the words, an expression of
suffering came over his face, and Maud regarded him i~

THE PIN~ERPARTY.

wondering silence. The merry peals of laugT~r which
came from the opposite room at this moment sounded
like mockery, but perhaps were fortunate, as they served
to arouse D'Estain~ from a melancholy mood which was
neither suited to the time nor place. Suddenly rccollect~
ing that he was in the presence of a stranger, he said,
"Do give me some music."
There was no reply, but, as if acting under a spell,
Maud selected a piece which happened to be lying on the
piano, and holding it up, said,
"Shall I ~ this?"
"XVhat is it?"
"Prudent's Miserere."
"No--for heaven's sake, no "-came from his lips with
such earnestness and "wild regret," as made her shudder.
Quickly dropping the piece, as if there had been pollu~
tion in the touch, she looked again at the singular being
before her, but said nothing. After a few moments he
hurried to say,
"I beg pardon, madam, bat there are such bitter mem~
ones associated with that air, that Ii never wish to hear it
again.
There is nothing more embarrassing than a half-conff
deuce, and a painful pause ensued.
Thinking to dispel the momentary gloom which had
seized her guest, and extended to herself, she left the
piano, and calling to Kate, said,
"Come and sing one of your bright songs for Mr.
D'Est~ing. My music is all too sad for liin-i."
Without awaiting to be pressed, Kate did as requested,
and rendered that reckless song, called "The mirth of
despair.~~ It was written by an English officer, ~ho was

stationed in India, and is said to have been sung by the
soldiers, during the terrible ravages of some epidemic
there, which swept them away by hundreds, when every*
man felt that lie might be the next victim. G~iy joined
in ihe chorus, and as they saiig verse after verse, IMlaud
became nervous, and Mr. D'Estaing was horrified to het
a woman's lips sing,
"Here's to the dead already,
Efnrrah for the one who dies next."
At its conclusion a feeling of relief burst from every
heart in the room, and Kate retired, writhing under a si..
lent condemnation, which was felt as keenly as if it had
been expressed. From that night a mutual dislike sprang
up between herself and Mr. D'Esta~iig which amounted to
indifference on his part, and hatred on hers, and time but
increased these sentiments. As Kate and Guy repaired
to the libi.ary, Maud said,
"Come now, Daisy, and sing my favorite for Mr. D'Fs.
tain&amp;'
"With pleasure, if Mr. D'Estaing wishes to hear it,"
she smiled and said.
The gentleman referred to evinced his desire by es~
cortiug her to thQ piano, and she sang, in her mpst be~
witching manner, "'Tis but a little faded flower."
his pleasure was expressed in his face, and when' she
had finished the only two verses it contains, ho begged
that she would sing it again. But as they were calling
her to complete a game of cards in the library, she ex-
cused herself by promising an early repetition, and re~
tired. Maud was watching the stranger with increasing
interest, and she wondered if he "kept dead flowers," 01

"a ring," or "a tress of golden hair." When they were
alone once more, he said, with great emphasis,\
"Will you not give me some music?"
With a mi~cliievous smile she said, "Have you not been
listening to music?"
"Oh, yes," he replied, with a shrug of the shoulders,
which plainly signified " Oh no."
"But with due respect to the ladies, I do not fancy
th~t style."
"Well, what shall I play ? '~ asked Maud with some
hesitation at making a selection.
"Anything you choose. I have no prejudice against
any other air, except your first selection."
Without replying she placed Ilerz's "Andante" upon
the board, and played it with all that dreamy pathos and
depth of feeling which it must ever arouse in the soul of
the appreciative. With bowed head, D'Estaing drank in
every note, and when the last echo had died away, he
looked up only for a moment, to say,
"Play on-play on."
His appreciation inspired INland, and a number of clas-
sical selections followed each other in rapid succession,
until she was forced to cease from physical exhaustion.
The last chord had been played, but the sound of it still
floated on the air; and the listener sat with bowed head,
as the performer arose from the instrument.
Looking up just then, iD'Estaing said, "I cannot find
words, madam, to express to you the exquisite pleasure
your music has afforded me."
"I congratulate myself upon having had such an ap
preciative listener."
I

* "My only reo'ret is that it is over so soon."
.1  ~
"P~~t it is not so soon," said Maud, for she was really
suffering with fatigue.
"Tine-and I must beg pardon for trespassing so long
upon your time."
"1 am never happier than when playing for some one
who loves music as I do."
"You are more than kind, and I must return my
thanks for a charming evening. I promised to join your
husband very soon, when we parted at the table, and I
fear he will think inc a sad delinquent."
"Oh, no; he ~vill only consider his wife's charms
greater than his," said Maud mischievously.
"And he will consider very rightly," added D'Estaing
with fervor.
"Come, we xviii look him up," said Maud, and leading
the way, ID'Estaing folloxved her, and they entered the
sitting-room together, to find the Colonel dozing over a
cheerful fire.
Maud then said "good-night," and not feeling in the
humor to join the gay circle in the library, sought her
own chamber, and wheeling~ an arm-chair before the
grate, sat gazing into the glowing embers, and thinking of
their strange visitor, until her eyelids drooped and she
fell asleep. She slumbered lightly, and in her dreams
came visions of a dark and handsome stranger, a rich,
mellow voice fell softly upon her ear, a pair of poetic
eyes gazed into hers, and the air was filled with seraphic
strains. D'Estaing remained hut a moment with his host,
for he was in no mood for talking, and he desired chiefly
to be alone. But in the solitude of his chamber he waa

in your life, and tell me if you really love
* These words were spoken with deep
feeling by Harry Fielder, several days after the dinner-
party, during which time his patience and devotion had
been sorely tried. * Kate thought she would have a little
fun, and a mischievous smile parted her lips, as she said,
"Well, really, Harry, I don't know whether II do or
not."
"Who does, then?" was the quick retort.
"1 regret II cannot inform you," came provokingly
from a pretty roscbud mouth.
"Perhaps Mr~ Witherell could give me the desired in--
formation, as he seems to be your confidential friend at
present."
"Perhaps he could," was archly said by the fair tor--
mentor.
"Kate, this coquetting has gone far enough. You
know how I worship you, and yet you can find it in your
heart to tantalize me in this cruel manner. You say you

do n~t know whether you love me or not, and that per.
haps another person can give me the desired information,
and that-"
"Why, Harry, I do believe you are jealous," and a
pretty picture she made, sitting there picking a camellia
to pieces, which he had just given her.
"No, I am not jealous, Kate; and yet I would not foi"
the world think I owned a heart which was not wholly
nnne"
"What nonsense you talk, Harry," was the taunting
reply.
"I swear, Kate, you are enough to provoke a saint from
heaven."
"But you must not swear at all, Harry, and especially
in the presence of a lady.~~
harry was provoked beyond description, and all his
efforts at concealment were vain; but his wounded tone of
voice failed to soften the heart of the capricious creature
so fondly loved, as he said, a second time,
"Do ~you love me, Kate, and do you intend to be mar-
ried to me?"
"The first question has been discussed sufficiently, and
the second one will be answered at the altar, when the
priest asks, 'Wilt thou take this man to be thy wedded
husband?'"
"But who is to be the happy man?" eagerly asked
ITarry.
"I haven't the slightest idea," she laughed.
"Oh, Kate, why will you keep me in such cruel sus~
pense."
"Well, indeed I don't know, Harry;" and her merry1
childlike laughter grated harshly on her lover's heart.

"Take care, Kate, for remember there is suclu~thing
~s going too far, and patience may be exhausted."
These words were spoken more iii sorrow than in an-
ger, but misconstruing them purposely, Kate said haugh-
tily,
"Oh, you threaten, do you?"
"No, my darling, but you cannot understand how
deeply I feel your treatment, nor how much pain you
dive me, because you do not love as I do."
"If you read hearts so well, why have you asked the
same question so frequently?"
" Oh, Kate, II do not read hearts,-wou1~d to Heaven I
did, for then I might discover ~what I fear I shall never
learn from your lips."
"And what is that?"
"Why ask, when you know so well? It is whether you
~in~erely and truly love me or not?"
having toyed with her victim until she was tired ,this
imp of contradiction and waywardness threw up her
handkerchief, arid cried,
"A truce-a truce,"-and Harry's        face and
beaming eyes expressed his unuttered thanks. Not know-
in g what to say, or what to expect, he awaited tile pleas-
ure of his fair tormentor, xvho soon said to him, in her
most bewitching and coquettish manner," Do you forgive
me, Harry?"
"Freely and fully, my darling,"-
"Will you listen to what I have to say?".
"With all my heart."
"Well, Ilarry, you know I am nothing but. a madcap
ti'iily, and that I scarcely know my own mind two minutes
at a time. Suppose I were to say now that I love y~u

better than all the world beside, engage myself to you to
be married on a certain day, and the next week or month
brought some one whom I should like better, what then ?"
"1 have never contemplated it in that light, K ate," and
cloud rested upon the face that was so hri~lit a moment
before.
"Well, then, it is high time you had done so, for it is
altogether possible and probable that that xviii be the
very xvay I shall do."
harry made no reply, but a deep sigh expressed what
he felt.
"Come, don't be so downhearted, Harry, for at pres-
ent II like you better than any one else ;-does that fact
give you any pleasure?"
"Indeed it does," was the happy rejoinder of one who
lived between clouds and sunshine.
"And if I promise that at the expiration of a year I
will consummate matters, provided my feelings undergo
110 change, will that satisfy you?"
~
'~ Not so fast, my young man-I said provided. In the
meantime, you. know, I am to spend the summer at Sara-
too'a, and the next winter in New Qrlcans. Do you not
tremble for your fate?"
"Not at all. I w~uld trust you to the ends of the
world, my darling'"
"There shall be no positive engagement, and, remem
her, I will not be annoyed by needless jealousies, or allow
any restraints to 1)e placed upon my actions whatever.

"No-no buts," and a~ she placed her hand over hi~
mouth, he seized and smothered it with kisses.
Snatching it away, she sprang from her seat and said,
Ii declare, harry, I'm 'tired to death, for II never kept
still so long before."
"You do indeed remind me of the promised land-just
in sight, but never possessed,-of Paradise, while I am a
lone wanderer on tside."
"I declare, harry, it is time you were at your office.
How will you ever support me at this rate?"
"Oh, Kate, you are so entirely devoid of all sentiment."
"And yet you say you love me?"
"Yes, darling, better than life itself."
"I would dislike to put you to the test. But do go,
I'm dreadfully tired of you."
"Will you not give me one kiss at parting, Kate?"
"Not unless you know how to storni the citadel and
carry it without asking permission."
iRushing to accept the banter, he was doomed to fresh
disappointment, for making her escape, she laughed mer~
rily, and running up stair~, threw him kisses from the tips
of her pretty lingers.
So, harry, poor fellow, had to leave without a kiss, or
even a pressure of the hand; and notwithstanding this
hoyden provoked and teased him to such an extent, he
was more madly infatuated, with her than ever.

True, it had been a mingling of. roses and thorns
-of bitter and sweet-of pleasure and' pain, and yet the
memory of it was cherished fondly. Maud played with
more fecliug than usual one evening, and the inspiration
which produced such a happy effect was doubtless to be
traced to an appreciative listener who sat near.
D'Dstaiug had now become almost a daily visitor at
the hlartridges's, as well as a constant companion in their

riably lingered a moment in their box, if he did not attend
them.
Their friendship~\as everything to this stranger and

upon art, music, poetry. and the drama. Th~y had visited to~
gather every point of interest around the poetic and dreamy
city, and the beauty of each spot had always been enhance
by his discriminating taste and artistic eye. On the even~

similar thrill of the soul, recalled an hour of long ago,
and, as if impelled by an unseen power, D'Estaing said,
"Without drawing invidious comparisons, you reilly must
go to Italy, the land of song, to hear the old masters ren.

7 sunsets was gilding tower and steeple, spire and dome, and
'shedding its last dying tints of red and gold over high
and low, II entered the beautiful city of Florenco.
Several days' tramp in the Apennines, which had been
undertaken with the hope of dispelling painful memories,
had quite exhausted me; but finding no peace anywhere,
I roai~cd on, little caring whither. After wandering for
somo time, ~o particular place in view, I at last
rested upon the ,ponte di &amp;tntct Trni~ita, the, most rioted
of the bridges that covers the Arno, as it flows gracefully
\ through that lovely city. There, I tried to amuse myself
by examining the statuary with which the bridge is
adorned, and by watching the gay promenaders who
assemble there in the evening. The pure Italian of those
Tuscans caine trippingly and musically from pretty lips,
and, fool that I was, I wondered how they could be so
merry when I was so wretched.. There were many
Americans and English people among the happy throng,
but, as I shunned mankind in, those days, they were un-
known to me, and I was indeed, 'a stranger in a strange
land.' Growing weary of this scene, I passed on, whither
I knew not, and cared less. At length, unintentionally, I
found myself at the entrance of the 'Church of Santa
Croce,' which is, as you know, the 'Westminster Abbey'
of Florence. j had been there before OW a visit to the
tqml)5 of Michael Angelo, Machiavelli, Galileo, Alfieri,
and' the other illustrious dead who sleep there, but had
never d~amed of attending service, for I thought myself
too wicl~ed even to enter. the house of God. however,
being just then in a fit mood to be swayed by the slightest
appeal to my overwrought and overtaxed senses, I yielded
to t~ie inclination which prompted me to follow the s~uud

of the organ, and entered the h~ly sanctuary. Locvv
ceilings. which were covered with frescoes by the old
masters; tall, Gothic windows of exquisitely sMined glass;
myriads of tinted sunbeams quivering upon the kneeling
multitude, and the music of seraphs burst upon me in
such beauty and grandeur as words cannot portray. As
I drank all this iii at one draught, although not a profes
sor of any religion, I involuntarily sank upon my kn~~s, and
with bowed head, remained immovable, even when The
con o'reo'ation arose. The service was soniewhat advanced
for it ~vas the hour of vespers, and all at once the most
~,n~ehic voice I have ever heard fluttered pleadingly
forth, then growing stronger and richer each moment, the
whole building seemed to tremble with melody.
"Times without number, I had prayed to die from
wretchedness, but on that evening I thought it would be
so sweet to 'pass away, while the senses were steeped in
such excess of rapture. '0 Salutaris ilostia 'had never
been sung before, and 'Tantum Ergo' sounded as if the
heavens had parted, that I might hear the eternal praises *
of the angelic host, as they reverberate day and night
around the throne of Jehovah. Finally the service was
concluded, the priests had gone, and, with the exception.
of a few devout ones, who told their beads in silence., the
congregation had all disappeared. The sunset had deep-
ened into twilight, and still the unseen organist played
'such divine music as was never heard before nor sifice,
and still I knelt, alQne and in the gloaming. ~ddenly
an insane desire seized me to behold the being who could
thus hold 'no riveted, as if by some potent speii. Rush~
lug, like a madman, to the loft, I there saw, by a dim
light, the most beautiful, and at the same time the ino~U

*   revolting sight that my eyes ever looked upon. A hor~
rid deformity, neither man nor beast, but a combination
of 1)0th, was before me. -To say that he was hunch-backed,
dwarfed, old, wrinkled, with skin like a Moor, and eyes
like a hyena, set in the head ~f a man, club-footed and
with hands like claws, would be but poorly describing the
man-benst who presided at the organ, and gave forth such
seraphim~ strains. Near a table, which was piled 'with
books and sheets of music, sat a young girl, who, horrible
to related, I afterward learned was the daughter of this
deformed genius, and the same person who sand so db
finely. She was pale, wan and weary, but lovely beyond
description, in her sisterhood's dresg, as, leaning her head
upon her hand, she gazed dreamily into vacancy. In-
stantly regretting my rashness, I lingered but a moment,
then turning hastiI~ away, left as noiselessly as I had en-
tered. The memory of the evening haunted me so that .1
could not sleep that night, and it was days before I could
dispel it ~rorn my mind. The remembrance of it lingers
with me in all its freshness, and will, no doubt, to my
dying day. But you ~re weary, and I must say 'good.
niohit.' "
"Good-night," she said, and, with a pressure of hands,
he was gone. Maud was deeply affected~ by this thrilling
little story, and as she sat thinking, she seemed to see the
deformed organist and the pale young girl, while the
music of seraphs filled the air. Was she dreaming, or
did an invisible host chant to her lonely and hungry
soul?

West, as they were enjoying a t~te-4-t~te one morning.

more of the x~orld before becoming positively betrothed."
"And pray~ what are your uncle's reasons for such
advice? A. man of his years does not generally act from
caprice and must have some good cause for thus advising
you."
"Oh, yes, he has his reasons," was said in a defensive

I sometimes think I am t3o happy in the possession of
such a priceless treasure as your love."
"And why ?"
"I do not know, unless I agree with the poet, who
says: 'The brightest still the fleetest,' and acknowledge
a secret dread that my treasure may be snatched away
from me."
"Poets are allowed much license, you know, and simply
because their words jingle and are pleasant to the ear,
they attempt to make their philosophy correspond."
~VWTeIl , y little darling'~ and so let it be in our
said in

while we set the world an enduring example of love and
constancy."
"With all 'my heart! But, then, they say also, 'There
is nothing constant but change.' Is that the constancy
you would have?" asked this little sprite archly.
"Why, what a meddler in philosophy you have grown,"
said Fred, his sparkling eyes bespeaking his idolatrous
admiration. "No, indeed! I would know nothing of con~
stant chang~ except that which is needful to supply your
wants, and surround you with elegance and comfort. But
surely you must have been reading Carlyle, or Haven, or

glances which from them shone.
"Say it ~ail, darling. IL could die to such sweet

little half-sighed rippling laugh that gushed forth, like
the timid twitter of a young song-bird.
"Oh, Fred I "exclaimed the pretty mouth, while a gen-
tle resistance was offered to his caresses; "you are mak-

Another kiss upon the tempting lips expressed his
thanks, though with something like a sigh, he said,

bright and cloudless as at this moment, what would 1'
'iiot give? But it will not-cannot be!" he coiftinued
sadly.
"Oh, Fred, why do you talk 80'?" was her anxious in-
quiry.
~(Becau5e~nothing!" was the abstracted reply. "Only
it i~ more of a blessing than we dare hope for."
"No, Fi'ed. Be honest That is not altogether t~he
reason of your sadness. Tell me, or I shall be iniser~
able."
As if forced to utter words from which lie would have
refrained, Fred looked into the dim and shadowy dis-
tauice, and said,
"Let me try as I ~ay to banish such thoughts, when-
ever I look forward ~o the future there is a dark cloud
that looms up before me, and envelops our' whole hod-

"Dear Fred!" tremblingly escaped her lips, as she
nestled more closely by his side, and a moment afterward
was sobbing, while her golden head related on his honest
breast.
"Pardon! a thousand pardons, sweet Daisy !" and
lifting up her face, he kissed the great tears from her
silken:fi inged eyelids.
She smiled, and a child-like laugh followed. "I am
foolish and nervous, Fred."
lie smiled as well, with another and another kiss.
"Thus let me ever bring sunshine after the shower, Daisy.
We are both rather cliildi~h, I am inclined to think. But
let us away with gloomy forebodings. Perhaps, after all,
it is only an envious, cruel phantom, which comes to mock
our happiness."

feverish hand; "and it is said such fancies often spring''
from an over-taxed brain. Promise me you will not con~

"I must tear myself away; but promise when I have gone
there shall be no ,tears."
I promise!" she said, ~ith a futile attempt at bravery,
between a smile and a tear; and releasing herself from
the clasp of his strong arm around her waist, she retreated,
while the glow of rapture at her heart crimsoned her
cheeks, and she sank again upon the cushion to dream of
a happy future.
CHAPTER XVIIL
"OM4Y WAITING!"
. AITING for what ?-for whom? For an event
or for a person? If for the former, what was it?
If for the latter, who was it?
i~eadei', have you never felt a vague unrest, which
could n~t l)e accounted for by any, prophetic demonstra-
tio~ uf the past-an undefined something, you knew not
* what.--afata morfctnct, 'an ignisfatt&amp;u~, which lured you
on arid on, and then left you to grope alone in midnight

darkness or mystery inexplicable? An invisible power
impelling you forward, you knew not whither, until y~n
were lost in mist and clouds, while myriads of fch hut
unseen sprites mocked and jeered at your cieduli~y?
If you have never, known this,-if you have never felt
the aching void of the unrest, or the mysterious snr~
i'oundhig of these invisible but powerful impelling
agencies,-if busy demons have never tempted or goaded
you to peel' iiito the inscrutable, or to attempt to span the
breadth of infinitude, it is well, and the blissfulness of
ignorance reaches heights of sublimity.
"Only waiting!"
Her air was listless, her manner abstracted; she wan~
dered around the house-out of, yet in the body-in a
maze. Sometimes in her dreams she was borne into
illimitable space, but to fall from dizzy heights, or sink
into fathomless depths of strange speculation. At other
times she felt as if floating on. the immeasurable expanse
of waters, like "leaves along the limpid streams of Eden,"
soon to be rudely tossed back upon "Mother 32artl~"
The hoped-for haven seemed often to be almost reached,
-so near that the prow of her lY~at well nigh touched
the glittering strand; but it was all mockery-only an
illusion; for a fathomless whirlpool seethed and tossed
just before her, and sense and feeling bade her take in her
sail and reverse the action of her oars: she therefore ~at
"waiting-only waithig!"
Ye who have had your footsteps tracked by this invis-
ible and shapeless something, must know full well how it~
Wrings the heart with anguish, how it causes "Cimm~
nan dai'l~i~es~" to reign~at high noon, how the feet must ~
travel the pathway alone; for this grim, unsoci~b1e ~


~'ONLY WAITING!"            121

120             ~ONLY WAITING!"'

rience admits no human coinpanionship, and scoffs at
human sympathy-even the possibility of it. It is the
inevitable foe~ with whom so many are condemned to
wage warfare, unaided, as they sit "waiting only,,
waiting." Grieve not, but "8uft'~e~, and be 8t~ong.".
,Maud'~ gay companions were not ignorant of, nor blind
to, the changes that had come over her; but in response
to the kindly inquiriess' as to what was the matter, she in-
variably replied, "Nothing!"
"Nothinol" A world of meaning 'may be conveyed
in that "on~ word." What yearnings unsat.isfled,
what tears withheld,--what heart-aches endured,-what
misery inconceivable,-what hopes blighted,-what love
~nutold! All these, and how incomprehensibly much
more may be understood in that trite little dissyllable.
But Colonel ll~rtridge was mercifully blind to all this
tumult that raged in the heart of his wife, and which
was wearing her life away, like the continual dripping
that melts the' stone. Why? Simply because he was too
much with his business , and too little with his wife.
True, every temporal want was diligently looked after
and supplied; and what right has. a wife to expect more?
So she is fed and. clothed and housed, and the comforts
which speak to 'the oal;side world are not neglected, it
matters not how or in what manner-according t6 the
received rules of social ethics-duty is done, and carping
tongacs silenced. The world does not consider it cruel
for the husband to be cold, silent, abst~'acted, unsocial,
J inattentive, undemonstrative; but it is. thought' worse
n crimiuai for a wife's heart to yearn fo~' that love and
sympathyy which every trusting,, loving womaii needs,
though it may be denied her from the proper source.

But who can control the heart; and what Herculean
power is there with streno'th sufficient to still human
yearnings?
Men may preach and men may practise,-they may
trammel the impulses of the heart, and place in th hands
of conscience the spear and the rod,-bnt just ~a '~iirely
will coldness and neglect send a woman's in
search of th~ympathy and warmth, the affectio~g and
J tender~~with6ut which it freezes and dies, as the Hower,
confined~to cold and darkness, will lift its sickly branches
to the one ray of sunlight which pierces its prison cell.
iMlaud Ilartridge had all the outward appliances of
comfort, but she yeai'ned for kindly words, delicate atten~
tions, the numberless little evidences of a thoughtful
husband's care and love. But they came not, and a deep
melancholy pervaded her life, as she was "waiting-o
waiting."
It was a dismal, dreary evening, and the wind sighed as
mournfully around the eaves of the house, as if freighted
with thq~piteous wails of the lost. Maud sat before a fire
of glowing edals, gazing into the blue blazes, as if trying
to read in them what the future might hold in store for
her. There was a theatrical celebrity in the city, whom
the girls had gone to see; and, as usual, Colonel Hart-
ridge had business at the office which detained him, and
the young wife was alone.
A ring at the door-bell startled her; not that it was a
thing unusual, but she had grown nervous of late, ~nd a
sudden sound would set her heart to wilder throb~ and
her pulses to quicker beats. Supposing it was eithe~' her
husband, or some visitor of the young ladies, the r~ierie;
momentarily broken, w~s in a measure ~'esumeci~ but to

be instantly dissipated as Mr. D'Estaing entered the
room; and, with a smile, she cried out,
~" Why, what a sad truant you have been!"
"I am sure I have been the only loser," he replied,
gratefully pressing the hand extended to him, "and am
almost repaid by knowing that I have been considered a
'truant,' foi~ that may imply more than I had dared
hope."
"If you wish it to imply that you have been missed
during the ctqe we have not seen you, then your vanity
may be gratified. We have missed you dreadfully."
"You are very kind; thanks! However, I owe you
an apology for my informal en1tr~e; I thought, of course,
you were at the theatre, and only stopped in passing to
leave a book, when the servant told me at the door you
were in the library; and IL assure you the temptation was
too strong to resist. Therefore my entrance unanw
nouncdd. Can I hope to be. forgiven?"
"Without doubt," laughed Maud. "You attach won-
derful importance to ceremony, I see."
"But Ii fear I frightened you."
"Oh, no; I was a little startled, I confess,. at the ring-
ing of the bell, but that i~ nothing new. ii find I have
become so nervous latterly, that I shrink even from im-
aginary things."
"You cannot be well 1" and scrutinizing her closely he
was strui~k with her excessive pallor. "But here is the

her lips, as she discovered the book to be an elegantly
illustrated copy of Owen Meredith's "Lu~ile." Just
then her eye fell upon the fly-leaf, and she saw written
thereon, "A Souven~ir, February, 186-." Simple enough,
assuredly, and an additional proof of the faultless taste
of the~ man who never seemed to overdo anything.
After a moment or two, she raised her eyes, eloquent ol
thanks for this token of hi~ remembrance. "flow can 1
be grateful enough," she said, in a low, deep voice, "for
your kindness. I have been very anxious for this book
and shall prize it more highly than any thing you could
have given me."
"A mere trifle," said he. "Your enthusiastic ~dmir~
ation for the work makes you value so highly the form
in which it comes to you."
She made no answer to this remark, for in a forgetful
manner, sh~ was eagerly turning the leaves, and enjoying
the* fragrance of a few fresh violets which had been
thoughtfully strewn between them.
D'Estaing watched her, weikpleased; and after study-
ing the illustrations, she looked up and said rather impa~
tiently,
"But you must like 'Lucile?'"

for was not her coquetterie the catise of all her suffers

"Oii the contrary, I thjnk it was a keen sense of honor
which sent her lover back to his betrothed, and left her
desolate."
"Yes; but prior to that, when Sir Alfred was free to
wed her?"
"Well, it is useless ,to. argue this subject again," said
Maud, rather impatiently, "for each discussion but
entrenches us more firmly in our opposite convic-
tions, and II see no hope for either one* to be convinced
that the other is wrong~ Though I should have known
that it is impossible for one of your sex to understand or
appreciate such lifelong, unwavering devotion as that of
'Lucile,' because you cannot love as a woman can."
"I think you do us injustice," he said, with a smile;
"and believe nie, such is the onlkind of love I should

feelings her wifely honor would fain have concealed, ske
said, in a bantering way:
"Dear me! how very sentimental we are becoming; "
and added, laughing, "perhaps~yes, doubtless-you hava
enjoyed what you so feelingly portray."
"Do you think, then, I would now be the lonely wan~
derci' I am, had such happiness been mine?"
"A woman sent Moreau to the deserts."
"Yes; but Moreau and I are different men. Such a
giddy butterfly as wrecked his life could never inspire me
with a feeling above contempt.?'
"You are fortunate to be so impervious to :beauty'8
charms."
"I admire beauty only when it is linked with virtue.
No; the woman whom I shall love must possess a soul a~
deep, as fervent, and as true as my own; then we shall
both love, not for a day or a month, but for all time."
Thus'did these friends lay bare their hearts-the ou.~
to the other; and a secret satisfaction filled them muta..'
ally, when they discovered that the one but reiterated the
sentiments of the other.
Maud made no comment on his last remark. her
gaze was fasteiuied upon the glowing cinders, while
D'Estaiug feasted his eyes upon her classic profile.

And throwing her head back against the rich, gay cow
ering of the fc&amp;uteuil she occupied; she looked up into hi~
face with an expression of disappointment on her coun-
tenance.
"Duty compels, or you do not know how happy it
would make me to remain," was the earnest reply which
sent the warm blood tingling through her veins, and crini~
zoning her pale brow. "Besides, I shall have to drop in

"Good-night!" said INland, and after a warm pressure
~of han~, he bowed himself gracefully from the room,

thing tugging at his heart-strings; while she whom he

~THE RAINY DAY.~
"Be still, sad heart and vase refining;

I
STIFF north-east wind had prevailed 'for several
days, and a blinding mist, accompanied now and
then with sleet, was still falling. Thewliole city
was enveloped in a haze that bore a close resemblance to a

London fog, and it required unusual faith to believe that
"behind the cloud the sun was ~till shining." Such
days are dreary enough tQ those who are surrounded by

suffering from cold arid hunger, as they sit lmddled to~

daf brings. Search well your heart; probe carefully
your conscience; ask whether you have done your whole
duty to your fellow-creatures: to the starving, who are so
ffliserable; to the weak, who are so helpless; to the timid,
who are full of fears; to the bereft, who are so desolate;
F     and then return to your girded and mirrored boudoir, and
fret over the rainy day, which robs your delicate lace robe
-the flimsy adornment of your vanity-of some of its
crispness. IRernember too, while puerile repinings distort
your classic features, that when the night shall close in
upon this day, it will be a day dead forever! The howl-
ings of the wind, and the shrieks of the tempest are but
indifferent precursors of gladness and sunshine to the
physical universe; and fretfulness and selfishness are
scarcely prophetic of happiness and contentment on the
morrow; bright sunshine* and cheerful breezes for the
mental horizon.
On on6 of these dark, dreary days, the ladies of a cer~
tam household were gathered in a cosy little sitting-room
with Which the reader is already familiar. The glowing
fireTendered the apartment too warm for comfort, and
contrasted strangely with the cold and rain without. The
rose-tinted walk painted the cheeks of the inmates with a
becoming color, and the canary birds in the conservatory
trilled merrily; the flowers filled the air with delicate
odors, while altogether 'the scene was one of tropical
beauty and exquisite softness.
iMilaud was absorbed in " Corneth up as a flower," that
dashing, daring, original conceptiOn of a sixteen-year old

grammatical or social conventionalism; and which is full
of the quaintest superlatives, and the ~provokinge8t and

most questionable naturalness. Daisy was deep in th~
last number of the "London Court Journal ;" deep in
wonder as to how Lady this, and Lady that, looked in vel-
vet and gossamer, train, and laces, and jewels, at the last
drawing-room of her Majesty; while Kate paced the
floor with impatience, at being con dned in doors."
A constraint, which almost amounted to indubitable
embarrassment, had been perceptible of late in the inter..
course of these three friends; but it was never referred
to. There were IIQ more midnight conferences, when
women grow confidential over d~jdng embers, as men do
over their wine. No more experiences were exchanged,
and each one seemed either entirely self-reliant, or wholly
self-occupied.
What was the cause of it? What had happened~?
When one is happy it is not necessary to whisper it se~
cretly to a few friends, for the whole world knows and
feels it. happiness is electrical. It permeates the at..
mosphere, and extends its circles, out and out through all
the regions of spiritual sympathy, until it writes itself
wherever feeling is known, bearing hope on it~ wings, and
light to the deepest midnight that ever groomed a human
soul.
And this was the case with blithe little Daisy. When
one s conscience is ill ~at ease, its accusations are usually
ended in silence, and the sufferer shrinks from the pry..
ing eyes of investigation, rather than from human sym..
pathy; even as he would like to shun the eye of the All-
Seeing.
By slow degrees Maud had arrived at this unpleasant
condition. When one is discontented without cause, un~
happy without reason, exposure to a friend ih deprecated~.

~nd the laying bare of the heart i~ likC eXposil g fever~
S.sh and festering wounds to the action of the fro~ty air
of midwinter; so they endure, rather thati court con-
dolence. Poor Kate had learned to feel this; and
whether c~r not her troubles were imaginary, she suffered
equally. Is it not sad to know that neither of these three
young women had ever knowA a mother's care; had
ever been taught at a mother's knee; or had ever been
schooled in those invaluable lessons of patience and for-
bearance, best taught from a mother's lips, by a mother's
experience?
"When will it ever cease raining, I wonder!" fell
jarringly upon the heavy silence that pervaded the room.
There was no reply ~ and Kate seemed talking only to
hcr~elf, as she stood at the ~ ndow gazing out on the
~~ceIy more than dense, impalpable mist.
"Foil days it ha~ poured incessantly, and now the sky
is almost black, and forebodes a continuation of inclem-
ent weather. I think I shall put on my water-proof suit
~nd Polish boots, and go out for a talk despite the rain.
Will you not join rue, Daisy?"
Yes, yes ~ '~ said Daisy abstractedly, without raising
her eyes from the subject-matter of the Princess ~oyal's
i~ose-colored velvet robe, ostrich tips, and diamonds.
"But----i'e&amp;Ily, i(ate, ekcnse me! What did you say?"
was the impatient rejoinder. "(.)f course
~ young lady ~ufferipg from an acute attack of heart-
disease is expected to be affected also with that corre-
sponding disease, 'absence-of-mind.' I only wish Guy
would come once more, and then I could defy alike the
raging storr~ without and th~ dead calm within."
"Mr. Wi'therell would certainly feel complimented if

he knew how much he was missed and lamented," said
Daisy, nonchalantly.
Kate's face turned crimson at this supposed taunt, and
walking up to Maud, she demanded, rather than asked,
"What oii earth did you say to Guy that morning you
were closeted in the library with him? It has been three
weeks since then. Did you order him from the house?"
"&amp;~ertainly not, Kate."
"Do you know where he is?"
"No!" was the calm, laconic reply.
"Can you tell why lie never comes near us any moreV'
"I think I can."
"Then do tell me! Why have you not told me this
before?"
Her voice trembled, and she sank upon her knees be.
side Maud.
"Because, dear, I am not at liberty to tell;" and as
she twined her arms tenderly around Kate's neck, and
kissed her flushed cheek, the wayward girl burst into
tears.
With native delicacy Daisy left the room, and, closing
the door softly behind her, left INland and Kate alone.
The pause was an unbroken one. Maud did not know
what to say by way of consolation to her capriciona
friend, so she stroked her, brown hair in silence. At
length, however, when Kate's sobs had grown fainter and
shorter, a furious ring of the door-bell startled t~em~ A.
moment afterward a familiar voice in the hail was heard
crying out,
"Where is everybody?"
Instantly the trio recognized Guy's voice, and rush~4
t0 the hall to give him welcome. Kate was first on tho

IDaisy brought up the rear.
Then followed volleys of kisses and embraces, difficult
to decide by xvhom accomplished; and bestperhaps, left
t~ conjecture. They dragged, rather than led him into
the reception-room, saying, as with a sin gle voice,
"Where have you been all this time?"
"If one at a time will ask me, I shall try to answer
their questions."
"Tell me first, then!" exclaimed Kate, smiles peeping
out of her dimples, and laughter beaming through tears.
"Are your nerves sufficiently well tempered to bear a
rude shock?"
"II am, mercifully, nerveless; so go on
"Why, what a female prodigy!"
"I cannot bear comment. IL only wish to know where
you have been all this time?"
"Don't be too inquisitive, Kate; or you may hear
of somethingg to my disadvantage. No man is justifiable
in the eye of the law in criminating himself; nor is it
hardly fair to expect a man to be willing to blast his own
reputation."
A laugh followed this diplomatic parry, while Maud, in
mock concern, said,
* "I was just about to hang crape on the door for you.*"
"And I was about to put on mourning," said Daisy.
fAnd I was thinking of advertising you as 'lost,
strayed, or stolen,'" added Kate.
"Upon my soul!" cried Guy, "it is a greaf pity I
didn't stay-well-drunk!"
"Oh, Guy!" burst from the lips of his fair auditors,
with a show of consternation painted on their faces.

"I moan lost! " he exclaimed.
"Ali, that's better!" said iMlaud, laughing. "For I

But tins conversation is entirely too one-sided! Tell me
what youi have all been doing during this Rip-Van.

"N~thing! absolutely nothing'!" cried Kate.
"What! No parties, balls, weddings, operas, theatres,

monotony?"
"Not even a hand-organ, oVa monkey," said Kate.
"This ~vilI never do; we must arouse the natives some-

"I have a treat in store for you," said IMlaud, "but
hadn't I better reserve it for the nexf rainy day?"
"No, no; let us have it now!" came as from one
voice.
"Well, Colonel llartridge proposes that I shall give

"And nephew," added Guy.
"If you xviii have it so," said Thud kindly. "And ho

"Oh, a masquerade, by all means!" exclaimed Kate in
delight.
"Well, it is to be left to the vote, and I am to infor*n
him of the decision at dinner, so that he may order the;

"What is your choice,' Daisy?"
"I have no preference," she answered, "bat will 0R~

THE MASQUERADE BALL.

"Suppose we say a fancy-dress ball, without masks,"
suggested Maud.
"Oh, that would spoil all the fun," cried Kate; "be-
sides, I have a fancy for personating a dozen different
characP~rs."
"Anything to please then," said Maud, with her usual
amiability.
"And a mask-ball it shall be!" pursued Kate tri-
umphantly.
Just then a flood of sunlight poured into the room, and,
as if to leave nothing undone that would add to the en-
joyment of the hour, the quartette retreated to the piano,
aud sang the merriest, most san8 8OUC~ songs which be.

for all of these accessories had been sirnilated in the
decorations of the house. Myriads of wax tapers threw

their ~uft and becoming light upon the guests, who repre-
sented almost every clime and race; rare exotics exhaled
delicious perfumes, to which were added the odor of
burning censors, and enchanting music thrilled the soul
with joy. The crowd was so great that Colonel Hart~
ridge and IMlaud made their exit unobserved, a~ they ro..
tired to don their costumes, now that they thought they
were through receiving.
A fearful storm raged without, and it seemed as if the
carnival of joy within and the carnival of terror without
had thrown down the gauntlet to leach other, to see which
could be the most reckless. What did it matter to that
gay and giddy throng hQw many ships went down that
iiiglit? What did they care for the little bare-footed
ones who wandered out in the streets, and whose, only
shelter was the raving elements? Sorrow and suffering
were ignored by these children of fortune, and reckless
gayety ruled the hour.
Maud had neither the eyes, hair, nor complexion for
"Mai'ie Antoin~tte," but had consented to personate the
character to please the Colonel, who was arraying himself
in all the regal splendor of th~ much beloved and cruelly
persecuted Louis.
Their costumes had been sent from 1~ew York, at a
great expense, and would have done credit to the persons
represented during their reign, for they were reaUy~
gorgeous. In dressing hurriedly, Maud had failed t~
observe a tiny bouquet that lay upon the toilette, until
her maid tailed her attention to it, saying one .of the
servants had brought it to the door, and left it for het

it to her, she opened it, with trembling fingers, and reads
* a disguised hand, the following words:
"If not inconsistent with the character you represent,
wear these flowers."
Scarcely giving the note a thought, and fancying it
was some trick of the girls or Guy, she suddenly remem~
bered that the proud Austrian beauty was the first prim!
cess who ever dared to wear natural flowers, and saying,
"how very opportune," exchanged the artificial roses in
her corsage for this gift of nature, from an unknown
hand. Just then her husbaAd entered, and after much
mutual admiration, they drew on their masks, made their
exit by a private way, and entering the front door, were
duly announced, as the other guests~ had been. The
reception room was rather empty at that hour, and after
a mock attempt to find the host and hostess, they wended
their way to the dancing-saloon. Their costumes attracted
considerable attention, and all eyes were turned upon
them as they entered. Maud~was at once surrounded by
a bevy of gay rnaskers, and yielding to their importunities,
was soon whirling in the mazy dance; nor did she imagine
that the little bouquet had already betrayed her to a
pair of eager eyes that* were earnestly watching her
fi'oin the conservatory.
At length, dizzy from the whirl of the dance, suffocat-
ing with the heat of the room, sickened by the odor of
the perfumed air, she stepped into the conservatory,
hoping to recover herself there unobserved; and Heaven
knows there wa~ no treachery in her heart to any human
being when she took that fatal step. A momentary
faintness came over her, everything swam around, and
she fell forward. Quick as thought, a man, with a Roman

toga folded around him, and a hat drawn over his eyes
sprang from behind an orange tree, and supported her ii~
his arms. Tier mask was instantly thrown up, a fervent
kiss was imprinted upon lie~ lips, and a well-known voice
murmured softly, "liLy darling."
But the impassioned words fell unheeded, for conscious.
ness was gone, and did not return until a loving hand
was dipped in the fountain, and somiie of the crystal water
therefrom was sprinkled upon her face. Upon opening
her eyes, what was her horror to find D'Estaing bending
anxiously above her, while words of love came trembling~
from his lips.
Shrinking from his embrace, she sank upon a seat near
by, and sighed heavily, as she buried her face in her
hands.
Leaning over her, D'Estaing said, in a husky voi~e,
"You wear my flowers-I have discovered you.-wifl
you keep your word and grant my request?"
Recalling her foolish words of.'the day before, when she
had promised to grant any request to the one who should
discover her, she tore the flowers from her bosom, and
dashing them indignantly at his feet, said,
"The ruse was dishonorable-the words were a jest,"
and arising', she would have left his presence, but a feeling
of faintness compelled her to sink again upon the ottoman.
Kneeling at her feet; he seized her hands, and in an
cited voice said,
"Why seek to close our eyes, and steel our hearts to
the truth? We love-I know it-I feel it; and if it is a
crime to love you, how gladly will I pay the penalty.
Stay but a moment, and tell me that you do not hate me

for my rashness. Say that you will forgive me, and think
of me kindly, my darling one."
She looked np-they exchanged one burning glance.
It was enough! "Eyes looked love to eyes which spake
again," and what they saw written therein made their
hearts leap with joy. But it was the joy that is linked
wil'h despair; and so thought Maud, as she sank at his feet
and said, in a tone of agony,
"Lectve me-if you love me-1etve me!"
Yes, leave her, while there is yet time. Fly from her;
put seas and oceans and distant lands between you.
But wherefore?
The work is done, and distance cannot blot it from the
heart. Still clasping her hands, and bending above ~her
kneeling figure, he said, in a whisper,
"lfIlov9you!"
Then pressing his lips to her pale brow, he slowly went
his way, and she was left alone.
Alone with her own heart, which in that brief period
had sent forth, in a torrent, all its pent-up love, and she
worshipped where it was crime to worship.
This little heart-sc~e had occupied only a fewminutes,
but when iMlaud arose, and tried to force back the tears
which were bursting from her heart, she felt as if an age
had passed over her head since she entered that lovely
~spot. There was little time for reflection, however, for
her maid soon entered, and said that Colonel Ilartridge
desired her presence, so that the guests might unmask
and go in to supper. Speedily joining him, at a given
signal the masks were withdv~wn, and many were the
amusing scenes that then occurred, for all had sustained
their characters so admirably that there had been hut few

discussed with avidity the delicacies and luxuries which
were there spread before them, and nothing seemed want~
ing to ~dd to the happiness of the hour. fl6~he' ~er~
formed the duties of hostess the remainder of the evening
was a mystery to Maud, for her thoughts had fob
lowed her heart, and she desired above all things to be
alone. A delicious "German" followed supper, which
lasted until the sombre, leaden light of a gloomy day
warned the guests to depart. At length, adieux were
spoken, the "maddest, merriest." night was gone, and the
most'brilliant ball of the season was a thing of the past.

clutched the iron railing, and her pale blue eyes, though
glazed in ileath, still turned toward the dancing saloon,
where the bright lights and sounds of music had lured
her to her death. Why did she not wander on?
Then, tattered and torn as were the rags, which poorly
hid her fragile limbs, she might still have lived and not
been cold and stark in death, a reproach to those who
revelled in luxury, and forgot the poor, who wandered
out in the streets.
With heart on fire. and brain in a whirl, when she
reached her room, IMlaud had thrown herself in exhaustion
upon a lounge. She could not sleep, for thought was too
busy, heart too full. After a few moments an unusual
noise in the house made her spring nervously up to mn~
quire the cause. A presentiment of something horrible
rushed over her, and following the sound ,jof voices and
footsteps, she went hastily below stairs. in the hall she
almost ran against her husband, who bor~ in his arms
what appeared to be a lifeless child. ~From whence had
she come? where had they found her? were questions
which IMlaud asked herself, but no word was spoken, for
one and all seemed struck dumb with horror, and they fol~
lowed mechanically the Colonel and his hapless burden
into the late dancing saloon. Laying her tenderly upon
a sofa, he felt her pulse, and shaking his head ominously,
said,
~" I fear all is over with her."
No word escaped Maud's lips, but the agony she felt,
was written in her fade, as she sank down by the side of
the unknown guest that death had ushered into their
midst. Scalding tears rained down her face, and fell
npon the pale, pinchea cheeks of the little strange~', and

she chafed the tiny hands, as if that would warm her back
to life again. Kate~and Daisy knelt beside her, and theit
half-smothered sobs, mingling with those 9f the ~e~'vants
of the household, grated upon the silence that reigned in
~ the chamber of death. A more striking picture can
scarcely be imagined than was there presented, as the
grayish morning light, weirdly blending with the flicker~
ing waxen tapers, fell upon the glittering ball-dresses of
the three beautiful women, who knelt around the death~
couch of the ragged innocent. Alas! tears and sympathy
were unavailing then, for they had come too late. Why
did they not protect he~ from the exposure, and snatch her
from the starvation which laid her dead at their thres~.
hold? Remember, children of plenty, that while yesit
refining, the grim monster is abroad in the land, and ye
might balk his inhuman appetite by even a crust of
bread. Quick! to the rescue!!
For what grander benevolence can there be, than to
"feed th6 hungry, and clothe the naked"? A physician
had retYirned with Colonql Hartridge, every restorative
had been applied, but in vain, for the little wanderer slept
the last sleep. Taken from sorrow to come, she had gone
where neither cold nor hunger should be felt any more.-
The city had been aroused and shocked by th6 horrid
eventhere recorded, and many kind people came to pi~of~
fer their assistance. The police were making every effort
to trace the little one, to find if there was any frenzied
mother, or ~grief-stricken father, who were in search of
their lost child. In the meanwhile, Maud and the girls
performed, for the first time, the last sad duties for the hap-
less innocent, and the room that had only a few hours
before been the scene gf mirth and gayety was unexpe*

edly changed into a chamber of Death. They clothed
her in dainty robes, and surrounded her with calnellias)
which rivalled the marble whiteness of her pallid cheeks,
and as she laid there; so still and cold, who could have told
that gentle blood did not flow in her veins? lit is well
for these poverty-stricken ones, that, unlike man, God is
no respecter of persons, or the deserving might be cast
into "outer darkness" in the next world, as they some~
times are in this. Low sobs, which came from strangers'
hearts, broke the awful solemnity of the occasion, and si-
lent tears trickled down Maud's cheeks as she watched by
the couch of the dead. She had taken no rest, .although
the girls and her husband had pleaded with her to do so,
and it was a positive relief from her own tempest-tossed
feelings to assume the woes of others. As a dim-remem-
bered air will sometimes come, when least expected, so a
s1o v and measured step fell strangely across the stillness.
Maud raised her tear-stained face to :flnd D'Estaing gaz-
ing at her ii~ an appealing way which spoke volumes.
They exchanged but a glance, and yet, in that 'one look,
they both read the anguish of each other's hearts. her
head sank, aad. when she looked up again th~ bier was
strewn with flowers, but he who placed them there was
'gone. The day was n~w far spent, and still no clue to
the heart-rending tragedy came to clear away the mys-
- tery in which it was enslirouded. Suddenly there caine
from the depths of the deep silence a woman'S shrieks.
They rent the air, and made space hideous, and the female
monster, who thus rudely entered the presence of the dead,
threw herself in an agony of grief across tlfe breast of h~r
little one. The rags which partly covered her person
were filthy, her tawny hairj~ung in tangled masses around

her neck, while the deep lines which furrowed her bloated
fac~ were unmistakable evidences of debauch and de4
pravity; and yet this inhuman creature was a mother.
lIol~ name, what sacrilecr ! Raising the child up, and
folding her in her arm~ as if to force her back to life, be-
tween tears and sobs, she pleadingly said,
"Come back, IMiamie, and be mother's little pet once
more. Mother was drunk - mother was cruel-but
mother will not be so any more. Mother will never leave
you again, and go to those wicked places. Oh, speak to
me once more, my little darling. Open your blue eyes,
and smile on mother once more. Dead-dead-no~no
-no-not dead." And her shrieks again burst forth, and
with them were mingled the pitiful wails of a child's
grief, as little Henry Wood said,

"Come back, Mamie. I'll be your horsey; you shall
vide on my back as much as you please; Buddie lost you

could not hear his little voice. Maud drew liin'4 to her,
and tried to. make him understand that " Manie" had
gone to live with the angels in heaven, and that if he was
a good boy, God would take him up there some day, too,

and hunger, he fell asleep.
Attracted by the lights and music which proceeded
from the house of the llartridges, Mamie, iw childish do~
light, had clung to the iron railing until the icy arms of
death were clasped about her. The wretched mother
was still in a drunken stupor when the officers had ar-
rived at her hut of poverty,, and they were only able to
identify the lost child by Henry's description, whom
'they found Bitting in the door of his miserable home, cry-
ing bitterly for his little sister. At first, they could not
inal~e the unhappy mother understand her loss, or of
what they sp~ke; but finally, when the truth flashed upon
her, and she felt that she had murdered her child, such a
paroxysm of grief and reproaches ensued, as was horrible
to witness.

CHAPTER XXH.
LENTEN DAYS.
TME for Reflection, time for Introspection, time
for Retrospection, was found in the quiet of the
sacred Lenten days, that followed so closely upon
the tragedy enacted in the last chapter. The miserere
of Him who was crucified was being chanted, and the
solemn festivities of the Occasion

To those who regard the holy season of Lent, it will
ever be suggestive of those trying days in the wilderitess,
when prayer and fasting were necessary even for the Son
of the most High. All men have their dark days, butAo
they fast and pray for strength to resist the seductive
voice of the tempter? Do they try to help themselves in
asking God, to help them, or do they viaiiily fancy that
the intercessions of His Son and His great mercy will do
the work? The example of the blessed Saviour p&amp;nts to
the contrary. The Bible teaches that He both morti~ed
the body and humbled the spirit, before even lie was
aI)le to triumph over "the the an4 ~he

flow much more essential, then, that men, po~r worms
of the dust, should follow in his footsteps, before they
can ever hope to begin, as it were, the beginning of a new
life? Why do they sit refining, and asking, "What
have I done to deserve this?"
In their selfishness and egotism they forget that it is
by God's mercy and not by his justice that they live at
all; that by his goodness alone they enjoy the blessings
which are showered upon them.
Excitement, loss of sleep, and mental anguish, com~
bined with that horrid tragedy, had completely, prostrated
Maud; and for weeks she wa~ the victim of that peculiar
form of nervous depression, which is more to be dreaded,
than physical pain. Oh I the struggle of those days!
Tier efforts were worthy of success; but without the aid
of ddne grace, all attempts at reform are futile.
"What are human resolves? Straws upon the wind-
the feather on the ocean. Things made to be broken, or
erased, like the name on the sand! What are the best
laid plans of men ~ Castles in the air!',
Thus thought Maud, as in her vain attempts to cast her
idol from her heart, she would find it reinstated, with
fresh impulses to worship. Like that other Maud-Maud
Muller-the rare and exquisite conception of the New
England Quaker poet-she wept and thought, "It might
have been I"
Not now. Heavens! No I She was another's! And
she would spring from her couch, like some guilty wretch,
aiid ~huddei' when remembering what treachery it was to
allow her thoughts to wander over such criminal gronild.
Thus day after day of indecision and shattered hopes
weiit,~by bringing additional misery with each s~cceediiig

hour, for when did transgression ever give anything else
in the shape of reward than suffering? ('Be sure your~
sins shall find ye out I She did, not pray: she couk~ -
not. She knew nothing as yet of casting her weary bur.

carrying it; and "the long, long weary days," made her
sigh and fea~.

over her and she failed to comprehend how a Christian's
bark may be tossed by adverse winds, even to a haven of
peace-of "that peace which passeth all understanding."
Like many who had gone before, she was gropiDg in
"the Valley of the Shadow of Death;" and instead ~&amp;f-
humbling her rebellious heart, and asking guidance, she
foolishly relied upon pledges made to herself to suatain
her.

- 1rn~gth a sense of duty aroused Maud. By a desperate
~effort she once more joined the family circle, but she was
so pale and depressed as to arouse anxious solicitude in
her behalf. In answer to the kindly and frequent inqui.
ries relative to her health, she~ would simply say, "It is
iiothi no'? I shall feel better by and by."
Better "by and by!" Heaven grant she may, poor
woman!
As soon as her strength permitted, she accompai1ied her
young friends in their daily attendance upon div ne ser~

was becoming a better creature. Yam delusion I ]IMd

ful localities around the city were thronged with pleas.
ure seekers. Picnics and moonlight excursions followed
in quick succession, and the whole population; ,from the
infant to the gray-haired man and woman, save those
whom Poverty had bound upon her immolating, tear-
stained, sigh-breathing altar, entered with zest into tlie~e
animal festivities.
Upon the ~ay in, question, rather,, a select party had
gone to the "Isle of Hope," and, judging by indications,
their spirits~ x~ere as bright as the cloudless sky above.
Light figures flitted here and there, while upon a plat.
form erected for the purpose, the dancers enacted "the
poetry of motion " to inspiring music. Beneath the grand
old oaks, with their graceful drapery of long moss, were
groups '~f the gay revellers, indulging in various games.,
Pleasure boats with happy occupants were floating lazily
upon the waters, and, in all its detail the picture was
pleasing beyond description.
The party had gone out in the afternoon with the in-
tention of returning by moonlight, and as "the charmed
sunset lh~gered low adown in the red west," the banquet
was spread and pai~taken of, with appetites sharpened by
fresh air and exercise. Wit and repartee lent additional
Lest to the meal, and as the dying sunbeams kissed the
trees and played upon the waters~ the gay party dis
perked to other enjoyments. Weary alike of cards, dan-
cing and talking, Maud IIartridge cheerfully accepted aii
invitation from Captain Beall for a sail. Her husband,
having been debarred the pleasure of joining the ex~ur-
~iou, had eutrustd her to the care of this gentleman, who
~vas an old and iiitimate friend. He was an accomplished

scholar, but unfortunately boating had not been in6lnded
in his education, and INland was evidently amused t~t the
awkwardness with which he used the oars.
Amid deafening shouts and gushing rills of laughter,
a closely contested boat-race was just beYng concluded,
but not participating they only skirted the shore and
skimmed the "crisping ripples" which reflected the"
moonlit sky above.
The undertaking was hazardous, and was rendered
doubly so by the excited manner of the Captain; the
cause of which can be easily inferred.
A desultory conversation was sustained at first, but it
soon lapsed into silence as Maud grew thoughtful, and
the effects of the wine began to be felt by her escort.
Thus, mentally occupied, they failed to appreciate the
danger which threatened them, and were only aroused by
a heavy shock, as the boat struck violently against~Jree
which obstructed their way. It was instantly capsized~
and a moment afterwards, they were both struggling in
the waters. Neither of them could swim: no help was
near-no human being in sight; the pleasure-boats had all
returned, and death seemed inevitable. As quick as
lightning a man sprang from his hiding-place under the
overhanging boughs where he was concealed, and plung~
ing into the water, soon gained the scene of the disaster,
The moon was shining in full-orbed, undimmed bright
ness, and just at that moment Maud came to the surfae~
for the second time; but her clothes becoming entangled.
in 'the drooping limbs of the tree, she must have perished.
but for the timely assistance of this unexpected deliverer.
Seizing her, with one arm around her waist, he managed,
by the aid of the swaying branches, to draw himself with

his burden from the water; and when he reached the
shore, to his horror beI~e1d, in the clear moonlight, the pale
but beautiful features of the woman he so madly loved.
What to do, in thjs extremity~ he knew not. As he
chafed her brow and temples and hands, he covered them
with kisses, as if they would restore t~ life. He began to
think, and thought rapidly. "Must I leave her and try
- to rescue her companion, or does it behoove me to remain
by her side, and seek lici' resuscitation alone? Of what
'more use could he be to her; and another life might be
ebbing away? She might be already dead, and that
other one might be saved?" And thell he asked himself,
whether, in preserving two lives, he might not atone for
the past?
There was but a momentary struggle. Out in the
water a fellow-being was wrestling with death. Laying
the body of the won~an, he held so lovingly to his heart,
where the sharp 'moonbeai might not glare too fiercely
in the half-closed eyes, he tore himself away. and again
plunged boldly into the dark waters, striking out for the
heavy figure that twice had come up in the sheen of light
that silvered their bosom. For awhile his efforts were
fruitless. No eddying circle betrayed the fatal locality of
the perishing fellow-being. He strained his eyes in vain
over the glittering expanse, and his features were dis-
* touted from the pain of keen disappointment. He W&amp;s
~bout to abandon the search as hopeless, and, raising his
voice, cried out in the silent air of the night,. when a fig-
ure bounded up like a cork to the surface, a short dis.
tanco to the right of him, and revealed the shape of a
man. A vigorous swimmer, he soon reached the spot,
a~d ~lutchfng the drowning man by the hair, directed his

course for the shore. But the current was strong an4 
swift, and breasting across it would have been hard
work, even when unencumbered; it was doubly difficult
with the hindrance to ~ich he was subjected, while the
branches of the trees that drooped and laved themselves
in the water were 53 interlaced as to form an almost im~
penetrable net-work. Tq go farther down the stream
would have been running a greater risk, while to go up
it with the heavy weight he bore, would have been im-
possible. Meanwhile Maud might be dying or quite
dead, with only the sky and the moon and the stars look-
ing on, and the quiet night-air catching her last sigh.
Urged by. this thought he struggled bravely with the
waves. Strong as he was, he felt that his strength
was failing rapidly, and the fear of becoming exhausted
rendered him almost powerless. At length, however,
after many and repeated efforts, his struggles were re-
warded with success, and reached the shore with his
burden.

They were a short distance below where~Maud lay, and
D'Estaing begrudged the little service rendered th~
almost dead man before him, because it forced an absence
from her. holding the unfortunate man up, the water
streamed from his ears, nose, and mouth, and for the first
time the horrid dread seized him that life might be so
nearly extinct as to render resuscitation impossible, and
perhaps Maud was also dying or dead. "What must I
do?" he cried in agony. He bad no restoratives about /
him, nor did he think that another human being was
within hearing. "One might as well be buried in a wil $
derness," thought he, "or lost in the jungles of i~di~."
And &amp;till he reflected hopelessly, and still the unf~t~M~.

laid him gently down and returned to Maud. He had
been absent but a few, moments, but they seemed to him
an age; and hi~ conscience groaned in accusation foi
neglecting her a single moment for any one else.
Taking her in his arms he covered her pale face with
kisses.
"Maud! Maud, deai~est," he cried, "open your eyes and
speak to me!"
With the quick eye of lo~ve he thought he discovered
the faintest pulsation in the temple, and pressing his
fingers upon it, a thrill of joy shot through his heart, as
his hopes were verified; and he lifted her up in the moon~
light and looked down upon her blanched face. "Maud!
~iaud 1" he called again in tender but beseeching ac~
eents~ He shook her gently. A moment more of sus~

from sleep, and she opened her eyes full upon ~the face of

looked around in a bewildered manner, and turning to the
water, shuddered and fell back.
"Maud, darling, why do you shrink from me?"

suspense to D'Estaing was ended. flaising herself slowly
up, she looked at him in a bewildered and pitiably help
less manner.
Supporting her in his arms, he whispered, "Maud,'
how h~s all this been brought about? Oh that I might
always have the privilege of thus sheltering you beside xxty
heart."
With the little strength left at command, she disen'
gaged herself from his embrace, and replied,
"I must not listen to you, Mr. ]YEstaing~ I am a
wife!" then crawling a short distance from him, she fell
from exhaustion, and gr~velling upon the earth, sobbed in
the agony of an aching heart.
"Ah, do I not know that to my sorrow?" was the pas..
sionate declaration breathed in her ear, as he lifted hei
trembling form and clasped her to his bosom. "But
you are mine, Maud, by a right stronger than any bond
of man, by a love I cannot and would~not control. You
are mine, in the sight of Heaven."
"Spare me!" she cried with quivering lips.. "Go and
leave me, I beseech you, unless you would make me for~
feit my honor."
"And going would not abate my love, Maud," lie
whispered.
"Why did you not let me die in the waters'
sobbecL.
"1 wished you to live to bless me with your love," he
selfishly answered.
Taxing her strength to the utmost, she lifted herself from
his embrace, and cried with vehemence, "To curse you,
rather. What can this love be but a curse to both of u&amp; ~f,


The                TnE
In lives such as ours the dream-tree would grow on
the borders of blades."
"hell itself, Maud, would be. heaven,, if your love could
follow rue there," he said under his breath.
"For heaven's sake!" she cried, "do not talk so reck.
lessly. , Even now I feet the curse of God is testing upon
both of us." Then, as if a sudden recollection had swept
away all thought of the present, she asked with trembling
eagerness,
"Where is Captain Beall? Did you let him perish?"
"There!" said ID'Estaing, pointing to where he lay.
"Drowned?" she cried, shading her face with her cold
hands.
"Great God! I fear so!" he answered, as he led the
way to the spot where Beall was lying.
Kneeling beside him, they both felt in vain for any
sign of life. There was none. The bounding heart was
stilled forever. lIe was even then stiff and cold. This
fact flashed first across the mind of D'Estaing; but it did
not seem to reach Maud's comprehension.
"What is to~ be done?" she said imploringly.
"Heaven only knows," he answered, "unless you can
watch here while I go to the island for assistance. It is
not more than a mile, and Ii can soon swim it."
"Watch here alone?" she asked, with a shudder creep-
ing ovei her and a vague sense of the real situation.
"I hate to ask it, my darling," lie said tenderly, kneel-
ing beside her and taking her hands in his; "hut poor
Beall is already dead, and his body must have some atten
tion."
"Do not leave me!" she cried, like a terroi'-strickera

child. "I cannot remain here alone. They will surely
come in search of us."
"As you say, then," he returned, taking hei' head on
his bosom and stroking her wet haii'. "I would Ie~u1d ~
never be compelled to leave you." And thus, in the delh'.
hun of sin, they told their love beside the dead.
Alreac~y their brows were wreathed with cypress, and
the altar xvhereo~i they placed their idol was bathed in
tears. "Tears from the depths of a divine despair," a'hun~
gem that lived ir~ their hearts. Could they not see "the
hand-writing on the wall ?"
There had been two declarations followed by two
deaths. Was it the funeral of their hopes-the guilty
shadow of their crime that thus tracked them, clad in
sombre weeds of mourning. Alas! the trail of the ser-
pent followed them, and they xvalked blindly to the end.
It was a picture worthy of Rembrandt, with its ghastlp~
lio'hts and shadows, as these two wretched beings sat in
depths of the forest, silently watching beside the still
form of the sleeper, sleeping "the sleep that knows n.o
waking." T he water lapsed and moaned and gurgled as
V the wind tossed the waves; the long gray moss sighed and
whispered in the night breeze; the moonbeams shim~
mncred timidly through the overhanging boughs of the
trees; the shrill cry of the curlews name up like grief~
notes for the dead, arid divided the sounds that broke the
awful stillness of the night, with Maud's heart-wrung
sighs and tears. The night advanced, but no relief came;
and, like two guilty spectres, they sat still and silent in the
alternate lights and shadows.
"flow selfish I am!" Mand exclaimed at last. "Foi

Heaven's sake, go at once, and bring some one to take
care of my poor friend."'
"It is too late now," said ID'Estaing. "I shall not leave
you here alone, so we must take the consequences."
Drawing close to the dead body, she stroked the white
~forehead and placed her slender hand on the mute hips.
"So cold and still I" she murmured. "Who could have
thought of this, this morning. Oh, what a miserable
wretch I am!"
Just then a shout rang out, clearly and distinctly, upon
the midnight air. They both sprang to their feet, and
their hearts beat' with gratitude as D'Estaiig responded.
They knew that help was at hand. Still another and an~
other greeting was exchano'ed until all the woods re.
verberated with the 'welcome sounds.
Soon a boat came in sight as it glided gracefully
around a curve, and a party of friends, having stepped
ashore, were congratulating Maud upon her~~ safety. But'
their joy was instantly changed to sorrow. Beall was a
great favorite, and as they beheld him sti~etclied in the cold
calm of death, their laughter was turned into mourning.
In as few words as possible D'Estaimig 'related the story
of the sad disaster. Tenderly they lifted and laid his r&amp;
mains jn the boat, and silently taking their seats, floated
over the moonlighted waters to the island. They soon
came in sight, and the whole expectant party who were
standing on the shore greeted them with waving hand.
kemThiefs and loud hurrahs. But soon the rejoicing was
changed to weeping, anid humbled before the awful dis~
sensation of Providence they rePirned to the 6ity, wiser,
perhaps better, for the terrible lesson of the feeble tenure
which is held upon life.

CHAPTER XXIY.
A LETTER.
BOUT a week after the picnic, a small company
were as mbled one evening at the residence' of
Colonel rtridge. iMlaud was playing for them
to dance, while D'Estaing, who never indulged in this in~
nocent amusement, stood near, twirling the tassel of a fan,
and stealing furtive glances at the beautiful profile of the
performer.
Finally his protracted silence became embarrassing, and
although it was a moment of ecstasy, Maud said, under
her breath,
"Why don't you talk?"
2l3ending gracefully over her he whispered softly,
"Ian~ ~oo haypy."
His face was radiant, and her glorious eyes sank be~
neath his buining gaze, while her cheeks flushed crimson.
After a few moments of pretty confusion, Maud looked
up and said,
"Do you like to receive letters?"
"I think it is one of the greatest pleasures in life-.that
is, it must be."
"iMlust be?"
"Yes, to those who have dear ones to write to them."
"Really~then, have you no loved ones with whom you
correspond?"'
"Not a human being," he said sadly.
"Suppose I should Write to you?"
"Do not tantalize me."


100            A LETE.

"Nothing is further from my thoughts. But what
would you think, should Ii write you?"
"Did it contain what my heart is dying for, I should
be, of all men, the most happy. I can scarcely be more
wretched thaii I am, no matter what were its contents. It
would require but two little words to consummate my
joy or seal my woe."
"What are they?"
"Pope."
"And the other?"
"Foro'et"
Quickly slipping from her belt a piece of paper closely
folded, she laid it, upon the keys of the instrument, and
looking up at him said,
"it is yours."
The act was so adroitly performed as not to attract at~
tension, and pressing the note to his lips, a moment after.
ward, D'Estaing said,
"Does it contain either of the two words?"
"Edo not know-don't, ask me-but leave me now, 1
beseech you. This effort is too much, and I am ready to
sink to the floor."
"Your humblest desire is my greatest pleasure. Good~
night."
They exchanged a hasty, but meaning glance, and mak-.,
ing his exit through a side door, he disappeared without
being observed or missed by the gay dancers. Rushing
madly along the streets, he soon gained his room, and
tearing open the letter, read the following:
"That this qff~air, which was revealed to us by the
~nerest accident, must end, you will readily appreciate~

tare as casual friends. You are a strpng man, i but a
weak woman; and I demand your assistance in the pem
forinance of my duty elsewhere. Let all things be as for
merly, or else, Ii must implore you to fly, to leave me-to
go-to put oceans and seas between us,---to forget me--to
bury me in oblivion, while my prayers and tears shall ac~
company you.
In agony,
D'Estaing read the letter time and again, until every
word seemed branded in his heart. He pressed it to hi~
lips, then walked the floor, and the more he thought on
the impossibility of ever making the loved one his, the
mote intense grew his passion-the wilder his despair.
Then lie would reason with himself, and vow that he
would think of her no more-that he' would forget her,
and yielding to her request, leave the country and return
to his old life of roaming. But what reason or philosophy
has ever stood the test of a great, strong passion? All
theories a~re shaken by it, even as the monarchs of the
forest are riven by the whirlwind. W1~at pledges have
not been dissipated in its elysian dreams, even as the mist
is dissolved before the rising sun? So it was with D'Es~
taing! Life had dawned anew, and the world, which for
years' had held nothing for him but wretchedness, sud'
denly became resplendent with incQnceivable ecstasy
A)e all-powerful and uncontrollable passion which had  N
hiken such violent possession of his soul tinged all things  7
with noonday splendor, and he sighed heavily as asking
himself if he should so soon relinquish the treasur6w~l~ieb

he h~d just found. Opening the window and gazing out
into the calm, still night, lie fancied the moon shimmered
with more softened rays and that the "twinkling stars were
Ianghing," as if to congratulate him upon his new-foimd
bliss. He leaned out of the window, and as the night air
fanned his heated brow, revelled in delicious dreams. But
only for a little while did he bask in these ecstatic fancies,
for soon he thought, "What madness-what folly for me
to love this woman. It might have been, 'but not now.
What misery in the thought. No-her position must not
be sacrificed-her honor is sacred, and, by the powers
above, I will protect it with my latest breath. 1 must
leave her. IL will quit the country and return to my old
life of wandering and homelessness." Then the tempter
would whisper, "Why should I? heaven knows, my
life has had few pleasures enough, andwhymaylnoten
joy those so bewitchingly held out to me now? Why may
I not love and be beloved?"
These delusive fantasies were almost instantly dispelled
though, and in the next moment he was saying,
"Am IL a man of honor? her husband my best friend?
What perfidy! I will ciusli these feelings from out my
heart, if they cost me my life." And thus did the day.
dawn find him struggling with the passion which threa~
ened to engulf him in the whirlpool of its ma~ilstroin.

CHAPTER XXV.
IN THE DEPTHS.
/ S IMlaud sat alone, the next evening, in the win.
dow of the conservatory that opened on the en~
trance, these words of Byron came into her
mind:
"Oh, love! what is it in this world of ours
Which makes it fatal to be loved? Ah, why,
With cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers,
And made thy best interpreter a sigh?"
Thus, mentally soliloquizing, she thought on the b~'il~
liant and erratic genius who penned these lines, and won~
dered what exquisite torture had induced them. Then,
plucking a cluster of flowers, and pinning them in her
aorsage, as some dim-remembered song, the remaining
lines sprang to her lips, and she said half-aloud,
"As those who dote on odors pluck the flowers,
And place them oz~ their breast-but place to die-..
Thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish
Are laid within our bosoms but to perish."
Yes! even as quickly as the perfume of flowers passes
away will that love die which fancy paints eternal But
who believes it?
Does a day of change, of neglect, ~nd of coldness, ever
dim the rainbow-tinted dreams of those who revel in the~
fairy domains of love? Ah, no! each one considers him.

'What though despair and hopelessness were mingled
with iMlaud's guilty love, no cruel thought suggested even
the possibility of a change, as sitting~, in the gloaming,
with the evening breeze lightly kissing her brow, she
wondered if it bore to her the sighs of some other be~
ing as wretched as herself. Then, as she watched the
staid's peep forth one by one, and s~w them twinkle so
Therrily, she wondered again if misery was known in
those far-off realms that looked so bright? Then she
thought on the inconsistencies of life. I' Our life is two.
fold," says Byron; but he refers only to the hours of wak~
ing and sleeping. Is it not rather two-fold when wake
ing, or as. that fascinating writer, Owen Meredith, cx.
presses it,
"Stilt, as once with the actors in Greece, 'tis the case,
Each must speak to the crowd with a mask on his face."
How true this is, fQr who carries his heart in his face
for the vulgar gaze of the public, and how little do men
know of eaeh other.
It is often true that those who are most envied, and
w~o are apparently the gayest of the gay, are but masked
pieces of wretchedness.- There is but one eye, though,
that can penetrate the hidden cavernS of the human
heart, and read what is written there, as there. is but one
T3eiug who can change w ailing into songs of joy.
The world said, Maud had everything to be envied for
-a good husband, a home of luxury, friends by the
legion, youth, beauty, and accomplishments. 'What more
could be desired?
How little did they know that all this failed to answer
the demands of a heart that ~4~:dying to be loved. how

little did they dream that she arose from the feast hungry,
and departed from the wine-table thirsty.
While silently indulging these sad musings the death~
like quiet that reigned was broken by the gentle fall of
footsteps. They were not hurried, like those that bear
glad tidings, but were slow and measured, like those that
follow in some funeral train.
Maud shuddered with ill-defined fears, then trembled
with a kind of painful joy, as ID'E~taing stood before her;
for she felt that those were his footsteps even when he
himself was invisible. His manner was hurried and ex-
cited, while she looked as though chiseled ouf of marble;
but beneath that cold exterior burned a living fire, which
would only be quenched in death.
"Good-evening," he said softly, and, lifting his hat
gracefully, seated himself on a step at her feet.
She did not speak, b~it only smiled and extended the
tips of her fingers, which he warmly grasped, as he tossed
into her lap what seemed to be a letter, although it bore
no superscription.
As she eagerly seized it, he said hurriedly, "In those
pages you will find something like a reply to the letter
you gave me last evening. Promise me that you will an-
swer it, and that you will not keep me in suspense."
11cr heart was throbbing m adly, but her voice betrayed
no emotion, as she saul,
"I promise."
For a few minutes there was silence, then springing up,
.D'Estaing said, "Adie~t.f"
Their hand3 were clasped as if never to part, and in a
voice tremulous with suppressed emotion, Mau&amp; said,
"Will you ~ot remain t&amp; tea?"

attempt to eat, seated by your side, i~ a mockery I do not'

Still clasping her hand, the storm which raged in
heart broke forth in a torrent as he said,
"My l9ve fills heart and soul and engrosses every ~
thought. L~It is the ruling passion of my life-it is misery
to be separated fro you, and it is torture t~4e with you.

"Would you have the fate of a criminal linked witfr
yours?" sounded harshly in the deepening twilight. 'iI~
"You would be ~no more criminal then than nowV"
and Maud's sensltA~e nature fancied that there was ~a
covert sneer beneath these words of passion. Stung to
the quick, she jerked her hand from his clasp which was
almost painful, and saying, "It is well your words recall
me to a sense of propriety, and remind me that I must
not listen to you," without another word she quickly
entered the house, while he walked slowly away
Locked within he~ chamber, she st6od beneath the gas-
light a few moment~ afterward, reading the following:
"Could I unbosom all that which now burns and thrill~
within me, you would then know how deeply, how devo-
tedly, and how entirely I love you.{ Could I but lay bare
my heart, that you might' see its every pulsation, you

this as you do, it~ sounds strangely when you. urge me to

to the future; change and clouds will come soon enough.
Why hasten them? You are mine by that invisible
power which scorns conventionalities and unites hearts
in bonds that cannot be sundered. A love as pure and un*
defiled as ours might call forth the approbatiQn of even
the angels in heaven. It is not of our making, and has
none of the taint or drQss of earth in it, and yet you
talk of parting. Recall those cruel words, and write me,
if but one word, to bid me koy~.
"Only yo~u~rs,
When she had finished reading, the letter was blotted
and stained with tears, and still the torrent ixured, as if
that would ease her bursting heart.
To hope, was sin-to love, was crime; none knew this
better than Maud, and without acknowledging it to her~
self, she did both.
She felt that she was a treacherous wife in thought, if
not in deed, and her heart ached with conflicting emotions.
Realizing at length that the indulgence of grief is a'
luxury not to be enjoyed by the guilty with impunity, she
joined the gay party below, only to find the evening in.
terminally long and weary.

OTIAPTER XXVI.

"The stars above were brightly shining,
Because they'd nothing else to do."

OAPUOIIIN preached one day on the marvels of
nature. "My brethren," he said, "you wonder
at many things, while others that are by far more
Important seem not to affect you. at all. Thus, for in-
stance, you admire the sun, and appreciate the moon very
little; and yet the latter sheds her rays dyer you when
the darkness of night would fright en you, while the sun
r shines only in the broad daylight." When Madame de
Sta~l heard this anecdote, she exclaimed, "The Capuchin
was a ~avi~nt. We ought to have made him -acquainted
with Buffon."
On the, night in question the stars twinkled as merrily,
the moon shoi~ as calmly, the sky was as cloudless, as if
hunger ~nd poverty, crime and murder, sin and death, did
;~ ziot stalk abroad over this beautiful earth.

On this same evening, in a chamber where there was
no light save the straggling moonbeams which.forced an
entrance uninvited, D'Estaing sat gazing yearningly

"TIlE STARS ABOVE WERE BRIGhTLY ShINING."
to iuifold their bright pages, and read therein his destiny.
Long and silent he sat there, and the mental soliloquy
in which he indulged, ran thus:
"She is going away, and without the slightest intima-
tion or one word of parting. Well! let her go. She is
like all the rest, fair and false, arid II will endeavor to forget
her as she has forgotten me. I will pluck her image
from my heart though it cost me my life. Who talks of
forgetting ~ Alas, it is easy to talk, but how difficult to
erase from the memory those forms which are branded
on the heart! I have not been near her, but Heaven
knows it was for her sake, not mine; for did I consult
my own feelings, I should be by her side eternally."
Then, ~vith fresh regret, he said, "Why has this pew-found
bliss been born to me but to perish? Why could I not
have gone on in the same loneliness without knowing
that there could exist for me a brighter day? I know
that the indulgence of this passion is incompatible with
my ideas of honor, but why talk of love and honor?
Suppose even Aristides and Cupid were weighed in the
same scales, who doubts but they would lean to the side
of the latter? But still, as a man claiming to understand
thoroughly the code of moral ethics, I hate myself for not
crushing these feelings, as I would smother the flame
kindled by the midnight incendiary~ II must see her
once more; and then-~and then- But the future
must take care of itself."
Springing up, he followed the direction of his thoughts,
a short walk brought him to the desired haven, whe~
the well-known sounds of Beethoven's "MQonli~ht" ien-
dered by a master-hand, greeted his soul with delight1

With pleasure rather beaming from her eyes than ex~

Pressing the small white hand which still rested con
Iidingly in his, he said,
"Pray go~on with your music, as I fear it will be a
long time before I shall have the pleasure of hearing you
scram."
With an astonished air, she said,
"Why do you say so? Does the accomplished editor
of the Times contemplate an absence from the city?"
"If your description refers to rnys~lf, I do not intend
the city; but I have heard that you did."

Why, this is very strange! I heard you expected to

"Oh! Well, Colonel Hartridge and the girls are
going, and I was to have- gone with them, but have aban-
doned the trip. So I hope it will be a long time before
you have occasion to pay your adieux to me."
"God grant it!" he said with so much earnestness,
that the tell-tale blushes crimsoned INland's cheeks.
"Wait until I start for Europe, or become a voluntary
exile, or an inmate of some convent, or a lone wanderer
in the deserts of Arabia,' or a weary pilgrim dragging my
aching feet toward Mecca,---then you may say 'good.

fraught with so mudi pain?"

"And who may that one be?" she asked, in a coquet.
Lish manner that was entirely foreign to her.
It is said that every woman has a spice of coquetry iii
her nature; but perhaps what is known as that feeling
may be only a great desire to be doubly assured of that
love and sympathy whhh are so necessary to her happi-
ness. Naturally enough, D'Estaing had fallen into this
erroneous impression, which exists in the world, and ~he
was a little piqued, as he said:
"Ask your own heart."
"And what if that should not answer truly?" she
answered, in a spirit of merriment.
"A woman's heart, when in converse with itself, and
no eye save that of God beholds it, will answer truly..
No matter how false it may be to the world,~ it has its
honest hour, like that which comes to men when they are
dying. At such an hour, I bid you answer my question."
INlaud had become rather restive under thi~ solemn
rebuke, but, with a feminine determination not to yield
an iota, asked, with apparent frivolity:
~ And what about mejn's hearts?"
He looked at her closely for a moment, to see, if possi~
ble, whether she were only jesting, or whether she was in
earnest~; then, in a wounded tone, said:
"If you knew how this trifling grated upon a heart
that' is already tortured beyond description, you would
cease your taunts. - But how can a woman, whose highest
ambition is to outnumber her sisters in victims, be ex-
pected to know anything of mercy!"
"She cannot know anything of it, because it is a
Divine attribute; and of course, if we are the fiends you
put Us, we must be strangers to this beautiful vi~ttie."


V

ID'Estaing had arisen, and stood before her, with ii
nation flashing from his eyes. for, at the moment, h~
believed her to be as false as she was fair. What great
injustice he did her, those alone know who can penetrate
the hidden recesses of her heart, and see with what
idolatry she worshipped him. her pride asked, what
right he had to arraign her in such a manner for a few
idle words; and as she sat there, feigning the indifference
she did not feel, it was to see
"How light a cause may move
Dissension be~weex~ Iwarts that love."
No ready reply sprang to her lips, and, after a few
moments of pair~ful silence, iD'Estaing said "good even~
ing," and, without awaiting an answer, quietly left~ the
house.
Maud sprang up, and the great desire of her heart was
to rush after him-to bring him back-to crouch at his
feet and implore his pardon. But no; it would never do
p      to follow him, for women are bound down like slaves to
the conventionalities of society; and, sinking down in
wretchedness, she thought she too would go away on the
morrow, and never, never see him again.

her transgression? These questions were asked time and,

That there was some mystery surrounding his life, the

"Ah, how I could worship such a man as Tricotrin!"

forced the conviction upon her, that this guilty 'love could
be nothing but a curse to both. To check a tornado in
its fury would be as easy as to recede now; and, in the
silence of that hour, she felt that the warnings which
were whispered in her ears came too late. During the
short interval that these thoughts filled he~Vmind, D'Es~.

looking up, and as if urged by some inv~ible power, he
said,

~iated with a gentle sister, and a co4sin whom I always
regarded as a brother. We were the ;last surviving mem-
bers of an old and aristocratic house our ancestors hav~
ing emigrated to this country when Louisiana owed alle-
giance to the French Government. Consumption was
hereditary in both families, and few of them ever attained
even the full maturity of years. Thus, Gustave T~ela~

of six years, 'and we three orphans, who were the last

New Orleans at that time, where we wei~e all born and
partially reared. Gustave was my junior by two years,
Marie being still younger; they were thrown much more
together, and it was but natural that this love, which they
felt for each~ other in childhood, should ripen into some-
thing warmer as the years advanced. I hailed this state
of affair's with delight for our houses. had always inter-
married; and to have the two remaining branches united
was al~nost more than I could have hoped for. Gustave
always called her his 'little wife' when they were at.
play; and Marie blushingly declared he. was to be her
'husband when they grew to be big.' Well, the years
flew by on golden wings, and soon we had crossed the
Atlantic, according to our father's desires, where Gustave
and myself were placed at school in Germany, and Marie
was sent to Paris. If young hearts were ever torn with

impulsive, and generous to a fault, but the soul of honor~
I firmly believed. His frank, open nature, made him ten
friends where I had not one, and he was the acknowl-
edged favorite of the school. He was quick and b~ril-

much, more assiduously. B~t the three years here were~

now, after a season in Paris, we were to return to 'Home,
sweet home!' So, to Paris we went, where our delight
at seeing Marie again exceeded all bounds, and Gustave
danced for very joy, while I pressed her to my 'heart and'
kissed her time and again. She was wonderfully devel-
oped, and, I thought, the loveliest woman I had. ever seen.
She was grace itself, and in her manners combined the
intensity of the Spanish with the vivacity of the French;
and I did not think it an exaggeration whcn Gustave pro-
nounced her perfect. She seemed the world to him, and
for a short time all went as merry as a marriage-bell. It
was not to be wondered at that Gustave, with his impul-
sive nature, which had always been unchecked,'~"should
plunge into every species of gayety and dissipation with
all the excess of a novice. Marie implored me with tear-
ful eyes to remonstrate with him; ~but II did not do it, for
I thought he was only 'sowing his wild oats,' and would
soon return to a more settled life. Instead of improving,
matters grew worse day by day; all attempts to reclaim,
or even influence him, were ineffectual, and at length the
painful trath was forced upon me, that he was 'joined to
his idols.' When Marie interceded, it only chafed, and
made him ify to new excesses in which to drown his re-
morse; while she-poor gii4 1-was wild with grief. She
had not left the boarding-school of Madame F , and
much subsequent suffering might have been spared her,
which resulted from this change. Our guardian, not
beii~g able 'to remain abroad, had confided her to the care
of a Mr. and Mrs. Duponte, so. soon as her term at school
should expire. Although unknown to us, they were
'acquaintances of his, and residents of New Orleans, but
+ had been passing some years in Paris. Madame I)w

ponte had called, and Marie had spent several evenings
with her; but the innocent child never suspected that the
devil lurked beneath the glare and glitter of that brilliant
hotel. They soon discovered and sought Gustave, as they
did almost every American who arrived; an
repaired thither with Marie, greatly to our surprise, we
found him on terms of intimacy with them, and appa-
rently as much, at home as a member of the family.
With what horror do I recall those people! for it was to
their machinations, more than to all other causes com~
bined, that Gustave owed his ruin and death; thaf Marie,:
sank into an untimely grave; and that I am now an out-
cast and a wanderer. It was there that the wine-cup was
temptingly held out by female hands; it was there that
the most brilliant 8aldn, which was no better than the
lowest gambling-den in Paris, was presided over by fasci.
noting women. Start not, for, as there ~s a God in heav-
en, I speak but the truth. Monsieur iDuponte was whatI
called a professional gambler; but the world (?) said ho
was a very nice old gentleman, who enjoyed a quiet game
at home, rather than seek it in haunts of vice.. That lie
had his games at home, hundreds of agonized hearts can
testify; and it makes the blood c~ir4le in my veins, to.
think of the bright hopes that went down in midnight
darkness around that board, until, ruined beyond redemp-
tion, they died in some gutter, or filled a felon~~ grave.
But weep for your sex-pray for your sex-when I tell
you that that man's wife and only daughter were his
ready. accomplices, his m6st fascinating assistants in hi~
hellish schemes. From their lips Gustave heard that
Marie's pure love was too exacting; and from them lie
also learned that the restraints she would have thrown

around him were a prisoner's chains, which would allow
him no freedom or enjoyment. Occasionally, however,
he would relent, and for days be the most constant and
devoted lover. At such times Marie's face would beam
with the radiant happiness she felt, as they talked of theli
* far-off home and contemplated marriage. If we could
have then withdrawn him from those evil associations, I
firmly believe that, to-day, we might be a happy and
united family, inst ~ad of two dead, and the other living a
life of mysterious loneliness. But these seasons of ha~
~iness were of short duration, and, the moment those
female monsters would discover that Gustave had re~
turned to his allegiance, they would put forth renewed
efforts, and this infatuated boy would again fall a victim
to their fiendish designs. i Their profession required that
they should be well-read in the book of human nature;
and comprehending from the first that I was no tool foi
them, they left me alone. Not belonging to the set of
fast men who made their house a rendezvous, and seeing
very little of the family, ~it is not surprising that I was in
almost total ignorance of what transpired beneath that
roof. As for Marie-poor, deluded girl !-I verily be-
lieve she would have gone to the brink of hell itself to
have remained near Gustave; and so her lips were sealed,
until it was too late. Thus three months passed misera-
bly away, and the time drew near for us to turn our faces
homeward. I still hoped and prayed that, for Marie's
sake, his own honor, and the happiness of us all, Gustave
would turn from the error of his way, and reform. But,
alas! how idle were such hopes, the melancholy end ivill
testify. All this time I walked as one in a dream-..~as a
soixiflainbulist, who, having his eyes open, sees not; for I

failed to notice the paling cheek and drooping forn of
my preciouS sister, r the hectic flush that came and went,
until the first h~merrhage filled me with horror. Neither
did I know that Gustave was a bankrupt, until a letter'
from our guardian informed me that he had honored hk
drafts to the extent of his fortune. I cared nothing fo~
this, as Marie and myself were both wealthy, and I
thought perhaps an offer of a large sum might induce
him to abandon his life of depravity, and tempt him tc
return to the paths of virtue and rectitude. For a time
my plan succeeded admhably, and my heart beat high
with hope, when we arranged an early day on which to
leave for home. But who can depict my despair, when Ii
knew that the last dollar of the sum advanced had gone,
like the rest, fbr gambling-debts and the most revolting
debaucheries! I 110W determined to take Marie home,
cost what it would. But no sooner had we decided to go,
than the Dupontes declared their determination to follow
suit. So, arriving at Ilavre together, we all took passage
in the same vessel, and no words can describe the imupa-
Pence I felt to reach my n~tiv~ land once more; for then
I was resolved to break loose from our evil companions
foi ever, and place Marie beyond the pale of their perse~
cautions. The IDupontes, as well as Marie, were ignorant
of Gustave's losses, and thd crafty mother and father had
no idea of losing sight of one whom they expected to
inveigle into a marriage with their daughter Elise.
"Life on board ship was but a repetition of that in
Paris; and, while Gustave was all attention to his new
love, my poor sister drooped and faded, until it wrung my
heart with agony to see her. A blow from th~ north-east
gave her a severe cold and cough, and the ~eeond h~mor

and attention-as well they might have been, for they
were killing her. F or a day or two Gustave was all devo.
tion, and Marie rallied so nuder these small crumbs from
his traitorous hand that she was apparently well. She
even allowed him to take her on deck, and declared that
she never felt better. But Fate seemed inexorable, and
when we reached New York, she seen'~ed more dead than
alive.
"Upon his return to America, Mr. Barri~re had settled
in New York, leaving his partner in New Orleans; so
that, upon our arrival, we were welcomed to his palatial
residence on Madison Avenue, with the same cordiality
as if we had been his own children. They supplied the
places of the fondest parents to my darling sister, and
everything was done for her that the warmest affection
could suggest. Alas! she was to be a martyr to a false
infatuation, and no love or skill could save her, for her
days were numbered. Of course, I thought th? Dupontes
would return to the Crescent City, and that we should~ be
effectually rid of them; but, to my surprise and horror,
they opened an establishment on Fifth Avenue, similar to~
the one kept in Paris, which was frequented by fast me1~
and women of doubtful reputation. Mr. Barri~re ~id
myself made one last, final, effort to reclaim the erring
one, and not without effect. Our kind guardian even
touched upon a subject which I could not broach: it was
my sister's declining health; and he asked him if he did
not think his conduct heartless as well as dishonorable.
The boy's heart was ever kind, and, being touched now if
rear earnest, he pledged his sacred word and honor to
break forever with his evil habits and associations, and

we had the indescribable pleasure of seeing him return
to his first love-in gemuiuc penitence, as we thought.
"The happiness of those days cannot be imagined, and
Marie-poor, tender flower !-basked once more in the
love and smiles of him who seemed indispensable to her
being. She rallThd so as to be able to go out driving with
him, and the ensuing month was replete with as pure and
unalloyed bliss as ever falls to the lot bf mortals.
"J~ust at this time it was currently reported that Gus-
tave was soon to be married to Mademoiselle Elise Du~
poute. I heard it, and, being asked several times if it.
was true, of course indignantly denied such a charge.
Mr. and Mrs. Barri~r~ gave themselves great concern
about the report, and were pained lest it should reach
Marie. Considering it one of those idle tales which
readily find credence amongst a class whose sole aim in
life is to detract from their fellow-men, IL gave it no atten~
tion, or I should then and there have ferreted out the
whole matter. Business connected with our estates call
ing me to New Orleans, I went with the happiest heart I
had knowii for many a day.
"When kissing Marie 'good-by,' and confiding her to
the care of Gustave, no misgivings entered my thoughts,
for I expected to return at the expiration of a few weeks,
and find him unchanged. But, alas!. to show what
little confidence can be placed in human vows, within
one brief hour after my departure, he returned, with
a vigor which was increased by a short abstinence, to
his old haunts and habits. Three days elapsed, ~aud
Marie saw him not; then six went by; then ten-and
still he came not. The intense anxiety and excitement
caused by this cruel suspense brought on h~en2iorrhage

after ha~rnorrhage, and Mr. Barri~re interceded with Gus
tave but to be insulted. Fresh rumors were afloat in
regard to his approaching marriage with. Miss iDuponte,
and the kind public even went so far as to name an early
day for the nuptials.
"Throuo'hthegossipping tongues of malicious friends Q~
and servants, these reports reached Marie, and when Gus-
tave came not, her life was jeopardized by the torture
which racked her heart. An unexpected telegram brought
me quickly back but to clasp her in my arms once more
-but once again to 'kiss those lips which were soon cold
and #silent in death. Her last words were, 'Brother---
Gustave-Gustave! Oh, how I love you! Come-
nearer-Gustave!' and with superhuman strength she

loved one greeted not the vacant stare which sought him,
neither did he hear the dying accents which lisped his
name,. for he was donning his wedding-suit. A death-
groan was the only evidence we had of her disappoint-
ment; and, as she fell back in exhaustion, a stream of
fresh blood gurgled forth which drenched us both. The
struggle was then soon over, for, without a murmur, she
breathed her last as I bent anxiously over her."

forced to stop here, and, burying his face in his hands, lie
wept as bitter tears as ever caine from human eyes.. 1-us

flowed, too, for . this sister in sorrow, who loved "not
wisely, but too well."
Their low sobs filled the room, and some little time
elapsed, when, turning to Maud, ID'Estaing said ex
citodly:

A MIDNIGHT REVELATION.       i8~

"Do you wonder that I left the house a madman, and
that revenge had taken possession of me, heart, minds
and soul? I entered in that house a loving brother; I~
caine out of it a fiend.
"But time was precious, for the villain, was to b~ mar~
ned at nine o'clock, and it was now after eight. SQ~,kiss~
ing my murdered angel a thousand farewells, V flew,
rather than walked, along the streets, for 'l4iad a long
account to settle with this worse than Cain, and I felt as
if II should die unless it were done speedily. It was a fit
night-was it not ?-to avenge the death of his murdered
bride. I sought him at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, where
he had lived since his desertion of us, but was informed
that he had just gone with his bridal party to the Thi-
pontes. 'Then the rumor is true,' I said, for until that
moment I had not believed it; and as I turned hastily
away, I wondered that tlNwrath of God did not strike
him dead. It was but a short distance to the residence~
of the Dupontes, and rushing madly along the street, I
soon gained the desired haven. The house was brUliantl~
illuminated, and the street was almost entirely blockaded
with equipages; but darting through the crowded way, I '~
soon gained the entrance, where the merry voices and gay
laughter within grated hamhly upon my bleeding heart.
The service was to take place at the famous cathedral in
Twenty-eighth street; and while I stood as one palsied,
with no del4ied plan in my mind, two or three of the
bridal couples passed out and sought their respective car-
riages. At length the object of my search made his
appearance, when, quick as lightning, I sprang from my
hiding-place, seized him by the throat, draggo4 him fx'o*n

the hilt into his very heart, saying, as I did so, 'Take
this-and this-and this-for your treachery to Marie
Delamere; and know, before you die, that it is her
brother who thus avenges her wrongs!'
"it is astonishing how effective an arm can bo when
nerved by such a cause as mine, for I must have dealt
him a dozen blows before any one seemed to realize the
~ituatioII, or before any attempt was made to stay me in
my work of death. Suddenly my arm was seized, the
weapon was wrenched from my hand, and, as I released
the victim of my revenge, I had the satisfaction of see-
ing him fall dead at my feet. No groan or word escaped
him, and I wished then, and have wished ever since, that
I could there have expiated the deed by death at the
hands ~f the infuriated mob, who called loudly for
revenge. The scene that ensued can never be described,
and those only can have any conception of it who were
eye-witnesses. In the terrible confusion, some cried
'Murder!~ while others were paralyzed into silence.
The police seemed under a spell, which withheld them in
the performance of their duty;* women shrieked; the
bride fainted,, and fell upon the dead body of the groom,
and it seemed to me but a just retribution, when I beheld
her wedding-robes bedabbledx in the blood of my sister's
r~iurderer. The warm crimson stream ran at my feet,
and, looking at it, I felt somewhat avenged, as I remem-
bered it was 'blood for blood.'
"The police then approaching, I gave myself up
instantly, thus obviating the necessity of using any force.
But the set of fast young men who composed the bridal
party, being doubly maddened by the death of thefr
thief, as well as cheated out of a night's debauch, now

sought revenge in return. Collecting a mob with the
determination of hanging me, they followed us to the
jail, with cries of 'Mob him! Shoot him! ilang him!'
But not one of them being bold enough to take the lead,
their suggestions were not put into execution, an~l they
only succeeded in firing a few random shots, and throw-
ilig stoAes at me. how little did I heed the~m or their
threats! The only two who made life worth the living
were dead, and such a death, as made me wish I too was
of their silent number.
"We had now reached the gloomy portals of tlie
'Tombs,' and it was with great difficulty that the police
could force an entrance, for the mob pressed right and
left. But at length I wa~ alone in my cell; and as the
heavy door banged to, I fell upon the~ cot in utter eihaus-

consequences. The yells of the rioters outside fell un~

of even a scaffold could not have shaken off. Several
hours went by unnoticed. The moi outside had slunk~

voice which was choked with tears:
"'For your sake, and hers, who has been a mother to
me, I go. Remember, it is not because I value life, but
to spare the feelings of you and her.'
"lIe folded me in his arms as a mother might an
infant, and the tears rained down our cheeks. No word
escaped our lips, for our hearts were too full, and our
farewdl was silent. I passed the turnkey and the guard
without any difficulty, and, rushing along the streets like
some 'escaped convict who prizes his miserable life, at last
arrived at the spot designated by my kind guardian. The
man and boat were both ready and. waiting; the wind
was favorable, and, sinking upon the miniature deck, I
bade him begone, and soon we ~ia~d left New York far
behind us. My heart was bkeding at every core. I'
could not talk to my dusky companion, and after a quick

sail we landed at Nassau, without having exchanged a
dozen words. It was here that I took the nan~e of D'Es~
taing, for my real name is Delainere; and after coinmu~
nicating with Mr. Barri~re, and receiving remittances in
this feigned name, I went directly to Cuba. From there
I went to 'Spain; then to the East, where I met your
friend Moreau. Growing wear there, as everywhere, I
came to the Continent. Here, as elsewhere, everything
palled upon me. I was a stranger in a strange land; and
thus five years passed wretchedly away. A great 'longing
for the 'Sunny South' came over me. I could not resist
it; and, crossing the 'deep, blue ocean,' the fugitive'
from justice rested from his lonely wanderings, and made
his home in your midst.
"Thus I have given y~u a brief outline of my history.,
Since my arrival here, you know what my life has been,
for you have awakened those feelings which I thought
would never exist for me. You have turned the bright
page of my life outside, and made me wish to live. Now
that you know all, tell me if you can tal~e theso hands,
which are dyed with a brother's blood, in yours?"
Pressing them warmly, she looked the "yes" which
her lips refused to speak.
"And you can love me?" he asked, anxiously, while
gazing into her face.
11cr glorious eyes made answer, as in one burning
glance she betrayed the intense love which filled her
heart.
"And you are to be mine?" he whispered, as lie
pressed her to his heart and kissed her brow.
"Come, darling I If you love me, fly with me, ere it
is too late!"

At these words she drew away from him, and said,
"I must not listen to such language."
"May I not even hope that in the future you will be
mine ? "
"No-never!"
There was a mingling of pain with love in both hearts
at that moment; and as the clock told tWo, he arose,
and, pressing her to his heart once more, ~vent out into
the night; while she sank down upon th&amp; tUe-d -tUe in
untold misery.
CHAPTER XXVIII.
~~LEAF BY LEAF THE ROSES
IROWNED! Who's drowned?" And thus
the question flew from lip to lip, and loving
hearts stood still, and rosy cheeks grew pale,
and stalwart forms were shaken, and maiden eyes. were
tearful, as each thought on the, one best beloved. Only a
few days before, Fred West had called upon Maud to say
"good-by," and had offered to be the bearer of messages
or letters to the absent ones, whom he expected to join at
the fashionable sea-side resort of Long Branch. A week
lhter, as he stepped from the omnibus of the West End
hotel, he was startled by the "hurrying to and fro," and
th~ pallid chee~is of those he met, by the shrieks of
women borne to him on the passing wind, and with one
bound he sprang into the office of the hotel, and inquired'
for Miss Dean.. Upon being informed that she had gone

[

out bathing with a party of friends, his heart stood still
with fear; but that fear lent speed to his limbs, and with,
marvellous rapidity he gained the beach, where a large
crowd had already gathered. As he drew nearer, one
long, loud shriek pierced his heart, and the well-known
voice of Kate called to him, saying: "Oh, Fred! Daisy
-Daisy! Quick! quick, or it will be too late! Here-
here!" And, dragging him to the spot where they had
gone in bathing, she pointed in the direction where they
had lost sight of Daisy, and where there were already a
number of gallant men struggling with the waves in
hopes of finding the lost form. Fred, who was an expert
swimmer, soon outstripped them all; and if the silent
prayer which went up from his distracted heart could
have been framed into words, it would have been, "My
God, give me strength!'? Ere long, Daisy's gallant
champions returned pne by one to the sea-girt strand, and
a quiet shake of the head expressed more deeply than
words the despair that reigned in their hearts. One form
was still seen contending, although occasionally lost sight.
of as the foam-crested waves swept over him. Each
moment the breakers grew stronger and more frequent,
and superhuman strength alone gould have resisted the
fearful under-tow, which in its treachery had borne Daisy
away, as, for a moment, she relinquished her* pon
the rope.
Amongst the lookers-on who stood watching the tern.
ble struggle between the boyish lover and the boiling,
seething cauldron of that wide waste of waters, were
moist eyes and hearts that were throbbing with truest
syn~pathy. But alas! it was hoping against hope, and he~.
was fast expending his own life in what appeared to be a

fruitless search. Determined to go down with the an gel
of his life, or else to rescue her lovely form from its briny
grave, he defied the waves, which were becoming terribly
strong as they rolled in a resistless tide to the shore. ill is
herculean efforts were exhausting him, and his strength
was failing no less rapidly than his heart was sinkhig
with disappointment and despair. lie was afar out froii
the stakes, and was swimming and diving between the
ropes, when suddenly Kate's quick eye caught a glimpse,
of something which grew larger and more defined, as she
screamed, "Fred,! here-quick!" From her prostrate
position upon the beach, where she knelt and prayed and
wept, she discovered Daisy's golden locks floating upon
the water, and a nearer sight exposed a face white as
marble, and a form enrobed in a blue bathing-suit. Sev-
eral gentlemen then plunged in again and swain to the
rescue; but, true in death as in life, the pulseless and ~
insensible, body floated almost into the arms of its lover;
and poor Fred, exhausted and fainting, gained the shore,
and laid his "beauteous bride" at Kate's feet. Every
restorative was applied, but in vain, for her 'soul had
winged its flight to that God from whom tt came.
Laying there dead, in all her youth and beauty, stony
indeed must have been the heart that could have listened
unmoved to the lamentations of the bereaved lover:
"Not dead-oh, no! no! no! Daisy, my own darling
open your blue eyes, if but once only, to look upon your
lover, where he kneels in his anguish! Come back, 'i~y
angel-my pet! And such a death! To think how
fondly 1 would~ have folde&amp; you to this heart, whose
every throb is yours! But, instead of my caresses, the
greedy waves Jashed you in their fury, while the briny

waterS pressed those lips which my kisses should have
covered!"
Soon they bore her to the hotel, and throughout the
long, lonely watches of that night his incoherent plead-
ings never ceased. The dance-hall was deserted; no
muSic was -..heard, and the gay laugh and idle jest were
hushed. A cloud rested upon friend and stranger, and
~neither {ime nor distance will ever obliterate the memory
of this heart-rending occurrence. Maud had been ap-
prised of it by telegram, and a torrent of bitter tears
flowed for this faultless creature whom she loved so
dearly. Both Ruth and Mr. D'Estaing shared her grief,
as did the entire community; for Daisy had no enemies,
and it might have been truly said,
"None knew her but to love her,
None named her but to praise."
Thus "leaf by leaf the roses began to fall," and Maud.
shuddered as she wondered who would be the next victim
in the gay Ictrterre. Was the hand of sorrow to be
stretched over them all, one by one, until none should
remain without a blight .~

filled to overflowing with the good and the true, all of
whom seemed eager to pay the last sad tribute to one of
earth's fairest flowers. In the midst of the solemnity
that reigned, ~ lovely soprano voice sang pleadingly and
willingly, "The Reaper and the Flowers." It touched
the sympathetic chord in every heart there assembled,
and low sobs filled the iloly temple.

but Fred sheds no tears, as he sits with bowed head and
bleeding heart; and, shuddering at Kate's excessive grief,
Maud wonders if she can be the same hoyden of other
days.
Service concluded, the flower-decked coffin was borne
from the church by loving hands, and the funeral train
moved sadly and slowly in the direction of Buonaven-
ture, that silent, weird, melancholy city of the dead.
The grave was already 'yawning and waiting to. receive
its beautiful treasure; and as the coffin was lowered, and
some clods of earth thrown in upon it, these words~ of
truth fell upon the bursting hearts of the bystanders, and
made solemnity more solejjnn:
"Man that is born of a woman has but a short time to
live, and is full of misery. He comet up, and is cut
down like a flower; he fleet as it were a shadow, and
never continued in one stay. In the midst of life we are
in death. Of whom may we seek for succor but of
Thee, 0 Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased?"
etc.
At length the voice ceased; the grave that stood open
was filled, and all had left but Fred, who threw himself
in an abandon of~ grief upon the mound which held his
life, his love.
The wind was sighing through the long moss; the sun
was low adown the sky; the shadows were lengthening
over "ghoul-haunted woodland of ~Weir," and Fred
crouched still lower in the darkness, and wept his "lost
Uhdiime."

A LOVER'S QUARREL.
CHAPTER XXIX.
A LOYER~ 5 QUARREL.
ATE, your conduct is sadly changed towards
me of late," said Harry Fielder, a few even-
ings after the funeral.
"And I an~ sadly changed," answered this capricious
creature, as, seating herself by the centre-table, she buried
her face in both hands, and heaved a deep sigh. A
pretty picture she made, in her long, sowing robes of
Qbombazine and crape, which she wore in memory of~
Daisy.
"And wha4 troubles my darling?" asked Harry in a
tone of tenderness, as he seated himself very near her.
"Oh, nothing-ev~rything!" w~s the impatient reply,
as she pushed her chair back.
"And why am I not to come near you, Kate?" was
asked in a tone that betrayed only too well how deeply
wounded the speaker felt.
"Because I do not desire it," was the reply, as she sat
breaking to pieces, in "wilful waste," an exquisite ivory
fan which was a gift from Harry.
"That surely is the best of reasons." And, slightly
piqued, he moved his chair on the opposite side of the
table, and regarded his wayward love.
Kate did not look up, but toyed with the fan, and for
once seemed subdued.
One of the saddest things in life is the contemplation
of the change that must and will surely come to such
temperaments as Kate's. The stages of such a woman's


life are very nice1~ comprehended by the French, who
speak of them as "prude, coquette, devotee" Or is the
reason to be found in the fact, that a certain amount of
vitality being given to every one, and Kate, having ox-
p~nded so much of herb, had grown prematurely old,
while yet in the flush of youth? Whatever the case may
or may not be, it was quite certain that that quiet or mob
ancholy that comes to such natures had fallen upon her
now, and she would never be the same, again. Like
"Lucile," she might truly have exclaimed, "1 am xveai~y;
I would rest."
The silence was fast becoming unendurable, but neither
one seemed disposed to break it. At length harry said:
"Kate, you promised to appoint a day for our marriage
npon your return."
"I always make it a rule to forget all my promises;
then I am not comp~1ed to fulfil them," was the provok-
ilig reply.
"Then it is your intention not to comply with your
word? "-*and his voice trembled with emotion.
With lips slightly curled, she said,
'~ I did not say that this was to be the exception to the
rule."
"Oh, Kate!" was the exclamation; arid the' anguish
and despair that was expressed in those two words would
have wrung mercy and pity from any heart save that of
*a capricious woman, whose chief delight is to toy and
trifle with the deep devotiofr of some true and honest
man. Ten to one, she discards that sincere love for the
fulsome flattery of some polished rou~. Can any one
explaiii why it is that both men and women so often

with the feelings of those who are nothing to them? ills
it a refined torture that the perversity of humaft nature
spontaneously and gratuitoi~ly prepares for its victims?
Is it the modern rack which lovers institute and married
people perpetuate?
But Kate proceeds with her inquisition, as she answers
his "Oh, Kate!" with "Well, Harry!" and her tone
was as cold and indifferent as the veriest stranger could
have been greeted with.
"Kate, you no longer love me!" And he leaned for-
ward and bent on her a searching look, as if he would
penetrate to the depths of her heart, and read therein his
fate.
"I never told you that ill did-eh, Harry?" was the
heartless rejoinder.
"No, not in so many words.'~ And, being fully
aroused, he now determined to resist all future taunts.
"But you have given me to understand that you did,
by all your 'actions, which speak louder than words '-
by voluntarily Feceiving my undivided attentions-and,
lastly, by engaging yourself to me. You are your own
mistress, Kate, and entirely too independent to be influ-
enced or directed by even the best of friends to enter
into any compact~ that did not suit your fancy. A~ these
circumstances led me to hope-aye, to believe-that you
returned in some degree the love of a heart whose every
throb is yours.. A few short month&amp; ago we were happy
-or I., at least, was supremely so. I lived only in your.
smile; and when I studied that I might become great

ever by my side, encouraging me, and making each day
as happy as the last."
"You speak altogether in the past tense, Harry," was
the heartless reply to this outburst of passion.
"For God's sake, Kate, torture me no more! What II
have said, has been true, and is true now. It is the same
face that haunts me, but a different expression. Where
happiness once beamed, I now see discontent; where I
thought ,there was love, I now behold indifference. Tell
-I
me, Kate, if these are only the wild imaginings of a
heart that is jealous of your slightest word ?-or do you
love me still? Tell me, I implore you!" ~ And he knelt
at her feet.
But no word escaped the lips of that strange being to
quiet the fears of her honest and devoted lover, as he
knelt pleading at her side Turning indifferently away,
and resting her eIb9 on the table, she leaned her head
on her hand, and thus silently rejected that love, that
happiness, which was within her grasp, as only women
recklessly can throw away the few pearls which are scat~
tered on their pathway..
Is there some angel .in disguise that withholds those
blessings which would make this "earth an Eden," and
allows men to follow the dictates of their restless hearts,
until, weary and satiated, they ~cry out in their agony,
"Peace! peace I Where can peace ~be found?"
Turning to TIarl7 and extendingg her hand, which he
kissed most fervently, she said,
"Arise, Harry!' I would not have you kneel; and it
pains me to tell you Ahow change~ I am."
~ITer tone was sad and her Wh~&amp;e manner subdued; but
/ IJiarry noticed nothing, as he said, efcitedly,

Changed!"
"Yes-changed, harry! Not toward you I)~~'tidnlarly,
but towards everything and everybody. Life is no longer
the bright butterfly which I chased a year ago; but all
things seem clouded, and I find myself continually sigh.
mo' and weeping."
"Do not talk so, Kate! It is only the late sad ~ocdur~
rence that makes you feel so depressed. I trust that
Time will heal the wound and bring oblivion to your sem
sitive heart."
Sighing, and shaking her head sadly, she said,
"No. I shall never be the same again."
How truly she spoke, the future will disclose.
"No, never the same to me!" said harry, in the mos~
excited manner ~ and, as a streak of jealousy shot through
his heart, he added, hastily: "For to another is giv~r~
that love that was mine. Another and only one, can call
the smile to your lip, can bring jo~o yo'tir heart, or make
life the same. Is it not so? Are not the words I speak
true? Answer me!" And his quivering lips and flash.
ing eyes rather commanded than asked a reply.
Kate, who a moment before had been all kindness in
endeavoring to break as gently as possible the r6al feek
ings of her heart to Harfy, now no longer cared,, and,
rather glad of an excuse to release herself from a boi~d-
age which was becoming galling,~said, haughtily and ~defi~
antly,
"Granting your words to be true, Mr. Fielder, I do not
acknowledge the authority which you presume to take."
"I claim the ~uthority which niy deep devotion, my
honorable wooing, an~ur engage~nent give. me."
"That engagement is at an end from (his moment,",

said Kate, angrily; and, taking from her fingers a spark~
hug diamond, she handed it to him, saying, "Hero is the
pledge of it."
Taking it, he tossed it across the room, saying, as he
did so,
"Away with such baubles-such pledges!" and then
very sarcastically added, "I presume the solitaire upon
your first finger is the gift of that strolling vagabond,
Guy Witherell. I must congratulate you upon its rare
brilliance!"
"Mr. Fielder," said Kate, whose cheeks were crimson
with the indignation she felt, "Mr. Witherell is a friend
of mine, and I will not hear him spoken of in such dP~.
respectful terms."
But Harry, nothing daunted, continued by saying:
"I presume he purchases his diamonds with the same
invisiblee means' by which he lives. I congratulate you
both upon the posses#uui of such an inexhaustible for.
tune. His love is to be very much prized, because ho
lavishes it only upon those whom he can use. I wish you
much joy of your new lover."
As she arose to her feet, 4~e said,
"Mr. Fielder, it is best that the conversation, already
COQ prolonged, should end." And, walking to the door,
she said, with trembling voice and flashing eye, "I wish
yori good-night."
her slow and stately step resounded along the hall,
and, ascending the stairway, she reached her chamber but
to cast herself in an agony of tears upon her sleepless
couch.
Some little time elapsed before harry sufficiently re
covered himself to comprehend wh~t had occurred.

Then, as one in a dream, he left the house, and not caring
whither he went, wended his footsteps slowly in the direc
tion of that lovely spot, Forsyth Place, leaned on the rail-
lug, and gazed at the fountain. But it was a vacant stare,
and he saw not how the moonbeams shimmered upon the
water; he was not aware that the lovely flowers around
that fountain exhaled the sweetest perfume; he 'did not
see the twinkling stars laughing at each other, and all the
beauties which had been gathered there by artistic hands
were lost upon him.

evening. "Is it not strange that he could write so feel-

was a Wanderer, and had no home."
"We never fully appreciate the blessings which are
ours," replied Maud. "I dare say, if ~Payne had pos-
sessed the 'home' of which he sang, 4e worldd would
have been minus his beautiful poem. UuxJ~ortunat~iy, our
happiness seems never to consist in what w~&amp;h~ye, but in

"TWat's better," said Colonel llartridge.
j'You are a rare exception to the rule," she continued,

"'Contentment gives a crown,
Where fortune bath 'denied it."'

"True, it is only one's self, after all. The heart must
possess the charm of contentment and then there may be
happiness."
At these words, Maud's conscience pierced her with an
accusing .sting. Then, looking long and peeringly into
the shadowy twilight, she shuddered to think how her
husband would be dismayed could he but get a single
glimpse into her restless, wayward heart; and in a
kind of soliloquy,' and more to herself than to him, she
said,
"If "tis home wherever the heart is,' what singular
abodes hearts must take to themselves! And, to trans~
pose Shakespeare, that would be giving 'a local habita-
tion'to 'airy nothings.'"
You surely do not call hearts 'airy' nothings'?" said
Colonel .Ilartridge, mockingly.
"Only figuratively," she sighed.
"Without changing the subject, Ntaud, I cannot tell
you how happy I am to be at home once more, and above
ollto see you so much improved!"
"I believe I am in better health than w~ien you left,
althoughh I feel very listless at times, and dreadfully de
pressed."

C'HOME, SWEET HOME!,,          208
"You must cheer up, and be gay like your old self.
and not move around so ghost-like," said he, tenderly.
As if she could be gay with such a weight of love and
despair dangling at~ her heart-strings!
Although his words were faultlessly conventional,~ no
warm kiss or gentle embrace accompanied them; 'and
he sat at a distance, as cold and undemonstrative as an
iceberg. Thus it ever was. His love, that Maud had no
cause to doubt, was most generally left to be instinctively J
felt or passively inferred; it was never demonstrated.
In the meantime, her ~oul was hungry for the all-
absorbing devotion that the exacting heart of woman J
demands, and without which her life, at best, is empty,
and devoid of interest. (Why will men never under~
stand that it is the little things of life which make
women happy? A caress, a kiss at parting and return~
ing, a flower brought or sent, a shawl folded lovii~gly
about her shoulders-indeed, any trifling attention whidi
silently tells her she is remembered. But love must be~
demonstrated, just as if it were some abstruse Sciefloer ~
and not left to be imagined. And in like manner must \ ~.,
it be fed. J Do not all flames become extingushed,~ud
exhaust themselves , unless fresh fuel be couBtantly
added?
Both. Colonel Hartridge and ~Eaud had fallen into a
reverie, which was finally broken by him:
"Maud, D'Estaing will be here this evening to tea
and I am really very glad, for I have not had a long t~k
with him since ruy return."
With these words he entered the hall, and Maud. ~

coming? or is there an invisible electric wire that corn-
7 municates with and sends a thrill of ecstatic joy bound-
ing from one heart to another?
A moment before, Maud fancied a shapeless shadow
stood' behind the Pulaski monument; but as it advanced
nearer and nearer, the well-known proportions of the suN
ject of her thoughts were clearly defined, and in another
instant, standing by her side, he pressed her hand, and
whispered,
"Dearest!"
Her lips had always refused to greet her idol of flesh
and blood with the cold conventionalities which society
demanded, and which were addressed to others, so she
was silent, and pointed him to a seat.
"Have we not time for a stroll in the park?" said
he.
"I suppose so," she answered.
"Comethen;Imust speak to you to-night, or I shall
die!"
Without another word, they descended the steps and
walked slowly by in the shadow of the monument, which
is at once a source of pride and an honor to Savannah, to
that lovely park almost um'ivalled in its simple yet lush
beauty.
The street was thronged with gay promenades return-
inghonie, and the park ..was comparatively deserted, for
evening was gathering thickly her purple ~hades over the
twilight landscape. The careless jest and light laugh of
the passers-by fell heavily over the hearts of Maud and
D'Estaing, for they were both wretched and silent. After
trollingg around for some little while and remarking 111)011
the beauty of the fountain, they seated theniseWes in a

retired spot, where they were free from intrusion and
interruption..
"It seems like a century since I saw you last," said
Maud.
"It seems like two centuries to me," replied D'Estaing,
gazing by the gas-lamp into her glorious eyes. "But tell
me, Maud, are you now ready to give me the proof of
your love for which I have so long pleaded?"
"What fresh proof do you desire?"
"Will you fly with me?"
his voice trembled from excitement, and' his whole
frame was shaken by the emotion which thrilled, him.
heaven only knows how, in that hour, she was tempted
to say "Yes!" and what a struggle it eost her not to
accede to his request. Her tongue was bridled, but a
whirlpool was raging in her breast, and her brain was on
fire.
D'Estaing bent over her, until his breath, like the gasp
of a dying man, fanned her cheek. They were face to
face, if not heart to heart, and in the darkness he pressed
her hand until she could have cried with pain, but no
word escaped her lips.
"Will you fly with me?" he repeated again and
again.
how temptingly did love and pleasure beckon~ her to~
an untried Eden! And, as if viewing with each other
they both attempted to silence her conscience, and steep
it in those oblivious draughts which make a crimfue a vir-
tue. But the shadow of duty loomed up before her, and,
submitting not to her inclinations, but 'the law which

arose. "We will return now.~~
Offering her his arm, they walked slowly and sadly
home, and found Colonel Jlartridge impatiently awaiting
them.

to jAon as women; and D'Estaing, with all his seeming
indAlference, was not impervious to its dulcet tones. Oh,
those maio~uvring inammas I No wily politician, versed
in the intrigues of a corrupt capital, becomes a greater
proficient in his art than do these female in~rigantes in
the profession of their adoption. Young women, whose
mothers possess this kind of fnesse, need have no fears as
regards their future state; for, be they pretty or ugly,
bright or stupid, rich or poor, if they will only walk in
the path planned for them by their feminine IRichelieu,
their bark will at last be anchored in the harbor Matrb

The vanity of a certain misanthropic gentleman 'viii~s
wonderfully flattered as he read and reread the note of
Ruth Leigh, the first thing the morning of Ia fete. Not
indifferent to the compli~'nent contained in those few
lines, he determined to comply with the request-thus
disregarding a previous engagement, which until that
moment he had held as sacred. Fortunately, his valise
was packed, and, having only a few minutes, he sprang
into a hack, and arriving in time, stepped upon the train
just as it started. His movements had been too hasty for
a message or a note, and whatever qualms of conscience
intruded themselves in regard to the broken engagement,
were silenced by the flattering- thought that h~s "fastidP
ous taste" was to be consulted about the preparations
going on at the "Hermitage." However, there was little
leisure for reflection in the few minutes which brought
him to the desired haven, and his handsome. face was
wreathed in smiles, as, stepping from the cars, he caught
a glimpse of Ruth leaning upon the gate which opened
into her mother's grounds. In' another moment he had

joined her, and her childlike beauty filled him with fresh
admiration, as she said, in silvery tones,
"Ab, Mr. D'iEstaing, mamma will be so delighted that
you have come! for she i~ in quite a dilemma about the
grotto, or something-I don't ~know what it is, for I have
been too busy with my toilettes, II regret to say, t6 be of
much assistance to her."
"My knowledge of such things is limited, Miss Leigh;
but what little I do know, I wili feel honored in placing
at your mother's command."
"She said you had told her of a similar ~f~te you once
attended in France, and she thought you might be able to
give her some useful hints. But here she is, to speak
for herself; and as I am superintending the pitching of
some tents in the woods below, you will please excuse
me.
With these words, she bowed, and vanished beneath
the overhanging branches of the grandest of grandjp~ks,
which were rendered more beautiful by the long moss in
which they were gracefully draped.
Both mother and visitor were silent as they looked after
her for a moment; then, with all that ease and elegance
of manner for which the 'ladies of that particular section
are so justly celebrated, Mrs. Leigh said,
"how very kind of you to respond so promptly to our
rather informal request, Mr. ID'Estaing I And believe
me, I deeply appreciate your goodness."
"Pray don't mention it, Mrs. Leigh," he said, grace~
fully lifting his hat, and bowing with that indefinable
ease which prevails among Southern gentlemen; "but as
tur time is limited, let's to work."
D'Estaing had been a frequent visitor at the "IiermW

ageA' since Ruth's return from the city, which was no~
more than two months. Each time he discovered some
new beauty at this lovely country seat; and as Mrs.
KLeigh and himself sauntered slowly down the grand aye-
n uc which led to the house, he thought that, abroad or at
home, he ha~ never seen any spot of earth which pleased
him so thoroughly.
Leaving them to seek their field of labor, the reader
will join, unobserved, another party, in which the mem
hers seemed to be unusually happy on that bright and
cloudless morning; and even if the shadows do lengthen
as the sun sweeps down to his western couch, why may
not the cloud be snatched from the pathway of one of
them? Because, "to live is to suffer!"
Kate and Guy were chatting merrily, and Colonel
Hartridge was in an unusual glee, as he assisted his beau.
tiful young wife from the carriage. Then, bidding them
a hasty adieu, he sent many "regrets" to Mr~~ Leigh at
his inability to attend the fUe, and drove rapidly away,
as the train moved off.
The boxes were crowded with the dlite, the fashion,
the beauty, and the chivalry of the Forest City, all of
whom were em route for the "Hermitage," to participate
in the last of the autumnal festivities. A magnificent
brass band discoursed, most appropriately, "It is better to
laugh than be sighing," and it bu1~ expressed the senti-
inent of all hearts, for apparently it was the determine.
Lion of the gay crowd to make it
"The maddest, merriest day,
Of all the glad new year."
A shade of disappointment rested ll~Ofl Maud'~ face,

LA Fh E CHAMP RB.            211
as she peered in every direction and yet caught no glimpse
of the one for whom she sought. This would only hav
been perceptible to a close observer; and, fortunately for
her, her friends were too happy to discover anything but
happiness in others. Such intense love as this infatuated
woman felt may be compared to Paradise on one side
and Perdition on the other; a~d her fears and suspicions
made her wretched beyond description, while she asked
in vain, "Where can the absent one be?" Thus it would
seem that love, that ideal thing, that shadowy myth, for
which so many hearts are yearning, is but a mixture of
smiles and tears, which brings more misery thaai happi-
ness, and ends its brief existence in keen ~nd hitter dis..
appointments. Then why is it so eagerly chased?
Whilst Maud was indulging in these reflections, the
train had moved steadily on, and they were now at the
entrance to the " Ilermitage." Instead of following the
crowd d~wn the broad avenue of oaks and moss, the trio
in question took a winding path through the woods, and
at leno'th found themselves in sight of a pavilion, which
was remP~red particularly striking by the red and whke
material of which it was composed. It covered a plat-
form, which was carpeted and furnished in real Eastern
style, while upon a miniature throne IMirs. Leigh sat,
receiving her guests with an ease and elegance which
would have done credit to the blood-royal. A little in
the rear, Ruth .stood conversing with some gentleman
whose back was turned to the party who advanced to pay
their respects. After the customary salutations, Guy and
Kate passed on,.but Maud lingered, and Mrs. Leigh then
said,
"Ruth, here is an old friend."


i2~

LA ]? ~Th C1iA~fl~frFRE.
At these words, Ruth and the gentleman who was with
her b0th turned, and Maud started, as D'Estaing unex~
peetedly advanced and pressed her hand. The life of
deception that society forces upon women makes them all
actresses to some extent; and it was well for Mand, on
this occasion, that she recovered herself so quickly, or she
might have been mortified by an unpleasant scene. After
exchanging the coldest conventionalities, she said,
"Excuse me; I will rejoin my party."
"Allow me to escort you," said D'Estaing, offering his
arm.
"Thank you; I prefer to go alone," was ths cold
reply, as she gave him one withering glance and walked
rapidly away.
Kate was surrounded, as usual, by a gay party, and,
after bowing to them, Maud said,
"Guy, give me your arm.~~
"With all my heart! But what's the matter?, Have
you been seeing~ hamlet's ghost, or yc~r grandniother's

"I Eeel a little faint,'~but will soon be better. Here-.

soul with anguish9 Then came the question, "Why h~4
he broken his engagement with her, and how came lie on
such intimate terms with the Leighs?"
Drinking the writer eagerly which Guy brought,: she,
scarcely understood him wheft he said:
"I hate to leave you alone, Coz, but will be compelled
to do so, as I am to dance this quadrille with Kate. Or
shall I tell her that you are ill, and bring her here?"
"Not for the world! Indeed, I am quite ~veU flow,

"Only upon one condition: and that is, that you honor

But, without noticing her words, he said,

Scarcely heeding him, she threw her head back against~

away, the band 'ceased~ to play, and the gay dancers dis~
persed. Merry peals of laughter rang out upon the
woods, and the parti-colored costumes flitting here and
there beneath the dark green foliage made the scene bril.
liant beyond description.
The fairy-like grounds were bathed in a gorgeous Octo.
bei~ sun; the air was delicious and balmy as Spring, and
to all save two the day was as joyous as a cherub's drear~
Soon a charming galop was wafted on the air, and Guy
came in haste to claim Maud as his partner. Seizing her
by her hand, he rather forced than led her to the plat.
form, and in another moment they were, floating in the
mazy dance. Thus, in an instant, she had passed from
the depths of despair into recklessness, as only women
can.
Having paused in the dance while Guy went for a
glass of lemonade, she was rather startled, as ID'Estaing
stood before her, and said,
"What! are you dancing?"
"And pray why not, since you set me so good an
example?"
"Ah, but I was dragged into it," he said, impatiently.
"Which was not so light Q~ a task, I should imagine,"
was the laughing reply.
"Do you intend dancing again?"
"Certainly she does!" said Guy. "Is it not better to
laugh than be sighing?"
Without noticing the speaker, D'Estaing again ad.
dressed Maud, saying,
"May I have the honor of the next dance?"
"I am engaged."
"Well, then, the next?"

"Eno~aoed."
"And the next?"
"Engaged." And, in her heart, Maud perhaps felt a
pardonable triumph at thus checkmating him at his own
game.
"Then you are engaged for the whole day?" he asked,
rather haughtily, while a sneer rested upon his peerless
lip.
"Yes," she answered, and her voice did not tremble,
and her eye was steady as she returned his penetrating
gaze. Like Prometheus in the burning marl, the pride
of Women sustains them, what, though their hearts are
breaking.
"Come, Coz, let's finish the galop." And in another
moment they were whirling around to the merry strains
of music. D'Estaing stood looking after. her a little
while, then walked slowly and sadly away.

wits about her would voluntarily provoke the gossip of
he~' sisters, knowing as she does that their covert sneers
and whispered thrusts would soon torture a saint into a
fiend. These laws are such a wonderful combination of
the angelic and satanic, that nothing short of Machia-
velli's astute brain ~ould discover the mud and slime that
lie at the bottom of the beautifully clear surface; and
yet every one must walk therein, or be subjected to social
ostracism.
Maud's heart went with ID'Estaing; and could she have
yielded to its guilty dictates, she would have followed
him, and, throwing herself upon his bosom, would there
ha~ve ~wept the tears which were pleading to be shed. But
no; they must back to their "briny bed," and she must
-     dance and laugh while her heart is breaking, for society
demands the sacrifice, and would be outraged at any
betrayal of feeling.
On the banks of a beautiful lake which was skirted by
woods, the tables were spread, and a sumptuous repast
was served. But when the heart is lacerated, and torn,
and bleeding, the far-famed "nectar and ambrosia" of
the gods would tempt the appetite in vain; and so Maud
thought, as, taking a cup ~f coffee only, she turned* in
sickening disgust away fr~m the luxuries which were
placed before her.

down, the guests sought their respective chambers, in

had ~been seen or heard of D'Estaing since the
morning, and Maud thought perhaps he had returned t~

thrown himself upon the groufid in utter dejection. His
hat was drawn over his face, and the deep sighs whieli
came from his heart were freighted with untold agony.
They were thinking and dreaming of each other; and
yet, how far apart they seemed! for she felt forsaken,
while he thought her too resentful. And here is but
another evidence of "how easily things go wrong."
And when they shall be righted, is still another thing.
After much persuasion, Maud had reluctantly yielded.

Kate had enjoyed a refreshing nap, and, as Mau4~av~
the finishing touches to her toilette, she swept gracefully
from the room, and called back, as she drew down here

Scarce heeding her words, and crushed with the weight
of a coming woe which she could hot throw off Maud
sank into a chair, and cried, in the agony of her heart,
"God help me!"

diately surrounded by a crowd of gay makers, and, yield.
lpg to their entreaties, was soon whirling in the giddy
dance. Feeling no interest in attempting to make discov.
eries, she traversed every room, hall, and gallery, but in
vain, for no "Friar" gratified her anxious search.
At the same hou~ Kate was standing upon an eastern
balcony, listening with intense (?) interest to the undying
protestations of a certain Spanish cavalier, who by arti
ficial wits and natural stupidity had mk~saken her for his
bright particular star. The conversation w~s suddenly
interrupted by a maker in the costume of a "Friar,"
who made his unexpected presence known, by saying,
"Will the 'Goddess of Night' honor me with a prome~.
nade?"
happy to be rid of her insipid companion, Kate said:
"With pleasure!" And taking the proffered arm, she
added: "It is but right that we should commune to~
gather, for the night alone spes and knows the many
charitable deeds which are done by the holy order you
represent."
"Would that my heart w~s as pure as my outside dress
signifies it should be 1"
"Whose who underrate themselves are always the most
worthy, I believe."
A heavy sigh was the "Friar's" only response, and
they walked on for some distance in silence. Kate, who
was always courting adventure, thought she was now
about to have a real ones a~ her mysterious escort took a
by~.path which was comparatively quiet, and which was
apparently ~visited only by themselves. The grounds

heightened by the numbers of gayly-dressed promEnaders,
who sought a moment's respite from the heated air of the
rooms.
The "Friar" did not doubt for an instant but that it ~
was Maud who leaned upon his arm, for he never dreamed
of such a thing as an exchange of costumes; and when
the mask is down~ it gives a muffled tone to the voice
which would easily prevent a recognition. At length
they arrived at what seemed to be the entrance to a cave,
and the "Friar" said,
"If you will permit me, I will lead you to a spot where
you may reign a veritable and undisputed queen."
"It is the one spot above all others that I should like
to visit."
her words reassured him, and he verily believed that
the one so eagerly looked for had her face hid beneath
that star-spangled mask.
"A live wizard and a~real adventure!" thought Kate,
and her fearless heart fluttered with excitement as her,
escort led her down a short subterranean passage, which
soon opened into a gorgeous chamber all hung with ever~.
greens, and brilliantly illuminated. The soft murm~ir
gurgling water was heard, as the sprays of water from
the fountain in the centre of the grotto sparkled and
flashed in the blinding light, like so many diamond dIW~
drops.
A burst of admiration broke upon the silence, as K.Kate
exclaimed;
"how enchanting! Ah, I see it all-I am the heroine
of one of the 'Arabian Nights" stories! This is your

from Mrs. Leigh, asking. mc to come by the earliest train

folded his arms about her, when the mask was quickly
thrown up, and, to his amazement, Kate Byrd said,

you address."

as if to hide her from his sight, he sank upon the rocks
near by, overwhelmed with the agony of 8 love misplaced
-~a~ love rejected-a love betrayed. Exceptthe splash.
ing of the water in the fountain; the silence of death
prevailed. After a while D'Estaing said, as if speaking
to himself,
"Great God! what have I 4one?"
"Only made a slight mistakee" answered Kate, in her
most taunting manner, while a bitter smile lurked in tho
corners of her mouth; for, to tell the truth, she almost
hated the man who sat cowering at her feet. Arising
hastily,~ and with a depth of feeling which was not
feigned, he said,
"Miss Byrd, I am painfully aware of the state of yonx
feelings towards me; but could you see into my heart~-
could you know what a cruel wrong I have done her for
whom I would freely lay down my life, I think that even

now, by the love that you bear her, let me beg that this
interview shall go down to the grave with you. Promise

Kate bore no malice against this proud man, who was

made in behalf of one whom she loved so dearly, and
whom she would not injure ror the world, she said,

"Ybur pardon, Miss Byrd; but may I escort you t
the house?"
"If you please." And, taking his proffered arm, they
walked slowly and silently out of the grotto and along
the serpentine walks.
Kate wore a subdued and almost melancholy air;
while D'Estaing's breathing came quick and hard, like
that of a man struggling with a great grief. Just before
they reached the house, he said, as a suspicion flashed
upon him,

They had now t~eached one of the immerous entrances
to the beautiful house, which resembled an illuminated
r~l~ce, and D'Estaing said,
"If yon will excdse me, Miss Byrd, I will not go in."
"Oert~iniy," said Kate, in a softened tone.
Then taking her hand in both ide, lie looked beseech-
ingly in her eyes, and said,
"Eemernber your promise!"

She was aroused from her reverie by Guy, who shool~
her rather rudely, as he said:
"Where in the mischief have you been?"
"Let him discover who can. But how did you know
who I was?"
"Wh~r, isn't your mask up?" laughed Guy.
"No ~ is it?" she asked, and feelhig for it. "Oh,

"Remember what?" asked Guy.
~ "Find out, if you can," she smiled.
"Well, come; let's in to supper. (Joz is waiting for
you, and everybody is wondering whether you are lost,

By this time~ they had gained the suppeir~room,. where
every one was unmasked, and evidently enjoying the lnx~
uries they were discussing? Maud was sitting in the
embrasure of a window, with a gay exterior and a ~he~r~i
pierced by a dagger. Soon they left the joyous ci~ow4

CHAPTER XXXII.
~~ThAR AND BILLIARDS."
0 sparkling or tn-colored jets allured the passer-
by into entering one of those dens of iniquity,
which sometimes conceal their real character
under the genteel 8obriquet of "Turf Exchange," "TI&amp;
'~alaxy," or "Pleasant hours." No; it was only plain
"Bar and Billiards," so that whoever walked beneath that
truthful sign did it with eyes wide open and the conse
quences apparent.
There had been a number of gay revellers assembled
in this parth~ular saloon that evening, but it was now
nearing midnight, and only a few of the most misguided
.remained.
Two men sat apart, in a corner to themselves, watching
at a table a game of faro, and betting hea~vily. The one
was a stranger, the other a citizen-a good, quiet, respect-
able,, law-loving and law-abiding man, who had been
lured'into this haunt of vice, by the tempting accounts of
~his newly-found friend c?), who had, induced him to be- ~
lie~e that he could realize the possession of wealth in a
single night, an4. raise his family from poverty to riches.
i~t was a mighty~st4ke f~r~which he played, and his' inter~
est deepened as red or black told I~or or against'h~m' At

first h~e staked all the money lie had; lie then put up hi~
watch, furniture, his wife's piano, his house; and la~t ~4
all his wife's jewels and silver, and saw thena all swept
away by the relentless grasp of Chance. And thus one
phase of recklessness begot another, and another, an4
another, until White was wild. That he was not hhns~W
could have been easily discovered; and the cause was
soon explained, for a lunch-table near them was covered
with empty bottles, the labels of which betrayed what
had been the nature of their contents-poison for the
brain, poison for the heart, and death in the glow an4
sparkle.
White drank and better, and better and drank, until
all of his pecuniary possessions slipped from him, an4
until he knew he was ruined beyond the power of retrieve.
Although heated by stwng potations and excited by play,
he was not insensible to the fact that the morrow would
find his family houseless and penniless; and already the
cries of his children for bread, and the moans of his d~.
dressed wife, sounded in his ears. Goaded to desperation
~iy these harrowing thoughts, he determined to make eue
inal effort to secure ~vhat he had so recklessly throw~i
away. ~o, draining a glass'of brandyhe said, with an
oath:
"Just one more game, and P11 win, or die 1" 'But 1*
reckoned without his host; for at Paris and at Baden
Baden his dark-eyed opponent was said t~ have won niie
times out of ten; then how could he ho~~ta c*pe whh

table, "unless you have found something else to l~

"1~ot quite so fast, my friend!" cried White, 6ezing
his ann in a very determined manner; "you shall restore
we my rights, or, by the living G-d, you shall pay the
penalty of your trickery and swindling with your life1
Sit down! Be quick-before I kill you where you
Mand!" And at the same time he drew forth a pistol
from its hiding-place, as if to make hi~ words good.
"Your rightss,' ind~ed~!" ~hissed his desperate oppo-
nent. "1~elease me this instant, or I will teach you what
my rights are, instead of chaffering with you about what
you deem ~pur rights, as you please to term then~i."
"Never, until you have relinquished what you have
~tokn from me!" said White, under his breath, his teeth
chattering and his pale lips qtiivering. "Will you do
it t" And 'he tightened his clasp around, his enemy's
throat, who gasped,
"Never! never 1"
Thex, as quick as thought, this midnight assassin
plunged a dagger up to the hilt in t~he breast of poor
White, who uttered a single broken shriek, and fell fQr'
ward on his face. At the same moment, the pistol held
in ~iis hand went off, hut; beii~g aiinkss, it ~vas only a
stray shot, and the villain at whom it should have been
~oi:ied stood gloating over the triumph of the dead and
the ruined.
D'Estaing, who was passing by from his office on Bay
street to his rooms at the Pulaski House, hearing the
,uoise, entered just in time to lift the dying man in his
arms as he drew his last breath. The perpetrator of this
horrible deed still stood there as one petrified, while the
clenched' dagger in his hand was reeking with blood.
D'Estaiug looked up at him.

"My God ~ what have you done?" he exclaimed.
"Murderer! villain!"
The eyes of these two men met.
"What! Delamere-here!" cried the stranger, hii
wicked eyes staring out with a frightened though stonV
expression.
"Here!" answered D'Estaing, "and not afraid to
inect an unscrupulous villain by the name of Bonne.
theau!" he added, with intrepid coolness.
"Since when did you turn saint? Since~ the murder
of your cousin, Gustave Delainere?" said Bonnethean,
"Seize this man!" said D'Estaing to the bystanders'
as he held his dead burden in his arms.
"Let him who dares touch me at his peril!" crie&amp;
Bonnetheau, flourishing the bloody dagger over his dishes~
elled head; "for I swear mo~t solemnly to kill that main
who may lay the weight of his finger upon me!" And 4.
as he stood mad in the rage of an infuriated demon, n~
one seemed willing to defy his threats.
Stupefied by liquor and late hours, the three or four
loafers who still lounged about the saloon were ne~i~ '
asleep than awake, and, instead of coming to the~ai44 1,
ID'Estaing, they all seemed terrified into inaction; an4
not until it was too late, were they fully aroused to ~
horror 'of the situation and the necessity of action.
By this time l3onnetheaii~. had waThed' around to the
entrance ~on Bull street, and, standing in the doo~ cast &amp;

his teeth:                              /

and, turning the lifeless body of' the murdered man' ovei
to one of the bystanders, he rushed fearlessly after the
murderer. Even before he had gained the door, Bonne~
thean was a square away, and ere the alarm could be
given to the police, at least a mile, fleeing as rapidly as
* he could in the direction of the woods.
Unsuspicious of such a movement, D'Estaing and the
detectives scoured the city from attic to basement;' but
the wretch had made his escape, and the only consolation
that could be derived in all the horrible detail of this
tragedy was in the fact that he did, not dare return and
claim the house and property of the widow and orphans.
But that was of little avail to them-little to the man
who was dead to the outraged community-dead to God,
whose laws he had defied.
"Thou shalt do no murder." Thus said the Lord of
Illiosts, amid the glory of Sinai, when the lawgiver of
Israel heard his voice above the thunder which proclaimed
Ills majesty. And yet, such murders as these nightly
blacken the scroll' of crime, and the Gains step forth from
K' ~loons rich in gilding ~nd pictures and tapestries, and;

force be made to wink or tolerate.
are equally guilty who patronize "The Turf Ex
change,"'" The Galaxy," or.j' Bar and l3illiard3;" and
outside of their fatal portals, who can know the destroyci
front the destroyed? It is well, society owes much to the
rigor of judgment, which is nearly akin to injustice.
Gambling is a vice, in any and in avery form in which it
~may be presented; but there shoul~l be a difference made,

in a moral point of view, between the victim ~ud the vk~
timized-the man whom a morbid thirst for excitement
drives to drink of the poisoned bowl, and the practiced
villain whose business it 'is to point or lead the way to
where it is presented in its most fascinating fonn&amp;~
wreathed with flowers and heavy with aroma, glittering
with gold and sparkling like the diamond.
Is' murdered morality more venial than the murder of
the physical body? Is religion of God, or God where
such crimes are practiced? Is law justice, or~ is ther~'
any justice in the law, as administered through the bloat-

And ~what though in~re than seven ceLturies have
passed away since this unhappy couple trod the tragic
boards of life? Their memories are still embalmed in the
richest aroma of romance, and their double grave is one
of the greatest attractions at P~re le Chaise.. Flowers
are ever abloom upon them; if not the fresh, culled from
the prolific gardens of sunny France, the same immor
tells which till late wreathed the iron balustrade around
the column of Yend6me, from which the elligy of the
~t Emperor looked down over gay, beautiful, surging,
heartless Paris.
No matter how outraged patriots, philanthropists, phil.
osophers, and the world generally, in~y feel by s'ich an
assertion, it is evident that no other sentiment of the
Jan man heart has ever elicited such profound and widely-
extended sympathy as love. And it would seem that this
mysterious, inexplicable feeling, which passes through the
heart as the electric current flies through air, is the one
grand bond uniting the souls of mankind, and making
them beat as with a single throb. It is the same setiti-
gient which makes them realize a secret pleasure in res4-
bag the loves of Petrarch andiLaura, Dante and Beat~'jce,
Tasso and Leonora D'Est~, Antony and Cleopatra, J3yron
sand Mary Chaworth; though with this "divine passion"
there is so often interwoven the elements of sin, as in the

At any rate, if love is to be immortalized, let it not be
the hot-house passion born of forced sentiment and nui~
tured by guilt-the intriguing devotion of Abelard for
Heloise, as seen through French eyes, nor the unpardon~

it be the feeling which grows out of mutual esteem, con~
genial tastes and sympathies, ieverential virtue,. couee~

trial through the usual ordeal of domestic life. Let it ba

~fen have the world before them, to use and bend it at

xiot men withhold it. Let them be tender with their

"Do I think I love you? Why, whs~t a strange ques-
tion 1" said Ruth, in the brilliant moonlight t1~at flooded
the balcony where they sat, her eyes looking the love her
lips refused to speak.
Their ~gagement was now openly acknowledged, and
Ruth was not more radiantly happy than her mother was
gratified. But was ID'Estaing happy? Did no memory
of departed days haunt him? Did no \spectre of her
who was forsaken rise up before him, and with beseech~
iiig eyes say, "Look on the ruii~. you have wrought?"
Three months of almost c~ii~ant intercourse with Ruth
had brought D'Est~ing to her feet, and nearly obliterated
9thcr days and other faces from his memory. Is anyone
~ shocked? him stud men more closel and there
A will be no occasion for surprise again.
It wonk. not, however, e just, to say that, the conduct
~f D'Estaing was premeditated. It seemed purely the
consequence of accident. The misunderstanding on the
morning of the fete, the resentment, and the culminating
scene in.7 the grotto, had all combined to hasten the result.
From the niokuent '~when he discovered ~he exchange of

costumes, he believed Maud false. ~That she w~ iiripe.
rious and exacting, he knew, and from that hour hi8 w~t
ship grew less intense, his love waned. And a~ day t~fte1
(lay of comparative tranquillity passed by, he ab~ohitdy
felt a relief at being~ rid of the tyranny under whieli he
had lived for so many months. He was lonely and
wretched, with no friend or relative to whom he could
turn for sympathy. Mrs. Leigh and Ruth wei~e ufiren1itd~
ting in their kiiidnesses; and their attentions fell upc~n
his weary heart like dew upon the opening flowers that
were withering in too fierce sunshine.
Every day saw him a visitor at the "Hermitage," and.
every day he returned to the eity with a positive engage-
ment, either for breakfast, dinner, or tea, with his newly~

lie was sad and thoughtful; Ruth was gay and cheery.
He needed a friend, and Mrs. Leigh soothed him ii1 mo~
ments of depression and gloom. Both mother and d~u~h-
ter extended to him, the sympathy and tenderness craved
by his storm-beaten heart; and who can. wonder at the
result?
It sometimes happens that those very women who would
give the last drop of their heart's blood for that worsh4~
from the other sex that is their due, drive the subject of
this idolatry from them, by the tyrannous demands of
mere caprice. Q~ove prefers amusement to torture~ ~n4

the time for the celebration of the nuptials was near at
hand.
"Why such haste?"
Thd he fear that some invisible hand. would snatch his

were festooned curtains of the richest and heaviest s~
~brocatelie; while each room was fr1rnished in ~ll the ~
geousness and extravagance of Eastern luxury. - The car~
pets were of the richest velvet; and the eyes were feasted
on ~ from the hands of masters; statues of the
most exquisite design and finish, antique bronzes, vases 4
the rarest workmanship, and a wealth of ornament that
can better be imagined than described. The chandeliers,
which flooded the rooms with a soft, mellow light, were
of the finest cut-glass, in the rarest patterns; and their
prismatic pendants sent quivering rainbow4ints flashing
in every direction. The walls were tastefully frescoed,
and delicious harmony, elegance, and a faultless fancy
pervaded each room, from the dainty play-room in sky~
blue to the breakfast-parlor in fresh rose-color, the sea~
green of a beautifully-arranged library, and the soft
warm crimson of the reception-parlor. There was noth..
ing pronomed, xiaught that savored in the least of the
&amp;~ornmon or vulgar, in the appointments of the place of
habitation- of Alfr~do do Yore, but everything bespoke.
purity 9f taste and high cultivation. But, notwithsta~d-.
ing, he was a most unhappy man. All this expenditure
of money failed to bring happiness, or even comfort. He
never slept the sweet, natural sleep of one whose mind is
at peace; but when "tired Nature's sweet restorer"
folded its soothing wings over his couch, it was induced
by the heavy potations ivhich bring stupor rather than
rest.
When it .is remembered that only they whose~c'2~u.

the wretch to duty, sleep the innocent sleep of the vhtu*

Field is not the only one whose conscience performs for
lAiti the kindly office of driving away this kindly recuper-
i~tive ageiit, and peopling the night with avenging phan-
toms.
The ]?arian marble toy oui the mantel, encasing the
cunning and beautiful mechanism of a French clock,
~jleutl~ told the hour of four, but the half-dozen dt~bau-
ehe'~ who still lingered in De Yore's apartments evinced
rio symptoms of weariness. The air was heavy with the
incense which forever ascended from those rooms, and
redolent with the odors of rare flowers; and in' this close
~t~n~phere, the mixture of cigar-smoke, the perfume of*
exotics, and gas, was almost stifling; but the revellers
wera scarcely affected by it, flushed as they were with
~irii~e and' ~e~cited by cards. As usual, their host had

choice llavanas, the following conversation occurred:
"And so you are certain it was' Delamere?" came in
~liose musical tones which are so irresistible to women.
"~My life upon. it!" answered Bonnetheau, accompany-

table as to endanger the safety of the cut~glass decanters
and delicate wine-glasses. "And what do you think I

"You did not murder him?" said De Vere, in a toxi~ ~

most gentle deprecation.
"It is indeed to be hoped not!" said Da Vere, with
more than wanted earnestness. But, seeming not to
notice this, I3onnetheau proceeded:

"And you would like to be revenged?" asked Do
V'ere.
"Shouldn't I? I should like to see him at the stake o~
the gallows ; "-..and the grin of a demon lighted up his
earthyy visage. But for the wine which was coursing
hotly through his veins, Bonnethean would never have
been so comm~unicative. It was fortunate for him that
the bond of eternal secrecy-~..-the "honor among thieves"
~~-was imposed upon all who entered those rooms, or his
own disclosure would have doomed him. his compam.
ions wore a set of desperate, adventurous foreigners, and
this fact, ~s much as their profession, allied them closely.
No one replied to l3onnetheau's last remark; they did
not wish to commit themselves, and all eyes turned upon
Do VerQ, as ho sat by a table with his face buried in his
hands.
Surprise and wonder were depicted in every county~
nance; and after a few moments of profound silence,
Do Yore arose, and said, in his courtliest manner,
"I beg that you will all excuse me now;" lint as they

Iind it pleasant. My valet will close the rooms when you
feel like retiring. Au revoir!" And, lowing to all
around, he left their presence.
And so they remained, and talked long and earnestly
about this unexpected, and what promised to be exciting,
news.
Do Yore, upon reaching his bed.~chamber, had thrown
~dn~eli ~~pon hi~ bed with Ida clothes on, but n~ot to sleep.

Iliad he given expression to his thoughts in words, the fob
lowing soliloquy would have been .divulged :~
"Aifd at last the bird has been caught! After six
years of fruitless search, after paying, out thousands t6

discovered; and the ni~n who brings the news asks noth.

And Elise claims at my hands the life of this man, before
she will consent to become the wedded partner of my.
crimes. They who know the secret could be bribed into
silence, and the life of this unfortunate man could be
spared. I have nothing against him, and, God knows, my
crinles are already sufficiently numerous to sink my soul
to perdition. But then-Elise! Well, she is mine at
any rate, but not in the eye of the law; and so tong. as
she is my employee, I wince to think of the thousands~ I.

i~ioments when despair lifted from, her heart its iron
dutch. But, without a groan or a sigh in others' hear.
ing, she steeled herself to endure the bitterest trial that
can come to a woman's heart-p--the fear or knowledge of~
the fact that the heart she deemed wholly her own was
shared, with or in. the keeping of another. But in the
secret recesses of her soul, in the privacy of her chamber,
and in the darkness of tho night, when. others slept, she
unmasked her woe to the eyes of her Maker, and laid her
heart all bare. She did not pray; she could not lift up
her eyes to Him with such crimes festering in her soul.
So, "the long, long, weary days," passed in tears away,
"and' still at evening found her weeping."
On one of those dreary evenings, Kate and IRuth had
gone out driving with Colonel I-Jlartridge. Tie was trying
a pair of recently-purchased horses. Maud had made
some pretext for not accompanying them-glad to be left
alone-and sought some distraction. to her heart-sorrows
in. her~ long-neglected music.
She had played that grandest of all dirges, "Morte,"
by' Qottschalk, and still her lingers ran over and over it,
as if the weird chords could extract some of the fiery
anguish that was turning ou.t her life. But the pain each
moment grew more' and more intense, until at last, with a
low waWand hands passed over her heart, she bowed her
head upon the music-rack and sobbed aloud4
Another evening of more than two years previous will

sat weeping over the ills of life, and thinking tha er-
1'iaps, the future held in store for her the treasure o p'

As for those few, brief hours upon which she '1ook~d

"mirth of despair" ?' And they who have had
of her inner ILCe knew they were far more full f te~x's~

drew herself ~ haughtily away, and, choking back her
bursting sighs, said,
"Because I cannot~forget!-aIid~IhOldIfly5eU in utter

"Neither have I forgotten, believe nie!" he replied, in
his deep, full, rich tones, and his voice trembled, as he
added, "But it will be better for both of us I"
"What will be better?" burst excitedly from her trem.
bling lips.
"That I should be married," he answered, truthfully
and fearlessly.
Then it was true that he did contemplate marriage.
She could no longer doubt it. Sinking down upon the
stool, she buried hor face in her h~nds, and the last hope
of what might be, winged its flight from her heart, and
left it in impenetrable gloom.
There was a painful pause, a dread silence, only inter-
rupted by the spasmodic breathing of the wretched man
and woman over whom the purple vei~l of twilight was
deepening to the black of night, and~ this was broken by
~Iaud.

it might or might not be that the 4istant future held a

another's. But her reverie was soon disturbed.
"I have been ~aimo~t dragged. into this engagement,"
said the man, who, seemed but the tool of some myst&amp;
rious fate. "I~uth is a sweet little creature, ~ am willing
to confess, and byes me with all the devotion of her
nature; and, lonely wanderer that I am, I almost believe,
sometimes, she has been thrown across my way to brighten

What unprecedented vanity! As if he bad ever done
anything to merit a good turn either by the wheel of For-

A painful pause ensued, broken at length by D'Es'
taing:
"The fact is, this ~tft'aire of mine was so well managed
by both mother and daughter, I was fairly committed
before I was quite cei'tain what I was doing. You drove
tue to desperation; this child soothed me. And when it
was too late to recede, I fancied that perhaps, in a home

a more pitiable condition than the wrecked mariner on

But flQ word left her lips, though a single tear fell upon
the hand which had passionately 'grasped hers.
'~Promise nie, darling. Quick! IL hear footsteps and
voices. A moment more, and this heaven will be shut
away from my sight; it will be too late. Say that you

uine-~hat, for happiness in the marriage relation, that
relation must be based upon love alone-more cQnclusive
than ever ? Does it not teach anew that this is the only
bond iu wedlock that binds hearts indissolubly? Does it
not teach that husband and wife should be the world to
each other, with, even then, constant watchfulness, ~pra~er
in and out of season, to expel tl~o serpent from their
Eden? Love must be the chief rner-stone upon which
the altar of matrimony is consecrated. No amount of
respect, obedience, moral obligation, or social demand,
can 1111 its place.
With the sound of the merry voices in the vestibule,
D'Estaing lighted the gas, while Thud commenced play-
ing "Sans Souci Galop;" and as Kate came dancing into
the room, she cried,
"Oh, dear, you should have gone with us! We had
such a glorious drive down to 'Thunderbolt'! The

"I ~ glad you enjoyed it. Mr. ,D'Estaing, Kate."

CHAPTER XXXYL
TIlE WEDDING.
HE wedding-day had come at last, for "time and
2 tide wait for no man,~~ not even in the Forest
City.
The bride was radiant in her happiness; the forsaken
one, bowed beneath a load of guilt, walked through the
"valley of humiliation," on to the "valley of the shadow
of death;" while the bridegroom hovered between hope
and fear, and vainly endeavored to dispel the gloomy
forebodings which beset and enthralled him. Maud
shuddered, as, drawing back the heavy folds of silken
damask curtains of her chamber windows that morning,
her eyes were greeted by a lowering sky and a cold, driv-
ing mist. The sky was all white-dead white; and
minute beaded drops, like seed-pearls, rested on every
blad~ of grass, every leaf and twig, and in an icy shower
over the dark green foliage of the live oaks. A keen
north-east wind was blowing, and, as the storm increased
in fury, there. recurred to her mind, and she whispered.

249

shudderingly, "Cursed is the bride that the rain falls
on," and, turn where she would, these words rang in he~
ears, or were. written before the eyes of her spirit in let~
ters of funereal black.
Were they omino~~s of evil? Impossible! for within
the walls of the "Hermitage" everything seemed raai
ant and jQyons. Mother and daughter little heeded
the dim, leaden, white cloi~ds that draped the blue
sky, or the driving blast, or the penetrating mist, except
to regret the out-door illuminations. They were not
infected with grim superstitions nor old wives' fables;
and as the mother superintended the decorations of the
rooms and table, a smile of happy triumph lit up her aris~
tocratic face, and gave elasticity to her movements. The
daughter; buoyan~with the hopes enkindled at the altar
of her girlish devotion, made the house ring with merry
songs, while her gay laugh gushed out like the ripple of
a spring rivulet.
After a while a package arrived from him who filled
her every thought. Deeming it sacrilegious to open this
before the vulgar gaze of those passing about The house,
she ran to her own room, and, when safely locked within,
carefully opened the casket, where, displayed to her
admiring gaze, was an exquisite set of pearls and dia~
monds, elegant enough for the costly and fastidious taste
of the then petted and idolized French empress; and
with the jewels came 'a tiny card, on which was traced,
"For my little darling'"
Kissing the card because his hand had pres~d it, she
threw herself on the bed, and, placing the package be.'
ncath her pillow, soon slept the sleep which comes only
to the happy and the innocent.

patiently; his brows were contracted ~y a frown, and it
wa~ Ovident he suffe~d acutely from nervofis anxiety.
Th~ niorneuts were leaden-winged, ~
other; thought that night would never come.
Several hinidrCd invitations had been issued to the
wedding; and, as it was expected to be th~ most brilliant
affair of th~ Sdasoti, the fashionable of the city were
tillcd with pleasurabk anticipations. Night, as if to
acconinx~date the eagerness of those most nearly interest~
ed, closed in almost two hours. earlier than* usual; and
amid the clVeiiching~ r~ain which ~Vas falling, and the Egy~
tian. darkness which had thrown its midnight veil over
Nature, the guests wended their ways to the "ller
initage."
Driving up the long avenue of live oaks, whose
brandies formed the most beautiful Gothic arches, it
seemed to Matid as if the long moss, tossed back and
forth, and fitfully swayed by the storm, sobbed and
nioaned as though freighted with the refrain of some lost
and wailing s~u1, as it floated on the Stygian. Shudder-
ingslie drew further back in tho carriage, to shut out
those dreary sounds~. Colony\ Jlartridge was silent and
abstracted, and but for the sprightly conversation of Kate
and her charming escort, Captain Yates, the inmates of
that carriage might have been mistaken for pall-bearers
rather thftn wedding-guests.
The dwelling was brilliantly illuminated, and looked
like a palace of fire, shining out of the blackness ~hjch
enveloped heaven and eai~th. A large number of guests

TilE WEDDII~"G.
had already arrived, and the house was soon filled with
beautiful women and brave men, whose costumes added
a brilliance to the scene.
Maud had scarcely entered the cloak-room, when a
message came to her from Ruth, desiring her presence.
V[ith aching heart and lagging footsteps she nerved hera
selt as best she could for, this interview, this fresh ordeal,
and entered the chamber of the bride-elect.
Panoplied as she was in purity and innocence, her
1)ridal robes, in their sheen of satin and frost-work of
lace, floating around her like a snowy mist, became her
well. She looked, indeed, like a Pen wandering upon
this sin-stained earth, and in an earnestness of tone,
which betrayed not her heart-ache, Maud exclaimed;
"HoW lovelyl" Then, regarding her more closely, she
really thought ~he had ~iever seen any creature kaif so
angelically beautiful. her entrance and embrace now
served to heighten the loveliness of that chambered
tableau. The grouping 4 those three contrasting beau-
ties would have done credit to the skill and taste of an
artist.
Mingled with the pride which was revealed in the
mother's face, was a tinge of sadness which only a
mother's heart can appreciate; for it matters not how
willingly, nay, even proudly, she may relinquish her
daughter's happiness into the custody of another, though
that other be the man of her choice, it is always a sad
hour. Women know well what is before their daughters
in the relation of marriage, and they know that the duties
of wife and mother require an untold amount of patience
and endurance, no matter how much love, tenderness, and
affection soften the difficult pathway.

"Ekeuse me, will you, for sending for you?" said
Ruth, advancing to Maud; "I wish you to pin my veil
on;" and at the same time she put up her rose-bud
mouth to be kissed.
"Certainly, if you desire it; but I am sure your
mother can arrange it very much more gracefully than I
can; "-and she almost sank under the weight of this
new trial.
"But I have a particular fancy for having you do it,"
replied the wilful, artless child-woman.
"A particular fancy" for having her do it! Was the
hand of an avenging destiny in all this? Truly, "the
way of the transgressor is hard," and the ways of Provi.
dence mysterious and "past finding out"!
No longer hesitating, ~faud'took up the filmy web of
yoint applique , and with trembling fingers arranged it
with the wreath of orange-flowers over the glossy hair of
the fair bride.
As this duty was finished, an agonizing pain darted
through her heart, and, turning a pallid white, ~he pressed
both hands upon her left side, and, with a groan, sank
into the nearest chair.
"Heavens! what is the matter?" cried Thith, spring-
ing up from before her mirror, and throwing both arms
around her for support.
"It is nothing, dear Ruth," she gasped; "I am already
better "-suppressing a shriek that distorted ]~ier lips.
"My physician calls' it neuralgia of the nerves around
th~ heart; 1)ut it feels like a knife-blade piercing the
heart itself."
" But can I do nothing for you? Lie Iown, will

"And you are going.without even a word?"
Maud did not answer this remark, and Ruth, coming
nearer, put her white, soft arms about her.
"Do you not wish me something good?"
Tears stood in Maud's eyes. A briny drop sparkled
like a diamond on the bridal-veil, and, as she stooped to
kiss the white, upturned brow she whispered,
"Make him happy."
She did not trust herself to say more; but rushed from
the room, through Ruth's boudoir, down the wide stair-
way, and almost directly against the bridegroom, in her
wish to get a breath of air upon her fevered and. aching
temples. lie stood in the passage, and, seizing her hands,
cried, in evident concern,
"how deathly pale you are! Your hands are like

"What matters it if I am ? "~ she gasped, brokenly;
"I-only---~-wish I were-dead!" and, nervously extri-
cating her imprisoned hands, sh~ flew down a short pd-
vate stairway to the back gallery, where the driving wind
blew the cold mist in her face and the faintness from her
heart. Leaning thei'e upon the railing, in the midst of
the storm and darkness, she realized, more keenly than
9Ver before, her folly and her wretchedness. The river

p
growling ahd moaning, flow gladly would she at that
moment have taken the final plunge, and, beneath those
lapsing, gurgling, muttering, sighing, laughing waves,
have ended her~ miserable existence!
This unhealthy reverie was at length broken by her
husband, #ho had ~ought her in almost every room in the
house; and, while soothing her by a gentle rebuke, they*
followed the crowd that surged in to the front parlor, just
as the Right Rev. Bishop began, in tones full of
unutterable feeling, the beautiful and appropriate mar-
riage ceremonial of the Church of England.
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here, in the
eight of God and these witnesses, to join together this
man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is corn-
mended of St. Paul to be honorable among all men; and
therefore is not by any to be entered into unadvis~dlyor
lightly, but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and
iu the fear of God. Into this holy estate these two per..
eons come now to be joined. If any. man can show just
cause why they may not be lawfully joined together, let
him now speak, or else forever hereafter hold his peace."
Ther&amp; wa~ a pause; and the nervous dread which is
always experienced by the hearers at this portion of the
solemn exhortation, lest some one should appear to inter-
fere, was j~lainly visible upon the faces of those whp wit-

reptitious and inquiring glances. Suddenly, as a peal of
thunder might rumble forth when the noonday sunshine
i~ most effulgent, a strange man rushed through the crowd
like a madman, and stood by the side of the groom.
"11 can show just cause why this man and this woman
may not be htwfuily joined together. He i~ a murderer

who had followed him, De V"ere-for he it was-com~
manded, "Officers, do your duty!'~
It was evident this was a most painful duty to the
sheriff; but he, compu~ehending that the ui~ajesty of the
law must be sustained at whatever cbst, laid his hand
upon the arm of D'Estaing, and said,
"By the warrant I hAd in my hand, Mr. D'Estaing, I
arrest you.~~
"Upon what charge ~" cried D'Estaino' while grim ~
terror was writtefl upon every lineament of his face.
"Upon the charge of killing one Gustave Delamere;
and in obedience to a warrant issued by the Governor of
Georgia, on demand made by the Governor of New
York, ai~id of which J have the honor to be the bearer,"
said the second man, in whom is recognized, as lie held
aloft the terrible document, Do Leon.
The consternation produced by this interruption c~ui
better be imagined than described. Where all but a
moment before had been mirth and laughter, wit and
brilliant repartee, now reigned teif6r and confusion.
Men breathed hard, and women looked the horror that
could find no utterance in words. Had God's wrath
riven the house in twain, and descended from heaven in
a flame of fir~ in their midst, th~ dismay that took posses-
sion of the company then as~ernbled could not have been
greater. Mr. Leigh, the uncle of Ruth, and upon whose
arm she lean~c1, wa~ the first to recover self-possession,
andgrasping the arm of Dc Vere, exclaimed,
"how dare you ruffians enter this house, and, in the

man? Get out! get out! or, by the eternal God, I will
8er)d you where you deserve to go!"
"The charges are true, sir," calmly replied IDe Leon;
"and unless you instantly release IDe Vere, you may have
cause to regret it~;" and he drew and pointed a pistol.
"Release that man," quietly said iD'Estaing to Mr.
Leigh. "Put up your pistol, sir," turning to IDe Leon;
"you certainly would not dare to use it, under any cir-
cumstances, in this assemblage;" and, with one of hi~
courtliest bows, he looked around the room upon the
beautiful women and gallant men who had. gathered
there, it would seem, to witness his disgrace. A fearful
silence then ensued, broken by a whisper from D~ Vere
to the sheriff, who, with his hand upon ID'Estaiug, said,
"You are my prisoner, Mr. D'Estaing, or Mr. IDela-
mere, or whatever name you may go by."
"And I regret there is not more time for dramatics, as
we must leave by the midnight train for New York,"
added IDe Vere.
"D'E~taing," cried Mr. Leigh, "hear me!"
"For Ruth's sake, say that this horrid charge is false!~~
cried the proud mother, above the unuttered words of Mr.
Leigh, and sinking at the feet of him she importuned.
"It is false! It is false 1" cried Ruth, folding her
arms around him, as if to stay the hand outstretched for
his ruin; while her bloodless brow was knitted, and her
mild eyes, as stony as the stony eyes of Kiobo, glared
around in the sublime strength of virtuous indignation.
A very Pythoness seemed this soft, yielding, mirthful
girl, throwing the shield of her protection pver the form
of her lover, even as she knelt beside lii~ and clutched
his knees. "Who are you, that dare to bring this foul

accusation? Who are you, that would brand a spoties~
name with crime ~ Base hirelings, begone!"
Do Yore's mustache curled with the sardonic smile that
played over his lips, and a gleam of cowardly triumph
glisf cued in the cold, snaky eyes of D~ Leon. Deep
sighs were heard, and an occasional sob burst over the
apartment, but the master-feeling which ran through the
witnesses to this spectacle was one of mute surprise and
speechless horror.
"My friends," said the Bishop, his hand still clasping
the open prayer-book, "we have been strangely interrupt-
ed. I dare not proceed. May God in lli~ wisdom and
mercy soon annul this foul charge made against 'our
friend Mr. D'Estaing, while lie tempers the wind to this
poor, stricken lamb;" and, with an unuttered benedic-
tion, lie laid his hands on the heads of both Ruth and
D'Estaing.
But D'Estaing neither moved nor spoke; no, not even
to return poor Ruth's embrace. Like one petrified, he
gazed into the face of the sheriff, a cold sipile wreathing
his fine mouth, and a cold gleam, hard and chilling as
ice, glimmered from his eyes.
By this time certain of the women wept frantic, hyster-
ical tears, that shook their nerves like a prolonged and
powerful galvanic thrill, and made them as powerless as
infants.
Making his way through the crowd, Colonel Uartridge
stood beside D'Estaing. There was infinite indignation
in his glance, and a hard, metallic ring in his voice, as he
said something to the man who held the warrant; and
then, turning to his friend, said,
"JYEstaing, are the charges true?"

His ~v6rd~, though few, were so replete with anguish5
they sent a thrill of horror darting through every heart
in the room-a thrill that surcharge in a universal wai
of indignant sorrow as he locked his arms about him,
over the bowed head of poor Ruth, and shook with the
emotion of a gr~t, manly nature.
But this touching act of friendship was rudely inter.
erupted by the impatience of the law, the sheriff inform-
ing him they had no time to lose. By a superhuman
effort, D'Estaing' conquered himself. Lifting Ruth, he
drew her head on his bosom, and kissed her cold, quiver-
ing lips; then, grasping Jiartridge's. hand warmly, with
the 1&amp;&amp;uteur peculiar to his 'air and bearing, he turned to
the sheriff, and said:
"I aTh ready. Do with me according to the law."
At the~e words Ruth shrieked, and fell, as if dead, at
his feet. Stooping, and gently raising her, he pressed her
'convuulsively to his bosom, kissed her again and again
with a tenderness born on the instant, and, while she was
still insensible, laid her in her mother's arms, and fol-
lowed those commissiond to take him in custody.
It would have 1)een more than strange if imo recollec.

and way He had seen it proper to do so.

eatingg the real secret of her emotion. In, a little while
the larger portion of the gay crowd who had gathered
to the nuptials had dispersed to their several homes-the
wedding-feast untouched, the wine freezing in the ices,
the fruits decaying in their lusciousness, the flowers with-
ering in the gas-light, and the sweetmeats neglected for
palates to test their perfection.
In the grove near by, ]3onnetheau, the wretch who
should have filled a murderer's and felon's grave, and
who had been the direct cause of this strangely terrible
and disgraceful scene, having been afraid to show him-
self, joined the party in the darkness, under a feigned
name, amid, entering a carriage, they arrived in the city
just in time to take the midnight train going North.
At that hour the "IIer4~i~tage" presented a strangely
contrasting picture to thatT of the early evening. The
lights burned low; a few women-kind friends of Ruth
and her mother-with their ever-watchful, ever-faithful
servants, walked on tip-toe and whispered as if they had
been ~Vatching b'~ the cough of death; and the night

ahnos~ a bride, decked in her sacrificial garments-the
rich satin robe crushed and wrinkled, and the costly lace
veil all beset and dank with her tears. In a little closet
near by, a private sanctuary, in which she was wont to
pour 6ut the deepest and tenderest orisons that were born
in her soul, over a worn and well-used Bible the mother
knelt, and cried out in strong prayers and tears for help,
for strength; for resignation to every event of Provi..

for submission to his will; for wisdom to guide and com-

trees, and the sun's first rays gilded the leaflets of the
sturdy live oaks, and lighted up into myriads of. crystals

and daughter, clasped in each other's arms, knelt and
prayed 'together, and wept, and were in a measure
strengthened. And, many. miles distant, the shrill shriek
of a railroad-whistle aroused the slumbering passengers,

Finding himself on Centm~e street, away where the bus-
tie and din of the more thronged portions of the city
surge up like the roar of the ocean in the swelling of a
storm, a dark, gloomy edifice looms up menacingly, fore-
bodingly, before him; lie shudders as he stands beneath
its overwhelming portico, knowing that he is about to
enter that far-famed prison portentously called "The
Tombs." The name is significant, whether iii reference
to the moral death of its usual imnates, or their virtual
burial from all that is bright amid beautiful on this lovely,
God-made earth. The wretch incarccratcd in "The

having entered the cumbrous portal, one shiveringly
crosses the open court, in which is' raised, when the need
,requires, the dreadful tree of expiation, then enters an-
other iron-barred and bolted door, and scarcely a footfall
is heard as he glides along the dark, damp corridors, until
a cell is reached, in which, if his heart is not made of
stone, it must bleed for the occupant. lie does not
belong to the class in which crime is born, like the inher-
ited cancers. Gentle blood courses his veins, and the
stamp of aristocratic birth rests utpon his iioble features.
Lying at full length upon a miserable cot, his air is that
of utter dejection-a hopelessness which shuts out all
light, all life, all beauty. His complexion is pallid to
ghastliness, and the deep, dark circles around hi~ eyes
tell, more plainly thart w6rds, 'how terribly he has suf-
fered.
It has been only ten days since his Wedding-night, and
he still wears his bridal-suit, the same in which he was
arrested; but his dress is in utter disorder, and, with his
dishevelled hair, shows that he has forgotten the selfish
care of the person in the lightning-blast which has strick-

lie may be called the cause, though in a measure inno~
cent, of all the suffering with which he reproaches him-
self; for had he not abandoned the world, disdained its
necessary conventionalisms, and affected to despise the
needful restraints which are imposed on society and man-
kind?
But "they would not let me rest," he said frequently
to himself, by way of palliation. "Even when I fancied
myself most secure from intrusion, my retreat was
invaded, and I lured again and again into those haunts
for which I was so well fitted, and from which I was at
last driven by the assassin's hand." -
Thus he continued to think, and sought to derive some
consolation from what took to him the form of inevitable
destiny.
But if men excuse themselves for all their misdemean-
ors on the plea of fatality, will they be excused by the
Judge of quick and dead in the last great day? Thp
hope is like an autumn leaf driven by the hurricane;
and just so surely as that leaf is driven where it would'
not by the relentless storm, will such a hope come to
naught.
Man has Moses and the prophets, Christ and the apos~
tles; then why prate of fate and destiny?
D'Estaing was neither a~i infidel nor an atheist, but he
belonged to the popular school of infidelity which the
P~ev. iobert hall has so elaborately considered and
whose sermon on that, subject it would be well. for all to
read and study who would wrest the words of Christ from'
merely idle speculation.

Every one knows-and with pain be it written-, that it
has become quite the fashion, in these latter days, to scoff
and sneer at religion, as something of which a well-bal-
anced judgment should be ashamed.
Knowing this, as all right-thinking persons do, should
it not be the duty of every good and true citizen to put
down all such attempts, since religion is the foundation
of virtue and~ the strongest support of society; the friend
of the helpless; the sacred guardian of the marriage
rite; the faithful sentinel upon the light-house, that,
decrying dander, gives the alarm, and then throws its
protecting arms around the weary and the doubtful?
Then should not every man endeavor, by all the means
within his power, to perpetuate and spread this holy influ-
ence, this life-giving principle, to all that is good and
great; while he prays for more faith to practise what ho
professes, that he may not be a stumbling-block in the
way of the timid and unbelieving? In the words of
Lord Bacon, let it ever be remembered, that "religion is
the only thing that can teach temperance in prosperity or
heroism in adversity."
What an illustration of these precepts was D'Estaino'?
Deprived at an early age of his natural protectors, and
left to the training' of those who professed Christ only*
b
through a formula which has in it little of the true doc-
trines of Christianity, he is to be pitied~ perhaps, rather
than censured. Alas! it seems much easier to withhold
pity, than censure; and, in the solitude of his cell,
D'Estaing felt the full force of this perversion of human-
ity from natural good.
Without the influence of any divine teaching instilled
into his youthful heart, he had given unbridled license to

his passions, and they had led him first into revenge, and
then. into the indulgence of a love which his honor for~
bade, 14~t which honor alone could not restrain.
In a felon's cell, believing himself forsaken by man
and forgotten by God, crushed beneath the load of guilt
that his own conduct had brought upon his soul, in the
Cimmerian mental darkness which enveloped him, one
little spark of hope had irradiated his heart for a brief
moment; and that hope was, that his kind-hearted guar-
dian would extricate him, if possible. That hope, how-
ever, was doomed to perish with the breath that gave it
life. Upon inquiry, he was filled with pain to discover
that his guardian had closed his business in New York,
and had gone abroad for an indefinite lengtl4 of time, and
that no one could give his address.
But why did he wish to live? To what part of the
broad universe did he think to fly to escape the living
death which burned within his scorched and seared
breast?
It was the thraldom of this feeling which made him
fear to die; and yet, groping as he was in the "valley of
the shadow of death," he still trifled with the interests of
his immortal soul, and bade defiance to God and His laws.
Misfortunes proverbially soften or harden; and D'Es-
taino' wa~ fast coming under the latter unhappy proces~.
Then, as~ waking days and sleepless nights rolled by, he
asked himself continually, "Why was II born, or why so
cruel a destiny allotted to me?"
The air, as it stole in through the heavy grating, an-
swered not; there was no reply in the echoless regions
around him, and* none came from his dulled and be.
numbed conscience.

A DESEI~TED HOME.
a darkened chamber, a woman lay ill unto
death. Unconscious of pain, the delirium which
~ locked her reason was happiness; for, in the fan.
tastic visions which it fed, there came to her "the days"
that were "no more." Again they met, never more to be
parted; together, far over the seas, they wandered in
sunny and poetic climes, where even the air was laden
with love; where the flowers breathed it; where the
moonbeams nourished it; where the stars whispered it;
where fountains gurgled it; where the birds, as they nes-
tled beneath the broad lush leaves of the beauty-laden
tropics, sang it, and lived in it.
Ecstatic happiness! Infinite bliss! Would that those
dreams could have had some semblance in reality, or that
from them the soul of the dreamer might have winged
its flight to those regions where man is taught to* look for
*     the re~liz~tion of all his ideal perfection, whether of
beauty, ~ of the impulses which govern~ existence. But
it was not so. That blessed abode is only attained
~through the tribulation which purifies and refines lil:e the
goldsmith's crucible.
For three weeks Maud had dwelt in the fictitions
£
realms which grow up in the fevered brain, dulling ti~
edgQ of sorrow, the point of pain, and peopling the sidk-.
cha~nber with angels. Anon, she had roamed through
shadows, and life and death contended together in every
slender vein and pulsing artery that coursed her frames

But, as often before, when the monster brandishes hig
well-whetted sickle, he had been thrust aside, for the
wheat was not yet ripe, and the tender blade was to sinilo
again in the life-giving sunlight; though, torn by the
blast and wrenched by the whirlwind, it gladly would
have courted the cutting down.
She recovered slowly, and lived on brokenly. There
was a purpose in this. God in his infinite mercy hid
that purpose from human ken; but it was His, and in
his own season lie fulfilled it.
Kate looked pale and weary and haggard from long
watching; and a deep grief had settled on her heart,
as the revelations by the sufferer's side opened fresh pages
of life's miseries, and gave the impress of added years to
her mien and deportment.
Since the contre-tem23 of that fatal wedding-night,
little else had been talked of in the Forest City. INo
such sensation had ever been created in its social world
before; and in the hearts of the good and pious, "Ileaw
en graht that such an affair may never occur again," was
the solemn ejaculation. A gloom had been cast over the
community which seemed unlikely to be soon dispelled.
Old women, devoured by nursery recollections and absurd
superstitions, said they "knew it," "when people would
defy all signs, and wed in such a storm as was 'on that
dreary, jet-black night." Good and honest men ~lmook
their heads, and declared "it was a very sad affair-very!
very!" And some, less disposed to be generous, hugged
sweet satisfaction to their narrow souls, and avowed they
"had no sympathy with people who took up so readily
with strangers. Served them right! They would know
better in future 1"

And so the winds of rumor, and scandal, and infer
ence, and supposition, whispered or raged to little corn
fort.for those most nearly concerned.
And this one topic proved much more than "a nine
days' wonder" to the itching ears and lashing tongues of
the inhabitants, big and little, old and young; and all the
1whule Time, like a river which knows no receding flow,
rolled silently on, full-f;eighted, to the vast sea of Eter-
nity.
Amid the deep moxtiflcation consequent upon the
unhappy frustratkn of IRuth's wedding, Mrs. Leigh had
sailed for Europe-some said "never to return." Many
conjectures were ventured in refei~ence to Maud's illness,
but, on account of the high social position of her hus-
band and self, suspicions found voice only in whispers.

The sun was sinking, and the bracing air of a cool
December evening quickened the steps of pedestrians as
they sought their respective homes. I(ate sat in the em-
brasure of an oriel window which commanded a view of
the Pulaski monument and Forsyth Place;~ and many
were the familiar faces upon which she looked down from
her hiding-place, "linking fancy unto fancy," or calling
~p froimi memory scenes and associations which did not
trouble the ordinary c~iannel of her thoughts. - The satin
damask curtaimis were drawn, but. did n9t prevent a deep
groan from rcachhig her quick ear. Springing up, in an
instant she was at the bedside of the sufferer, and asked,
in the tonderest accents,
"What is it, dear?"
"Kate!"
"Yes, dear; I am 1iei~e. What will you V'

"Kate!" again whispered the weak, faltering voice,
but said no more.
"What do you wish, my dear?" said Kate, anxiously,
as she knelt by the bedside, and slipped one arm undei
the head of Thud.
Then, as if by a sudden effort-yea, almost by forco-
she asked,
"Where is my husband ?"'
Kate feared this. She trembled so that Maud felt tho
thrill, and, almost gasping for breath, replied,
"lie will be home by and by. Don't worry yourself
about him.'~.
"how many days ~hc it been, Kate, dear,? Three
fouy, live "-counting them on her thin, pale fingers-
"and he has not been near me! Why is this?"
"Tie has be~en near you," said Kate; warmly, and
blushing scarlet, she averted her face.
"has been !-but-is-----not now! What~ is the mat-
ter? What keeps him from me? Why does he not
come, Elate?" she asked again, with apprehension in her
But Kate did not answer her questions, and looked so
confused, that what had been the most harrowing sus-
picions since her husband's protracted absence began
now, in Maud's mind, to assume the form of some terrb
lAo reality. Was it the consciousness of having done him
a great wrong that filled her mind with fears mingled
with dread? Who can doubt it? Self-accusing moments
come to every one; and if, in those honest hours, men
would humble themselves in the dust, and ask for guide
arice of God, they might in future years 100k back to
their dark days as clouds which hide "the silver lining."

The silence had grown painful, and Maud, raising her.
s44f on her elbow, determined to know the worst.
"Kate, you are unnecessarily embarrassed. What is
the cause of it?"
"Nothing," ~said Kate, with a sigh.
"You are concealing something from me, I fear. Pray
do not keep me in suspense. I have borne much; 1~ can
bear yet much more. Tell meif you know, where my
husband is."
Her voice was calm, but her pulse throbbed wildly,
and still Kate knelt by her side with bowed head, and
made no reply.
To be the bearer of ill news is ever, to the sensitive
mind, a most revolting task, and one from which even the
hardened are wont to shrink, unless there is pleasure
found in the tortures of the rack; but life imposes pains
as well as pleasures; and the true and good dare not
sometimes falter in the performance of duty, when it
requires the excision of a nerve, the probe, or scalpel,
simply because of their nervous sympathy.
"Kate; why are you silent?" said Maud.
At last, fully realizing tl~at silence was no longer either
possihie or merciful, Kate raised her head, and said,
deprc~atingly:
"Maud, dear, I have a letter f~r you."
"A letter!" cried Maud, again raising herself in her
bed ; "give it me! Quick! quick, Kate! A letter?"
Taking it from her pocket, she placed it in eagei',
tre~nbling hands, and, not wishing to be a witness to the
coining agony of her friend, turned and left the room.

"Excuse me, if I refrain from saying, 'My dear wife,'
as I would. You have forfeited tour right to that con
sideration. During your illness, you have made, in
delirium, such disclosures as will render it impossible for
us ever to live together again as man. and wife. If I
have not been as demonstrative as others, my manner, and
not my heart, was in fault. God in heaven knows how
deeply I have loved you. I do not censure, for I am
aware I am neither attractive nor fascinating; but to ren~
der y6u happy, and in every way comfortable, has been
the aim of my wedded life. In that I have failed, you
are blameless; but this sudden awakening from perfect
security, and what Ii fancied was happiness, has undone
me. In the hands of Mr. Broughton I have left a sufi[

you live. The home in which I thought myself among
the happiest of men, is yours. May God bring you that

As she finished reading, the note dropped from her
lingers; bcad~d drops of cold perspiration stood upon her
temples, and her teeth chattered in her month.

to herself, "I could have told him all-hog I suffered-~

the dust before him, and pleaded forgiveness. He might

But it was too late. She was as utterly alone as a
wrecked mariner on the smallest isle in mid-ocean. God
alone knew whether they should ever meet again, and her
sighs and tears He alone took account of.
Several hours dragged their slow length along. As she
lay there, sobbing hysterically, her penitence was worthy
of the cause which called it forth.
But love is stronger than revenge, inasmuch as it en~
twines within it the blessed promptings of piety; and
soon her thot!ghts, untrammeled by discretion, ran out to
~the one who at that moment languished in a dungeon.
Did she love him still, with the crime of a homicide
clinging to his soul? Aye, and more tenderly, in the
very waywardness of woman's nature, than ever! Ilad
&amp;he no pride? Pride is insane beside the strength of
woman's love-such love as Maud's, that would fatten
even on the vapors of disgrace. It mattered not; she
loved him, though the gyves and manacles were the jew-
elry that clanked on his wrists and ankles. She loved
him then; she would love him till her latest breath.
Toward midnight, Kate entered Mand's chamber to
resume her post as watcher, but they exchanged not a
single word. To each the past was a closed book.
By strictly ~following the directions of her physician,
MIaud's health improved more rapidly than could have
been expected; so that, at the expiration of two weeks,
she sat up, and, with the assistance of Kate's supporting
arm, walked about her husband's beautiful and forsaken
home.
Kate's love, kindness, and sympathy shone out to he3

like stars in the midnight of her woe; but no confidences
were exchanged, and a melancholy, which seemed too
heavy to break, settled on both of these bright young
women.
Two weeks later, at the darkest hour of the night, a
muffled figure might have been seen stealthily leaving
that house. The silence of the hour was scarcely broken
by the soft tread; and, taking a carriage, the disguised
figure was driven rapidly to the nearest station of the
Central Railroad, while little thought was given to the
deserted house left behind in the gloom of night.

attracted more than usual attention as she
walked hastily along the crowded thoroughfares
of New York. Totally unconscious of the admiring
glances which were bent upon her, her every thought wa~
of one who lay immured within the walls of a dungeon;
and how to gain access to him, puzzled, her brain, until
she was almost crazed. Having arrived in this great
metropolis the day before, she considered herself £ortm.
nate in seciiiring board very near the prison. Why she
congratulated herself upon this circumstance, is still a
mystery, for, in reality, it brought her no nearer the
object of her search.

desolation be imagined? In the solitude of the primeval
forests, isolation would not have been more complete;
but Maud's world now consisted of her thoughts alone,
and they were confined, as is, already known, to one soli-
tary being~.. An insane desire to rescue him from the
hrn~ribIe fate which evil presentiments forced upon her
excited imagination, had taken possession of all her facul-
ties. How to do it, or in what manner to proceed, had
not yet been developed. In one of those mad impulses
which sometimes urge both men and women to deeds
before undreamed of, she had abandoned friends, and
home, and yielded to the blind dictates of a guilty pas-
sion, which had brought only misery in the past, and
which her heart told her too surely would bring ruin in
the future. Who can account for such infatuation?
And where it shall end, who is prophet enough to pre-
dict?
Sitting in her room, which commanded a view of the
prison, she had done absolutely nothing but watch the
g~boomy building which held 'the object of her thoughts.
Once she had ventured to walk past it; then, as if acci-
dentally entering into a conversation witli a policeman,
* 'she learned, to her sorrow, that no one was allowed to see
him.
It was the day of his trial,' and with beating heart she
read the announcement in. the morning papers. An
intense excitement prevailed throughout the city. Every
~v~nue leading~o the old Court-House on Chambers
street was blockaded with people and vehicles; and as
the living stream still poured in that direction, iMlaud was
carried along with it, until she was in danger of being
eri~shad.

It had been noised abroad that the Prosecuting party
would attend t~ie trial en~ mct&amp;~e, and a vulgar curiosity,
common to the human race, assembled a large concourse
of people in the Temple of Justice that morning. Halls,
galleries, 'stairways, and windows were packed with ~a liv-
ing, breathing hiass. Iflut IMlaud's heart sank, as a neigh.
boring clock told the hour of eleven, and the entrance
was as far off as it had been an hour previous. The trial
was announced to begin at ten; and while she was
indulging these thoughts, the jury filed in and took their
seats, and all eyes were turned upon the prisoner, who
entered at the same hioment. For some reason not
divulged, D'Estaing had persistently refused to employ
counsel, although he knew that in the hands of his guar-
d~an he must have an. ample fortune. Hence, counsel
had been assigned him by the State, which thereby
proved its desire to be merciful as well as just. his
defenders had visited and consulted with him, but his
statements were meagre, the conferences unsatisfactory,
and their interest in him not what it might have been
under different circumstances.
lie was pale ~nd haggard, but bore with calmness the
storm of glances that were levelled at him as he took the
appointed seat. The case was called, and, just as the
charge was about ~to be read, there was a sudden cra~i-~--
the girder that supported the gallery snapped in twain,
and its pi'ecious freight of hundreds of human souls was
precipitated on to the floor of the court-roon~ below, all
of which gave way, carrying within its last embrace the
eager, curious beings who ~i~d gathered tkere to look on
the misery of one of their fellow~creatures.v

Great God! what a day of horror of misery, of woe,
of untold wretchedness, was that!
it was done so quickly that no one at first comprehend.
ed what had occurred. iMlaud was now 'within the hall
which led to the court-room, but a blinding, suffocating
dust was all that she was conscious of, until some one
near her said,
"Great God! the court-room has fallen in!"
She did not shriek or faint, but went with all haste to
one of the doors of the gallery. As she stood on the
brink of destruction, looking doWn upon the mangled,
bleeding, dying beings in the pit below, an insane desire
to cast herself into their midst and end her wretchedness
came over her. The temptation grew stronger each min-
ute, and, but for a kind-hearted fireman, might have been
put into execution. Jerking her back, he said,
"See, the floor is giving way under your feet!"
"It matters not."
"Would you kill yourself?"
"I would."
"Have you friends there ?"
" One."
"Come to the square, then, where they are making
preparations to extricate the bodies, and perhaps you will
lind him."
Following this strange man out on to the square, a
scene met her eyes which baffles description. Fire-bells
were ringing, church-bells were tolling, the firemen
those ~gallant fellows, who are ever foremost in the ranks
of dariger-were busy in their efforts to relieve the suffer-
ors; the military and police were doing all that human
power could do; mothers* sisters, wives, and children,

rent the air with their shrieks; fathers, sons, and broth.
ers hurried to and fro in a manner which betokened
frenzy and despair; and the final day will scarcely be
fraught with more horror, when the last farewells are
spoken, and the greedy flames clasp in their cruel em,
brace the forms of loved ones, and take them from 'sight
forever.
Standing near the spot where the bodies were swung
down, Maud saw the disappointment of relatives when
the missing one came not to greet their streaming eyes.
11cr sympathetic heart was touched, and the tears, which
had refused to flow for the last month, now came to her
relief.
While this scene was being enacted outside, the tragedy
was deepening within that pit of human slaughter. The*
dust from the plastering was blinding, and no man could
recognize his neighbor. The groans of, the wounded and
the prayers of the dying were enough to have melted
hearts of stone; and the refinement of cruelty was there
exemplified, for iio man could assist himself or help his
friends. The timbers were still creaking and crashing,
and the consternation increased with each moment, as
minutes lengthened into hours, and so many, who might
have been saved, died for want of time and assistance.
At length, from out that chaotic mass of ddlris, a voico
caine as from the dead, and said,
"My friend, can you move a little?"
"Heavens! that voice!" exclaimed D'Estaing~
"My God! Delamere, is it you?"
"it is Bonuethean; and I cannot i~ove hand or foot,
for a beam has fallen across me."
Thus these two men, persecutor and victim, were equal

at last, for death equalizes all mankind. They wouki
have been more than human not to have thought of the
past; and to their honor be it recorded, that all animosity
'vvas forgotten. D'Estaing bore no malice; aiid as il3onne-
thean fclt that his last hour was approaching, he said,
penitently, and in a weak voice,
"~Can you forgive me?"
"IL can, and do; and may God forgive you as freely
and fully!" was the quick response.
"That-4s-too much-to-expect 1" said l3onnetheau,
in broken accents. Then, after a littTh while, he said,
feebly, "Farewell!" and no more was heard of him until
his name was announced among the dead.
D'Estaing had received some slight wounds, but, in the
excitement of the hour, was not aware of it. At length,
however,,he turned deathly ~ick, and soon after fainted
from physical exhaustion and loss of blood.
For hours Maud stood upon the greensward watching
this terrible tragedy in all its sickening detail, and still
she watched and waited until the day was gone and night
came on, and still the form she sought was missing. At
last, anxiety, suffering, hunger, fatigue, thirst, and sleep-
lessness conquered, and she fell fainting upon the square.

Awaking to consciousness~ several hours afterwards, sh~
found herself in one of those blest abodes where veiled
~vonien move softly around doing good. The walls of the
little room were white as purity itself,, and thorough neat-
ness was written upon all its simple appointxnznts. It
was near midnight, and a shaded lamp threw a subdued
light over everything, but the peace which reigned within
t1w~t chamber was a stranger to Maud's he~4; and, as a

weary sigh escaped her lips, a gentle woman glided noi~e(
lessly to her side, and said,
"I hope you are better?"
"Better? "-and passing her hand over her brow, as
though not understanding, asked, vacantly, "Who are
you?
"~istor Agnes."
"Where am I?"
"In the Convent Qf St. Madeleine."
"And where is that?" asked Maud, a~ if~ oblivious of
what had occurred.
"In New York."

and pressing her hands to her brow, as if to recall her
wandering thoughts.
"Yes, in New York. Do you not remember-4'
J3ut she stopped suddenly, as if afraid to go. on with the

Maud's mind seemed still bewildered, as she asked, iii

as she awaited ~n answer.

"She has just left me, and, as she is so much fatigued,
begged not to be disturbed, unless it was something very
urgent. You can see her in the mornincr"
"But I must be gone with the early dawn.".
"Gone where?"
"To where duty calls me."
"Our first duty is to take care of that life which God
has given us, so that we. may thereby fulfil the mission
for which each one of us is ordained."
"My first and paramount and only duty is to one I
love*; and I must hasten, or it will he too late."
".De~ar lady, that is an earthly passion, and should be
uprooted from your heart, wherein should be implanted
alone the love of Christ and the advancement of his
kingdom." And as this gentle woman ceased speaking
she bent her brimming eyes upon the floor, her bosom
heaved with excitement and paiu~hl emotions, as she
remembered that a love misplaced and betrayed had sent
her to seek consolation within those cloistered walls.
Being too~ much occupied with her own thoughts to

of abstraction, Maud said,
"how does Sister Madeleine gain access to the pris~

"We are never refused admittance anywhere. But do
Lry and go to sleep now, and you will be better in the

morning. I will be in the adjoining room, and if yoi~
need anything, just ring."
With, these words she kissed Maud's brow, and went
softly out.
Maud could not sleep, and with the early morning she
was stirring, although vcry weak. Soon after, and much
against the wishes of Sister Agnes, she left the Convent,
and wended her footsteps' in the direction of her thoughts.

* death to all who came under his fatal influence. But a
few hours previous he had begun to feel reconciled to the
prospect of dying-of expiating his many offences against
God and man-and had prayed that all the fatal love
which had been bestowed upon him might be turned into
hate. He thought perchance he might be forgotten-or,
better, his memory scorned, and he felt infinite gladness
in the thought. But now, out of the comforting depths
of woe, he was suddenly, mysteriously, and unexpectedly
recalled to life, and love, and the world, upon whose
mimic boards he had played a tragic part, had walked a
shadow, a wretched thing of no substaiice; and all this
came back to him with fresh charms, fresh temptations.
Insidious as was the syren tongue which lured him back
to love, and life, he stubbornly refused to listen to its
seductive music; and to his honor be it said, his only
thought now was, how he. might restore this deluded
woman to home, husband, and friends. To die, he was
determined; he was sick at heart of the misery which
ever followed in his footsteps, like the pC5tihMiCC which
comes with the East wind. If he fid influence Maud
to return to her home-to forget aiid hate him-he would
feel that he had not lived altogether in vain.

his coarse repast. it failed to toml)t his famishing tlionrh

Soon after, Sister Madeleine made her daily visit. She
was informed that her services would be no longer need~
ed ~ and besides, as his trial would begin on the follow
ii~ day~. he. might not be permitted to receive visitors.
"As~ou wish, sir," said this gentle woman * "but if II
1

cannot visit yon, I will never cease to pray for the wel
fare of your soul."
"Your kindness is beyond what I deserve," said D'Es~
taing, remorsefully,~ "and, could I bend my unworthy
knee in prayer, it would be to ask the heavenly Father to
reward you for all your goodness to a lonely, wretched,
but not ungrateful luau;" and, pressing her hand to his
lips, lie did utter an acceptable ejaculation to God as she
glided from his presence.
The day wore away slowly, wearily, to two hearts.
While the one thought only of the coming meeting, the
other thought of how this woman, who had~ suffered so
much, had perilled so much, might be restored, unscathed
by seaiidal, to her abandoned home.
Then new difficulties arose as doubt was added to hope.
lie feared that what lie would accomplish was simply an
impossibility. how could a woman who had voluntarily
forsaken her home ever be induced to return to~ it?
There was so mnni~h to be forgiven, so many concessions
to be made, so much to be endured; and even if. the hus~
band and wife shon be reconciled under such circum~
stances, would not t ghost of other days ever be rising

1i~ieuse served but to enhance her refined, spiritual love
lines.
It was well for her that the dense population of the
city were altogether too self-occupied to take notice - of
her movements, or she might have been arrested in her
mad undertaking. At her boarding-house she had made
herself known as Mrs. hall, and her quiet, unobtrusive
manners would have silenced all suspicion, even granting
any had existed.
Walking rapidly, she was soon at the entrance of the
prison. The warden at first refused, and finally, with
great reluctance, admitted her, only satisfying his con-
science by attending her, himself until another was met,
who conducted her to the cell of the prisoner.
When the door creaked on its heavy hinges, Maud was
fearful of a scene which might be tray her, and thwart
the cherished purpose concealed within the hidden depths
of a woman's ingenuity. And it was with the utmost
difficulty that she controlled herself, as D'Estaing, spring-
ing forward, seized both of her hands in his, and in an
exci&amp;d and tremulous tone, whispe~' d,

"May God in heaven," he cried, profiting by hei hint,
"bless all those who make this cell radiant with their
presence!"
"Do not think of* that just now. Kneel with me, and
let us offer up a silent prayer,. that strength may be given
you sufficient to your present need."

Kneeling side by. side in that dark, sombre cell, ~
kind of painful rapture thrilled those two misguided and
guilty beings, as they prayed indeed to the great Alk.
Father.
The prayer was strengthening, sustaining. it was with
reluctance that they arose from their knees. The mois~
ture that covered the jailor's eyes like a film of fine glass,
showed that a spark of tenderness, even in his heart, had
survived the callousness that grows out of familiarity
with criminals. His feelings were wrought up to un-
comfortable tension. lie was glad when'* the prayer
ended.
Saying a hasty "good-by," Maud flew along ~he streets,
until she again reached the train of cars upon which she
had conie down, and in a little while, in her own room,
was reading the following note, which had been slipped
into her hand as she was rising from her prayer in the
prison-cell :
"My God! Max~d, why have you followed me here?
But to make misery more miserable ?-to tempt me back
to the life I shall resign most willingly? l~eturn, I
implore you, to your husband, friends, and home! Go
back, I entreat you, before it is too late! Know that I
do not wish to live. I have determined to die. If not
by the hand of the law, in some other way I shall end
this wretched life. It has been nothing but a curse to
me-a curse to others. Not even can you tempt me to
live; and I scorn to be rescued by any power save that
of natural death. Forgive me, if you can, for the past;

edly will your reputation, and can do me no good. Fare.
well, forever!"
She pondered. Was it for this, then, she had left her
home, sacrificed her fair fame, risked, the loss of her
immortal soul? Bitterer than the waters of Marah were
the tears which flowed from her eyes upon reading this
note~ ~he then fully experienced what it was to bo for-
saken by both God and man.
"Alone!" she cried; "alone! alone! ~
Truly she was alone, in the great, heartless, heaving,

ILE trial had been resumed, and was being prose-
cuted with all the energy of which ~ well-paid
court is capable, and all the vigor, all the rigor,
which hatred or revenge could inspire.
The late fatality had somewhat chastened and subdued
the ardor of the public, and the temporary court-room
was not so much crowded as the judicial chamber had
been ~upon the opening day of the trial However, there

were many more or less interested present, and they were
a motley gang of men and women, representing all class
es, ages, and conditions.
To a close observer, there was no difficulty in distin.
guishing between the friends and the enemies of the
prisoner. Perhaps, for "friends," the term "sympa-
thizers" would be better; for the unfortunate man was
an entire stranger in the city, and could claim but a
single friend, who had dared everything, braved every-
thing, deserted everything, to attest the strength of that
friendship.
human nature often presents strange contradictions, as
well as odd intermingling of good and bad; and there
is no greater evidence of the truth of this assertion, than
is to be found in the sympathy that one supposed to be a
martyr excites.
Without claiming for D'Estaing the character and
position of a martyr, he was a lonely man, without
friends or influence, "a stranger in a strange place," and
persecuted by a horde of man-shaped vampires with a
malici6usness which would have distinguished a set of
barbarians. Seeing and knowing this, as the publi~ did,
i~i fact, the hearts 'of many strangers were moved to. coin-
passion for the crrino ina~~, while at the same time they
deeply condemned the dcccl with which he was charged.
Generally, men endeavor 'to hide their best feelings
from the world; so these sentiments in behalf of D'Eg-
taing were only acknowledged in their own souls, and
brought no relief to the prisoner in his hour of need, for
whatever would be effective imist be active.

There were traces of great beauty still visible in the
woman's face, although' dissipation had impressed its'
* stamp upon it, and a restlessness of the eyes and a nerv-
ous manner betokened a conscience ill 'at ease.
With a rapidity and correctness which is only known
* to women through their ready intuition, Maud' felt confi-
dent, without being informed, that this woman was Ehise
Daponte. She was instantly surrounded by a ni~mber of
flashily-dressed and dissipated-looking men, ~and soon was
engaged in apparently as gay and amusing a conversation
as if in a ball-room, instead of a hall of justice, where
the life as well as the reputation of a man had been
thrown in the scales.
Maud was a silent witness of this harrowing scene,
from behind the heavy crape veil drawn over her face;
and although the trial was proceeding with much more
than the usual interest and excitement, she saw nothing,
aud heard nothing but the sneers and innuendoes, the.
careless jest and heartless repartee, from the wicked per-
secutors of the man she would save. At length, when
her feelings could no longer endure this terrible torture,
~he made a quiet exit from the court-room, and, gain-
ing the streets, wandered about in an aimless and pur-
poseless manner, until entire physical exhaustion drove
he~ to seek her own room.

The shop-windows with all their tempting brilliance,
the dry-goods palaces with all their gorgeous appoint.
meuts, the gayly-dress~d promenaders, the costly equi-
~agcs with their burden of beautiful and fashionable
women, had no attraction for her gaze. In all the wide
world there was but one face, one figure, that then had
part in her thoughts. And this face and this figure
belonged to the prisoner on trial for his life. One idea
alone absorbed her, and that was, how the life of this
prisoner, might be clutched from the hands of the execu-
tioner.~~~show his body, to her the impersonation of all that
was perfect ift physical manhood-might be rescued from
the allowsw' in a word how she mi~ht contrive to save
D'Estaing.
Waking or sleeping, it was ever with lici'; and some-
times, in the still hours of the iiight, she would spring
from her couch in horror, as her morbid imagination con-
j ured up in dreams the frightful gibbet with its dangling
victim. In such visions she saw his pale face, his blood-
shot eyes, his quiverin, lips; and, the awaking to know
they were but dreams, was but the awaking to know that
the l)ictlll'es seemed destined to be real. And in the soil-
tiude of her little chamber she made the nights pitiful
with her wails, her sobs, her sighs; and in the midst of
this agony she would cry:
how long, 0 iLord, how long!
At the ~ppoimitcd hour she visited the "Tombs," but
was altogether unprepared for the new trial which await-
ed her.

~was on his countenance, when he extended his hand and
bade her "good evening."
"I am very sorry, Sister Madeleine," said he, "to refuse
you admittance to the prisoner, but I have received posi.
tive instructions to let no one see him wader any circurn-
stances."
She was overcome at this unexpected stroke of misfor-
tune, and, sinking into a chair, groaned in agony of
spirit. She was, indeed, naturally a timid woman, and,
never having been called upon to act for herself, was not
more courageous than inexperienced. But when the
object of a woman's love is threatened, brain and heart
quickly act in concert, and instantly suggest some plan of
relief.
Throwing back her veil, she looked up into the ward-
en's face. '~ I am no Sister of Charity," said she. "Look
at me-I am a 8?~?ering woman. here is gold for you.
If you will permit me to see the prisoner instantly and
alone, this sum shall be doubled, trebled-yes, even quad-
rupled." And when she ceased speaking, she trembled
* from, anxiety and suspense.
* Seizing *the dainty, golden-fringed, ~ill~en purse, the
eyes of the jailor sparkled as he opened jt, and counted
fifty bright gold eagles.
"V/eli, now, that's ~ot very bad 1" he said. "This
much money isn't easily made every day. But-let me
see! Let-.--me-5CC!" lie stroked his shaggy beard,
and frowned, and looked down to the stone floor, as if
there might be something on its smoothly-worn, flinty
face, to enlighten him between avarice and duty.
"Do ~not keep me long in suspense, L pray you 1" cried
Maud, imjatiently.

"Come, now; don't get in too big a flurry!" said the
sailor, with an air of authority, and as if he would like
to have said, "You are in my power." "It's no light
matter, this way of being swung up just to ~gratify some
fine lady's whim. I've got to get rid o~ the guard in
some way, for they know of this order; but how to do it,
is not such an easy thing."
"how many are there? " asked Maud.
"Only one-the one that walks in front of his celL"
"Oh, that is easily done!" said IMaud. "Send him
off on an errand."
"Well, I declare!" ex~daimed the jailor, a grim smile
lighting up his coarse, hard features. " It took a woman
to find out the forbidden fruit, and the truth is, they huve
been in so much devilment ever since, that they under-
stand getting out of Scrapes as ~vell as most other people
do getting into thefi~. I'll do as you suggest; so, just sit'
down and make yourself easy until I clear the ~eoast, and
I'll be back."
Locking the door, he hurried himself away, and,
although the time seemed well-nigh an age to Maud, his
work was quickly done. IReturning for her, she followed
him, with a quickly-beating heart, through the dark, cold,
narrow galleries, and, unlocking, he pushed her rather
rudely into the prisoner's cell.
"When I rap three times, come out instantly," said he,~
hurriedly.
Once within the cell, she had to stand a minute or two
before she could proceed; but, thanks to the kindness of
a struggling moonbeam which just then stole through the
grating, she discovered the object of her search lying on
his coarse couch.

By his deep aftd steady breathing she fancied he must
be sleeping; and, advancing noiselessly and bending ovem
him, she found that her surmise was correct. Kneeling
beside him, she offered up to Heaven a prayer of thank-
fulness; and raising his hand, which was thrown out over
the edge of the conch, pressed it to her lips.
lIe was instantly awakened; and as the moonlight fell
4full upon her face, a cry of delight burst from him, and
springing up, he clasped her convulsively to his bosom.
"Maud! Maud! how came you here? Or is tl~is only
a phantom come to mock me? Is it a dream?"
holding her off at arm's length, he scrutinized her
'closely.
"It is not a dream," she whispered. "It is I-it is
Maud!"
"But why do you linger here?" he exclaimed. "bid
I not implore you, in my letter, to return to those whom
you have deserted for me? Go! go, I beseech you,
before it is too late, for it can bring you only misery and
death to cling to me."
"Misery and death, with you, Alphonse, are preferable
to happiness and life without you," ~he said, with assumed
calmness.
"I wish you did not love me!" said he, as he pushed
back her hood and kissed her cold, sorrow-seamed bi'ow.
"Why do you wish this? "
"Because it makes it so hard to die," he replied, with
a shuddering groan.
"l3ut you shall not die! You must live!" were the
agonized exclamations that burst from her heart.
"how can that be?" he asked, quickly.

"Lscape to what?" he cried, eagerly.
" To life."
"V~Til1 you fly with me? Will you live with me2
Yf ill you be mine?" he asked, excitedly, holding her
face up to the moonlight, as if to read his answer in its
tell-tale looks. "If so, we will fly to-night-now I My
wealth by this time must have increased largely. We
will find my former guardian somewhere, and the 'wide,
wide world' sh~ll be our home. Only say the word, and
we will seek some little spot of earth, some lone island,
where we shall be all in all to each other, and where our
only ambition shall be to outvie each other in loving.
Say the word, my love, my life, and we will go!"
11cr head had sunk upon his breast; tears were pour-
ing down her cheeks, and God-the God of mercy and
all goodness-oiily knows how fiercely she wrestled with
her heart to resist the temptation of tlia~ hour. 11cr low
sobs were her only response, as, raising her head, he
looked steadily in her face, and said,
"You are silent-you weep. have you no answer for
me?" Still not a word escaped her lips. "Will you be
mine? Will you go, or not? Answer me, Maud! Now,
or never!"
The agony of her tortured heart found expression in
the pale and distorted features of her face. She looked
up, and, in a broken voice, replied,
" I cannot ! "
The next instant he threw her from him. Sh~~ laid~
prostrate and weeping on the dungeon-~~r, while he
fiercely strode from one end to the other of his narrow

"You have never loved me. My death be upon youm
head!"
A fresh groan burst from her, and in tears she implored
him,
"Recall those cruel words!"
"As God lives, they are true. Here I was alone,
deserted, and content-yes, eager-to die. You came,
with all your soft blandishments, and wooed me back to
life and love. What are life and love, without you?
And when I ask you to be to fly with me-what
is your answer? 'I cannot!' Go, poor deluded womaii,
and leave me as you found me!"
"Oh, Alphonse*!" she cried, in agony, "God knows
that my love is as fathomless as the ocean, and as limit-
less as space itself; but Ii cannot commit the crime to
which you urge me."
"In the eyes of the world you are already gu~ty," he
said, with stinging reproach.
"But in the eyes of God I am not guilty." And as
she cast her eves heavenward, moved by an irresistible
impulse, D'Estaing knelt by her side, and, in the unut-
tered prayer that went up to the throne of the Eternal,
they knew that they loved more madly, more hopelessly,
more recklessly, t~han ever before.
Three raps upon the iron door of the cell startled them..
"Who is it?" said D'Estaing.
"It is the signal tha1t I must leave you; but do not let
us part in anger."
"No, dearest," he said; "we will not." Then folding
her closely to his heart, "Forgive me, my earthly angel
all my angry words, all my ipapatience."
"Freely and fully.~~

The raps were repeated.
"When will you come again?"
"As soon as possible." And with these words sh~
slipped out of the open door, out into the dimly-lighted
corridor out into the wretchedness of her Ioneliness-het
absolute loneliness-out into streets with her sick and
weary heart-with her l)enumbed conscience, her weak
despised self; hungry for light, hungry for the sympathy
for which her soul would have endured eternal loss before
it would have asked it from the world, that jostled her at
cvery turn, and Jreathed even in her ear.
As she hurried with the jailor along the' dark passage
that leads from the open court of expiation, he told her
he must say something more to her, and led her into a
small private room.
"It will be im~ossib1e," he said, "for me to do this
sort of thing every night. I am afraid I shall ~be dis~
covered. But if you will agree to pay me well, I can
manage so that you shall get to see him once or twice a
week at least-say, for instance, Monday and Thursday
mo'htS "
"You are very kind and considerate," said Maud. "I
shall pay you well, rest assured."
"%u must come, then," said he, in an undertone,
"about eight, or half-past eight o'clock."
"Very well, then. I shall be here without fail on
Thursday night."
"And don't forget the gold," he chuckled, as the heavy
door closed behind her, and the lights from the street-
lamps fell upon her almost blinded eyes.

to her temporary home. Upon reaching her chamber~
she threw herself upon her bed, but not to sleep. From
side to side she tossed, her heavy sighs alone relieving the
surchargings of her misQry; and when the morning sun
light crept in through the bars of her window-shutters, it
saw her still in her serge dress; while her pale face and
tear-stained eyes told the tale of despair which dwelt in
her breast.
CHAPTER XLII.
UNDER THE GAS-LIGHT.
HE 8aldns of Monsieur Duponte had never been
more brilliant and attractive than on the night
referred to. The playing had been reckless
beyond conception, and several, who had entered those
doors with princely fortunes, had departed penniless and
Wretched.
The coalition of Duponte and De Yore had been suc~
eessfui, far exceeding their most sanguine expectations;
but Elise was reserved ai~d melancholy. Do Yore in
vain attempted to divine the cause. The godless life she
had led was groxvin~ sickening. Vice and remorse were
ploughing deep furrows across her once smooth brow, and
a close observer might have told, by her startled and
nervous manner, that the same cankering and corroding
causes were eating into her vitals, and saPping even the
life from the heart.
"Why so pensive and silent, mcs ch~e ? "~ said Dc

Were, as they lingered alone, and he pressed her to hi~
heart.
"I am weary and heart-sick," she answered, as the.
giving ghost of misspent days and a wasted life rose up
before her.
"Weary df what, my love?" asked he, tenderly.
"Weary of the life Ii am leading-.-of the life II have
led; weary of life itself, disgusted with my acts, and
heart-sick at their consequences." And tears, which had
been long-oh, how long V-a stranger to the eyes of this
reckless and relentless woman, forced their crystal drops
through her slender jewelled fingers aiW fell upon the
diamond brooch that confined a colla~ of rarely rich
pQint d'A1en~on~ around her proudly arching threat, to
the bodice of her velvet robe.
"Why, Elise, you astonish, me!" exclaimesl De Vere.
"What! tears in the eyes of the rich, handsome~ hAl.
liant, envied Elise Duponte?" And, drawing still more
closely to her, he applied a delicate cambric mouckoir
her eyes, with gentle words and multiplied caresses.
She withdrew the handkerchief with a gesture of iiu~
patience, as if the perfume which scented its folds nause-
ated her.
"Let them flow!" she cried. "They relieve the
oppression here "-laying her hand upon her heart.
"You are only a little nervous to-night, m~s petite~
You are wearied by all this heavy' work. Go to year
room, dearest. I am sure a good night's rest will quite
restore you"

mere is ever before me, as well as that of his cousin now
languishing in that dungeon. I am pursued by spectres,
who grin upon me, and whisper, 'Murder! Revenge!
And this fascinating~.demoness, who now began indeed
to feel the whip of conscience in its most torturing lashes,
buried her fac6 in her hands to shut out the haunting
sights conjured up from her evil deeds.
~' Oh, Elise, this is all stuff-sheer nonsense!" cried
iDe Mere, in a petulant tone, though he looked perplexed
somewhat, as he added: "I cannot permit you to behave
in this excited manner. You make yourself ill. These
fears are childish, and unworthy a woman of your indoin
table spirit."
"Be they childish, womanly, or what you may please
to esteem them, they must also come to you some day;
for I, Elise Duponte, do tell you this night, that the con-
science implanted in us by God, through which we may
be enabled to distinguish between right and wrong, it
matters not by what means w~ may crush and subdue its
chiding for a while, will make itself heard at last, and
then " The sentence was concluded only by a fresh
burst of tears.
"Elise! Elise, you know not how you distress me!"
cried iDe Mere.
"And I shall distress you still' more!" she exclaimed,
vehemently. "I tell you, you must and dw&amp;1l rescue
Delamero from the gallows!"
"Impossible I" cried De. Mere, in utter amazement.
"Nothino in this life is impossible!" she cried, imupi-
ousl~, "where gold is plentiful; and I swear to you,
sooner will I die, and by my own hand, than have that
man's blood added to the load of guilt on my soul."

"Ask anything in reason, Elise, and I wilVgrant your
request," he said, calmly; "but I cannot grant impossi.
bihties."
"Impossibilities! Empty your coffers; drain them to
the last dollar; buy up counsel; bribe the jury and the
prosedution-~Q~2l men have r rice and you have
money enough to do all this. If this appear impossible,
buy the wardens of the prison, if it should take the last
dollar of qui' ill-gotten wealth, and set D'Estaing free.
Then I promise to be your slave----~your abject slave, if
you wish, for life-aud help you to make thousands more.
We can soon refill our empty chests-can we not, dear
Alfr~de?" she said, with tender blandishment-a look of
mock humility softening her eyes as she gazed into the
depths of his own for a reply.
He answered, slowly, "It is now utterly beyond my
power to avert the course of the law. By your commands
the counsel and jury have already been purchased and per-
jured. What would they think of me, were I to ask them
to change now? One day y~u demand the man's life;
the next you ask that he shall~ be set at liberty. ~It is too
late now. You must abide th~ consequences."
"Were their fees doubled, or trebled, they would ask
no questions," she said, dog~dly. "And I tell you,
AIfr6de De Mere, that I, and I alone, should pay the
penalty of the death of Gustave iDelamere. Yes, I was
his murderess; and I would to God the same dagger
which pierced his heart had ended also ~my wretc1~ed
existence."
As a fierce pang of jealousy shot through the heart
Do Mere, he arose to his feet, and said, in the moat
intense state of excitement,

"It is ever the same therne-Delamere! Delamere!
And, with a sneer and an oath, "It is clear no one else
has a place in your heart but this murdered lover."
"Will you~ do what I ask?" said Elise, her features
pale and rigid with an unrevealed resolve.
"Never !~ by heaven!" he cried, and strode the floor
like a madman, muttering fierce and foul imprecations.
"You will not?" said Elise.
Never ! "
"Then hear me, Alfr6de de Vere: my blood shall be
required at your h~nds. You defy me? Then the result
be on your soul."l And, with the forced caimPess of a
mighty will, she gathered up the heavy folds of her vel-
vet dress, drew more tightly around her the lace scarf,
and walked from the room with the proud step of an
empress.
lIe was left alone-alone with his evil deeds; but they
were company enough for him at that moment.
ChAPTER XLIII.
REMORSE.
FEW days after this interview, the city papers
were teeming with accounts of a thrilling inci-
dent. From one of them the following is ex-
tracted:
"In the 'Tombs,' the cell of the pP~o~ier Alphonse

I)elainere-D'Estaing w~.s the scene of a revolting tragedy
last night, which resulted in the instant death of Elise
Duponte by suicide.
"Overcome with remorse at the part she had taken in~.
the capture and persecution of the prisoner, and urged
on l)y the death of Gustave and Marie Delamere, she.
went to offer the prisoner his liberty. This he indig4
neatly refused at her hands, and upbraided her in the
bitterest terms xvith the death of those two whom he
declared she had murdered. She cried for mercy, and,
casting herself at his feet, implored him, with tears in
her eyes, to fly, and rescue her soul from the guilt of his
blood. As if her touch had been infectious, he cast her
contemptuously from him, telling her he would prefer
ten thousand deaths, to life given by such blood-stained
hands. Again she pleaded, and again and again ;bnthe
persistently cried, 'Never!' While she continued ear~
nestly to implore him to escape.
"At length, finding all remonstrance vain, she drew
forth a Spanish stiletto which was concealed in her belt~,
and, by a well-directed blow, sent its point into her heart.
With a groan, and a piteous look from her startled eyes,
she fell upon the floor of the cell, crying, 'Farewell!
farewell!'
"D'Lstaing flew to the door, and, beating furiously
upon it, cried, 'Murder! murder! murder !' Pull soon
the prison was aroused. A surgeon came, but he pxo.
flounced all life extinct; for the weapon had been sent
straight to the l)rineipal vital organ.
"The jailor and his assistants have all been arrested,
but there is a generally-expressed desire that the former
shall be released. his services have ever been faithfully

rendered; and besides, he exhibits the forged permit,
whiAi has so much the semblance of genuilene~s as tQ
deceive those best skilled in the detection of false chiro~
raphy, bearing this orcllkr:
"'Allow Sister Fid6le access to the cell of the prisoner
JYEstaiug.'
"The fearful g~ncde of this misguided woman should
be a warning to all those who prefer the gilded paths of
vice to the unvarnished walks of virtue. For, sooner or
later, though the time be delayed until the honest death-
hour, remorse will overtake them, and crush them with
the weight of its bitter accusations. The public heart
goes forth in deepest sympathy for this wretched, and, it
may be added, irresponsible woman; for, born beneath
the sickly' glare of midnight carousals, reared in their
demoralizing atmosphere, she was very early trained by
both mother and father to the career of guilt in which
she was such a brilliant and successful leader. If the
daughter's soul wa~ so lashed into self -avenging fury,
what torture must they suffer, who in the sight of Jleaven
are responsible for the manner in which the child was
reared. Vengeance unto them, while all must, or should,
pray for pardon and peace to the ashes of Elise Du.
poute."'
The paper dropped from Maud's hands, With strained
and flashing eyes she had commenced, and, dissolved in
tears, she had finished the touching story.
In this a new dilemma was presented her. The jaiior,
her only friend, under arrest, what could she do?
- Thought was agonizing. Wonder ceased to be wonder,
and took the form of speculation. Should she ever sets

D'Estaing again? and, if so, how and when? She. felt
in her feebleness, like a prisoner bird fretting against the
bai's of its cage.
Throwing on ~her hat, she walked rapidly in the diree
tion of the "Tombs," to find her worst fears confirmed..
J)onblc guards, composed of strange, ro~igh men, were on
duty. The bolted and barred iron grates looked more
massive and formidable than ever. Then came another
miserable reflection. her money was well-nigh exhaust-
ed; and as she almost ran along the crowded streets, men
turned to look after her. She was filled with despair,
and maddened even to the desire to follow to the grave
~Elise Dupoute.
"But am I ready to die?" was her mental exclama-
lion. "Ready? Ah, no!" She laughed the laugh of
a maniac behind her thick veil. "Ready?* No, no; not
until he is safe; and then-----"
And what then?
She sped along, down this street and that, around cor~
ner after corner, to return again and again to the prison-
gates, muttering incoherently, "Not until he is safe; alid
then---"
And what then? Poor Thud! thou hast sown the
wind; it is meet thou shouidst reap the whirlwind.

CIIAPTER XLIV.
TOO LATE.
ilE jury had brought in a verdict of "guilty" ~
the sentence had been solemnly pronounced
amidst a death-like silence, and the prisoner had
been remanded to solitary confinement.
The guards had been doubled, and peremptory orders
given the jailor to admit no one, under penalty of removal
'and imprisonment. The interest which had been mam~
feasted for the unfortunate man ceased with his disappear-
ance from public, and in his solitary cdl he felt what it
was to be forsaken by friends and forgotten by the woi4d.
If this oblivion could have included every human being
whom he knew, it would have been welcomed gladly;
but when he thought of her who had abandoned every-
thing, even reputation and the salvation of her own soul
for him, ho became maddened, and life was torture.
Deprived of hmnan sympathy, and a stranger to the ~'~-
CiOUS pl'011115C5 contained in the holy Book, his conscience
racked. him with unceasing accusations, even as the vul-
ture l)Icyc(l I1l)Ofl the vitals of Prometheus± his waking
hours were written all over with Remorse, and his sleep
was harrowed with frightful visions of that final hour
which should expose him to mankind as an example of
ist ice and a warl1in~ to evil-doers.
But what an ignominious death! To be hung like a
cOlunlOU felon! his refinement of feeling recoiled from
such a death, and if it (x)uld be averted, it should be.
But how? It would have. been better t6 have shunned

the act which brought such ignominy as its reward, would
it not? But men do not think of the consequences, when
ruled by passion; and it was too late now to wish the
dCC(l undone.
Thus day after day of reproaches and heart-burnings
passed away, and brought him nearer Eternity; but the
hereafter gave him little concern, for his thoughts were
equally divided between Maud, and how he could escape
the awful death to which he had been sentenced. Prison~
bolts and bars have never yet been able to crush a kindly
feeling in the human heart, and oftentimes the custodians
of unfortunate men have been induced to do them a
secret service. Could he hope for such a thing?
But what had become of Maud? Perhaps she\v~s ill
-dying; and as D'Estaing recalled her pale and haggard
face, he groaned in spirit, as memory forced upon him
the painful recollection of the blight that fell upon all
who came within his fated circle. Poor, erring woman!
she was dying, but she gave it little thought, what though
her strength was failing rapidly, and her life-blood was
ebbing sadly.
how the time came and went, she never knew, for the
days were sunless, the nights were starless, and no spark
of hope irradiated the gloom in whii~h she was enveloped
like a funeral pall.
Most of her time was spent in gazing at the prison-
w~dls, which loomed up dismally before her like some
terrible storm-cloud, which bears destruction and d&amp;atE to
those who come within its ~blackened track. Once or
twice, when passing the prison, she had spoken to the
guard, but, without i~eplying, they had only stared at her
~nd turned away. Then, walking on, she would soon be

R05

lost in the crowds which are always surging upon th~
streets of the metropolis, until failing stre'igth would
warn her to retrace her weary footsteps. When within
h~r room, she would throw herself upon a couch, but to
eat he the pillow afresh with scalding tears, or perhaps
watch from the window those cruel Walls which impris
oned her life.
Was there no regret for the past, no apprehension fom
the futtlre? No! Blinded and infatuated as this un-
'ha~ppy woman was by an aThabsorbing passion, the past
was forgotten and the future ignored.
To battle with the present, required not only the cour-
age of a hero, but the self~sacrificing spirit of a martyr;
and human nature was fast yielding beneath the daily
~h~cI~s whidi it received..
And such is Love! -
Or, at least, the ideal love, for which so many hearts
are ever. yearning, and which they vainly believe will
brin~'them happiness. But is not the - evidence here to
the contrary? For wherever love is found, which is nei-
ther controlled by reason nor guided by religion, it will
have misery fonts companion.
Thus a month-a wlmol~ month-dragged 'its weary
length aIon~, and it was now but' the day preceding the
execution. To say that Mand was distract,~ would fail to
convey the slightest conception of the agony which was
killing her. She scarcely tasted food; sleep was almost
unknown to her; and having grown thinner and pak~m'
- day by day, it was difficult to believe that the spectre of
*    the present was the beautiful woman of a year ago.
But "some gnef~ gnaw deep; some woes are hard tc
I  K          ~- k~'~

bear;" and upon heart and face of Maiid were dr~wu
deep lines, which Time could never obliterate.
On this last clay before that horrible sentence should be
put into execution,' she thought, if she could only gain
access 011CC more to his cell, that she would' yield to h~i~
oft-repeated request, and fly with him-no matter where~
no matter what the consequences, so she could but save
him a felon's death.
Wliile she was indulging these gloomy reflections,
within the ~prison-walls certain officials were busily en~-
gaged in the -final preparations for the execution, which
was to take place at sunrise. The gallows-that grim
destroyer of human life-threw its dismal shm~dow over
the unhappy inmates of that home of misfortune; and
even the officers trod softly, and whispered, as though
they then stood in the presence of thp dead. The pris4
oner was a gentleman, and by his courteous manner had
awakened a* sympathy in the hearts of his rough keepers
which they rarely felt for any one. But sympathy~buld
not stay the law in -its course, nor defraud justice of its'
xrictim; so the preparations went sadly on to their com~
pletion.
Justice! Who talks of justice '~
An earthly judge and tribunal! It is ever thus with
the works of man, as compared with, the acts of Christ.
One scourgeth, the other consoleth; man seeks revenge,
but "Jesijs is the Lamb of God, without wrath or judg-.
mnents;" and Heaven grart that mercy, and not justice,
may be administered in the final day!
D'Estaing had waited and watched and hoped, until

And still she came not, although each moment s~p~
rated them further and further, and brought the hour of
execution nearer.
it was 110W but twenty-four hours, and, as all hopes of
ever seeing the loved again fled from his breast, he wrote
her a hurried note, then swallowed a white powder, and,
throwing himself upon his cot, whispered,
"Farewell, Maud, forever!"
Why such haste? Will they never meet again? Ii
seems impossible; but who can tell?
With a resignation which only contemplated the cessa-
tion of the ills of this life, D'Estaing looked calmly on
death, and sat, in the darkness of his cell, awaiting its.
stealthy approach.
The day crept by on leaden feet, and towards nightfall
Maud groped forth, and for the' last time approached the
gloomy walls of the home of misfortune.
Recognizing one of the old guard on duty, a low cry
broke from her lips, and, slipping a gold coin in his hand,
she inquired if the jailor was restored. Upon hearing
that he was, her heart beat high with hope, and she asked
the guard to let him know that she was there.
"I dare not even speak to him on~the subject," said the
guard, as he examined the bright coin he held by the gas-
light.
*     '~ here's more money for you; and it shall be trebled,'
if you will only take me to him," she pleaded.
"Impossible!" answered the man, while lie pocketed
the gold.
her heart sank at these words, and the tears stood in
her eyes, as one by one the hopes of a few minutes ago
vanished in the gloom which was settling over her hue.

TOO LATE.

The guard was walking his round again, as she stood
gazing at the entrance, and the next moment ~she was
hoping again, for her old friend, the jailor, stood within
the doorway. It was but the work of an instant, and she
was by his side. She seized hold of him, and, in attempt..
ing to get rid of her, a terrible scuffle ensued, which
resulted in landing them both within the hail. * It was a
matter of life and death with one, and of displacement
and imprisonment with the other. It was not' strano'e
b
that the first should win, for anxiety and love gave super-
human strength to Maud's delicate limbs, and she cluiig
to him with a tenacity which all his force could not extri-
cate.
"Let me see you but a moment," she pleaded.
"Impossible! Let me go, or I ~vihl call a guard, and
have you put out!"
"Let inc see you alone, just one minute, and then yon
may send me away, if you will," still pleaded the kneel-
ing woman, as the tears poured down her cheeks.
It was dark as midnight in the corridor, and it was for~
tunate for both Maud and the sailor that it was, and that
there was no one near to hear or see them.
The heart of the r5ugh man was touched at last, and,
after bolting and barring the door, he turned in the direc-
tion of his ofdce, and said,
"Come on!" muttering to himself as lie went, " The
first mnam~i followed a ~voman to his ruin, and I bet the last
man will be doinr the same thing." But gold was tempt~
ing, and he was fast getting into a melting' mood Both
0
having entered his office, he closed and locked the door,
and said, rather savagely,
"What do you want with me I"

I must see the prisoner."
"Impossible!" he said, stamping his foot impatiently
on the floor. "I came too near getting a halter around
my iieck for letting that last woman in there, and I'll
never try it again, so help me -.
"But this is different," pleaded Maud. ." I'll make no
noise, and no one will ever know that I have been here."
"There's no use talking; so you might just as well go."
"But think-it is the last night. It is only a few hours
until -" But the words died upon her lips, and a
fresh burst of tears expressed what she could not utter.
K "~ can't help it! And let me tell you, thai all the
gol4 in the world could never tempt me to disobey orders
again; so you might just as well go at once."
- With a woman's quick perception, Maud knew that the
time was too precious to be given up to weeping; so,
forcing back her tears, she said:
"To a man of your kind heart this must be a horrible
life you lead."
"It is! it is!" he said; a moment after adding, with
much feeling, "and God knows, if I could, I would leave
it this night, and forever."
"Nothin~ easier," said Maud, with a well-assumed air
o:f indifference, that was more persuasive than words.
"hi God's name, tell me how!" claimedd the man, in
a toue of interest and excitement.
"Sit down, and I will tell you;" and, leaning across
die table, she watched his face closely, as she said: "Sup-
pose you had five thousand dollars; what would you do
with it?
\Vith sparkling eyes, lie said:

your gold, and to the. same end that; I endure this devil's.

"Let me but see the prisoner, and yoa shall have twico

"You jest! "~ he exclaimed, arising from his seat.
"As there is a God in heaven, I am in earnest."
"But what shQuld I do with it? I should be taken up
and ~
"Not so. Take the order which I will give you.
Escape to-night. Get the money, and leave for parts
unknown."
"But what will become of you?"
"Never mind me. But tell me, quick, if you will do
i~ ?
"So help me God, I will !"
"Thank Heaven!" burst from Maud's lips, as she
bowed her head in gratitude upon the table. A minute
afterwards, she said, "Give me pen, ink, and paper, and
while I write the order, dismiss the guard, and by the
time you return I will be ready."
handing her the desired writing materials, he shook
his head, and, as he left the room, muttered significantly,
"A Ii, woman! woman! woman! woman!"
During his short absence Maud wrote th~ following
note
"Il\Iu. BROUGUTON:

"P. S.-l{ate Byrd can identify the handwriting.
'KM. II"
With much difficulty the guard was at length disposed
of, aLld after what seemed aii age to Maud, the jailor
returned.
Giving him the letter, she said,
"hi the city of Savannah, Georgia, you will find Mr.
Broughton, the gentleman to whom this note is addressed.
Make all haste to arrive there; and, having secured the
money, make all possible speed to quit the country. My
best wishes, and the blessing of God, go with you."
lie bowed, and took the letter in silence.
"But one more question: If the prisoner will accept
his release to.-night, can you, will you, let us escape with
you?"
"I can, and will!" lie promptly answered.
"But come-Act 'us be quick, for I fear I am already
8llspected by two of the guards."
They were now groping, through the long, dark corri~
dors, and as' they reached the door the jailor said:'
"As soon as the guards are changed at midnight, I will
come for you."
Another moment, and she was inside the cell; but the
deep silence, the stifled air, and the midnight darkness,
filled her soul with such gloomy forebodings, that she
could not move.
As soon 'as her eyes became accustomed to the dark-
~ she discovered the~ loved one lying upon his couch,
and, by his heavy breathing, fancied he must be asleep.
Advancing hastily, she knelt by his side, and whispered,
"Alphonse!" But no ~response or recognition c~mQ.

shaking him, she called again, "Alphonse!" But he
answered not. Then raising his head, whilst the most
terrible a pierced her heart, she wailed forth pite~
ously, "Alphonse I what is the matter? Awaken.--it is
Maud who calls you!"
Rubbing his eyes and opening them for an instant, he
murmured, drowsily, as he turned upon his pillow,
"iMlaud.!
"Alphonse, awaken! I have come to fly with you-~--
to take you from this prison-cell, to life and love!"
Arousing himself once more, he murmured, brokenly,
"Too late! I'm-dying!"
"My God! Alphonse, what is the matter? Why do
you talk so?" And she bathed his face with hot, ecald~
ing tears.
Bitt no word escaped his lips, for the poison which he
had been taking at intervals during the day was doing its
work well, and his life was ebbing . rapidly. Suddenly
the truth flashed upon her, and she fell prostrate and
fainting upon the floor.
What a scene !~-one dying, the other unconseioiis.
And this was 'the end of a love which they fancied w~w
happiness! Was ever happiness so crowned with thorns?
Were ever hearts so crucified? Guilt demands beavy
sacrifices as its reward, and, like "knre," will, soon or
late, be "its own aveno'er"
Determined not 4to die the ignominious d~th to which
he had been sentence~, D'Estaing had enlisted the kindly~
services of one of the guard, and the man had furnished

fatal poison.
Thus, with his soul fi~ll of guilt, had. he thrust himself
uncalled into the presence of his Maker; and God grant
he may not have committed the unpardonable sin!
The swoon Maud had fallen into did not last long; but
when consciousness returned, she was but the victim of
fresh lamentations . And as ~he sat there in. the dark,
with the loved one dying, she prayed most fervently that
she too might die there by his side. Poor, deluded
woman! She thought not ~f the eternity-of the end-
less~~ges of suffering to which she longed to go. No; it
was on.
with ly an ove~whelining desire to be rid of the present,
all its misei~y and unhappy memories, flier flrst
impulse had been to call, the, guard and send for a sur~
geon. But then ~ha thought, "No;* it is better so, for he
will escape the. horrid execution at snn~ise," Thus,, with
one hand pressed upon his heart and th~ other upon his
temple, she kept her lonely vigil as his life ebbed slowly
away. IIer tears ceased to flow, for the fountain. was
exhausted, and only groans escaped her lips, while the
old pain was piercing her heart like a dagger. her life
was going too, but it was so slowly, so~ wearily I It was
like the victims of old~ when, beino' bound to the rack,

not of those she had deserted, or of that Hereaftei' to
which she was swiftly going; for the past was forgotten;
and the future was a black darkness into which she could
not, dared not, penetrate.
As she sat there stroking the temples of the dying prism
oner, she was suddenly startled by the opening of the
door; an~ as the clock then. told twelve, the jailor stood
by her side. lie said, in a half-frightened whisper,
"Everything is ready; let's be gone."
"But I cannot got" said IMlaud. "112)o not wait for me,
but go at once."
"What! will he not accept his release?"
"ile is already released!" And as the wozds left her
lips, her head sank upon the breast of the dying man.
"Already released! What do ~CLU mean?" exclaimed,
the jailer, in surprise.
Just then the, heart ceased it~ irregular beats, and she
said,
"Put your hand upon his heart, and feel if it throbs."
Doing as he was bidden, without feeling any responsive
throb, he said,
"My God! have you killed him?"
"lleaven.s! no. I found him in this dying condition
when. I came, and suppose he must have taken. some kind
of poison; and here will I remain until they bear him to

"Oh, no! do not talk so,'but fly! Go-leave me! I

"But I will not go, and leave you here to suffer, while
lain enjoying your gold."
"That does not matter."
"But you must go with me. Come,~ now; time is fly-
ing, and we may be discovered." And, taking hold of
her, he would have forced her from the cell; but she
pleaded so for "just one more minute!" Then throwing
herself madly across his bosom, she, kissed him a thou.
sand farewells, while her burning tears bathed his face,
and her heart bled drops of blood. It was an eternal
farewell' and God in heaven alone knows to what dark
despairing d~ths the human heart can descend without
bi~6~kiii~7 What a relief it would have been to have
dropped dead at his side! But the curse of suffering is,
that the victim must live; and she lived to endure the
torture of the damned. She took his hands in hers, and
clutched in one was a piece of crumpled paper, which
she seized and slipped in her pocket, thinking it might
give her sorn~ clue to his death. Then, kissing him one
long, last, eternal farewell, she fell fainting in the sailor's
arms, and he bore her from the cell forever. Descending.
the steps, he soon gained a subterranean passage, through
which he ~ with his broken-hearted burden; and,
rough man that lie was, he felt glad to ,have her uncon-
scious, for he knew thatit was at least momentary relief.
Soot ,tl~e~j~ad gained the street; and as lie stopped
~:and ~ ced the fragile woman whom he held upon some
steps, the night air revived her, and she opened her eyes
to realize fully the eterrnd gloom' in which she was en-

shrouded. The jailor walked impatiently back and forth,
and Iiually ventured to say,
"It will never do for us to be seen together."
"True," answered Maud; then, tottering forward, she
extended her hand, and said,
"Good-by! May God bless you!"
"But whero are you going?" asked this rough man,
anxiously.
"Never mind me, but look to your own safety."
And as they pressed each other's hands in silence, the
tears stood in their eyes, and the jailor felt an uncomfort-
able twinge about his heart that was new to him. A
moment afterwards, they were lost to view in the dark~.
ness, as each one went their appointed way..
The cold, pale starlight looked down upon iNland as she
wended her weary footsteps to a building which was no
stranger to her, and by the pale morning light she was
discovered in a prostrate and insensible condition upon
the steps of the Convent of St. Madeleine.

that "in the midst of life" they are "in death." Let
them think of it, and make their peace with God before
it is too late.
The constant strain of the last few months upon a con-
stitution naturally delicate had culminated in inflamma-
tion of the l)rain, and for three weeks Maud hovered
between life and death, with her feet even over the
shadowy border of the latter. The delicate weight,
which preponderated first on one side and then on the
other, at length fell into the scale of life, and she awoke
from the long sleep of delirium to find all her hair gone,
and her hands so wasted as-to be almost transparent.
She was alone, and, on looking a round, instantly recog..
~2 nized the little chamber which once before had afforded
her shelter. Then, without an effort or desire to recall
them, every incident of that last horrible night rushed
over her recollection, and, groaning, she covered her face
with her hands in a vain attempt to shut out the feai'~
fully-remembered picture.
Whether it had been one short hour before, or weeks,
or months, she could not determine; for to those who,
grope in unknown realms, Time is measureless, and
months and years but as days.
Lying there so still and cold, and passionless and tear~
less, those beautiful words of "Lucile" came into her
mind, and she whispered to herself:
"I            within   t~ieI of life;

of the rack and the wheel; she had mouriied in sack

Life, with its joys~, its pleasures, its allurements, was
over for her now, and weariness and resignation had
taken the place of action and striving. Peeling that the
end was i~ot far remote, she waited with patience.

/ Vi ~' lfhe door was opened softly, and a gentle creature, who
had nursed her most tenderly, glided to the bedside.; and
as Maid raised her eyes in consciousness to hers for the
first time, she smiled, and a gratified expression shone in
them.
"You are much better?" she said.
"Yes, I suppose so-thank you," was the feeble reply~
as ~he reached forth her small, thin hand, and grasped
that of h~r nurse.
"I am very glad; and, with care, you will Soon be
well."
"I shall never again be well, Sister Agnes," she said,
sadly. "'Who can minister to a mind diseased,' or
'pltidc frbtn the memory a rooted sorrow?' No, no;

"There is One above, who is able to cure all pains, all

forgiveness through the Atonement, and He will not cast
you off."
"Show me the way, Sister Agnes. Lead my guilty
footsteps into the right path; and if I find the true God
at last, I shall not have lived in vain."
"Put your trust in Him, and He will bring all good
things to pass. Pray, through faith and in faith; for it
is by the prayer of &amp;faith that the ear of God can be
reached and His favor secured."
And as that humble disciple of the Most High knelt
by The sick woman's bedside, they both prayed earnestly
that the one aching, blighted heart might rest at last
from its reckless waywardness, within the fold of the
Eternal. Their intercessions must have found an audb
~nce in God; for, in that brief space of time, a peace
which lie alone could have given descended upon Maud's
heart, and the storm, that had so long raged in her young
breast, was lulled into sweet calm.
When Sister Agnes arose from her knees, Maud said,
"Stoop' down! Bend lower! Let me kiss you, and
fold you to my heart. I know God, the God who has
spoken peace 'to my soul, will bless and magnify your
holy ministrations."
"God grant His peace, and give you His mercy and
everlasting rest." And, bending over, Sister Agnes,
ch~sped 'the emaciated form of Maud in her arms, while
soft, refreshingg tears stole down the cheeks of both.
Some little time passed in this clinging, tearful, affec~
tio~iate embrace, and, again asking God's blessing upon the
sufferer, the Sister disengaged her arms, and turned to go~
* "Would it trouble you very much to send a dispatch
for me?" said Maud.

"No trouble at all, child ;-and here I have pencil and
paper." And, by Maud's dictation, she wrote:

street. Bring Harry with you. It is my dying
request."
"What signature?" said Sister Agnes, looking up.
"None is needed. She will know from whom it comes.
Address, 'Care of Mr. W. L. Broughton, Savannah,
Georgia'; and please send without delay."
"Yes, I will. And. now, if you will drink some of~
this port~wine, [think you will be able tQ g~t some
refreshing sleep. By the, by, here are your port&amp;.mou.~
naie, and a letter which I took from your pocket;" and,
handing them to her, she quietly left the 'room.
'Tearing open the note, INland read, with straining eyos~
the last words penned by the man she had so long~ so
madly, so sacrificially loved. She fell back upon her
pillow, and folding both hands over her almost ~ti1ed
heart, the film of death came over her eyes, and blessed
insensibility came to relieve her of her more than death~
agony.
Enough! There is grief too sacred for disclosure~;
and, drawing over this little. alt~,r-chamber the veil' of
priv*~cy, the poor bruised reed is left alone with heart and
God.

CIIAPTER XLVI.
JOI~GIVEN.
0 describe all that Kate suffered on account of
her absent friend, would be beyond the power of
the pen. The telegram brought forth a ferveilt
"Thank God ~" A letter from Sister Agnes, which fob
lowed the telegram, confirmed her belief in the purity of
Maud's life and conduct ~ and the sudden and unexpect-
ed appearance of Ooionel Iiartridge startled her into
silence. Tired of roaming, heart-sick and weary, he had
yielded to an impulse which induced him to return to hi~
abandoned home.
The meeting between 1~Iate and himself was a sad ot~e.
Kate was tearful; he was silent; while beth WerO bowed
beneath a weight of agony which ~was more than oppres-
sive. Without a word of explanation or apology, she
placed the dispatch and the letter of ~ister~ Agnes in his
hand; and when he had read them, ho looked up with
tu~nttered meaning in his eyes, and simply said,
"1 will go with you."
Tier preparations for the journey were soon completed,
and that afternoon they sailed f~r ~ew York.
.     .~           .
Between waking and sleeping, and the sad pleasure of
seeing Kate once more, the following week flitted by, and
was soon numbered with the past. One bright morning
towards its end, Thud awoke from a refreshing slumber
and a strangely soothing dream, to find Kate, the object
of her dreams, standing over her. A low scream of

delight burst frofi~ her lip~, ~id in the next in~ta~t they
were locked in each other's arms, while a torrent of kisses
rained on her lips, brow, and cheeks.
"is it you-~-yoit, dear Kate?" she asked, as if rallied
doubtilig the evidence of her senses.
"Yes-yes, it is, my darling 1" and tears of joy stood
in her eyes.
Kat&amp;s brow grew clouded and sorrowful at the pale
face and weary look of her unfortunate friend, and she
said,
"Why, Maud, did you not let me know where you
were, and that you were ill?"
Looking up at Kate, she shook her head, and said,
"Not one word in reference to th~ past. I canii~t
bear it."
Kate bowed her head in assent, tears filling her tender
eyes and flooding her ~heek~, as she contemplated the
wreck of the young life before her.
A Wistful look came over Maud's countenance, aiid she
said, timidly,.
"have you any tidings of Co1on~l llartridge, Kate?"
Despite her surpriser Kate's face brightened, and sh~
said,
"Why?"
"Because, dear, I mii~t s~o him. My days are nurn~
bored. I am dying;* and I cannot die in peace until I
have asked hi~ forgiveness."
"Do not talk ~f dying!" said Kate, sadly, as she bait
over and kis~d her hollow, emaciated cheeks, but at~the
same tiui~ i~ealh4ng that what she said wa~ fatally true.
"Excuse me a xn~ment?" said she, hastily leaving the
room.


~24                 FORG!VF 7~
Very soon the door was opened, and Colonel llartridge
entered.
With a shriek, Maud sprang to the floor, her guilty
conscience conjuring up some apparition which had
intruded only to mock her. But as he raised her up,
and laid her gently on the bed, the truth flashed upon
her, an~1, drawing back, each regarded the other for a
moment silently. Then taking D'Estaing's note from
under her pillow, she handed it to him, and, with a trem-.
bling voice, said,
"Read that, and say whether you can for a dying
woman?"
Opening it his eyes detected the well-knowit 1iarid~
writing of his friend, and a film came over his sight, as
he read:
"I have waited, and had hoped to see you once more,
Maud; but we shall never* meet again. I am dying.
The death-sealing drug has been kindly furnished me by
one of the guard, too merciful to witness my death on
the ignominious gallows-tree. Morphine is sure, while it
robs dissolution of iiiany of its p~ngs. I am thankful
for it. We are none of us very brave, I take it, in this
hour. But enough! I only write to urge you to return
to your noble husband. Tell him all, and ask his mercy
-his forgiveness. Tell him, from me, a dying man, that
you are worthy of his love. Your conduct is above all
reproach. Tell him, that you oiily came to offer me xny
liberty, and nothing more. If he would not believe an
assertion you might make upon your own responsibility,
he cannot doubt the word of the dying, for the dying are
seldom guilty of falsehood or trifling. The day is grow.'

ing ~1ark around~ me; the light is fading; the shadows
thicken! My pulse is growing weaker! I am not
afraid there is light at the other end of the valley.
God bless you, my poor Maud! Farewell, forever!
"D'ESTAING."
Ilaxring finished reading the note, Colonel Hartridge
looked at Maud thoughtfully.
"My wife, you have suffered; and in the more than
mortal anguish of this suffering have expiated all offencos
ao'ainst your husband. Therefore he forgives you, and,
if he knows his own soul, as freely as he hopes to be for-
given of God for the sins of the flesh."
his language was measured. His words were well and
carefully weighed-as well and as carefully weighed as
any on record in a Court of Assizes. lIe stood at some
distance from her, and his manner was as cold and as
undemonstrative as ever. It is true, there '~as then cause
for his coldness and haughtiness; but there had not been
in the olden thnes, in the early days of their wedded life,
when her heart hungered and thirsted for sympathy and
tenderness, and when, 'perhaps, these-the love a woman's
heart demands, the delicate attentions so flattering to her
nature-might have averted the dreadful consequences
which sowed their pillows with thorns, and wrecked the
lives of both.
"I do not deserve this," she said, meekly; "but I felt
-I felt---that I could not die in peace until I had craved
your pardon for my many offences."
" But why talk of dying?" said he, seating himself
beside her bed aAd clasping one of her thin white hands

in one of his with ~me *armth of mariner. "We will
cure you in a little time when we get yon home."
"home!" she echoed, sadly, as she opened her dreamy
eyes, and stared at him with a look of surprise. "home,
did yon say?"
"Yes; I said, when we get you home, we will soon
have yon in good health again."
"I have no home!" she answered, with a long sigh.
"You have the same home, ~faud, as that to which you
were borne as a bride; the same hearts to welcome you;
the same e~y~s to watch over you; the same personal com~
forts at command"
lie drew nearer, his spirit feeling the mighty lack of
her lifetime, and, taking her in his~ arms, ymrmured
words of si~ch tenderness, such sympathy, ~ueh contrition,
as had never before shaped themselves to his lips; and
again and again he kissed her cold, pale brow;. and a
single bnrnii~ tear fell upon her cheek, telling in unuP
tered eloquence of the smothered heat that dwelt in hi~
heart-of his burning, consuming love for her.
At first she trembled and wasfrightened at this demon.
station of emotion; and then she felt the softening,
melth~g influence of his 'warn~, holy passion, upon. her
chilled and frozen heart and she wept. The fountain
that she fancied locked forever beneath coldness and
neglect, burst forth, and the waters were sweet and heal.
ing.
Jn( the midst of this blissful experience, however,
Remorse raised its st6ny visage~ Withdrawing his arms
fro~n their clasp upon her form, she looked ~up at him,
~t~d then1 ~ting dowi~ her eyes, she said,
"I have foffeited all claim to your home, your love.

your hearP-Ao all the friends and all the friendships
which would welcome me back to my bridabhome."
"Will you not let me decide that?" he said.
"Pardon me, my husband," she said. "I can never
eon~ent to outrage your liable golierosity. I can nevei
return!"
"But indeed you can!" cried Kate, coming in at that
momCnt, gnd hearing hei~ last remark.
"Yes, indeed you can!" eeh9ed U~rry Fielder, who,
to Mand's surprise, ~entered the room with Kate, and,
coming forward, pressed both of her hands in his, and
kissed them, with sparkling tears in his honest eyes. "I
have not the slightest idea what it is, but, you know, I am
always ready to endorse all that Kate says."
At a glance Maud saw the happy state of affairs that
existed between those two, and with a glad sniiie gave
them so to understand.
The friends around her noted the smile; but it was
soon drowned in a sigh.
"Let me die here!"
"No!" en~iphatically said Colonel llartridge.
"No! no!" eri~d Kate.
"'No! no! no!" cried harry Fielder.
She placed h~r hand iii that of her husband.
"I will go with you."
"It is well!" said Colonel llartridge, with deep meau~.

her days, be they Lew or many, within those cloistered
walls, and from those godly women learn to forget the
vanities of the outer world, and to do good for the siim
pie love she 'bore to the Author of all good.
But it was not to be so. The same evening, as the
gray shades of night drove from nature the purple
shadows of twilight, and the stars peeped forth, they saw
them all homeward-bound, and Maud not unwillingly.
CHAPTER XLVII.
~HOME AGAIN ~
"'Mid all these, how small one grief-.
One wrecked heart whose hopes are o'er!~,
LL life is a tragedy," says Carlyle; and as the
curtain was so soon to fall upon "one wrecked
heart whdse hopes were o'er," there remaii~s
little else to be told. She was at "home again," but
home to her no more; and strive as she did against
she felt like an intruder within those walls. There ~he
was, in. the same room to which she was brought as a
bride, and wl4ieii life was spread out before her in an end-
less panorama of beauty and sunlight. Looking from a
bow~window into which her lounge had ~been rolled, she
gazed upon the Pulaski monument, and her eyes then
wandered on into the lovely park beyond, where innocent
children, beautiful women, and stately men strolled leis.

"hOME A4MIN?"               329*
urely. The merry laughter of the little ~es fell like
music upon her weary 'heart, and the men and women all
looked so happy. But were they happy? Was there no
skeleton in their hearts?
"Into each life some rain must fall;
Some days must be dark and dreary."
But she hoped they were h~ppy, even if the shadows.
were growing longer and deep er across her own pathway.
It was not quite three years ago, and, yet it seemed like
ages, sand the beautiful dreams of ,her bridal days van~
ished out of sight, down the dreary vista of storms that
had raged around her bark.
Growing weary of gazing upon scenes which only
recalled painful memories, she drew the curtains, and,
turning over, closed her eyes.
It was not to sleep, though; and, laying there, she
thought,
"Well, let it be. It is all over now, and can't be
helped. Regrets are unavailing, and repinings are sinful.
And perhaps, after all, nothing but the chastening rod
under which I haye writhed would have ever brought me
to the feet of Jesus. here, with a resignation which is
only surpassed by my faith, do I kifeel, and pray that I
may find, a home beyond the skies, eternal in the heav-
ens.,,
Growing weaker day by day, she knew full well that
the end was near. Colonel Ilartridge and Kate, and Dr.
Dnpr6e, all endeavored to cheer her with the prospect of
being well again; but she and her "tired heart" felt that
their weary pilgrimage was near its close. Fer the sake
of those dear ones who watched h~r so tenderly, she
