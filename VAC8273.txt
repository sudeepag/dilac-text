PRE FACE.
Some writer~ has said that the preface is the best part
of a book. Now I should dislike very much to think that
it formed the best part of this volume that I have given
to the public with so many misgivings. My excuses in
writing this little story are simiple- these: To while away
the lonely wintry hours in the mountain, and to entertain
in a measure the fireside group. I had no idea at the time
it would go to the press, but at the urgent request of a
friend' was prevailed upon to send it, and found to my
*sa isfactiou. that it was kindly received.
If liy readers will find any pleasure in its perusal, I
sli all be much pleased, and will be amply rewarded for the
labor it cost mec.

Y namc is Jo/in, and a very romantic name it
is, and the most romantic old fellow in the
world I               it

called Iiomlkd
handsome, attractive, captivating, comely,
endearing, graceful, char       mao'nificent John
and ungraceful John. Now this is right hard to
bear, don't you think? Who is it that does not love
to be praised and admired? and who is it that likes
to be called repulsive and ugly? In all this wide
world I do not think there is One; and everyone
becomes indignant tWit is so called, whether they

so, since a pair of dimpled arms entwined themselves
'lovingly around my Old neck, not many days ag
giving mc a great hug, and (he owner saying: "I love
the name of John; it is so easy to call, and all dear
old people ought to be called John, too." Now don't
come to the hasty conclusion, my friends, that these
little arms belong to me. Oh ! no such thing; but
you shall hear all about them as~J go along and telL
the old man's story."
I must go back far into the past, over many, many
eventful years, with their black, lowering clouds and
heavy storms that bowed the great oak and crushed the
slender lily. It is sad to think over events which were
fraught with sorrow, but the little Fairy, who sai(l she
loved even my name, and who lino'ers round the "old
man," ministering to him, smoothing his hoary locks
and kissing his wrinkled forehead, requests it, an(l I
am a doat~ng old man enough to sit down and spend a
couple of hours every day for my little darling's enter~
tainment. First, then, in commencing, I must, in jus-
ti6c to myselg, tell you who I am, what I am and where
I came from.
II was born in merry, old England, in a pretty white
cottage situate&amp; in a very verdant, fertile valley, not
many miles from the celebrated Thames. lit was there
that I saw the first peep of daylight, uttered the first
sound that escaped from my lips, took my first steps, got
the first thu~p on my big head, learned to hum that
very charming old English nursery song, "Pollie, put
the kettle on, and thcn in the little green yard, span-
gled with its buttercups and daisies (as I last remember

tie daughters, to ~vhom h~ devoted his life. In course
of time the little girls, as all little girls do, gre~v up to
be young ladies and got married. The eldest, Mary,
married a United States Navy Captain~ and ~vent to
the great Republic to live; here I drop all further
mention of' this aunt of mine, as I heard very little of
her after my mother's death, but think she (lied shoi~t1v
after her arrival in America. My mother was some
ycar~' younger than her sister, was very lovely, quite an
heiress and well connected. My father was the son of
an I~nglish barrister, Mr. James Meredith. He was
an unusually fine-looking young man, as the portrait
which hangs not far from here has told me, very lre~
possessing in appearance (which legacy he forgot to
bequeath to his pooP son), and an oratorical genius; at
an early age he was admitted to the bar and was corn~
pletely lionized. Country cousins s~varmed aroun(t
him a~ bees around the sWeetest flower. Sisters were
completely lost in admiration at this model of a young
man, with his many graces and winning address. How
it was that II was so ugly goodness only knows, when
bc Lii my mother and father were so peerless, except as
grammarians explain it, on the principle that "two neg-'.
at~ves arc equivalent to an a rrnative;" but I am eom~
forced by the old adage, "Pretty is as pretty does."
My father was a poor young man up to the time be
married my mother ; so in marrying her, lie won both
a fortune and a beauty. The meeting took place ~
follows:
it was oh a lovely May evening in I 7-~-, ~vhen the

in order, the best rooms in the hotel were l)repared and
made cQlnfc)rtable for the reception of' the distinguished
guests who had made such an impression on the eoin~
inunitv.
Well, landlord," said the new arrival ,as he found

host, after paying the necessary attention to his young
traveling companion, "you seem to be right quiet here
in tour little town ; not much, I suppose, to break the
monotony?'
"Well, nq;' answered the landlord, taking his pipe.
from his mouth and blowing a gi~eat puff of smoke
upwards; "there is not a great deal, to. be sure; but
now and then there is a little excitement, and to-night,
I believe, there is to be a slight variation."
"In what way?" asked the guest; "an opera Con
pmy, or anything of that kind?" thinking at the time
of th'e Young lady.

" Ah ! I should like very much to hear him, and

"it can't be J)OSsd)le," sai(I the facetious landlord,
"that the young lady is the daughter of so young a

such a hung."
"Ohm, yes !" ~said the guest, with a pleased smile,
thinking the host very agreeable; "oh, yes! she is my
own daughter, and has a sister some years older ~than
herself'."
"Well, well," said the landlord, "I should never
helievc it if I had not heard it from your own lips."
The gentleman bowed, in acknowledgement to the
compliment, and withdrew to his daughter's room.
"You may come in," said a soft voice, in answer to
his knock; "I am n6t asleep."

as anybody."
"Oh! yes, Ettic fiaÂ±tcrcr; that sounds mighty sweet
from your pretty lips, but the old glass, there, is not
such a story~teilcr. I have come to take you to the
hall, where there i3 to be a fine speech delivered by a

rsin~' star '~ ~             .,   to be given, I
believe, for some charitable purpose. Are you willing
to go? Would you like it? We shall be here for
several days, so you shall know this famous orator and
coquct with him as much as you please, so that you
won't be lonesome while my business detains me."
"For shame, papa! I would not coquet with an
body. You surely would not accusee me of' such a
thing! Why, what do you suppose I am made of:
"Why, what all other young ladies are made
pretty one. What else should you be made of?"
"You ar~ a naughty, teasing papa to say your daug 1i~
ter is a flirt. For shame ! Never mind; I will nQt
give you a chance to say such things of me macli
* I'm going to marry the first one that. will ask
me, even if it is this great orator, just to prove to you
that you are maligning your daughter in a most fearful
manner."
The father laughed, rand patting her on the head,
said, playfully: "Well, well, come on, now, and I
won't tease any more if you will only hurry and put
your bonnet, for it is nearly time."
"I'll be ready in a fe~ minutes. Just let me put
this flower ir~ my hair, for you know this' Demosthenes
must fall in love with me, and little flowers are great

"Especially when they are such flowers as I possess,"
returned the fond father, taking her hand and placing~

"That compliment is just as sweet as my darling
papa," she said, as they passed out together.
The hall in which the young barrister, James Mere-
dith, was to speak was large, brilliantly illuminated,
and decorated with the first spring flowers, wreathed
with sprays of arbor vitve, which hung in graceful gar-
lands all around the spacious apartment. It was well
filled with the youth and beauty of the town, Yirrayed in
their finest apparel. The English gentleman and his
daughter were honored with pleasant seats, and in
which the young lady's charms were shown to the best
advantage. Nor was my grandfather ashamed of the
fair young creature that was seated beside him, oh! no;
on the contrary, lie was both pleased and proud, as on
every side lie met glances of admiration cast upon her:
and if my mother (for you must know by this time
that the pretty girl was i~o other than she, for I would
not be tasking~ myself to tell you of Peol)le who lived
and loved before I was born unless I ~yas deeply inter-
ested in them, and who could I be more interested in
than in my parents?) showed to advantage, my father

of B , or out of it, was such an oration listened to
~vith such attention and marked approval. And as the
bouquets of beautiful flowers fell upon the stage, my
mother snatched the tiny blossom from her own sunny
hair and threw it at his feet, where lie singled it out

gracefully lif acknowledgement, :iinl l)lace(l it in his
bosom.
I am not going to linger long~o ver my parents' court-~
ship, for, since the days of Adam, the sameness in
courtships makes all, except your own particular one,
tiresome. Suffice it to say that, ifl their ease the course
of true love ran smoothly enough; for my grandfather
liked and admired the o'enius, and was far too
indulgent to his favoY~ite child to deny her one single
wish. So, eighteen months from the ~iglit of which I
have just spoken, they ~vei~e marrie(l. My grandfht.h er
lived "but a short tim~e after the happy pair were
and my mother left his city home in London an(l eai~e
to the little cottage where I was born, and which, aft er
many years of absence, is stilt so dear to me from t ~e
memories of the past. There, ~Uj) to the age of thirteen ~,
I spent my happiest days. My parents were (levo~ ~d
to their only child, and spared me every possible pain,
and often in my troubles through life have I looked
back on those bright, bright years ~ith a weary longing
for theii' returil.
At thirteen my sorr&amp;s began-an early age, truly,
for a heart to learn woe-and those whom. I most dearly

to fall, covering the little yard
a variegate(l carpet, riistlino' softly

with cacli passing breeze. O~i the evening
of, a day in the year 18~-, which stan(lS out very
plaii~ly to my memory, my mother drew her chair
to the cheerful fire, and ('ast an anxious glance at the
soft grey of the sky, wondering why her husl)and did
not return. He had been absent for some days, called
away on urgent business. 11cr face was sad and very
thoughtful, but, oh ! so tender and loving that the
anxiety depicted 011 it made me love her more, and
running to her, J asI~e(l: "What troubles you, dear
mother?" and as I spoke I saw the tears coming into
her soft blue eyes.
"My little son," she ans~vered, tenderly, laying my
head on her boSom, "there is a great weight here (plac-
ing her l~and on her heart), a weight that is crushing
me, and I have a presentimeiit of corning evil."

his shOlll(lel' a; he aflswcre(l with a groan of pain.
Frightened a!1(l troubled, I hastened to him and caught
his liami in my own. Never had .1 felt such a burnirv~
palm. it horrified me.  ~cver shall I forget it, or the
l)icture my y~tre;its presented. My father, with hi.~
noble brow contracted with deep pain, leaning hit;
throbbing head on my mother's slender shoulder, whilst
she, with eyes wild with despair and arms clasped con~
vulsively around him, wept as only a loving wife
can weep at seeing death written upon the face of
her husband. I StOO(1 mute and motionless, not know-'
ii~g, and yet don't know, which I felt for most, my
father passing away whilst yet in the prime of life, or
my poor sorrow-stricken mother. After a few moments
my father Sj)Ol{C:
"Dear wife~" sai(l he, "do not grieve; cease weep-

"Hush, oh! hush; do not say that you are going t~
leave me," sobbed my mother. "You will not, shall
not leave me. Do not say those awful words again or
they will kill me. Oh, my merciful Saviour, do not

She st01)ped suddenly in her wild cry, for she saw

CHAPTER III.
JOHN MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OP IllS COUSINS.
T be tired of- me, dear friends, for I must
reduce myself to you right often before my
story finishes.
My life, though dark and stormy, has had
its gleams of sunshine here and there to brighten it, as
~sometimes we can catch a glimpse of- heaven's blue
when the sky is o'ereast with the heaviest, blackest
'clouds, and the bright flashes of electricity illumi-
nating the scene makes us ,oblivious for the moment
of the gloominess of the path it travels.
It was only darkness to me everywhere when my
mother was laid to sleep, and as I. threw myself upon
the new-made grave with a cry of agony and pain, I
thought my heart was breaking. And why didn't it?
I have asked myself since. If it only had, what a life
of sorrow would have been spared me. With nay face
buried in my hands and my heart in my mother's coffin,
I leaned upon. the cold clay, with the evening sunbeams
playing through the trees, making cheerful all things
except nay young life. "Mother, will you never come
back?" I asked again and again, and each time the dis-
tant hills echoed never. Gradually, in addition to the
pain of being forever separated from her, a sense of
loneliness and want came over mc, and I began to real-
ize that I was indeed alone, with no kind friend to help
me, when a hand was gently placed on my shoulder,
and a low voice said:

OR,. RETRIflUTION.
"Don't be so sad, my child. You shall come with
mc and I will take care of you.".
I rose from my kneeling posture, and confronted a
richly dressed and handsome gentleman. I was too
young then and too deeply grieved to think of much,
but his elegant dress struck my fancy instantly, and for
a moment I forgot that II stood by my mother's last~
resting place, so completely lost in wonderr at the
beautiful dress, with its great, shining buttons, brilliant
studs, massive chain, and beautiful shirt frills. I thought
I had never seen anything so magnificent before, and
almost fancied myself in the presence of some prince
from fairy land. The enchantment was broken by the
gentleman taking my hand and saying:
"My poor little boy, you have suffered a great loss;
but come with me and I will take you to my pretty
home and try to make you happy. I am your cousin,
Sir Clarence Graham, your mother's only living rela-
two and now your protector. Come quietly away;
this is not a good place for you; it will make you think
too much of your poor mother."
r1?l~c latter -part of this speech I thought very unkind.
\~rlV should I not think of~ahy nxt-her ~? Though I
was much embarrassed at being in the presence of so
great a. person as Sir Clarence, still I was not too much
so to say: "I will think of my mother as much as I
want to. Wasn't she my mother and didn't she love
me more than any one else?" Here I completely
broke down and sobbed so violently that my cousin
became alarmed.
"Don't cry," he said, soothingly; "it will make you

sick, ai~d you won't be able to take the long jour1~ey
that is before you. Come now," and taking my hand
in his, lead me baek to my home.
It did not take Sir Clarence long to make arrange-
ments for our departure, for he seelue(1 anxious to be
gone, whilst I was thinking of the two graves in the
~quiet churchyard and clinging to each old servant a.;
they gathered around to bid the little o1'l)hIaIi go:4-
bye, as if their kind hands could keep me forevei' lILNlP
the place where my mother and father rested.
" This won't do, my boy," said Sir Clarence,, rather
hastily, as Im saw me sobbing on the neck of my old
nurse, whilst she, in broken accents, was lamenting my
departure. "This won't do,. lids ww~'i (10," lie kept
repeating as he took me by the hian(I and led me away.
"Come, clii Id, come, we do not want to be all night
*     traveling. Xou must come sometime and ,just as well
now as any other."
And so I went away, parted from my native land
and that little honv~ that had been my 'shelter from
*     infancy,, where the wild rose and honey-suckle, climb-
*     ing over the lattice formed such a sweet and rustic pie~
hire, whilst all around spoke of peace and quiet, love-
liness and repose.
I leaned from the carriage window as I heard my
old Scotch terrier whine after mc, and as I did so, the
big white eat sprang upon the gate Post with a mew,
intended, I thought, for a farewell; even the chickens,
ducks and geese flew after the vehicle; as if to bid adieu
to their little master, and as my eyes caught a last
g~impsc of the great trees that surrounded my home,

white sails were visible, I laid my head down in the
corner of the earria~e and wept myself to sleep.

I was both heart-sore and weary as the evening
a(IVUflCe(l, an(l bad i~egiin to wonder how I could live
with Sir Clarence if lie never spoke to me, when he
suddenly raised liislead and ~ome~vbat startled me by
asking:
"Are you tired, child?
"Yes," I answered, " very tired."
"I am sorry," was the brief reply, as he continued
his reading. What a queer man, I thought. I would
like to know what lie finds so interesting in that paper.
Maybe lie can't speak much English. Mamma told
me he lived in Ireland. I continued thinking a great
deal, looking all the time at my cousin, till at length
he laid down his papa' and asked:
"Well, John, how do you think you will like living
in old Ireland?"
"Ii don't know," II answered ; " wiji I have to live

"Yes, I Suppose so,'? he r&amp;urned ; " but I think
you will like it when you see my little girls and get

"Little girls !" I said. "Where arc they? Why
have you little girls?"
"Ahi ! faith, that I have," lie answered, smiling;

"And does he not call you his beauty, too ?" I
asked, wondering how he could think anything love-
her than the little brown-eyed girl that ~vas bewitdv.

"No, he just calls me Nita, that's my name, you
kn~ow."
"No, I didn't know; but it's very pretty, but not
sweet enQugh for you. Why don't they call you
something beautiful, something that Would suit you?"
"Oh, I think my name suits me exactly, but you
call me as many sweet names as you~ please in papa's
stead. But look how late it's getting, and ~ an(l
Eleanor are at the house by this time" (for we had bee:r
standing still~ since our conversation, bega u),"cornelet's

a young antelope, and I 'found myself ~ut of breath
before I knew it.
"Oh!" she said, laughing, "you are tire(l already,
and your face is right red from runnilig. Why, you
ain't half as smart as IL am. Now just see if you can

keep up ~vith me. I [crc IL go," and suiting the action
to the word, she sprang 0ff like an arrow, nor did she
4op till she was fairly seated on the steps of the
mansion.
I felt really ashamed, beingTheaten by a little girl
iiot\jl5 01(1 as myself and wou!(l have seated myself
under OUC of the trees but she calle(l me, saying
"Come here, John, and sit by me. You arc angry
with me, and I am sorry, but then, you know, you are
smarter than I am in every other way but running.
I am no bigger than a sparrow, and fly instead of run;
but we must not get angry with each other, for that
won't be nice."
"No, indeed," I answered, "I COIII(lfl't get angry
with you, and everything you do is right." I was
about to add more, when looking up I saw Eleanor.
I thought I had never seen such haughtiness, but she
was very beautiful.
"Is that our cousin?" she asked, "that ugly thing?
Whtita nice time we'll have showing him off! "
"I-lush ! oh, hush ! Eleanor," said the little girl,
starting up, " don't say that, please, doii't; John is a
real nice, good boy."

a toss of her stately head; "we will be (Itlite proud of

her than you'll ever be with all your beautiful drcss~
lug ; " for, child as I was, Ii had noticed that Eleanor
was both bcco:n i ugly and handsomely dressed, whilst
her little sister wore oliiy a J)lain pink gingham with-
out (lecoratioa or ornament.
~Xro~i are an ilnpu(lent, ill-bred' boy," she cried,
flushing with auger, " to dare to speak to me jn that
manner. You had better remember, you little beggar,
~~'hat you say in future."
"Little beggar .' " I said, ri~iug and advancing towards
her; "you cafl mc a beggar? why, I could buy and sell
yeu, and do you think I am afraid of you or what you
say?"
8he statuned her foot with rage, but seeing my deter~
mined, unflinching stand, she took her little sister by
the hand, saying "You shall never again ~)lay with
this young savage," and walked away, taking the little
girl with her;
And this is how I first met my cousins. One of
them I had already learned to love, for her s~vectness,
amiability, and free, easy manners had attracted me
irresistibly towards her. The other I scorned, diShike(l,
and felt that I almost hated, though I thought her very
beautiful; still, she was so repulsive that I felt I could
never feel a friendship for her. I was still thinking of
them, and wondering if I must enter the house, when
I heard my cousin Clarence ordering a servant "to
hunt mc up and 1)ring inc to hum, for I must be hun-
pry." The kind manner in which the order was given
brought tears to my eyes, and by the time die servant.
reached m~ I was so1)bing bitterly.

"What! crying, honey?" asked the old man, as lie
rook my hand; "there, therq, darl~nt, dry your eyes
and co~nO to your supper, and you'll be all the better
for it."
"I don't want any supper," I cried, "juSt 1 inc
sit here."
"I know you feel very lonesome, my little boy, and
sorro~vful, too ~ but come ~o your supper, child, or the
master won't like it."
I allowed him to take my hand and lead me away
into the dining-room. I was completely dazed by the
brightness of the silver-plate and the gaudy colors on
the delicate china. I felt like a fish out of water when
I seated myself; ev~n the beautiful lamps attracted me
with the figures of w~od nymphs wreathing fern leaves
to place on their graceful heads. The pictures, too,
were magnificent and richly colored, and I noticed
particularly the richly carved side-board with its mar-
ble top. I was 50 i)usy looking at all this splendor
that I forgot the presence of the family at the table
until little Nita, who had moved her chair close to' me,
said: "Do eat, do eat something, Johnnie; I know
you must be hungry, now, are you not?" and she
placed a hot light roll on my plate.
"Yes, I ani right hungry," and was soon feasting on
the good things with which my cousin Clarence's table
was plentifully supplied, though there Eleanor sat, my
u~s~a-vis, looking haughtier and more scornful than
ever, and doing everything bitt positively making faces
at me. On her right sat another lad~y, whom Nita
informed me was Eleanor's French governess, "and


they like each other very much," she continued, "and
you ought not to make an ei~e~~y of her, for it would
be so disagreeable for you." ~ ~vas not a11o~~ed to
say much during meal times, ~ when Sir Clarence
made th~ si~u to depart, she rose hurriedly, stole her
little hand into mine and whispered, "Come, now; I
will show you all my pots." Away we went, first to
the dog kennel, where the lazy quadrupeds were sleep-.
ing away, bat, on our near approach, grumbled and
growled until they recognized their young mistress,
when they j unipecl and fairly danced for joy at the very
sight of her. After we had given them their supper,
we walked to see the birds, who had their pretty heads
tucked away under their wings and too fast asleep to
mind our approach. So onward we wont, from one
thing to another, till the bell sumnioned us to retire,
and the first kiss that was ever imprinted on my lips
by a little girl was pressed there that night, and I
went to sleep and dreamed of it.

CHAPTER IV.
JOhN MAKES A. DISCOVERY.

*        WAS very soon like one of the family in
~ my &amp;ousin's house, (10mg pretty much as I
~ pleased, 1)eing the only boy, and not a very
~ naughty one, as I heard Sir Clarence say one
day. This speech flattered me to such an extent, that
I made every exertion to appear to the best advantage.
Little Nita was my constant companion, and never
did little boy and little girl get along so well together.
* Our leisure hours were employed catching fish from
the silvery Shannon, playing hide and seek, making
soap bubbles which were borne upon the air, reflecting
the rays of the sun in t~eh seven glorious colors, and
in every other amusem6iitlvhich childish fancy could
think of or dictate.
I do not think that Eleanor was pleased at our hap-.
piness. She would often pass us in our sports, east
upon us a look of supreme contempt, and go on with-.
out uttering a word. We tried to avoid her as much
as possible. I never liked he" but for Nita's sake,
-,   ,
always treated her respectfully, though at times it was
very hard to (10 so, when I saw the rude, rough man-.
ner in which she treated her little sister. Often I
would be on tIme point of breaking out into a reproach,
when a look of appeal from Nita would hush me
instantly.
I one day made a discovery when I had been at
my cousin's for six or eight months, which equally sur~

breath on my cheek, and turning, found Nita, with her
large brown eves fixed 111)011 the j)Ortrait. I started up,
looked from ihe picture to the little girl, and not till
then did I discover the reseniblanee.
" Nita, was that your mother? " I asked.

Oh a great, great deal. Conic," and takir~g my

"Now, tell me," I said, "why have you acted so
curiously? That must be your mother, for you are
exactly like her."
"Y&amp;s John that is my mother, but (10 not let papa
know I ever told von. lIe does not want me to know,
and pne evening I heard old Patrick say that little
Nita's mother was a much lovelier person in every way
than Lady Eleanor's. IL ran to papa and asked if
Eleanor and I were not sisters? 'To be sure you are,
you foolish child. Go away an(l never come to inc

much annoyed and when I, was leaving him he called
me back and said: 'What made you ask me that,
child?' I told him what I had heard Patrick say.
You know when papagets angry lie gets very angry,

she inherits all this from her plebeian mother. I
might have known that it would be impossible to
reffue her. She will never make a (lecent entry into
society, never. Out if she were only ?like her sister.
What a superb girl Ekanor is, with so much o'ood,
taste, exquisite penetration, and sodio~nified and stately.
I have Just reason to be proud of her, and for having
hera for my companion, for she inibibes all my fiuucW3
and tastes thoroughly--a fine girl, a fine girl."
But whilst Sir Clarence was thinking all this, whV
did he not think also, that it was owing to his ncgkct
and his oldest daughter's statements that Ii i~ younger
child appeared to such disadvantage. She ~vas neither
inferior nor weak-minded. On the contrary, si uc was
high4oncd, with chaste and beautiful tastes, a Ii ighly-,
gifted mind and bright an(l striking ideas e~i~bi~~d
with much simplicity, generosity and gentleness of
nature, which bore a striking contrast, and which was
very agreeable to the haughtiness, amounting to rude..
ness, and imperiousness of Eleanor.
One evening, a circumstan&amp; occurred which appeared
propitious to Nita's future happiness; but, unhappily,
fkvorable circumstances to-day may be counteracted by
ynf'av'orable &amp;ncs to-morrow. On this particular even-
ing, Mta and I were dying kites in the yard and play-
ing about as usual. She was in a most gleeful humor,
and seemed, by her exuberance of spirits, to have
infused her cheerfulness and gaiety into me, for never
did I feel so full of fun and Pleasure. I had given her
kite a lift on a strong breeze which had just sprang up,
and called to her to run and see bow it wouhi sail on

the aiL' like a lU1(rC l)ird. She sprang off instantly, and
liet' little light fi~'et seemed fairly to fly as she ran
tI~~o~~0h thc )LUd with the flying kite. d tried to keep
up with her, but might as well have tried to keep up
with the young auitelope, and I ha(l to stop for breath.
l;('iIig iie~ii' the steps of the 1)alcony, I seate(I myself to
admire her swiftness and graceful little form ; a slight
noise caused me to look around, a~id I saw Sir Clar-
enee, Flean(W and the Ercuiehi governess watching Nita
~also. 1 saw by the expression of Sir Clarence's face
that he was admiring his little (1au~11ter.
"1 declare, he length said, " she's as 0-race-
ful as a gazelle. Why, her f~et scarcely toudi the
ground. But, ab ! there, the string has broken. Poor
little fairy, how disconsolate she looks. She is scarcely
larger than a humming l)ird, she is so tiny."
At this point,.Nita camP running up, and stooped to
pick up a little guinea ~g which her father hal given
her sonic days before, and to which she seemed devo-
tedly attached. As she was about' to seat herself beside
me, with the guinea hugged tightly to her breast, her
father leaned towards her, and said:
"Are you tired, little girl ?"
"A little bit, papa," she answered, laughing, going
up to him; "Did you see my kite?"
here Eleanor interposed
"Why, papa, ouP would think you never saw a kite
fly before. I'm sure it's very easy to do.
"Oh, yes, yes, (laughteV, he answered, "it~s. easy
enough, I know. how is the little guinea coming
on?" turning to Nita.

She was about to answer when Eleanor said : "(live

INita, ~itliout a word, placed it in her arms. She

~ue~h force against a marble pillar close by, that it i~}I
upon the marble floor, gave two or three faint moans,
while one or two convulsions j)assed over its little body,
and then lay quiet and dead.
A cry of pain burst from Nita's white lips, while the
tears dreamed from her beautiful eves.
"Ah, my poor little guinea ! m~iy poor little gui~mea
Sister Eleanor, why did von do it ~ Alt ! j)apa, 18 it

"Yes~ my child,', he answered, half sorrowfully,
taking her hand ; "yes, it is dead, but papa will give
von another one very soon."
Turning to Eleanor, he said:
"You have pained me' very much, my daughter, by
giving way to your temper in such an unladylike
manner. Try, hereafter, Lo have more control over
yourself." lie then stooped and kissed Nita's fore-
head and drew her away with him. I followed, and
we bent our steps towar&amp;s the river. During the rest
of the evening, Sir Clarence devoted, himself to us,
Jiared in our am'~ements, related the most wonderful
tales for our entertainment, and altogether we had a
most charniin~ time. ~ita was inexj)rCSsiblr happy.

Never before hind her father displayed such clernonstra~
tious of affection fbi' her, his neglected little girl.
Whmemi the I)ell rang that night for us to retire, my cousin
kissed his younger child in a tender, fiitherly manner,
calling her his little darling, and asked God to bless
her. Me, also, lie kissed in a kind, caressing way, bid-
ding mc be a good boy an(l to get up early, and we
would all three go fishing on the river in the morning.
I left his study, in which we had been lately sitting,
and, boy-like, went 1)oIlnditIg up stairs to my chamber.
Just as I was about to lay my hafl(l on th~ knob of the
door, I felt a soft touch on my shoulder, and ~ita
whispered, "Oh, Johnnic, I'm so happy." Then, kiss-
ing my cheek, she ran off hurriedly in an cestacy of
joy, an(l I, big, foolish, boy, went to bed and wept ~vith
happiness at the good fortune of the little girl whom I
so dearly loved. And this good fortune and excessive
happiness lasted only for one short week, during which
time Sir Clarence had us with him constantly. lie
~)1aye~l ball with us and took us long walks through
the fields, told us marvelou* tales of furies, genii,
dwarfs and hobgoblins, rode with us on our ponies, and
in all our sports he was partaker. During these short
seven days Eleanor was the most miserable person II
ever knew. She trembled for fear Nita would rival
her in her father's love. There was another motive,
too. Eleanor was both selfish and covetous, and the
presents which Sir Clarence gave to his young daugh-
ter during that week were looked upon by her with the
greatest envy; and, day after day she wondered how
she eould, with her wiles amid artifices, misrepresent

You have displeased me beyond me~isiire."
"And you, Miss Nita, have behaved quite as badly
as your cousin. You should be ashamed of yourself.
See what you have made your sister suffer. I never
heard of such conduct and such. unladylike behavior."
"But, father," cried the child, "I did not hit Elca-.

"Well, well, my daughter," began Sir Clarence,

addressing the Prench governess of ~he little girl,
"take this pupil ~of yours and lock her up in the small

he continued, as he saw something like reluctance in
the kind woman's face, "I wish and will be, you under-

The woman bowed, and taking Nita'5 hand, left the
room.
"INow," said Sir Clarence, turning to me, "go to my

"Certainly," thought I, as I found myself seated by

I had little time for reflection, for iii a very few min-

After this, I was sent to undergo the same punishment

answer. "Nita!" I said,' in a louder voice, "come

JollY IS FULL GROWN".

DO not intend to linger over Nita's and my
thonoli itwasb
eIlih:hoo(1,           ~ far the hal)l)iest
~c~~portion of my long, weary life. I was a
happy, Joyous boy then, but now a sad,
sorrowful man. I could, if I did not have coni-
passion on my readers, relate event after ev~nt of
pleasure which happened in my boyhood to little Nita
and myself. There were, too, hours of sadness am:id
disgrace for both of us; but our troubles were of short
duration, for if we were locked up for some trivial
offemise, which was frequently the case, since Eleanor
never tired of misrepresentingg us,'just allow us to peep
at each other through the keyhole or some window a~d
we were happy, and took our punishment with th~ best
l)OSSible grace.
I am. very much afraid, my friends, by the time you
have read to this chapter, you will have beco e very
tired of the joys and sorrows of two children, and will
hmavesaid with much irritation, "I do wish John and
Nita would grow up. We have had quite enough of
them." So, in compliment to you, though it is with a
"feeling akin to pain7' I pass over a period of 'seven
years, which made me a man aiid Nita a woman, and,
oh! such a fair graceful woman. Her light figure li-ad
lost none of that ease and swiftness of motion, blended
with the most perfect grace, that was peculiar to her
alone; and her lovely eyes, so soft and expressive, lit-'

rally spoke every emotion of her heart. It would he
folly for me to say that there were none as lovely as
Nita. I do not intend going so far. She was lovelier
than any one else in the workl to me, though others dif-'
fered from me very often. She ~vas, ho~vever, admired
extravagantly rind loved by all, and thought much more
attractive and inningn, although not as beautiful as
Lady Eleanor. I once heard an English Countess
remark that she would willingly give her rich estates
for Nita Graham's eyes, and did she but possess them,
she could and would make the whole world bow before
her; and on the same evening, a gentleman said to me:
"That little cousin of yours is exceedingly lovely,
though one must kno'v her before he can fully appre-'
ciat~ h~r beauty. Her face, at first, does not strike you
as being so beautiful as Lady Eleanor's, but after a few
moments' conversation you quite change your mind.
I never saw eyes that so mirrored one's heart." And
such remarks I was continually hearing. Eleanor took
good care that Nita sho'ild see as little of society as
possible when her vanity allowed her to notice the
effect she produced.
But the time came at length when iNita must make
her appearance in public.
"Nita is quitQ old e~noughi," Sir Cla~cnce remarked,
when the question was discussed, "and a very sweet,
pretty little girl she is, too. Yes, she must make her
debut this fall; that's settled."
When her father spoke so posi~tively, Eleanor could
only pout her ~)retty lips and remain silent. I think I
mentioned that Eleanor inherited a large estate at her

mother's death; which brought her annually a largc
income. But this great aliount wa~ scarcely sufficient
to satisfy~her demands. Poor Nita never saw a cent of
it, and was dependent upon her father's generosity for
the little orna:ncnts she owned. One evening' T over-
heard her remark to, her waiting-maid
"I'n1 sure, Charlotte, when I (10 go to Lady A- 's
ball (thi~ was to be Nita's ball) I will feel mighty
shabby. I won't look at all like a nobleman's daugh-
ter, and Madam Blanche seems to think my wardrobe
quite good enough for mc~. Why, I have iiot a suitable
set of jewelry even, and I, wouldn't ask papa, for he
has been so generous to me lately that I fear he, would
think my wants will never be supplied. I am sure I
will feel very badly. 'But what can't be cured must
be endured,' " antI she commenced humming an air,
seeming to forget fn an instant her difficulties.
I went down stairs muttering, "Oh, this is the way,
is it? Well, it shan't be so always."
I had a call to London a week before the ball. on
pressing business. After rhy engagement was concln-
dccl, I found myself in the great city with nothing to
do but to, think of Nita. ,And as I walked down the
busy streets, I remembered That I had heard her sPeak
of not having a suitable set of jewelry for the ball.
My eyes wandered from store to store~ until at length
11 saw the one I most wished for. I entered; the
1)rio'htest gems were before ~ uy~; for a I uut~ i was

would be acceptable 'to Nita, and shortly after bade adieu
to Merry lEngland and was sailing across the Channel.
I found Nita, on my arrival, in the conservatory,
watering a row of Nile lilies which she claimed as her
special property. She did not hear my footsteps, and
my arms were around her before she was aware of my
l)rescnce.
"Oh, I am. so glad, so very glad, you have come,
John! I hav~ been real lonesome. You don't know
what a difference your absence makes~ It don't seem
like home without you."
A thrill of exquisite joy passed through me at these
words, ~nd as I saw truth written in every lineament
of her lovely face, my heart throbbed with a pleasun~
that I never felt before.
"And you really missed,1me, Nita? Why, I didit't

"Oh, you 01(1 hoax," she answered, laughing, "you
know very well I missed you. Aint you just as good
as you can be, and who thinks of giving me one

She turned away her head to hide a tear that was

last words.
"After awhile, Nita, you won't think so much of
me. You will, be in other company, and theN will be
new scenes and new faces to divert you, whilst I'll be
here alone, sadly wishing that the time had never
come when others could give you pleastni'e and when
you would not look to me for every enjoyment."
"What do you mean?" she said, very much startled,
"Am I going anywhere that I won't be with you?

"No, '1 answered, "but you are going into fashion-
able society, where you will 'be flattered and caressed,
and by some loved; but there will be others, Nita, who
will frown upon you, and jealousies will arise that will
make your life almost unbearable; but then, again,
there will be an excitement which you will relish and
which you will not be willing to relinquish for the
quiet joys of home."
~
vvny," she answered, ~suiiling, "you speak most
gloomily of this life that I am doonwd to lead. I'm
sure it will nof be so dreadful. Speak more, eheeringly
for pity sake, or I will despair of ever having a peace-
ful moment."
"Oh, I trust it won~t be quite as' bad as that; but
experience is the best of masters."
We. had been walking while we were speaking, and
had entered thc parlor just as I had finished my last
speech.
"No~v," I Said, "give me one more little ballad
while we arc here alone, for next week )ou will be lit-
tle, with me, and whilst you are away will forget how
dearly I love to hear you sing."
"I will never forget either your likes or dislikes,"
she answered, as she seated herself at the instrument
and began a low, simple melody.
When she had finished, she turned to inc and said:
'KJohn, how can you say that I will forget you? you
who have ever been my best friend. jYou know my
life would have been a poor, lonely one if it had not
been for you; and you to say I will forget you! I
never can or will."

"Neither have I forgotten you, my little cousin," I
said, as I laid the sparkling jewels before her. "This
you will accept as a little token of my remembrance."
"0! are these for me?" lifting the beautiful stones
from the soft ye] v&amp; and looking at them more closely.
"Oh, these are lovel, m~ignificent! John, did you get
these for me? and did you think of me whilst you
~~~ere in 01(1, bustling London?"
'~ Indeed, I did-there and everywhere."
"Well, what shall I say to thank you?" she asked,
looking up into my eyes.
"Not a word," stooping an4 kissing the blushing
cheek, "not a word; only wear them for my sake at
Countess A~'s ball."
"Yes, indeed, that I shall; but you ask little return
for such a superb present. I want to do more for you.
What shall it be?"
"That is all I ask now, dear Nita," I answered,
'~ though perhaps in the future I shall be more extrav-
agant in my requests."
"You are a dear, (lear cousin," she whispered, "and
you can never ask too much of me or more than I will
be willing to do," an&amp; throwing her arms around my
neck in the old childish way, she told me again that I
was her dearest friend.
Oh, if I cohld only have claimed her then! flut
no, no. It was ordained otherwise, and I try to believe
that it was for the best, and that our Creator knoweth
what is for our good, aiid dealeth most mercifully with
gven the weakest of His children. My conscience would
not allow me to tell her then of all my love, "No,"

it said, ~' dou~t be selfish; let her see something of the
world; do not injure her now by exacting a prornis~
that she will be yours; you may be very sorry if' you
do, for she loves you only as a brother. Wait." "Yes,
yes," I said, with a sigh, which attracted her attention.
Why, John, you arc sighing, whilst I am so happy.
Why, what is the matter?"
"Here, while 117 am with you, dear Nita, you aro suf~
ficient for my happiness."
"0, you 01(1 flatteP~r, to say such a thing! You
dear old flatterer," she repeated, laughing. "But I
hadn't seen how becoming n~y jewels are. Now, l5ok
while I p~it them on, and see if I am not pretty.
Don't laugh, for I want to look dignified. Oh, ar~
they not becoming!" she said ,as she caught them up
to her bright, yoting face and glanced in the large mir-
ror opposite. "~ Won't I eclipse everybody?" she went
on playfully, "and don't you think some one will fall
in love with me, and perhaps, too, John, might marry
me? Then, I wonder if papa would feel just a little
sorry when h~ should not ~ee little Nita abont the
house, though he does think me such a trouble? And
Eleanor, maybe, would be repentant for not letting papa
love mc as much as he does her. You are the only
one that* I know would be sorry," coming up to me
and laying her hand on my arm, "and my greatest
regret would be to leave you, John."
I turned away and left the rooip, for the bare thought
of losing her sent a bitter sorrow to my heart's core.

LIE long lOOke(l for, and much talked of;
night of' the ball at length arrived, when
Nita was to make her debut. For the whole
day preceding it, everything was in the
utmost confusion. I could not catch a glimpse of
the young lady till towards evening, when I was
fortunate enough to see her long enough to ask
what dress she would wear on the great occasion.
"Oh! the drcss papa gave me-white silk with your
emeralds, (10 you think I will look pretty?"
"Lovely ! " I said1, in return.
"Well good-bye, until you see me looking so," she
answered, as she ran lightly away, "then you can pay
rn ~ as many complimci~ts as you l)lease, for I will have
ti tue to listen."
In the evening, at half-past nine, we were to start
fc r Countess A's, where a large ~tnd select party were
ili.Vite(1 to receive Niki. It was quite dark when the
two girls came down to get into the carriage. I
noticed that Nita, though I could not sec her face, was
sad and very silent. I did not ask the cause think-
ing perhaps that the novelty of the occasion alarmed
her, and, without having spoken half a (lozen words,
we arrived at the Countess', where introductions, and
little ceremonies too numerous to mention, were gone
through with. My two cousins, on the arms of my
Lords, whose names I have long since forgotten, were

ushered into the great hall. Murmurs of admiration
greeted these lovely girls on every side, and their
entirely different styles attracted universal attention.
I soon saw my little Nita in the gay dance, with a
crowd of admirers flocking aro~ind her. I was hurt
and vexed when Ii saw that my presei~t was discarded,
for she did ijot wear the jewels I had thought so much
of; and which would have made her look so attractive.
Whilst wondering why this was, I acchkntally caught
sight of them in a brilliant blaze of light on the neck
and arms of Eleanor; and how beautiful they were,
and how lovely they made~er appear. I, had never
seen her half so lovely as she was this night. I was
so much worried for a while, that Iii ceased to look
towards either of my cousins, and tried to forget them
entirely, as I sa~v they had no need of a' faithful
watcher. I soon left the crowded hail and went to
one of the verandas, and seating myself; thought of the
injustice practiced upon me by Kita. I felt it very
keenly, and was fast making myself vei'y miserable,
when I was touched on my arm. Looking up, I saw
his hi.
a young gentleman, who, in irry, forgot to intro-
duce himself; but who seemed to be well acquainted
with me.
"Mr. Meredith, please introduce me to your younger
cousin, she is so bewitchingly beautiful."
"If you ~will honor inc with your name, sir,, I will
do so," Ii answered, coldly.
"OhJ beg you will excuse me," he answered," your
lovely relative has made me quite forget my politeness.
Arriving after your party, I was denied the pleasure
pf beir~ one of the first who~ were introduced."

Pleased with the address of-This young ma-n, I arose
instantly after hearing his name, and accompanied him
to the dancing saloon. Ii found Nita with several gen~
ticinen who were all requesting the l)leaslll'e of a set
with her. She saw me advancing' 'md came forward
a few steps to meet me. I introduced Sir Charles
Stuart, and in a few moments left him talking to Nita
in a mhnner which was altogether very ~epos~sing
and attractive. I went back again to my lonely seat on
the veranda, continuing my dispiriting wondering why
N~ta should have treated me thus, an(l thinking of the
handsome young Scotch man I had just prCsCl)ted to
her. All seemed so dark to me then, that with a
weary yearning, 1 longed for my boyhood to come
again, when she was all my own. Ii shuddered as I
looked to the future, and ~felt what it had in store for
me. As I ~at thus' musing, Nita and Sir Charles
passel out and joined a throng of promenaders on tI e
balcony. A thrill of jealousy shot through me, an(l
* when I saw by the moonlight the bright, lu stromis eyes
looking into his, and the soft smile wreathing her lips,
I determined to bear it no lono'er. Remembering that
my cousin had warned rue not to stay out late, but to
let corn muon sense make me come early, I looked at my
watch, and finding it long after miclnio'ht started to
b
seek Eleanor, to suggest to her that we had better
leave. Of ~c~urse, she was the one to say Yes or No to
our going. I found her almost alone, and was pleased
to see by her tired look that she would be willing to
depart. She had not received the usual amount of
attention that was generally allotted her, the "little

* sister" having already l)egun to ccli pse ber. "Where
is Nita?" she asked; "call her, if you please, and we
will go.'U This was soon (lone, for F did 'not like to
see Nita wi~1i this gentleman. I felt a presentiment
of coming evil when I thought of those two together.
We were not long in. preparing and were soon on our
way home. Nita talked all the time of how charm.
Sir Stuwt 'md
ingly she spent the evening, an(l of    ,    tol(l
US that she hati 1)rGmiSed to allow imini to visit her.
This was a new pa in, for I wa~ very Jealous of this Sir
Charles, whose gentlenma nly mapnei's and agreeable
appearance were so striking. I had only known hin
two or three hours, and was, in troth, obliged '
acknowledge that he was the most at tractive gent I ~-
man, I had ever met.
"What. did you think of him, iBleamior? "
"I (lid not have the pleasure of an introduction, Ii it
as you ~eem to think so, I suppose he must be over-
poweringly fascinating."
So6n after this scornful speech, we reached home,
and for the first time since I had come to live under
my COUSi n's roof; I retired to my chamber without
kissing Nita good night. In a little while Sir ,~lar-
ence came in to learn tl~e events 6f the evening. I
told him all about the ball, anti could.~ not help men-
tioning that Nita had di~earded the jewels she had
Â£
promised to wear, and that they were very becoming
to Eleanor.
No doubt he saw that I Was deeply hurt, for at the
br~ akfast table, next morning, after telling his younger
child how proud he was of her (all parents are proud

of their cli ildren if 1y the world admired, and so it was
with my cousin), asked;
"What did my little Italitin wear that macic her so
captiVatin~ 'p"
Eleanor had always managed it so that Sir Clarence
sfmoukl be blind to Nita's zuany ah~irms; Jrnw she did
this, I never knew, but, strange to say, it was true.
My cousin seemed to be under the impression that
Nita was admired by no one, but this ball had the
effect of opening his eyes.
"What did I wear, papa? Why, of course, the
beautiful white silk you gave me, and your pretty
bracelets."
"Was that all the jewelry? You were certainly
modest."
No," she said, blushing, and evidently much embar-
rassed, "I wore a set of corals."
"Why," asked Sir Clarence, rather severely, "did
you not wear the set of emeralds that John was kind
enough to give you?
"Because," she stammered, and then stopped.
"Because, what?" l)ersisted the father.
I saw then what he meant, and felt sorry for her,
and ren~arked that I supposed that Nita thought they
were more l)ecomi ng to Eleanor than to herself; and
was too unselfish nQt to allow her to wear them. I
~aw the blood start into Eleanor's naturally pale face
as I said this, mA she gave me one of her old looks,
which used to alarm me when I was a boy, and I saw
that she was very inuich frightened for fear her father
would think that she had been capable of a mean

action and tkit her sister was so generous. Her father,
noticing this silent confession, sai(l
",~Why did you not let Nita wear her own
Eleanor?"
" Mhy, papa, I (lidil't think they would be a;
beconiiiig as the set of corals. You have already
h~'ard how much she was admired, ai~l I think it was
Owing altogether to my good taste in lending her the
coral set."
2      " \Ydl then " I said, anxious to get my mind
relieved, "Eleanor, you just took Nita's jewels 011(1 IV it
your's in their place without saying anything?"
Yes, I did," she answer d~ 1)ettishly ; "is it am y
of your business~ sir?"
None, whatever," I replied ; "only you put me n
mind of an anecdbte I heard once, of a man who 115 d
his valise marked with the eight of clubs, and anoth~ ~r
man came along with the nine and took it."
She said no more, for her Kither \vas present, ai~ d
before him she was always ~amiable. We wero sile~ it
during the rest of the meal, ~ir Clarence asking only
a few questions relative to the ball. After we had risen

for the day.

"Oh " she answered, "a nice row on the river, and
a soiree ~t Lady C's this~ evening. Oh! I think it
will be delight~il, and John," she added, blushingly,
"isn't Sir Charles chtirming?"
I couki scarcely bear to hear this man praised in my
~)resefl&amp;, and answering "Yes," hurriedly ran into the
hall, where I encountered Eleanor tying on ~mer hat,
making ready for, the sail.

"John, of course you are going to pilot us?" she
said, as I was p~issing on.
"It is very likely I will not, Elcanor. I have busi-
ness to attend to which I think will pre\~cI~t mc; busi-
ness always before pleasure, you know." So I staid
at hqme, U iinl~ing how miserable my life was becoming,
and wondering why did girls 1)CCOn~e women, and why
didn't we always st~iy children. I was wondering all
this, when Patrick, who was dusting the furiiiture in
my room, turned to nke, and asked
"Were you the person, Masther, who introduced my
young Misthr~ss Nita to Sir Charles Stuart'?"
"Yes," I said, looking at him in surprise, "why do
~ou ask?"                                    2
"Because," lie began, "Sir Clarence is very much
l)ut out about it; lie had n~ idea, I heard him say to
Miss Eleanor, that it was this Sir Charles you men-
tioned last evening. There seems that there has been
some misunderstanding' between Sir Clarence and this
Stuart family, and, whatever it was, Sir Clarence is
seriously displeased."
This raised my spirits wonderfully. I felt like a
new man. Perhaps, after all, I was hidulging in
imaginary trouble that would never be realized. I
arose, whistling, wi di a lighter heart than I had had
siuco Nita's debut was first spoken of. I met my cou-
sin on the landing.
"I was looking for you to telli you of the great mis-
take you made last night in introducing NitatoaStu-
art. They are the bitterest enemies of my family, and

rules of etiquette to treat him) like a gentleman, when
it would be more acceptable for me to see a. woolly~
headed African about me."
"I am sure Sir Charles" (feeling sorry for him when
I heard him unjustly spoken of) "' is quite a gentleman,
and I never have seen a more fascination~ one."
"iFascinating! That is just it," he said, interrupt-
ing me. "We will have Nita fascinated with ~him
1)re~1Itly, and theii wp will have nice acting."
"God forbid," It murmured to myself; and left the
excited old man to calm himself. Sir Clarence's ~vord~
were prophetic,' for every day I was convinced that she
was more and more enaniored of this young stranger,
although she had been told of her father's objection to
him. This dislike on Sir Claren&amp;e's part did not scum a
sufficient reason for her refusing to give him her love.
I heard afterwards that it was a very little thing which
~had made the breech between the two families.
On~ day when a party of~cquestrians had returned
from their ride, Nita being amongst them, I saw Sir
Charles, as he lifted her from the saddle, place a tiiiy
white rose-bud in her hand, and whisper, "With the
emblem." She blushed deeply as she received it, and
I saw her kiss it in suhicl~ a tender manner on her way
to hei~' room,' that my' heart ached with jealousy. But
this was only one of the "trifles that was confirmation

pered one evening after tea, laying her hand on my arm.
"Come out into the summer-h9use. T cannot tell you
here."
We went out together, and after we were seated, she
said
"I am almost afraid to tell you for fear the flowers
will run in with the newsAo p~pa."
I knew wh~.t it was, b ut said nothing.
"I must tell you though," she continued. "I would
(lie if I did not tell some one, and there is no one will
advise me as yout can."
I still 'sat silent, and she went on.
"Why don't you ask me, John? Ilave you no
curiosity?"
~(J) know what it is,  ~,   at length said
know what it is. You are engaged to Sir Charles
Stuart."
After this there was a pause for some time. After
awhile she raised her eyes to mine aiA said:
"And vbu, too, are angry with me. I knew p~pa
would be; Eleanor is not interested enough in me to
care one way or the other; but for you td be angry and

"My darling," I 'cried, "I am i~ot angry; don't
think it. What am I to do? How am I to advise
you against your father? for you know he will be-

Oh, John," she sobbed, " what am I to do? I

cannot give uj Sir Charles. It would break my heart
to be obliged to be separated from him for~ ever. And
he, too, would feel it so, keenly !
Yes, I knew he would suffer, for it did not take me
long to know that this young Scotch~uan fairly wor-
sb:ped this gil'1.
After a long silence ~he spolie~ again
"John, you will do all you can for me, won't you?
Oh, pray do, for tho love of mercy. You can make
papa become reconciled. Do, John, do. You know
you are the only friend I have. Oh, you will help mc.
Say you will, my cousin."
"My dear, kind cousin, ycs," I answered.
And thi~ was all that T could ever be to her-her
friend, her cousim-and she should never know ho~v
- this friend, this cousin, loved her! No! 'better that
my l~eart should break in silence with this great sorrow
than 'to give another pang to her gentle heart.
I walked alone in the dini starlight after she had left
me, feeling ~ts if these contending passions would drive
me mad. I knew that I could stop ~Sir Charles f~om
ever coming to the house again. All I need do was to
make known to Sir Clarence what I had j ust heard and
agree with him in disapproving of it. Then Nita
~vould be forever separated from this man, who stood
between me ai~d all*~ that this world had of happiness
for me.. And she would naturally turn to her only
friend for consolation, and Efelt that, in sympathizing 2

he brought you, a lonely little orphan, to his home,

was strong. Wo~ild I do this and secure my own hap-

young man? or would I use my influence in favor of
Sir Charles? It was a hard, bitter struggle, and I
walked on and on, with the stars t~vinkling, twinkling,

dark heavy cloud seemed to have lowerc(l
_overus all, which affected Nita very seriously.
I had spoken to Sir Clarence, and told hum
01' Nit&amp;s preference, and 1)0w worthily I thought
it was l)estowecl; but all I could say would get
from him but the pei~mission for the young lovers
to see each other occasionally; more luau this he
(leclareci should never l)e; and when I tried to
cojivince that he was both hard and unjust to
these young people, he hushed mc with a cold rebuke,
and very unceremoniously dismissed me from his pres-
ence. But a~ days passed on, and I sa~v Nita's cheek
grow pale and thin, her ligJit step heavy, and her large,
lustrous eyes lose their brightness, my conscience
reproached me, and I feared that I had not done all
for her that I could. I was becoming very scrupulous
on this point, and determined that I w&amp;uld light a hard
fight in her interest. *What hurt me most was that she
seem&amp;l to avoid me and all the family. I had seen less
of her in the last two weeks than I had done for years.
I could hardly stand this. I loved her so that I would
rather suffer anything than she should suspect inc of
not befriending her. Sometimes, in passing her chain-
ber at night, I would hear her, in soft tones, supplicat-
ing mercy from on high. One evening I was walking
~ with my fishing-rod on the banks of the Shannon. and

d5 usual was trying to forget myself and soften the
burthen that was upon me. I had walked some
lance to where two or three jarge willows hung their
huge branches over the bright waters. Underneath
their coo' sha(le I thought to rest and refresh myself
from the burning .rays of the afternoon sun In the
act of doing so I was stopped by the notes of a guitar,
accompanied by Nita's iow, musical Voice, invoking the
Blessed \irgin in the evening hymn. I stood where
th~ drooping branches concealed me from view, but where
I eQuld see her, with her soft eyes raised supplicatingly
to Heaven and those l)ul'e notes bursting' forth from
her lips. I thought I had never seen a more attrac-
live or beautiful l)ictllre. After the hymn ceased,~
she leaned forward, with her chin resting on her
hand, an (I looked pensively over the waters. iTo~
much she was like the Portrait of her mother then ! I
was half afraid of approadiing her for fear' of being
repulsed, and as I stood thoughtfully studying whether
to a(lvance or not I saw Sir Charles, with hi~ rod and
line, perhaps like myself seeking, by wandering along
the river, to lighten ~hiis grief, lie soon saw Nita,
though she was entirely unconscious of Ins presence,.
He stopped, as I had done, to gaz6 upon the lovely pie-.

that they would look with love in another face ; they
must be mine! ~dne to look at and grow. cheerful in

hard with me, as it ever does whh all its children, to

eternity."
"Yes, always yours," she murmure(1 ; " always,

I turned away, then, very sad and lonely, and ~vent
back and sat upon the veranda, waitiimg, waiting, wait-
ing, for what? I hardly knew. At last Nita came;
the rose was then upon her cheek and the 1)rightness
in her eyes. After all,, the meeting must have 'been a
joyous an(l happy one, though they were like children
groping in the dark, nut knowing where they were
going or what they would do next. I rose as she came
and went t9 her.
"Nita," II said, " will you come with mc'? I wou!d
like to speak to you."
"Is it of importance?" she asked; "if not, I would
rather you would put it off until to-morrow, as I wish
to go 'to my room now."
"As you like," I answered, and turned away in
search of Sir Clarence, and found liin in his study
hard at work on sonic papers.
" I wish you would come here and help, John. I
am up to my eyes in work, and don't know what 1
shall do unless you lend me your valuable assistance."

Finished, I looked at Sir (larence afl(l S~W that he W..is
in an excellent luimor, and felt that' this was the time
to speak.
"Sir Clarence, 1 began, '' I wish to speak to you

I/a1ia~. I think that every parent should establish
his child's happiness when it is within his reach. And
the question arises now: Will you, Sir Clarence, make
your child happy or cause her young heart to break
through an UUJ imst ~ ad ice'? Fur there is no man
more to b6 admired than this Sir Charles, ai~~ if you
would yiew this m4ter frou~ an impartial point, you
would see at once how wrong it was to vi~it 'the doings
of their forefathers upon this young couple."
He did not interrupt inc whilst I was speaking, but
looked out the window at the trees, WIII('hL were floddimig
their branches~ to and fro in the gentle summer breeze.

said
" Why is it that you plead for Nita'? Are you si

" No, Sir Clarence," I sai(l when I could master my'I
fi'cli~gs, " I am only anxious &amp;r her happiness, and I
J)elleYe that this is the only way it can be obtained.
"V/eli, then, he aflSWere(l, " if she loves this ~eoteh-
man better than her silvery-headed father, let her go
with him, but she is never to come back to me a~'aiu.
Tell her this, and tell her that she can have her mar-
riage here, where you and Eleanor can witness it. But
after that, she goes. Not another \vord, John Mere-
(lith. It is you that are sending my ehild away from
me. Take my message to her, and tell her to decj(le
between her lover and her father."
It was useless to say more then, so I left him to look
for Nita. I found her with Eleanor, which was
something strange, something that had not happened
for months, I may say years~ that these two sisters
should have a confidential talk together. I begged
pardon foriutrudiug upon them, and asked Nita if I
could see her when she had finished.
"W&amp;.~ have finished now," said. Eleanor, rising, and I
noticed that ~he had quite a siti~iietl look upon her
lace, aUd spoke more cordially than was usual with her.

I have had a conversation with Sir Clarence."
"And told him all about it, I suppose," she e~
claimed, springing up and casting a look of reproa~h
upon me.
I had hoped, Nita," I replied, "that in all these
long ear~ you would have known me better. I had
no desire, no reason, no thought, to make your inectiog

"Forgive me," she said, with tears in her eyes. "~ I

"No, I would not," I answered, hurt to the quick,

me to tell you that you could marry Sir Charles-"
"Oh! did he!" interrupting me, a~d throwing her
arms round my neck in th~ old, old way. "Oh, John,
you dear, dear cousin! You did this for me, and I

VK ~(4~! LIE marriage day caine at last. Sir Clarence
never left his study during the week before
Iti~
but to conic to his meals, which were eaten
in silence by all. Even the servants felt
the grief which prece(les the departure of the loved
One. VVe could not see that she would ever again
come back to 115. ii ad the grave opened to receive
her we could not have felt it more painfully;
and still she was going and of her own free will. Oh,
Love! what a mystery thou art, and what sacrifices
are made for thee. Here was a young girl, with the
stron(~est natural attachmentsywith a father she almost
~vorshiped, with a home that was endeared to her by
a thousand tender associations, willing, nay happy, to
forego them all for a stranger she had scarce known
three months. I did not close my eyes the night
before the day which was to take all that was dearest
in this world from me forcvcr~ I sat by the window
and watched the stars as they rose, twinkled anti
sparkled, and then I saw them slowly fade away before
the bright rays of morn.
~lie day, in the forenoon, was bright and cheering.
The marriage was not to take place till the evening,
anti the couple were to cross the Shannon at a point
nearly opposite and go direct to Scotland, which wa~
to be Nita's adopted country. As the last star had
passed away, and the sun in all his brilliant majesty

to refresh iiiy mind, and to try to siiinni~n the courage

salutation.
Me took ~i (1lliCt walk together, she the while Iaik~
ing of her marriage and looking happy nd miserable
by turns. She could not endure the thought of her
fatlji~o~j wifrrnssing the ceremony. This was a cruel
b!Jx~11hink she would have been suj)renl.cly happy
had he 1)leS5C(( her nuptials ; but the paiii she suficred
at the idea of his not being present was real llaj)piness
to what came afterwards. We were called to all earlier
breakfast than usual, the servants desiring this that
they mi~lit spend as much of the day as possible with
their beloved Mistress ; and Sir Clarence was a man
that never refused a reasonable request. It seemed
scarce an hour between morning and evening, so
rapidly did the time fly ~vhich was to rob poor me and
dIl the household of our darling, and cast ~a dark
shadow over our lives which years might lighten but
never could remove. I felt as though soin~ horrible
nightmare had PO~eS~i0fl of me, and how I managed
to give lwr away (which sad privilege devolved upon
me~, and listened in silence to her phighting her vows
to another nmn, I never could tell. Some invisible
power seemed to be holding me up and encouraging

me to go on If) the bitter end. it xva~ all soon over-
it took only a Ibw minutes to separate her life from
mine. She turned to inc l)ale and trembling, and a.~ I
look her in my arms and kissed her, she whispered
I wonder if papa will tell rue goo(l-bye, John ?
Oh, if he only woul(l ! WI10 would kiss inc an(l tell me

Conic with me, and ['II try, anyhow."
II saw that she was flusllc(l with hope, and hoped,
too, that 'Wlicii Sir Clarence saw her he would forgive.
I opened the door softly for her to enter, and saw her
father, with his face buried in his liaiids, leaning upon
the tal)le. lie did not hear us enter, and starte(1 with.
astonishment wheti iNita iai(I lici' hafl(1 upon his bowed
head, aid whispered
"Iior(rive me, papa, and tell your poor child good.
bye. Oh! (lear father, tell me goodi)ye and bless me
before I go."
She looked so fondly and so pleadingly into his eyes
that I had no other thought than thai he would for-
give, and would not banish this gentle child forever
from his home, but was sadly startled when he rose
from his chair, with an expression of countenance that
I never saw Sir Clarence wear before, and said. in a
voice husky with passion
"Go !" ~)0inting. to the door~ "you are no longer a
child of mine! You ~forfeited that claim when von
became the wife of Sir Charles Stuart. Go!" he
repeated, opening the door by which she stood, pam-
ly~ed'~ with fear and disappointment, "and remember

and thinking, too, that he might only make thQ wound

that lonely future which was to be mine, and to that

to ea6h other than we had ever done at any one time in
our lives before. " I think my pony is perfectly
delightful," Eleanor was saying, when we had ridden
about a mile, "and lie doesn't seem to be scary 'in the

when my young horse, who was at times quite unman-

My own horse was standing near, quietly wrazmg on
some fresh green grass which the slimmer rains caused
to spring up all along the side of the hard road. I
soon laid possession of him again awl was hurrying at
an almost frantic rate frying to find poor Eleanor, whom
I feared was killed or very badly hurt, when a little girl,
who I saw through the rails of a cottage fence, told me
Inc flint the young lady's horse had run off in that
direction, pointing 10 the left, over a rich green mea~
dow, where sonic careless TK'rsonS had left the fence
down. I rode as rapidly as my horse could go, fear-
ing All the tune to come up with the poor girl, lest my
'orst apprehen~~ions 5110111(1 be realized. I looked all
over the large meadow but could see no one. At the
opposite side to where It was I noticed a grove of oaks;
to that I directed mx' animal. In a few moments I had
almost reached it, and saw Eleanor's pony at the fur-
ther end of the grove tj~d to one of the trees. This
gave me some hope. I lumped off my horse, tied him
in like manner, and began my M'areli. It was iist lono'
until I caught sight of a man, on a little rustic bench
near 1w, stooping over a form which I knew at once
must be her's. I ran quickly forward, in. my anxiety
and fear; the gentleman turned, as I advanced, and I
saw liv tiic expression ot' his flee that he was very
much troubled. I sprang forward anti looked at Elea-

he found her insensible.
"It am truly thankful to you, sir," I said, address-
ing him, " for your thoughtfulness and kindness in this
unhappy affair. I was thrown myself just .before this
young lady's horse ran oft and was unconscious of the
occurrence when it happened."

in a little stream near the grove. I soon had the hap-
piness of seeing her open her eyes. I leaned over her
and asked "if she felt any pain."
she sa'l(1 ~b but JoIm
"No"                 ,     , wasn't it dreadful?
I was sure that I was going to be killed. Wasn't it
frorrid in your old horse to get frightened? my pony
never moved, and would not have run off if you had
not been thrown. Just think," shuddering, "how near
II was to death. Oh, it frightens me so to think of it!
Oh, it was horrible! horrible! John, don't it frighten
you, too?"

Of course, it does; but you must thank this kind
gei~tleman, here," 1)cckoning him to me, "he has, 1'
think, saved your life, Eleanor."
" Let me thank him, then,'~ she cried, rising. Sbe
thought, as she told me afterwards, that it was some
1)oor Irishman whom I wished her to thank for saving'
her life, and when she saw a (liguified, stylish-looking
stranger, she was so taken l)y surprise that she could
scarcely thank him at all.
"I hope you are not suffering any, my Lady," sai(l
the gentleman, in the polished, courteous manner III
before noticed. "Your rail seemed very severe, and I
feared would be a serious one. I am truly happy that
my fears seem not to be well founded."
".1 ani not suffering at all, and am most truly thank-
ful to you, kind sir," said she, "for your timely assist-
ance. I should like above all things to know the
name of the gentleman to whom III am so indebted."
I-Ic bowed gracefully, and introduced himself as
Lord Gordon. We were no less courteous than he,
and, in a few minutes we were all chatting' a~x
like old acquaintances under the oaks. Eleanor quite
revivc(l, and used all her arts and charms to captivate
the English Lord, for such he told us he was. I
leaned with my head against one of the great trees,
thrown back as far as it could be, for it seemed to be
ready to burst from the effects of my fall, and putting
in a word now and then only to let theni know that I
was thinking of them, but wishing, with all my heai't,
that I was resting on my couch at home. Eleanor~
after all, wa~ not so badly hurt as iuvself~ and now.

"here, papa, thank Lord Gor(lOfl for saving your

kno~v you are gPateful ," she continued, laughing, and
kissing him as he received her into his arms.
"Let me first thank God and His Blessed Mother
tl)at you are safe, my child," said Sir Clarence with
some agitation, "and then I will thank this kind gen-
Ucmaxi and hear how it all happened." Tie paused for
a fbw moments and uncovered his head whilst he made
hit; thanksgiving, and we all involuntarily bowed also
in humble acknowledgment of the great favor vouch-
sa: 'ed us from on high, and of the goodness and patience
of our Heavenly Father to his poor, weak, erring
children. Sir Clarence then gave Lord Gordon his
hand, thanked huu in a niost cordial manner~ and
insisted upon his remaining under his always hospit-
able roof during the night, which I saw the gentleman
was only too pleased to do. The evening passed off
i~'deasantly enough eonsideiing the, danger Eleanor and
I had escaped. Eleanor played and sang several songs
from the most fashionable operas, which had the elThct

its sorrows for all the worl(l ; marriage and

_________ as busy as of yore, mowing down the young
and the old ; but the world went rOufl(I still ; the sun
shone as bright in summer and as dull in winter; the
flowers bloomed as sweetly in~ the spring and the leaves
fell as lightly in he autunin, as if no vows for weal or
woe 1)a(l been irr~\voeahly taken, or no souls launched
into eternity to be forever happy or forever miserable. I
had heard from Nita several times, her letters all breath-
ing the deep, pure love she cherished for her husband-
all telling of his many noble cjualities and of his strong
affection for her. She seemed very happy, loving and
being beloved by him. But every cup of happiness
must have its poison drop, and the one in Nita's was
the continued anger of her father towards her. He
still obstinately refused to become reconciled to his
"erring one," as he chose to call her. He would not
allow her name to be mentioned whe~c he was, and that
loved name seemed to be entirely blotted out from that
old mansion, and perhaps her image from the hearts of
some-for nothing is easier than to forget-but in mine
her ineniory was as fresh as those white roses near me,
which, being just freed from their crystal dew drops,
are looking up to the sun in all their beauty, purity,
and youth.

Elcanor had nianag&amp;l it so that the poor child was
cut off without a farthing. She urged Nita to get mar-
ned, and whilst doino' so pretended take his views of
to
the matte~', and al)~)ca1'ed to Ii im to be very much grieved
at Nita's disobedience, as she called her nlarriao'e. when
speaking to S;r Clarence. I djd not timid this out for
some time, and directly Ii did s~ I went to my cousin
to try to open his eyes to the deception that was prac-
ticed upon him. He silenced inc instantly, asking me
if I thought that I or any other man or woman could
make him think that his child, who had chosen him
before all on earth, cot be capable of it meanness, and,
as I knew, had all her life been respectfull, (lutiful ,and
submissive to him as it was possible for child to be.
It was certainly neither my wish nor intention to
~ prejuc1i~e this~doatLiig father against the daughter if at
he had such unbounded confidence in; and I believed,
too, that Eleanor did love him after a fashion ; but it
was hard foi me to keej) from telling him that it was
avarice,     tj&amp;ttion, which made her apparently so
loving and obedient, and that if ho had been a
man with no fortunes to bestow, he would know his
(laughter, whom he so idolized, to be very,~ very dif-
ferent from what he so fondly imagined. Withmotit
answering, I turned and left the study ~iY+~ilcnec,
resolving that I would never marry and theni I, &amp;o,
would have fortunes to give away, and Nita should be
the one benefited by thi~m. What did it matter if she
and her husband were poor? Was not my wealth to
the last farthing at their service? And so I wrote to
the dear child; but of course did not pain her by tell-

had resolved to do, but only urged her to accept a little
PreSent from ifle aIi(1 in the grateful note which came
in answer, .1 saw that it was most acceptal)le and feared

She sent me about that time a snYLl oil painting of
herself-the shoulders and head-with the long dark
hair, falling gracefully over her neck, looped at one Side
with a tiny pink rosebud, with its three green leaves.
And those large, expressive eyes arc now looking (IOWIL
t~pon me as it hangs over my. little mantel, the only
ornament in the room ,and for which I would not take
in exchange all the ornaments and valuables in this
great WOPI(l. iNo, no ! I love it far better than all
these things, nor ~ould they even tempt me to part
,1~witli it-this little picture, with its ebony and gold
frame, and its sweet eyes that look at mc the last thing
every night and the first in the morning~
So, as I said, the year passed on as other years had
gone. Eleanor and Lord Gordon had met 'frequently.
lie used to make our house his home, at Sir Clarence's
urgent request, every time he came over to Ireland.
Those were happy visits for Eleai~or. They used to
ride, sail, walk, p)ay chess, and sing duetts together.
She was very, very happy. Everything seemed to
favor her, her father being scarce less captivated with
Lord Gordon than herself; and it did not require a
close observance to -see that these two young persons
were mnutuaiiy in love, and that Sir Clarence approved
of it. "Mv Lord Gordon" was considered first in

two swans forming a fountain. II was leaning near this

came up and, seein~~ me; said -
'John, (10 you think to-morrow wilEbe a fine day?
You know there is some IlPish superstition about mar-

see how the mercury stands.
"Now, Eleanor, I would' Eke to call you what you
eallPd me the last time we conversed upon the subject,"
I answered.
Oh, but, John, in a marriage of this kind it is so
necessary for everything to be PrOl)itiOUS. You know
how unph~sant it WOUI(l be if it were otherwise. I am
not jesting, now, and I d~ want you to look at the mner-
cury and tell mc what kind of a day to-morrow will be."

"it is no uselooking at it just now, Eleanor; but,
if it will gratif~r you, I will 5it tip until twelve to-night,
r~n(l report then."
"Oh, then," she said, "ii would be fast asleep, and
it would matter veryjittle if it rose or fell."
"Then I cart do nothing for you except to wake you
up early in the morning and tell you whether the sun
is shining Or~ not, an(l if it iS not, sen(l wo~'d to~ Lord
Gordon to wait until the next fine day."
Oh, hush making fuii of us," she returned ; " it is
110 joking matter."
"No," said I, "if I thought of it as you do, if
to-morrow was a gloomy day, I would certainly send
that word to Lor(I Gordon."
"Come," sai(l Eleanor, suddenly changing the con-
versation, "come and help me tell that stupid Jackson
how to arrange the flowers and vases. You know 11
can never do any thing unless ii have so~ne one near
me to advance ~an idea."
"Oh! Eleanor, I am so sorry that Von found me
here. I was in hopes that my (lay '~ wor was over,
for you certainly have kept m~ busy, and von know
'all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.'"
"You ought to lia~ played all the time, then, if it
would have brightened you up any," she returned,
laughing.
"Oh!" I answered, "as you are trying to rob the
sun of its brightness to-morrow, I am not surprised at
you trying' to stea away mine.~
The next morning everything was as clear and bright
as Eleanor, or any other very superstitious person,
could have wished. She was 'to be married in. chm~reh

one small cloud in the east, seareelv largci' than the
palni of mv hand, that was not \'isihle when fIrst I
awoke. I was standing by oife of the large opeim win-
d~w~-~as the marriage ceremony commenced, and w~s
startled and stil'prise(l at the (bilailVC that Lid takvii

hon an(1 was as l)laek as night ; near the outer e(l(re it
seemed tinged with blood, and it had almost PCaChl(d
the san that was nearly over the church. I felt a
shudder creep over me, but still hoped that it would
hot shadow the sun's brilliance, but just as the two
were pronounced man and wife, it ~caine directly over
~that great luminary and caused a gloom and darkness
almost like an eclipse. I saw Eleanor start, shudder
and grow deadly pale, but the company clustered so
closely around her to congratulate her; thKat she h4d
not time to think about it. Shortly after arriving at
home she met mc in the hall in her traveling dress,
with the frightened look still upon her pale face.
" Oh! John," she sai(I, "did you see it?"
"What, Eleanor?" I asked, looking perfectly uncon~

I;,

SCIOUS, and trying to make her believe that I had not
noticed anything.
"Oh, the cloud ! the cloud ~i' she cried. "I am per~
feebly miserable. II am sure it was ominous, and, oh!
wasn't it dark. I am ~o nervous that I can hardly
walk."
And it was so. The poor thing was almost fright-
ene(l to death, an(l cOUl(1 she have seen it as I did, with
its tinge of blood, I am afraid she would have lost her
Senses with terror. 11cr father called her to him to
say a few parting words alone, and as I saw him put
his arms around her affectionately, .s'o ~fl'cciiomate1y, I
thought of the other child who, a short time ago, had
been repulsed and so cruelly turned out of that very
room, without one kind look or word to help her to
say good-bye to the home she so dearly loved. El~a-
nor came out smiling, with a happy face; Nita had
come pale and trembling, with great, bitter tears fall-
I ng from those dear eyes that would never look on the
old familiar spot again. Eleanor went away in a
sup~rl) carriage, drawn by four magnificent greys, with
servants in rich livery, and all bidding her good-bye
in a happy, cheerful manner, with everything propi-
tious to her happiness. The other poor child walked
by the pale moonlight on the arm of her husband, with
me, their only companion, to see them off and to wish
them well, even the servants being prohibited from.
sayIng good-bye to their beloved mistress. She went
away in the quiet night, not to scenes of gaiety and
splendor, but to a quiet home in Scotland, where she
would help her husband earn his daily bread with her
own delicate hands.

I did so he would order mc "never to corhe back

that I was necessary to Sir Clarence, who was fast
growing old and infirm, and knew that if he ordered
nie never to return to his house my pride would iiot
allow me to do so, and I ~had written so to Nita. I

One evening, four ycar~ after her marriage, I was
sitting on the old veranda; it was the anniversary of
her marriage iiiglit. I bad thought more of her that
cvenillg than F had for over a year. It seemed
as it' even the drops of water froi~n the *jets in the foun-
tains were whispering her name in the music they made,
~is they gently fell into the basins ; and the flowers, as
they bent their pretty heads of various colors towards
each other , seefrued talking in low tones of her who had
so tenderly reare(l them in years gone by. A strange
feeling of anxious sadness came ~ver inc as I thought
a gain of the words in her letter-" If anything should
happen my husband I woiidd die." When I went to
my room, I gazed long at her little picture. It almost
seemed to take life and look at me, and smile in the
old, old way. I wondered if she had changed, and fell
asleep wondering if those dear eyes looked the same
and if her sweet voice had lost any of its music. I
cannot say how long I had slept when I started up
wide awake from a horrid dream, which left me in a
cold perspiration. I was not a believer in dreams, but
tlii~ OflC seemed 1)roj)lletie. I thOU~l1t I had gone to
see iNita in Scotland, but nowhere could I find her. I
looked round the little cottage they told me was her's
but she could not be found. I saw a large greeu mea-
dew, full of tall waving gTass, in Whi('h I wandered.
While there, I noticed an old man, with long white
heard and hair, holding a. scythe in Iui~ hand with
which he was rapidly inowu~g. I drew near to him
9

and sa~v that iU his reaping lie was mowing down a
beautiful white lily. I sprang forward to save it, and
received the form of Nitti, COl(l atid lifdess, in iuiy
arms. I could- only look at time old i'eapei', who
answered my inquiring look by saying : " Soii, the
Lowers must thu as well as the grass." I woke at this
and a deadly terror s~iz~d 11W. 1 SjWaIIg from iiiy bed
and looked at my watch on the 'maittel, and ibLmnd it
Was two o'clock. iNot beino' able to shake oft' time feel-
ing of dread that weighed upou me, I dressed and went
out on the balcony to refresh myself with the night air.
I lit a cigar and sat (iowa. The moon was consider-
ably on the wane, and the stars looked to my troubled
gaze as if they did no~ ~aut to give thisworld of ours
any of their brightness. I sat and thought of the cold,
dead form that had fallen into my arms in my sleep,
and shuddering at the remembrance of that frightful
dreamn-the repeater in my room had reached half-past
three o'clock-when I heard in the still morning th~
sounds of a horse galloping, rapidly over the country
road; it neared the Lodge gate and then ceased. In
a moment, a loud, strong haloo was borne upon the
morning breeze. I saw by the light in the porter's
window, which was instantly OpCflC(l, that lie was
arousecI,~~ and his white head soon peeped through the
door, followed by the necessary question, "Who comes
there?"
"The bearer of a despatch for Mr. John Meredith
to be given quickly as poSsil)le."
My heart gave a sudden bound and seemed as if
bursting from my breast. Who but Nita would send

me a despateli? True, t had business mattOr3 of impor~
tance in England, but would the trustees be mad
enough to s'nd a despatch to 1110 in the night to

was unal)lC to (10 50. 1 was soon standing beneath it
ri~ading the following:
Dear Sir,-I am truly sorry to have to send such painful news,
but such is life, ever full of sorrow. The 'beloved and highly
respected Sir Charles Steuart was drowned yesterday morning at
3 o'clock, whilst crossing Loch Lomond, and it is with the deepest*
~aiu that I make known to you the almost impossibility o~ his
beautiful youug wife surviving this dreadful calamity. The sud-

With respect, your obedient servant,
SIR THOMAS MARSTON.
It was only necessary to read this fearful news once
to take in all its terror. Those few words, "the almost
impossibility of bis beautiful young wife surviving this
dreadful calamity," seemed stamped in indelible letters
llj)0ll my heart. Tile olJ porter, who had been watch-
itig me all the time, suddenly grasped my hand,

woul(l have been i impossible for rue to have kept still.
Ihit time, no matter how slowly it seems to pass, flies at
last, aii(l sooner than I had llOj)C(l I found myself'
a1)prOachiflg the residence of' my poor suffering Nita.
A young If iglllan(l lassie opened the (loor for rue, and
when I 1)ronollneed my name, led me to a little parlor,
with l)retty white curtains and neat furniture. The
flowers in the vases, which had been carefully arranged
by the hand that I knew so well, were withered and
fiided for want of the tender care they were accustomed
to. I (li(l not notice these things at the time, for I
could think of but one thing then, and that was my
l)O0~ Nita, suffering and bereaved, but before I left the
I iouse I scanned carefully-oh, how carefully !-every-
thing that had been cherished or tended by her. I was
but a few minutes in the room when the door opened
and a venerable gcntlemaii entered, who introduced
hi 'uself as the person who had sent me the dispatch.
"Sir," lie said, in answer to the hurried question
asi~ed him about my cousin, "she is, we fear, very low.
The doctor will be here in a few inonients to acquaint
von with all the l)articulars."
As the tears fell from my eyes, this good man seemed
touched.
"Dear sir," he continued, "this is indeed a severe
trial that God has seemed pleased to afflict you with.
We all loved your cousin here as if she were our own.
her husband was my sister's only child, and we were
as devoted to his beautiful wifb as we were to Ii m~n.
here his VOiCC trembled so much that he ceased to

"Michael," I said, when T at last recovered my
voice, "have my horse saddled immediately, and my
valise packed-only a change; I can't wait for more-
and let me be g~me."
"That is right, young master," he said, and turned
to obe~*. a hurried lines to Sir ClarenQe, and left
I wrote few
the dispatch for him to read. I would not allow him
to be called for fear it might delay me, and then, per-
haps, I might never see my darling alive. I walked
down to the lodge ; just as m~r horse came up I mounted
him and rode off. I was not long in wearing out my
1~oor steed from the. rapid pace at which I rode, and
before I got to the relay where I could change the poor
animal, lie w~s almost f~iintin g from exhaustion. Early
tue next morning I was in the sailing vessel which was
to take me over to Scotland. The motion of the boat
was too slow for me, and it felt as if I could walk faster,
so great was my anxiety to reach my destination. I

Tb~k. Then I felt how selfish it was in me to think
only of my grief when this noble man was so bravely
battling against his emotion. I begged him to, forgive
me for thinking too much of myself, and thanked him
fir the example of resignation he had set me.
lie laid his hand gently on my head as I finished,
and said in a kind, tender voice:
"Au, my son, you arc younger by many years than
J am, and life's battles seem more difficult to fight in
our youth than in mature years, when we think more
of the world to come than of this."
Here the doctor entered, and as I went up to him to
ascertain 'his opinion, I saw from the grave expression
of his face that he had but little hope for my cousin.
"Sir," he said-in answer to my inquiry, is there no
hope ?-" in cases of this kind it is better to give expli-
cit answers to relations wishing to know the truth, and
J am pained to tell you that there is none. Your
young cousin has n~t many hours for this world."
I shuddered with excessive grief as I walked after
the physician, who led the way to Nita's room.
She opened her eyes as I entered and gave a low cry
of glad recognition. She raised herself, and in an
instant was in my arms. Yes, there at last, after all
those years,. with no husband between us now. Oh,
merciful heaven, for her recovery-to keej) her always.
But no, God ordained otherwise.
"John, 5ohn,'~ she sobbed, "you have come only to
see my tronbic and sorrow. how differently I expected
to meet you ! And you did not expect to see me this
way wheu you ~aw me again, did you, John?"

~r.

OR, T~ETR1BUTI0X.

"Hush, Nita dear. Don't excite yourself. Try to
get better, try to, for the sake of the many who ai'e
waiting in breathless anxiety to see you well again."
"That they will never see, John-never--never.
My heart and my hopes. are in my husband's grave)
and my body will soon lie by him."
She turned her l)alC, careworn face from me to the
wall as she said this, and the tears chased each other in
rapid succession down those thin, white cheeks, which,
four years ago, had put the very roses to the blush.
The doctor whispered "to say no more she must be
quiet." So when she turned to speak again, I l)eggc~i
her to be quiet and rest.
"It is no use, my dear John, to be so careful of me,
for I feel that God will soon give my poor heart a long,
long rest. Not many suns will rise for me."
"Oh, Nita," I j)leaded, "for the Ewe of heaven do
not speak that way. Oh, my dearest, you do not know
the wound yoU are inflicting upon me."
I must have looked my agony, and I think a ray of
the real truth dawned upon her then for the first time.
I was unable to control this feeling, my grief was so
completely mastering me, and my love, which I would
have hidden, shown through it and frightened me when
I saw that she perceived it. i!Jer pale face grew paler.
"Poor John," she said, "poor, poor cousin ! May
God bless you ever and ever, nw only friend. What
would I have done through all these many years if it
had not been for you, my brave, noble friend ~?"
"Do, dear NiLi, II beg, say no more."
"I want to speak," she answered, "of a matter of

much importance, and one which lies very near my
heart. It is of my loor little baby, so young to lose
his mother."
"Yes, Nita," I interrupted her with, "think of that
and live."
She answered with a weary smile, and continued
"John, will1 you lake my I)OOV little orphan and be
a father to him.. For God's pu~~ love, cherish the lit-
tle creature. For I he sake of hi~ mother, who shared
with you all her childish griefs and joys, oh, love my
little 0flC~ my poor little one."
her eyelids quixyred and the pale lips writhed with
l)ain. Iii leaned over her and said
"Nita, Ii l~erq pi'oimsc in the presence of God to he
a fitther to y.ou&amp;chihl, to stand by hint in adversity aid
pi'osperity, to do all that is within me to keep off I ~'ie
rude storms of life from his devoted head, to think 11 :st
of his soul and body in everything, ai~d my first prayer
in the morning and my last at night shall be to call
down blessings upon him."
Then," ~he said, turning and opening her eyes, in
which a peculiar light was shining, " I (lie happy, and
may God listen, to the prayer of a dying servant and
bless you, my kindest and best friend, forever moit."
She lay back with a quiet smile, and I hoped and
praye~l in my inmost soul that she would i3eturn from
the dark region of death she had almost reached and
live. Towards eve she slept again, but when I lifted
her dear, head to give the prescribed medicine, she
murmured, "No more trouble." I never left her after
that. liter night was restless a~ul an uneasy due. The

Highland girl that first met me, and a Sister of Char-
ity, with Sir James, sat up with me. She asked for
nothing during that anxious time; though she would
often during the night clasp her hands together and
repeat her prayers over and over~again, and would smile
when the Sister, who spent her night on her knees by
the bedside, would recite some consoling aspiration.
Once she turned, as I smoothed her pillow, and held
out her hand, which I took and never relinquished
until the angel df death snatched her away front me.
She asked for her baby about an hour afterwards. It
was brought to her immediately. I held it with one
hand, whilst I held her's with the other. She ki~sed
again and again, in passionate tenderness, the little
bright face, and I never saw such a look of ine~pressi-
ble relief and content as when she saw that the little
creature took a fancy to me at once, and laid his little
face to mine with thie~winning ways of his mother.
"It will (10," she said. "You will love each other."
hen the baby was taken away, I noticed such a
change, that I called, to the little girl to tell the doctor
to come instantly. I was almost beside Thyself with
sorrow. I had hoped until this moment that she would
live-~until the moment when the doctor entered the
room.
." If you have any questions to ask," he said, "now
is the time."
I leaned over and said:
"Nita, dearest, haVe you any message to send to your
father or to Eleanor."
"Oh, yes. Tell dear papa that I died blessing him,

tam so much that was lOVe(i and dear, I returned to niy
home in Erin. II cannot forget how I met fL~ 01(1 ma~
With bowed hea(l, whose hairs, age and 'trouble had left.
in their wjnter of life so few and so white, were seemingly
uncared for, and fell neglected U~0fl his sorrow~stricken
brow. A sadder picture of woe II had never seen, and
br the first time Ii felt there was one who was suffer-
mo' more than me, caused by that greatest of all griefs,
rcmoi'se. He dropped into my arms as I came up to
him. Poor, poor Sir Clarence! My heart bled foi'
the father, and then, for the first time, I forgave him
for the pain he had 'given his younger child.
"You saw her last! you saw her last'!" was all he
could say, and trembled and sobbed as only an old man
can, whose heart is torn by grief, and who knows that
time is no more for him in which to rectify his great
mistake.
I tried to soothe him as best I could, giving him her
Ia4 message over and over again as he required, inter-
rupting inc every flow and then with heart-broken
inquiries, an(1 calling upon hi lost one to come back
once more to her old father.

"Oh, my child ! my child ! " he wouh I say, "your

mc, and he twined himself around my heart with a
chain whose links could never be broken. lie pos-.
sesseci all the sweet, artless ways of his mother, and
kept me continually reminded of sonic clear trait '
hers.
He loved to be with me, and clung to me in sick-.
iicss and in health. lie would appeal to me in his lit-
tie troubles, and in pain, his little eyes, which were so
much like those I had closed, and that were ~iOW SlCej)-.
ing, would look at me to soothe him, as if I had the
cure in my own hands. lie was the most jerfcc~
image of baby loveliness an(l sweetness at night, when
his little arms would be wound round my neck, whilst
lie murmured, in half-brokcii accents, "God bless mc,
and make mc a dood boy," that I ever saw. Then I
would lift my ~vhole soul to heaVen, imploring the
Divine blessing on this lonely infant head, and beseech-
ing the "Father of the fatl~erless"to be tender and
merciful to this pooi' little orphan.
To Sir Clarence, *too, this little creature was the
greatest comfort. Just learning to talk and walk,
and with a thousand j)retty ways of doing everything
~nd saying everything, each day ho l)ecame nearer and
clearer, and every day 1)righter and smarter. When
he had been with us al)out three years, there came a
great change in poor Sir Clarence. lie had never
recovered from the dreadful sliock the death of' the

loved one gave him, and winch caused hirii tx go to an
earlier grave than j)erhaps lie otherwise woul(l have
done.
One evening, whilst I was sitting by him in the lit-.
t~e study, trying to divert him by reading from an
iuterestilvr book I lIOticC(l his cyclitb droop, for I was
very watchful of him u those ways. "Sir Clarence,
are you feeling badly ?" I asked, a~ I cauo'ht his hall(l,
which felt hot and feverish.
Yes, my child, I am tired and weary, and wish I
('Olild rest."
Then," I said, " I will help you to your couch,
where you can rest whilst I fan you, and l)el'llaP.s you
may fall asleep."
" Thank you, ur; son, maybe I would feel better;
just help me therc,~ tell me what my poor, 1~sL
baby told you when she was dying."
I saw his mind7Was wandering' an(l bcckonc~1 to one
of the servants I saw in the yard to come to me. I
sent immediately for the physician, whLst I bathed his
forehead and hands in a cooling, healing liquid.
He was i'cstless and uneasy, and would tioze away
now and then, only to start up to ask something about
his children. "Was that Nita's voice I heard sing-.
ing? has Eleanor come yet? Where are they?
don't let them stay out late, John ; little Nita has a
cough and these night dews may make it worse." I
knew, front main' sentences he uttere(l in his delirium,
that he had been thinking a great deal of the few
events of our childhood, which I have mcntione~l, and
of' Nita's going away. Again ho turned to me and

said : "Did Sir Charles Stuart take my child from
me ? and did she go ~f her own free' will? Yes, she
went from out that door, and I told her she should
never come back again. Eleanor showed great temper
in killing the gUumea-~)ig, utll(l l)OO~ Lttle baby Nita
bore it ~vith such amiability. She is sweeter tempered
after all." ironi other remarks or his, I think he
must have been thinking of all the acts oC their lives,
trvino' t6 draw a comparison between ~them, which was
0
always favorable to Nita. Once he said, whilst I
leaned over him bathing his forehead "John is a
good boy, noble, generous and kind.-hcarted. I can't
think he influenced Nita to go with that Scotchman.
Oh ! if she had only married John I would, so gladly
have given my consent, for lie is everything I could
wish." II heard this last sentence with beating heart
and throbbing brain. Then he had wished for that
union which would have made me supremely happy-
but God saw things differently from man, and II is holy

When the ~)1mysician arrived and had examined his
patient, he told me plainly that Sir Clarence's nerves
had been so shocked by the blow h~ had received front
his child's death that they could, never recover, and
that it would only take time to complete the work-
and theii I knew I must see one more soul that I very
tenderly loved take its flight, see one more gray&amp; pre~
pared for a dear one, before thc same tribute would be
paid to me.
"Sir," said the doctor, "Ii think you had better send
immediately for his daughter, cor I can promise him
but a few days more to live."

I (lid as lie directed, and then sat (lowil by the bed-
,~ide of this good old man, who l]a(1 lived a noble, usc~
fhl life, who had a multitude of friends, and enemies
nowhere to bC found, and who was fast sinking an
unresisting ~'~'y to the cruel reaper death, an(I destined
so soon to leave us forever. Little Paul put his head
of 1)rown curls into the room, and asked in a childish
whisper, "Mayn't Ii ~'onie to see roy grandpapa? " I
took him in my arms and held him up to look at his
01(1 relative. The little creature must have noticed the
great change in him, for he leane(l over and touched
the aged cheeks with his young lips, ~fl(l said "Poor,
dear grandpapa is sick !" My cousin opene(1 his eyes
and recognized his little grandson.
"My dear little baby! so you have come to ~ee youv
grandfather before lie goes?" an(l he drew his curly
head to him, and, kissed the fresh, rosy lips for the
last time. He then 1)lessed him and I took him away.
Eleanor came the next day, Sir Clarence, in the
meantime, so weak that no one was allowed to enter
th2 room but old Patrick, the doctor and myself. That
nio~ht as I Was supporting his head, he said tome:
"John, you have been of the greatest comfort to me,
my son, and God will bless you. Of course, mv child,
as his mother, I also leave von unlimited control of'
little Paul; but JoIm, I would wish that the two little
boys, Gerald and Paul, be brought up together, for I
wish them to both know and i&amp;ve each other, and form
a warm, tender attachment. I will speak to Eleanor,
when she comes, upon this matter, and I wish that my
(lying request should be attended to."

III woul(l have desired this otherwise fbr many rea~
sons; first, that i[ did not want Paul to be brought up
under Eleanor's roof; and, again, II would rather not
bye with her mvselg ~hieh, ifl this (~aSC, 1 should be
compelled to do. Then, again, there were advan-
t'io'cs to be derived from this arran~inent which I
couki not help but see. Paul would need a lady with
him, as all boyS growing up do. if raised with only
nIl old bachelor, like myself, lie would, J feared, lack
the cultivation and refinement which only young men
raised by lady-like mothers or with educated, refined
ladies, can acquire, and l~leanor was the only female
relative that either of us had that we knew anything
about. After her arrival the whole matter was settled.
We ~~'ere to live with her until the children were
grown, then the old house in Ireland was to fall to lit-
tIe Paul's share of Sir Clarence's fortune, which was
equally divided bet~veen his grandsons.
I think Eleanor was really grieved~ for the first time
shice I knew her, when she sa~v her father's approach-
ing death. I tried to arrange everything exactly as he
wishe(1 Concerning the children, though I[ saw Paul's
aunt was not please with the beauty, hc~dtlm and attrac-
tive ways of the little orphan, when her owni well-
attended boy was pale, sickly and irritable. They
were kept~ far away from the sick roOm, and every-
thing in the house sc~med as still and quiet as if it
were no longer inhabited.
Two days after Eleanor came we sa~v the death
struggle approaching. I held both of his hands in
mine, feeling the pulses grow weaker and weaker.

Eleanor leaned, with her face hurie(l in her hands, near
the 1)ed while the old servants stood around with their
sorrowful eyes looking, for the last time, on their o4d
master, who had been a kind, lenient and generous one
to them. The doctor was there, too, but his skill was
of avail no longer ; there was a stronger hand than his
at work, and one that had never failed, combat it as
you would. I called softly 'to Eleanor, as I saw thai
was rapidly ebbing a~vay. She came and stood by
him, 1)tlt it was my name he called, and I leaned over
an(l heard these, last words, "May God and His an~'els

that noble heart ceased locating, and the world had lust

It was a sa(l house that we were to leave l)eJ'hiaPs
forever, and go over to England. I walked arohild
each loved sceneand seemed to love them more and
nore, as I felt I must leave them for many, many
years. Everything was as it used to be when Nita
anti I played together among the fountains, which
were still play~uig, though we rambled there no more.
11cr Nile lilies in the conservatory I went to look
at; even they seemed sad, with their heads drooping
lovely to the ground. Near the beautiful waters of the
Shannon, where I had once heard her sweet, plaintive
voice in the evening hymn, I lingered, and thought of
how many weary hours I had passed since then, how
many a sigh of grief and sorrow had escaped my lips,
how many fresh wounds were made~iu my heart which
would never more be healed, and how many more
would be there before that lQvCd spot would meet fl~

"That's strange," we both said, musing.

Pie losses a fund of imagination from which they gen7

"That's true," was the quiet answer of' the Duke's,
and we dropped this subject which had been renewed
for the second time.
The next day the old mafi left us. lie had given
us much pleasure by his ~ and with many
regrets we badcliim adieu. And now to return again
to Eleanor and to the boys. The old Eleanor Graham
was returning day by clay ; the cold, unkind manner,
the haughty, imperious temper, the harsh and severe
tones-and Ii felt more for little Paul in those days
than I did even in years after, for she tyrannized over
him when I was not by, and the little life that should
have been all sunshine was inadc sad and unhappy.
I noticed one night, when the children were in bed,
and their brown and fair curls pilloweci on their
do~vny cushions, that Eleanor came to tell her son goo~I
night, which she always did, and pas~cd by the couch
of Paul without noticing him. I had often, in nights
before~ when I ~went~ to bid him good-night, noticed
the tear drops on his glowing cheek, ajid I ventured
to ask:
"What is the matter, my boy?"
"Why is it, uncle," he asked, "that aunt Eleanor
never biils me good-night? I am sure I would be
very happy if she would. You always kiss Gerald
good-night, and why can't she kiss me?"
" Nevcr mind~ my davhin~," I said ; "she does not

intend to be unkind, it is only forgetfulness." So,
when I saw the silken lashes resting upon each cheek,
and heard the drowsy voice say ." good-i~ight," I stole
softly to Eleanor's chamber. She was sitting near the
open window, and I seated myself in the vacant chair
beside her.
"Eleanor," I l)egan, "why is it that you cannot be
more affectionate in your manner to poor little Paul?
Ii am sure you could at least give him a good-night
kiss, and the little creature's heart would be so much
lightened by it; he, child as he is, notices how very
different your manner is to him than to Gerald."
"And, indeed, sir," she said, with fire flashing in her
eyes, "I want everybody to notice the difference. iDo
you think," she continued, "that I, too, am going
crazy over that chill, who is already as full of conceit
as if he were a man of twenty-fix~e'? I think, for my
part, that you are crazed on this subject. You are
making yourself ridiculous about him. Yes, I do
kant everybody to see that my child is preferred to
him, ai~~1 everybody to know it."
But, Eleanor," I said, "just for once put by preju..
dice, and look with a j ~st eye upon the matter. Mould
it either injure you or your child to be kind and just
to a little orphan-one whose mother was your sister-
and is it right in you to nourish the idea of this false
pride and vanity in your son that he is superior to
Paul and to other children? No, Eleanor Gordon;
the day may yet come when you will wish that you
had listened to advice, and treated with more care and
tenderness 'the little boy whose mother is sleeping
under the sod,?'

what I would have, done, young Masther-he knocked
Gerald down, and the spoilt youngsther howled at such
a rate that his mother came running~-to know what was

"Are you sure, I asked, "that Paul was not in the
wrong?"
"No, indeed ! " he answered; "I am only sorry that
he didn't hurt that little Vandal when lie knocked
him down."
"Don't say that, Patrick," I said, "for you are ~L5

Gerald's."

me that his young life hung upon a thread. IL felt a
suffocating feeling rise in my throat. What could I
do without this young child, that had his mother's face,

her nobleness of dispositioli. Ille was afl on earth I

Old Patrick, too, appeared- never to weary at the sick
couch, seeming to rival inc in his attent~ouS. And,
indeed, it was true that this little sick boy held the~-
chord-s of his heart as well as mine. Th~ physician
wa~ a kind, good man, who 5~eined most anxiouS about

I gave him my hand, for my hearty was too full for
inc to speak, and in that grasp we vowed eternal friend-

until at last lie was convalescent.

thus gazing and pointing from one lovely scene to

was all so ~ieat~y laid off in pretty ilowex.beds that you

So we walked a few yards further 'down to a neigh-

tinned to look upon the little cottage. In one of its
windows hung a cage with a little canary, which was
warbling away it's sweetest music and seeming to enjoy
above all things the soft spring sunshine. A little girl
came to the window and. threw in a handful of seed to
the bird, wIle picked them up in his bill, apparently
with the greatest relish. Then the little girl caine forth

The boys said no more, and I thought, as I had often
thought before, had Gerald lbeeni away from his mother's
influence and example, he would have been a different
being.
Very often after that we saw little Amy Waylandl,
wvho sometimes came to the Lodlge with an old nurse to
brn  Paul flowers that grew oa her favorite bushes.
'The children played together, and seemed to enjoy
amainlyhaving a itlegrl with them.. I used to
sit on the piazza (for I always loved children) and
watch the three in the vardl at play, wondering if -in
after years these three little life paths would converge
or diverge. Noticing all the while the three characte es
that must one day be formed either for good or for en l,
I could not help seeing how manly and gentle little Paul
was to the young girl he ,christened Fary She
would eling to him for protection, while she and Geral
were always at openi warfare-I must say that Geral
was always the .attacking party-whlile Paul would
coax until he would get them ihto a good humor with-
out using any violente on either side.
Although there were but three nionths difference in
these boys ages, still there were years in other respects,
and Paul seemed to have the advantage.
Eleanor even noticed the exceeding beauty of Amy,
and tol me " she thought it would be dangerous for
the boys if she continued to grow as pretty, for all boys
go crazy over a pretty face, antd. either of .1em may
forfeit his position mR order to marry her."
I laughed, for what she said seemed ridiculous, and
answered, "that if Paul. (chose to fall mn love with her

when he was grow i lie could do so with my full per--
mission andl conseit."
" Andi you don't know even who she is ?" said
Eleanor, with some warmth.
"I know," I answered,"that she is a very sweet
(childl, and I am sure her mother is a lady."
" That is not sufficient for me," she exclaimed, turn-
ing away, "and when she grows larger she must be
kept awvay from my house altogether."
I smiled to myself as she made this remark, as I
thought it very silly ; for I did not know how it would
all be in years to come.
One evening I missed the three children from the
yard, where they had been playing. I had been read-
ng, and was so deeply interested in nmy book that when
Ifinished I missed them for the first time, and could
fidtem nowhere. It was very heedless in their
attendants not to have been with them, but Eleanor
and Lord .Gordon were in London, and in their absence
the servants at the Lndge seemed to desire a holiday,
and I could hardly blame them, for they had a right
hard time of it other days. I went to look for the two
boys who usually attended Paul and Gerald, but one
of them, I was told, was bird hunting, and the other
had gone some distance in the country to see his grand-
mother. I was very muchi provoked when I heard
this piece of news, and continued myself the search for
the missing ones. I walked thi-ough the great avenue
of trees, through the park, where deer were feeding
leisurely here and there, but I could not fiud them. 1

of Dr. Arnold. II had sent home for the pOliyClUUsO
to take the little girl home, and ~vhen' it arrived she
was ready to go with me. She sat in my lap as I drove
the pony along through the beautiful country, telling
mc all the cireumStalices of the adventure., They had
all gone to the stna'll~ island to get ~omC Ilowers that
grew u p0i~ it, and "I being too near the edge, fell in,
and. if it hadn't been for Paul, ~vould have been

v~ hich I never saw there before. "I am sure my niamifla

be very angry if he hears that I had gone there."
II promised that I, would not, and we soon reached
the cottage, nestling among th&amp; trees, looking so cool
and pleasant. The door was opened to us by the old
woman who used. to bring Amy to the Lodge.
"Is my papa at home, Kellie?" enquired the child.
"No, d~ary," she replied, and she took the child in
her arms, a~ if she understood why. th&amp; question was
i~sked.
II asked to see Mrs. Waylaid, for I thought it was
only right that she should be made acquainted with the
adventure. I was taken into a little parlor, and was
at once struck with the refined look of everything.

JOhN DISCOVEnS SOME IWLATJONS.
~Th ~ TIE small town of L- lay some ten
to the ~vest of Gordon Lodge. It
miles
was well built, J)leasantly situated, and
heahhfully located, with many hand-
somely-built dwellings and wealthy factories. I had
for convenience concentrated all of my business here,
and one evening, weary and tired, as I was returning
from this town, after a day of many business transac~
t ions that were both tedious and disagreeable, Ii was
riding along the edge of the moorland on horseback,
for I was still fond of this mode of traveling. As I
approached the grove of dark firs Ii saw a man leaning
against one of them in a hunting-jacket, with his arm
resting carelessly on his gun.- He was a slight, hand-
some man, and his attitude was fearless and manly. I
could not tell what it was that made me shudder, but
think it must have been the man's position. He seemed
to be of a most companionable disposition, for as I
advanced towards him he mounted his horse and joined
inc with a bow graceful enough for a cavalier in the
time of chivalry. We were soon chatting very pleas~
antly together, and I would have thought him on the
a very estimable companion but fqr a restless,
unquiet look in the eye which I did not like to encoun-
ter. In the course of, our conversation he told me his

vei' beautiful country seat about three Ines from the

giving the most fashionable dinners, and furnishing the
best of wines most lavishly, which made him very
popular amongst thc young men, while mammas with
marriageable daughters looked at the handsome hail
and then, at the handsome man, and between the two
he was, completely lionized.
Our conversatioJ~ naturally turned on the people of
the country as we passed some of their country seats,
and lie told me there were a great many families com~
ing down that seasoll who were in the habit of going to
German watering places.
Just here we came upon little Amy WayThnd and
her old nurse, who were taking an evening promenade.
I stooped down and shook the small hands that were
held up to me, whilst Godfrey Laughton ran his hands
through her silken curls, saying:
"how is my little girl this evening 9
"I'm well ," was the short and, It thought', cufrt

III could not help noticing tl4s, thinking it was rather
strange, and wondering ~~hat was the dislike the child

could have for him. After we had left and ridden
some distance he turned to me and said:
"You have seen that child before, I see."
"Oh, yes," I said, "I hav6 s6en her several times."
"She is a very beautiful thing," was his rejoinder,
"and has a very sweet mother."
"Yes, I have seen her, too," was my reply.
"Have you, indeed,'~ he sai(l, significantly, "then I
suppose you have seen her husband also?"
"No; I have never met him. I suppose you have
had that honor, though."
"Oh, yes; we have been friends ever since we met
in her Majesty's service some three years ago. He
was captain of a company in a foot brigade, and I
belonged to the same regiment."
"Then you are an Englishman," I said; "but you
Seem to me to look rather yotipg to have 1)elonged to
a 1!egiment some three years ago."
I thought there was a slight hesitation in his voice
a~ lie answered
"Yes, bout I was always older than my looks, and f
joined the regiment anyhow."
I was but half satisfied when I heard him say this,
and rode on for a few moments without speaking~
Thou to break this silelice, which was embarrassing, I
remarked:
"So you know the Waylands?"
"Oh, yes."
"Are they from this part of the country?" I asked.

neared the cottage I saw little Amy run from the
house, slamming the door behind her. I naturally
hurried on to bid her good morning, and as I opened
the little wicket o'ate was somewhat surprised to see
the chjld crouching beneath one of the rose 1)uslles, cvi~
dently anxious to hide herself. I walked forward, afl(l
what was my surprise to see tear drop 3 oii her rosy
cheeks. I pj~k~d her up in my arms and asked her
what was the matter. She only answered me with a
low 501), as she nestled her head upon my shoulder. I
carried her to the house, still in my arms, and noticed
that she trembled at every step. I. reached the porch
and was just about to lay my hand. upon the (loor, when
it was opened from the inside, and I met, face to face P~r
the fmr~t time, Captain Wayland. A more repulsix e-
looking m~mn could scarcely be imagined; his f~mce was
bloated with dissipation and wore a scowl that was
truly forbidding. The child clutched me tighter the
instant he made his appearance.
"So, my little Miss," he broke the silence, without
noticing me, you ran away from me, did you? but
you shall be paid for all this."
lIe attempted to snatch her from my arms, but I
waved him back.
'~ Who are you?" he said, with an angry frown.
"Who dares interfere h&amp;tween me and my child?"

father's brother, where I was raised on the banks of
the Lee instead of the James. My father was a cam
taiii in the United States Navy, and died in the ser-
vice of that country whilst I was still very young."
I could scarcely eontr6l my impatience to know her
another's~ name until she had finished sl)eakino' and
then I quickly asked
"Mrs. Waylaid, what was your mother's name?"
"Mary ~ she replied, somewhat surprised
at the abrupt manner in which I put the question.
"Had she a sister?" I asked.
"Yes, only one, who was some years younger than
herself. There were only the tx~'o children, who were
unfortunate enough to have lost their mother whilst
both were very youi~g."
"What was l~er name?" I said ,ahnost breathless,

"Mrs. Wayland, do you know that you are my cou~

"What?" she said, with a new light in her eyes,
anti her face becoming perfectly beautiful ; " what!

mother so fondly loved, aiul who I was taught always
to lox~e and P"~Y for?' You her child? then God has

Gerald should not go, so he was rarely one of the

stories, and enjoy seeing them so happy. On one of
these evening visits, Geraldine and I were sitting on
the porch in our accustomed place, watching the chil-

I could scarcely keep from sighing as I looked at them.
for we were j ust as happy Once, our voices jUst as merry.

saw the man I had met un(ler the firs, Godfrey Laugh-

manner; in his path was little Amy, whom he picked
up and kissed on her rosy cheeks. The a6t was nothiiv~0

turned from us, an action which seemed natural with
him, but which prevented us from catching his eye
whilst he was talking.
Geraldine, when he addressed her, mn~rely ans~vered
in monosyllables, and I noticed that she slightly slmud-
dered as lie stepped upon the piazza. After a while he
asked for Captain Wayland.
"I do not know where he is," said Geraldine, a little
nervously; but scarcely had she uttered the words when
he joined us. If e offered me his hand which I took,

her that I did my imtmo~t to remove it, but without

'too, that Amy St. Clair will be a second mother to her,
I feel that duty requires me to let her go. None will
know bow I will miss my darling child," she went on,
but I have had so many heartaches already, that

"Never mind that, Geraldine, I answered; "I prom-
ised to be your friend years ago, an(l I will always keep
my pledge."
She understood the significance of these words and
heki out her hand, whilst gratef~~l tears gathered in her
eyes. I clasped the extended hand warmly, and told~
her that I would come again the next (lay and assist
her in making all the necessary preparations.
As I took my way homeward I could not help feel-
ing very sorry for poor Geraldine, who could not enjoy
in peace the one comfort that God had given her.
When I reached the Lodge, I found Paul sitting under
one of the trees in the yard studying his philosophy. I
went up and took a se~ut by him, and asked him if he
had missed his lesson.
"Oh ! no, sir," he answered, quickly. "I was only
studying this lesson for to-morrow, so that I would
have time this evening' to o'o wi di you to the cottao'e"
"Yes; Paul, I want you to go with me as often as
possible in the next ten (lays, and see as much of Amy
as you can."

years.
I did not know that this announcement would have
had such an efl~ct upon him. lie said no more, l)lIt
his Pace changed color, and diiriiig the rest of the day lie
was silent and gloomy. I walked with him again that
evening to the cottage, and W~15 very much snri)rise(1
upon reaching it to ~ee a carriage and pair drawn up
before the door. We seated ourselves ii pon the piazza,
not wishing to disturb the visitor. I knew it must be
a lady from the soft musical tones that reached my ears
every now and then, and, at one time, I overheard her
say:
Now, little Amy, whew4oti want a friend you
know whom to apply to."
And agamn:
"Don't be fretting yourself' about youi4 mamma, for
am here to take care of hers and whenever she wants
you, you shall come back to her."
Shortly after this I heard the rustling of a silk dress,
and the lady came to the door followed by Geraldine
and Amy. As she stepped on the piazza, Geraldine
introduced me to Lady Grantly. She bowed very
graciously, made two or three pleasant remarks, kissed
Amy most affectionately, and I then assisted her to her
carriage, in. which she was soon driven out of sight,
1(aving a very agreeable impression upon me. She
;as not pretty, but then there was something so s upe~

nor about her that I felt unconsciously attracted
towards her.
Geraldine told me afterwards that sIte was a good
friend of hers, and that would have been enough of
itself to inoTatiate her in my favor. After this we
had a very j)h~1Sant chat, and Geraldine insisted that
we should stay to tea; every evening of the next week
we spent at the cottage. At last the day arrived for
Amy's deparbire. Ii could scarcely repress a tear
myself when I saw her trunk packed and labelled
Paris, feeling how many changes would take place,
during the years to pass, before I could see her pretty
face again. I feared to think of' them, for I knew
they would be many and great. Poor Geraldine, I
never was as sorry for her as I was that morning. It
seemed as if she could not give up her only' child; the
expression of agony in her pale flice was so great that
it was l)ainflll to look upon, and I turned away. At
last she was compelled to bid her mother the final
adieu as time was pressing, and I took her from the
arms of her mother, sobbing as if her little heart would
break, and we left Geraldine alone in the cottage with
an almost broken he~rt.t Amy had kissed Paul too,
who did not attempt to restrain his tears, for his heart
was really touched, and he was very, very lonely after
the little girl left.
Her father was the last person she came to' in bid..
ding us all farewell, and she turned to hint saying:
"Good-bye, papa."
"Good-bye, little Amy," he said, and leaned over

and kissed her, and I though, for the first time, I saW
a soft look in his eyes, which seemed to melt his hard
face. We then })laced her in the carriage and shut the
door, waving our hands and handkerchiefs to her till
she was out of sight. I returned to the cottage, to the
poor, weeping mother, and to Paul, who also needed
comfort.

CHAPTER XVIII.
PAUL AND GERALD'S RETURN.

MAY as well pass over a period of seven
years here, for very little occurred in all that
time that is worth writing about for the enter-
tainment cf any of my readers. It is true
that in that time we had sent our boys to college, and
I need ~not say that we missed them sadly. With
this exception everything went on in its usual routine,
my dailyxisits to Geraldine, my weekly visits to Paul,
and little contentions now and then with Eleanor was
thQ way my life was spent; but now there was coming
a great change, the boys were coming back, boys no
longer, but young men. Paul was a graduate with
the highest honors. Gerald was not so fortunate.
Eleanor attributed this to ill-health, but I attributed
it~ to its real cause, inferiority of mind. I could see
each day that Eleanor was jealous of Paul's progress,
and when she heard with what honor and distinction
he had graduated, she turned away wholly displeased.
It was already Thursday evening in June, and the fol-
lowing day the boys were to be at home. I was so
anxious to see Paul, that all the evening I was restless
and walking about at random. Eleanor caine out and
met me as I came upon the piazza, and joined me in
my promenade.
"I declare, John," she said, "I can scarcely wait
until to-morrow to see Gerald, I am so anxious te see
him. Lord Gordon," she said, addressing her hus~

band, who was smoking a cigar at the upper cnd of
the balcony, and watching his (logs gamboling on the
lawn, "has Gerald improved any, you have seen hunm
since I have ?"
"It won't bie long until you. can see for yourself,
Eleanor, and I would rather you wouldl be- the judge.
Paul is a handsome fellow, John, and he has such a
fine address."
"Yes, Paul has given me great satisfaction, and I
am justly proud of hima, a worthy descendant of the
House of Graham," I said, looking at Eleanor, think-
ing that this would please her, for she was proud c f
her family ; but she turned away her head, seemingly
very much provoked, and said to Lord Gordon:
*"It is strange that you never see anything in yer
own son that is worthy of praise or admiration."
"Indeed, I do, my wife," he said, looking at her
proudly, for she was -still a very beautiful woman;
"Gerald's career so far has pleased me greatly, espe-
cially as he has .always been so weak and delicate."
Here he gave a significant glance at me-.
She seemed to be satisfied after this, and the .rest of
tke evening passed pleasantly enough. We all retired
early anxious for the night to be over that we could
meet the dawning of the coming day, which arrived at
last bright and cheering. I was awakened early by
the chattering of the birds outside on the limbs of the
trees, and by a sunbeam which stole in through an
aperture in the shutter, and fell across- my eyes. I
jumped up hurriedly, remembering the day, and went
down to an early breakfast, for everyone seemed like

myself, anxious to be up arnd doing. We chatted away
.jpleasantly enug duing breakfast;  laorloi
at her watch twenty times during the meal, to see when
the hour would come that would bring her son. " Well,
Eleanor," I asked, "howv many hours now before they
will be here."
"I don't know," sihe saidl, laughing. "I believe
my watch has run down, the hands don't seem to have
changed position since I looked at it last."
" I suppose not," said Lord Gordon, smiling; " for
you havn't given them timef
V/c all three laughed at this, and then adjourned to
the sitting-room whi~h overlooked the carriage road.
I drew a comfortable chair to the window, and looked
out upon the scenery around. Everything seemed to
be lazily sleeping beneath the warm rays'of the June
sun; even the great sea appeared slumbering, so idly
and slowly. it was flowing a long with the sunbeams
kissing its surface. But I was not thinking of all this;-
my thoughts were with the boys that were coming
back, and were now not far from us. I offered an
inward prayer that their manhood would be spent
more agreeably together than their childhood. My
heart was right heavy on that day, when it should
have~ been so light, and as I turned'to the centre table
near which ,Eleanor was sitting leaning oveapic
of fancy work, I sighed heavily, for there was te
same face, the face of Eleanor Graham, beautiful still,
but col and stern and unsoftened by years, or by
trouble either, for in Eleanor's vocabulary this little
word was missing. I turned agai-n 'to the window and

waitedd patiently for the next half hour to elapse, l~ut
I had not waited more than twenty minutes, when I
saw two young horsemen cantering along the moorland
road; my heart beat high, for I kne~v but too well who
these were. As they caine up without breaking their
lope to the Lodge gate, joyfully opened by the old
porter, one of theni leaned his graceful figure for~vard
and shook the 01(1 man's hand cordially, whilst the
other gave a careless nod and came rapidly on~vards,
and was soon in the arms of his mother. I shook
G~rald warmly by both hands, ~elcoining him back to
the Lodge, and then hastened to meet Paul, who
jumped from his horse, and ran forward to meet me.
"My noble boy 1"
"My dear uncle!"
lie was then clasped iii my arms; at length I
pushed him from me to take a survey of his person,
and a nobler form or a manlier face had rarely met
eyeS.
Paul, I am really proud of you."
"I have worked hard to make you so, uncle," ~yhjlst
a slight blush of pleasure suffused his cheek.
"Bless you, n~y boy," It returned, as I led the way
up the steps.
Eleanor gave him her hand, saying, "flow are you
Paul'?"
"Very well, Aunt Eleanor, and am glad to see look-
~o well," he answei'ed, as he shook her hand.
"Oh, yes, I am feeling very well, thank you," and
thi3 was all. But Lord Gordon was much more cor~
dial; he met paul, saying:

"Well, Paul, we are delighted to see you bacic, and
many times welcome to Gordon; you are an honor to
us all, olti fellow, and we are proud of you."
"Oh, thank you," said Paul, his color brightening,
"You honor me too much l)y saying this."
"honor to whom honor is due, you know," replied
Lord Gordon, and we walked to the sitting room,
whcr6 Eleanor and Gerald had preceded us, and took
our seats.
Eleanor was. seated upon the sofa with her arms
around Gerald, whose head rested upon her shoulder'
it was still a fair head, with an abundance of light curls
clustering about the blue-veined forehead; the express~
~ton of the face was rather effeminate, and there was
little about it that denoted character, strength, or vigor.
his hand was as white and delicate as that of his
mother's, which he was holding, calling her all the
while by a dozen pet names, and telling her that all
England would never make him stay so long away from
her again, and saying, laughing:
"I have not felt so much at lionie for the last six
years."
"Nor I' so happy, my son," said his mother; "and
you certainly are not going away from me again; it is
too great a pain to be separated from you."
Anti she looked at liini with the old look of tender-
ness, which her face wore whilst gazing upon her son,
anti which I never saw there at any other time.
And there they sat, he coaxing and scolding by turns,
in a half-boyish way, for not bringing him home before,
and saying that she was "never to let him go away

again, and that there was nobody in tlu~ world like his
pretty mamma',
Thus they carried on their conversation, whilst we
sat some distance apart, speaking of various things,
while Lord Gordon sat at an equal distance between the
tWo, speaking first to his wife and thew to his son. Li
the course of our conversation, Paul asked me about
Amy and when she was coining. I answered by
asking him if lie remembered her.
"Indeed I do," he saki, "just as well as if it had
been yesterday we parted."
"I suppose she will be at home some time this sum-
mer; at least Geraldine w~is hoping this whcn I saw
her last."
He was looking out the window whilst I was speak-
ing, and happening to see his old dog, he exclaimed:
"If there is not my old dog, looking j us~ as well as
ever! I do wonder if he would know me?"
I bade him lean forward and see. H~ did as lie was
bid, saying:
"Come here, old fellow."
The dog, as he recognized the old. familiar tone~,
lifted his head, wagged his tail, and whined with
delight. Again Paul called:
"Come here, Warder."
rfhe dog jumped up, with two or three bounds
reached the piazza, put his great l)a~vs upon the win-
dow-sill and his nose almost in his master's face, and
then leaped about and barked so furiously that he
almost deafened us9 whilst Paul, to quiet him, stroked
and patted him upon the- head. The rest of the time

the faithful animal was content to lie under the window
and watch his master's every movemeuL
"Well, old boy" (this was Paul's usual manner of
addressing him), "you would be a good teacher to many
a fickle one in this world by your constancy and faith-
fulness."
There were so many questions to be asked and
answer~d~ so many anecdotes to be told and so many
servants to be spoken to whQ came to Welcome their
young masters, that we foujul the (lay had almost
passed before we knew it and night coming' on.
Eleanor entertained lwr son after tea with a few songs,
for her voice was still good, and at half after ten, the
boys being tjred, we all arose, bade each other good
night, and sought our separate chambers. This was a
very pleasant beginning, and I trusted it would con-
tinue so unto the end.
The next evening Paul asked me if I would not
walk with him to the cottage to see Geraldine. I
answered "With all my heart," and we took our hats
aii d went forth along the old familiar road which we
h~d trod years before when lie was but a boy. But flow
lv~ walked beside me almost as tall as myself; noble and
graceful, and true to his manhood in every sense of the
word. He was as unaffected as lie was when a boy,
and our conversation was as easy and unrestrained as it
was then. As we neared the cottage everything had a
cheery and brighter, appearance than it had worn for
these many years, when the little girl's silvery laugh
rang out iii the yard and the little footsteps never tired
/ of pattering down the piazza. Though the laugh was

quiet and th~ sound of the footstep II could not hear,
still there were the parlor wii~doxvs open and the inns-
hn curtains, pure an(l whito as the snowdrift, pushed
back upon their brackets, while the canary (a worthy
descendant of the one that hung there so many years
ago) carolled away in ha epy notes a sweet melody.
The whole aspect of the cottage seemed to have under-
gone a change, and my curiosity was excited to know
the reason. As we reached the foot of the 5tC1), Ger~
aldine came out on the piazza to meet us, with her sad
Thee looking brighter and happier than I had seen it
look for many a long day. Closely following her was
- /
a young girl of apparently some eighteen or nineteen
summers, whom It instantly recognized as Amy, clothed
in a pi~ctty, cool summer muslin, with a pink rose nest-
I jug in hei' soft brown curL I do not think I ever
beheld a fairer picture than she represented as she held
out her two small hands to us, exclaiming in the softest
and 1leasai~test accents:
"What a charming me&amp;tincr! How delighted I am
to se3 you!~~
"Of course I knew you, Paul," she said, in answer
to his enquiry if' she would have reeognizecl him if he
had come unaccompanied by mc. "Of ~ course you
have grown and have changed to~ a greYit deal, but
there is something about you \that I would ~have recog-
n~zcKl, though I do not know what it ~
"You know," she went on in a lively strain, "I have
always considered you a hero, and ,you must have im-.
me very forcibly when you rescued my kitten,
and mc too, from a watery grave."

172              (4Oii~DON LODO1~;                                                     0I~, J~ETR1B1TTJ0N.            173

"Oh, yes," he answered, "I rcrndmber all that, and
hope I won't lose all claim to that appellation, but hope
too that you will allow inc to render you m~ny a
service.~~
"Indeed I will, whenever an oj)portunity presents
itself" she said, laughing, "but I hope you do not
want me to fall into the sea again."
"No, not you," lie answered, l)llt I would not mind
your kitten f~dling in, so that I might prove to you that
I ~tm a true knight."
Thus they were chatting away happily and freely,
when my surprise was awakened to its fullest as I saw
Gerald open the cottage gate and enter. He was invi-
ted into the parlor l)y Geraldine and introduced to her
daughter. Scarcely had lie taken his seat than he was
follo~vcd by another visitor, and I thought it a most
disagreeable intrusion when I recognized Godfrey
Laughton. Geraldine and Ii sat apart watching this
group of four, and I saw that Laughton was instantly
sh ~uck with Amy's beauty and the simplicity of her
m mners. I saw too that lie was d~terminecl to win her,
ai~ d was then using all his powers of fascination to
at tract her; aimd Gerald's susceptible heart was easily
made captive; while Paul, who had loved her always,
seemed to have that same faithfulness and constancy~
which he the day before admired so much in his dog4
I thought I noticed a little fear and a shrinking
from Godfrey in Amy, and she seemed to observe, as I
did long before, the restlessness in his eye and the
unquietness in his manner. To Gerald she appeared
somewhat indifferent, to my scrutinizing glance, though
I ~k

to another observed' sho would have appeared altogether
attentive. I did not mark the impressioll that. Paul
had made upon her, though I am very sure it must
have been an agreeable one, for otherwise I would have
noticed it. Ii 'think sh~ tried to conceal as mncli as
possible her feelings and to treat the three gentlemen
with the same degree of cordiality.
The evening was very far advanced wThen we left the
eott'io'e to return home. Godfrey Laughton, whom w~'
had left behind, shortly after joined us, saying:
* "'Ag my home lies in this direction, it will give mc~
great pleasure to accompany you all that far" /
"We will be pleasedd to have 'you," we all said in a
voice, and silence for a few moments enstjed, which was
l)rokcn by Gerald saying:
"I think Amy Wayland is adorable!"
"Ah ! indeed I" returned Laughton. "So your
heart is taken captive already?~~
"Oh! I do not think it is as bad as that," lie said,
laugl~iing; "but she is truly very charming, and I will
acknowledge that it is in danger,~~
"What do you think of her, Mr. Steuai't?" Laugh~
toii asked, patting Paul upon the shoulder. "Are you
as. far gone as Sir Gerald?"
I thought Paul a little offended at the rather light
tones in which they spoke of Amy,. foil I had taught
him all my life to venerate the fair sex, of' whom 'he
had a most exalted ophuion; and though lie had not
loved Amy, I think lie would hate been equally
offended.
~My Opinion of iWi&amp;~ tJ4iy~nd is v~ very high one,"

* he said. "I think her a most cha-rming young lady,
an(l I admire her character even more than I do her
face."
"Oh ! " said Laughton, with quite a sinister sneer,
I think you quite as much, if iiot more. enchanted
than Sir Gerald ! "'
"1)o you?" was the' cool reply, and the subject was
ijot renewed again.
At the p1ac'e of parting, as we were shaking hands
With Godfrey, lie said
"I hope you gentlemen will join my fishing excnr~

TIlE FIShING EXCURSION.
lIE morning of the fishing party soon ar-
rived. Paul seemed still to hesitate about
going, when It asked him after breakfast,
but I insisted upon it, for he was still a
hard student, and 1 was anxious for him to take as
much recreation as possible. ~He allowed himself
but little, a walk to the ~cottage in the evening and an
occasional hunt with his old (log being all, as lie w: ES
just as fond of bringing d6wn a bird as aiiybocly, a~.d
the old dog seemed just as ~iehighited at seeing his
master with his gum as he was long ago when lie was
young and full of life and strength.
"You seem determined that I shall go, '~ said Paul,
laughing, "and as you wish it so earnestly~ I will cer~
tainly comply."              /
$o in about an hour or two afterwards the boys
started. I watched the two graceful figures out of
sight, abA then 'took my accustomed seat on the veran-
(lahi with my book, and Warder, with his nose at my
feet, dozing in the sun.
I was not an eye-witness to the occurrences of this
chapter, but will relate them in the exact words in
which they were told to me by a truthful and impartial
witness.
The young men reached "Merry Hall" a short time
lifter leaving the Lodge. They were received in a
most hospitable manner l~y the host, who ushered them

'I

OR, RETRiBLTTIOIN.         17T

into a large, airy drawing-ro&amp;m, where the company
were assembled, entirely composed of' gentlemen, and
apparently much at their ease, some lounA ng
~    on velvet
divans puffing away at cigars, and others formed into
parties of cribbage, whist, and backgammon, stopping
occasionally iii their games to drink the health, in the
choicest wine, of the prettiest girls in the country.
Why, gentlemen," he said, as the three entered the
drawing-room together, "I had nearly come to the con-
clusion that we were to b~ deprived of your delightful
society to-day; and these gentlemen," pointing to the
loungers and players, "as well as myself were bemoan-
ing our fate mpst piteously."
"Oh! as for me," answered Gerald, "I have been
ready for an age, but this young man here," touching
Paul, "is a fearful procrastinator."
Yes," said Paul, smiling pleasantly, "I suppose II
/ am in fault here, if there is any blame to be attached,
for I was having a chat with my uncle, which detained
me longer than Ii was aware of2'
"Paul seems to be making a virtue of necessity In
having these daily conversations."
A dark frown contracted the young man's face thus
spoken of; and his eyes flashed as lie turned to make a
retort, but his attention was arrested by an exclamation
from one of the chess players.
"Why, Steuart, my boy, is it possible!"
"Why, Leigh, well met! Where did you come
from? Just from the tombs?"
"iDo I look so ghostly?" replied the other, laughing.
"No, not at all; but if T had seen the spirit of my
grandfather I could not have been more surprised."

"Perhaps I can make you think of the spirit of your
grandmother too," said Leigh, as he pointed to a table
where four y-oung men were engagedd at a rubber sof
wh~ist.
- "Well, as I1 live !" exclaimed Paul, "if there ain't
Anthony Gay ! A gay meeting, truly," he continued,
punin~g on the name.
"' And a gay scene," said Eiglh, " for a gay boy is

"sYes," said Anthony, whose attention was attracted
from his game by hearing his name called so often, as
he sprang front the table with both hands extended ;o
Patid, "and we are going to have a gay time of it, boys,
for the sight of you has made my heart as gay Od
light as a bird's," and, he broke out singing the first t vo

" That's right, my friends," said Godfrey, coming
up. " It is better to laugh than be sighing, and now
whilst I 'think of it, life's moments are flying very
rapidly and, we had better be away to the Isles, or I
fear the fish will, be taking an after dinner's nap

and said: "I will llave the horses. ordered," and
left them.
The three young men were still standing in the floor
laughing and talking, when they were somewhat
startled by champagne corks flying in close proximity
to their heads, anti turning they saw a party of about
seven with sparkling wine cups raised to their lips,

wvhilst a voice, which Paul knew but too well, was
saying:
"I propose a toast to old Wayland's daughter, the
lprettiest girl in the country 0!"~
The young man hearing this, gritted his teeth, anti
shrugged his shoulders.
" You don't belong to that party, Stcuart ?" asked
Gay, as he nodded towards the seven.
"No,"~ saidI Paul, emlphatically, shaking his head.
" Nor you, Leigh ?" continued Gay, addressing the
other.
"Not I, indeed, sir," he returned, playfully.
" Then as I think you are two of the best fellows I
ever met, I shall join your standard, and we shall call
ourselves ".The Thirsty Three," for I iust say it is a
dry society you belong ,to."
" Here, give me your hand, Anthony," said Paul,
"fol' you are a mani after my own heart."
"A worthy son of a worthy sire," added the third,
as lie too heldl out his hand to Anthony.
"And proud to be the friend of the worthy Steart,
and the worthy Leigh'" lhe answered, as he shook
wariinly both the extended hands.
The announcement was then made that all was ready,
anid they wended, their way to the sea where their little
boats, whose sails had just been hoisted, were waitino-
to receive them; it wVas not long before they were fairly
launched on the waters, and many a net was thrown
in the wvater to entrap the unsuspecting fish beneath.

he brought in a huge sea turtle; " I am going to send

said, turning to Paul and Leigh. "Sire is going to

pose it" is .to be her turning-out affair, and we arc to
have the jolly set of merry Andrews there," slapping
a young man on the shoulders who had just brought
in a huge salmon, and'whoi all the boys called Andy.
"And' I can tell you who else is to be there," he con-
tinued;- " that pretty little daughter of Captain Way+

I'll tell you something else too, that chap over there,

knows how to be, but he don't know how much, and
what he does know will be too much for- his mother,
for that boy must marry a princess, nothing else will
do her."
"Poor princess," said Leigh, amused, whilst Paul
leaned over and played with the water, igoking some-
what sad,'but he was too cheerful to look that. way
long, and lie soon after turned to Anthony, and said:
" Well, Gay, any more news ?"
"No, nothing else, Only ybu came mighty hear tuiu-

"WXell, gayest of the Gay," said Paul, laughing,
"if It will be any satisfaction to you, I am consoledl."
"If you are, I'm not, and won't be. until I get my
diuner, for I'm awfully hungry ; and how is it with
you, WValter ?" he asked, turning to Lord Leighi
'"I don't know how it is, answered Leigh, "until I

"Isuppose it Is, that you would like fte to give you

ing forth his strong arm.
"Anthony, you are the greatest case in all England,"
replied Leigh, godhmrdy as our bottouched
the island. Here Godfrey Laughton jumped from the
boat, and made a graceful speech inviting the boys to
land1, and leading them to a tastefully erected boxver,
where a sumptuous repast was spread. They were all
soon, as Anthony expressed&amp; it, "hauling in dinner
instead of fish." After refreshing themselves suffi-'
ciently, Paul and Waiter Leigh walked off to a shady
part of the island, and Threw themselves upon the"
ground to have a friendly tete-a-tete. (They had 'been
college friends and were still heart whole, though we
)would not like to say faney free; could we have heard
the frequent mention of Amy, and the airy, fairy Lil-

Paul leaped to his feet and hastened to the spot, fob
lowed by Lord Leigh, and found ther9 two mcn ready
for a duel, one, the heir of' Gordon, the other, Godfrey
Laughton.
"What are you going ~to do,". Paul asked, as he
caine to Gerald's side.
"Kill Laughtoll," was the short answer.
"And this is the returil you make for hospitality
received,'~ said Paul, a little contCmPtU0~lslY
"Go away, and attend to yOtW OWII business," cried
vpice; ,' it shall
Gcrald, in an excite$l and intoxicated
do as I please."
"Not this time,' said Paul, firmly, taking the pistol
out of his nervoUS, trembling hand. "Sit down and
make a man of yourself', no one but a coward fights a
duel."
These words seemed to appease Gerald, and* Paul
raised his voice, saying
"I'll leave it to the party. Are these gentlemen fit
subjects for dueling?"
"And' I answer in the name of' all," said Lord
lL~igh, ",and say that they are not."
"And I, and~ I, aiid I," sai&amp; a dozen otl~rs.
"Then seconds your servic~S are no longer needed,'~
Paul said, addressing the gentlemen who had volun-
teered this office.
Laughton was not so easily gained over as heraldd
and was actually 'foaming with rage; but at length
'Paul, by persuasion and firmness, succeeded ii~ quiet-
ing him.
"A brave man is 'that~. Stenart," said one of the
party te acoInpaflion.

"Ftutli, that he is" he answered. "I \vould not

world, for I would kno~v that my life would be' in
jeol)ardy. But as for that Stenart, I don't believe he'd
be afiiaid of' the old follow himself'."
As they were preparing to leave t~e island, Paul in~
quired of' Anthony Gay the cause of the disaoTeement.
"I doii't know, exactly" he answered; "but that
old Wayland's daughter was at the bo~toin of it."
"And," remarked one of the by-standers, '~'Lis my

in the library and parlor, and throughout the whole
J~od~e an air of comfort prevailed.
I threw my cloak over my shoulders and walked to
Geraldine's, but folUld them all abs~ent. I kaflWd
that Amy was out riding with Gerald notwithstanding
the inclemency of the evening.
"Gerald,' said Nellie, " had insisted upon her going
and would take no excuse,, for the engagement had
been. made ~omc days before, and Geraldine had gone
to visit a poor peasant woman who had a very sick
child, to ofi~r consolation."
I retraced my steps homeward through the woods,
crushing the scrod leaves as I went, with the winds
every ~ow and then playing bandy with my hat, till I
was compelled to use my hands, which I placed on the
top of my head, and then. bade them defiance. When
I reached the Lodge, I[ hung my cloak and hat upon
the rack hi the Hall and walked into the Library.
There sat Paul in the gloaming before the cheerful
grate, his large dog b~~id~ him with his head. upon. his
master's knee, looking into his face with his fond old
eves. The boy had just been on a hunt, for the game

I think he was much comforted by the time our
conversation ended, and he was -just as determined, if'
Amy loved him to fight a battle to obtain her, as lie
had been in all the other affairs of life, to ~vin. So,
throughout the winter and the following spring, his

ntlciintioiis to her were untiririf' and I flOtiCC(1 that
the girl's face was more smiling and her eyes brighter

icy's for a little while, and heard that young Countess,
who is paving a visit to the pretty Lillian, chat-
icr away, and ~sing some favorite airs from Lucia de
Lammernoor and Norma, and some other operas that
I didn't care anything about. I then went to Laugh.
ton's to learn when our next hunting party would
come off."
After this, Gerald remained silent, when Paul asked,
a little spitefully
"how did you leave them all the cottage, Gerald?"
seeing that Gerald was~ not going to acknowledge his
visit there.
Eleanor, whose face was wreathed in smiles, now
re(ldened, ami she said angrily : -

"My son does not the cottage."
"I am sorry you do not know your son as well as I
do," Paul retorted.
"What do you mean by this, sir," said Gerald, rising,
whilst the veins in his temple were swollen with anger.
'E ~erely what my words contained. If you are
ashamed to acknowledge your visit to a lady and to a
lady's house, I ani not ashamed to tell it; for you."
"No matter where my son visits, sir," ptit; in Eleanor,
"it is not your place to bring him to an account for it
and you shall never do it ao'~lin
"That was not my intention, madam," said Pad,
equally provoked, and rising from the sofa upon whh
he was lounging, "but I say when a man is ashamed
to say that he visits a lady that ho does visit, that maut's
intentions are dishonorable, and that he is not a ge a-
tieman."
He then left the room to walk upon the piazza to
cool his temper, for temper was his great fault, and I
was not surprised to see him a little while after take.
his hat and walk away in the direction of the cottage.
That evening later, when I saw two forms walking
along the beach---a graceful girl and a noble-looking
man-~-I felt; that all was going well; an(l when Paul
returned that night and told m6 simply that he had
asked her to be his wife, and that she, with all a
woman's confidence, had given him her love, I thanked
God for making. the boy so happy; the sky seemed so
peaceful and. tranquilly bright, for our hearts were at
peace.

TOLD Eleanor in a day or two our secret.
Perhaps it was not advisable in mc to
1~ have done so, but I thought it was nothing
more than my duty, as she was the only
female relative that Paul had, and she should have
stood to him in the light of a mother. I thought,
too, that it would ease her mind as regarded Gerald,
for she was making herself very miserable about him,
for fear lie would fall in love with Amy. I heard him
tell her one day, when they had some words about her,
that if he chose he would marry her anyhow; that she
could not prevent him, nor his father either. When I
told her of Paul's engagement, there wa~ an expression
in her face which for the first time in my life I failed
to understand; and I noticed that during the following
days she was colder, if possible, in her manners to
Paul, and she still wore the expression that I did not
understand.
I remember one day, whilst sitting in the front ver~
andah, that I noticed Amy's graceful figure coming
towards the Lodge. I had scarcely time to b&amp; sur-
prised at this when she reached the foot of the stairs,
saying:
"Good morning, uncle" (for she always called me
that). "Why ain't you. up and about this glorious
day? Why, the very birds seem to be inviting you
forth."

"No, "-shaking her head and smiling significantly.
"If I were on that you would not think I would turn
my steps in this direction, wouki you?"
"No," I replied, smiling too, and waited for an
explanation.
"I came to see Lady Gordon. Is she at home?"
"Come in, then, and I will have her here in a few
I rang for a servant, and told him to tell Lady Gor~
don that Miss Wayland was waiting to see her.
The domestic bowed and left, and. in a few moments
Eleanor appeared. She greeted Amy. most cordially
(which much surprised me), and took a seat beside her
on the sofa. I was not a little delighted and pleased
to see with what perfect ease and grace little Amy chat-
ted away to this Lady Gordon whom so many held in
awe. After awhile she told Eleanor that she had come
on a very charitable expedition; that both she and
Lillian Grantly had been authorized to go about and
collect alms for several poor families who had been
burnt out of house and home the. night previous, and
who were now in actual destitution. Any assistance
that Lady Gordon would render would be most thank-
fully received.
"I will most gladly assist you," Eleanor answered,
with more warmth than she~ had used for years; "but
pray, Miss Wayland, sit longer," as Amy rose to go.
"No, thank you, Lady Gordon; my mission is not
yet accomplished by any means." Amy then bowed

repeated invitations to visit the Lodge frequently.
T walked otit with her, (IOWIi the lawn to the LoJg~

turned to me an(l said
"Caii you tell me why Lady Gordon was so very
~rracious to me this morning~ '?

God knows, niy child," I answered, feeling any-
thing but easy as I thought about it.

asked
"Are you going io Lady Granfly's ball ?"
"I suppose I must, as Lillian Insists 111)011 it, and
Paul wishes me to go, too."
Oh, yes, my child," I sai(l. "I don't see why you
should not go, as it is to be a very select party, and I
d(n't know why you should not cijoy yourself as well
as other young people."
"I am anxious to go, uncle, and think I will have a

"Remember, Amy, if there is anything I can help

"Thanf~ you many times," she said, looking at me
most affectionately. "U4iele, you are one of my best

"That you ~vill never do," I replied, holding, the
small hand.
"01'! you dont know. .1 am very naughty some-

" Hush!" said Amy, blushing like a sumnier rose.
"I fear'~ they weep for me very often."
"Not for your faults," returned Lillian; "they only
weep to have you wth them."
"Because you are a little angel yourself; Lillian, you
iie(d not think everybody else follo~vs in your footsteps."
" Well, this is decidedly the most complimentary
conversation I ever overheard," exclaimed Lord Leigh,
as he sprang lightly ovcr a fence near us, with his gun
pon his shoulder and a couple of dogs following him.
"Miss Amy, I must admire your penetration and
judgment;" but while lie addressed Amy, he looked
ifltQ the 'soft blue eyes of the young countess with a
depth of love which was not intended for either Amy
or I to understand, but under which the pretty little
creature blushed and smiled, saying:
"So you have been an eavesdropper, 'Walter? It's
a wonder you did not hear something about yourseW

at the Lodge, for wQ were all going, bX~t
none in costume, except the boys. Eleanor
asked me in the evening what my costume was to be.
"That of a gentleman" I answered, bowing gravely,

mock gravity.
We all laughed, and Eleanor told me that I had my
share of self~appreciation.
We did not see the boys in their costumes, for they
sent us word that they would see us at the ball, an~
left in the pony carriage before we were quite ready.

lively strain to Dogberry; and Stradella stood in his
velvet mantle, whispering words of love to his Leo~
nora. You could see anywhere groups of Romeos and
Juliets, 9thcllos and Desdernonas, ilarlequins, and
Merry Ahdre~vs in the mazes of the dance, with Helen
McGregor, Undines, and even a little Topsy, who was
impudent enough to take her place and smile on a fas~
cinating knight. And there was the terrible Katharina
still shaking at Petruchio, and vowing that the moon
W~tStli~ sun.
I sat a little apart with some old friends, and gazed
with delight on this enchanting scene. I had not as
yet seen any of our party, the crowd being so dense;
but presently I caught sight of Lillian, and indeed she
was an airy fairy in her dress of white gossamer, car-
rying a beautiful little wand, which she was playfully
waving over the head of a Cinderella. I heard many
remarks made upon her beauty and simplicity, and
really there was much to admire in this lovely chars'
acter.
My attention was attracted from. her to a couple who
were walking towards a door which led to the conser~
~'atory. Ii leaned ~brward to get a better vie~v, but I

~ouId not see their faces. The gentleman was attired
in. the handsome dress of the Knight of St. John, while
the girl wore a Greek costume. They passed on through
the door, and I did not see them for some time after-
wards. Presently I heard the following remarks from
some of the bystanders, and as they concerned little
Amy, I was all attention.
"They say old Wayland's daughter i~ here some-
where, and that she is a perfect beauty. But let us find
out this Wayland contagion. I want to see her."
"And you will be sure to catch it, like most of the
young men to-night. But come on; let us go and bo
introduced to her."
These two passed out of hearing, but an Eastern
princess standing near speaking to a French field-mar-
shal took up the subject.
"I suppose you have seen 4hat very pretty girl, the
daughter of old Captain Wayland, whom everybody
says is such a case. Their live' in the cottage that is in
that cool, shady grove. It is a pretty place enough I
dare say, but so tiny that one would suppose it was
made for a doll baby. I am sure I should suffocate
~had I to liv~e in a place so small. I cannot see for the
life of me how people can exist in such' small places."
"Yes, it is very distressing," said the other, in what
I thought to be a very sneering voice4 '~ I am very
sure your Royal Highness could never be content with
'love in a cottage.
"Ah! no, indeed; it must be on a larger scale or I
never should survive it. But let me beg you, Mon-
sieur, not to be sarcastic."

"Why, no, your Highness, I had no such intention.
1 do not know the lady in question, but I should like
very much to become acquainted with her."
"And that you shall," said a third, stepping np-a
knight with a waving plume-" for I myself will intro-
Thee you; that is, if I can find hcr~ I have her name
down for a set, and must begin my search, for I cannot
afford to miss the pleasant opportunity of spending a
half hour with so charming a lcrson as Miss Amy."
Then the three walked away, but IL did not fail to
recognize in the independent gait of the man who had
last spoken our old friend, Anthony Gay.
I soon tired of this gay, bright scene, for my spirits
were not exactly in kceping~witIi it. So after partaking
of the refreshments, I ~vent up stairs to a little harp room
which stood at the end of a long corridor; the room
w ~s small and prettily arranged, and hung with green
]~ mask. The harp was pushed into one corner un~
c~ ~rcred, and near it a music staid on which a pile of
sh ~et music was lying. I turned over several of these
sh gets, and as II came to the last I found an 01(1 bal-.
lad, "Hours there were to memory dearer." AhI
wi ~at did it bring back to m~? The remembrance of
a 'toice that was long hushed and at rest, which used,
in plaintive tones, to sing this; every word of that 01(1
song brought back to me "bright Visions of the past."
I again, in thought, went over that period of my early
manhood, remembering those sunny smiles, and nearly
every word those lips had uttered, and as IL read this
rtanza in the song:

IL kid (lown the sheet, and pasSC(l my hand t~vo ot
three times over my brow to shut out the visions of
years ago. I then walked to the window and draw-
ing back the heavy curtains,~ took my seat in the
deep embrasure, drew the curtains to again, and looked
out on the night. The sea was flo~viug slowly on,
silvered by the moon's pale rays, while all around
was peaceful and serene, except from below, where I
could still hear the strains of music a2~ the dancers'
merry feet, and I knew the revelry was still at its
height. I was glad to be alone here in this quiet spot,
and had determined to enjoy its solitude. I had takeii
out a cigar with the intention of lighting it, when a
slight, noise in the room awakened my attention; a cou-
j)lC entered, a lady and a gentleman. When I saw them
through a slight opening iii the c~irtain, they were
standing, in the centre of the room, at a little table,
and lie was pouring out for her a glass of water. I
saw that it was the Knight of St. John and the Greek
girl; but what was my astonishment1 when, turning
their faces towards me, I recognized Paul and Amy.
I don't knQw why I did not address them but it
seemed to me I had lo~t the i)ower either to speak or
move; perhaps it was the troubled expression I saw
in the face of one, and the anxiety depicted on the
face of the other that kept me sileiit. They took a
seat on a little velvet divan, and reluctantly I heard
the following short conversation:
'K , Amy, you must tell me what he said. to you,
for Gerald Gordon is no friend of mine, Perhaps I
~tn~ more uneasy thaim may be necessary about all these

199

things, but YOU are so very dear to me, that it may
be this that makes me so."
"I wish I hadn't said anything to you about it,
Paul, for you worry yourself so unnecessarily. Don't
you know that all Gerald Gordon could say in a life-
time would not affect me, me that you call your daunt-
less Amy?"
"I know that, but still it is only right that you
should tell mc everything, for we have more enemies
than friends just now."
"Oh! I am so sorry, Paul, that I said anything to
you about it. You xviii just worry yourself to death."
"Nay, my darling," lie answered, tenderly, "if this
would be my only trial, I would most gladly submit
to it, 1)ut I I-"
Here she finished the sentence, saying:
"Why, you arc so superstitious."
"No, I am not that, but even if I were I have had
no reason for such gloomy indulgence; but if you
knew the world and its people like II do, you too would
be restless and uneasy."
They were silent for a few moments, when Paul
SPoke:
"You ~ tell nie what Gerald said to you,
Amy?"
"Oh ! yes, I will, iC you insist upon it?
~'" Then I do insist upon it," he answered.
"Very well. When he asked me to be his wife,
and I told him I coul(l not and would not, lie said,
desperately, that I should, and that he had the means
in his own hands, and cost what it would, that Ii
should be his wife."

*         ~

" Then it shall cost him his life," said Paul ,rising
to his feet, and trembling with emotion.
A faintness seemed to come over me as I heard these
words, but I sjill had not the power to move.
Oh ! Paul, Paul," said the girl, '" do sit down and
dent get SO tiiig'Vy. it cannot injure us U() matter what
he says.
"Auw," he said, taking his place by her side, and

would rather see you sleeping quietly l)encatll I he flow-

them high and lOW,
"i)on't von know your are~ to be our vis-a-vis ~.w
the next set?
They answered him, both assuming very gay tones,
and the three descended to the iancing-ro6mns together.
When II was~ again alone, I felt as if every object
was swimming around. and if had not gained entire
command over myself, when a second couple entered
the harp rc~om. What was ~my surprise, and displea-
sure too this time, when I recognized Capt. Waylaid
and Eleanor. They took their seats on the sofa that
the two' young people had just vacated.
This wily, artful woman, and this world-hardened
man. I was as unable, as I was before, to move or
say anything, or I would not have listened to the~r~
conversation, for I felt that it was not right, arid iii
my inmost soul knew that it boded no good, but the

201

nightmare that possessed me would not Ict me leave,
or make them eons~ious of my presence.
E1eai~or opened the conversation, by saying:
"This affair has, for a long time, engaged my atten-
twa and intei;cst. it is needless for me to say to you
how very dear your daughter is to me. She is so very
charming an(1 agreeable, J am quite sure my son woulfi
never surVive die loss of her, ari(l there arc none who
woul(1 so well grace the House of Gordon as your
1)eautiful child, a rid I wish most truly that this mar-
riw'e be consummated as soon '~s possible."
'6
"The honor which you confer upon me, my lady, is so
exalted, that I have not the words to express mygrati-
hide, and I assure you your wish shall be gratified as
early as practicable. Of course, I shall leave nothing
undone, au(l my highest wish shall be realized when T

"You arc most lavish in~ your compliments, sir,
but we will adjourn to the rooms below, now that this
affair isso agreeably and satisfactorily arranged, and I
will see my son, and in the course of the evening will
let you know what will be the most suitable~ time for
its fulfillment.
As these last words were spoken. they made their
exit. I once more breathed freely, and was rising
from my seat and about to take my departure. when I

TROUBLE FOR PAUL AM) A1'~tY.
[~~'~i lIE next morning~ I awoke front a feverish
b
and unquiet sleep, my dreams had beeti so
frightful that I prefcri~el getting up early,
though no one in the house was yet astir.
Being fatigued front the last nights (lissipatlon, I
threw open my shutter and the first carol of
the early l)irds, and the cool morning breezes which
fanned .rny burning brow. As I said, my r1rca~ is
the night before had been very frightful, and thl')T,
'together with the two conversations I had heal d,
left me in a state of nervous excitement. But after
I had said my prayers, and refreshed myself by a
cool bath, I felt much more corn posed, and was al le
to take my book and my accustomed plane near t ~ie
window, and to read until the sun had kissed the d~w
drops from the flowers, an(l my little repeater on the
mantle told me it was the hour of eleven. Then all
were awake at the Lodge, but 1 did not leave' i ay
room, for the view from my window was so beaut~ u1
that I could sit for hours and look at it. Presei~tiy
there came a tap at my door, and I bade the visitUP
enter. I was not surprised when the door opened to
see that it was Paul, for there was ~carcely a morniiig
that he did not come to greet rue, and to ask me how
I was. But I was surprised when I looked up into
his face to see a frown upon hi~ brow, an(l white lines
about his mouth which denoted great pain. his step

I.

was as firm an(l as stea(ly, and there wa~ no tremor in
his voice and his hand as lie handed me an open note
and asked mc to read it; he theh drew a chair,, near
the window, and leaning his head upon his hand,
looked wearily out upon the moorland. I took the /
note, which had been written by a trembling, nervous
hand, and read the following disconnected lines
"Oh! Paul, Paul, it seems as if Iod's mercy is estranged from
me this morning. how am I tell you what happened' last night
whilst we were pligliting anew our vows. You seemed to have
seen in the future what I could not. Come to me, if you can,
after breakfast, and I will tell you all; but one little word to you,
my noble Paul, I am your 'dauntless Amy ' yet, and shall be true
to The last."
"The poor child, the Poor chili," I thought, "what
can I do for her. God help them 1)0th."
"Never mind, my boy," I said, as I drew my chair
closer to him, and laid my hand upon his shoulder.
"Never mind, it may not all l)C as bad as you think
it is."
"Do you know what it is?" he said, turning
towards me, with burning cheeks, and flashing eye.
"YesI know what it is all about."
"And then you tell me noUc mind."
it was the first irritable word he ever spoke to me.
Ille rose front his seat, and with that same determined
step, and that s~arne firm look I had noticed iii the
library on that November evening when lie spoke of
Amy and Gerald, and paced the room several times
and thieii left it, shutting the door violently behind
him, and walked across the passage t~ his own chain-
bei'. 11 sat for a few moments only after he had left

me. it was not a man to idle away time in thinking.;
I was soon up and doing. I crossed over to his room,
and told him in a very determined manner that he
must go right away to Amy's, see Capt. Wa~rland, and
remind him oC the promise he had. made him some
weeks before, and see Amy too, and try in some way
to arrange matters so that they would be less disagree-
able. This was his intention anyway.; or, otherwise,
in hi~ present mood, he might have been a little rebel-
liotis. lie took up his hat withoUt saying a word,
and we walked out together. I told him to meet me
at the beach, that I would await him there, then bade
God bless him, and watched his retreating figure out
of sight.
When I reached the beach, It walked hastily up and
down, feeling tired ~enough of life now, and trying to
rack my brain for some expedient by which I could
free these two young beings, who were ~o dear t~ my
heart, ~'rom their oppresSiolb To have - spoken to
1~Aeanort would have been a little less tha1n lunacy; she
was doing her work, and III saw that she was determined
to do it well; and old Wayland-i knew the man too
well~would have sacri aced the heart of his poor young
birding to have seen her mistress of the rich lands of
Gordon. What was' it to him her paling cheeks and
tearful eye? the title woukl mend all that. "Ah! this
tyrannical father, this brutal husband I"' I sighed
wearily, as Ill thought of the little use of appealing to~
him. Poor Amy! poor Paul! I wished that this mur-
muring sea would bear us a~vay on its bosom to some
unknown land, where we would be at rest. I turned

from the great heaving waters to meet the poor boy as
I espied him coIning towards me. I saw disappoint.-
meiit and grief depicted in every alinement of his face.
"\Yell, Paul, what was your success?"
"All gloomy enough, uncle," he ans~vercd drearily.
"I would not mind myself so ihuch; but poor Amy!"
At this he broke down completely and threw himself
in desperation upon the sand, looking gloomily over
the unbroken waters.
" Amy,'~ he continued, afier a pause, "told mc that
he~ father vowe(1 that these nuptials shall take place in
the chapel at Gordon on the 21st of this month-ten
days from to-day."
We shall see," I heard him say tinder his breath,
He then spoke aloud
" I made every effort in my power to see Captain
W.tyland, but lic~ took good care to keep out of my
way, sending me word that it was irot worth while to
tal k the matter over; that he was determined; his mind
was irrevocably made up, an ci it would only be a dis...
ag7ceable interview."
Ii saw the boy clench his hands so tightly he: e that
th~ nails penetrated the flesh, and I felt very safe at
that moment in not being Capt~iin Wavlan~d. He pres.-
ently rose to lis feet, and we took our way back to the
Lodge in silence. I felt that we would have to weather
this storm, and I ~)rayed inwardly that, with a Chris.-
tian resignation, my boy would bear the wrongs he
would have to endure. "God tempers the wind to the
shorn lamb," was the only remark I ventured to make

I saw Lord Gordon look after his retreating figure,
then at Eleanor and gerald, and then at me, and as hit;
glance was not returned, we finished our breakfast in
silence
I sat toyifl~ wjth my spoon, l)alaflcing it tij)Oi1 the
edge of my cup, whilst my thoughts were busy upon
other thmo~s I resolved to ~'o an(l see Geraldine, to
try if anything could be done. So, after we rose i'roin
the table, I walked hurriedly to the cottage. When I
knocked at the cottage door, it was opened to me by
old Nellie. Marks of recent weeping had swollen her
kind old. eves, and my own voice was husky when I
asked for her mistress, at seeing the old woman there
with hcr sympathizing face. She led me to her nus-
tress' room in silence.. There, lying on a cottage bed,
was the fond, doting mother, pale and tearless, speak-
ing wor{15 of comfort to her only. child. Indeed it
pleased me much to see the 'little Amy bearing all thi:;
with true patience, though she was as pale as a lily, and
her mouth find her lips were compressed; but there was
spirit in her eyeM, and II knew that it was no weak char-

acter they had to deal wit Ii ; only (1~WO duriiv" that v4t
did I see a look come I rito her face which was so weary
aIl(1 so sa(l that it melted my very heart ~o tears.

I shook my head.

"iNever niind me," the g ri answered slowly.

lCaflC(l over an(l asked Geraldine jf nothinc9 would

"No, no. I ~d. not suppose anything will. ife

"I wonder if lie will see me?"
"I f~ar not. lie positively refused to se.~ Paul, and
ii ~u p pose you will fare no better."
en I will compel him," was my answer.
But I was not so good as my word, for the man
evadd me as a fi.~h does a hook for the next week, nor
did I see him until the ten days had elapsed. And
now, as I think over it, it might~have been so much
better that I did not, for heaven only knows what might
have been the consequence, as my indignation and con-
tempt knew no bounds; and when I fiAt h~w that poor
tender blower was treated, torn by so rude a hand
which should have shielded it from every blast, my
excitement was beyond control.

face and The dimness of his eyes that sleep had failed
to visit him the night before. I sat by and tried to
console him and make him think that it was all for the
best that he should be so stricken. He shrugged his
shoulders a little annoyed, saying:
"II)o you suppose I am going to let this thing go on
without making some resistance?"
I thought the boy's mind was wandering a little, and
t~~ed to turn the conv~rsation into a different channel;
but I still noticed that old determined look in his face,
and I felt that there was something that he was keeping

it was about a note; that when he' heard the angry

~[IE DEATH OF GERALD.

&amp;~I7 HE ninth day da~vned bright and warm, but
1~
sultry and Ol)iWeS3i ye. The sun was s'~ warm
Q. S~, that every living thing vent to the shade.
~ Even the cattle sought SOHIC leafy bough to
shelter them from the burning rays. It seemed too
warni Itr tli~ bees to gather honey front the flowers;
c~en if they had attempted it they would have been
disappointed, for the leaves were withering and closing
beneath the August sun. 'Twas the 20th of the month,
and to~morrow-oh ! would that to-morrow would
never come!
Our breakfast was eaten in as perfect silence ti tis
morning as on the morning after Ihe ball. Some ti~ ac
after we had finished, Ge~'ald met his mother in the
hall, saying:
"Mamma, I'm going to B- this morning. Ii have
been iff~tending going for some time, and think this is
just as good as any. I want to see some old friends
there anyhow, and you know if I do not ~o to-day I
will not have another chance."
"But, my darling, you will burn up if you attempt
it. For pity sake, do not go.
"Oh! yes, I must~ You knew I am not sugar;

"But II do not wan~you to go, my son," persisted
the mother. "I want you with me to-day. Do not~

if you go away fro~n me. And besides, I will see so
little of you in the next f~w months. You will go
then, my son?" she continued, as she saw him buck-
ling on his spurs.
"Yes, I will, mamma. You speak as if you were
going to lose me altogether. I am sure I will be a~
much with you after I am married as I am now.
Besides, I mast go."
"I amvery, very sorry to see you so determined,
my boy. I would much rather you would not leave
rue. I do not feel very well, and if you go it will only
make me worse."
"I do not see what my going has to do with your
health, mamma. I dare say you will feel better
presently."
"And will nothing keep you, my de~ar sos.?" she
asked once more, so earnestly that II really felt for her.
"Nothing," was the short answer, and shortly after
this, I saw him' mount his horse, and his mother went
up to him, saying, for the last time:
"Do notgo, my son."
"Oh! yes, I must, mamma."
'Then kiss me again, darling, and take care of
yourself."
She walked int6 the cool passage and took a seat on
one of the sofas, and, for the first time in my life, T
heard her sigh wearily.
All that part of the morning I saw little of Paul.
When I did meet him he was silent and seemed not to
care to speak to me. And indeed I thought it was for
the best that we should havc~ no more conversations


just then, for, God knows, I could do no good in renew-
ing the subject. After luncheon he left the Lodge, and
I sat alone iii the library as the evening ~vore on, and
watched the heavy clouds as they gathei'cd thick and
fast in tl~e west, betokening a storm.
I saw Eleanor from time to time looking anxiously
at the road that wound around the moorland and then
at the gloomy aspect of the sky, and turning to inc
once, she asked:
"Do you think Gerald has had time to be back,
Johfr?"
"It depends upon the swiftnes~3 of his steed and the
business he was on. But, in any case, he has hard ly
had time to be back yet, Eleanor."
She gave another glance at the dreary road, and tiir 1-
ing away with a sigh quite as heavy as the one she had
heaved in the morning, walked to her room.
Somewhere between six and seven I went up L~ my
own room. Black and lowering clouds were spread
over the sky au4 not a ~ Of blue wa3 anywhere to
be seen. Ndw and then the distant rumbling of thun-
der was heard, seeming to awake the calmness of the
sea, which was rapidly becoming troubled, lashing up
its foam, as it groaned and heaved beneath *he gather-
ing tempest. And as my litth~ repeater rang out the
hour of seven it was quite dark in my room.
I sat by my window, which was still -open, watch-
ing the fearful but magnificent sight, and, listening to
the artillery of heaven as it rolled across th9 vast body
of water in one continuous roar. After a while the
yivid lightning came flash after flash aild, like an

rain, dashing with such fury that it robbed the flow-

had not been in unison I should have shrunk from its
fury; but there I sat looking over the dreary moor-
lan(1, an(1 as the lightning changed its form and came
iii great sheets woIll(l look vast and gloomy. There
was the grove of firs, which I would catch sight of
every now and then, looking more dismal than ever.
My room was as l)laek ~rs midnight. I suppose the
terrified servants had forgotten to bring me lights,
and, indeed, Ii do not think I world have allowed them.
if they had come, for I enjoyed the solemnity~ of the
sc~ne, and the distant lashing and gro'ining of the sea,
in concert with the booming thunder, accorded too
ivlI with my frame of mind to wish to have it dis-
hi rhed. Though the st6rm had somewhat abated it
was fearful enough still, and a heart less brave than
mine would have shut out as much of its horrors as
possible. Old Patrick came iii (luring the course of ~t,

leaned her head wearily against the post of the bed.
She rose presently and went to the Wjiidow, drc~v
1)ack the curtain, and looked out li~)Ofl the night. I.
saw her shudder, and 31 went and put my ann around
her and took her away. I closed the curtains together
again, and be~ed her Once U~OVC to try to COlUpOSO
herself.
She took her lamp and walked to the dooi and
turning~to me agaii~, said:
"John, must I send for him ? "
"Yes, do, 'Eleanor, if it will ease your mind at all,
and, if you wish it, I will go myself"
She paused and hesitated, and then said : "Perhaps
I am uselessly annoying myself; but at any rate,~ II
don't wish you to go."

I heard many footsteps below passing up and down,
and loud and soft voices, and then one shriek, which
~was so painful that it made my very l)lOOd curdle. I

honed one of the men to ~Lt me, and we raised her

for the family PlVsieian an(I then went back to the
corpse. A feeling of faintness came over me, so that I
staggered and fell into a chair near that bloody bier,
to watch during the rest of~ the night. There, too, sat
the stricken father at his son's head ,gazingin mute
agony on that l)ale and rigid face, his own rivalino' it
in whiteness, whil ~t every now and then a convulsive
sob shook his frame. His agony was so o'r

"Under the grove of firs in the east end of the

I leaned over and put my hand on. the heart to see
if there was any sign of life there; but no I no! it was
still as the grave which would soon claim it as its own.
his watch, portuilonie and diamond ring, and every-
thing of value was still on his 1M~~'~fl, showing. that
the ~55~55j~~5 hand that had cut him down did not do
it for pecuniary motives. The body could not be
removed until the coroner's inquest was held; and oh!
how those dreary hours dragged on, until the coming
dawn, whilst 11 sat stroking from time to time the damp
curls from the death-dewed boyish brow, and thinking
how little should we set our hearts on anything earthly
that must pei~sh and die. Can I ever 'forget that fear-
ful night? Al~ ! no, indeed! it 'is indelibly impressed
upon my memory, and I seem, even now, to 'hear the
501)5 and shrieks of that poor stricken mother, calhino'
upon her child to come back to her, "that he was not
dead " "it could not be." " Ah ! no, my beautiful boy,
'with all your fair promises of youth, health and strength
you have uot~gone from me, my son, you will come back,
to your ,mother's heart." ~hc would then relapse into
a painful silence only to' be broken l)y fresh bursts of
sorrow. Calling upon God to restore her her child,
anti telhino'~ Him He was not merciful in taking him
from her. "What is all this world to me if I have
him not?" Then raising herself on one arm, and
looking at me with a face so eorpse4ikc that I shiud-
dered, she said:'
"John Merddith, who killed my child?"

OR, T~EPRIPjJTToN.

Ii shook lily hea(1, for I could not answer; but she
answered for me.
"II know who did it, and f will avenge you, my
murdered love, my poor lost darling. May I never
rest iii case either in soul or 1)ody until I see the one
who (lid this cruel deed brought to j justice "
"iDo be quiet, Eleanor," I said, laying my hand
upon her arm, "you arc wil(l with grief and excite-
ment; try awl COfl)~Q5C yourself; and God will coin-
fort you."
"Yes, God !" she answered, frantically; "it looks as
if He would comfort me who has robbed me of every
earthly ~omfort and broken my heart."
I felt that consolation here would have as little
effect as the soft rains of heaven on the solid rock.
Paul tried several times during the remainder of that
night and the nuxt day to approach her to oiler sym-
~)athIy, but was each time rudely repulsed. At this I
did not feel very much surprised, for .1 knew that she
had never loved him, and she could not have forgotten
yet the animosity that the boys bore t~ each other
lately. Lord Gordon had not uttered a word Since
his son's murder had been made known to him. This
was truly a blow to him, for, like Eleanor, Gerald was
his only hope, and he felt all a father's love for the
lifeless 'form beside him. The authorities had not* yet
arrived. Ii left Eleanor's room to take another look
at that face in death, which in hifb had claimed more
of ITIJ ~)ity than my love ; and as if gazed upon it so
pale itnd cold, from which the soul had fled, II felt the
tears melting in my' eyes and chasing each other dQWg

with my hand, and felt once more for the pulse th~d

before and which was now 5tilled, I kneW but too well
that the reaper had cut down this delicate plant iii its

HE officers came carly in the morning, and
the verdict rendered was "death by assassi-
~ nation." The body was then dressed for
~ interment arid laid out in the front drawing-
room, the frcshe~t and loveliest flowers having been
brought to deck it. The whole affair created the most
intense excitement, and many came to offer consola-
tion to the bereaved family. We did not let Eleanor
know when the body ~vas to be removed, for the doctor
was already uneasy for fear her mind would be injured
by this terrible ordJal. So, noiseles~ly and silently we
bore it away to its narrow home, and I lingered after
the crowd had given way and knelt upon the tomb that
continued all tha.t was left of that mother's bright
dream and a father's proudest arnbition---~there in his
narrow cell, with the sea singing his requiem. After It
arose from my knees, I found that another form had
been kneeling and that I was not alone, and I felt
proud of my boy to see how deeply grieved he was at
the untimely end of his young relative and how entirely
forgetful of how, if he had lived, he would have crossed
his path and marred all his earthly happiness.
Eleanor lay iii a perfect stupor for the next day or
two. She asked mc once "if the murderer was found."

"Mv God!" \X~S all I could say, and everything
became dark I felt as if an iron hand was clasping my
throat, and I fell insensible at the men's feet.
When I returned to consciousness, there was quite a
little crowd collected around me, and my old friend,
Dr. Arnold, was rubbing my hand. One or two of the
old servants from the Lodge were there, Patrick being
one of them, and were sobbing like children, while
near the prisoner stood the noble form of Lord Leigh
and the light and graceful one of Anthony Gay. They
were both sj)eaking to Paul, telling him "that no mat-
ter what the verdict said, t hey would believe, as they
did now, from tlieh' very hearts; that lie was innocent."
Murmurs of discontent were heard in the crowd, which
was rapidly increasing' for here was the man who had
extended his hand to the poor and had given charity to
the widow and the orphan, who had been received into
the halls of the noble and great, being one of the
brightest ornaments there, and to whom none could
have imputed an act unworthy of the Christian and the
geutlemaii, stigmatized as a murderer.

~~'as JJaUon. I went to see, and came back an(l told

and he went directly to it. I ~ttpp~s~ it was half an
hour, or perhaps three-quarters, after that when I went
myself to see if he wanted anything. I opened the
door softly and saw hun sitting at the window smoking
a cigar, looking oat U~Ofl the sky in the direction of his
home. II asked him if he had slept any. 'No,' was
the moody answer, and then in the same breath, 'Get
my horse Ii want to go down to Dalton's.' (Dalton
was one of the young men who had visited him that
day.) In about ten or fifteen minutes after that I saw
him riding at full speed in the direction of his friend's.
I don't kno~v exactly how long after this it was before
he cime back, but suppose it, was an hour and a half or
tw~ hours. His horse was smoldng and foaming with
hard riding and he himself seemed to be very much
fatigued. lie threw himself upon two chairs in my
public room and closed his eyes. I went up to him
and asked him if he wouldn't lie down. He answered
'no,' and then ordered his supper, telling me to make
haste, as he ~Yanted to go home. He closed his eyes
again, and I went to haVe supper prepared for him.
I' It was now very dark, and the storm had just
begun to rage without. When his supper was ready I
went in myself to wait upon him. He ate very little
and complained, 1l~at the coffee was not good and that
the waffles hadn't risen well. I mack no answ~ r, for I
saw that he was out of sorts. He stayed a long time
at the table alker he had finished, toying with his tea~~
spoon. Whenever I spoke to him he answered me in
monosyllables or very abruptly. iearirfg some one

him 'no.' 'What can 1)0 keeping him?' he said,
whilst an angry fro~vn contracted his brow. 'He prom-
ised to be here at eight.' 'It is twenty minutes after
eight, sir, and I don't suppose he ~vi1l come in such a
storm,' I ventured to remark, lie rose from the table
then and looked out. The lightningj4~hed in his face
as lie opened the door. 'This is enough to wake the
dead,' he said, as the flash was followed by a burst of
b          ~    'I

horse quicldy~' 'Oh! sir,' I pleaded, '(10 not go out
in such a tempest. You may he killed by the light-
ning.' 'I 'want my horse,' he repeated. I had the'
poor animal ordered, and it was somewhat refreshed
with its meal of oats a!d short rest. After the horse
was brought around, the deceased1 hesitated about going.
I suppose he returned twenty tiin~s after starting, some~
times to ask one question, then another, and another
time made the excuse that he wanted to light his cigar,
that the rain had put it out. The last time he came
back he asked me to lend him an umbrella, and I went
into my wife's room to get one. She was sick at the
tinie and ~Iie had to have an opiate every hour. $he
reminded me of it as I entered the room, and I[ looked
at the clock and saw that the hands pointed to nine. I
lingered in the room a few moments after she had taken
it, and then wcnt out into the public room. The
deceased was sitting at a little side-table, with his head
in his hands, lie did not notice my entrance, and I
was very quiet, and I know that it must have been at
least a quartet of an hour before he roused~himself.

lie started uj~ suddenly and asked for the umbrella.
The storm was now at its height, and as he opened the
(loor the ~aiii da-~hed iii lii torrents flud the thunder
rocked the horse l&amp;liC a era(lle. I VQUtIV'ed 011CC more
h           to~ beg him no~ to go, but he made no answer, and. in a
fc~ moments 1 heard him u:'ging his horse at full
speed.
" How long (10 you suppose it would have taken liiui
* to ride from your house to Gordon Lodge ? " asked tlie*
judge.
The man replied without any Iwsitid ion
"It is measured te~i English miles. The deceased
always. rode the finest and most spirited horses. The
one he rode this particular evening ~vas to be sure a
little 1aded and the condition' of the roads was not
good. So, I would say, reckoning all this, it wouki
'take him fall two hom~'.~."
The next witness called was Michael Daisy, Lady
Grantley's gardener. Thir 01(1 man in giving in his
~evidence would tell his own story, much to the amuse~
mont of some present:
"Well," he began. I had gone on the 19th of
August to sit at the wake of Andrew Murphy, who had
died that morning of fever, at six o'clock, in company
with Patrick Donahoe and Timothy Noonan. Poor
Andrew-the Lord rest him-lived two miles on the
north side of the grove of ft:~s on the moorland. At
eleven oAock that iiight I was; sitting at the wake."
" Jiow do you know it was eleven o'clock, Michael ?"
asked the couusel.

which went out of my bead entirely, and I thouo'ht
what a drenching their pretty heads xvo~ild get, fr the
rain was coming down a~ if the sea was turned l)ottom

their dresses altogether if I (li(1 not go to them ; and
then I thought ~of my Lady's sad face when she saw
that t~hey were spoilt. I asked Patrick I)unahoe tq

he answereKl, before. I had time to speak, 'it is a horse~
and no rider upon him. Ii suppose th~ poor fellow
has been struck by the lightning.' 'Faith, it looks bad
enough,' said I, 'butt let us go here to the firs and shel-'
ter ourselves a while.' So in ! stepped ~nd Tim fbi-
lowed me. I had' walked in a few steps, when I stum-
bled over something and fell, and felt that it was the
form of a man. I called Tim, and he came to me by
the sound of my v6i~e,. and I told him to feel and see
what it was. lie felt it, and said, ' yes, that it was a
'man, that the poor creature must have been killed hy
the lightning, and that must have been 'his horse we
had just seen.' I' had a match-box in my pocket, so I
to6k it out and struck a light. I told Tim to hold his
hat up, so the rain would no1t fall upon it. He did so,
and I saw by the light of it a man lying with his face
downwards~ and, blood running from his head. One of
the big firs had been struck by lightning, and I thought
the poor fellow had been hit by one of the branches.
"We turned hioi over and saw it was the young Lord
at the Lodge. One of his hands was grasping his coat
near his heart ~ the other had a gash on it right across
the fingers, like it had been cut with a knife. I felt
my blood run cold as I looked at him, and. it was a ter-
rible sight, your Lonor. We ran back to the wake and
told the men there, who came with us immediately.
We made a rude kind of frame by the light of the Ian-
tern we had, and* we lifted the poor thing from the
ground and laid him upon it, and carried it home to
~his poor mother., And I pray the good Lord that I
may never see such a sight again if I live to be as old
as Mathusalum.".

This was Michael's evidence, and he ~tood all the
questions and cross-questions without deviating the
least from it. lie was then asked what time he sup-
1)OSed it ~va~ when he came to the grove the first time.
lie said ho could not tell exactly, but when they went
back for help to the wake it was a quarter to one, and
that it was two by the big clock at the Lodge when
they laid the body in the hall. As I said before, it
was impossible to prevent Michael from going on in
his own simple way, and as he was a very important
witness there was not much objection made.
The next witness was Timothy Noonan, and as his
evidence coincided with Michael's i~ every particular,
I will not give it here.
Old Patrick was the next witness called. There
were tears in his aged eyes, and his voice often choked
w th emotion as he gave the following evidence:
"I have been with the Prisoner from his infancy to
hi ~ manhood and he was as lovely a boy and as noble
a ~an as ever the bright rays of the sun shone upon.
II e was a model of honor, truth and moral worth, and
wis as gentle and as tender as a woman in dispositionn"
(iJe here paused to brush away ~ tear that was trick-
ling down his honest face.) lie~~~as then asked if the
deceased and the prisoner had been on amicable terms
with each other up to the time of the murder.
lie answered:
"No, he did not 'think they lived upon exactly ami-
cable terms, though generally they were very polite
and gentlemanly towards each other."
lie was then asked what he meant by saying that he

Patrick was then told tq give 'all the particulars of
the quarrel, and he did so in the following words
"On the evening of the 18th, the prisoner came in
some time after the dinner-hour. I3oth the prisoner
and the decease~i left the Lodge soon after breakfast
that morning, separately. Ii went to the prisoner's

dining-room. Shortly after this, the deceased entere(1,
and soon a~er joined the prisoner at the table. I was
there when he came in, and noticed that they did not~
speak to each other. I remained but a few moments
after that in the room-I wa~ called awiiy to attend to'
~oinething I had neglected that morning in an adjoin~
in~ room. I don't know how long I had been there
when I heard very loud voices fi'om the dining-room.
I could not tell what the words were that were uttered,
V
but I went in as speedily as possible, and found that the
prisoner hzd arrested the arm of the deceased, in the

I

haiid of which was a loaded pistol. They were both
very much excited. I was too frightened to remcm~
1)er what was said by either of them, but, shortly after
I entered, the prisoner let the deceased's arm go. The
(leceased then rushed, at the prisoner with the intention
of' strul(ing him, but the 1)10w was parried, and t!:e.
prisoner knocked the deceased down and left the room.
J did not see. the prisoner ac'aun until the next even-
Jug, when he came back between cloven and twelve, or
I think it was nearer to twelve, though I do riot
exactly remember. i, myself; opened the door for him.
lIe was very wet from the rain, and stopped in the
passage to hang his hat up."
"I)id lie speak to you, or did you notice any agita-
tion in his manner?" lie was asked.
"Yes "answered the old man, slowly, "but he bade
me good night as usual, and lei't the room."
lIe was here questioned and cross-questioned a grcat
(loal, but lie gave the same answers all the time. lie
was then told to go on, an(l lie contiiiue(l
"I soon after went to~?rnv own room to prepare for

hun shed tears, and lie remained near the bier the
whole night, and no inducement would 1)erSU~dC him
to leave it. Even at the grave lie hingercd longest,
and h~d a look of real pam in his face."
lie was here cross1uestioned again, ~nd this finished
his evidence.
The next called up was Manning, the head dining-
room servant at the Lodge, whQ was present during
the quarrel between'the two young mcii.
It is unnecessary to give aft of his~evidence, so I
will only give the part that related to the quarrel, as
the rest of it ~o1neided with Patrick's.
He becran:
"On the evening of the 18th of August, I was in
the dining-room when~ the prisoner caine in. He sat
down at the table in science, and I suppose had been
there tQn or fifteen minutes when the deceased entered.
lie, also; took his place a&amp; the table in' silence, and
only staid there a few minutes and did not eat much.
As he rose to leave, he drew his handkerchief from his
pocket7 and, in doing so, a note dropped from his pocket

ii

to the floor, very near tl~e prisoner, who picked it up
and said Th was his own. 'ft is not yours,' said tho
deceased, coming up to him. 'I say i~t is,' answeredd
the prisoner, 'and I wish to know how it came into
your possession?' I do not remember the deceased's
answer, and there was a great deal more passed between
them that I do not remember. At length the deceased
went to snatch the note from the prisoner's hand, who
raised his arm to strike him. The deceased then drew
a revolver, but the prisoner arrested it before lie had
time to fire."
The rest of the evidence the4 reader is acquainted
with, and it is too painful for me to repeat it here.
This witness expatiated largely on the merits of poor
Gerald; for Some reason of his own, making his
evidence as hard on the prisoner as possible. I saw
Lord Leigh frown angrily several times whilst he was
speaking, and heard Anthony Gay, who was also near
me, call him repeatedly a villain.
Thelast witness was Godfrey Laugh ton.
lie apl)roached the ~witness stand with the same ease
and grace that always characterized him, and in his
high4oned, cultivated voice gave in his evidence thus:
"I have kno~~n the prisoner about two years, but i[
cannot say that I have known him intimately. He
was generally cold and stiff' in his demeanor towards
me, though always gentlemanly. I think, from my
own personal knowledge of him and the deceased, that
they were not on good terms. I overheard a conver-
sat ion, on the the evening of the 10th of Aixgust, at
Lady Grantly's, which convinced inc of this fact. I

was in Lady Grantlv~s harp-room, in one of the win-
dows smoking, when ti1L~ prisoner ana a lady entered.
I paid little at tention to what they were saying until
I heard the prisoner exclaim : ' If Gerald Gordon
insists upon marrying Miss Waviand it will cost lilni
his life ! ' Almost immediately alter this they left the
room)
Laughton was here asked if he did not see t'he lady,
too. He answered positively, "Ao,~ that he was seated
so that he could only'see tho gentleman ; "nor could I
have recognized the tones of her voice, for they were
vet~v low and s&amp;t."
(I had also noticed on that eventful night how
softly and sweetly Amy spoke in the harp-room, and
I could not help but a(lmire and feel grateful to
Laughton for his dehcacv in thus preventing hei~ being
brought before the eourL)
The witness continued
"I did not see the prisoner after that until the 19th
day of Auaiiist. One of mv tenants had died that
morning, and I went down' to s~e if Ii could~ do any-
thing for his distressed family. On. my return, as~ I
approached the grove of firs on the moorland, I was
somewhat surprised at seeing the prisoner emerge from
the2rn. He scarcely recognized me, seemed very much
agitated, and walked away as rapidly as possible. I
saw him again that night, somewhere about eleven. I
had gone to Andrew Drew's, an old friend of mine,
who lives at Mount Fair, some timq before the storm
eommeneefi. The time was very pleasantly spent, and
it was iiear ten ~'eloek when I arose to return home.

IMy friend begged inc to remain with him, as it was
raining very heavily. I told him an old soldier did
not flhill(l tli~ rail). ~l'I he ijisisted Upon accom-
panying ute, and all I coul(l say or (10 woul4 not dis-

~saw, by a brilliant flash of the lightning, a man st'and-
ing under one of the trees, not far from the grove.
My companion als saw him, and we 1)0th thought it
btralge that lie shoul I be there during such a violent
storm. As we came up to him, I sai(l, 'Friend, what
are you doing here during such a fearful storm? If
you have no way of' going 'home, ,jnmp up here behind
me and I wPl take you.'
"'Thank you, but don't mind me,' was the brief
reply.
"Wheit lie spoke, I exclaimed, in astonishment:
'Wh~y, Paul, are you here?' for I instantly recognized
hie voice. ~fIe said nothing, but another vivid flash
sbo~ved him to me as plainly as I ever saw him ifi my
life. 'You'll be drowned,' I co~tinuecl, 'if you stay
out here much longer: you had better come with me.'
'No, no; the roads are too heavy for any animal to
carry two, and, besides, I can shorten the distance by

then offered him hisT horse, as he had much further
to waIk~han himself. This offer lie also refused, tell-~

hand to him. He then begged us to go on ax4d not to

tarry in the rain on his account, an~l that he would
soon be at home himself'. ILbere insisted upon Andrew 's
returning home, and I took my way to Merry hail,
caving the prisoner where we had found him.~~
Andrew grew's evidence was the same as this given
here, and his ended the examination of' witnesses. I
don't know how to describe my feelings whilst th9
jury ~vas forming the verdict. I must have been sus-
tained by excitement, for I was wild with apprehen-
sign. At last the jury entered, and to the question-
"Guilty or Not Guilty?" "Guilty!" ~yas the answer,
and for a while I lost consciousness. -As I returned
to my senses, the awful sentence of death by hanging
was being pronounced upon the prisoner.
And was this all my glory and all my pride-the
looming gibbet? Indeed, I was truly an old man now.
Au! never, never wOuld I look upon this world again
with its joys and its casures, for my heart wag in the
lonely cell with the lo ely prisoner, and would follow
liini wherever he went, en to the grave.
I asked Lord Leigh what my poor boy said ~vhen
asked whSr the sentence of death should not be pro-
nounced against him. He answered thQat his appeal
was short, simple and touching, and that he had taken
it down in his note book, and~handed it to me. II will
insert it here:
"My friends, if such you will permit me to call you
after having heard me, like Cain, branded as a mur-
(lerer, I protest here, in the presence of my Divine
Maker, that I am innocent of' so dreadful ~ crime.

would no~ most willingly give my life to see hiyi. back

in tribute to my memory, but when that dried all remem~
branches would float away as the sea ~vinding~ on to the
distant ocean. But for him, whom the reaper spared
not in his spring time, but cut away, as the harvester
does his golden grain, unmindful of the flowers, there
weeps a grief-stricken mother, who rafts her heaving
sighs to the 'sepulchre by the s&amp;a,' where, clasped in
the arms of the still visitor, sleeps he~ first and only
born, his fair hair cov&amp;~d over by the death dews.
Her\ heart has been a fearful wreck since his young
life blood ebbed and flowed and sprinkled the green
turf beneath the dark grove on the inoorland. There
is a father, too, who has grown oki since the eyes of his
darling were closed forever, and lie mourns for the day
that will never return, when he heard those lips, now
cold and bloodless and hushed in death, calling his
name. Ah! again I sa~r that i[ would give my life to
redeem his. O1~! my friends, this is a sad ordeal.
There was, truly, a sorro~v that was robbing my life of

HIE night was cold and raw, and the driz-
zling rm came down slow and penetrating,
Causing the unlucky ones who were exposed
t-o it to shake and shiver. It fell noise-
lessly upon the roofs of the houses in the great city
of London. My own heart was as cheerless as this
direary night as I rang the bell at theldoor of my old
friend the duke whom I introduced to you at Gordon
Lodge in the'summer of 13-, when Paul was b)ut a
little boy. 1 had met him frequently since and had
long' numiber~ed him among my warmest and most inti-
mate friends. Nor had he forgotten the child whose
curly head he had stroked, on that summer's evening
many years ago, and who had won his way to the
old man's. heart and was still tenderly cherished
there. My summons was answered by a grey-headed
butler, who ushered me into a warm, comfortable
drawing-room, where brilliant lights formed a strange
contrast to the gloom without and to the dreariness
of my weary, worn heart. I had not long to wait
when the door opened and the old duke entered, lie
grasped my hand warmly without speaking, and we
seated ourselves. in silence. After a pause of a few
moments he spoke to me, saying:
" This is a said meeting truly, my dear friend. You
lhave had my deepest sympathy throughou tthe whole
of this sad affair, and I 'im the more dee ly grieved

"Then you really believe t1i~it he is innocent after

"Ali ! "I sighed, "when I thi~ik of him in his lonely

"That is my business here now, and, niy dear friend,

"With all my heart! with all my heart!" was the
Jiind reply. "I feel that I cannot do too much for this
young friend of mine, and I am entirely at, your ser~
vice. The sentence is to be put into execution on the
2&amp;th of November, isn't it?"
"Ani this is-"

"Yes~ I have known him for some time."
"Sufficiently to have formed an estimate of his
character?"
"No," hesitatingly, "l)tit I don't think I am very
mitch 1repossesscd in his favor."
The duke looked into 4he fire musino'I
moments, but did not pursue the subject, and shortly
afterwards I arose to take my departure. The kind
ge atleman insisted upon my remaining and partaking
of his hospitality. I thanked hi~n warmly, but said
'%hat I must go back to my hotel, where rooms were
pt'epared for me2 I then bade him good night and
walked out, feehin~ easier in mind than I had yet done
in those weary days of anxiety and care.
As I entered the public room of the hotel my atteti~
tion was arrested by the mention of Paul's name, made
by one of a group of j~'oung men, who were sitting
somewhat apart from the crowd smoking. lie was
saying:

don't believe lie is guilty, although I know the evidence
is enough to condemn St. Peter were he placed in a
similar position."
"I am sure of his innocence, too,'~ added a second,
taking a cigar from his mouth and puffing the smoke
into the air. " I knew SteWart at college, and he was
the finest fellow there; but that Gordon, ~ fellow,
was as weak as a girl. I f~e1 sorry for him noW that
he is dead and gone, but I never liked him much while

"Well, here," sai(1 1 t1iir(~, "is a health, to Stewart,
and that ~hc may soon be mit of that gloomy prison
back in his 01(1 place amongst us," and lie drank off a
glass of champagiie.
.1 here went to my room, thinking of the old duke's
remark "The numbers are multiplied who believe in
his innocence," and I lay down much comforted in
mind and slept until morning.
I staid but as short a time as II possibly could in
London, but did not leave until the reprieve was
granted and signed with the royal seal. It then turned
my face homeward with the duke as my companion,
thanking God in my inmost soul for His goodness in
thus granting mc a longer time to think and to act.
The locomotive whistled. loud and clear on the still
autumn air as we took our seats for the town of 13-~---.
The ride seemed long and wearisome to me, for II was
most anxious to he at home, and I was delighted when
the train at last stopped and we got off on the plat~

"No~ no, I am not tired, and am most anxious to
see my young friend."
"To the prison, driver," he called, without waiting
for me to give the order.
I sat back in the carriage with my heart overflowing
with gratitude to this good-old man, who seemed never
to weary in doing good. When we reached the pris.-
oner's cell, we found Paul sitting by a small deal table,
on which burned a solitary lamp. lie was reading
with his elbow resting on the table. The noise of our
entrance roused him, and he came forward with both
hands extended. I took him in my arms and pressed
him to my heart, and noticed a smile of gratitude light
up his face. And when the duke caught him by both
hands and wrung them warmly, tears filled his eyes.
"My son," lie said, "I pledge to you my belief in
your perfect innocence, and Ii have come here with the
express purpose of seeing you and telling you this."

LIE days were fast rolling on, and still no

~ lag to Geraldine's. I entered the quiet
ittic hail and rapp  gently at her cham~
ber door. Amy opened it for me; whispering
"speak softly," and instead of inviting mc in, came
out into the passage and closed the door noiselessly
behind her. We then walked to the little green par~
br, and sitting on the sofa beside me, she to! dmethat
her mother had been very sick ever since the day that
Paul had 1)ecn convicted.
"Dr. Arnold has told me not to be too confident ~f
her recovery, and to keep her very qui~t. And this
morning papa came to me with a proposal of marriage
from Godfrey Laughton, which, of course, I refused.
This enraged papa, but I was firm and determined.
Papa then said that I should obey him."
"II marry Godfrey Laughton!" she continued, with
the old fire flashing in her eyes. "Never! never! and
I told papa so."
The excitement soon ended and the soft loo~ came
back into her face as she told me "that it all resulted
in m~Udng her poor mother much worse."
After I l~ad delivered Paul's message, she asked me'
"II' she could not ~o sometimes to see him?" iI~ told
her "yes; that I would consider it, and perhaps obtain
her permission to do so,"

Do, do," she said, "for I must see hint But there
is Godfrey Laughton," she broke off suddenly, "What
must I do with him? Oh! don't leave me, uncle,"
catching me by the sleeve and holding me besid~ her
on the sofa.
He entered in the same bland manner that was usual
with hiip~, offering each of us his hand in turn. As II
did not give way to him, he made his visit very short.
When he was about leaving, he asl~e~~ Amy if he might
call the following evening and see her alone?
"Mr. J~augliton," she answered, coldly, "there is no
time I can call my own since my mother's illness. My
mornings and my evenings arc employed in attendar cc
on her."
"I am sorry to hear this, but ye~ do not despair ~if
seeing you," and, bowing gracefully, lie left us.
We did not speak after he was gone,. but watched
his i~etreating figure.
"My mistress wishes to see Mr. Meredith," said old
Nellie, putting her head in at the door.
"Go and comfort her, and try to make her troubled
mind easier," whispered Amy at her mother's room,
whilst she passed out into thd autumn sunshine to
refresh her drooping spirits.
Geraldine held out her wasted hand to me as
entered her chamber.
"I am so glad you have come, John. I have wanted
to see you fur a long time."
I sat down 1)y her bedside and looked upon that
gentle face of which 31 was so {bnd. Tho blue veins
were distinct and clear now upon the white forehead,

251

there were large circles under the pale blue eyes, and
bright feverish spots burned upon each cheek. I passed
~ my hand over the smooth, warm forehead, and asked
if she felt better,
"No, I will never feel better again here, John, and
the next autumn leaves will fall upon my narrow be ,
for I will not linger much longer in this valley of' tears.
You have been a kind, good friend to me, and my hap-
piness for m~ny years has proceeded from your friend-
ship. Ii will leave this world with but little regret,
my only one being that my poor child will be left
behind, and I would wish to live to see Paul's inno-
cence declared, for I know it must be some day, and
you will live to see it. There is otfe thing, John, I
want to beg you to promise me, and it is after I am
gone, not to let my poor Amy marry Godfrey Laugh..
ton. Will you stand by he5 and shelter and protect
her?" She leaned upon her elbow and looked steadily
into my eyes.
"I will," I answcre(l firmly.
"Then God be blessed! for now I will die happily."
here were two children bequeathed to me by their
dying ni6t~ers, and I felt that my responsibility was
growing heavy and heavier as I sat still gazing upon
that gentle face, with its closed eyes and sharp, marked
outlines, and knew that a martyr's crown would soon
rest upon those soft tresses in a better land.
In the evening when I left her I walked down
towards the sea. When I came within a short dis-

the ground very near it,' almost' in it, evidently in
search of something. He saw me coming, and walked
rapidly away, but~ I was not mistaken in that graceful
carriage, and wondered what Godfrey Laughton was
looking for there.

'~ EVI~N months had passed in quick suc-
cession, carrying with them the autumn
~\~JJ frosts and the winter snows; and,~J
L~J stood on the piazza at Gordon, a great bee
huzzed by me, giving the cheery announcement that
spring had come; while out on the lawx~, swarms of
small flies were commencing to take wing and light
upon the nearest bud or flower. The jonquills, hya-
cinths, violets, and Easter flowers were all in bloom,
and scenting the air with their fragrant breath; the
lawn looked like a smooth green carpet, ornamented
here and there by a glistening dew-drop, the birds
were twittering and caroling, and all nature seemed
alive with joy.
Eleanor and Lord Gordon had not been at the
Lodge for many months. When Eleanor was able to
travel, they had taken her away to Italian skies, to
bring the roses back to her cheeks; they had not yet
returned, and in all probability would not during the
summer. There was still no clue to the murderer, and
the reprieve would expire in June. The Duke had
written to iIIC that he thought he could have it extended
if' necessary, but still I was very miserable, thinking
of poor Paul wasting his young life away in a gloomy
Prison. The air was so balmy and 'soft this spring'
morning, that I took my chair out on the balcony. I
had not been there very long, when I saw Geraldine's

and as IF went into the 5ick room, 111 saw that ~a great
change had taken place in the invalid. 111cr face had
sunken,, and the dews of' death were fast gathering on
her brow. She recognized me as I. walked to her bed,
and a faint smile played 'o\.~cr her features for an
instant. Amy waS holding i~er hand in hers, counting
the feeble, flickering pulse, and in every lineaflielit of'
her young face was depicted despair. I leaned over
the dying mother, and heard her praying softly,
'invoking blessings upon her child, with whose name
she coupled mine and Paul's. She would then make
God to
an appeal for her erring husband, calling upon
be merciful to him, and bring him to Himself, and
then relapse into asking ~lessings for Amy.
I lifted the disengaged hand which lay upon the
coverlid, and felt that the pulse was growing fainter
and sloWer, and rapidly ebbing away. I could hardly
feel sorry that she was going, for her life had been so
full of anguish and of care, and TiOW her spirit 'would
soon be peaceful and at rest by her Illeavelily Father's
side; but for Amy, my heart bled, as she' 'sat notion
less, n~t daring to speak for fear she would snap the
cord- that bound her loved mother to earth. Geraldine
spoke:

"Amy, my darling, are you near me?"
Yes, in other, (10 ~OU want anything'?"
"Nothing, dearest, only to die in your arms."
~ placed her head upon the breast of her daughter,
Who lovingly twined her arms aroun(l her. I don't
know w1)ere Captain Wayland was; 01(1 Nellie had
sought for him, but he. could not be found. I was
very anxious that he should come in time, hoping that
when he saw his gentlewife leaving him forever, that
his hard heart might be touched at last. I knew that
11 would miss very much her soft smiles, her endur-
ing, patient look, and her poor, pale face, and I sighed
to think what a blank she would leave in my life.
?Uhe (lay passed on, but we did not relinquish our
seats ; everything was Still and quiet in that death-
chamber. The breath of the flowers stole softly in at
the open windows, whilst n&amp;tes from the forest warb-
hers struck upon our ears in sweet and musical tones.
And the little clock orr the mantle ticked away its
aceonds, its minutes, and its hours. Slower and slower
beat that heart which was bowed down with its weight
of care, fainter afl(l fainter throbbed the pulse, and
shorter a'nd shorter grew the breath, and with a smile
that was sweet anti heavenly,, the spirit took its flight.
II removed her from the arms of her child, and closed
the blue eyes, clasped thQ . '!endcr fingers over the
breast, smoothed the fair hair on the marble brow, and
kissed, for the last time, hcr cold lips. There was a

of her truest and best friend, who would soon be con~
signed to the lap of earth. I rubbed Amy's temples
with cologne water, as she lay pale and~ 5tiIl. I then
left her and walked front room to room in that little
cottage, where IL had seen the poor mother's patient
fade, and heard her kind Voice so often in the last
twelve years. We buried her the following evening
in the quiet graveyard on a little knoll that looked
~\~Tards the sea.
The southern sun kissed the green mound as it rQ$e
from the calm waters, and the gentle dews sprinkled
the turf; and called into life the violets and' the roses.
Not long after, a little white tombstone rose in that
churchyard, simply bearing her name, and around
which the myrtle and the ivy twined caressingly.
"Re qu~icscat im pace," II murmured, as I cast a fond
look at her last resting-place, and left the spot.

myself; old Patrick being my only compan-
ion, and now that poor Geraldine was no
more, there was little for me to think about
but my trials, and how to prove Paufs innocence. Amy
was more resigned, and her father much kinder, not
urging her any more to her marriage with Godfrey,
nor had he mentioned it since his wThe's death.
I was feeling so lonely and wretched one evening
that I determined to walk back to the cottage, though I
had been there in* the morning. It was rather late
when I left the Lodge, and the moon was peeping up
from the sea as I neared the cottage. Xs I opened the
white gate and entered, Amy'~ sweet voice fell upon
my ear, singing a ballad from Longfellow; she had
reach LA the second verse, and I heard:
"My life is cold, and dark, and dreary,
It rains, and the wind is never weary,
My thoughts still clii~g to the mouldering past,
And the hopes of my youth fall thick in the bla:t,
Eor the day is dark and dreary."

She then told me that Godfrey Laughton had been

and that very shortly.
"I told him," said the brave girl, "that I would.

sitting-room together. I did not wish to return to the
subject again, so I took my chair near The marble
centre table, and* commenced turning 'over some pic~

"You hear from them occasionally, don't you,
"Yes, through Lord Gordon, though his hearth too
is very delicate. His last letter with ~regard to poor
Eleanor was not vgry cheering, lie' said her spirits
were still very low and melancholy and nothing seemed
to revive her."
We had now reached the tenant's (loor, ~vliich was
opened by a chubby boy with red cheeks, red hair, and
red hands. And to Amy's inquiry "How Was his
mother?" said, "He~ didn't know how his mother was;
to ask her."
We went ~to the sick woman's bedside and found her
in a very restless slumber. She presently opeiwd her
eyes and recognized us.
"Oh! is it you, Mr. Meredith and Miss Amy?"
she asked, and her eyes closed again from sheer
exhaustion.
We raised her head and poured a stimulant into her
mouth, which sli~~al1owed with difficulty. She then
turned her face~ to m'~ and said, in a weak voice:
"Mr. Meredith, it may be, of some use to you: God~
frey Laughton passed my house at twelve o'clock at
night onTh 19th of August, 18-."
"In what direction?~~ I asked, l)reathless]y; but she
ti~irned her face to the wall and nevei4 spoke again.

OR~ RETRIBUTION.

I was stupified. Why had this woman sent for me
to give me with her dying breath a piece of information
which might turn the whole tide of affairs and bring
my boy back into my arms once more? Perhaps this
was the only evidence we could get, but now she was
no more, and there was no one left to speak in the cap-
tive's cause.
"Was there no other grown person about the house
on tliat~i ght?" I enquired.
"No, there was no other there, the husband being
absent."
Then all was as blank as ever, and when the neigh-
bors came in to perform their duty to the dead, we
arose and took our departure.
The sun was making a faint effort to shine as we
passed out, but, the glare was sickly and dim. 'We
walked on for some time in ~ilence, occupied with our
own thoughts. The dark grove was but a short dis-
tance in front of us no~v, casting its black shadows
around, and looking gloomier than ever. One pale ray
of the November sun was peeping through the opening
the lightning had made on that dreadful night in
August. It was an ill-shaped spot the ray formed,
but it was bright and shining in contrast to the dark-
ness of the rest of the scene. We both stood gazing
on this particular place, where the body of the dead
boy had laid. There was no mark left of that tragedy.
The ground had long since drunk up the crimson blood
which had watered the grass, and nothing now re-
mained. Amy walked a few steps in front of me, and
to my surprise entered the grove. She stooped down,

and, on the place where the sunbeam played, picked up
something.
"What is it, Amy?" IL asked, hurriedly, but she
walked rapidly on, as if to pass the dreary spot before
answering me. She then turned and held towards me
a small piece of jewelry, saying:
"Did ~Paui ever have anything like this?"
It was a small watch-trinket in the shape of a gaiter,
with nine buttons composed of very fine brilliant. I
examined it very closely, and did not recognize it. I
felt sure that I had never seen i~ before. In answer to
her inquiry, I said:
"Give' it to ~ne, child, and say nothing about it, ~r
I must find out whom it belongs to."
We walked on then, both dreading to say anythix g,
and fearing to hope. I knew by the tarnish on the
little jewel that it must liav~ been out some time. I
took it with me to the Lodge and locked it. carefully in
my secretary, waiting until the next day before I
proceeded further, for it was now late. My mind was
so alive with this new hope that II slept very little dur-
ing the night and rose bright and early the next morn-
ing. II pushed back my window curtain, and there
before mc was a white carpet, for it had snowed during
the night as it can only snow in Merry England. The
snow was still softly falling; the large fleecy flakes were
comiffg down in myriads, gently and slowly. It had
fallen on the tree tops, dressing the bare branches with
a robe of virgin white, even the dark grove wearing a
dress. of spotlc~s purity, and over the dreary moorland
was a pure, smooth carpet, ~n~roken by a foot-print.

OR~ T~F4TRlBIJTION.

I stood there some time watching it, and thinking of
the little trinket, when Patrick's head, rivaling the
scene without in whiteness, peeped in, exclaiming:
"Why, are you ~up, master? I thought to wake
you, but here you are dressed."
"Yes, up and dressed. Any mail, Patrick 'h"'
"Yes, a note and a letter."
"A. note! From whom 9"
"Dr. Arnold's servant gave it Lo me and told mc to
give it to you immediately."
I broke the note open hastily. lit ran as follows:
DEAR Fz~zEND:
I am at the sick bed of Godfrey Laughton, and wish you to
come here immediately, for strange things may be revealed.
Yours in haste,
T. J. ARNOLD.
I read the letter, which w~s from the old duke. It
was full of kindness and sympathy~ , and trusting that
we might still do something to liberate the prisoner.
I was very much surprised when my eyes fell upon
th ~se words in the letter:
Yesterday, as I was passing by an artist's gallery, I entered
to examine the pictures, and I was very much surprised to see a
small oil painting of that very pretty girl, Miss ~Vayland, to whom
you introduced me the last time I visited you. The picture is a
very true and a very lovely one, and 'the ~costume it is taken in
exceedingly bec~ning. The artist told me it was in the posses-
sion of Mr. God~yLa~g1~ton, who wished to have it remodeled.
I-Low did this l)icttlre come into (xodfrey Laughtou'~
possession? I wondered, for I knew it was not the one
at the cottage, for that IL had seen but an evening or
Lwo before. It must have been the one Captain Way-.

IanJ gave Gerald, and how did Godfrey Laughton get
it? I thought of this and much moro as I rode to his
house. I was not long in arriving at my journey's
cn~, and never was Merry Hall so quiet 'as it was this
morniPg. The servants walked about noiselessly and
spoke in whispers, and it altogether appeared very sol-
cain. The butler took me into a warm sitting ro@m,
where a blazing fire burned in the grate, casting out a
ruddy glow and making the apartment very comfort~
- ble. I asked for the doctor, and, taking a chair, sat
looking into the red coals, wondering what the result
of' my visit here would be.
"A bitter cold morning, Meredith," said the doctor,
coming in rubbing his hands. "How did you navigate',
through the snow? You didn't meet with an avalanche,
did you?
"Oh, no. I got on pretty well. How a~e you feel-.
ing to-day, doctor?"
"So-.so,'~ and drawing a chair up to the fire, 'he
motioned me to come near to him.
I seated myself very 'cldse, and ,he leaned forward
and commenced:
"Meredith, it has all been as I expected. I am an
old man, and experience has given me much penetra-
tion, but I did not wish to hang a man on my suspi-.
dons merely and without some positive proof; but I
have that no~v. The wild delirium made him tell '~a
tale which was fearful, fearful. Could you have heard
what I did through the still hours of the night the
blood in your veins would have been frozen. It was
he,"~pointing to the room above where the invalid was,
"who severed the soul from the body under the firs."

OR, RETRIBUTION.

265

I sprang to my feet and caught his arm.
"Doctor!"
"Be quiet, friend, 1)0 quiet. Much depends on our
being calm."
~lie then motioned me to follow him, and led me up
stairs into the patient's room. it was an elegantly fur-.
nished apartment, comfortable and luxurious, where
not a breath of the winter wind dare enter; but Ii
thought little of this as I approached the bed where
lay the sick man, tossing restlessly, and unconscious.
His handsome face was covem~ed over with a scarlet
mantle of fevcr and his eyes were wild and glaring.
The doctor motioned me to a seat at the head of the bed
and he took one on the opposite side. The invalid was
muttering to himself; but I could not understand what
he was saying, though I bent over and listened atten-.
tively. I waited a long time~and had grown very
tired. I raised myself up at last, thinking it was no
use and that my kind friend snust have been mistaken,
but he nodded to mc, and I resumed my former posi-.
tion. I had scarcely done so when I caught Gerald's
name and "Those glaring eyes, why don't they "---then
something followed that I could not understand, then
some disconnected sentences were muttered like these:
"Blood stop flowing." "Little gaiter somewhere
there." "Blood' on picture and it wdn't wash out."'
"I'd kill a dozen to marry "-. "The gibbet Will rid
me of"-.
I waited lono~ but could catch no more. But I had
hear(1 enough.

"Will that confirm what I have told you," said the
doctor, stooping over, and looking inc in the eye.
I bowed my head and sat silent some time. The
picture he spoke of must have been the one of Amy's
that Gerald had, and the little gaiter the one she had
found under the firs. As. I thought of this I remem-
bered that I had seen him hunting for something there
some months ~before, and was struck at the time with
the strangeness of the proceeding.
I went with all haste back to the Lodge and dis-
patched to the duke to havethe picture of Amy exam-
ined to see if there were any signs of blood upoi~ it.
I soon received a return telegram, saying the picture
had be~n examined, kit that there were no marks upon
it. I was very much depressed at this and quite in a
state of bewilderment, for if there were no trace of blood
upon the picture, what right had we to pay attention
to anything The sick man had said'? The only thing
that was left to cheer mc now was thd shoe, for he had
spoken of that too in his delirium; but then I thought
he might have ped that at any other time. All
my hopes seeI~ain blighted, and we could only
wait now until ~~~ick man recovered and see what
steps we should take next. I was fully convinced, as
was also Dr. Arnold, that~ Godfrey Laughton was the
guilty one.
Old Patrick brought up my tea to my room that
evening, for he used to sit with inc now, and. I was
never weary of his companionship. I sat down to take
a mouthful of the tea and a little toast, when. the loud
ring of the doQr-bell quite startled ~me, for this was

something new in our quict lives at the Lodge, where
we never had visitors in the winter evenings.
"Who is it, PatrieF ?"
"I will go and see; "~but scarcely had he reached thq
(loor when a servant entered and handed mc a card.
Iwas very much surprised to see the 01(1 duke's name
upon it, and went down to the drawing-room where I
found him warming his han(ls. There was another
gentleman ~it1i him, to whom lie introduced inc as I
enterc(1. After a few common-place remarks, the duke

I was very much excited, and I went immediately and
had the picture examined, which did not result in any
discovery. When I returned to my room I could not.

time with more success. IL had a very strong magni-
fying glass with which I bad it examined, closely, and
weTound a spot upon it, which, upon b~ing analyzed,

me," he continued, walking to a table and taking it
from a portfolio, and handing it to me.
I took it to the brilliant gaslight, but failed to det~~t
the spot upoii it.
"I see you (10 not perceive ~ said the duke, "nor
could I at first." lie then pointed to one of the cor-
ncrsr where I saw for the first time a very tiny, faint
spot, which many careful ablutions had ~almost oblit-

"Are you con~ineed ~f the nature of the stain?"
spoke the (luke, l)reflkillg my reverie, "It was some
time before II ii~ys~1f WiIS convinced, and if you have
any doubts, this g'entlemnu here will soon remove theI8
on that score."
T1~e gentleman alluded to bowed and was soon at
work mixing his chemicals, which he shortly after
applied to the spot,. and I w'~ s no longer doubtful. I
uttered a thanksgiving to God for his ~nercy.
Now," said the duke,~ time after, when the
chemist had retired, " how did this painting come into
Godfrey Laughton's hands and how did the drop of
blood come upon it? You have told me there were
but two of this kind, one given to theyoung heir of
Gordon and the other in Miss Wayland's own l)OSSCS~
sion.
- "Yes," I answered, " and this is certainly the one
that was given to Gerald."
"Are you sure that Miss Wayland did not give the
other to this Laughto  herself? ~'
"As certain as I am that I am a living man, awl
to-morrow I shall prove it to you."
We retired then for the night. The next morning,
very early, I had the close carriage ordered and went
'to the cottag~ for Amy. I told her my errand as soon
as I arrived, and she made all possible haste to accom-
pany Inc to the Lodge. We brought with us the other
painting of Amy. I had just helped her into the car-
riage, and was getting into it myself; when young Lor(l

I had introduced Amy into the sitting~rOOm where the
duke was, I drew Lord Leigh apart and. told him what
had passed. Whilst Ii spoke his eyes sparkled, and he
seemed all eagerness to begin with the evidence we had
to clear the prisoner. I then told the duke that we
had better commence at once to take down the notes,
as Lord Leigh's time w~s 'limited.
I went up stairs for the picture which the duke had
brought, and which I had put into my secretary the
night before. 4s I took it from its resting~plaeC, I
drew with it the little gold shoe. II hastily picked it
up and went down stairs with it in my hand. When
I went into the room. the company gathered around
me. I handed the picture to the duke, who gave it to
Amy, sayiiig:
"Do you recognize this?"
"Of course I do, my Lord," said the girl, inno-
cently. "This is one of two pictures that was painted
for me in July, 18~."
"Well, how did you dispose of this one?" he
asked.
"IL did not dispose of it myself. My fatheV gave it
to Gerald, heir of Gordon, shortlyy after it was taken."
* "But, my child," said the old man, "could yo~m
swear that this was the one?"
"Yes," she returned, "there were only two
and she walked to the pia1~o, where her muff and gloves
lay, and brought the corresponding picture.
The duke took the two pktures in his hands.
Bes~des~" said Amy, "there was another ~mark or
two by which I would know the one that papa gave
away from mine, There was a scratch across the neck,

made by xnammas shawl-pin, which ma:~;:Â±~ thought
disfigured it greatly, and she was glad it was that one
that papa gave to Gerald."
We all looked eagerly at the picture and saw there
the scratch which she had described.
"And besides this mark, there were three Arabic
characters on the back of the canvass, Which Paul
painted in Indian ink one evening. I don't know
what they stand for, tliowrh," she continued.
We turned the j)icturc and looked at the back, and
there saw very plainly the three clmracters which she
had. told us of and we all felt now perfectly satisfied
as to the identity of the picture.
The duke then asked if there was anyone present
~vhen her father gave this away, and she answered:
"Yes, Mr. Laughton."
He then looked at me significantly and I returned
his glance. I raised up from the table on which I had
been leaning, and, in doing so, knocked the little trin~
ket to the floor. Lord Leigh stooped and picked it
up. lie looked ~t it long and curiously.
"My Lord," I asked, whilst my heart l)alPitated
very rapidly, "(lid you ever sce that before?"
"Yes, Nir. Meredith."
" Where, my Lord ?"
"On Godfrcy La'~ghton's watch-chain. It was

for the worse; her eyes were wild and staring, and she scarcely
spoke to me; would eat nothing, and drove her maid from her
presence altogether. A friend called to see me, and I was obliged
to leave her for a little while. When I returned she was absent,
and when I enquired of the servants if they knew where their
mistress was, their answers were a I in the negative. I could not
gain the slightest information from any one. I have searche~i

hei soft, fair hair by the handfuls and scratch ed her~
smooth, transparent skin until it was terribly disfig-
ured. Lord Gordoji came early the next morning, but
she was as unconscious of his presence as she was of
mine.. He wished to take her to the Lodge, but the
(loctor persuaded him to let her remain.
(hi the following Monday week II was again seated
in the court-room, but under very different circumsta~-
ces fre'~i the time that I was there before. I was a
witness against the prisoner at the bar, who was God-
frey Laughton. The mo~t of the evidence against him
you have heard; but the most convincing was that of
two women from the Hall, one of them the, nurse dur-
ing the prisoner's illness and the other the assistant.
They had been compelled to go into his private ward-
robe for some linen whilst he was si~k and found there
a shirt and a, pair of linen pants, hidden' away under
some other things, which were stained with blood of
long standing. It was remembered by his servants
that he had w&amp;n a pair of pants that answered to the
description of these on the evening of the 19th of
August, 18-. The servant~ also gave evidence that
he was not at the Hall on that unhappy evening from
about six until one at iiight. The evidence against
him was very great and convincing, and the verdict
pronounced him "guilty."

HISTORY ANI) CONFESSION OF THE MURDERE[~.
WAS                       iMay, 18-,
born in Bin o'cn on the iltI
and was the third son of a large family. My
father was an honest, industrious mechanic,
and my motl~r pious and amiable. At an
early age I showed talent and vivacity and was con-
sidered remarkably handsome. My mother indulged
me very much. She was proud of my fair face and
graceful carriage, and made her other children succumb
to my every wish. We were very poor, and my two
older brothers had t~ toil for their daily bread. But
I was a little idler, who refused to do anything and was
never compelled.
"I remember, when I was about eleven years old,
my father Was employed building some frame stores
for a rich merchant, and would go to his ~vork very
early every morning and not return untjl late in the
evening. My mother called me to her one day and
asked me if I would take my father's dinner to him;
that all the other children were absent. I said, 'I
reckoned so,' and being tired of nothing to do, picked
up the basket that contained his meal and, went b
where he wa3 working. II was al~vays bland to stran~
gers, and as a general thing attracted them. When I
arrived at the place where my fa~hcr was, I found him
speaking to a handsomely-dressed gentleman. So,
wearing a most~winning smile, I bowed low and handed
my father his dinner. T~tk4~tranger eyed mc compla'..
gently, ~nd asked:

"' Is this your son?
"'Yes,' answered my father, feeling flattered that I
was thus noticed.
"'You are a fine little boy. have you ever been to
school ?' said the gentleman, patting me on the head.
No, sir.'
"'Would you like to go?' he asked.
'Ah ! indec(l that I would, sir, above all things,'
I answered.
" ' Why, Ibis is anhl)ition, an(l that's what I glory
in.
"Then turning to my father he said
'If you will let me have this boy of yours I will
educate him as a gentleman, and when he grows older
will give him a fine berth in my iuerca~tile estab~
"My father was so overpowered with gratitude and
delight that he could scarcely speak, anti stro.~ed my
fae~ most lovingly. The stranger then asked me:
'"how would you like that, my boy?'
"'Nothing would give me such pleasure; I would
lx: more than clclighted-.-and you are so very kind,'
kissing his hand.
"He s ~h1cd greatly pleased with mc, and told me
to go home now and tell my mother, and that he would
cotue for me on the morrow.
" I bade him adou, and ran all the way home, full
of the idea of LAng a gentleman. When I told my
mother she wcp~ very bitterly and said she eonld not
hear tc~ gi ye me up, calling me all the while the most
cn(learing names. I told her that she did not know

what was good for me, that it was all glo4ous, anJ
we;it to bed that night with visions of the future as
bright ~s sunbeams. I waked early next morning,
and foand. that my mother had staid up all night to
wash and arrange my scati ty wardrobe. As the day
advanced she kissed me again and again, and begged
God to bless me. When thp time of parting came, my
brothers bade me good-bye with tears in their honest
eyes, whilst mine remained nnnioistcned. My little
sister was perhaps the only one I j)arted from with aiiy
regret. She was so beautiful, and had been such a
willing, little slave to me, and I felt that I would miss
her very much. I bade her adieu with a tear which
was soon dried, and as the sun sank on 'fair Bingen,'
I left my paternal roof.
"The o~d gentleman took me kindly by the hand
when I wa~ telling my father good-bye, thinking that
I would fi~cl the parting, but the sorrow was all on
one side. 'Good-bye, Oscar, my son, good-bye; don't
forget your old father, my child, who loves you so
~bndly.' He kissed my cheeks whilst the big teats
fell fast upon them, but I ~was unmoved. The stranger
then put mc if~ his carriage, and shaking hands with
my ~arcnts jumped in after me. The last words I
ever heard my fatl~er say were: 'Oscar, my son, don't
forget me.'
"I was not at all abashed before the strange man,
ror I was neyer afraid of strangers, and talked a great
deal, which ~ecrned to please the gentleman, for he

leges, where I remained seven years. I was smart,
ambitious and brilliant, and stood first in all my
classes, and at eighteen was considered su~lciently
capable of faking my stand in the mercantile house.
M~ old patron was very kind to me, and seemed very
proud that I had succeeded so well. After my return
to Bingen, I was installed as head clerk in one of his
establishments. My kind friend was never weary of
serving my interests. I made myself as agreeable to
him as possible and feigned an unusual amount of
gratitude.
"One evening as I was pouring over some accounts,
my benefactor camein, and said:
4     "'Oscar ny boy, I bear you have not been to see
your fami~ yet; put up those books and go to them,~
boy.'
"I was ashamed to confess that it was pride that
had prevented me from visiting them, and made the
e: ceuse that it was 'press of business.'
"'Make tl~at an excuse no longer, Oscar, for I want
y~ji to pay a visit to them every day.'
"I was half angry at this, for I would rather not
have visited the scenes where I had once been a poor
carpenter's son. But 11 thanked the old man with
* well-assumed gratitude, and, shutting up my books,
walked out. I soon found myself in the narrow street
w here my mother dwlt.-~my Ihther having long since
died. I hesitated some time before I would enter this
humble dwelling where I was born, and where those
that should have been dearest to inc were living. I

my beautiful sister caused me to change 1)i~ mu~d, SO
I rapped at the door and it was opened to mc by the
lovck girl I had just wished kto see~ I did not at first
recognize her, nor she inc. I told her who I was, and
said, ' I wished to see i~v mother.'
"She threw her arms aroun(l my neck, and called
me her dear, dear brother, asking if I had conic back
to ~thera again after so long an ahsdice. II kissed her
rosy Iips~ and felt very proud of her, because she had
been true to her girlhood, and had grown into a lovely
woman. She then took me in to my mother, and said,
~ here, mother, is Oscar come back to us once more.'
Mv kind mother cried with delight when she found out
who I was, and pressed me to hbr heart repeatedly,
~hedding tears of joy. When my brothers came home
from work they both~ met me very affectionately, but
I inwardly shrank from them, for they were in their
working elo:he~, and I had a sinful pride as regarded
such thjn~;. When I arose to go, my mother pleaded
with me to remain with them d4~'ing the night. I

long afte+ this, but left the house vowing that an
estrangement should soon take place between. this
youi~g couple. Ii very soon after this introduced my
bosom friend to my family; he was on a Par with
myself; and was very soon enamored of my sister's
charms. I determined that she should marry him, but
she gave him no encour~geflieflt~ which enraged us
both. We ~nade up our minds to dispatch my friend's
rival as soon as possible. it was on a summer even-
ing that we had planned to meet him, as he was return-
ing from his work on the outskirts of the city, and it
was arranged that I shouh-l insult 'him, and a dud
w~uld ensue, in which I promised myself every advai ~-
t:ige. A demon urged me, and on I went. We m.t,
and in every possible way I provoked him. At fir~t,
he bore with mc very calmly, but at length his tempt r
was roused; and he took the pistol I proffered, ai~d sa~ ti
he would fight. I would not allow him time to call a
second, but made my companion measure the groun 1,
and we took OlTir stand, the signal was given and ~
fired, and my sister's affianced husband fell dead upon
the grass. The blue Rhine flowed inurmuringly along
as if to chide me for my evil deed, and. I fled from the
spot, my companion following me, without being either*
pursued or suspected. I never forgot the next evening
whcn II called at my mother's home. There lay my
sister cold and motionless, with a broken heart; she
never smiled again, nor spoke to any of us; she turned
from me instinctively as if she knew I was th~ cause
of all her sorrow, and three weeks from that day I
followed her to her home in the churchyard~ For a

time I felt a great grief; but it wore away at last. The
suspicions of the murder never rested upon me, but I
thought it would be better for me to be far away from
my native land. The spirits of the4wo beings I had
sent to an early grave were continually haunting me,
and I determined to leave-but how was I to accom-
push this without friends or money? At length, I
concluded to forge a check upon my bcnefactoi"s house.
I soon after put this dctei4Anation into execution, and
found myself in possession of fifty thousand pounds,
and on the evening of that same day, after passing the
churchyard to cast one more glance on tjie ~ravc of my
poor sister, I left the vine clad hills as the setting sun
was bathing them in a rosy twilight forever. I
assumed a disguise that was so complete, that I was
never recognized. After a time, I went over into Ire-
land, where I became acquainted with Captain Way-

all seemed to be going on well, when Amy Wayland
arrived from Paris. I had never loved in all my
life, but she was so winning, so lovely, and so gentle,
that I soon became captive to her womanly graces and
charms; her image was constantly before me, and I
loved her wildly and passionately. When I heard she
was betrothed to Paul Stewart, I became 'almost fran-.

'iic, and the night of Lady Grantly's ball, I heard the
coiwersation between hini and Amy, and bit my lips
until the blood flowed. (I loved her so, that I would
not bring her name before the public court, although
I knew it was she to whom Paul was speaking~-I pre~
ferred perjuring myself.) I also heard tim converse~
tion between Lady Gordon and Captain WTayland the
same ni~ht and I knew this wa3 the stronger party,
and was the one to fear. I was confident, though, that
Amy loved Paul ,~so I r~solvcd then and there to get
/ ri~l of my two rivals. I never liked Gerald Gordon-
poor, weak hoy-but now I hated him, as I thought
he would be successful. I liked Stewart infinitely
better, but I consigned him to a far worse fate, think-
ing that Amy would cease to love him when she heard
him branded as a felon. You all know ~vhen the
engagement between Gerald and Amy was made pub--
lie.  'sowed theii to murder hun and bring evidence
/ so roiig against Paul Stewart that he would be
indicted. The night of the 19th of August came at
Â£    la~t, the next sun would shine upon the marriage day,
ai~d thiS was my last chance for action; now, how was
I to commit the deed without being suspected myself?
I ~iad been thinking about it for a whole week. You
all~ remember that in my evidence I told you that I
4bund Paul Stewart standing beneath one of the trees
snot far from the grove on that night. II knew he was
'niourning over luis~sad fate, and that in 'his heart there
raged a tempest as 'fearful as the one in which l~~tood.
lie did not mind the pelting rain, the mutt6rin~j~hiin
der, or the y1y~d lightning, they accorded but too well

with his own feelings; but my heart palpitated wildly
when I saw him. It knew that Gerald Gordon had
not returned from 13 , for I had made all enqui-
vies. So, after bidding IDrew good night, under the
j)retence of hastening home, I passed across the lower
end of the moorland, tied my horse in a thicket
beyond, an(l hurried back, but here I met with an
obstruction; i[ was obliged to pass by Mrs. carr's
cabin, the door was open and a stream of light fell in.
my path; the woman was at the door, and her keen
eye recognizing me, she asked me where I was going
in such a storm.
"I walked rapidly on without answering, hoping
that she would imagine herself mistaken. I first went
to the spot where 'I[ had left Paul Stewart, and, to my
satisfaction, found him gone. I then entered the grove-
of firs, and did not have to wait very long until It heard
Gerald Gordon's horse coming towards me. I call
up all my courage here. His horse, generally so rest-
I
we and fiery, was as tractable as a lamb. I caught it
by th~ bridle as it came up to me, and threw it back
on its haunches. A demon's strength was in my arms.
I then jerked the rider from. its back. lie struggled
manfully, bY~t I struck' him a blow on his head with
my pistol, which stunned him. I pulled him some
distancee into the grove. He then returned to con-
sciousness and asked, 'Who wiShes to kill me?' and by
a lightning flash saw my fkce, and said, 'Is it you,
Godfrey?' I coAwd my pistol. lie here begged, for
J)ity sake, to l2!~ him pray one moment for mercy. He

sake, don't kill me.' I pointed my pistol and as he
cried 'Lord have mercy' I~ fired, and he fell upon the
grass. I then searched in one pocket for the picture
of Amy Waylaud, which I had seen him have that
very morning, and which he showed mq on his way to
town, and irritated mc by asking 'if I would not like
to haxre it.~ It was the only thing he possessed that I
~coveted, for when I could not have Amy with me, II
\iust have this representation of her. So I quickly
concealed it in my pocket, and ran in the direction of
i~iy horse, which I woon mounted, and hastened to the
hal 1. 1 put the. horse away myself; for fear of detec-
tion. I[ then opened the Hall door with a night-hey,
and went softly up to my chamber. There was my
roon~ alt prepared by the careful servants; the lamp
was lighted; the curtains all drawn to. I doubly
locked the door when I entered. I looked at my
clothes; they were stained with' blood. It drew them
off hui~icdly, wrapped them np, and put them in a
wardrobe which no one entered but myself~ The paint-
ing I also hid. I then washed my hands again and
again~and took a bath inmy bath-room, and threw out
the water myself; so that none would be the wiser. I
could ~not sleep that night, for I eduld see, the dead boy's
face peering at mc from every corner of the room. N
was afraid to look in any direction. I' shut my eyes,
but it was all the same. L dared not walk up and
down my chamber floor, for the very sound of my foot-
steps ~Vere like echoes from the tomb, and in every
shadow cast upon the ceilings or wall I could see iih~
murdered boy's dying eyes, and every sigh of the nig~4~~

wind seemed to bear upon its breath his' last, words.
As the dawn began to break, I sought my bed to avoid
suspicion, and I parried it for a long time. I was very
much alarmed when I found my little watch-trinket
was gone, for I knew it must have fallen that night
near the grove, and this kept mc in a wretched state of
suspense fQr many days. But as time passed away I
thought less of it, though I hunted for it frequently.
The stain of blood on the picture annoyed me un'ceas-
ingly. II washed it and washed it until I thought it
had disappeared altogether. I was so crazy to have it
remodeled that I sent it to London, and you all know
the consequences. And the few remaining items of my
life you are also acquainted with. I have been a wicked
man, but my retribution will be very great. Amy
Wayland's image has lived with inc and will go with
me down to the grave. I dare not ask for pity, for It
know you have none to give; but did I know that only
one tear would fall for me, It would die happier."
This ended the history and the confession, and when
we read it, we did not refuse him the tears he sighed
for.

CONCLUSION.

JIE following June, at the little country
church, . as the evening sunbeams stole in
through the window~,, casting their bright'c
rays on the altar and the pictures, two bridal
couples entei'ed-and handsomer couples could not be
found in all Er~gland. I am sure it ~vill not be hard
for my reader to guess who they were. The first th~xt
knelt and received the blessing of thq old priest was
Lord Leigh and, hi~" airy, fairy Lillian," whb looked
lovelier than ever i&amp;her bridal r&amp;bes. The next were
my two adopted children, and as I. heard the wor4s,
"what God has joined together let no mztli.pufasunder,"
I leaned my head upon the railing and went with joy.
* Nine halcyon years have passed since then, and we
arc now back,, in old Erin, at my childhood's home..
All see~ns the s~e here on this summer eve as in. days
gone by. The flowers ~re budding rind blooming,,'
exhaling their rich perfumes; the fountains are ~~iW
playing, whispering sweet music as the crystal drops
fall intQ the basin; the silvery~Shannon i~ still mur~~
inuring and complaining on to the sea; and Nature is
aS lavish with her gifts as she was when I was a child
and she was a child.
Paul and Amy are noble; loving, and good, and are
truly happy, No furrows mark the brow of xny young
hero-it i~ as placid as the summer sea-and~ his little
wife is a perfect sunbeam, I walk with a stick now,
~nd the great znirrQr opposite tells me that my looks

are as white as the snow; but I am just as happy as
happy can be, and fear that I am a spoiled old man7 as
Amy does everything for me. She even parts and
smooths my silvery hair, and tells me, laughing, that
it looks much prettier after it is touched by her magic
fingers..
Captain Wayland died three years after Amy's mar~
riage, and, I think, was quite repentant. Old Patrick's
green grave lies where the silvery waters of the river
he loved so well sing to him night and morning. I
can see the mound from here, and the myrtle and the
roses are twining gracefully over it. There, tooisa
monument that rises over a grave bearing the name of
Nita. This grave has been carefully attended, and i3
a beautiful little spot in itself'.
