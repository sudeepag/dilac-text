PRINTER. 1853.   JANE ARLINGTON;   OR   CHAPTER I. she Stranger it S    -Her fruitless inquiries-Jane Arlington at the Hotel -Her Meditatians. T was on a cold, rainy afternoon in the month of May, A8-, that a steamboat ap- proached the dock of the little town of d--, pleasantly situated on the western shore of Lake Champlain. Among the passengers who left the boat, mnight have been seen a young 'Wlady of very prepossessing appearance, follow- ed by a couple of the deck hands, bearing her baggage, which consisted of a large leathern trunk, who, after carelessly depositing their burthen on-the dock, returned on board the vessel. While all was confusion around, and people were hurrying to and fro, the young lady, who was clad in deep mourning, and whose face was shielded from the idle gaze - of the loungers and loafers, who ever crowd the wharves of a country place on the arrival of a vessel, by a long black veil, remained standing with her eyes cast vacantly on her trunk; heedless of the bustle about her, and seemingly absorbed in the desolate and un- rotected sitilation, *ithout a protector with her, or any one to welcome her. As the boat left the dock, a young man stepped up to her, -and thus addressed her: a Miss, will you take the carriage for the Hotel?" ' No, sir: I wish to go to Mr. Goodpy's. Do you know any person in the place by that   name?"  Her voice was so sweet and musi- cal, that the driver *as interested in her, al- though, as yet, he had not seen her face.- "No, indeed, Miss, I do not know any one here by that name," said the driver, turning at tht same time to an Irishman that was en- gaged in loading baggage intoa cart- "I say, Pat, do you know apersoh in this place by the name of Godpy? You know every one here, I beleve." "Goodpay  Goodpay! No, sure'mun, there is no man in this place by that name; and by the powers, there is none that could bear that name with- out makling a liar of his godfather; but to me own bad luck, I know a plenty of the name of Badpay here," said the Irishman. "Will you just stop your blarneyPat," said the driver, "and answer the question I put to you? - It is ho place for joking,here in the rain." " Och, sure mun, and didn't I answer the question, and more too, for that matther?" said Pat, with a sly wink to the by-standers. The driver then turned to the young lady, and said with all the politeness he was mas- ter of, "Miss, you had better step into the carriage, and go to the Hotel, where, it is probable that you can ascertain where the person you wish to find, lives." 1 Very well, sir-please to see that my trunk is brought up." So saying, she entered the carriage, and was soon at the Hotel.   The company all entered the common sit- ting-room, where usual confusion, consequent on such an occasion, ensued. ' Driver, where's my trunk?" "Driver, where is my band-box ':- "Gracious mercy! there is my band-box, all smashed down!" "Oh dear! my new bonnet is spoiled!- wet, and crushed---." "Driver,. did you fetch up my umbrella?" "Now, I declare--that is too bad! iy. new parasol is broken! I never can get any- thing home from New York, without it is spoiled before I can use it." In this manner were all engaged hn be- wailing their own mishaps, each heedless of the presence of others, and intent upon their own affairs. In a short time the bustle sub- sided, for in the space of half an hour, all the guests of the Hotel had started for the vari- ous places of their destination, with the ex- ception of our heroine, who was left sole oc- cupant of the apartment. I will now-give a short description of the young lady we have introduced to the reader. She was about seventeen or-eighteen years of age-tall, and exquisitely proportioned in form-dark eyes and hair, and altogether a model of beauty. The sphere of life she had been accustomed to move in, was plainly per- ceptible from her features, form, manners and language. Let the reader imagine a young lady, perfect and accomplished in every re- spect, and he will see before his mental eye, Miss JANE ARLINGTON, for such was the name of the young lady that we shall now beg the reader to accompany through the troubles and pleasures of life. After Jane was left alone in the sitting room, she walked several times across the room-her countenance expressing the anxi- ety she was laboring under at the time. She reflected' that she was far from all her dear friends and acquaintances, and that she was alone-totally alone, and among strangers. But as yet, the horrible deception under which she was laboring, had not been reveal- ed to her young and deeply sensitive mind. She little dreamed of the awful storm that impended, and was about to burst over her unprotected head. Not long, however, was she destined to remain in this blissful state of ignorance. She stepped up to the table, and rang a   bell that'stood upon it. In a few minutes the door opened, giving ingress to a man, whose very appearance excited very disagreeable sensations in Jane's mind. She stood for some seconds in amazement, unable to utter a word Thenew-comer was a man about five feet in height, and very corpulent. His head was covered with a thick growth of bristly gray hair, which stood perfectly erect. His eyes, which had a drunken, leering expres- sion, were overhung, and nearly concealed under long bushy eyebrows. His face was so covered with what, in the common phrase of the country, are called 'rum blotches,' that he could not be shaved without flaying one- half of the surface of his face. Therefore, that part of his toilet was usually dispensed with. He stepped; or rather staggered into the room, with a sour, forbidding expression of counte- nance, addressing Jane as he entered-- "Ho, ho! one left! Ha, well! I suppo- sed that they had all cleared out, without so much as calling for a glass. These folks think a man can keep a house for public accommo- dation, paying dear for license, for nothing.  Yes, yes-you wish to order tea. Ha, well, I'll see to it." "No sir, I did not ring for that purpose." "Oh, then you want to be shown to a room-well, I will call my gal." "No, sir, H-" "No? Why gals don't often call for li- quor, but I have the best rum, brandy and gin in these parts. I don't keep wine, for the people around here want something that will 'make drunk come quicker,' as Bill Jones says, 'than that kind of baby drink.' What shall I send you in--a good brandy sling, eh? That'll do best for a cold rainy day." He started for the door, but Jane stepped in front of him, and stopped him. "Sir, I only wished to ask if you knew a man in this town by the name of William Goodpy:   I have a letter to a man by that name, and wish to be conveyed to his resi- dence.' "Oh! that's the case, eh? Well, I don't know any one in this place by that name; but Bill Jones is in the bar-room, and as he's been Constable, a[ knows every one in the place, I'll ax hit;" and so saying, he left the room.  Jane continued to walk for a few moments, when suddenly stopping, she seemed to recol-   lect something, and taking from her pocket a t small pocket-book, which she opened and ex- I amined.                  l "Well," said she, "I have observed the E economy and prudence pointed out to me by 1 my dear uncle. He said if I was economical,  the money I had in this wallet would last me i here, and I have but one shilling left. Well, I shall now be under the necessity of draw- ing on the fifty dollars he put in my trunk. I saw he was very particular in enclosing it, and desiring me not to open it until I had arrived at --.--  I am now here, and have a perfect right to open the package. I con- clude he must have given me some good ad- vice, for I should think there was writing in it." So saying, she took a key from her pocket. She displaced the various articles the trunk contained, until she came to the bottom, from whence she drew a sealed package, the seal of which she broke, and opened the paper it contained. Another paper folded and sealed very nicely, dropped to the ground. She picked it up, opened it, and, to her horror and surprise, found that it contained nothing but these lines :-- ( It is now time that you should be infor- med of the extent of your misfortunes. Your father, at the time of his death, was very much involved. His debts were ten-fold lar. ger than any one anticipated. His whole property was insufficient to pay his debts.- By his will, you was to have the residue of his property after his debts were paid. So, you see there is nothing left for you, and you must look out for yourself. The reason I took this course, was to save myself the pain and sorrow of breaking this dreadful secret to you; and as I knew that you would be obliged to go out to service, I thought you would prefer to do so among strangers, than among your old acquaintances. The letter you have to Mr. G--- is a blank to deceive you-there is no such man. You are young, smart and healthy, and with the education that you possess; you can gain for yourself a good and honorable livelihood. I have sold all out, and shall soon go home to England. You had better not return here, as your friends will all disown you, now that they know you to be penniless." Tho paper fell from her hand-she stag- gered, and fell to the floor. A young lady,   the landlord's daughter, being in the next a- partment, on hearing the fall, immediately ran into the room, where our heroine was stretched senseless on the floor, and, as she thought, lifeless. Catherine Lawrence,"the only daughter of the landlord,' was a plain featured girl of about twenty years of age, but was possessed of as kind and affectionate a heart as ever beat within the breast of a fe- male. When Catherine entered the room, and saw Jane in the sad state we have descri- bed, she uttered a piercing scream, and ran to her assistance. At that moment a young man, a clerk in a store near by, happened to be passing on the piazza, and hearing the cry of distress, opened the door, and entered without ceremony. Seeing a young lady in that situation, he hastened to assist in resto- ring her to consciousness. With Kate's as- sistance, he raised the insensible girl, and placed her on a sofa that stood in the room. After chafing her temples, and applying the usual restoratives, she was again restored to animation. Upon opening her eyes, they fell full on the face of a young man of a fine figure and noble countenance, who was hpld- ing her hand, and whose bright intelligent eyes beamed full on her face. She gently withdrew her hand, and said in a feeble, yet musical voice- "I thank you, sir-I am quite restored now.           -  He stood like one in a trance, without seeming to have the power of removing his eyes, so charmed was he, by the beauty and nobleness of that face. He was quite uncon- scious of the impropriety of his situation, un- til Catherine spoke:--. ( Mr. Barton, I will attend to the young lady: you can withdraw." He left the room with the utmost reluc- tance, and he did not recover his presence of mind until he had gained the open air, when hereflected on the awkwardness of his situa- tion. He walked along, meditating on the bad appearance he had made, -and the few feelings in his breast. Thus ran his solilo- [ uy: i What strange thoughts and feelings the r sight of this lady has given birth to, In my y breast! Can it be possible that I am in love with her? I have never before seen her-I - know not her character, her family, or even , her name. She may be some---but no, I'll   not allow such a thought to enter my mind. Oh heavens! that face, and those eyes can- not be aught but the index of a pure, noble, and virtuous soul. Oh! if I could as easily read -the heart as I can the face, I then would know the secret cause of this burst of feele ings; but I am rejoiced that this happened. Otherwise, I might have dragged out a life of misery, and never have seen' those eyes, the silhl of which is worth a whole existence. I imust ascertain the cause of her trouble, and alle viae it at the expense of life and fortune. Oh! I had forgotten my own situation. I had forgotteni that I was a poor, disowned cast-off, forbidden ever again to cross my father's threshold, or even to bear his- name, or visit the town of my nativity, God grant that the truth may some day come to. light, and that it may not' be too late. Oh! that I had the same power that I have inclination, to assist this poor, friendless creature!" We will now leave Mr. Barton to his own meditatibons, and return to our leroine at the Inn. By this time, Jane-bad so far recover- ed as to be able to sit up ;on the sofa, by the aid of Catherine, who had become so inter- ested in the young lady with whom she had so recently formed an acquaintance, that, sit- ting as they did, folded in each other's arms, they seelned more like sisters than strangers. Catherine urged Jane to cofide in her, and disclose all her troubles and sorrows, and to pour into her sympathetic breast the cause of her sudden and unaccountable excitement. ".IMy dear girl," said Catherine, "I am so inteiested in you already, that you seem more like a sister than a casual acquaint- ance."  Jane at length yielded to the earnest, but friendly solicitations of hernew-found friend, and proceeded to relate as concisely as she could her previous history, as well as the cause of her sudden fainting. When she had concluded, Catlraeine threw her arms around her friend's neck, and resting their heads on each other's bosoms, they gave way to a pas- sion of weeping. Neither of them could speak for some time, so impeded was their articula- tion by sighs and tears. At this moment the old' landlord entered to announce his unsuc- cessful attempts to ascertain the whereabouts of the man Jane had inquired for. He was unaware, therefore, of the. excitement and  . '   ,L I V. VXJL , VAIl confusion that had prevailed in the sitting. room. "What is all this, Kate? Do you'know this gal,-or what in nater does all this here mean? HEIugging and crying as though you'd lost all your friends. Out with't!-what do you know of this gal?" "Dear father, I know she is a poor, un- fortunate girl, that is in trouble; and I am determined to be a friend to her. I am sat. isfied that she is worthy of friends better abler to assist her than I am, but she will never find one more willing." "Yes, you are willing to give away all that I have worked night and day to save,for years. You would be glad to feed every runagate hussy that comes along the streets, that can tell a good story; but I shall have a word or two to say upon that subject. I have seen too many of this kind of she-cattle, with their smooth stories, I can tell her that if she has no money to fork over the bill, she must start, and the sooner the better." And with this, he turned and entered the bar-room, Jane was overpowered by this *rude lan-' guage, and a sense of her forlorn situation.- She started for the door; for a death in the streets, she thought, would be preferable to again encountering that terrible frown from that hideous and repulsive countenance. But before she could put her design into effect, Catherine threw her arms around her, and detained her. "Dear Jane, consider what you are about. Where in the w,)rld would you go on this dark and rainy night? You shall not leave this house to-night ;for, if you go, I shall go with you. My father is perplexed and tor- mented with the business and cares of the day, and is now somewhat rude. In the mor- ning he will be quite different." "Release me, Catherine-let me go. I am an outcast. I am a burthen to the world. Let me go into the streets, and die there un- der the gracious canopy of Heaven. I have. neither money nor friends in this world. Oh, my mother-my dear mother! little didst thou think, when bestowing thy blessing on me in thy last moments, and consoling me by say- ing that I had many friends to watch over, protect, and provide for me-little didst thou dream of the sad plight to which your only child, the daughter upon whom you doated,   would, be reduced within the short space of bne year-turned into the streets, to die like a vagrant. Oh, the treachery and deceit of mankind!" "But, dear Jane, you are not without one friend. I am your friend, and will so contin- ue, if all others should desert you. Come to my room-you shall share my bed, freely; for I could enjoy nothing so long as you are in trouble." (' I cannot, my dear Catherine--I-cannot enAdpre the frowns and scorn of your father. bIy heart is already broken." "You are deceived in my father. He will appear different in the morning, for he is a kind-hearted man. Trust to me, and I will manage so that all will be right to-morrow." So saying, Catherine gently forced Jane to her chamber, where all tliings were neat and comfortable. The table was soon spread with all the necessary articles of' food, and many more luxuries than could have been expected in that secluded place. The eve- ning -was spent by the two young ladies in pleasant conversation, and it was late ere they retired. Catherine soon fell asleep, but Jane was unable to follow her example.-Her mind was too much excited by the recent discove- ries she had made, to allow her to repose.- She wept until near morning, when she be- came so exhausted that nature could no long- or hold out, and she sank into a sound and refreshingr slumber. Catherine awoke early in the morning, and arose; but she was careful not to disturb her bed-fellow, who slept as gently as a child. Catherine hearing her father below stairs, ran down to meet him, and related the pite- ous tale Jane had told her. The old man lis. tened attentively, and when she had finished the story, Kate turned, and beheld the big tears chasing each other down the old man's cheeks. She threw her arms around his neck. "Father," said she, (" go with me, and see that lovely girl, and hear her story from her own lips. It will affect you as much as it did me." "Lead on, Kate," said the old man, " let me see the girl. I fear I used language too rough last night, for the ear of so gentle and innocent a being as she must, according to your description, be. I must apologise to her for my harshness."   CHAPTER II. The Interview between our Heroine and Mr. Lawrence--  he Prospects of our Heroine, When Mr. Barton arose the following mor- ning, the sun was shining brightly, with not a cloud to obstruct his brilliant rays, which fell on the rain-drops that hung on the branches and twigs of the small bushes that skirted the lake shore, giving them the appearance of so many brilliant jewels. Hiis first thoughts were of the young lady he had so fortuitously and unexpectedly seen at the hotel on the previous evening. After completing his toilet,- the question arose in his nind, whether'it would be politic for him to call at the hotel and inquire after her health, and if possible obtain another glace at those deep, dark, expressive eyes,-which had sent such a thrill of rapture to his soul at their former meeting. He started toward the door: his hand nervously grasped the latch: he part- ly opened it, when suddenly checimg him- self, he thus soliloquised:- ( Is it expedient for me to endeavor to ob- tain another interview with the stranger men- tioned, or not? I am already madly in love with her. The last night's interview nearly turned my brain. Should I again behold her, I should be unable to refrain from throwing myself at her feet, and there passionately and boldly avow my love for her; but, on the con- trary, if I avoid seeing her, and cease to think of her, I shall soon be able to regain my for- mer tranquility of mind. --Cease to think of her!" continued he, " that can never be, at least while I am possessed of common sense: I shall never cease to think of her! My byt- ter judgment, however, teaches me that it is for the best interests of both, that I should avoid seeng her at present, and under the existing circumstaaces I cannot alleviate her Idistress at the sad misfortune which has be- fallen her. The time, I trust, is not far dis- tant, when I shall have not only the means, but the opportunity of affording her some re- lief." "( Oh, deception and falsehood! I now want a slittle of the much thou hast so unjustly wren- hed from me. 06h God! I pray that the truth V ay be brought to light before it is too late, nd that the guilty person may be made to feel the misery that I now suf'er. Oh my   father, did you but know my innocence-  .y know how unjustly I am made miserable- s how soon would you fly to me, and with open s arms embrace your rejected son!"  /Ere Jane awoke on the morning succeed- h ing the morning of her arrival in the town of r C--  , the sun had reached a point midway e between the horizon and the zenith. Approa- a ching the window, she opened the blinds, and I gazed out upon the scene before her. The ] scene was truly an enchanting one, and not- withstanding the strangeness of the surroun- E ding objects, she became so interested that N she for a moment forgot the horrors of her ( situation; but- they soon returned with re-  doubled force. "Alas! 'tis not a dream- 1 no, no, it is an awful reality, and I am in- ] deed an outcast upon the world, among stran- ( gers and unbefriended, and perhaps doomed to lead a life of misery and wretchedness," murmured she to herself, as she stood at the window gazing at the beautiful scene which lay before her. She was aroused from the partial reverie into which she lad fallen, by the sound of approaching footsteps upon the stairs. A cold shudder- rapidly passed: over her delicate frame.7 She dreaded to meet the man whose appearance had so terrified her "the evening before. The door opened, and Catherine, the landlord's daughter, entered the apartment. Jane started forward to meet her, but suddenly beholding the host emer- ging from the hall, she shrunk back in terror. Catherine perceiving her fright, -ran towards her, and throwing her arms around her neck, kissed her pale cheeks, then turning partly around, said- "Miss Arlington, allow me to introduce you to my father." Jane hardly dared to raise her eyes, but by a strong effort she overcome the sense of fear which pervaded her, rnd looking him in fle face, she perceived his eyes were wet with tears, and that a sympathizing expression had settled upon his bluff and unprepossessing countenance. Slowly advancing towards her, he extended his hard horny hand to her, and said- "Miss Arlington, allow me to call myself your friend, and to ask your pardon for the rudeness I showed towards you last evening. My daughter has slready informed me of your misfortunes, and while I sincerelyregret that they bave fallen upon the head of one so   young, lovely and interesting. I heartily sympathize with'you, and cheerfully offer my services to do all that is in my power to alle- viate your distress. You are welcome to my house, and I should be happy to have you remain with us as long as you shall be pleas- ed to do so, for I need not assure you that I am convinced that one like you would not be guilty of uttering a falsehood, and moreover practicing upon: us a base deception.  '. You are too kind-too generous," said she, weeping, and placing her snowy hand within his, " to ask pardon of one who is cast upon the charity of the world. Neither do I blame you for your suspicions, for you had good reasons to suspect imposition. I heartily thank you for your kindness and good opinion of me, and hope that you may never have cause to repent of your goodness towards me, or regret having placed confidence in me. In regard to the truth of my assertions, you will find it in this document," said she, hand- ing lim. the letter she had taken from her trunk. " No, Miss-put up your letter; I can believe you without requiring any' proof as to the truth of -what you say. If there is any way in which I can serve you, all that re- mains for you to do is to name in which way I' can serve you best, and I will do so, and be happy in so doing." You are kind indeed, sir, and you will be doing me great service if you will endea- vor to procure for me a situation where I can obtain employment, and thus relieve myself of the mortification of being dependent for my living upon the generosity of those who are in no way bound to assist me." "You are wrong, Miss, and take your mis- fortunes too much to heart. You are a wel- come guest -at my house, as I have before said ; but Tf you will not remain with us, I will do my best in getting for you such a L place as you may desire." Saying which, mine host left the two young ladies, and returned to his own room, where L he found -his wife impatiently awaiting him. Ie immediately informed her of the conver- f sation that had ensued between him and the  stianger, and then said- ("She wants some place to work. Do you r know of one that would want her? I should t be glad to assist her. She is as fine a young- ) lady as one would ever wish to meet with."   "Well, I do declare, now!" exclaimed the old -lady, "the gals that come along now-a- 1 days, there aint no dependence on 'em. They I think more of combin' and curlin', than they do of cleanin' the pots and kettles." "Well, well, wife, I tell you that this is as nice a gal as you ever seed, and you needent be afeard to recommend her," answered the old man, somewhat sharply. ("Well, then, there's Mrs. Prim, she told me she wanted a gal, t'other day, an4 I'll go and see her, and she can come and shee the gal herself, and I shan't have toWrecommend her." Mrs. Prim was the witfe of a merchant who resided in that place, and who employed young Barton. Accordingly, the landlady called on Mrs. Prim that afternoon. In order to prevent the reader from falling into error, it may be necessary here to state that the real name of the lady last mentioned, was Prime, not Prim-the latter cognomen being given to her by her neighbors, on ac- count of her excessive particularity as to eti- quette, and the utter abhorrence she had of speaking to, or even sitting in the same room with those styled by her ' the laboring class.' The reader will, at some subsequent part of our story, be able to judge-of her character, in regard to virtue and morality. CHAPTER III. A New Character introduced-A Descrip- tion of Mrs. Prim---Interview between Mfrs. Prim and our Heroine. Soon after her father had left the room, Kate proceeded to lay the breakfast table.- After having accomplished which, they both partook heartily of the morning meal. When they had finished their breakfast, and every thing being removed, Kate placed a number of books on the table, telling her companion to amuse herself as best she could. "I have business," said Kate, " that is ,indispensable to attend to about the house, and will again return to you as soon as those duties jre performed." Immediately after the departure of Kate from the apartment, Jane endeavored, in ac- cordance with the kind invitation of her friend, to amuse herself with the books; but she strove in vain to fasten her attention upon any one of the numerous works that lay before her.-   She was too much agitated,-her mind was wholly occupied with the thoughts relative to her forlorn situation. She hurriedly paced the apartment, now and then stopping in front of the window, and stood silently gazing with a vacant stare upon the surrounding objects. Thus unquietly and unpleasantly she passed the greater share of the day. Kate would oc- casionally step in and endeavor to cheer her, but her efforts were futile--Jane would smile, but her smiles were forced, and her compan- ion saw it plainly, yet she did not relax in her endeavors, but strove the harder. In the course of the afternoon, while Kate and our heroine were conversing together up- on the probability of their success in obtain- ing a situation, footsteps were heard approa- ching the chamber. Jane hastily brushed a- way a tear that was slowly trickling down her cheek. The door opened, and the old land- lady very unceremoniously ushered into the apartment the noted Mrs. Prim. "This is the girl, Mrs. Prim, that I spoke to you about." Jane stood facing the two ladies, expecting an introduction, which ceremony she suppo- sed was always performed upon such and sim- ilar occasions. Mrs. Prim viewed her for some time from head to foot, and then turning to the old lady, very complacently remark- ed- !"Well, she don't suit me exactly. She looks as though she was too much of a lady to suit me. I don't want a servant that wears so many silks and ribbons about them."- Then turning to Jane, she addressed her as follows: "What is your name?-Where have you worked?-Have you any recommend, to show your character?" "No madam, I have no recommendations, for I have never been obliged to work to ob- tain a livelihood. I was once wealthy, but i am at present a poor, unfortunate girl, alone , in the world, and would be glad to gain for 3 myself a reputation for honesty, integrity and virtue, and in the meantime a living, which, J if God gives me strength, I am willing to do. - If you will take me on trial, I will do all , that is in my power to please you. I shall B undoubtedly at first need some instruction, B having, as I have before said, never been un- der the necessity of working for a living;   but I think I can soon learn. My name is Jane Arlington." "Yes, yes!-the same old story. I have heard it too often to believe it. These girls, that are running about the country, nobody knows who they are, or where they come from, have always been rich and don't know how to work, generally sooner or later show their real character, and those that have the least to do with them, are usually the best off in the end." Jane felt not only grieved, but hurt; and indignatin for a time reigned within her bo- som. Instantly recollecting her destitute sit- uation, she checked the rising emotion of an- ger; and the severe reply she was about to make. Wiping away the tears which the in- solent language of Mrs. Prim had caused to flow into her eyes, she thus answered her: "Dear madam, I can only pledge you my honor that if you will give me an opportuni- ty, I will convince you that-my story is true, and that my character is good." "I declare", Mrs. Lawrence!" exclaimed Mrs. Prim, " 1 am half inclined to take this girl. It might be a deed of charity. You know that I always think a great deal of per- forming charitable and benevolent acts. You know that the pbor people all expect some- thing handsome from me, arid you alsol know that I am always good to the poor." "I think, Mrs. Prim, you had better hire her-she may possibly make you a good ser- vant, anid stay with you along time, as she has no friends to go to. You know that you have found it difficult to retain your girls for any length of time;" "' Well, Jane, what do you expect me to 'give you a week? You can't expect much, as you say you don't know how to do much." "I will leave that entirely to yourself, ma- dam," answered Jane, and, continued she, "I will stay with you a few weeks, and then you can tell me what you can afford to give me." "Well," said Mrs. Prim, "you may paiek up your duds, and come over, and I'll try you. Just at this moment Kate came in, and re- quested Jane ,should,knot go until the next morning,. saying she would send a boy over the next morning with her trunk.   Oh, my!" exclaimed Mrs. Prim,   ' t wouldn't give much for a servant that could, n't carry her own trutik just across the street.'i This statement grieved Kate, as she was well aware how sensitive were the feelings of her young friend. "Oh, Mrs. Prim," answered Kate, mild- ly, " the trunk is very large and heavy. I am sure the young lady could not carry it, ax you know she is not very strong." "Oh! really, Miss Kate," said Mrs. Prim pertly " theh I am to call her the youny lady, ani I? Well, I am under a thousand obliga tions to you for giving me notice. -I might' have wounded her feelings by calling her my servant. q1, if I had not received this time- ly admonition from you in regard to my phra- seology." Kate felt very sorry for what she had said, not only on her own account, but on that of -her friend, who appeared to be exceedingly hurt by the insulting language used by Mrs. Prim. "Now, allow me to inform you, Katfi said Mrs. Prim, " that you are spoiling all the servant girls in this place, by too much familiarity. You male make them think that they-are superior to their mistresses. As for myself, I want a servant should know her place, and if she don't know it, and keep it, I dont want her in my employ; but she can stay with you till morning, as you are so anx- ious for her company ; -but if you were rmy girl, or my sister, you would soon stop asso- ciating with the laboring class.' '" After her ladyship had finished her har- atague to Kate, she walked away with the stately step of a queen, imaginng in her own mind the noble, and imposing appearance she had made, and the exalted opinion the two young ladies must now entertain of her. The two young ladies spent the afternoon D very pleasantly, Kate did all that was in her power to instruct Jane in the art of house- : keeping, and informing her how she would r have to manage to keep friends with her new mistress. She told her to do the best she could, and t she would try and get a place for her in some r reputable family as instructress, which she hoped soon to be able to accomplish.   CHAPTER IV.          t Jane enters upon a new life--her amiable i lMistress--Her Plans---Mr. Barton visits c Jane-Sudden and unexpected interrup- 1 tion--lDenouement of    Mrs. Prim's 1 Plans--Our Heroine again thrown on    t the world-A new situation-M-r. Bar- ton's departurefrom C The next morning, according to her agree- ment, Jane started for her new residence.- She Kissed. Kate on parting, and seemed quite cheerful; For the first timo'in her life, she was to carn her bread by the sweat of her brow. She had not yet learnt the first lesson of a servant, and she stepped up to the front door, not thinking that there was any other to get into the house, She had never before in her life entered any house but her father's by the kitchen door. She knocked, and a tall, shad-faced, red-haired old maid opened the door. Seeing her and the trunk standing on the platform, she soon thought who the stran- ger was. "What do you wishT'  enquired the old maid. "Is Mrs. Prim in?" said Jane--"I en- gaged yesterday  to come and work for "Oh," said the thin-faced lady, "you're the servant girl my sister hired, are you? "I am," replied Jane.  "Well, I see yo -don't know your place: if you did, you -would not come with your traps to the front door. I guess sister'll get enough of such klind of servants before long. Take your trunk, and go to the kitchen door," So saying, she shut the door, and left her.-- The boy had gone, and Jane could not car- ry her trunk. She stood for a few moments, at-a loss what to do, when she saw a boy en- ter the yard. She asked him if he would be kind enough to assist her to carry her trunk to the kitchen door. He readily assisted her, and she was soon in the kitchen. To relate the numerous insults and cut- tingo words that were heaped upon our hero- ine, by the noble Mrs. Primi and her lovely sister, during her stay with them, would fill a volume; but notwithstanding, she submit- ted to her painful lot with fortitude and re- signation. The second day after Jane enter- B To   ed her new homne,. and upon her new avoca- tion, she was thought to be. sufficiently qual- ified to appear before her mistress's chair to obey her summons during breakfasts She had her orders to stand directly behind her mistress's chair, to obey the orders from the table'; but she was particularly charged not to speak. The family consisted of the lady, her sister, and Mr. Barton, the clerk, with whom the reader is already acquainted. Mr Barton did not notice the girl that was waitinz on the table, for it was so common a thing for Mrs. Prim to have a new girl every other day, that lhe thought nothing of it, and he did not look at her until hre had nearly finisbed his breakfast, when he happened to cast his eyes upon her, and encountered the sorrowfll glance Jane bent upon him. She moldestly turned her head to avoid his piercing look, fiir she had seen him but once, and then tLwhn sl\e was not in a situation to remark a- ni one, and therefore she didxnot recognize himl. liarton had neither seen nor heard from the fair stranger, since their singular interview at the 1 mi.. The sight of Jane astonished and Icwildcred him, and awakened in his breast the passion that he had striven to keep down. I-He rose. from the table and abruptly left the room wi'thout utterring a word. The truth was lie did not dare to trnst himself to speak, for fear he might betray his emotion. He proceeded directly to the store his mind oc- cupied with the all-engrossed subject. He thus communed with himself.  "What can this mean? a young lady so beautiful, intell- igent and accomplished, occupying a menial station in our family. There is some mys- tery here, which I must solve, I must know her history, but where can I gain this infor- mation?' He paused-'I have it,' exclaim- ed he, :at length, ' I will see Kate immediate- ly, and from her, I will assartain the knowl- edge I so much desire.' He soon arrived at the Village Inn, and was shown to the setting room where Kate was. "Miss Lawrence, I have called to apolo- gise for the unceremonious manner in which I entered your room the other evening, when- you were there with another young lady. I [ thought there might be some one in distress, as I heard a scream. I hardly know what I did then, I was placed in so extremely awr-  ward a position."   "I do not think', Mr. Barton, that there is any necessity for an apology. I think it wo'd have been ungallant in you, to have passed without notice, on hearing a lady's scream." "' Then I was not mistaken. I imagined I heard .a scream, and ranin without being sure. I have since thought you might con- sider my entrance a rude intrusion." '.' N6 sir, I was very glad that you came. It relieved me of a great deal of anxiety.- The young lady was really in trouble, and I was very much frightened."      t "You must excuse my inquisitiveness, Miss Oatherine, but I should wish to learn some- thinge that young lady, and her history; for I am convinced there is some dark mystery in her case. I have been quite anxious to hear of her ever since that interview, and you may judge of my astonishment-when I beheld her this morning performing the dut'ewo a ser- vant at Mrs. Prim's--a station which I am convinced she never held before.' Her air, language, manners and accomplishments, all tend to confirm me in this opinion." "You are correct in your opinion, Mr, Bar- ton," said Kate; " that young lady has seen better days, and you and I must befriend her. The situation of governess would be a more fitting one for so well anl eduecated and deli- cate a lady, and you and I must rrocuie her oiuch a situation." Then complying with Mr. Barton's earnest request, Kate gave the meagre details of Jane's story, being all that she knew; as well  as the contents of the letters and papers that Jane had shown her, to corroborate her state- ments. "And," .said Kate, as she conclu- ded, "I am convinced she tells nothing but the truth." "i Her statements must be true," said Bar- ton, as hastily brushed away a tear that had been forced by his emotion onto his manly cheek. "You must excuse this weakness, Miss Lawrence. It brings to my mind my own sad story, which I will tell you when a convenient opportunity offers. Thatgirl, Miss Lawrence, I am convinced is incapable of ut- tering a falsehood; but oh, Kate! I am sor- ry she is at Mrs. Prim's. You little know the disposition of those two women-they will ounstantly insult and abuse her. Should I espouse herIaus, or appear to take any in- terest in her, my situation would, assuredly, be loot. I am very deairouG of doing sodae-,   thing for her, but you must act as my agont, for all I can do, must be done through your agency. Tell her I am anious to befriend and assist her. I will seek an opportunity to converse with her myself." Time passed on, and Mr. Barton, so tho't the Prims, became quite changed. he was very unsocial at Vleals-finever speaking un- less to answer a question, and then his replies -were monosyllabic. Mrs. Prim often rallied him on his melan- choly air-said he took too little exorcise- that the horse and carriage was at his service, and that the boy should take him a ride eve- ry day, and that her sister would always be glad to accompany him. Mr. Barton. replied that he could not leave the storeiuntil Mr. Prim returned from New York, to which place he had gonedht this time for for goeds. Mrs. Prim kept constantly har. ping on this subject, but Mr. Baiton resolute- ly refused his assent to all such plans. One afternoon, soon after Jane went to her residence, Mrs. Prim entered the kitchen, where she found Kate Lawrence,' and her ser- vant girl,- as she always took pains to call Jane, in close conversation, both in tears, and apparently much affected. 'Miss Kate Lawrence," said she, as she approached them,!"I wish you would attend to your own buiness. I have often told you before that you associate quite too much with the lower classes ; and you will do"'ell to I keep out of my kitchen. I can't get a 'er- vant but you must fill their heads with high notions, spoiling them for my use, or for any one else." "I ask your pardon, Mrs. Prim," said Catherine--"I formed a partial acquaintance with this young lady when she came here, and I felt an anxiety for her welfare. I thought as she had no aquaintances here, she would feel lonely, and that it could neither harm her or you, for me to call and see he. But I will take care never again to intrude upon your premises." C "Kate," said Mrs. Prim, " you know that my intentions are good,-that I advise you for your own interest; and you musthe a- ware that it is not for your advaptage to as- sociate with such low characters." "Mrs Prim," said Kate, "I know this girl is no bad character ; and she deserves btter treatment than to be called so."   "Yes,' said Mrs. Prim, "you believe all these girls tell you, spoiling them, and ma- king yourself ridiculous. If you would leave these low girls alone, you could assciate with myself, my sister, and all tl6 first class in town; but you never can, so 'ong as you pur- sue this course. My sister -nd Mr. Barton often walk out, and they would call on you, were it not likely that they would meet some of the lower class there." Kate, without replying, left the'room, think- ing that it would answer her purpose better, so to do, than to multiply words. The following Sunday morning at breakfast, Mrs. Prim told Mr. Barton that she and her sister were going to the uper town that day to church, and should like his company. Mr. Barton stammered out something, not knowing exactly what answer to make,but at length he said, "( I should be quite pleased to go, but you know we expect Mr. Prim home this week, and it is necessary that I should post the books which are somewhat behind, even under the necessity of doing so on tlisi day." Mrs Prim used all her eloquence to per- suade him to let the books go, and accompa- ny them to church; but it was all to no pur- pose, for he was determined.     A Accordingly, at the usual time, the carriage was heard to roll off with the two noble ladies. Barton looked out of the store, and saw 'the carriage depart and he was not long after that at his books. He saw the carriage dis- appear behind the hill, and looking the store, he was soon in the kitchen, beside the object of. his affections. t"Miss Arlington,' said Barton, as he sea- ted himself by the kitchen fire, "I have long- ed for this opportunity ever since I met you at the Hotel. Myspeace of mind is entirely dependent upon this interview I wish to sym- pathize with you, and in return I expect sym- pathy, for our cases are very similar. I have heard the outlines of your story fyom our mu- tual friend, Catherine. I now hope to hear it from your own lips, and in return, I will, for the first time, relate my own melancholy story." "Mr. Barton," said Jane,!"I am sorry that you should interest yourself in my fate, as it will prove, I fear, an injury to us both. I have heard from Catherine, of the flattering interest you have evinced in my case; and I   am sure that if Mrs. Prim should know, or even mistrust, I sliould be turned out of the house, and I have no friends to look to for protection. , I know what het plans are, as regards yourself and her sister. So, sir, it will be for our Mutual benefit for you not to notice me in the future. Let me suffer alone, without involving in my own misfortune those who are in no better situation to avert it than I myself." "A My dear girl, trifle not with myfeelings, I beg of you, You little know the torture I have suffered for the last few days. I can endure this suspense no longer. You say you are destitute of friends; but you have two as good as ever human being had, and they will never deceive nor desert you." Jane then commenced and related her sto. ry to him, which was told in that simple, un- varnished style that most impresses a person with the truth of what they are hearing.- When she had concluded her story, Barton could restrain his passion no longer. He threw himself at her feet, clasping her delicate hand he repeatedly pressed to his lips, and then a- vowed his love for her. "Oh, Jane!" exclaimed he, "I told you I was your friend; but now, dear girl, per- mit me to call myself by a more endearing title. Allow me to say I am your devoted lover. At your feet I ask but for-a smile of approbation-a single ray of hope." Jane gently withdrew her hand, and with a melancholy smile said- "  Mr Barton, you are beside yourself: you cannot wish to throw yourself away on one so much beneath you. Had I the fortune I once possessed, Iwould accept the hand and noble heart you so generously offer me. But I cannot now-I cannot indulge the thought of degrading you, whose prospects in life are so fair, by dragging you down to the level of a poor servant girl, irretrievably ruining you in the eyes of the world." l Bliss Arlington," said le, "-you are tri- fling with my feelings. I have not yet told you my sorrows and troubles. I am already? more degarded in the eyes of the world than you think me; but God be praised, I am ia- nocent of the crimes they impute to me." He then briefly related his history. As he finished, he turned to Jane, and beheld her sympathizing tears falling on her heaving breast He throw his arms around her, pres-   sod her delicate form to his breast, and eager. ly kissed away those pearly drops. At that moment the hall door opened, and Mrs. Prim and her lovely sister entered. The two lover were so absorbed in the overflow of their feelings, that they heard them not till they were in the room. -     - Mrs. Prim stood for a moment, and with flashing eyes gazed upon them asthey moved apart. She saw at a glance that her project was dissipated into tOhin air-she saw that the very thing which she supposed would increase Mr. Barton's esteem for her sister, namely, the getting a servant to wait upon her, had overthrown her whole project. She thought Mr. Barton as destitute of sense as herself; but she was mistaken in the man. She at length spoke-- "A pretty place this! Little did I think, Miss, to degrade my house thus, by being charitable to you. Miss, you have shown what you are! And you, Mr. Barton,.1 think had better see to your books, about which you were so anxious. ILwill see you another day." Mr. Bartons thinking perhaps the storm might blow over,. and that " the least said is the soonest mended," left the house without saying a:word.  He however kept a good look-out to see what turn matters took in the house. He had not been long in the'store, before he saw the kitchen-do& open, and Jane extruded therefrom. Her trunk was tumbled after her. He hesitated not a moment, but ran to the assistance of the weeping Jane. "Oh, Mr. Barton!" said she, "' this is as :I feared. I have been turned- out- of doors, "and loaded with all the abuse that language is capable of expressing. I am destitute and unprotected." "Sever mind, Jane-I am glad this has happened  I am  glad you are out of that house. Fear nothing-- yu have friends who will protect you."  *"But you, too, will be dismissed ipy loss is nothing coinpared with yours. -You have lost a good situation through my means. Oh! I bring misery an all who lbefriend me. Would that I had died ere this had happened." "Calm yourself, Jane," said Barton, as he drew her arm withifn his, "gall will be well." So saying, they walked on to the 1Hotel where Kate met them at the door, and welb   corned them with true affection. Barton told her he wanted Jane to stay there a few days, hoe paying her board, and then left. The two girls embraced each other, and Jane related what had happened at Mrs. Prim's. "It is even as I expected," said Kate, "and I am not sorry, for I was determined you should leave there." Mr. Barton, in the"mneantime, returned to the store, where he formed a resolution how to proceed. -He well knew he should soon have to leave C----, and he determined to go and ascertain the truth of Jane's state- ments, and see if the business had been fair- ly settled. The next day, a gentleman from an adjoin- ing town came into Mr. Prim's store, and said that he wished he could find some accomplish- ed young lady to instruct his daughters. Mr. Barton told him that he knew the very person he wanted. tIe accompanied tie gentleman to the Inn, and introduced him to Miss Ar- lington. After an examination, a bargain was closed, and he carriSedJane home with him. A few days after the events we have rela- ted, Mr. Prim returncd from New York, and was informed of the transactions that had. ta- s lken place, which were magnified ten-fold, and painted in the blackest colors that envy, mal- ice and revenge could suggest. Mr. Barton was accordingly paid up and dismissed by- Mr. Prim. Barton felt happy that Jane was so well provided for; but hoe revealed his intentions to no one. After writing a few hastylines to Jane, and putting the letter in the hands of Kate Lawren6e, he bade adieu to his few friends in C----, and took the steamboat for the South. CHAPTER V. Jane is ,deprived of her place sthrough Mrs. Prim's enmity--Herforlorn situationi-- Taken sick at afarm-house-Dr. Epsom -A   new protector--.Dr. Cole--Jane's removal to the latter gentleman's resi- dence. Jane was quite happy in her new situation. Mr. Southgate, the gentleman with whom she had engaged, had two daughters, one about fourteen, and the other about thirteen years of age. They were placed with Jane, for he could afford them instruction in any of the d .           -   h1igher branches, and was likewise an amia- ble and cheerful companion. Jane was so - pleasantly situated, and everything went on so smoothly, that she had nearly forgotten her troubles-when, to her astonishment, one day as she was sitting at a window, gazing down the street, she beheld a carriage rolling along the avenue, and drive up to 5Mr. Southgate's door, and Mrs. Prim, with her sister, emer- ged from the carriage, and entered the house. As the two ladlies stepped into the room, Mrs. Prim infrodaced herself and her sister to Mrs. Soutlegate. "I have taken the pains," said 5Mrs. Prim, (commencing the conversation,) ",to drive ' here to-day, to caution you in respect to some- thing in which you are deeply interested. I am informed that you have two young daugh- ters who bear the reputation of being fine young ladies, and that you have lately taken into your service a young lady whose name is Jane Arlington, as an instructress. I am al- ways ready to do all I can to detect impos- ,tcrs before they have time to accomplish much misehief, and I hope that I shall succeed in this instance."  "' What!" exclaimed Mrs. Southgate, in great astonishment, "( do you mean to have ie I understand that Jane is an imposter? It u'rely cannot be, she is so innocent and affec- tionate. Please inform me what you know concerning her character." "Oh, mercy!" cried the red-lheaded old mnaid, "don't, in my-presence, sister--it makes mie shudder to think of it!" "( For mercy sake!" cried bIrs. Southgate, "t let mn know what she has been guilty of. I am frilghtened already." "Well, my dear Mrs. Soultgate,"  said Mrs. Prim, 'this girl came along in the steam- boat, and wanted to get work. As a deed of chairty, I took her i ; and the very next day after she came to live withi me, I thought our clerk appeared quite cunning, squinting, and winking at her while she was waiting on the tVible--besides, I heard noises in her chamber, and always heard the door open a.. bout dayllight; and morever, don't you think that wlhen Sunday came, our clerk said that he had business in the store, and could not attend church. Well, when we returned from church, I never was more astonished in my life than I was then, to find them in the kitchen. "Myl modesty forbids my saying more." rl   ',        81VYU vrlrr rJrrj   The old maid turned her head around, and put her handkerchief up to her face to hide the blushes with wfiich her soft and rosy cheeks were profusely mantled. "I sent her off that night," continued Mrs. Prim, " and when Mr. Prim came home, he -dismissed the clerk, so we have got rid of them both."  - ("I am astonished," exclaimed Mrs. South- gate, *' that such can possibly be the charac- ter of so handsome a young lady-I thought her the most modest and virtuous girl that ever lived. Well, she will have to start fi'om here: I am very much obliged td you qf' the information you have given me." "I thought you would be thankful to hear the truth of the case. One can't be too care- ful of the company their daughters keep." After Mrs. Prim had- acquitted her con- science of the terrible burden which had for so long a time overwhelmed it, by delivering the above message, she returned to her car- riage, and drove off horne. The nest morning, Jane received her dis- sal, and was told by her angry mistress, 'nev- er to set foot within heT house again.' The poor persecuted girl pleaded for an explanation with tears in her eyes; but it was of no avail. She inquired what Mrs. Prim had told her; but was ordered to quit the house immediately, and was not allowed *an attempt to vindicate her guiltlessness of the charges preferred against her. She re- quested permission to bid the two young 1a- dies farewell; but this was also denied her. She gave a boy a shilling to assist her in car- rying her trunk to a little village about three miles distant. The fatigue of walking and carrying one end of her trunk was so severe that when she arrived at the village she was unable to sit up. Calling at the door of a small house, she expressed a wish to stop and rest herself.' They consented, andther-trunk was taken into the house, and she was shown to a bed in the second story. About tea-time, the lady of the house- kindly invited her to take some supper, but she declined, and a cup of tea was brought to her by the kind and attentive old lady, who, after kindly assisting her to undress, left her. She slept but little; and in the morning, when the woman entered, she found her in a high fever, and delirious.. A physician was immediately sent for. t   Doctor Epsom was the bnly physician in the Village, and' the reader can judge as to his skill in the healing art by what shall be said hereafter. He came hurrying in, and making numerous inquiries, of which the following appeared to be the principal ones: "Who is she? Where did she formerly reside? Jas she any friends in this section offthe country? Has she any money?" &c. &c.; but the an- swer he received of "I dont know, sir," to all his questions, could not, according to all appearances, been very satisfactory, as he was observed, each time the answer was repeated, to shake his head; but when the old lady in- formed him that she possessed a large trunk, the weight of which being a pretty sure indi- cation of its being well filled, it seemed. to - produce a change in the Doctor's mind ; for he immediately stepped up to the ted, and. taking the young lady's wrist in his hand, he took from his pocket a large heavy silver watch, and stood for some time motionless.- At length, slowly turning away from the bed, 'he stood anxiously expecting the question u- sually asked upon such occasions. The old lady asked what he thought of the young lady's situation.  He gave a very knowing shake of the head, and said-- "An obstinate case-a very obstinate case indeed. I will try, however, to raise her; but it is quite doubtful. It is -such a case as is 'not often met with in this country. Do you know what is in the trunk? Have you open- ed it?" "No, sir." - You say it is quite heavy, thouah." "Yes, -ir. Dr. Epsom took up his saddle-bags, and hanging them across his knee, took from them two phials, one containing pulverized char- coal, the other scorched flour. He proceeded to do up twelve papers, with five grains of the contents of each phial in each paper. He then left directions for them to give a powder every two hours, saying that le would call a- gain on the morrow. The next day, about the same hour, he made his appearance--in- quired how the girl was, and what effect the medicine had. The' nurse answered-- "She is much the same, sir. The medi- cine has had no iffect at all. The poor, thing hasn't known anything since she has been here, and- I'm afraid she never will."   After feeling her pulse again, and giving the same knowing shake of the head, he re- plied-           e "I think, good woman, that you have suf- ficient reasons for your fears. I fear myself, that she will meet with an-untimely end," and proceeding to fold up his twelveopapers as before, of the same medicine, he gave the same directions, and took his departure. Thus the wise Doctor PEpsom, every day, for at least four days, continued the same unva- ried course-not omitting to ask, with remar-r kable punctuality, if sho had opened the trunk -inot. she had better do so, and got some clean linen for the patient. But the wo- man still neglected to do so, probably not be- ing quite so anxious to know'the contentsof the trunk as the Doctor. It happened luckily for our heroine that on the fourth day of her sickness, another per- son, a resident of that place, was taken dani gerously ill, and a physician from another town, about twenty miles distant, was sent ,for to attend hin-a man of noted skill, and a man of science. After he had prescribed for his patient, he called upon Doctor Epsom, who, as a matter of form,- invited him to go with him and see a patient under his care.- The invitation was accepted. Upon their arrival at the house, Doctor Epsom walked up to the patient, and went through with the usual ceremony. He then stepped back, and asked Doctor Cole (that was the name of the new physician) to exam. ine her, case, which he did. !"What do you call her disease, Doctor?" asked he, after concluding his examination. "I call it," said Doctor Epsom,!" a secre- tion of bile in the liver," and he rolled up his eyes with a very knowing look. i A secretion of the d--l," said Doctor Cole. "It is -an inflammation of the brain, and may produce congestion, in-which case it will be fatal. But she can, and must be cured. You say that she has no friends here. and no money. That is just such a patient as I want, 'and I will take her off your hands, pay you for what you have done, and run my own risk of my pay. You say you have your doubts about curing her, and'so have I, if you go on as you have commenced. But I say that she can be cured, and that too in a , very short time." The truth was, Doctor Cole wa a young   man, and felt somewhat interested in the fair being before him. He was plhysiognomist e- nough to see that she was no common charac- ter, and that she had been brought up in the lap of wealth and luxurjtHe also felt con- fident that she had friends; but where they were, he could not tell. "Make out your bill, Doctor Epsom, and 1 will cash it," continued the youngest phy- sician. The Doctor was glad to get his money, and willing to give up a poor patient, if he could be sure of the cash. His bill was as follows: - Town of    , 18-. "DOCTOR COLE "To DOCTOR EPSOM DR. "*To attendance on stranger lady at "Mrs.   -  's,          f "Five visits,  8s.   $5,00 "Medicine,   20s.   2,50 $7,50 "R eceived payment. "DOCTOR EPSOM."' 'Vell," said Doctor Cole, "your visits are well enough; but your medicine is not worth more than two dollars and a half a barrel." This rather raised Doctor Epsom's dander. He turned upon Doctor Cole with as much maliceW in his eye as Colonel Crockett ever had in Mis when looking at a bear. "Ductor Cole," said he, " you are no gen- tleman,nor is this the first time you have in- sulted me ; and, sir, if you do hold such a high opinion of yourself, you will have to learn that it will not 4to to insult me in my own town, where I have been the only doc- tor that has practiced here for the last ten years." "i Hush'! hbish!" said Doctor Cole, "we Doctors miustn't go to quarrelling. You must learn to take a joke better than that,---you don't know me yet. I was only joking.- There is your money, Doctor. I ask your pardon, if I injured your feelings; for I as- sure you that I onlyrmeant it as a joke." Doctor Epsom extended his hand and re- ceived the money, merely remarking,' I supposed you were like myself, always in earnest."  After carefully counting the monkey, he as   carefully placed it in his pocket, and walked away, thinking that he had, for once, made a good bargain. I Doctor Cole then proceeded t. prescribe for the patient, and left her; but soon retur- ned and spent the night with her; In the mor- ning he had the satisfaction, if I may sospeak, at any rate he had the pleasure of seeing her much better, and in her right mind. She be- gan to make some inquiries of the Doctor; but he told her to be quiet, and when she was better he would then willingly answer all her questions. After giving the necessary injunctions in regard to her diet and medi- cine, he left to visit his other patient. The third day after Jane recovered her senses, the Doctor allowed her to talk, and she related to him her history from the be. ginning up to the present time. He said that her history coincided with the opinion that he had already formed regarding her, and expressed an. opinion that she had been wronged and cheated out of her proper- ty; but wished that she would be able to re- cover it at some future day. Jane expressed her gratitude for his kind- ness, and again felt that she had one friend in the world. In the course of two or three days, Doctor Cole's other patient had so far recovered that he pronounced him convalescent, and prepa- red to return home. "i I have no money, Doctor," said Jane, *but I have plenty of clothing and some jewels. Go to my trunk, and take- from them until you are paid," and offered him the key. "( No, Miss Arlington," rejoined he, " put up your key-you know better than any one else the value of the contents of your trunk. You must go home and remain with me un- til you succeed in finding a more sincere friend than I am, and one that can do better by you than I can. Until you find such an one, I shall never allow you to leave me." Jane at first felt inclined to doubt his sin- cerity, and thought she had better remain where she was ; but after due deliberation upon a question which was of so momentous a nature to her, and one in which her future misery or happiness were so deeply involved, she at last consented to accept his kind offer and accompany him to his residence.   CHAPTER VI.     , Retrogression7 in our Tale--.History of Jane's Parents-Their love and union-- The early History of Jane's Life--Shell Harbor-Death of Mr. Arlinglton. The reader is doubtless aware that in the previous numbers there are many things which have not been explained : we allude to transactions prior to the commencement of our Tale. In order that the reader may more fully understand the hidden reasons for the actions of our principal characters, we shall now draw the curtain which shrouded their former historygn mystery, and unfold the ne- farious plans by which their ruin had been been accomplished. To do this, it is neces- sary to retrograde nearly a quarter of a cen- tury. About twenty years previous to the com- mencement of our story, a young man by the name of George Arlington, graduated with the highest honors at'Yale College. He had worked his way through college by teaching school four or five months in every year. He always managed, by increased assiduity and application, to keep up with the rest of his class. When he received his diploma, and launched into the world, he had not ive dol- Ilars. He had .been extremely prudent while going through his collegiate course, and he was well provided in the article of clothes.- He know no one to applyto for advice or aid. George was acquainted with a Lawyer, Sharp by name, as well as in practice, who resided in a little village, not more than, a hundred miles from Boston. George settled upall his affairs at New Haven, and started immediately after for the town of W----, to see Esquire Sharp, and to try his luck in the world. On his arrival in that village, he di- rected hs steps towards Squire Sharp's. office. He found his old acquaintance,- and immedi- ately informed him of his object in visiting him at that time. He told him that he was anxious to attend to the study of the Law, and desired to enter his office as a student if they could strike a bargain. The Squire told him he could not have come in a better time: that he had more business than he could do alone, and that he would give him' board and tuition for his assistance in the office. Arling- ton readily accepted these terms. George en- tered upon the duties of his new situation   with delight and assiduity, and all went on smoothly for five or six months. One day he wa/s inquiring of a friend where he could get some sewing dorils His friend referred him to a widow, who 1ed' about a mile out of the village, who did such work beautifully. Her -name, he said, was Mrs. Simons, and he di- rected him where to find the house. Acoebrdingly, on the next morning, a plea- sant day in the middle of May, he started for Mrs. Simons, glad of the opportunity for a rural ramble. He walked along, musing on the beauty of thetaelds and woods, hardly thinking'of the business he was upon, until he arrived at the housr, which he knew by 'the descriptionhs friend had given him. It was a small white cottage, with much shrub- bery in front, shading the little yard filled with fragrant flowers. Large branching vines clad in verdure the latticed portico that shel- tered the door. George stepped carelessly up to the front, and' rapped. An interesting looking lady of about forty years old, opened the'door, and gracefully asked him to enter. He did so, X and followed the. lady into a very finely-fur- nuished parlor. He cast his eyes around, and beheld so many evidences of good taste and- refinement, that he began to suppose he had made a mistake in the house; or, that his  friend had hoaxed him, in sending him there. He hesitated,-he knew not how to broach the subject. At length, Mrs. Simons com- menced with some general remarks on the weather, which George answered by praising the appearance of the cottage, almlost hid a- mid embowering trees, and finally said- - "I think I must have made some mistake in the lhouse; I was directed to Mrs. Simons to get some linen sewing done. Permit me to apologize for my intrusion---" "No apologies are necessary,-you were not mistaken, sir. That is my name, and I take in sewing," said the lady. "Judging from appearances," said George, "I should think this the favored abode of af- fluence and ease." "No, sir," said the lady, " you will see that it is all our own work. The carpets, hangings, &c., within doors, as well as the flowers and care of the shrubbery, are all the work -of myself and daughter." George then left his bundle, and took his leave. Mrs. Simons told him he annrl hnve)   a part of his work by Friday, and the remain- der on Monday afternoon. Bidding her a- dieu, George took his departure. On his way home, George's mind was in- tent on what Mrs. Simons had said. "She said herself and daughter," said ho to him- self "That daughter must have good taste: she must be handsome, if she resembles her mother." Thus mused George Arlington, as he pass- ed along. In vain hle strove to banish the idea foomn his mind. He pictured her form and features in his mindd- e wondered what was the color of her hair and eyes. l"I hope," said he, " she leas not red hair, or a peaked nose, or large white saucer eyes." Thus was his mind continually occupied until Friday morning. As soon as he had breakfast on that morning, lie started for the beautiful little cottage that had filled his mind the last few days past. Mr. Arlington arrived at the cottage before he was aware of it, so much was his inind cn- grossed 'with the reception he should Ineet with whenb he reached'thlere. He was receiv- ed and ushered into the little parlor as before. The widows again conversed on general topics. But Arlington was inattentive. Thlrouigh the partly open door which led to the sitting-room, Arlington could now and then hear the scis- sors fall on the table, 'or the rustling of linen, and so intent was he on this, that he heard not a word of what the old lady was saying, His mind was on the sounds that came from the adjoining room. At length seeing a picture hanging at the other end of the parlor, he walked up to it, to examine. it, thinking thereby to get a glimpse of the occupant of the other room.- But he could only see a pair of feet and an- cles past the .halfopen-door. The feet were the most beautifully-formed he had ever seen, and the close-fitting white stockings display- ed to the utmost advantage the small, well- shaped ancles. He could hardly restrain himself finom entering the room ; but the old lady called hs attention to the work she had done. She told hijn the remainder would be finished at the promised time, and she then handed him the clothes nicely done up, inti- mating thereby that he was detaining her, and that he was awaiting his departure. I3r. Ar- lington, who was well breed, could not mis- understand her. So taking the'bundle, he G C   politely left the house. After the young man -had gone, the old, lady-returned to her daugh- ter. "Well, mother, I think yon-are rather selfish." said Jane Simons, for this was the name of the occupant of the room Arlington so much desired to enter, " for you seem de- termined to monopolize the whole- of that young man's attention. You ought to sharo his visits with me." "Well, Jane," said the old lady, " upon my word, I never thought that you were lis- teningr here. I'm sure he did not hear a woiq Hsaid, but would turn his hcadlhither, at th-e least sound that came finom this room; but I little thought that his curiosity was shar'ed by you." "i You have forgotten, mother, the stories that you used to tell about the first time you saw my father, and there is no knowing what may come out of the young man's visits here. I declare, when I saw him turn-up to the house, my heart did flutter a little, and sporstimen say they can tell when a bird is wounded by his flutter. The little god, Cu- pid, has transfixed my heart with one of his arrows, perhaps." "That may be the case, Jane ; -but you had better wait till'the little god has exerci sed his skill in archery at the young man first. He may be tounger and harder to bring down than you. If you arp very deeply wounded, you will die ere an arrow can reach his har- dened heart." (' His heart may not be so hard, mother, If I am not mistaken in the sound of his voice, that index of a man, he is a superior person. However, mother, suppose that you ask him to take a seat in here, the next time he cames," "That -1.will do, Jane; for he is a very a. greeable and pleasant young man,and I sho'd like very well to have him spend an hour or so with us in social conversation, while we pursue our work." The time seemed long to Arlington; but Mtonday did at length arrive, and was as punctual as the sun. He arrived at the very ,hour, and when Jane saw him through the window at some distance, his noble carriage, and fine manly figure, shebould well say that her heart fluttered; for she could hardly han- dle her needle without endangering her 1iin gers. She movod a littlo from iEr m4otlh,   for fear the old lady would hear, her heart fift beat; for it seemed to. Jane that it was try- -tin -mg to escape from its confinement. She -was ha somewhat surprised at the unruly little thing, eh for it had always before been as quiet as a dove. She thought of what she had said at la the former visit, and she hoped her mother T had forgottenit-she would not for theworld b  have hei mother remember it now. These er thoughts, and the excitement of the occasion, of brought-the blood to Jane's usually pale face, thereby much increasing her natural beauty. vi Mr. Arlington's knock at the door-was an- swered by the old lady, and he was invited i i' RMr. Arlington,'" said the old lady, "will g you please to walk into our yworking apart-  ment, or our work-shop, and survey the ope- 1 rations- of femnle mechanics? at the same time leading the way into the room, the inte- rior of which had so long haunted Arlington's imagination.- As they entered, Jane arose, and/ the old  lady introduced her to Mr. Arlington. As their eyes met, a shower of Cupid's arrows must have been flying in the Fair, for the hearts of both were pierced to the very core in an instant. Arlington was-astonished. Thoughhe had imagined her handsome, yet the reality far surpasseed his wildest imagination. Deserip- tion cannot convey an idea of her beauty.- Her fine figure,-her full round neck ,and Shoulders,--her cheeks, whereon the rose and lily were so gracefully blended,-her dark curling hair, that hung in graceful dis- order over her neck. Join with these her- graceful carriage, and her musical voice, which sent a thrill of rapture to the heart of Arlington, and as far as language can por- tray her, and you have a picture of Jane Si- mODS. After this, Mr. Arlington was almost a dai- ly visiter at Mrs. Simons', and as there was no opposition to their union, all went well.- As soon as Mr. Arlington had obtained ad- misson to the bar, the marriage ceremony was performed. Mr. Arlington entered into copartnership with Esquire Sharp for one year, and before that time had elapsed, the old lady was taken sick and died. r. Arlington and his wife then removed to a small village on the Hudson River, about   fifty miles above New York, which, at that time, was called Shell Harbor, although it has since become quite a mercantile city, and changed its name. Arlington commenced business in the vil- lage, and did all that was to be Aone there. Thie place was small, and there was not much  business in in. it ; but he maaaged to do enough to get a good living, and would very often say to his wife-- "We will be content, and grow with the village, which, in time, will be a large place." Mr. Arlington was cut short of his calcula- ' tilons. Before they had been in their new re- sideace two years, he was laid in the cold 'grave, leaving his almost broken-hearted - wife, and a fine little daughter, to mourn his - loss. CHAPTER VII. About a morth'previous toethe death of Mr. d Arlington, two young men, brothers, by the s name of Merton, William and James, arrived atand settled in business at Shell Harbor from e England. Theyhad received from theirfather re on their departure, a thousand dollars each, and they were emulous to excel each other in d, wealth. James, the oldest, was an honest,  upright man, and a man that would deal Lp justly with all men. But William was deter- P mined to get money in any way that he could, d provided he could avoid the rigor of the law. SO James had been brought up to the mercantile Se business, and was master of his profession.-- is -William, at an early age, evinced a liking for er- the sea, and had served his time at the busi- ler ness, although he had never made himself of master of that profession, and was not capa- Or- ble of'navigating a vessel across the Atlantic  -  but he was called a good sailor before the - mast. He therefore purchased a small schoon- lai- er, and drove a good business in carrying was freight up and down the river. -  James Merton rented a small store in the ad- village, and stocked it with goods suitable for ony the market. He commenced business at a fa- vorable time, for there were then no mer- ehip., chants in the pl e, but a few shaving shops, fore as they were called. It was soon ascertained ken that he would do as he agreed, and that he dealt honorably with all alike. He rapidly ved rose in reputation and wealth. Hebought his )out goods in NwYork, payingdown part of pur-   chase m ony, and giving his note fo the bal- ance. When it bec ie due, he could send the money to take it up with, byyhis brother, whose schooner plied conktantly betweeA Shell Harbor add New York.  Jam'es, on his Arst arrival, was wholly un- acquainted with the laws of the country, and would often callon Mr. Arlington for advice. They soon became acquainted, and very much attached to each other. Every Sunday, after church was out, Mr. Merton was regularly at Mr. Arlington's. When Mr. Arlington was taken sick, Mr. Merton attended to him night and day. He followed him to his grave as a mourner, and was often heard to say he had lost the only real friend he had in America. After the death of Mr. Arlington, Merton was a friend and counsellor to the widow, and alwas told her she should not suffer solong as he had a dollar. He stillkcontinued his visits as usual on Sunday nights, and soon little Jane began to be attached to himand would f( ea cry when he left. While she was quite 1smfall, he would carry her to his store, and keep her there. a half a day at a time. The attachment proved to be contagious, for the mother took it from the child. Mr. Merton, as soon as decency would permit, proposed for the mother, and was accepted, and again the pale widow became the blooming bride. William Morton always made his brother's house his home; and was always made welcome by his brother and Mrs. Merton. He would often stop there a week at a time, when he said business was bad. One day, when Will- iam had been idle for some time, he sat upon the quarter-deck, and seemedl to be musing on something, and smiling, he said to himself, "Yes, faith, I'll do it-nobody will know it. He'll be here soon, and I'll make him the of- fer." - Scarcely had he finished speaking be- fore an Irishman stepped aboard, and con- fronting William, said- "Good morrow, Cap'n--good luck toyecr honor, and-have ye brought ver mind to bear on that bit of a trade yet? , is Yes, Jack," said Merton, "I have tho't some on that subject, and I'll tell you what I'll do. You won't want anything for a year, for you have money byyou. I'll find you to- bacco and grog, and will give you ten dollars a month, paying you at the end of the year. This is more than you asked, provided I paid every month; but I shall not be able to pay   every month, as this job of oarrying stone is not very lucrative, and the goods I shall re- ceive in payment at the end of the job, will scarcely pay the expenses. Your wages at the year's end, will be one hundred and twen- ty dollars. Shall we strike the bargain-?" "Sure, Cap'n, I'm in no want o' money, and it may as well be in your looker as mine, so long as we mess together." "Yes, Jack, yoe will be sure of your pay, as the schooner is holden to you." "Divil a bit, Cop'n, do I care about all that sort o' law. A good Cap'n and a clane runnin' schooner like this same, and divil a bit care I for the laws o' the land." ( I'm with you there, Jack. We'll make our own laws when we get out of the dirt, on a clean deck and a fair wind. Come, we'll go below and take a drop of grog, and then we'll rig up the schooner, set up the shrouds, and haul-taut the rigging that has slacked, she's been idle so long." "( I say, Cap'n, I like this same little craft, and have iver since-I made the first trip in her. She sits so proudly on the water, and then there's no vessel on the river but what she'll show her stern to in a breeze." So, a bargain was made, and Jack commenced his year's work. Captain Merton had taken a job of freight- ing a quantity of stone, and wanted a man. He had formerly hired a hand for a trip at a time, when he could not get some one to work his passage to New York. 'In such case, he sailed his vessel home alone. Jack continu- ed with Captain Merton for the year, -and at. his last trip, .when the year was up, he came home alone. He was asked about Jack, and replied, "I paid him off in New York, and he has gone to sea." "But," said a man with whom Jack had always lived when in port, " did he send a- ny word to me?" , No, not a word," said Captain Merton. "Not a word, eh?" All his clothes are at my house,.as well as his cash, papers and let- ters, and I know not what to do with them." The captain appeared in a deep study for some moments, and at length said, "I think he did say something about it; but no matter he will soon write me concerning it. What is the amount of money he left with you?" "' Just ninety-eight dollars in clean gold," was the ready reply.   Well," Lnid Captain Morton, "I am go- ing diletly back to Now York, and shiall pro- bably see him before hb sails." The Captain started again in two or thrco days for New York with another frqght, and as soon as le returned called on the mnan with whom Jaick's chest had been left. * Wll, sil," said the Captain, "I had the god luck to got in the day before Jack sailed, and he gave me this order, (produ- cre g a paer, whilh ran as follows) :-  "SIn--til will-plcaso to pay over to Cap- tain Merton/ the ninqty-eight dollars' that is,in my chest, as he has advanced the money to me, and you can keep the chest and other things until my return. ( (Sigined) # Jon, O'RILEY." "'Well. Captain," said the man, " whby did he not put in my name at the top?" "Well, -I'll tell you," said the Captain, "' I found Jack at a grog-shop, Whdere they had no writing materials, so I went away, and wrote the order which he signed.- He, did not tell me, your name, and, thinuking-it- would make no difference, I wrote it in this way." "It is all just as well," said thheman, coun- ting out the gold, which Captain Melton took and went his way. ,- A-few days after this, the Captain entered his brother's store. "James," said he, "I amn going to New York to-morrow can I do anything for you there "T' "To-morrow?" said James, " no, I have a note that will become due there next week, but I have not money now to spare to take' it up." "'o matter," said the Captain, "I can take it up. --I have money lying idle, and I had rather have the interest on it, than to have it to look at-I will pay it, as you are somewhat pressed." "Very well," said, his brother, " you can do so. Bloney is worth more than simple in- terest to me." The conversation ceased, and on the re- turn of the Captain, le showed the note to his brother, and told him when ihe wanted the money he would ask for it. Thuo busi- ne.,s pessed on between them. James would often send money by William to pay up his notes at New York, and on his retuin Le ,ould tell his brother that he had ,1"   taken up his note, and being asked for it would say, "' Oh, I thought it was of no use. and I accordingly destroyed it," "That is all right," would be James's re- . ply.     - At length James would only ask his bro- ther if he had taken up his note, and the reo-, ply would invariably be in the affirmative.-- . Two or three times in the courseiof ,their bu- siness, William took up notes with his own -money, and there ha Woull s"how his brother,. and say he would cl on him for the money when ho-wanted it.   ' Thus business went on between the broth. ers,for a nu mber of years At one time, as William was in lis roth- er's store, a young Mnan came in from the back eouitry. He talked with Juanes Mcrton about thh purchase of goods, and said he was going down after goods. He'said that he al- ways paid down for his goods, and got them cheaper, than they could be got on credit.-- William heard him through,- and then went to the dock, and hoisted his sails ready to start. Presently -the young merchant follow- ed, when he thus addressed him :- ' You said you wekt going to NowYork, did you not, siri" Ohn receiving an answer in the affirmative, he continued- "Well sir,' I am about starting fa -that place, and if the wind holds, I shalet thero before sunrise in the morning . and) this is  quicker than you can otherwise get there. I will carry you there, and bring your goods back as cheap as any other man." "How soon do you start?" said the-stran- ger ' and what is your price?" grI start itnmediately, and will carry you down for two dollars. If you send your fieight back by me, I will not charge you any fare." Tlhe passenger went on hoard of the vessel, which soon left; but he was never seen or heard of 'again. Mr. and Mrs. Merton lived perfectly hap- py, and little June, as they called Jane Ar- lington, was the idol of the whole family,- She was their only child. and Mr. Merton loved her as well as though she had been his, own child, and she knew no other father than him. He indulged her in everything. She was kept constantly at school, and excelled in all the branches of polite education every class-mate shehad. She excelled in music,    drawing and painting, besides the common branches of education. Mr. Merton often told her that she should inherit all of his property. At fifteen, Jane was a beautiful and ac- complished young lady-she had a good dis- position, and was beloved by all who knew her. She spent much of her time in' visiting . and relieving the poor and distressed. M3r. Merton always allowed her all the money she 1wished, for he would say- "'Yes, Jane, it is all yours,-do as you please with it, only do not squander it. It pleases me to see you doing good with it." When Jane was about sixteen years old, her mother was suddenly taken very sick.- Her physician told her that she must soon leave all that she held dear in this world, and that she had but a very limited time to prepare for another. Jane and her father were nearly distracted " at this intelligenc-they had not even dream- ed such an event possible. Mrs. Merton took her husband by the hand, and said- "' Oh, my dear husband, I want but a'pro- mise from:you to make me die happy. This is, that you will be to this girl the affection- ate father you have always been. You have been all that I could ask to us both-I only ask you to remain so." tI do promise, my dear wife, to be ja fa- ther to your daughter, and to watch over and protect her," sobbed the affectionate, noble- hearted Merton. '( And to you, Jane, I only have to say, be kind and affectionate to your dear father, for he has been more than a father to you, and the kindest and best of husbands to me. He took us from want and poverty, and thus far he has made us as happy as man could do in this world. Look to your father' for advice' and counsel, and obey him. You have a de- ceitful world to pass through, but you have good friends to counsel you, and leaving you in such hands, I die happy. God bless you!" After saying this, she fell back upon her pillow-she was dead. Mr. BMerton looked upon the lifeless form of that being in whom his whole spul was was wrapped up-that being whom he had loved better than the whole world beside.- He looked upon her with that silent grief that none may know without trial. He felt that the whole world was a mere blank. The   one in whom he confided his whole soul waa gone. He was grieved to that excess which prevents the flow of tears to relieve the soul's pent-up anguish. But it was not so with Jamie,-when she saw that the last vital spark was extinguish- ed, she gave a shriek, and threw herself on her mother's lifeless form, pressing her lips to those of the cold corpse. She sighed and wept until they were obliged to force her a- way, and cobnvey her to her ownxroom in a perfectly insensible state, where they watched by her side during the lnigh-t. She arose in the morning mobr composed, until she met her father in the breakfastrroom, when she threw herself in -Iis arms, and wept until her strength was completely exhausted. This excessive grief, gradually wore away, and in a few months she regained, in a meas- ure, her former equanimity. Mr. Merton and Jane were constantly in each other's compa-  ny. They seemed unhappy unless together. When Mr. Merton travelled on business, or for pleasure, Jane, was is inseparable con*, arable companion. Neither could enjofya- musement, unless the other were present. "Father," said Jane, as they were one day riding together, "I little thought, at the death of my dear mother, that we should ever again be as happy as we now are. But there is a vofd that we never can fill again." ' "No Jane," -said Mr.' Merton, " we never can be perfectly happy in this world; but I hope we shall all meet again ' where the wick. ed shall cease to trouble, and tleb weary are at rest.' Then shall we be perfectly happy. And if we could go together, I should be willing now to go. But to tell you the truth, I fear to leave you in a -world that is so full of treachery and deceit as this is. I feel that ' it will not be long ere I go to meet your mo- ther ink Paradise."  "Oh, dear father," said Jane, " speak not thus. I never could recover your loss." Poor girl! she little knew how soon she was to experience the loss of the father she so much doted upon. That night, William Merton called on his brother, to tell him that he should start in the morning for New York, and asked if he had any commands there. He was' answered in -the negative, but was asked as usual; by his t brother, to remain with him that night. HI , consenteai-and retired to bed at the usual   hour in the evening f He did not rise in the morning until the breakfast bell had rung.-- When he came down, he found his brother and Jane awaiting him in the breakfast-room, a bottle and glasses,- as was ie 'custom in those hospitable -days, stood upon the table. "Come, brother Wllia ^," said Jatnes, A' we have been waiting for you,-you look - rather pale this morning,-take a little some- thing to sharpen your appetite." "Yes," said his brother, "I don't feel very well this morning, and perhaps a little of your old Holland may stir me up-" So - saying, he stepped up to the table, and ta- king a glass, turied 'to ils brother, and said- "James, you know I always want'a little water in mine, and a little sugary" James turned away, and got a pitcher of water. While he was getting it, his brother had put sugar in both glasses-one he held in his hand-the other sat upon the table. "I have helped myself and you to sugar, James. Never take raw liquor on an empty stomach," 'They drank, and then sitting down to the table, partook of the bountiful areffistood before them.  William soon arose from the table, bade them good morning, and started for his boat, which was soon on her way to New York. Sames, as was his custom, went directly to his counting-room. Jane went to her room, and watched the little schooner as she passed rapidly down the current, until it became a mere speck on the horizon. At this moment a hurried step was heard- on the'stairs-her door opened, and the old housekeeper entered breathless with haste, exclaiming as she did so- : ' Oh, Miss Jane! come down-your fa- ther is very sick! He has come in looking so pale, it frightens me '" Jane waited to hear no more, but flew past her, and in an instant was in the presence of her father, whom she found on a sofa, andas the old woman had said, so pale that she her- self was terrified. She ran to the door, and called to a man at work in the yard, to go immediately for the doctor. The doctor soon arrived, and after examining him, said-- "Mr. Merton, if you have unsettled busi- ness that yowu ould wish to settle, you had better make haste about it, for your time on   earth is short. You have the same disease that your wife had, and it baffles all my skill. I can't do anything to help you. You will probably be in eternity before to-morrow mor-' ning."                - Mr. Merton showed no signs of fearor a- larm, but told his man to go' and get a ma- "gistrate immediately, as he wished to make his will before he died. Jane, at this intel- ligence, gasped for breath, staggered, and would- have fallen to the. floor, but, for the physician, who caught her in his arms. She was carried to her chamber, where she lay in- sensible until the following day. The magistrate came, and Mr. Merton de- liberately dictated his will Hee made Jane sole heiress to his whole estate, and appoint- ed his brother William his Executor. lio said, in his will, that his brother had some notes that he had taken up in New York for him, and some other accounts to be paid, and the balance of his property was to be paid o- ver to Jane when she married or became of' age. He next sent immediately fir his broth. er, but before-he could be overtaken and re- turn, his brother was a corpse. CHAPTER VIII.        K Whon Jane was resto'oed to her senses, she was informed of what lhad happened, a'nd merelyreplied with a caln and steady voice-- *'nThen my dear father and mother are to- gether, and happy-while I am alone, unhap- py, yes, even wretched and miserable. But God's will be done." She appeared perfectly calm and collected at the funeral, and showed not onlvya great deal of fortitude, but appeared perfectly re- signed to the sad lot which had befallen her. When the will was read, however, she attemp- ted to speak; but her powers of articulation failed her, and she was obliged to leave the room. r William Merton immediately took posses- I sion of all the property, and called upon the magistrate for the purpose of having him ex- amine his claim. "You know," said he to the magistrate, that he said I had in my possession notes which I had paid for him in New York, and other places, besides several other large de- l mands. . I  Yes," was the laconic reply.   "Very well, here are the notes-we will take each one, and cast the interest, and set it down," said Merton, as he produced a large bundle of papers. After casting up the inte- rest, and taking the sum of the whole, they found it amounted to twenty thousand dollars. The magistrate was astonished, and expressed his sv ise by making several comments on the benefits and enjoyments to be derived from possessing so enormous a sum. ' But stop!' exclaimed Merton, 'you have not seen it all yet. You must be aware of the fact that a person cannot amass such a fortune in a minute. People supposed my brother wealthy, but it was my money he had to trade upon.' Saying which, he produced a roll of shipping lists with the amount foot- ed, and the interest cast apon them, which, together, amounted to about fifteen thousand dollars. Nor did he stop here; but produced other demands to the amount of five thousand, -making in all forty thousand. They then proceeded to take an inventory of the property, putting everything down to its lowest cash value, as Mr. Merton said that the former demands were all cash demands. The whole estate, amounted to about thirty- five thousand dollars. Merton requested the magistrate to keep these proceedings secret, as he did not wish to hurt the young lady's feelings by too sud- denly exposing to her the real situation of her father's affairs. He stated that it was his o, pinion that she had had trouble enough, and that she would in all probability get married soon, if it was not universally known that she was pennyless. The magistrate merely re- plied that he ' had no anxiety to-publish it,' and left the house, not however without feel-  ing some suspicion as to whether Mr. Meiton had become rightfully and honestly possessed of his brother's property, and with the good resolution of using his utmost endeavors to - solve the matter, and find out whether his suspicions were well or ill founded. Not many days after the transaction above related, Merton was seen at a house in New York, in earnest conversation with one of its inmates. The character alluded to was a fe- male, about thirty or thirty-five years of age, dark complexion, thin compressed lips, aque- line nose, high cheek-bones, and withal very unprepossessing in her appearance. Her face, from frequent painting, and washing off, had   become very rough; and her nose' had become painted so deep acrimson that it could not be washed off unless by a long and steady appli- cation of water internally. Their confversea tion was as follows:- "If you will go with me, Mary, and stay a month, I will pay you more than you will earn here." '*Wellt"; maid she, "you have not told f' me yet what it is you require me to do. I've done enough of your dirty work already, aml if I do any more, you'll have to be a little more liberal than you have been heretofore. You are too stingy-altogether too stingy." (' I'll tell you what it is, Mary," he repli- ed, "I have a girl 't my place that must bo got out of the way, and she is so young, lovely, and innocent-besides, she has al-, ways been so kind to me, that I had rather pay something handsome than do the job my- self." "You are getting mighty scrupulous all at once. You'll be for joining the church next, I suppose," answered she, sneeringly, and in a bitter, sarcastic tone; but suddenly chan- ging her manner of speaking,- she added, "when do you want I should go?" "Immediately. I came down this trip on purpose for you, and can't return without you." "Very well;, the sooner we are off the bet- ter. I have for some tinme past been wishing, to go. I am not long in arriving at a conclu- sione when a good job is offered," rejoined she, as she proceeded with a good deal of bus- tle and confusion to make the necessary ar- rangements for her depuarture-. "As soon as you are prepared, Mary, come to the wharf-I must call at a druggist's on my way, to purchase some medicines, as we may need ome to ensure the progress of our work. I think that I had better go alone, for if we are seen together, they will be;like. ly to suspect that all is not as it should be.- I have been there alone and purchased the same article, and if I am alone now, they will think nothing of it." At Shell Harbor, on the day following that on which the above scenes transpired, Jane, while standing upon the piazza, saw her ua- cle's sloop entering the bay. She anxiously awaited his appearance at the house. She thought him-to be her friend, and the only true real friend she had. He soon entered   the mansion, accompanied by a female, who 1 - was introduced to pur heroine -as Mrs. How- i ard. Jane could not bear her bold, impudent t yet stern gaze ; therefdre, as soon as the in- troduction was over, she left the room, and wended her steps through the long hall, and numerous apartments to the one belonging to herself. Mr. Moerton entered her room soon after," and said-  "You are aware, I suppose, that I have i*harged my old housekeeper, and not be- ing able to get along without one, as I don't think you have experience ehough to manage the household affairs, besides you are not ro- bust enough, I have taken into mny service the woman you saw below." Jane turned her large lustrous eyes inqui- ringly upon him, and said- - "; Uncle, I do not like the looks of that woman. They are too bold and masculine.,' "( I think you will like her when you get acquainted with her.. She is an excellent housekeeper; and a very good nurse; so we shall not be under the necessity of calling a physician for every little trifling ache," an- Ewered he. The next morning Jane met her uncle, and Mrs Howard at the breakfast table. She tri- ed to be social, and treat Mrs. Howard as pleasantly as possible. After the meal was over, Mr. nMerton in- formed them that te was under the necessity of returning to NewYork that day, and he boped that Jane and Mrs. Howard, wouli be- come' better acquainted before he returned, and contrive to pass the time pleasantly du- ring his absence. Jane made a short reply, and-returned to ler room. A long conversation ensued between Mer- ton arid his housekeeper; but it was conduc- ted in so low a tone, that the subject of it could not be ascertained. Before ho left the house, however, X said -in a voice that was distinctly audible- "' See that you have that business aceom- plished before I return, and then I will talk of the remuneration." Jane sat at her window as usual, watching the departure of the schooner. Just as it was disappearing from her view around one of the head-lands that jutted out into the river, she heard footsteps on the stairs, anon a rap was   heard, and the customary 'walk in' brought into her apartment the said BIrs. Howard.- Jane thought, that as she was under the ne- cessity of being her companion, she would at least treat her with common civility. Shqb thereupon addressed ,Mrs. Howard thus  "' Mrs. Howard, did you-, ever watch the ,gradual recession? and finally the disappear- ance of a vessel as it glides majestically and gracefully over the smooth and polished sur- face of a liver or lake--atch it until it be- comes a mere speck, as i#'were, in the dis- tance? See how very small those sails now appear! Soon it will become blended with the hazy distance, so that -it Will not be dis- cern'ible."' The person addressed stepped to the 'window, and looking out, said- "I can scarcely see it, --your eye-sight must be extremely good, or I hardly think you would be ablejo distinguish it." "( My eyes are not as good as they former- ly were-they have become injured by ex- cessive grief, and by almost constant weeping. y life, thus far, lias been one of constant sorrow and trouble. I have seen more trou- ble, perhaps, than any other person of my age."' Jane then commenced the relation of her. history from the time of her birth up to the death of her father. She pictured those scenes of sorrow and mourning with such pa- thetic beauty, that it touched the feelings of her auditor, and- on3 more fanned that long latent spark of sympathy in the case-larden- ed soul of the old woman to a blaze. When Jane had concluded her narrative, she obser. ved the large bright tears chasing each other in quick succession down the rough cheeks of her listener. At the sight of the sympathy displayed by her auditor, Jane was so overcome that she could not refrain from throwing her arms a- round the neck of the old woman, pressed her lips to her cheeks until their tears min; gled together. At length they parted iwith. out either speaking a word. Their hearts were too full for utterance. Mary, after en- tering her own apartment, thus soliloquized  "What an errand I have come here upon! I don't wonder that he could not do it him. self-I never saw so lovely a creature in my life! I never can do the deed! It would be the most wicked thing that I was ever guilty of! Such a noble heart,-'I really love her,   and that is what t cannot say of any other being. No, if he wants the job done, he must do it himself, or get some one more wicked than I am, for I cannot do it!" Jane's footsteps'were now heard dQscend- ing the stair-way. "There," said Mary, "she is coming again to me. She loves. me. I should return that love, for I know of no one else that entertains such a feeling towards me."  Jane passed the door, and went out of the house. As she walked along, Mary looked out, and saw her graceful step and beautiful form, as she passed' over the lawn, and jealousy began to take hold of her heart, and crowd out that good principle that had so recently entered it; I am a fool," said she, "and she is a coquette. She cares no more for me than she does for a dog. It is well that I have found her out sd soon. I can now do my work cheerfully,"--sayinc which, she arose, and opening a cupboard, took from it a piece of pie, which she placed upon a plate, and lift- ing the crust, sprinkled some powder upon it-then replaced the crust so nicely, that it could not have been told that it had ever been removed. 'There,' said she, 'that will do. Apple- sauce, they say, is good to take medicine in.' She had barely time to place the pie in the cupboard, when Jane entered, with her hand- kerchief in' her hand. She walked up to the I stand, near which Mary was sitting, and o- pened her handlerchief, displaying to view some large and very nice apples. ' See, dear Mrs. Howard, what fine apples,' i said she;  'I was down street, and seein I these, bought one; but it- was so delicious 1I could not think of eating it alone, and not knowing of but one friend I had to enjoy a- c inything with me, I purchased these, and has- I toned to join you, that we might enjoy the f luscious fiuit together. Are they not fine?' '  4They are indeed very fine, Jane.' ' ' Oh! Mrs. Howard,' said Jane, ' how hap- t py I  am to have some one to associate with h gain! It recalls to my mind the happy days hat I  have spent here with my mother. I ei hink that in your company I shall soon for- M ;et my melancholy thoughts, and once more re tssume my former gaiety and liveliness. I fi ave felt happier to-day than I have before al or many weeks; but I  must go back to my u D   r work. Do,'Mrs. Howard,"as soon as you get , leisure, come to my room,'and sit there with e me. It is so pleasant to have a companion to talk with, and to disburthen one's mind to.' '- I will, dear,' she-replied, and Jane left 3 for her own room. I  - After Jane had left, Mary started to her e feet, and with a trembling hand snatched the 3 fatal piece of pie from the cupboard, and o- rt pening the stove-door, threw it into the bla- Tr zing fire, exclaiming- i  "There, that is safe. Now I can breathe freely again. Wha1t should I have done, had , she gone to the cupboard and, taken it? I [ would have arrested her hands, and have thrown myself at her feet, and then confessed it all to her. It is safe now, however, and X my next business must be to change the de- termination of Merton towards this lovely young creature. If I fail in my attempts to do so, by heavens, I will go before a magis- trate and confess the whole affair, and have him arrested-then she will not only be safe, but will receive her due. I will no w go to her room, and see if she has any s$piuions of me.' Saying which, she arose, and taking a piece of the same pie upon the same plate, proceeded to Jane's apartment. As she en- tered, she said- ' I thought that your walk might possibly have given you an appetite, so I have bro't you a piece of pie of my own make, after ha- ving eaten a part myself.' ' You are certainly kind to anticipate my wishes,' replied Jane, , I was just thinking how I should like a good piece of pie, and I am much obliged to you for your kindness.' As Mary saw the unsuspecting girl partake of the food of which the other piece would have been certain death to her, had not the giver changed her hellish design. She trem- bled for fear that some one might hereafter practice the same deception,s for she knew that AMerton would persist inperpetrating the horrid deed.  Captain Merton returned, and as he enter- ed the house, Jane met him at the door, and with her usual welcome led him into Mary's room with all her former gaiety and cheer- fulness. He first looked at Mary,- and then at Jane, with Wonder and disappointment upon hip countenance.   'Well, Mary,' said he, 'b how have you and Jane made out to get along during my absence?' Jane, without waiting for Mary to answer, turned her bright laughing eyes up to his, and said-- 'O, first rate! we have got to be the best friends in the world. We have enjoyed the company of each other very much.' eMrton looked at Mrs. Howard with anger and astonishm-ntC. Mary could not look him in the face. She feared to encounter his frow- ning, searching glance. Jane saw' that some- fling displeased her uncle, and she took the opportunity to klave the room. When Mary and Merton were left alone, the following conversation ensued:- ' How is this, Mary? Why have not my orders been obeyed? Why have you thus de- layed accomplishing the deed 3' said Merton, frowning, ani' in an anglrytone. , I placed confidence in you, and did not think you would have any qualms of conscience.' ' Mr. Merton,' said Mary, in an authorita- tive tone, 'your designs upon the young la- dy midte,not be carried into exeeution-she is too pure and perfect a being. You must alter your determlination towards her.' 'You speak as though you had ample au- thority'to dictate my affairs. Why did you undertake it, if you had no intention of car- rying it into execution?' demandel he. ' I did intend to accomplish the deed when I engaged to do so; but I have changed my mind. I should expect my limbs to be pal- sied were I to raise my finger with the inten- tion of injuring that pure, angelic creature.' ' I wonder who is getting pious now. You haven't joined the church yet, have you?' asked he, sneeringly. ' Ham getting so pious, Xr. Merton,' an- swered she, sharply, ' that not a hair of that girl's head shall be injured by you, or anybo- dy else, if it lies within my power to prevent it. That, sir, you may rely upon.' ' Whew!' exclaimed Merton, in derision, ,' if you will not do it, you ,can go back to New York as you came, and I will get some one else to do lmy business' 'You, nor none of your accomplices, shall injire her.'            , ' -Dot you intend, madam, to dictate me in my business?' cried he, his eyes flashing fire. ' How, madam, do you intend to prevent my *o   carrying into execution that which I have dc- termined shall be done?' ' I shall protect tlat girl, 'sir, as long as my own. strength is capable of doing so, and when that fails, I shall apply to the autholi- ties for assistance.' ' 3y heavens!' exclaimed be, ,' you are a- going to turn traitor, are you? If so, you will do well to consider that you may possi- bly fth a victim yourself to my cunning( ' I fear you not, wretch and murderer that you are. You are a coward. You dare not attack even a womarn that is awake, and will look yo1u in the face. You are a miserablo midnight assassin,' cried she,?gr:owing more and more furious as she proceeded, anti shep ping up to him, she shook her clenched fiit in his face. ' Hush! hush! Mary,' said he, ' you are getting altogether too warm on that sublject. What would you have me do? Give up all of my property, and beg for a living? You know that our future halppiness depends cn- tirely upon getting rid of the gilrl, and as you will not do the deed, what would you advise me to do with her?' If you wil'lthe caim, and act-likeo a man of reason, I will tell you what to do. You must devise some plan to gctle. out of tle country, and let her take cy fl ' self.-- She will find friends that w il' e-lhcr, let her go where she will.'  ! ..  'That is just what I fea, Mary;t answered Merton ; ' and sliould she get miari'ied, she will probably inform her husband of:the his- tory of her early life, and he will immciediate. ly investigate the matter, and all will bo brought to liglit.' ' You have my decision, Mr. Merton, and I am determined to adhere to what I havo- - said,'/replied Mrs. Howard, calllly. Merton sat for some time absorbed in deep meditation. At length looking up, lhe said- ' I will see what can. be done, Mary.  I will give the subject due deliberation-per- haps - there may be some way to get along vith our plan, as you propbse' : saying whirlh, he left for his own room. HHe was heard walk- ing his room several times during the night. As Jane entered the breakfast-room in the morning, for the purpose of partaking of that meal, she saw no one but Mary. Thie words of inquiry concerning her uncle had hardly escaped her lips, when he entered the apart:   wnent, holding an open letter in his hand, which he said he had received that morning. ' It concerns you, Jane,' said he, handing her the letter, whioh she took, and read as follows -        - "DEAl Sm--I feel the deepest sympathy With you, on account -of the recent-loss you have sustained in the death of your much es- teemed and nmiable brother. Your kind e- pistle announcing your bereavement in his sudden death, was duly received. He was dearly loved, as well as highly esteemed by ilthe whole of our fiamily. You wrote that he had left an adopted daughter, an orphan who was an accomplished and higly educated young lady, and that she was constantly mour- ning her recent anid severe afflictions. As the younlg lady has no companions or associates where she now is, she would confer a great favor upon us if she would colme and spend a year or more with us. We have two daugh- teors about her age, who would ble happy to render her visit as pleasant and agreeable as the circumstances would permit. Wc should be be glad to have them study music, and all thher branclies that are considered necessary for the accomplishment of fashionable ladies. According to your de6,cripDtion of your broth- er's daulghtjr:, she ,'ecapable of teaching the above brainch, and others if necessary. Do not fail to urge her to visit us, as the girls are extremely anxious she should come, and will be sadly disappointed should she not do so. "Yours, &c., . WMV. GOODPY." Jane's countenance seemed to brighten, as she read the letter. Having finished peru- sing it, she turned to Mr. Merton, and said- ' Well, uncle, what do you tlink of my complying withl this gentlenman's wishes, and accepting his offer" ' I should advise you, Jane, to embrace the opportunity now offered, and accept the very kind proposition that Mr. Goodpy has seen fit to make you. You have no associates here, and you would pass your time   more pleasantly-besides, it would be of great ben- efit to you in many other respects. The jour ney will not only be agreeable, -b-t it will be advantageous to your health to inhale the pure country air.' '-I shall take your advice, uncle; for I feel confident that you would not advise me wrong,' replied she.   The necessary arrangements were soon completed, and Miss Jane Arlington embar- ked on board a steamer for the north. 3  You are already aware that she arrived at her place of destination in safety, as it was there, dear reader, that you were first made acquainted with her-also, of the reception L she met with at the town of 0C CHAPTER IX. Mr. Merton closed up his house, and took his associate 'on board the schooner to assist him, as he did not dare to trust any one else with his soul-damning secrets. They contin- ued' to coast up and down the river about a month. Within this time, a young man made his appearance at Shell Harbor, and put up at the principal hotel in the village. The gos- sips of the village were greatly troubled to ascertain who the stranger 'was-where he canme from, and what his business was in the village. But his silence and monosyllabic an- swers, when addressed, only increased their curiosity. . The young man's object was to find out and get into conversation with Cap- tain Merton, whom Jane had described to hiln, for the mysterious stranger was none other than Mr. Barton, with whom the read- er is already partially acquainted. lBarton, on the third day after his arrival, sat at the door of his hotel, and watched with eagerness the appearance of a schooner that coming up the river in the distance. * There comes Merton's schooner,' said a man, pointing at it, ' I wonder if he keeps his sailor yet. That Merton is as rich as a Jew, and -has neither chick nor child to leave his property to, and yet he works night and day like a slave. They do say, he cheated a little gill out of some money her father left her when he died. He wa'n't herfather, nei- ther, but she called him so.'   'f Barton listened to the man's story with ea- ger attention, appearing, however, not to no- tice a word he had said. The schooner came up, and was fastened to the dock. A man and woman of middle age were all that ap. peared on deck. After the sails were all low. ered and secured to their booms, and every piece of rope nicely co6iled, and everything put in its place, they both disappeared in the cabin. Barton, after a leisurely, and circuitous   walk, came to the dock, and carelessly step- ped on board of the schooner. The Captain hearing a-footstep, came upon deck, and the young man carelessly asked him where he was bound. Being answered to New York, and that she would sail on the following eve nipg, he seemed satisfied. J '.-Would you like to take a passage, sir?' said Captain Merton, ' she is a good sailor- good accomodations in the cabin. The freight will be clean-a cargo of cabinet furniture iti the hold-decks all clear.' ' I must go to-morrow,' said Barton, walk- ing away. Barton's mind was made up. He had noticed a door leading from the hold to the cabin, by means of which all conversation in the cabin might be overheard. He retur- ned to the hotel, and the next day kept his room all day, but watched the progress of the schooner's loading. As soon as it was dark, Barton, in a diffe- rent dress, with pistols concealed in his breast well charged, took his way to the dock, where he hid behind a pile of lumber. He watch- ed Merton's preparations, who, when all rea- dy, cried out, ' Come, Mary, help me get un- der way -let's hoist the sails,and be off.' Hold. on, William,' came the answer from the. cabin, ' supper- is ready, so come down and eoat it before we leave the dock--I hate to always eat alone.' 'I am afraid that our passenger will be tired of waiting, and our trip would hardly pay, if he should not come with us.' As Merton finished, he disappeared in the cabin. He was no sooner out of sight, than Barton threw himself over the gangwale of the schooner, as noiseless as a cat, and disap- peared down the hatchway. He soon heard the bustle on deck, consequent on getting a vessel under way. Taking advantage of the noise on deck, he groped his way along the dark passage, over the furniture that was pi- led in {he hold, until he found himself at the door between the cabin and hold. He fixed himself quite comfortably, and then laid down. ' Here,' said Barton to himself, ' I can hear all their conversation, and I shall be well paid for my trouble. The risk I run, I shall consider as nothing, provided I can detect the-fraud that has been practiced upon that  noble girl.' We will now, with the consent of the read- er, leave Barton in his unpleasant predica-   ment, while we retrograde, and explain to the reader the motives of his actions, as shown in his prior history. I About thirty years previous to the comn. * mencement of our story, a young man by the name of George Sinclair, was married in a %nall town in (range County, in the State of Vermont, to a young lady by the name of Henrietta Barton. Mr. Sinclair had a small property left him by tihis father, to which ho had niade some ad- dition previous to his marriage. After his his marriage, he entered into the mercantile business, and nearly doubled his property ev- ery year, so that in a few years he was quite independent., About two years after his mar- ringe, his amiable wife presented hin with an heir, who was namredGeorge, after his father. George, at the early age of seven years, was ' sent away fiOom home to a High School, to fit for College. At the age of ten years, he had the misfortune to lose his mother, an e- vent which caused the little student to shed many tears, for hie dearly loved his kind and affectionate mother. When George arrived at the age of eigh- teen, he entered College. About this time, his faoler was married to an olrd aid that had, for many years, taught the villagre school, and who had the reputation of being a fine woman, with an excellent disposition, and a very superior education. George was sent for to attend the wedding. He was very glad to see his old teacher, and her heart was glad- dened by the long wished-for appellation of mother from Georgej as he saluted her with a kiss.  George again returned to his studies, and Mr. Sinclair to his business. All went on smooth and clean for a couple of years ; but then a storm  began to arise, to dispel the, blessed sunshine of happiness. Jealousy, the destroyer of all peace, and the agent of misery and disorder, crept, uncalled-for, into that formerly happy family. Mrs. Sinclair began to see that her ihusband was anticipating greatly on the future figure his son was to mnake in the world, and began to see that she must take measures to lower the young man in his father's estimation, or her plans as to the disposal of the property would fail. At the annual vacation of College, George came home, and, as usual, remained there   until the commencement of the next term,- His father, as usual, on his departure, gave him a liberal supply of money. The next day, lMrr. Sinclair went to his desk, the key of which he always kept at the head of his bed. He found his key had been mo- ved, his desk opened, and two hundred dol- lars in money taken from it. He asked his wife if any one had been in the oom since George had left, for he had rema ied in this room to watch for the stage, some tTie before his departure. Mr. Sinclair was in sone doubt as to the money-he could not believe that George had taken it, as he had always given him all that he asked for, and he had never known of his going to his desk, unless he was sent. But this matter was soon forgotten by Mr. Sinclair, and affairs went on as usual. George came home at the next vacation, and nothing was said to him of the rifling of his father's desk. On his departure, Mr. Sin- clair again missed money to double the am't \of the former abstraction. He thought, as s. Sinclair said, that lie could go deeper, anr1'all would be right. a. Sinclair's first thought was to follow and sop him, and ascertain if he had more. money than he gave himn,  But he could not bring lais mind to think that his son w^ould be guilty/of so vile a deed, and finally he let it pass. About three months aftcr this, sMr. Sin- clair's desk was opened agtain, and a thousand  dollars taken fromn it. Mr. Sinclair went to his wife, and told her of his loss. ' You-can't lay this to George,' said he, ' for he is absent. How will you account for this?' ' You shall see, sir,' said his wife, ' how I will account for it. Read this.' As she spoke, she handed hin  a letter directed to a hi- red girl that blad long lived in the fam- ily, and was known to b6 a great fiavorite of George. It was in George's hand-writing, and ran thus :- "DEAR LUCY--You and'I have been for a long time the best of friends, and I now re- quire a proof of your friendship.  I have got into trouble, and am in a desperate strait for money . I hate to ask my father for it, altho' I know he would give it to me. I am in debt between six and seven hundred dollars-debts of honor, for I lost the money by play. I   must pay these, and my father must not know it. .Now, Lucy, you must go into his bed. room, get the key of his desk, which hangs on a nail at the head of his bed, unlock the desk, and get me -one thousand dollars out of the right-bhand drawer, and send it to me.- Father will not tniss it, for I have twice ta. ken money in the same way, and he never missed it. Send it on immediately. "Yours,    GEOROE SINCLAIR.^ After-finishing the perusal of the letter, M1r. Sinclair said to his wife---, ' This letter is in George's hand-Writing, and it is his-signature; but how came it in your possession?' ' I found it in Lucy's work-box,' was the reply. Lucy was immediately called in, and queas tioned by Mr. Sinclair. Lucy, where did you get this letter?' said he, holding it out to her. She attempted to take it, but he withdrew it, and continued, ' I wish you to tell me how you came by that letter, and if you have answered it?' Lucy blushing deeply, said, ' I don't know sir, as I ever saw it before. Let me see it, and I'll tell you if I know where it came from. ' ' I know very well where it came from,' said Mr. Sinclair, '.but I want you to ex- plain how it came into your possession.' ' I don't know, sir, as it was ever in my -possession,' said the girl, very much fright- ened at RMr. Sinclair's glaring eyes a nd anx- ious appearance. ' If you don't know,' said he, ' I'll try to ascertain that fact myself; you can go to your .work.' Mr. Sinclair sent a man directly to the Col- legef with a line to the President, stating that he wished his son to come home imme- diately.      4 The next day George made'his appearance. He stepped out of the carriage and ran in, expecting to meet his father -at the door, as usual ; but not seeing him, he ran directly into his room to ascertain the cause of his be- ing called so abruptly home. As he entered th 'rooln, he saw his father seated on the op- posite side of the room, pale and dejected.- As his eyes turned on George, they seemed to flash like those of a Demon. George ran to him, and attempted to take his hand, but it was immediately withdrawn.   '-My dear father, cried he, ' what is tho matter-what have I done, thus to provoke your anger towards me. -Speak, father! do speak, and say what have I done, to merit your displeasure.  Mr. Sinclair looked him in the face-held up the letter, and asked, ' did you write that letter?' George looked at the superscription, and said- ' It looks like my writing; b-ut I never wrote a letter to that girl. Show-me the let- '  ter,' said George, and if I wrote it, I will not deny it.' Sosaying, he took the letter, read it, and examined t he signature, and theri handed it back to his father, saying-   / 'Father, I never wrote that letter, but some one that can counterfeit my hand did. I can hardly detect the imposture myself.' ' My son,' said the father, ' did you never see that letter before? Are those statements false?' ' So help me God,father, I never did. Those statements are false.' '  I. helye you, my son,' said the father,. Olasping hiin his his , a nd weeping like a - hild. ,George,' said he, after a pause, thllis has been done by some enermy of yours to in- jure you;. but all will conme to light in time. 'Say nothing, and return to your studies, for I am  restored to happiness once more. I would not experience the same feelings I did 'on youi-arrival, again, for the whole world.' George returned to Collcge, and all was a- gain restored to tranquillity. A  few monthls after this, Mr. Sinclair re- ceived a letter-from the post-office, mailed at the town where George resided. It ran as fol- lows:-   . "Mr. Sinclair-Dear Sir, -Being an old friend ofyours, I deem it my duty to acquaint you with a secret which it is necessary you lshould know,  but which will nearly break your heart.  Your son is constantly with a ,gang of gamblers, losing large sums every night. He must get it dishonestly, for he lo- ses enormous sums.  I have tried to reason with him,  but it is all to no purpose. The writer of this has the misfortune to be con- nected ;with that gang, but having received a great favor from- your hands formerly, he wishes to repay it, by reforming your son, and snatching-him from perdition. You had   3 best look to your bankers and the deposlto. 3 ries of your money, and see that all is righlt. ) You need not endeavor to/asecrtain who tho t writer of this is, -as all thqulry will be vain. ' I remain your sincere friend' I      ;"And well-rwisher, --- - t  After reading the 'above etter, Mr. Sinclair went directly to the bank, where nearly all I his money was deposited, to see that all was correct. To his utter astonishment, he found tha tthrlee thousand dollars had been drawn out on forged drafts. On examination, tlo drafts seemed to be inthe hand-writing of his son. After ascertaining this, Mr. Sinclair became entirely outrageous.. He raved and cursed his son, and hmself for not believing the first evidence of his guilt. He sent for George to come home. George, on his arrival, ran up to his father, and. said, 'Dear father, what can be the causo of all this excitement?' ' Scoundrel!' said his flther, 'don't call mo by that name--I am not your father: you are a vile thief, a forger mand a villain. Be gone frOiop my sighllt, anld 'ever more approacl me. Miy curse be upon you!' Georfge fell on his knees at his father's feet, and said, O0 curse me not, fatlher,' with an imploring and( suppliant air, ( I am innocent: I amn guiltless of those crimes you cllarge me with. ) ' Be gone, liar!' said the old man; and hle threw  his son prostrates the carpet with his foot. George  arose, indignant and grieved at the treatment he had received, and wipin the tears'firom his eyes, he retreated a pace. 'Be gone!' continuyd  the infmriated old man, ' and never again let me behold your lying countenance. Never presume to write to m'e, or call me father. I disown you, and forbid your bearing  my name. Quit this place immediately, and never i'cturn, or you shall be sent to prison to expiate the crimnes you have committed.' ' Dear father, will you for one moment lis- ten to reason?' said Georgc,  in a supplica-  ting tone. ' I tell you, villain, not to call me father. I am not your father. Go, vile wretch; and may my heaviest curse forever rest upon you. Never speak to me again, or I swear by the God that made me, I will have you arrested. I have proof sufficient to condemn you to thhe   State Prison for life. And unless you imme- diatcely leave my house, you shall feel the ri- - gor of the law.' George saw the determination of his father, and he dared not attempt a reconciliation.- He gathered a few articles of clothing, &c., : that belonged to him, and hastily left the b house, not knowing where he was going to. As he walked away fromn Iis place of nativi- , ty-from the house where he first drew the breath of life-wnhere he had often, in his childhood, laid his aching head on. the breast of a kind and affectionate mother, .and where a'lind and gentle fatter had so often cares- sed him. His young heart was ready to break: it was the fiist time he had ever k;nown trou- ble. -He would have thrown himself into the river, but a thought came over him that seem- e d to raise his broken and drooping spirits. 'ly father,' said he to himself, -' will some day ascertain the. truth of this matter, and recall me to that home I am now forced to leave. And oh! once more to Ib kindly greetcl by that dear fatlher! This would be perfect happiness. My father is not to blame, for were 1 the vile wretch lie has every rea- son to suppose I am,. I shouldl richly merit the treatment I now receive. But it is hard to be accused, and then forbidden to assert my innocence. I will go and gain for myself a name and reputation that my father will one day glory in saying, ' That is my son."' Thus musing, lie walked along, not evon thinking where 'he was going. Night came on, but he scarce noticed its approach. He thought not of fatigue or hunger; but contin- uedr to travel util neall morning, when he came to Lake Champlain.  He walked on to the dock and sat down, and soon unconscious- ly fell into a sound sleep, fi'om which he did a ot awake until he was aroused by an uncom- aon bustle around him. He started up-it as bload day-light--a steamboat lay at the Iharf, anld the people were passing  off and in haste. He started, without thinking what he was Hoing, snatched up his valise, and hurried ith the rest of the people on board the boat. i  he steamer soon left the dock, and our hle- ps   o ps,oceded to the cabin, and seeking a ;umch, retired to rest.  He was aroused by :  e sound of a bell, and starting up, was told !4  call at the captain's office and settle.- ither ho proceeded.;  i:   ' Where do you wish"to land, sir VP ' I want to go to New York.' ' You are going, the wrong way. We are going north.' ' No mlatter-perhaps it will be as well for me to go north; I wish to get into business s a clerk, and perhaps I shall do as well north as s quth.'-- ' You wish to get a situation as a clerk, do you? Well sir, I want to engage a young man as a clerk on board the boat. Perhaps you would like the situation.' ' I should, sir, if we can agree on the terms.' ' What is your name, sir?'- ' My name is George---' at this moment he thought of his father's Finunction not to call himself Sinclair, and he had not thought of any name he could take. He hesitated and blushed deeply. The astonishment with which the captain surveyed him, confused him still more. ' What!' .said the captain, ' do you not know your own name? It is very singular that a mau should forget his own name/ . 'MyT name is George--George-Barton,' he said, thinking of his mother's name. He was so embarrassed that the captain laugh- ingly replied- ' I think it will not be best to hire a mawt for a clerk, who is so absent-minded as to for-- get his own name. He might forget to eat when he was hungry, and thus die of star- vation.' George felt that he had made a very awk- ward appearance, and a's he could not very well explain the cause of his hesibttion, he: thought it best to let the conversation drop. He paid his fare accordingly, and said no more on the subject. He saw that he had lost a good situation, by not having, his plans matured, So, during- the remainder of his trip, he occupied himself in forming plan$, for his guidance in future life. George landed at the village of - '. where he engaged as a clerk to Mr. Prim, in that gentleman's store where the reader first made his acquaintance. CHAPTER X. We will now return to our hero, whom we left on board of Captain Merton's schooner. Whilst the schooner was getting under way, Barton was employed in enlarging a crack in   the door with his knife, so that he could look into the cabin and observe what might be go. ing on in there during the trip. He soon as- certained that the vessel was under way by, hearing the gentle rippling o' the water un- der her prow and along her sides as she clear- ea her way through the yielding element. The woman soon made- her appearance in the cabin--she was busy making some prepa- rations, when conversation commenced be- tween her and some person on the deck, show- ing Barton that a trap-door had been opened from the deck; so that the-man at the helmn could see and converse with the person in the cabin. ,  ' I say, Mary,' said the man in a low tone, 'see that all the necessary preparations are made in the cabin for our passenger. See that everything is so arranged that he will not sus- pect anything. Be quick about it too, for we are fast nearing the wharf.' Barton immediately suspected that some' foul play was meditated against the passen- ger. He raised himself so as to see into the cabin. The rug appeared to be covered in spots with blood that was not yet dry. The man at the helm called out in a low voice, ' Be careful there, Mary, and not get the blood on the floor, for we sha'n't have time to clean it up before we get to the wharf.-- See if the point of that rib-tickler ain't broke. I thought the last time we used it it was ra- ther hard.' The woman went to another locker and took from it a long Spanish dirk, the handle of, iwich was covered with a hard, dry en- crustation of blood. Having felt the point, qhe- answered as follows:- The-point is as sharp as a needle ; but you are not a good surgeon, or you would take better care of your instruments. You didn't as much as wipe your tooth-pick after using it last.' ' It is your duty to wash the dishes, if I have to carve the meat,' answered he, with a demoniacal smile playing around his lips. Soon the schooner came alongside of the dock, and the man who had been engaged in- the above conversation went ashore, and step- ping up to a gentleman on the wharf, said- ' Are you ready, sir? We  are somewhat behind our time, but will make up before morning, if possible.' Receiving a reply in the affirmativebe car*   ried the stranger's baggage aboard, and they were once more wending their way over the waters of the majestic Hudson. The stran. get, immediately after coming aboard, pro- ceeded to the caSbin. When all was still, Barton raised himself again, and looked into the cabin. A well-dresc sed, finely-proportioned man, sat at the table, reading a newspaper. He sat partly side.  ways to Barton, so that he could only see his back, and a part of one side of his face. Ho closely watched the reader in hopes of getting a full view of his features, for there was some. thing familiar to Barton in the features of the stranger, which he could in no way account for. He watched until becoming fatigued by remaining so long in the uneasy position, he was obliged to sit down. Still anxious, how- ever, to:know what was going on on deck, ,he crawled forward to the hatchway, which still remained open, and saw that it was so dark withiout, that an object was not discer- nible half way across the deck. This being favorable, he lightly raised himself upon the deck, and beheld the figures of two persons earnestly engaged in conversation upon the quarter-deck. He softly stole along until he was within a few feet of them, when he heard the man say in a whisper-  ' Go you to the cabin, Mary, and see if he mistrusts anything.' The woman went to a small hole in the deck over the cabin, and placing her eye to it, lay silently gazing within for a long tilne: at length, cautiously rising, she approached her companion, and said-      4 ' He has turned in. He looked as uncon- ce'rned as a man going to 3hurch. I hope he said his prayers before he turned in, for he'll be in too much of a hurry, I think, when he gets up.'  ' Go down, Mary,' replikd the man to her quietly, ' and see if he is asleep. If so, ar- range dverything that is necessary, and then return and take the helm, and I'll go down  for, the sooner we get through, the better.- It is already past midnight, and it will take till morning to clean up the blood.' Barton was by this time fully satisfied what were the intentions of the conspirators towards the stranger.  He quietly stole towards the hatchway, and letting himself down, resulmed his old station. He saw thb old woman draw the curtains of the berth gently one side, to   ?/e if their unsuspecting victim was soundly 'iriapped in the arms of Morpheus. Having :itfied herself upon that point, she spread ?;ie rug we have before spoken of near the [earth: she then layed the dirk upon the ta- R Ile, and left the cabin. As she had disap- i/ eared, Barton unfastened the door, and with i pistol in one handk and the other upon the oor, e stood awaiting the appearance of the i complice. A door opposite the one by ghich he stood, opened. He entered cautious- ?ly, looking around him to see if he was ob- Xserved. He advanced to the table, and ta- lking the dirk, felt the edge. He stepped to ithe bed, drew aside the curtain, and raised the murderous weapon to strike the fatal it blow. /i H' Hold, ruffian . cried Barton, as he sprang from his place of concealment, and at the same l time the sharp crack of a pistol rang through the cabin, and the right arm of the assassin fell useless by his side. The sleeping victim, , awoke by the report of the pistol, sprang from I his berth in time to see the weapon fall from I the murderer's band. Snatching it with his i remaining hand, however, he aimed a blow ? at Barton, which he parried with his pistol, a and then hurled him to the floor. Seizing a I cord that lay near him, Barton proceeded to bind the guilty wretch. Mary, alarmed by the outcry, softly stole into the cabin. Her eyo caught the dirk which was lying upon the  floor by the conqueror and the vanquished. !She cautiously approached them, and picking !tit up, prepared to plunge it into Barton, !when her arm was arrested by the stranger, who, darting forward, wrenched the bloody, [ steel from her grasp, and secured her by the :/ame cord to the Captain. After they had secured the murderers, the two men turned, and looked each other in the face for the first time during the perfor- mance of the tragedy. The elder of the two immediately exclaimed-- I My God    My deliverer! My son! My ong-lost son!' H  The young man was about to exclaim in eturn, ' My father!' when he suddenly re- ollected that he was forbidden to call him that endearing name. His father divining its were his thoughts, exclaimed- H  'Oh, George! call me by that blessed name. i!nce more let my heart be cheered by the !  :ound of that affectionate title. I have been HA  .      '   miserable ever since that accursed day. All has come to light,-I know your innocence. 'Dear father!' cried George, weeping, and overcome by his emotion, he'was obliged to lean upon his parent, 'dear father, this is the day I have so long wished for. I am now happy enough to atone for all that I have suffered,' ' Forgive me, my dear, dear son,' said his father, ' I have suffered enough to atone for my rash conduct towards you. Forgive, and I am happy.'  (I have nothing to forgive. I never accu- sed you of doing wrong. I heard you had been deceived by some one; but who, I can- not tell. I don't know that I have ever giv- en any once cause for offence, nor was I till then aware that I had anenemy.' 'My son,' said the father, ' it was one who bad no cause to be your enemy: avarice : did the deed. The hope of gain was the on- ly cause of all our misfortunes and troubles. Your mother was taken sick about six months after you left, and the physician soon pro- noutncedi her case to be incurable. She ap- peared in great distress of mind for some days. The day before she died, she called me to her bed-side and said- ' My dear husband, I have suffered moro than you can imagine. It is not the fear of death, but the distress of a guilty conscience that has caused me more pain than death it self. I will relate to you my guilt, and then if you will forgive me, and pray to God to forgive me likewise, I shall die happy. In the first place, I am the cause of all the trou- ble you have suffered in relation to your son. I took the money that was laid to him. I wrote the letter to the girl, and took the mo- ney at that time; and I wrote the letter ac- cusing him of gambling. Lastly, I forged the drafts on the tnk--dressed myself in a suit of his clothes, and went to the bank and obtained the money. -All this was for the special purpose of enraging you against that innocent boy, so that you would desert him, and I would then stand a better chance of in- heriting your property. Now that you know the whole, if you can forgive me, I shall die more happy than I have lived since that adc cursed transaction. The money that you sup- posed had been squandered, by your son, is in my possession, and at-your disposal.' ( I told her that I could freely forgive her.   She wished me to search for you, and if I found you, to tell you her confession, and beg of you in her name, to pray that lher guil- ty soul might be forgiven.' I I am sure, dear father,' answered George, ' that this was all designed by an all-wise Providence to bring about' the very object that I am now in pursuit of. That object, you shall know some future day.' At this moment a shock was felt in the cab- in, and the voices on deck announced to the people on board that they were boarded by soyhe other vessel. The two men went on deck, and were thus accosted by those who had boarded them :- ' Do you command this vessel, sir?' ask- ed one who appeared to be their captain. ' I do at present,' was the reply; 'I took possession of her to-night.' ' Well, you are a green 'un to let a vessel drive before the wind in this way. We have been watching her motions for the last two hours, and came to the conclusion that all on board must be drunk or asleep, by the movements.' After the schooner had been lashed to the, other vessel, and all made safe, our two tra- vellers related the adventures of the night. ' There, Bill,' said one of the sailors, 'that's what ] always told you of that old d-1-l, and his Qld hag that sails with him-- There has bee, several passengers missed from that craft before to-day.' The two vebels were soon at the wharf at the city, and ttprisoners having been delivered over to the proper authorities, were taken to prison. At a regular session of the Supreme Court in the city of New York, the court being cal- led by the clerk, and the preliminary busi- ness of opening gone through with, the Judge said, ' Let the Sheriff bring in the prisoner.' The Sheriff disappeared, and soon returned, leading a middle-aged man, stout built, of rather a bold and indifferent appearance, in- to the court. He was placed at the bar.- The clerk arose, and proceeded to read the indictment, as follows :-- ' William Merton, you are indicted before this court for the several murders of Jack 0'- Rilcy, James Merton; his wife, and three stranger passengers, on board your schooner, at three several times. To these several in- dictments do you plead guilty, or not guilty?'   The prisoner, with a bold look, and clear, full voice, said, 'I am not guilty of any of the crimes that have beend reclared in this indictment.' The Judge then said, ' The Sheriff will bring forward the witness.' The Sheriff en- tered the court with a female of a bold and daring appearance. As the witness took the stand, the face of the prisoner became in an instant as white as marble, and large drops of perspiration stood upon his forehead. He drew his hind across his eyes to be certain that they did not deceive him, and said in a low voice, ' I'm gone! That d---1 has be- trayed me! A curse on her, and on all of that class of women! A man is never safe that has anything to do with them!' The witness being sworn, the Judge ask- ed her name. ' Mary Howard,' said she. 'Well, Mary Howard, tell the jury what you know of the prisoner at the bar, and what you know of the murders he is charged with.' ' I first became acquainted with the pris- oner about two years ago,' answered the wit- ness. ' He was in the habit of coming to my house, and became quite familiar with me and' the girls. About six months ago, he came to my house, and said he had a job to be done, and that he would pay me well if I would do it. He said there was a young lady at his house, that was heiress to a great estate,- and and she was the last of the race, and if he could get her out of the way, the property would fall to him, and that if I would assist him, he would pay me well. He said he had drugged her father and mother to get them out of the way. I consented, but when I saw the girl, she was so young and lovely, that I recanted the bargain, and he sent her away. I then went with him on board his schooner, and saw him murder three men at different trips. He got a large amount of money from them. He told me of several other murders he had committed. That is all I know.' The Judge then arose and said, ' I think the jury can decide without leaving their seats. There can be no doubt of the prisoner's guilt.' The jury, after a few moments of consultation in their seats, returned a verdict of ' Guilty.' The Judge passed the sentence of death. The prisoner said he wished to make one statement to the world, before the sentence passed on him was carried into oxecution.- t   It was, that all the property he had then in his possession, of right belonged to a young lady by the name of JANE ARLINGTON. As the name was pronounced, a young man in one of the back seats arose, and sprang to- wards the prisoner, and would have embra- ced him in his excitement, had it not been for the Sheriff, who stopped him. The young man was none other than Mr. Barton. He obtained permission of the Judge to converse with the prisoner, which he did in a low tone, and for a long time : when he arose, he shook him warmly by the hand, and bidding him a last farewell, left the court in company with his father. The next morning, Wm. Merton was found dead in his cell. Hte had poisoned himself with a drug, and had kept it secreted for the purpose, when considered by him as neces- iary. CHAPTER XI. We shall now, with the reader's permis- sion, return to Doctor Cole and his fair pa- tient. Doctor Cole's father was a farmer in the northern part of the Empire State. He had acquired, by industry, a handsome prop- aty; and about the time that the Doctor gain- ed his diploma, and was admitted to the prac- tice of medicine, his father died, leaving the Doctor his property to support himself and his widowed mother. The Doctor's farm was in a retired place. The place was pretty close- ly settled, but the inhabitants were nearly all farmers. The Doctor did all the" business in his line that there was to be done. He arri- ved at his mother's residence with his patient about dark of the day they had started from the village where Jane was taken sick. The fatigue of the journey had nearly ex- hausted all Jane's remaining strength. She arrived pale and weak, and could scarcely even with the Doctor's assistance walk into the house. The Doctor's mother met them at the door. 'Mother,' said the Dpetor, ' allow me to introduce you to Miss Arlington, a young la- dy upon whom I have been attending. She was amongstrangers, and I thought it better to fetch her home, where she could have good care. I knew you would willingly assist an orphan in distress.' (I am,'aid Jane, ' really a poor orphan;   but I hope to see the time I can repay this kindness.' 'I shall be happy, Miss Arlington,' said the old lady, ' to render you as comfortable as it is my power to do.' ' All the young lady now wants, mother,' said the Doctor, ' is recruiting her strength a little. Her disease has left her, but she is quite feeble, and I think our combined skill and care will soon restore her to health and cheerfulness.' In a few days Jane began to recover, and in two weeks she had become so strong that she walked all about the country.' ' Jane,' said the Doctor one fine afternoon, ' did you ever go a fishing? There is a fine place down back of the meadow to fish as I ever saw. I will go down with you this af- ternoon, and instruct you in the ' gentle craft,' as that enthusiastic angler, Jack Waldon, terms it. How like you the plan?' ' I should like some trout, said the old la- dy-we have had none since Jack left, and he used to catch them only on rainy days.' Jane hesitated for a moment, and then said- ' I fear you would have a hard task to learn me. I never caught any, nor have I ever seen any caught. But it will be a pleasant way of passing the time, and I should enjoy it much.' The fishing apparatus was soon prepared, and Jane, with the Doctor, started across the meadow. The path led them to a large rock that projected into the little stream, where seats had been fixed by Jack. The place was little frequented, and there was an abundance of the finny tribe. The hooks were baited and thrown in. ' Oh! see, see! Doctor,' said Jane, 'what makes my line run up and down so?' ' You have a fish, Jane,' said the Doctor, ' pull him out.' Jane pulled up her hook, and landed a fine trout on the bank, which the Doctor took off, and fresh baited the hook, sayig- 'Well, Jane, you have already yourself acquired the lesson I was going to teach you.' She had scarcely thrown in her hook again, ere she had another speckled gentleman floun- dering on the shore. Jane's good luck exci- ted her so much that she could hardly wait for the Doctor to disengage the fish, and re- place the bait. The pleasurable excitement ^        :   Otf the new sjport, brought back the healthy flushh of her cheek, and the parklin, glanee of hor bright eye went like electricity to the heart of the Doctor. ' Oh, Doctor!' said Jane, ' this is the ra- rest sport I ever'knew--I should never tire of it.' For some moments the Doctor had looked into her face. He -had thought of nothing but the pure loveliness that beamed from those sparkling orbs. Jane's speech recalled him to himself, buat he could en-lure it no longer. He threw himselfat aher feet-seiz- ed her lily whith hand with both of his-look- ed inmplorifhgly in her face, and, with a voice trembling with' emotion, said- ' Oh, Jane! with these fishing grounds- these lands, and all that I possess, accept my hleart and hand. Speak but one word, and render me happy forever. I shall never know happiness, unless you grant my requaest.' The rose in a moment forsook her cheek- she became as pale as marble--her enjoy- ment had all fled-she hardly knew what an- swer to malke. She'featred being again thrown on to the cold-hearted world. It had been her misfortune to be cast into misery the moment she thouglt her happiness full. ' I will tell himin,' she thhoug lt, 'the whole truth. Doctor,' continued she, aloud, 'you make me unhappy.  I must tell you the truth. lMy liandiand heart are not at my own dispo- sal. They were pledged to another betfore I lnad the bappliness to become acquainted with you.' The, Doctor's. countenance underwe lrnt in instant ehangye-a dark stowl seemzed to take thel place of the soft kind expression in the eyo. Thlen,' said Ihe, 'oI am doomedl to see the onlly being on earthl that 'love, enjoyed by :inother*. Wilhere is that happy man, and why hlas hle left you in trouble t' That.,' said Jane, ' I can hardly answer myself; but when hlo left meo, I was in good cirem'st'inees, and by the treachery and falseo- hoold of a jealous woman, I was turned into tho streets to beg or starve. He may be dead, or somwhmiskfor'tuo may have botefallen hi.- I expected him back long before this, but if ho does not return in thee months, I shall givo up all hopos of his ever returnling. At this stwtetueltl the countenance of the Doctor again brihtonoed.   My dear Jane,' Did he, ' if he returns not in three months Jil you, at the expirae. tion of that time, lbcome my bride?' Jane being so situated that she dared not  refuse, said-- ' I will, Doctor, if I see nothing in your character before that time to change my de- termination.' II seized her hand, and eagerly pressed it to his lips, and with his eyes full of liquid love, said- Then dear Jane, I shall be happy in hope. ful anticipation for a time, revelling in the delightful visions of hope.' For two or three weeks Jane and the Doc- tor were every day at the front Rock, as the place was called. The Doctor was always with her, unless called away by business, in which ease he rejoined her as soon as possi- ble. Jane's constant fisiing procured more trout than the little family could make use of, and on her return home, Jane usually ,called and left a string of fish at a poor wid- ow's, whom she occasionally visited. One day, Jane was returning alone with a fine large string of trout, which she intend- ed to give to the poor widow. As she came into the main road that led to the house, a gentleman in a carriage came up with her, and said- ' You have a fine string of fish there, my sweet girl. Will you sell them?' ' NO, sir,' said Jane, ' I catch fish for sport, and hot for gain.' ' I will give you a good price for them, Miss,' said he. Jane handed them to him, saying, ' I will make you a present of them, if you will ac- cept themu.' The man took thlem, and throwing her a silver dollar, said, ' I accept your present, and you must mine.' He drove rapidly off. Jane looked at the money and pocketed it, thinking, ' time may be when this will serve me.' Some time previous to this, the Doctor sent South for some medicine, which that day the stage brought to him in a small box.- The medicine did not quite fill the box, and some waste paper was put in to fill up the space. The Doctor took out the medicine, and examined the papers. As he stood read- ing a newspaper, Jane looked at him, and sail-   What can you ind there, Doctor, to inte- test you? Your countenance expresses emo- tion, but whether it be painful or pleasura- ble, I am not physiognomist enough to judge: let me see the paper, and judge.' The Doctor stepped to the stove, and put the paper into it, saying, 'The paper had a disagreeable smell.' 'Doctor,' said Jane, her eyes sparkling with rage, ' there was something in that pa- pernearly concerning me. What motive in- duced you to withhold it from me?' ' Oh, no, upon my honor, Jane, tha pa- per had been in contact with something very disagreeable, and might have been the means of injuring you in your present delicate state of health, and therefore I thought it unsafe for you to take it. Oh, Jane--I hope you do not think so bad of me as to think that I would deceive you in such a way.' The Doctor remained in his office during ' the evening. As soon as the Doctor was alone, he threw himself in a chair, and thus commu- ned- with- himself :- I This bird must not escape me now, when :she is almost in my net. Two months more, and she is mine, and a cool hundred thou- sand with her. The old fellow finally owned the whole, when he found that he had got to swing for it. Curse on that paper-it has raised foul suspicions in her mind ; but I must satisfy her. It will not do to keep her here-thiss is too public a place-she will be writing to some of her old firiends, and that will completely upset my plans. I must in- vent means to secure her.  She shall be mine!' The Doctor appeared quite thoughtful the next morning, and after remarking that he had some patients to attend to that day, thus addressed Jane:- (Jane, you must fish alone until my pa- tients get better, and then I shall find more pleasure in going with you. I shall be home by two or three o'clock, and if you are then fishing, I will join you.' In a few minutes his horse was mounted, and he left. In order to carry on our story connected- ly, it will now be necessary to describe ano- ther scene farther down the river. At the time of our tale, there was, in the north-western part of the State of New York, a fine little Indian village, consisting of thir-   ty or forty huts, scattered at random, as the fancy of the builder might dictate. The land, which was common stock, was unfenced, and there was no obstruction to a free passage in. any direction. The village stood on the banks of a little river, from which the inhabitants obtained their subsistence mostly. A small rudely-constructed dam had been thrown a- cross the stream below the village, which caused the river to expand so as to assume the appearance of a miniature lake, on the smooth surface of which might at all timed be seen the light' canoe gliding swiftly 'up and down. Some contained men with their guns for hunting-others with women and their fishing tackle-others with boys and girls and their bows and arrows. All coun- tenances beamed with joy and gladness and merriment. A  stranger would judge that they never knew pain or want. A trail which served for a bridle path, led through the deep recesses of the thick forest to the public road, about three miles distant. On a fine, pleasant day, a stranger enter- ed the villade by this path, on horseback.- It was evident he was acquainted in the vil- lage by the frequent greetings he received from the Indians, as he passed along on his way. He rode directly to a hut in the cen- tre of: the village, at the entrance of which he stopped, and inquired of a boy if Oneida was at home.  The Indian came out of the hut immedi- ately, and said, in very good English- ' How do you do, Doctor?' ' Well, quite well, Oneida,-come with me to the bushes-I have business-with you there.' The two were soon hid within the thicket, where they held a long conference in a low and cautious tone. At length they parted- the Indian to his hut, and the horseman to the public road: the last words of the'latter were- ' Don't forget, Oneida, to-morrow after- noon.' The Indian nodded his head, and passed on. About three o'clock that afternoon, Jthe Doctor joined Jane at the fishing rock. He appeared more lively than usual. After he, had talked a few minutes with Jane, he wal- ked away down the river, and was soon seen on a point which projected into the river, and A,   hid its farther course from view. He there stripped a piece of bark from a tree, and re- turned -to the rock. He said that as it was getting late, they had better return to the house, and they accordingly returned. The next morning the Doctor told Jane he had found a new fishing ground, and that if she would be at the biold rock about two or three o'clock, he would show her a beautiful little arbor- he had discovered the previous 4 day. Jane recollected his walk the day be- fore, and promised to meet him there at that time. The old lady and Jane took their dinner about one o'clock, and'soon after Jane was seen tripping across the meadow. She took her old stand, and soon became so absorbed in the sport, that her suspicious feelings to- wards the Doctor entirely left her. She was thus enjoying her sport, when, hearing a rus- tling in the leaves behind her, and supposing ,the Doctor had arrived, she turned with a merrylJaugh, and was about to speak, when she saw a tall Indian, with a tomahawk stuck in his belt' He sprang towards her. She uttered a shriek, and fell lifeless to the ground.  He raised her in his arms, o and sprang lighty-rough the bushes. He laid her inanimate foh in the bottom of his ca- noe, and springingto his paddle, swiftly gli- ded down the river When Jane returned to consciousness, she found herself lying on a rude couch in an In- dian lodge. A  swarthy old squaw was stan- ding by her, holding a- bottle in her hand, with some liquid in it, which she had been applying 'to Jane's face and temples, to re- store her. She raised her head, and in a be- wildered air exclaimed-. ' Woman! where am I?   Am I a captive here?'  -To these questions the woman only repli- ed by a  shrug of the shoulders, and' Me no e speak English.' She ran out and met near the entrance the same Indian who took her I from the rock. At the sight, Jane felt a 1 deathke faintness come over her, but sum- 1 moning all her fortitude, she said--  'Wretch, why have you brought me here? s Why am I   a captive in this place? Do you 1 not know you will be put to death by the white people if you detain me here? Carry me back y immediately, or all your people will be taken a and massacred.'   'Ha!' said'the Indian, 'white man no - come here. He not know you here. Ho 3 come in my town-he not see you. S'pose 3 you hallo, me stop your mouth--s'poso you run away, me catch you, put you in the  ground. You no tell nothing then. Indian b very cunning-he watch very close. S'pose you stay here two big moons-then me carry I you back to big rock, where you fish. You be good-no .run away-no make noise, me - be good'no hurt you-give you plenty for eat and drink. You notfbe good, Indian put you in the grQund-white man not know it.' Jane saw through the whole plot in a mo- ment. 'I He said, if I would stay two months peaceably, he then would carry me back.- Oh, that designing knave! does he think to force me to be his bride? I will show him I am not thus to be deceived. I am now con- vineed. that he saw- something in that paper that caused him to take this step. Bitterly shall he repent this treachery, if I ever get away. I must study some plan to escape, be- fore the time arrives that he is to take me back. I must be kind to all that I happen to fall in company with, and try to bribe some one to assist me to escape.' The hut that Jane was confined in, was a smaltone, without windows, but had several round holes in the upper part, that served to light it, and by the aid of a knife that she happened to have in her pocket, she succeed- ed in enlarging one of those holes, so that the whole village on that side could be seen. She lay on her bed, and saw all that was going on. When any one entered, she concealed the hole with the clothes, and it was never discovered.  She. had been in her prison about a week when her door one day was opened, and a ' tall, slim young Indian entered, and commen- cediconversation with her in tolerable English. As he appeared quite friendly, Jane asked him many questions, which he answered in a very kind and pleasant manner. She kept him as long as she could, and told him to re- ,turn the next day. She then began to invent some plan to bribe the young Indian to assist her to escape. The next day, according to agreement, the young Indian made his appearance. As soon as he entered the hut, Jane went and sat   down by his side-taking his band, and pres- Bing it to her lips. ' Oh, my dear good friend, can't you help me to go to my friends? If you will, I will give you as much money as you wish, or any' thing else that you may ask.' Ho!' said he, ' s'pose me help you go, Oneida kill me,-Oneida get much money for keep you. He let you go soon. He be good to you--be no dare hurt you, He kill me, s'pose me let you go.' As the Indian was'speaking,he was close- ly examining a very coatly bracelet that Jane wore on her wrist. It was one that her step- father had bought her on tier sixteenth birth- dly. It was very beautiful-the gold glitter- ing of the beautiful jewels was richly carved. Jane unfastened it from her wrist, and gave it to him. ' There,' said she, ' that is yours. Now help me to escape.' I Don't speak,' said he, returning the brace- let, ' I come to-morrow.' So saying, he went out. Jane returned to her look-out aperture, and was viewing the children as they played about in the dirt. She almost wished herself one of them, they seemed so perfectly happy. Her attention- was soon diverted by another object-a man approaching on horseback.-- As he neared the house, she was astonished to behold the form and features of her former friend, Doctor Cole. He came within a few rods of her, and was met by{Oneida. They conversed a few min- utes, ana then the-Doctor took from his pock- et a book, which he gave to the Indian, and also some money.. Having done this, he tur ned and rode off. Jane was almost on the point of crying to him for assistance; but, on mature consideration, she decided to be qui- et, and trust to the exertions of the young Indian. Oneida soon entered with a book in his hand, and gave it to Jane, who asked him where he procured it. His reply was-- ' Me s'pose you read--me buy you book.' ' What did you pay for this book?' said Jane. 'Oh, me pay one two dollar--he very good book,' said he, leaving the room. Jane, if shedfhad previously had any doubts, was now satisfied as to the cause and object of her confinement. She had, until now, some   doubts as to the Doctor's being the cause; but this served to convince her. The next day the young Indian came in and sat down by Jane, and looked her full in the face, and said-- ' You do this,' and scratched on the floor in imitation of a person writing. ' Oh yes,' was her reply. 'Me run very fast-me go to any place,' said be. Jane in a moment caught at his meaning, and said- ' Did you ever go to Lake Champlain?' ' The big waters towards the sunrise?' said he, 'me go there much-see big fire canoe there, once.' .  ' Will you carry a letter there for me " said she, her eyes sparkling in anticipation of her hoped-for deliverance. ' S'pose you no speak Oneida,' said the Indian, ' me go quick.' ' Can you get me some paper and ink?' said Jane. ' Ho!-' -said he, Indian no have paper.' Jane recollected that when the Doctor gave her the little straw hat, it was too large for her, and she took a sheet of paper, folded it up, and put it under the lining. She caught up her hat, and found the paper still there, clean and white. When the Indian saw the paper, he started, and said- ' I come again to-morrow,' and left her. The next day he returned, and gave her a -cup of some black dye, and a wild goose-quill. Jane prepared, and soon wrote the following letter:-        .  "To the sympathy of the publie I appeal. Gentlemen, I am an orphan, by name Jane Arlington, of Shell Harbor, in this State- am a captive to the Indians on the Shawshoe river. I suffer more than words can tell, and pray you to devise means to release me. For the sake of humanity I entreat you to rescue me from a prison more loathesome than death itself." She folded the letter, which she gave to the Indian, saying- ' Carry this to the Lake, and wait until the fire canoe, as you call it, comes along-then step on board, aid give this to the best-look- ing man you see, and tell him to read it, and give to the passengers on board. Stay, and   answer all the questions put to you. ' So say- ing, she gave him the-dollar she had receiv- ed a short time before her captivity for her fish. Then giving him the bracelet, she said, ' show that, and say I gave it to you for your Atrouble. Now be careful that Oneida don't mistrust and stop you.' A Ho!' said the Indian, ' Oneida very cun- ning. He no so cunning as Shawshane.- Shawshane run great deal for Oneida--Onei- da no give anything. White girl give Shaw- shane great deal. Shawshane love white girl, he run quick to big waters.' Thus saying, the young Indian concealed the letter in his moccasin, and started. Here, for the present, we will leave our heroine, and return to Mr. Sinclair and his son, whom we left in the city of New York. CIIAPTER XII. After the conviction of Merton, and George Sinclair, (aslie shall in future call Barton,) had obtaine'ffull account of all the property and money that would now fall to Jane Ar- lington, the father and son left New York, and took ther way to the north. They arri-  Ved at Shell Harbor the next day, where ttey spent two days in arranging the busi- nes there so that Jane would have no diffi- culty in obtaining her rights when she came t to tlaim them--having finished which, they t agan s4arted up the river. ' bw, my son,' said Mr. Sinclair, ' ou have f along time been a rambler without a ao   e, and I have been in pursuit of you, o wfse off than you, for you were blessed with ( a clear conscience, and I have been torment- t- ed with the sting of guilt constantly in my a breast, night and day without cessation, ever n since I was convinced of your innocence.- h Now,   George, let us return to that home al which has for so long a time been'ldeserted re by its rightful owners, and then let me re- deem my character, and clear my conscience, se by making you thebwner of all the vast es- ui estate I  now possess. I hope, that this act y will atone for my brutal and unfatherly con- be duct towards you,'           W '  Dear father,' said George,  , you wrong wl yourself by making such. statements. As for myself, I  never for a moment, even in my le( most destitute and tryin g times, accused you it of anything wrong; but on the contrary, al- th z         Y- ways said that you acted the part of an honor. v- able man. Had I been the villain you had or the best reasons in the world to think me- I, had I been guilty of those crimes which were r substantially proved against me, my punish- ft ment could not have been too severe. My business, however, is not yet accomplished. a- I have another act to perform before I can - sit down quietly for a single moment, and be i- at rest, It is, my dear father, to find that r- wronged and persecuted girl, and see her in 1, peaceable possession of her just rights. When that is accomplished, I will return to you, d and I hope enjoy the blessings of a father's love and confidence for many years to come.' r  ' Now, father, do you return to your home, s and enjoy that rest and quietness which you have for so long a time been deprived of, and which you-so much need. I will soon join you, if I am successful,' ' No, my  son, I said when I left that home, I would never return to it, unless you accompanied me.   I took an oath to spend the remainder of my life a solitary wanderer, unless I found you to enjoy the blessings of a home with me. I will accompany you un- til your designs lare accomplished-then we will again retu'n to that deserted home.' This being decided upon, the father and son embarked on board the first steamer for the village of O  . George and his fa- ther-embarked on board the same steamer, still commanded by the same captain to whom George had offered himself two years before a's a lertk, and not being able to recollect his own  name, was rejected with derision.- George had never related this circumstance to his father. After the boat was under way, George told the captain he had some busi- ness to transact with him, and wished to see him in his private state-room, whither George and his father and the captain immediately repaired. ' Captain',' said George, after they were seated,  ' have you any recollections of an unsophisticated country youth coming aboard your boat about two years ago, who was a- bout to engage himself as a clerk on board, when unfortunately he bad forgotten his name, which debarred him of the situation?' 'I do,' replied the captain, 'well recol- lect that circumstance, and have often told it; but never could imagine what could be the trouble with the young man. He appear-   e. very much embarrassed and confused.- Do you know anything of him?' ( I do,' said George, ' I was that green boy, and will tell you the cause, as I have now present good testimony to substantiate my statements.' EIe then related the whole transaction pre- vious, and the embarrassed situation in which bhe left home. lWhln he had concludecdr la- ting his adventures, the cheeks of both were wet with the warm tears of sympathy. On arriving at the village of C--, Geor- ge's first object was to seek Catherine Law- rence, whom he found in her room, where the reader saw her and our Iheroine at a for- mer time. After passing the usual compli- ments, George carelessly inquired for Miss Arlington. Catherine related to him all that had happened to her after he had left, up to the tilme when she was taken sick, of which the reader is already acquainted. Farther thian that, she had never been able to learn anything concerning her. She had often in- quired what had become of her, of people she thought would know; but instead of receiv- ing any information, was obliged to lis- ten to many slanderous reports which had their origin with Mrs. Prim, of some unheard- of crime or impudence she had been guilty of at the time she resided with that pattern of piety and morality, which, said Catherine, so disgusted me with the base deception of that woman, that I determined not to ask any more for her until I could find some one who knew something of the character of that love- ly girl.' ' Oh! the accursed deception and treache- ery that is cloaked under the false garb of pi- ety and morality, by that vile woman!' said George, as he turned to leave the apartment, saying, however, to Catherine, before he left, ' I will find that girl before I stop, if she is living ; and when I do find her, that foul slanderer shall ask her forgiveness, or- dearly pay for her impudent statements.' George went directly to his father, and re- lated to him the facts as far as he had been able to ascertain. Having done which, he sald- 'Father, I have taken an oath never to settle down quietly until I find that girl whom they have so well succeeded in making mise- rable, and she obtains redress fromher infa- mous enemies. I must leave here immedi. F     i   - ately, and travel until I sueedt. You can return home with the assurance that as soon i as my present designs, are accomplished, I i will join you. Ask me not to do so before.' 3 -  No, imy son,' said his father, ' I shall not return alone, but will remain herdeuntil you - are willing to accompany nme. I already feel as much interest in the young lady as you do - yourself, and will not return until we succeed i in ascertaining her fate.' George set out immediately for the house, where June had been sick. He was there in- formnned where she went upon leaving that place.  He followed on to Doctor, Cole's * house, where lie arrived early in the morning. - As he stopped before the house, a man apd peared at the door, of whom he inquired-- ' Can you tell me, sir, if a gentleman by the name of Doctor Cole-resides here?' I He does, sir,' replied the person addres- sed, ' I am the person you inquire for.' ' ' I wish to inquire for another person, Doc- tor,' said George, 'and I hope you will be able to give me the information I seek. Can y ou inform me where a young lady by the name of Jane Arlington is to be found." ' I am extremelysdlrry, sir,' answered the Doctor, ' to be obliged to answer the ques- tion in the negative. I have."not slept a night for the last weekl; but I have spent night and d(iy i a fruitless search through tile woo-ls, and in the river for her. She dis- appeared' a week ago to-day, and we have searched -the wilderness, and dragged the riv. er for her body, but without success,-not the least trace of her can be found.' ' iMy God!' cried George, in agony ' You don't mean to say that she is lost'. ' I wish,' replied the Doctor, 'that I could say something else ; but it is too true. She was in the habit of goingl to the liver ly, and spending two or thlree hours in the plea. sant recreation of angling. A week ago to. day, I returned from visiting my patients, and to my surprise, found that she had nob returned. I immediately repaired to the place - where she always went to fish, and there found all of her fishing tackle, and several fine large fish lying upon the ground, but she was nowhere to bLe seen. I called upon her name, and ran up and down the bank of the river, until my cries aroused the neighbors. We then went into a thorough search, and bare but just given it up this morning.'   ' Oh! my God! my God!' cried George, the tears coursing down his manly cheeks, 'can it be that she is lost-irretrievably lost, just at the dawning of her prosperity?' ' I think,' said the Doctor, ' this must be 'Mr. Barton, of whom I have heard her speak in very high and affectionate terms.' 'I lmust be the person, if you have heard her speak of any one by that name;' 'She is an amiable young lady,' said the worthy son of jEseulapius, ' she has gained the good will of all the inhabitants since she has been with us.  They were all in love with her, and there has been a universal mourning throughout the town for the past week.' * Will you show me the place that you speak of as her fishing resort?' inquired George. The Doctor led the way, and they repair- ed to the fishing rock. ' There,' said the Doctor, ' are her fishing tackle, as she left them; and there are also the fih that she had cought, decaying upon the glound where She left the'm.' George took up the fishing tackle, and ex- amined them closely. He then looked at the putrifying fih that lay before himn on the rock. At length, turning to the Doctor, he said- ' What town or village does this river pass through below here?' ' It passesathrough-an Indian village, about six miles below here.' * Is the river navigable for canoes between the two places?' ' I think canoes can come here,' was the reply, 'I ut,' continued he,' I have never seen them as far up as this. I have some suspicions of the Indians, but their chief tells me that she has not been bro't to their village. If any of the tribe know anything concerning her mysterious disappearance, he will be sure to find it out, if there is nothing said that will lead them to think they are suspected; and he will inform me if he obtains any know- ledge as to where she is. She may be in their possesion, and the hopes of obtaining a ransom may possibly induce them to keep her for a time; -but should we demand the privi- lege of searching their village, she wil in all- probability, be murdered; so I thinlwo'd not be safe to make any attempt at prsent te aroh their village. You had tetter re To   turn home as soon as anything can be ascee* , tained respecting her, I will immediately in- form you. I will bribe some that I am ac- quainted with to inform me if she is at their village, or if any of the tribe are implicated in her mysterous abduction ; for I cannot but think that she has been abducted,--she may possibly, however, have fallen, or have been thrown into the river.' (Your plan looks plausible, and may pos- sibly be the best one to follow. I will leave- and let no one know that I have been hero in search of her, and if possible, let all the circumstances be forgotten as soon as possi- ble. You will be sure to do all that liesa within your power to do; and whether you succeed or not, you shall receive a handsome remuneration for your trouble. Spare -neither exertions nor expense, and don't fail to writo to me upon the first indications of your hav- ing found any traces of her." Saying which, he bade the Doctor ' goo4 day,' and rapidly rot away from the vil- lage. George returned to, his father a poor, dis- appointed, and nearly heart-broken young man. He informed him of his failure, and' that the young lady was either dead, or had perhaps meat a fate worse than death, that of being captive to, and in the power of a mer- ciless band of savages. His grief was so ex- cessive, that it came near producing insanity in the young lover. He and his father deci- ded to return home, and then concoct some plan for their future operation; and,if neces-, sary, to penetrate into the labyrinths of the vast wilderness that lay extended upon all sides of them, and visit the innumerable tribes that inhabit it for the purpose of receiving some tidings of the lost one. CHAPTER XIII Accordingly, when the steamer arrived, George and his father took passage for the south. George tried to forget his trouble, and occupy his mind in viewing the splendid scenery that presented itself on either side of the. Lake. He remained on deck until they arrived at the next place where the boat was to stop. As the boat neared the wharf, George stood viewing the dense mass of peo- ple who crowded on the dock. He noticed a person standing a little aside from the crowd )   who appeared to be watching the movements d of those on board with a strange, but guard- a t ;ed cariosity. Upon a closer examination, George discovered that the solitary person cc was a native of the wilderness. He was very y slim, but tall and well-made. A thought en- a t  rcd George's mind in a minute that the In- tl dian might be one of the tribe that the Doc- ti tor toldl him lived about six miles down the u river from his residence : and as he might y possibly know something of the lost maiden, e dceterninced to spend all the time that the v boat should lie at the dock in conversation u with the Indian, and he stepped forward to G the gangway in order to be nearenough when d the boat touched, to jump ashore. He noti- n cerd thlt the Indican held a letter in his hand, and so great was his inmpatience that he was c about to leap ashore while the boat was yet e at sorne distance therefrom, when he was an- y ticipated in his purpose by the indisn, who f bounded like a pantler on the vessel's deck. c George in a moment. stood before the Iudian, 1 and impulsively reached out his hand to take f the letter. The Indian hesitated for a mo- t ment, but after keenly surveying the passen- I gers, he handed the leteer to George, say- 4 Yes, you good-looking man.' George eagerly opened the letter, and, to bis joy, found that it was truly as he had sur- nisecld. He was so excited on reading the let  ter, which the reader has already seen, that lie uttered a loud exclamation of joy, and threw his arms around the young Indian,em-. braced him as if he had been his brother.- The Indian shrunk back as George threw his arms around him, but directly saw that joy and not anger, prompted the act. George then related to the passengers, in a loud and clear voice, the mibfortunes that had befallen the youg lady, and he then read the letter that he had in his hands, and said- ' Gentlemen, what must be done?-the young lady must not be left there to suffer another day.' ' She mst be immediately liberated,' was the unanimous response of all on board. The captain proposed that, with the Indian for their guide, they should proceed in a mass to the Indian village, and rescue the maiden at all events. This was agreed to. At this stage of the prodeedings, a gentleman on the   dock called the attention of the p eople, and addressed them thus:- Gentlemen, I would propose a different course to be pursued for the liberation of the young lady. There is in the garrison here, a force of two hundred soldiers. I command the post,-the  Pease shall be stated to the troops, and I will detach as many as will vol- unteer for the service, to be placed under this young man's command.' All agreed that this was much the best way, and the boat soon left to pursue her reg- ular trip, with all tie passengers except George and his father, who remained in or- der to effect Jane's release from confine- ment. George then accompanied the commanding officer to the barracks. The troops were call- ed out-the case was stated, and volunteers were called for. About one hundred stepped forth, and offered their services. The officers consulted with the young Indian, mad'came to the conclusion that fifty Inen would be a force sufficient to perform the allotted under-  aking.  Accordingly, fifty men were se.  lected from the volunteers, and ordered to be ready to start on the following morning by day-break, provided with a plenty of am- munition, and a week's provisions. ) The nest morning the whole detachment  with George Sinclair and Shawshane at their head, left the village. The second day after t Shawshane lefth-e6'Indian village, Oneida 1 wished to send some dispatch, and called at v the hut of Shawshane, who was runner of the - tribe, but was told that he had been absent s two days. From the fact that Shawshane had y been frequently in the apartment of the pris- e oner, Oneida was led to mistrust that he haa d gone to the white settlement, to give notice n of her confinement. He therefore ordered a )r scout to be sent out in the direction it was supposed he had taken, to reconnoitre, and e when he discovered any inimical moverpents, 6r to proceed to Oneida's village, and gire the alarm. fs  At night, on the second day after George and his party left the barracks, they bad ar- in rived, as their guide informed them, within Bs three leagues of the Indian village,and George en with a party of' six soldiers and Shawshane, ,is had got some distance in advance of the maia he body of the troops. They thought beet to   trepare to eneamp for the night, as it would be late before they could reach the Indian village, and be joined by the body of troops. 'The party of eight that were in advance, went on about their preparations for a bivou- nac, when the'attention of the Indian scout, who had stationed himself on the mountain, was:drawn to the smoke of the party's fire. He crept up until, as he supposed, he could plainly see all the detachlment. Then with with with the swiftness of a greyhound lie ran to the village, and reported to Oneida what he had discovered. He told him that the strength of the advancing party consisted of an office, six soldiers, and Shawshane.- Oneida laughed at this information, but he immediately dispatched an express to Doctor Cole, requesting him to repair immediately to his village to hold a council with him ais to the course and measures it was best to adopt. When the Doctor arrived, hel scouted the idea of danger, but advised Jane's removal to tome other place for security. ' Don't be frightened,' said Oneida, 'we can muster fifteen well-armed warriors, and you Doctor, and myself, make seventeen.- If they comehbere, we will receive them as becomes our brave nation. Arm yourself, assume command of half the men, with whhich you can remain in-the village, while I, with the other half, will advance and engage them./: ' Are you sure,' said the Doctor, ' that there are but eight of them?' Our scout has seen them,' said Oneida, ' and is,sure of their number.' The men were accordingly called out, and well armed. - Half of them were then placed under Doctor Cole's command, while Oneida with the remainder .entered the forest and commenced his march. In a comparatively short space of time, they reached a favorable spot for an ambuscade, aud concealed them- . selves under the shelter of a hill, with orders - to rise and fire, when the advancing hostile party should reach a certain point. Oneida and his men had not long remained in am- bush, when Oneida gave a sign to listen, and at the same time he placed his ear to the ground; After listening a few moments, he said-- ' I am not mistaken-I hear the tread of, more than eight men on the other side of the hill.   Their anxiety was aoon'relievedl by the ap. pearance above the hill, of ftle party under George. The Indians kept their position un- , til the whole party came in view, when Onei- da gave the order to retreat to the village.-- , He saw that they were too strongeto contend , against, and he hoped to get in the village, and dispose of his prisoner, ere they could l approach, and then to offer no'resistance or I opposition. The Indians took to flight, but'George'di. L vining Oneida's object, commanded them to stop, at the same time ordering lis men to advance with p11 speed. Seeing that the In- dians were gaining ground, George ordered his men to fire on them as they were upon the run. A volley of muskets were filred, and three Indians fell. The remainder were out of sight before a second shot could be made., The Indians retreated until they came to the place where Doctor' Cole and his party were stationed. 'The Doctor ordered themn to stand their grround, and to face the enemly like men. They declared to hm in the In- dian langflago, (none being able to speal English,) thllt resistance was useless, as Oneci- da was killed, and the enemy an lhunlred strong. ,To all this the Doctor, who-(di not understand a word they said, with a Ijistol i; eali hanld, said he would shoot any who tri- ed to escape. By the time the Doctor had. rallied the Indians, George and hism till  arri- ved, and bursting through the bushes, sur- rounded. them ere they bad- time to raise a hand in resistance. The Indians were sectU- red and bound, and'elose beside them I .stood Doctor Cole, sullen as a caged tiger. CHAPTER Xiy. Ilaving secured the prisoners, and being in undisturbed possession of the' village, 'v George, ever occupied with the subject near- est his heart, desired Shawshane, who was always at" his side, to conduct hln to the pre- sence of her he so dearly loved, and a love he had so nobly proven. The Indian led George to the house in the central part of the village, and then said- ' White girl here when me leave.' George waited for no ceremony, but appli- ed his. foot to the door with such force that it yielded, and in another moment Jane 'was y   clasped to his heart. She would have fallen to the floor on seeing him, had he not caught her in his arms. He stepped out into the air with his lovely burthen in his arims. The firesh air soon restored her, and seeing Shawshane standing near, she sprang to li,),' embraced him, and loaded him with thanks and expres- sions'of heartfelt gratitude. Sllhe then turned to George, in whose lheart there was Ibegin- ning to rise the tleelds of jealousy, and said--- ' Oh, George! to this good and faithful friend, do we owe all.--myt life, my liberty, and the happiness wlhich I now enjoy.' She then took the hand of each, and all three fell nupon their kn!ee, and thanked God for their preslent lalppiness. Then rislng to their feet, she jo,ined the hands of the two youn rlnon, and said- ' You two are the onlyv friendls I have in the world. Swear to be friends and brothers throughl litfe. I love you Iotlh more than a- ny otlher beings in the worldl.' George then addressing Jane, said- ' You had better retuin into the liouse un- til we dis pose of oalr prisoners, and make the necessary ipreparations to return.' ' No, George,' was her reply, ' I will nev er agailn suffer you to leave me, nntil I am safe out of the reactel of these treacienrous peo- ple. I will go with you--the pure fi'esh air will have ,an invigolating eftect on my still feeble framne.' Thlley then turned to the late scene of ac- tion, whlere qte remainder of the party still When they approached the scene of con- flict, thley behclld the Indians bound, and the Doctor a ncr the r them.'  H lIave you the comlinand of this party?' said the Doctor, addressing our hero. 'At present 1 have,' was George's reply. 'Then sir,' said the Doctor: * I wish to know hy what authority you detain mne hero as a prisoner. I am a physiciuan, in the prac- tice of my profession, and I comlmand you to release ne immediately, qr keep me under the penalty of being prosecuted for falso im- prisonment.' ' Doctor,' said George, ' I have had the honor of your acquaintance before, and well do I remembler the falsehoods you then tola me ; and nbw sir, you shall suffer for your black and treacherous orimes. You ask why   you are deta ind; a-a prisoner. Why should not you, an American citizen, taken in arms, fighting against your country's troops and fllag, with a band of savages, meet with instant death  You riuhly deserve it. These poor, ignorant deluded savages are blameless--' they did but what you, their commander, bade theim, since in ease of disobedience they knew that death or torture awaited them. But you, sir, a man of education, standing high in com- munity, volunteer your services to fight your own countrymen! What excuse can you of- fer for thus degrading yourself-for commitl ting crimes of so black a dye? You are silent. I, however, will answer. You did this to pre- vent the discovery of your crimes-of your having had this noble lady borne away from the-haunts of civilization by that chief, the vile instrument of your crimes, who has now gone to account to God for his crimes, and confined heA or'what purpose, you yourself bast know.  dw,: sir,t you must make up your mind to suffer the most rigorous penal- ties of the law.' Tlhe Doctor saw that-his schemes were de- tected, and he felt the full weight of his des- perate situation. Raising his eyes to the face of liis capiurer, in an imploring voice, while tlhe tears gashed friom his eyes, and trickled down his face, thus did he address our hero . 'Oh, for the love of God! Captain, take pit y on my .itnation, or I shall be ruined for, ever'!-not from any base motive, but for love-pure,. unalloyed love for thaterngelio being,' did f all these things. I bribed the Indian to take and detain her for a time, in order that you might' not meet. She promis- ed me that she would marry me at the end of three months, provihed she heard nothing from you. Oh for the sake of my poor wid, owed mother, who is wholly dependent on me for her support, spare me! I am her only child. Pardon me this time, and restore me to an affectionate mother, whom your decis. ion will render happy or miserable for life.' Jane, who had listened to thiscappeal, while the large tears chased each other down h3 er pale cheeks in quick succession,a addre- sed G eorge ataits'conclusion, thus ; l  'George, there is one favor I must ask of r you, and on your answer will depad my ba- r camingo'our wife, That favor grauted, and   I am yours forever, wherever you desire me ear Jane; that I may bind you by your word,' said he. ' George,' said she, ' when I was deserted by all humnan beings, and left to die for want of medical aid, this man took pity on me, and saved my life. He took me to his house, where he and his excellent mother attended to me night and day: they did everything,to console and comfort me. Now George, the fa- vor thaW I Ok is, that with these hands you will allow his cords to be cut-that you will give me the happiness to say to him-you are free-go to your mother, and tell her that Jane Arlington thus repays your kind- ness to lher. To you she rewards good for evil.' 'Dear Jane,' said he, 'your request is granted.'   - Jane stepped up to the Doctor, and tak- ing a knife from the ground, she cut the Fcords that bound him, saying  I GOo, and sin -no more!' .in the beautiful language of the Holy Writ. The Doctor ros6 to his feet-speechless with- gratitude ; he took her hand, and pressed it to his lips. Jane felt the warm tears fall up- on it. Neither were able to speak, for their hearts were full. Thus they parted-never again to meet in this,world of sorrow and troubje. After the Doctor' hd gone, George stood a moment, and looked at the poor Indians, Who had been forced to act as they had. He Was moved to pity those poor creatures-their wives and children standing crying around him. In a pleasant way, he spoke thus to Jane:-               ' ' My dear Jane, cannot you phad for those poor distressed creatures? Have you no pity for their wives and children, whom you see sorrowing ' ' Yes, George,' said she, ' but I dare ask no more4favors, I dare not overpower your  goodness.' ' Then,' msaid George, 'I will do as you would'wii'h.'-    Hee then freed them, and told them as 0O neida, the guilty one, had been slain, ho I deemed them blameless, and liberated them. They all fell on their knees, and put up a I fervent prayer for George, and the 'pale-face' t lady. t-  The soldiers then constructed a sort of ,couch, made of small poles, covered with [ skins taken fromin Oneida's lodge. Jane was placed on this, and she was carlried through * the woods by the soldiers. On the fifth day after the party left the garrison, they again arrived at it, safe and sound. George, with his father and Jane, accom- panied by Shawshane, left on the following , day, and we will vouch that a happier party. never embarked on board a steamer on Lake Champlain. They took their Way to Shell Harbor, where Jane was put in possession of her property, which amounted to about $100,000. Jane then said to Shawshane- 'I1 am now rich, my true friend, and if you can content yourself living here, :I will divide my property with you.' ' Indian like the woods-he no be happy with the pale-faces. He go in the woods, lie be happy. You. and pale-face chief be happy, Shawshane be happy. You no want Shaw. shane any more-Shawshane go to his people.' Shawshane was then loaded with costly presents, and departed, leaving our heroine in tears, for she was very much attached to the noble-hearted young Indian. Sbawshane, on his return to his native village, was elect- ed Chief in Oneida's place, on account of his great wealth and his influence with the white , people. A few days after the departure of Shawshano, the public papers announced the marriage of Mr. GIEO;IGE SINCLAIR to Miss JANE ARLTNG- TOon; and the latter days of this worthy cou- ple were as happy and unclouded, as their youth had been troublous and stormy. Thus, dear reader, you see that Virtue in due time  will meet with its just reward. '   Notice to the Traveling Public. A  .
