IN the days when Bihltuede was overseer in Gotham, and Slipridic was treasurer, and when they and Peter, surnamed Beezoueni, and Abraham,' whose surname was loaxumall, were chief men of Thur Ing, a new judgment hall was built in Gotham. 2. And the building thereof went on for many years, and treasures that could not be told, and that Slipridic, the treasurer, never did tell, were spent in the building, yet was it not finished. 3. For Bihltuede had pondered the matter, and saw that the new judgment hall was a Big Thing. 4. Now, in the tongue of the men of Gotham, a big thing was not called big because of its own bigness, but because of the bigness of other things that might be made out thereof. 5. For among the men of Gotham, and' chiefly among them of Thur Ing, there was a marvellous way of mfnking much out of little; and among all their makings there was never among them, nor among the men of any people or   48  ..    THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. nation, such a making of much out of little, as in the matter of the building of the new judgment hall. o. So Bihltuede told unto them of Thur Ing how big a thing the building of the new judgment hall was to be unto them, and that by- reason thereof, they and all their kinsfolk and acquaintance would win a blessing, even greater than that they had received aforetime, and wax richer and greater, and go on and prosper, even as io men had prospered since, the world began. 7. Then did Slipridic clap his hands, and he cried out, Yea, verily, I see the manner thereof,-and how it will be done: it is by the mystery of pursentojobbs. 8. But Bihltuede answered and said, No, my son, not by that mystery. Verily, the mystery of -pursentojobbs is a lovely mystery, and ought now and always to be spoken of with reverence; but it is not equal to the doing of this big thing. 9. Then Hoaxumall answered and said, Lo, it will be by some new mystery that my lord, the Boss, shall reveal unto US.    ; 10. But then did Bihltuede cast down his eyes, and look askance upon Hoaxumall, and smiled ,upon him, .as upon one that should be pitied and treated tenderly for his innocence -sake. And, he answered and said, No, my son, there shall be no new mystery revealed unto thee, but I will show unto thee and unto the rest of my disciples an old mystery, that ancient mystery and honorable, the mystery revealed unto Jemphrisc, and unto his master, Daniel, the Pharisee, by their familiar spirit, that goeth up and down in Ouahlstrete, the mystery that he began to practice at the beginning of the world, even the mystery of Tshee Tyng. ". Then all they of Thur Ing rejoiced, and their hearts were glad, and the countenances of them all were lifted up; for they knew the mystery of Tshee Tyng, and that it was ,B   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.      49 an ancient mystery, and one that had worked marvels and miracles; and they saw what was to be done for them by that mystery. 12. But Hoaxumall answered and said, Thy servant know- eth nothing of this matter. Pursentojobbs I understand; nor is the mystery of lobbeepheeze hidden from me; but of the mystery of Tshee Tyng I know nothing. Practice it, if ye will, among yourselves; but ask me not to be a sharer in your works. I wash my hands of this mystery. 13. And, like Pilate, Hoaxumall washed his hands of the matter; and the hearts of all that heard him were cast down. ". But Bihltuede opened his mouth and said, Let him wash: What is that to us? Pilate washed; but he signed the warrant; and was not that enough? Likewise it will be enough for us if Hoaxumall signs our warrants. Do we not keep him to write for us, and to speak for us? Far be it from us to trust him ever to think for us, or to act for us. 15. So it was concluded among them of Thur Ing that the new judgment hall should be built according to the mystery of Tshee Tyng. But, moreover, the mysteries of pursento- jobbs and of lobbeepheeze were not to be forgotten or set aside. 16. Then they sought out a chief builder, who should plan the judgment hall and oversee the building thereof, accord- ing to the great mystery. And they found one among their friends and acquaintance who was learned in that mystery. And, albeit, the law required that all builders should be asked to send in plans for the building to the overseers, cov- ered and sealed with a seal, so that the plan that seemed best in their eyes should be chosen, without knowing from what man it came ; yet was it found that the plan of that man was chosen. And this was done according to the mys- tery. , 17. And certain of the overseers bought a quarry, and   50      THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. then all the overseers bought of them the stone wherewithal to build the judgment hall at a great price; for, according to the great mystery, the overseer that bought the stone was not the same man as the overseer that sold the stone, and was in no wise answerable for his extortion. 18. Likewise they sought out chief workmen to do the work under the chief builder, and to furnish forth the judg- ment hall with carpets, and chairs, and all things that were needful. 19. And they found Ghar Phee, who was cunning to work in plaster, and Kih Zur, the worker in iron and metals, and who made pipes and hollow vessels, and Milah, the carpen- ter, and other men, whose names are of no account in these chronicles; but chiefly one Shamman, whose surname was Alias, and who was a cunning extortioner in all things, but chiefly in carpets. 20. But Bihltuede, seeing that these men would not suffice to make a big thing of the judgment hall, said, These be the the men that can be paid, according to the mystery, for things that are needful; but where be they that will furnish those things that are-not needful, and be paid therefor, and which verily, not being needful, ought not to be furnished? 21. And he sought such men and found them. But all this satisfied not the stomach of Bihltuede (for his stomach was boundless), and he sought out yet another man to receive money from  the Treasury, not only for the building of the judgment hall, but for all things needful, and, moreover, and chiefly, for all things not needful for the city. 22. (For Bihltuede said, Am I not sworn to oversee the payment of money for the city?." Verily I will oversee it.) 23. And he sought such a man, but found him not suffi- ciently after his own heart. For he sought one who would never be satisfied, and who could never be seen by other men.  -   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.      51 24. So he raised up for himself a familiar spirit; and the name of that spirit was Koh. And Koh received money for all things, but chiefly for those things that were not needful, and which, therefore, ought not to be furnished. And although Koh was always at the right hand of Bihltuede, no- man hath seen him unto this day. 25. And it came to pass, that when an artificer had done work upon the judgment hall, and had brought his bill there- for to the overseers, that they approved the same. Likewise also, did Hoaxumall, the governor of the city; and the arti- ficer took the bill to Slipridic, the treasurer, that he might receive the money therefor. 26. But Slipridic often paid him not, but said unto him, Be patient. I have not wherewithal to pay thee. This did he many times, until the man was weary-with asking. 27. Then did some one of the men of Thur Ing say unto him, I will buy thy bill of thee, and wait for payment. And the man sold his bill at usury; and if it were for one thou- sand pieces of silver, he received nine hundred. 28. And then did he who had bought the bill take it, and, like Phernandiwud, sit down quickly, and, instead of one thousand, he wrote ten thousand, and went with it to Slipridic. And Slipridic, who had not wherewithal to pay one thousand, had nevertheless wherewithal to pay ten thousand; and the nine thousand and one hundred were divided among Bihltuede and- Slipridic, and the other men of Thur Ing, except Peter Beezoueni, and Hoaxumall, the governor of the city, who, like Pilate, had washed his hands of this matter; and, verily, like Pilate, also, had signed the warrant. 29. (Nevertheless Peter Beezoueni and Hoaxumall found also their big things by being of Thur Ing; but they picked them up in another manner.) 30. And the plaster for which Ghar Phee received payment would have plastered the heavens above Gotham and the earth   52 -     THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. beneath; and the hollow vessels for which Kih Zur received payment, would have held the waters of the great river Hutzoon, and the pipes would'have carried:them off; and Slipridic paid Shamman for carpets that would have covered the streets of Gotham, and for chairs that would have' given seats to all the men thereof, and the women and the children, with two great ones, moreover, for Bihltuede and Jemphrisc to sit themselves abroad lupon. 31. Moreover, for the armories, and for decorations, and for iron chests, and for all other things that were needful for the city, and chiefly for those that were not needful, and which, therefore, ought not to be furnished, and were not furnished, like unto the sands of the sea for number, for all these things did Bihltuede's familiar spirit Koh receive payment, dividing the money among them of Thur Ing. - 32. Wherefore-the men of Thur Ing were blessed, even imore than they were aforetime, and they prospered exceed- ingly.   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.       53 CHAPTER II. 1. Jemphrisc and Staycool hunger for more. 2. And oould make akkawn- ah of gold. 5. Jemphrise seeth Ulyssses. 8. But Ulysses doth not se it. - 19. But JemphriseC and Staycool profit by the mystery. 1. Now Jemphrise and Staycool had riches in abundance;. but they were not content with the spoil of Cornelius, and of Daniel the Pharisee, and of the Query road; and having much they hungered yet for more. 2. And Staycool 'said unto Jemphrisc, Let us make akkawnah, we and our following, and get all the gold in Ouahlstrete. Then will the men. of Ouahlstrete have no gold wherewith to do their business of money-changing, and they must needs come to us to buy gold. 3. But. behold now, there is the gold in the treasury of Unculpsalm, that we cannot get; but let us see if we cannot devise some way so that it may not be sold in Ouahlstrete. Let us take counsel with Ulysses in this matter: peradven- ture he may be seen concerning it. 4. Now, in the tongue of Gotham, for a man to be seen concerning a matter meant that he should be shown that that matter would be to his advantage. 5. Wherefore, Jemphrisc went to Ulysses and said unto him, Tell thy servant in secret what will be done with the gold that is- in the treasury of Unculpsalm. This he did, knowing that Ulysses would divine that his answer might profit him greatly,- and that he might share the gains of Jemphrisc and Staycool. 6. Now, Ulysses was not skilled in statecraft, although he was cunning to fight, and in all that pertained to war and to the business of a great captain. But two things he knew    54.      THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.  well: yea, three were the constant thought of his soul: to do right, to be obstinate, and to keep his own counsel. 7. Wherefore, he looked into the face of Jemphrisc, and answered him, saying: Is it right for the chief ruler of the land to tell one man in secret what will be done with the gold in the Treasury which cometh from all the people of the land? 8. And when Jemphrisc heard these words" and felt the eyes of Ulysses upon his eyes, he was silent; and he turned away firom the face of Ulysses, and went and hid himself. For he saw that Ulysses had read his soul and would reveal nothing. 9. Nevertheless, he went on with Staycool to make akkawnah, and to get all the gold in Ouahlstrete. Moreover, they hoped that they should discover the counsel of Ulysses through his kinsfolk and his friends, by seeing them. 10. And when they had gotten much of the gold into their hands, and into the hands of their following, Jemphrisc went into Ouahlstrete, and cried out, Behold, we have all the gold in Gotham! -Buy of us, at our own price, or ye shall have none wherewith to do your business of money-changing. ". Then were the men of Ouahlstrete sore dismayed, and they began to buy gold of Jemphrisc and of Staycool and their following; and for two days they bought, and the more they bought the more they seemed to need, and each hour Jemphrisc and Staycool asked more of them, until it came to pass that there was woe in Ouahlstrete and great wailing; for men knew not at one hour what they would pos- 'sess of this world's goods the next. 12. And it came to pass on the third day that all Ouahl- strete was in an uproar, and was filled with men that had ' bought gold, to their own destruction; and it seemed as if. that place was the dwelling-place of demons. 13. But still they bought, going into the snare that Jem- i ,                   .     .   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. -     55 phrisc had spread for them, and flinging themselves into the pit that Staycool had digged for them;- and it seemed that before the going down of the sun Jemphrisc and Staycool would indeed be masters of all the gold in Ouahlstrete. And he who is master of all the gold there is master of all the men therein, and of many elsewhere. ". Then did Jemphrisc triumph openly, and went -about boasting and saying unto the men of Ouahlstrete that he was their master. And there was a great tumult; and a cry went up that they should take Je-mphrisc and Staycool and the chief of their following and slay them. 15. But, now in the midst of the uproar there came one saying, Why are ye thus troubled to buy gold? Behold, Ulysses hath commanded his chief treasurer to offer the gold of the treasury of Unculpsalm in Ouahlstrete, that all men may buy it at the worth thereof. 16. Then the tumult subsided, and Jemphrisc shut up his mouth and fled. 17. And Ouahlstrete was filled with men that had lost all by reason of Jemphrisc and Staycool; and many women and  children came to want by reason of them; and for many days the business of the merchants and money changers in Ouahlstrete, and in all the land of Unculpsalm was in con- fusion because of them. 18. Yet did Jemphrise -and Staycool get great gain, although they made not akkawnah. And the gain that they got was gotten by the great mystery used by BihItuede and the men of Thur Ing, even the ancient and venerable mystery of Tshee Tyng. 19. For they said to the -men to whom they had given promises by the mouths of their messengers and their repre- sentatives: These awre not our promises, neither will we fulfil them; but the promises of other men made to them, they required of them and received. Thus did the great   56      THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAMX. mystery of Tshee Tyng bring riches and prosperity to Jem- phrisc and to Staycool, even as to Bihltuede and Slipridic and all them of Thur Ing. 20. And out of this matter there came honor only to one man, even to Ulysses, the chief ruler; and the people remembered how he had rebuked and put down Jemphrisc at first, even more than how he had confounded his devices in the end. And thereafter they put their trust in Ulysses even more -than they had done before. i.  , ' .   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.       5 F T * CHAPTER III. 1. Jemphrisc becometh a soldier. 4. And buyeth a regiment. 7. He deviseth glorious apparel. 9. And getteth himself a war-horse. ". Goeth with his soldiers to Thub Ranch. 13. Of the manner of purification at Thub Ranch. 18. Jemphrisc maketh a camp there. 27. Goeth to Bosstown. 84. And prayeth there. 1. AND after these things Jemphrisc pondered in his mind 'what he should do next, and he bethought him that he would be a soldier. 2. And- this was after the fashion of the men of Gotham. For he said within himself, I know nothing of arms, neither of marching nor of setting in battle array; I cannot tell the hilt of a sword from the blade thereof, neither do I know my right foot from my left; therefore it behoveth me that I shall be a soldier; yea, verily, and not a soldier to be com- manded and to learn war, but a captain, a centurion, to com- mand a battalion. For is it not according to the use of Gotham to set men up as rulers who know neither how to command nor how to obey? 3. Therefore will I take the money that I have gotten by this mystery of Tshee Tyng and with it I will buy some sol- diers; even as Staycool, and Cornelius, and Daniel the Pharisee, have bought lawyers, and judges, and lawgivers (for cannot anything be bought in Gotham?) and the soldiers shall make me captain of their band. 4. Then did Jemphrisc buy some- soldiers; and 'when the time came that they should choose their chief officer he gave gifts unto them and made them promises. 5., For he said, Is it not written that ye shall use all dili. gence to make your calling and election sure?  Wherefore I   58   ;   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. will be diligent to make sure my calling as a soldier and my election as chief officer. 6. And when rthe election was made, behold, Jemphrisc was chosen chief officer:: whereupon he made an olation to the soldiers and thanked them that they had put their trust in him and had done him honor in preferring him to be their chief officer: even as Cornelius had made an oration to the people and had thanked them for the statue'that he had paid for. For such is the manner of the men of Gotham. 7. Now when Jemphrisc was' elected chief officer, he began immediately to devise glorious apparel in which to array himself when he marched before his soldiers in the eyes of the men and moreover of the Iwomen of Gotham. For to the soul of Jemphrisc this was the chief end of being a sol- dier and an officer. 8. Wherefore. he got for himself wonderful garments, such as had never before been seen on any officer in Gotham, nay, in the land of Unculpsalm; and he covered them with the gold that he had won in ,Ouahlstrete; and when he wore them, all eyes were turned upon him, for he was marvellous to behold. 9. Likewise he got himself a war-horse, even one that smelled the battle afar off. For he said, When I am upon him it is better that he should smell the battle afar off than I very near; for where is the advantage of such close smell- ing? 10. Moreover, he thought within himself, if I, not knowing the words of command and the manner of setting men in battle array, should not be able to stay my soldiers after I have put them in motion, when I am at their head, a war-horse will make, me secure, that they march not over me. ,11. And when the summer was come, Jemphrisc took his journey to a place by the sea-side called Thub Ranch; and he took his soldiers with him, that he might exercise them in ', ' *  '  '  ' ts!   THE CHRONICLES OF OOTHAM.      59 arms, that they might be instructed in all that pertained to men of war. 12. NoW Thub Ranch was given over to publicans and sinners. And there were many publicans there, but more sinners; for the publicans kept great houses for the sinners to dwell therein. 13. Yet were they but sojourners; for they came down every year in the summer to bathe and to purify themselves? in,the waters of the sea. And the women and the men puri- fied themselves together morning and evening; and when they went down into the water together to their purification, the women wore garments that begun low and ended high, like the garments of the dancing and singing women that they held in scorn in Gotham. ". Andeas they went down into the water, and while they purified themselves, and as they came up out of the water, all the other people which were not purifying themselves, gathered together and gazed at them; and there were scribes that as they looked upon them, wrote letters telling of their comeli- ness, and of the fashion of their garments, and of the manner of their purification, even as they did of the dancing and sing- ing women. 15. And it came to pass that if a scribe wrote in his letters that a woman at Thub Ranch was comely above where her garment began and below where it ended, and that her man. ner of purification caused her to find favor in the eyes of the men that went with her into the water, and of the multitude that gazed at her from the shore, that the scribe was made much of by that woman, and she bought his letters and sent them to her friends and acquaintances. 16. But of them that were at Thub Ranch only a few went thither for purification. And because it was hotter there than in Gotham, and the sun beat upon the sand without shadow of tree or of rock, the people of Gotham went there in the   60      THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. summer; and because it was full of turmoil and confusion, men of Gotham went there for rest when they were weary. And the people at Thub Ranch were given over to the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. 17. Wherefore Jemphrisc said, This is the place to which *I will take my soldiers, that I may train them in arms and teach them that skill in war-and in setting in battle array, whereof I knowr nothing.          ' 18. And Jemphrisc made a camp there, but the soldiers would not stay within the camp, but brake away and ran to the inns to drink wine with the publicans and sinners, and to the water-side to see the women purify themselves in gar- ments that began low and ended high. 1 9. Then did Jemphrisc run after them, and catch them, and bring them back to the camp, saying unto them, What mean ye by these doings? Have I not bought you and paid for you? And did I buy you to run out of the camp to drink wine with publicans and sinners, and to see women in the water? Nay, verily, but that ye might be seen of the women and of the publicans and sinners as my soldiers. 20. Wherefore he set, a guard over them to keep them. And when he had gone, the men and the guard went away together to drink the wine and see the women. 21. And it came to pass that on a day he drew out his troops in battle array, and marched before them on foot. 22. And he commanded them to march swiftly with their weapons levelled, as if they were running to meet a foe. And he himself ran- before them; and as he ran, men saw how it was that he had covered the chest that held the spoils of Cornelius, sitting upon it, because he ,grew large from the head  downward and from the feet upward and spread abroad. 23. And the day was hot; and Jemphrisc panted as he ran. And as he was running, behold, a wall rose up before   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.       61 him. And he said within himself, How shall I get over this wall? I cannot. Then would he have stayed his soldiers, but he had forgotten the word of command wherewith to stay them. 24. And he looked, and before him was the wall, and behind him were his soldiers running in battle array with levelled weapons. Then he threw up his arms and strove to ory out to them. But he stood before them speechless; and it seemed as if he would be lifted over the wall on the points )f their weapons. 25. But the chief officer under him, seeing his peril, ran out to him and cried that he should command the soldiers to halt. And he did so. And this was the manner of his teaching them to fight and to march in battle array. 26. And after these things, Jemphrisc broke up his camp and went back to Gotham. But now that he had learned to Cornmand his soldiers to march and to halt, he wished to go Lo Bosstown (which is the chief town of the world and the place around which the sun, and the- moon, and the stars do turn), that he might show the men of that city his soldiers, and his glorious apparel, and his war-horse that smelled the battle afar off, and his skill in making his men halt. 27. And he sent officers to the' governor of Bosstown, say- ng:' Bid me and my soldiers to visit you as men whom ye delight to honor, and make a feast for us; and the honor that ve do us shall cost you nothing; for I will pay therefor, after ;he manner of the men of Gotham, with the money that I have gotten by the great mystery of Tshee Tyng. 28. But the governor of Bosstown invited him not, and nade no answer,. But the governor of the. province where Bosstown was the chief city bade him So he went, he and :is soldiers. 29. And while he was in that city an exposition of prayer   62      THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. came upon him, and he sought a place where he and his soldiers might pray in battle array before the people. 30. Now there was a place in Bosstowh, in the middle of the city, which was called in the tongue of the men of that country the Kahmun.  And it was holy ground.   And they swore by it, so that was no oath to them so solemn as, by Bosstown Kahmun.   And men of other countries when they entered there must put off their shoes from their feet, lest they should profane that holy place.      / 31. And Jemphrise said to his soldiers, Let us go to the Kahmun and pray there, and we shall be seen by all the men of Bosstown, and moreover by the women. 32. And when the men of Bosstown heard that Jemphrise and his soldiers would pray on the Kahmun, they were dis-. mayed. And-)the governor of the city rent his clothes and put ashes upon his head; and he sent an officer to Jemphrisc, saying: Ye shall not pray on the Kahmun, you and your soldiers. It is an abomination.            '/ 33. Then Jemprisc said, Where then shall we pray? For thy servant is a devouti man; and his soldiers aie all devout men; and the great desire of our hearts is that we may pray daily, and chiefly on the Sabbath. (But in the speech of Bosstown they called it Sahbath.) 34. Then Jemphrise marched away from Bosstown, he and his soldiers; and as he-marched he prayed for the governor, and cried out dahmizize and dahmizole, after his custom of prayer. Wherefore thereafter he was called throughout the land of Unculpsalm the praying soldier, ' and his soldiers, the praying regiment, unto this day. , * -    -t   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.        63 CHAPTER   IV. 1.

For the people of Gotham and of the land of Unculpsalm chose their rulers; and it was the law that every man, without distinction of persons, should have a voice in the choosing. Which law was made when there were no Pahdees in that land, or few of them, and was made for the men of the land, whose fathers had wrested the land -from the king of the land of Jonbool, and -had built it up and made it a great land, a land of peace and plenty, and one wherein the laws were just, and judges were upright, and wrested not the law for lucre, and knew no distinction of persons. 3. And when the Pahdees came by thousands, and tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands, they also had, each one of them, his voice; and they and the men unto whom Athey joined themselves (which were of the sect of Smalphri among the Dimmichrats) chose the governor of the city, and the officers, and the judges, and -the council thereof, which, in the language of Gotham, were called Kahmuns Koundrils. Wherefore no man dared to gainsay them in doing what was right in their own eyes.. 4. And what they thought right was that they should have   '64      THE HRRONIULES OF GOTHAM o the money of that land, and the offices, and pour out drink- offerings ofjinnanshuger and ouiskee, and lay open the heads and rip up the bowels of them that were of a contrary opinion. 5. And if a man which was a Iangkie or a Gothamite said iunto a Pahdee, Why do ye who are strangers in a strange land seek to be officers and rulers thereof, and to put the treasury into the hands of men of your choosing?  It behoveth you to share the blessings thereof with us who have been willing that ye should do so, but to leave the ruling thereof to them whose fathers made the land a goodly land, and who have learned how to govern and how to choose their rulers from their youth up. Then the Pahdee answered, and said.: 6. Go to; because we have not money and offices in our own land, we have comeover here to get them. It was well that your fathers made the land a great land and a goodly, that we might come and take possession thereof, we and our priests forever. Stand aside; for we are the people, and we need none of your counsel. 7. Is not the voice of a Pahdee as good as the voice of a Gothamite or a Tangkie,.and is there not more of them? Therefore will-we have our own officers and our own judges, and they will take care that we shall do what is right- in our own eyes. And it was so. 8. Now on a certain day in every year, which was the day sacred to the god of Ouldayrin, the Pahdees joined them- selves together and marched through the streets of Gotham. And they took possession of all the great thoroughfares thereof; and this they did that, although they had taken pos- session of the land, they should not forget that they were Pahdees, and that the people thereof who, and whose fathers, had builded the city and made the glory thereof might see who were now their masters.   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.        65  9. And this was the manner of their marching. They clothed themselves in sad raiment, putting on coats of black, and nether garments of black, and hats of black upon their heads. For in their own country, even in Ouldayrin, they had none cf these things, but were clad in tattered garments of gray and hats of gray without form. For in that country only the chief men and they that were rich wore black gar- ments. o10. Wherefore the first desire of a Pahdee when he was come to Gotham was to clothe himself in black garments; and in his eyes they were a sign and a token that he was as good as any other man, and better. ". Thus it was that on their great day they clothed them- selves in sad apparel; so that there was never seen so many black coats and hats and nether garments in Gotham as on that day. But the coats did not conform to the nether gar- ments, nor did the hats to the heads of them that wore them, but sat upon the tops thereof, or fell down, and were held up by their ears from hiding their faces as a candle is hidden un- der a bushel; for verily the garments and the hats had been first made for other men. 12. And over their black garments they put green aprons, and they put scarfs of green about their necks, and in their hats they put green branches (for green was the sign and the token of Ouldayrin,) and they carried green banners, and on the banners were inscriptions whereof no man knew the meaning. 13. And when they marched their marching was not of one accord, for no man stepped like unto him that was next him, nor himself stepped twice alike, wherefore the black hats that were upon the heads of the Pahdees rose and fell like the floats of a fisher's net upon the waves.  ". And they filled the streets of Gotham so that the travel thereof stood still through the length and breadth thereof, and men could not go from one part of the city to the    "     THE CHRONICLeS Of GOTHAM. other. And the horses and the carriages of them that went on journeys and, of them that rode for pleasure, and the way- faring men on foot were stopped, or were turned into the alleys and the by-ways. 15. And so they marched through the streets, followed by their women and their children, not knowing why they began to march, or, whither they went, or when they would stop, only that they came out to make a procession. 16. For in Gotham. when a multitude started no whence and proceeded no whither, and prevented any one else from proceeding, that was called a procession. Wherefore, as the men of Gotham were merchants, careful in business and prudent in their affairs ,and orderly in all their ways, they gave up their streets continually to this manner of pro- cessing. 17. And so the Pahdees on the day sacred to the god of Ouldayrin proceeded no whither, and only processed, filling -the streets and stopping all the travel and. the business and the pleasure of the city with their processing. 18. And they processed past the great hall where the Kahmuns Koundrils met, and Hoaxumall, the governor of the city, came out before it that they might process past him And Hoaxumall clothed himself in green raiment from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot; doing this that he might--find favor in the eyes of the Pahdees. 19. For Hoaxumall said within himself, If they see me clad in the color of Ouldayrin they will think me green all through, as green as they are themselves; and they will accept me as a Pahdee dyed in the wool. Then shall it be fulfilled as it is written, With verdure clad, with strength arrayed. 20. Now the Pahdees who had taken possession of Gotham obeyed an High Priest that dwelt in a far country beyond the sea; and they believed, and worshipped qnd did in all things according as he bade them; for in his hands they   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.       67 deemed were the keys of heaven and of hell, and of the earth also. 21. And there were certain other men of Ouldayrin in that city, few in number, who believed not on this High Priest, and contemned his doctrine, and mocked at his authority. And these Pahdees were called Awrinjmin. And the former hated the latter, and the latter hated the former; so that there was no hatred so bitter as the hatred of these two sorts of Pahdees for each other. 22. And on a day when the Awrinjmin had assembled themselves together in their own place, they and their wives and their children to make a little feast, and the Pahdees were told thereof. Whereupon many of them came together with great tumult, crying out, Who are these Awrinjmin, that they dare to come together and make a feast in Gotham? Is not the city ours? We will not suffer them that they do this thing. 23. And they took stones and staves and arms, and they came down upon them and fell upon them, they and their wives and their children. And some of them they slew and many of them they maimed. This did they because they had dared to assemble and feast in Gotham, the city of the Pahdees. And they went unpunished. 24. For although it was the law in Gotham that all men should be free to worship, and to assemble themselves to- gether and to speak freely, whether of an High Priest or of a  chief ruler, yet this must not be done in a manner 'to offend the Pahdees, who were masters in Gotham. 25. Nevertheless the Awrinjmin were not affrayed; and the great spirit Bak Bohn entered into them, and the next year they declared that on their great day they would assemble without their wives and their children, and that they also would process, after the manner of Gotham, starting no whence and going no whither.   686      THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.: 26. And when the Pahdees heard this they were wrotlh, and they made preparation to assemble themselves together, and to fall upon the Awrinjmin while they were processing. And the people of Gotham  were troubled for fear that there should be bloodshedding and slaughter in their streets. 27. Then Hoaxumall caused the chief of the watchmen to put forth a proclamation, saying that the Awrinjmin should not assemble in the streets on that hay, because if they should process the Pahldees would fall upon them in their wrath and lay open th'eir heads and rip up their bowels, and slay them, and that it -was not to be suffered that the Pahdees should be thus angered and compelled to riot and to bloodshedding to keep them from processing. 28. But when the proclamation was read, there was an uproar throughout the city of Gotham and throughout the province thereof. For the people of Gotham were content that their treasury should be robbed and their judges cor- rupted and their whole city taken possession of by the Pahdees, and by the men chosen by the Pahdees, even by the name of Thu'r Ing; but that all men should not take posses- sion of the streets and thoroughfares and highways, that they might process from no whence to no whither, and for no pur- pose, they were not content. And the city was in turmoil. 29. Now in thesedays John, the son of Ophman, was gov- ernor of the province.' And he was a Dimmichrat, but not of the sect of Smalphri. And he saw that' Hoaxumall and the men of Thur Tng had gone too far in this matter in their sub- mission to the Pahdees. 'a  30. Wherefore, on that day he came to Gotham and took the city into his own hands, according to the powere that was his, setting Hoaxumall aside openly; and he put forth a proclamation,saying that all men that desired it should process -i         ]    THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.'      69 after the manner of Gotham, and that he would march his army into the streets to protect them in their processing. 31. Then were the people of Gotham content, and were glad in their hearts, and they said, Behold the glory of this city! the Pahdees may be our masters; the men of Thur Ing may rob us, and their corrupt judges may oppress us; but they may not cause any man of us to cease from processing. Great is John, the son of Ophman, and worthy to be gov- ernor! 32. And the Awrinjmin processed. And the soldiers marched before them, and behind them, and on either side of them. And the Pahdees came around them and reviled them, but they feared to fall upon them because of the sol- diers. 33. Then certain of the women of the Pahdees, which were called Bihdees, being more angry than the men and less fear- ful, cast stones and dirt at the Awrinjmin, and set on the men upon them that they should assault them in their pro- cessing. 34. Then the soldiers fell upon the Pahdees and slew some of them; and they fled and sta'yed not to look behind them; and there was a great slaughter. 35. And the Awrinjmin continued their processing until they came to an open space in the city, and there the soldiers be- ing before them and behind them and on either side of them they vanished and were seen no more; and no man knew whither they had gone. So they verily processed no whither; and the chief end of the government of the city of Gotham was accomplished. 36. Now one of the troops that John, surnamed Ophman, had commanded to protect the Awrinjmin was the praying troop, even the troop that Jeems, the son of Phrisc, the praying captain, commanded. 37., But Jemphrisc marched not at the head of his troop   70      THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. that day: For he said, Peradventure my soldiers may be behind me and the Pahdees may be before me, and I may forget the word of command, as it was aforetime; and in the turmoil it may come to pass that I may be wounded, so that I may no more be able to sit upon chests filled with spoils or on high in my chariot with my concubines, and that I may be wounded in mine honor before the people by mine own soldiers. 38. Wherefore he went not, but remained in the house which he had bought, that the dancing-women and the sing- ing-women might play before the people therein. And he sat there without his upper raiment; for the day was hot, and he would have been glad to lay off his flesh also like a garment. 39. Now the Pahdees were put to flight nigh unto the house where Jemphrisc was; and when he heard the noise he looked out, and behold, the Pahdees were fleeing in confusion. 40. Then Jemphrisc ran out and went to join himself to his regiment. And he looked not like a soldier, but only like a common man without an upper garment. So the Pahdees heeded him not; but in the tumult they ran over him and trampled upon him; and he laid himself down as one dead. ; 41. And certain of his soldiers raised him up and carried him into the house of a baker. Then certain boys gathered at the door to look in upon him. And when he saw them he cried, The Pahdees be upon me! and forgetting that he should seem like a wounded man, he rose quickly, and fled away by the back door. And when he was in the yard, be- hold, there was a wall before him; but he clambered over the wall. And behold, there was another; and thinking that the avenger of blood was upon his heels, he clambered over this one also; but behold, there was yet another. 42. Then did he wish for his soldiers to be there, that they might lift him over upon the points of their weapons, as he j   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.       71 had feared they would do at Thub Ranch. But he imagined he heard the voices of the Pahdees behind him, and he clambered again. 43. This did he five times, but still there was another wall before him, and he heard the voices of more of the Pahdees behind him. ' Nevertheless his heart failed him not altogether, for he saw a barrel standing nigh unto the wall. ". Then he mounted quickly upon the barrel, and as hie sprang up to clamber over this wall, the head of the barrel sank from beneath his feet, and he followed it. But he went not through the barrel, because he so broadened from his feet upward, and he was stayed by the part where he was largest,. So, he stuck fast in the barrel; and all his striving did but fix him the faster.                   - 45. Then as he was struggling did he indeed hear the voice of a Pahdee behind him, and his heart sankl down into thef; barrel, even below the part where he was largest; and he said to the Pahdee, Slay me not and thou shalt be one of the Durrektahs, and I will give thee some-dancing-women and some soldiers. V 46. Now the Pahdee was an ancient man and a feeble, and he knew not what a Durrektah was, and cared nothing for dancing-women or for soldiers; but he was a kindly man, and he helped Jemphrisc out of the barrel; and putting his shoulder to the broadest part of him he rose quickly and hoisted him over the wall; and then Jemphrisc, being filled with dread of walls and barrels and Pahdees, fled into the street. 47. And as he fled he saw Staycool sitting in a chariot with horses. And he leaped into the chariot, and it was driven furiously to the water side, where one of his ships lay. And he went on board and commanded, saying, Put off speedily, for the Pahdees are upon me, and they thirst for my blood. 48. Then thev put- off, and he was taken to Thub Ranch, J    ^ "  '   72     -THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. where he poured out drink offerings and gave thanks for his victory. And he sang a song, saying :! ". Bring branches unto me, for I am a conqueror; bring green leaves, for I have overcome the Pahdees; and sweet- smelling herbs, for I am the delight of women. 50. Put them into a cup, and pour thereon wine and strong drlink, even into a cup of crystal that may sparkle like unto the eyes of women; and put sugar therein, sweet like unto their kisses; and ice and hail that cometh down in storms,  terrible like my wrath. 51. L Bear it unto me, that I may) drink thereof as a victor drinketh, in honor of his victory. - And while I am drinking prepare me another, arid yet another, and bear them to me; lift them up before me, that they may be as incense unto my nostrils. a 52. And when men come asking, Where is Jeems, the con- queror? where is the son of Phrisc, that overcame the Pahdees? ye shall say, He drank victory like wine, and swallowed slaughter like strong drink ;i and he is gone where the woodbine twineth. , ,   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.       73 CHAPTER V. 1.

AND before these things it had come to pass that Bihl- tuede ascended into the Fifth Heavenue. 2. Now to ascend to a mansion in the Fifth Heavente was what the people of Gothlam longed for in their souls; and they labored therefor by day and dreamed thereof by night. And when a man who had been born and bred among the Bougheribois began to wax rich, his eyes and the eyes of his wife and of his daughters turned toward the Fifth Heavenue, hoping that they should dwell there. 3. For they thought that to dwell there was to be in Gothamj as nobles and princes are in other lands, and that they might look down as from thrones upon the women of the Bougheribois. And if they dwelt there these did look down upon those, and found their own happiness in their envy. 4. So when Bihltuede saw all the riches that he had gotten by the great mystery of Tshee Tyng, he knew the time had come for his translation to the abodes of the blest. 5. And he bought him an house, spacious and magnificent, and he filled it with carved work and with ceilings of gold and many colors, and with vessels of silver and gold, and with rich carpets woven by the weavers in the lands of Jonbool and of the Pahvoos. And his wife and his daughters were arrayed in garments of silk and of fine linen, and with jewels of gold and precious stones. And whereas the women of other men who had worn jewels and rich garments from their   74      THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. youth up were content to array themselves sumptuously for a feast, the women of Bihltuede, and also of the other men of Thur Ing, arrayed themselves sumptuously when they arose in the morning. And men said that they slept in silken gar- ments and declorated themselves for their bed-chamber with jewels. 6. Moreover he bought for himself horses and chariots, and he builded for himself stables; and the stables were decorated within with carved wood, very curious and very costly; so that there were many even of the rich men among those that paid money into the treasury of Gotham that were not lodged so sumptuously as the horses of Bihltuede. 7. And when Bihltuede looked upon all that he had done, and considered his riches and his power, and that he was one of the lawgivers of the province) and that the fortunes of the city of Gotham were in his hand, so that the rich men and the mighty bowed down to him, and prayed him to favor them in their business and affairs, and that he who had failed in his little, craft of chair-making, and had been a Bunkah among the Phyarmen, and had got his lodging by watching in the temples of the Phyarmen over Dummasheen, their god, and that he had done all this not by labor, or by- traffic, or by travail of any kind, but by being an Overseer in Gotham, and practising the great mystery, his soul was filled with pride, and he puffed himself up with the thought of his great glory. 8. And it came to pass that about Ithis time Bihltuede gave his daughter in marriage. And he made a great feast that he might show his magnificence to the people of Gotham, and'chiefly to the dwellers in the Fifth- Heavenue, even the Fuss people (for so were the people that dwelt there and in the regions round about called). This did he because he Paid within himself, When they see my glory and my magnificence they will admit me into their houses, and I and !   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.       75 my wife and my sons and my daughter will be even as one of them, and we shall ourselves be Fuss people. 9. Then did Bihltuede decorate ,his house for the marriage feast with gold and with silver, and carved work, and with hangings, and where there was not gold and silver and carved work and hangings, there were flowers taken from curious gardens that were green through all the year, winter and summer, so that his house bloomed like a garden of roses. 10. And there were minstrels playing in the hall upon stringed instruments, and upon sackbuts and trumpets; and the chief minstrel of Gotham played there to do honor to Bihltuede, and to receive his bounty. 1L, And tables were spread with sumptuous food, so that thousands of men might have eaten thereof, and wine was poured out unto them, so that they might have bathed them- selves therein. For as for water the men of Thur Ing used it not, either for drinking or for bathing. . 12. And his daughter was arrayed in silk and in fine twined linen, like unto the spider's web; and her outer garment was thrice as long as herself, even seven cubits and a span long, so that it continued behind her five cubits after she herself was ended. And the cost thereof was five thousand pieces of silver. And she twinkled with jewels, like unto the firmament with stars, and there were jewels of precious stones upon her feet; so that she bore a jewel for each one of her father's pursentojobbs, and for each time that he had practised the mystery of Tshee Tyng. 13. And as it was the manner of the Fuss people in Gotham to show unto their friends and acquaintance, not only their rich apparel that they wore, but that which they had pro- vided for themselves, so that men, and chiefly women, might know how much money they could spend for the adornment of their bodies. ". Therefore Bihltuede displayed the new garments of his   6 THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.0 -daughter with her jewels and adornments; and there was one that stood by to'set forth their number and their cost (for it was the custom of Gotham to value a woman accord- ing to the money spent on her appareD, and she said, Behold, the Boss's daughter is but two cubits and a span long, yet in this garment are seventeen cubits of silken cloth, and in this twenty cubits, and in the other twenty-five cubits; and the cost thereof is six thousand pieces of silver. And there were scribes admitted to write it down and to publish it to the people. 15. And all the day there came and went a great multitude to look upon the splendor of the house, and the apparel, and the jewels. But they were men of Thur Ing and their fol- lowers, and their women. And Gar Phee and Peter Bee- zoueni came among them. So they knew  whence all this was taken; and as they looked, they said within themselves, This came from that pursentojobb, and that was bought by such or such a- practice of the great mystery, and this jewel is taken from the quarry that furnished the st one for the judgment hall. 16. But they said nothing of this one to another, but they looked each one in the face of the other and were silent. For they knew that their own possessions had come to them in like manner, and in keeping the counsel of Bihltuede, they kept also their own. 17.' And many came to the marriage with presents, so that the multitude, and the cost thereof, could only be reckoned by SIipridic, the Treasurer; and the house was full of silver, and gold,'and jewels, and perfumes; and among all the per- fumes only one was wanting, even the sweet savor of a good name.                       - 18. And the treasury of Gotham paid for the presents; for they were given by the men ofThur Ing, and were themselves in the manner of pursentojobbs, by Gar Phee and by Thom-   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.  .    .7 pheels. M1oreover, Jemphrisc gave unto the bride a great vessel of silver, that was paid for by the men from whom he had taken the Query road. And Peter Beezoueni was there with a present also. 19. And the people of Gotham wondered; and said in their hearts, What will come of this? For there had never, been such a marriage feast and such sumptuous apparel seen in Gotham since it was a city.       s 20. And the sect of Smalphri said, Behold the glories of Thur Ing, and the blessings of the mystery of pursentojobbs, and of the greater ritystery of Tshee Tyng. Verily, great are those mysteries. And they looked for what should come thereafter. 21. Yet were the yearnings of Bihituede's heart, and of the heart of his wife and his daughters, unsatisfied, for when they looked they saw around them only their own sort, the men of Thur Ing, and the sect of Smallphri; and they knew in their hearts that they were not Fuss people.   7 8   ; '.THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.'

Now there was a law in Gotham, that the chief treasu- rer should once in every year write out an account of the money that he had received, and the money that he had paid, and publish it to all -the people. 2. But after a time there came a year when Slipridic pub- lished no account. And the people of Gotham went up every year to be taxed, and when they saw that the taxes were very grievous, and became-every year harder to bear, and when they saw that Bihltuede and Slipridic and the other men of Thur Ing waxed every year richer and richer, they said in their hearts, These men are extortioners, and their riches are taken out of the taxes-they lay upon us. 3. And'they cried out against Bihltuede and the men of Thur Ing, and chiefly  against Slipridic, saying, Publish now the doings of the treasury, and give an account of thy stewardship, that we may see who has our money, even these grievous taxes which are laid upon us every year. 4. But Slipridic made as if he heard them not; and yet another year went by, and his account was not published to the people. Wherefore they cried out the more against him and against Thur Ing. 5. Wherefore Slipridic took counsel with Hoaxumall, and he called together certain rich men who paid large taxes '" ' I  ' . .   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.      *9 -into the treasury (which men said, according to the law, might have been made larger), that he might use them to quiet the outcrying of the people. And these men were of the sect of Olephogees. 6. Now the Olephogees believe that it is better not to disturb that which is bad, lest it should be made worse. And most of them are well stricken in years, but some are young. For, verily some men are born Olephogees from their mother's womb. 7. And Slipridic bowed himself down before the Olepho- gees and said, My lords have done their servant honor in that they have come to examine the accounts of their ser- vant. Behold now the people cry out against me, and against the men of Thur Ing, saying, that the servant of my lords dare not render an account of his stewardship, because it is full of iniquity, and because the money of the people is taken to enrich the men) of Thur Ing. 8. Far be it from me to do this thing, or to increase the taxes of my lords, to make up any of that which is lacking. Look now upon these writings and consider them. 9. And he prtt before them certain books, and said unto them, Behold now, and see that these numbers being added together, do make the sum of those other numbers being also added together; even as six and four being added to- gether do make ten, and seven and three being added to- gether do make ten also. How then can my lords find any fiaud or iniquity in the stewardship of their servant? 10. And the Olephogees looked upon the writings, and be- hold, it was as Slipridic had said, and-the sum of the numbers on one side thereof was like unto the sum of the nnmbers on the other. And they said, Verily, Slipridic is without fraud or guile in this matter. And they signed a writing saying the same, and published it to the people; and the cry of the \ ^  '    -   ^   80     THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. people was stilled, and their jealousy and their anger were assuaged. ". But there was a certain scribe in Gotham, who gave no / heed unto the writings of the Olephogees, and he set it at nought, and cried daily, The men of Thur Ing are thieves. They rob the people, and they divide thre spoil. They are 'thieves, and they plunder the treasury. Thieves! thieves! thieves! 12. And he cried thus daily in Gotham, and in the country round about. But the people heeded not the voice of his crying. And some'said, This fellow crieth out because the men of Thur Ing are Dimmichrats, and he hateth the Dimmi- chratsa; and others said, He wisheth the men of Thur Ing to come unto him with persuasions. But most said only, He is aboah. 13. Now in the tongue of the people of Unculpsalm and of Jonbool, he was called aboah who told men verities that they were wearied of hearing. And from such a man they turned away more quickly than from a robber, a fool, or a profane person. So that it was worse to say of a man, he is aboah, than to say he is anathema. ";, Yet so it was, that although every man could see that another man was aboah, no man could see th"at he was aboah himself. And so many verities were told and brought to light that otherwise would have been hidden. 15. But the scribe heeded none of these things, and still he cried throutgh the city daily, and through the country round about, Thieves! thieves! thieves! 16.. Now there was a man -in Gotham, a Pahdee, and one of Thur Ing, whose name was Jemobrhine. And he had de- manded of -Slipridic that he should receive three hundred thousand pieces of silver as his share of the money that was gotten by the great mystery of Tshee Tyrng. 17.: And -Slipridic, -after he- had taken: counsel with Bihl-   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.       81 tuede, who was called the Boss, said unto Jemobrhine, No, I cannot pay thee three hundred thousand,.for that would be more than is justly thine. Wouldest thou iniquitously rob TTbur Ing? Be content; take three thousand. 18. But Jemobrhine refused, and he went away to his own house; and as he considered the matter, behold, his eyes were opened, and he said, Verily these men are thieves; for do they not keep from me my share of the money that is got- ten by the mystery of Tshee Tyng? 19. Then was the soul of Jemobrhine filled with righteous- ness, and his mind was bent on justice. And he said within himself, These men are puffed up, but they shall be brought down: they shall be punished for their sin, and contemned for their iniquity. 20. And when he heard the scribe crying thieves, and saw that no man heeded him, he suborned a man, a servant of Slipridic, and one that knew his doings; and the man-wrote down upon tables the money that had been paid unto them that were of Thur Ing,- even unto Gar Phee, to Kih Zur, and to Koh, the familar spirit of Bihltuede, and to the rest; and the man brought it to Jemobrhine; and Jemobrhine gave it to the scribe. 21. Then the scribe published it to the people, and cried aloud, Give ear, O men of Gotham, and hear, and read also with your eyes! Here be writings that show how ye are defrauded, and that the rulers of the city are the robbers of its treasury. Thieves! thieves! thieves! 22. And the men of Gotham read the tables, and'they saw that it was so, even as the scribe had said; and they were wroth with the men of Thur Ing, and their anger was hot against them. And they cried out with one voice, Let Slip- ridic render an account of his stewardship, or these writings shall be witnesses against him, and we will take them as his accounts. We will be no longer put off with-promises.   82      TTHE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. 23. Then Hoaxumall remembered him of the Olephogees and of the writing which they had signed, saying that Slip- ridic was without guile or friaud; and he bethought him of another and yet a stronger certifying. 24. Now there was in Gotham a congregation of Olepho- gees, which was the chief synagogue of that sect, and which in the tongue of that country, was called the Shamers of , Kommurz. And the odor of Olephogee filled the synagogue of the Shamers of Kommurz, so that if a man who was not an Olephogee entered therein, and breathed it, he straight- way became an Olephogee, and knew it not. 25. And it was the custom of the Shamers of Kommurz, when anything happened that they understood not, to assem- I, ble themselves together, and be a committee thereon (as it is written that men called themselves a commhittee, because nothing had been committed unto them), and to publish to  the world solemnly their opinions. 26. Wherefore Hoaxumall said, I will get the Shamers of Kommurz into the toils of Slipridic, and he shall go through the mysteries of his office before them, until they shall believe that three may be taken from two and there shall five remain. And they shall sign a writing, and publish it, that Slipridic is just and righteous enough to have saved Sodom from de- struction. 27. And he made proclamation to the people, saying: Have patience, and the Shamers of 'Kommurz shall make examination of all the accounts of Slipridic, and publish their judgment to you. 28. Butu thereupon the people were more wroth than be- fore, for they remembered the former writing of the Olepho- gees; and they laughed Hoaxumall to scorn, and would have none of his certifyings, or of his Olephogees, or his Sham-ers of Kommurz. 29. And they cried out against him, anu said, Go to now:   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM,      83 This is not what we require of thee. It is not that these lines of words may be like unto those lines, and that, being added together, these figures may be like unto those figures. Behold, that may be made to appear by any scribe, cunning to write in the books of the merchant. 30. Yea, verily, did not Phernandiwud do the same when he dealt with Mahravine, and his walk was slantindicular? and when he owed Mahravine one hundred, he took his bills and wrote fourscore; and when Mahravine owed him fifty, he wrote one hundred? 31. But where, O Hoaxumall, be the chairs, and the tables, and the carpets, and the curtains; where is the plasterer's wrought work, and where are the iron pipes, and the leaden pipes, and the wash-bowls, and the other hollow vessels; and what- are the services of the multitude of men, like unto an army of caterpillars, for the payment whereof thou hast signed thy name as a warrant unto Slipridic, the Treasurer? 33. Show unto us the things, and not the names of the things and the prices thereof, written by scribes upon paper;- and show us the work that hath been done by the multitude whose wages have been taken from us by taxes. 33. Show us the plaster that. Ghar Phee, the plasterer, hath plastered, that we may see if all the city of Gotham may contain the same. 34. Bring out the chairs of Sinkusall and of Koh, that we may see them, and sit ourselves down upon them, leaning back therein; and the tables, that we may set up our feet there- on. 35. Lay before us the carpets, for which Sinkusall hath been paid, that we may lie down thereon, and walk thereon, and spit thereon, as our custom is in Gotham. 36. Show unto us the iron pipes and the leaden pipes, and the wash-bowls of Kih Zur, and the other hollow vessels, that we mnay use them before the Lord. These be the things   8i      THE CHRONICLES. OF GOTHAM. that we require of thee, that thou mayest justify thyself, and the signing of thy name as a warrant for the payment there- of; even these'things themselves, and not the books written by Khonnullee, whose surname is Slipridic. 37. And they were exceeding wroth; and they gathered themselves together in -the hall of Peter the Barrel-maker, and they made orations to each other; and some said one thing, and some another; and some said, Let us take Bihl- tuede, and Hoaxumall, and Slipiridic, and Peter Beezoueni, and hang them up before the new judgment hall, by means of which they have robbed the people. And the city was in an uproar. 38. But a certain man entered into the judgment hall, where Abarnah, the judge, was sitting, and went before him and accused the men of Thur Ing of stealing the money of the people, and prayed him to unjunct them that they might pay no more money out of the treasury. 39. Now Abarnah, the judge, saw that the days of Thur Ing were numbered. Wherefore he granted the man's pray- er, and unjuncted them. For he said within himself, It be- hoveth me now to make friends of the enemies of my friends, that I may not go down with them to destruction. 40. And the doings of Abarnah filled the people with amazement and rejoicing;- for they said Abarnah knoweth on which side .f his bread is the butter thereof. Behold he is going backward on them that put him forward. Is not Thur Ing unjuncted? ". And when Hoaxumall heard this, his heart sank within him, and his countenance fell; for although he had not taken unto himself any of the spoils that had been gotten by the mystery of Tshee Tyng, he knew that he had given his name to be used in the practice of that mystery. Yea, verily, and whatever man was in Thur Ing, or was one of them that   THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.      '85 governed Gotham, or was a judge, or a lawgiver, or a' ruler therein, must needs wink at the practice of that mystery. 42. Thenh Hoaxumall took counsel with Bihltuede, and said, What shall we do? for Slipridic hath the papers given unto him for a warrant, and he keepeth them to be a witness against us. And they said, Verily, we must persuade him to -give up the treasuryship for the sake of Thur Ing, and for the sake of our sect of the Dimmichrats, even of Tahmunnee, and moreover for the sake of his share of the spoils gotten by the mystery of Tshee Tyng. 43. And Hoaxumall wrote Slipridic a letter, persuading him, and saying that he would gain honor by giving up the treasuryship. But Slipridic would not be persuaded, and sent back a letter saying, Thy servant doth not see it. ". Now Slipridic was a crafty man; and when he saw that Ho6axumall and Bihltuede sought occasion against him, and that they were going backward upon him, and would offer him up as a sacrifice to the wrath of the people, and also get possession of the papers that were witness against them, he sought out a man that he might make him his deputy accord- ing to the law of Gotham, and put the treasury and all things relating thereto'into his hands. 45. And he found Andrew, who was surnamed the Verdant, a just man and an upright, who was a Dimmichrat, but not of the sect of Smalphri. ". And he made him his deputy, and sent word to Hoaxumall saying, Behold, I have given mine office and all that pertaineth thereto unto my deputy, Andrew the Verdant; and now is the treasury of the city safe and sure. For, even as thou thyself hast said aforetime, it is written, In verdure clad, in strength arrayed. 47. And the men of Thur Ing were sore dismayed when they saw Andrew the Verdant, in the place of Slipridic, the treasurer.  And Hoaxumall said, This man shall not sit in   86      THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM. thd treasury in the place of Slipridic. Am I not governor of 'the city? But his protesting was of no effect; for in this Slipridic had the law upon his side. 48. Wherefore dread fell upon these men, and a fearful looking for of judgment to come; and they began to hide their possessions; and some of them fled into far countries; and Thur Ing was broken and scattered abroad. ,49. But Bihltuede fled not, for he was a bold man, and moreover he knew the power of his riches. And Slipridic remained also to reveal the secrets of Thur Ing; for he hoped thereby to avenge himself upon Bihltuede and Hoax- umall and to purchase his own safety. 60. And Hoaxumall said, What is this to me? Did I not wash my hands of this matter? Was Pilate removed from his governorship? 48. Then Andrew the Verdant made search in the treas- ury; and he found evidence against Bihltuede, and against Slipridic, and against one Thompheels, a lawgiver, against Sinkusall, and other men of Thur Ing. And- the judges 'de- livered Bihltaede and Slipridic and Thompheels to the officers to cast them into prison. But the judges took sureties for Bihltuede and for Thompheels; and Staycool, the friend of Jemphrisc, was surety for Bihltuede. For all these men had been in Thur Ing together. But for Slipridic no surety was found, and he was cast into prison. 52.: And it came to pass that at the time when these things were done, the day came when the people of Gotham should choose their lawgivers, their judges, and their counsellors; and there was a great commotion./ And they choose the men that were enemies of Thur Ing, and them that were not of the sect of Smalphri among the Dimmichrats. 53. Nevertheless they chose Bihltuede, and Thompheels, and Jemobrhine to be lawgivers. -And these only they chose but of all them that were of the sect of Smalphri among the 7 ,    THE CHRONICLES OF GOTHAM.      87 )immichrats. Because Bihltuede and Thompheels were robbers, and had been given by the judges into eustody of the officers to be cast into prison; and Jemobrhine was a traitor who had betrayed his companions, because they would not give him his share of the spoil gotten by the great mystery of Tshee Tyng. Even these they chose; for such is the manner of the men of Gotham. 54. And still the scribe went through the city and the region round about crying, Thieves! thieves! thieves! and the chief of all the thieves is Hoaxumall, who yet remaineth governor of the city. 55. And of the end of Jemphrisc and of Staycool, and of Bihltuede, and Slipridic, and Hoaxumall the governor, and of the coming of the Granjewk to Gotham, and of the doings of certain women who had a quarrel with their Maker because they could not be men and would not be women, behold, all these things are written in the third book of the Chronicles of Gotham, to be published abroad to all people and all nations.
