His age and crabbed temper were not taken into account, anymore than his harsh, selfish disposition, and cold, crustj manners; his - worldly goods were the only charm, and they weighed heavily in the balance with farmer .Bassford. He was by no means ignorant of these disagreeable traits in Luke's unenviable character; for, beside being pretty thoroughly -known throughout the entire neighborhood, they were legibly stamped on his grum, dark face, and were unplea- santly echoed in his low, icy tones. Bomily was a-woman who never had a will of her own, and meekly bowed to the opinion of others, as if'it were 'quite impossible for her to do otherwise; and when her father explained to her in the most plain and emphatic terms that she could not do better than marry Luke Ethinger, the poor girl felt there was no escape, and she must unmurmuringly submit to the older and wiser judg- ment of her parent, whose word was law with his wife. and children, and whom she never ventured to disobey or oppose. Then it was shebremembered the many sad things she had heard of Luke's buried wife. How she was a delicate little woman, who had married him for love, and died -five, years afterwards, they said, of a broken heart. The doctors gave it another name, and called it-consump- tion; but Emily recollected bhearing it whispered that Jani (Ethinger never seemed happy after she was married, and grief and disappointment brought on a slow decline, anid so0 she- quietly died one cheerless spring day while Luke-was busjoat-the tannery. It was rather unexpected,l although she had been ailing so long, and both Mr. Eth- ingter and his maiden sister Rebecca complained: the day   HELEN   ETHNGER.        15 of the funeral, that it was. a singular perversity on. the part of Jane to drop off in that sudden manner, without saying to anybody she was worse. Poor censured Jane had been dead some years now, and lay peacefully at rest in the village church-yard, unconscious of Luke's stern coldness, and grim old Becky's endless blame. The two children she left him soon followed her, and with them, low down in the grass beside her mother and babes, she slept well. Emily thought *f all this in shrinking dismay, almost believing she saw her own fate in the narrow, neglected- mound where slumbered Luke Ethinger's first wife, if she became his second; and asked herself help- lessly how she could avoid it. She certainly would not marry him for love; but might not her Wieart break all the same? How could she ever endure, life in his frown- ing company; how ever unite her young existence with his sour middle-age? Emily was a healthy, handsome, sunny-tempered, industrious girl, quite unlike pale,-slen- der, inert Jhne, and she pleased the gruff widower as greatly as such a vinegary temperament was capable of being pleased, but to her it was a bitter, bitter alterna- tive-the giving up of Earle Armitage and the accept- ing of Luke Ethinger.  In 'disposing of her hand, Mr. Bassford did not consult his daughter's heart, which exclusively belonged to Earle Armitage, a gentleman the very opposite of Mr. Ethitnger j in wealth and disposition. He was wholly ignorant of the true state of Emily's 'affections, and had it been-the contrary, it is quite sure his language would have been' still more forcible andsimperative in favor of Luke and his suit. He fully realized the evident fact that Luke was not impeccable, and Becky was not an angel, but old-': fashioned houses full of old-fashioned furniture, and pros- perous tan-yards are not offered every diy to girls whose ,      .   16   .   HELENETHNGER. father works a farm; and in his paternal zeal to secures' her an enviable settlement in life, Mr. Bassford entirely forgot to provide for his daughter's happiness. That was a small matter compared to seeing her " well established," and the minor details necessary to a wife's home-content- ment and bliss, he did not think it worth while to bother himself about. Earle Armitage, in the relation of a son- in-law, was less likely to please him than any young-nan in Bergen, simply because he was penniless, to which the sturdy farmer 'made bold to add the word shiftless, and ;accuse I m of showing no disposition to get along. Not that he anticipated any such relationship, or suspected Emilylwas fond of him, but that was his general estimate of him, expressed in a free, unbiased way; and his eldest daughter had good cause to inwardly tremble when obliged to listen to his frequent and unsparing comments which were/so adversely direct against the growing homage of her heart. Earle was a fine-looking young man of twenty- three, with handsome brown eyes, and hair a shade darker than his eyes.' A tall, broad-shouldered, lovable fellow, so very, very different from short, spare, unlovable Luke. What a pity ie- should be so poor and shiftless! How distressful to remember his father was only a wag6n- maker, and thatt Earle refused, point-blank, to work in the -shop. He; might be persuaded to do a little fancy painting now and then, to finish up some particular fine vehicle, but that was about the extent of his application, and as a wagon-maker, he was undoubtedly a failure. He: did not, like the trade; in fact, he did not like any trade, and immensely enjoyed hanging around and being systematicallyI ile. At least, so the majority of people said who klew him, and decidedly of the majority was Mr. -Bassford. Unaware of Emily's secret predilections, he merely uttered the common verdict of every one else, !    -       ,r   HELEN ETH INGER'.;         17 and otherwise had no especial animosity pledged against the improvident wagon-maker's son. At this time Mr. Armitage's accomplishments consisted mainly in writing the, most beautiful hand in the world,. so Emily thought,-such graceful curves as he could make, and then the lovely flourishes with which he always em- bellished his name, drew from her the deepest admiration. She had half-a-dozen of his, signatures appended to as many dear little notes locked snugly away in her little paper-covered trunk up-stairs, and how often she read and re-read them, the foolish, foolish girl, and secretly loved the indolent hand that wrote them. Earle's single talent was a desultory genius for painting--not wagons, but on canvas, grand ideal conceptions of a life more- sublime" than could be found in the village of Bergen, and of nature more splendid and rare than its simple people could comprehend, His brain teemed with exqui- site dreakmpictures, and he longed to reproduce them in visible form. It was this constant inner existence of un- developed, unoccupied imagination - and a terribly hard, perplexing master it is, too,--that made him seem so idle, and won for him the unflattering appellation among his associates of being constitutionally lazy. So far his genius had not reached higher than the battered siding of the old district school-house, where traces of his jack- knife yet lingered in many a deep, age-gray defacement. / Emily fondly remembered, in compliment to his-markred juvenile propensities, several pencil - sketches of impos-: sible landscapes on the cover of his neglected atlas, and some remarkable cows in chalk forcibly drawn  on the black-board ; 'nor did she forget his early chiaroal- eifiorts profusely depicted on convenient barn-doors andlneigh- boring board fences, and all of which she sincerely believed pointed to his final greatness. But alas for her partial 2* ..    18      HELEN ETHNGER. hopes I Earle- was twenty-three, and had attained the longed-for dignity of pallet and brush, but his trees still had a queer look, generally appearing taller than his sky, and no natural cows ever had such wooden legs, and kept their tails in such a dreadfully unsymmetrical twist, as his innovating genius would have it; and surely no living horse ever capered in the extraordinary attitude he stood them up in onl canvas, portraying astride them such a knight as was never seen by mortal eyes, and surround- ing them by scenery equally amazing as the steed and the knight. Yet she tried to fancy he was making rapid pro- gress,- and so he was -in a doubtful way. However, the germ was there, foreshadowing the one paramount desire of his soul-, and his hopes and dreams -clung round it with undiminished earnestness and faith. Thus it happened that when Luke presented himself as a suitor, Earle already possessed Emily's heart inde- pendent of her father's approbation; and one moonlight evening in May, beneath the weird shadow of a crooked old gpple-tree near the garden-wall, amid the hush of twilight and the- noiseless fall of white blossoms, he told her how dearly he loved herShe listened in love's shy, pleased silence, and then franlly whispered back how der he was to her. True, he had no money, and his prospects were not brilliant, but Emily did not heed it, and ;his kiss upon her lips was just as sweet for all his poverty.' He spoke so bravely of the future, and felt so confident of being able to correct the crudities of the in- comprehensible steed, and the equally incomprehensible knight, that Emily thought her father's consent not so hard to obtain as she at first had feared. Earle said he would go to work now in real earnest, and in three years he would have saved enough to commence life on--a pretty cottage home near some pleasant city- and theu V   .       t    HELEN ETHNGER.-         19 he could boldly ask Mr. Bassford for his daughter. So reasoned hopeful youth; so planned sanguine love; and how tenderly they cherished the poor fragments of that shattered dream through all the disappointments and toil and sorrows of later years. Mr. Bassford had not the slightest knowledge. of art, and esteemed artists a shabby lot not worth their salt. It wa r all nonsense; and the idea of his daughter caring for this shiftless Earle never entered his stupid head. What did he know of love, as those two young beings interpreted it under the apple-tree; what of the charm of moonlight, bud, and leaf? Nothing at all.. He did not woo Emily's mother in that silly way, and he had no cause to suppose that her daughter was in the habit of favoring Mr. Armi- tage by granting him romantic clandestine meetings at ao time when the friendly dusk rendered tall objects obscure down by the garden wall. But so it was, and aneath the dense still shade of the gnarled old tree, with white flower leaflets falling like perfumed snow-flakes at her feet, and her glad dark eyes bent on the petal-starred ground, her ear drank in the sweet, sweet confession of a first love, and when she crept back over the garden wall she had forever given her heart away. Her hand might not fol- low - it seldom does - but certain it is, Earle Armitage had her steadfast and undying affections from that hour, notwithstanding Luke Ethinger and his subsequent claims, the premonition of which she was that night to-3 know, and from which she was to date the beginning of her life's calamity. Elnily entered the house with unusually bright eyes and flushed cheeks, to behold her father sitting at the supper-table, eating dreadfully of cold corned beef and cabbage. The brightness and color instantly faded, and Earle 'and love and apple-blossoms shrank down into the ,f - ,    ,  a   20      HRELEN ETHNGER. inmost centre, of her heart, no more to bloom in happy radiance on her fair young face. Peter Bassford, in his ihirt-sleeves, with his bare, brawny, sunburnt arms rest- ing on the table, and his stolid features moving in unison f to the solid appreciation he had of corned beef,:was riot a particularly pleasing contrast to the picture filling her mind. , It was a rude unexpected shock, and the tough awakening from dear romance to stern reality, stun"ned " and alarmed her beyond words. Mr. Bassford was a maan- . of exceedingly dull perceptions, and having no fine sensi- bilities of his own, he accredited none to anybody else, and was no more capable of understanding a gentle, sen- sitive nature like Emily's than he was of laying the At- lantic cable. To a person of refined discernment,.her eyes spoke volumes of all that was most sacred and dear and precious to a woman, and on this delicate, strange spirit, so beautiful and holy to the breast wherein it was but newly shrined, the rough language of her uncouth father jarred cruelly. "Well, Emily," said he, shoving back from the table as:she entered, and clumsily. wiping his fingers on the corner of the table-cloth in lieu of a napkin. "Well, Emily, I'm glad you've come in. I 've just been-, llin' mother about it, and she thinks, as I do, that it's a -mighty good chance for you." - iEmily opened her eyes wide in wonder, and remained expectantly silent. i ' He is sort of queer in his ways, don't say much; but you'd get used to him after a while," abstrusely continued Mr. Bassford. :'d Get used to whom?" asked Emily, knitting her brow in perplexity.- - , Why, to Luke Ethinger. He came over to the corn- lot, to-day, on purpose to soundme about it; and I told o.       e .ou i  ad   lHELEN -ETHNGER.         21 him out and out I was willin'; for I thought it a good thing for you," said the farmer, scarcely less obscurely. Emily looked completely mystified, and ejaculated in a bewildered tone: "I don't clearly understand-Luke Ethinger; why, what earthly reason have I for getting used to his ways?" "The best reason in the world, seen' he cum clean up to the corn-lot to inquire of me if I thought you'd marrye him-; and I candidly told him I thought you would," said Mr. Bassford, with an air of having done something handsome. "What!"Emily's color was now quite gone, and she turned on him a mingled look of incredulity and alarm. "It's a fact," said he, complacently leaning back in his chair, and closely scanning the dingy ceiling like a man sensible of a great compliment. "I marry Luke Ethinger?  What an absurd proposi- tion^ I scarcely know him, and he is twice my age, lnd I heartily dislike him even as an ordinary acquaintance," she replied, her pale lips and startled eyes sadly at va- riance with the forced smile glimmering like a mocking shadow on her pallid face. "Tut, tut, girl; you don't know what you are talking about," said he, attempting a playful manner. "Luke's well to do; a little oldish and odd, but that's nothing to mind; and I reckon he'll improve on acquaintance.- He has been here several times of late, and girls a'n't slow to take the hint when it's a widower as comes shyin' around. They allers mean business; and you may depend Luke did A not come to borrow the plough and the hay-cutter for nothing. I  guessed it then; and his comin? up. to the corn-lot this afternoon settles the thing." The farmer laughed at his neighbor's neat shrewdness, and gave Luke credit for having inaugurated his courtship in a remark- ably clever style.   HELEN ETHNGERo Hurt, surprised, and alarmed, Emily abruptly quitted the room and sought the seclusion of her own gartet apartment at the top of the house, in a maze of bewilder- ment aid dread. The loan of the plough and the hay- cutter, however it may haVe struck the astute Mr. Bass- ford, had not aroused her suspicions, though iuke was a widower, and took dinner there on both of those fatal pccasionis. She had helped him to peach dumplings, and never once suspected the subtle purpose of his errand, or : whither the cheerful hospitality of her father tended. And oh, how humiliating and agonizing thenbitter-knowledge that whil 3 she was impatiently awaiting the dusk and Earle, and the ever sweet repetition of his love, Luke was coolly negotialing for her ihand in the corn-rot, and her father, contentedly leaning on his hoe, was kindly assuring Mr. Ethinger that he should have Emily if he had any in- fluence t) bring her around.  It is needless to dwell on the painful theme. Mr. Bass- ford carried his point, and Emily was finally brought around. $She cried, and implored, and protested, of :course; and when it came to this her father beased per- i.. slading, and strenuously commanded her unequivocal I-S :, obedience to' his wishes.?

We are so poor!" was her appealing cry. "We have noth- ing, and they are so fixed and stern. - Oh, Earle, be gen- tie with me, for my heart is breaking '  He did like all young men in his desperate situation; he cursed himself for being a beggar ;-said her fither was a selfish old bigot, or something to;that effect; and declared Luke to be a stolid old scoundrel, who ought to be hanged for killing one wife by, inches, instead of allowing him to take another, with a view, no doubt, to murdering her in the same slow way. He accused her of being weak, culpably childish and spiritless, and when anger and indignation had burned itself out, he stood moody and silent, the image of despair. And she only moaned in reply:  ' I could not help it, Earle; indeed, I could not help., it I I begged to be spared from that dreadful cynical old Luke, but father would not listen to me.

Oh, it was cruel, eruel: A fresh burst of grief came with the thought, and she lelg to him with all her trembling strength, as if a worsethan death was in the sacrifice. He tried tq comfort her 'an  HELEN  ETH[NGER. 9    -      X smoothod her soft dark hair with gentle caressing fingers,-- a slow pitying touch that she remembered years after- wards, and, which came to her like a blessing when her cross aas heavy, and the way rough and thorny fci her weary, faltering feet. He kissed down the eyelids above the fast welling tears, and the sigh on her tremulous lips met its death on his own. Hushed and exhausted, faint and dizzy from excitement and sorrow, she was only half con- scious of her misery, and now was the time to say good-bye. Both were fearful that the sick, despairing silence would not last; born of a great emotion; it was not to be trusted, and he nerved himself to say farewell, and forever, to the girl he loved better than anything on earth. - And in: that long, passionate embrace, so fraught with anguish, regret, and love, Emily resigned her dream of happiness, and :Earle bade; adieu to his life's fair hope. The en- chanting vision had vanished, and joyless. and barren stetched the dreary road of existence ahead. It was a woeful parting, and she slipped from his arms white and :trembling, to run half-blinded by her tearsito her room, antd there cry all night because they were no more to :met again. lEarle watched her out of sight; saw her flit atlog the garden wall one moment: in the broad moon* light, and the next gliding in the shadow of the slender plumtrees lining the path, until her form became only a d:immbVing outline, which soon disappeared within the gloom bangle of the wood-shed, and she was gone. Then he: swly turned away, muttering malefetions on Luke ahngerand Peter Bassford, aind breathng one deep, lbonugdrawn sigh over the pitiful ruins of his blighted -hopes,;and left the spot a sadly changed anc bitterly dis- :alppointed man. He walked down to hit father's shop, wherethe day's busy hum had ceased, let himself in by a burglarious forcing of the little window at the back, and   HELEN ETHNGER.   surrounded by an innumerable array of spokes, tires, thills, and like indications of the trade, sat down to think it over and decide upon the best course to pursue. And while Emily was crying her heart out to the darkness, Earle passed the night in gnawing his lip and wishing the afflictions of Job might be visited upon Luke. He had no right to separate them. It was unjust, cruel, and wicked; but if it were, he must submit, and not give way to useless repining; and the morning found him resolved to bear his trouble manfully- resolved to win for him. self a name. Two days afterwards he suddenly Quitted Bergen, to the infinite surprise of the village, who mag- nanimously concluded that he had some "spunk" after all; and all Emily had left of him was a faded ambrotype in a weak-jointed case, a few letters and sketches, and  the precious memories of those -summer evenings spent under the motionless boughs of the old apple-tree. And. the picture and letters and sketches were sacredly looked at, kissed, and treasured the wretched day she became Luke Ethinger's wife. But who could hold it a sin/    ; against her, or say she wronged by it the husband she never loved? Far more she wronged the affection that was crying out against the mockery of empty vows and lawful perjury.               . Luke paid his addresses in a decidedly cool and method- ical manner, greatly to Emily's relief, whose conversation was always in monosyllables and on very geneml topics. He came every Sunday at a stated hour; and how she- dreaded that hour, and, above all, the man! The family, having due respect for the privacy of engaged people, di-: ' creetly avoided the parlor-rag carpet, papel shade, .ae: seated chairs, and chintz lounge: Mr. Bassford 'onl /  Deacon Hooley's farm, remember-when Luke apea 8,                       ':'.    -26     -HELEN   ETHNGER. and Emily was left to entertain him quite as- a matter of course.  Mr. Ethinger was a man, even then, slightly gray along the temples,with a tuft of black whiskers on his long chin, and a lean, long face that was never seen to wear a sbmile. His dark, bilious complexion began to show the footprints- of age, and his bluish-black eyes bespoke a cold, surly, dominant nature, the uncertainty of color aizd fixedness. of expression making them anything but agreeable eyes to encounter under any circumstances, and the deep wrinkle that lay between them, on a range with his large, pimpled nose, gave to his forehead the aspect of a perpetual frown. He walked with his hands hanging straight by his side, and looked at a distance like an animated post in search of a location. He drove a dappled gray mare named Folly, in contempt of her gender, probably, and when seated in his narrow-backed, uncomfortable little buggy with Folly well in hand, he impressed one as being the perfect embodiment of a self- sufficient and experienced domestic tyrant, which he truly -was in the most arbitrary and unpalliating sense. , The sight of Folly trotting briskly-.around the corner - djmade Emily fairly shiver, and her heart sink, like lead in -her bosom. Her first impulse was to run away, the second to cry, and the third-the inevitable one-to endure; and this she did in a meek, apathetic way, and uncom- plainingly let things take their course towards the life- long martyrdom which she knew awaited her. Luke was so distressingly deliberate in all his move* ments, that you pight imagine him a rule in constant measurement of his own acts. All1 the warmth- of hue manity seemed to have turned into acidified regularity in his nature, and there was little likelihood of its ever ing counteracted by a sweeter gredient. He hitched   HELEN ETHNGER.          27 his horse with a precision that was actually painful, and ' bowed himself in at the door with an air of indescribable supercility and stiffness, which never unbent however mollifying was the occasion, and was always the same whether his mission be love or business. His low, rasp- ing voice had something unpleasantly dogmatical in it and he whistled his curt questions and short answers through his teeth, with a tightness of lips and a sullen stillness of features that confounded and frightened poor, timid Emily. At his most amiable best, Luke was a wretched conversationist ;, his principal discourse being a misty mingling of personal importance,and self-apprecia- tion, with a slight tendency to business confidences if pursuance of her anticipated wifely copartnership, frag- mentary allusions to the weather, a possible drought- tan-bark, leather, hides, and so-forth, all of which were quite meaningless to her; but she tried to look interested and not afraid, though it can hardly be said she-suc- ceeded, for she kept the length of the chintz lounge be- tween them  and her eyes absently riveted on the rag  carpet. The solitary gleam  of pleasure she experienced  in his company wals when he arose to depart, and the look of intense relief with which she saw the gate shut after -  him, and heard Folly's quick hoofs clattering homeward - again, argued ill for her ever getting used to Luke's odd  ways. "Bid of for seven days at least," was her thankful  mental comment, and she was to marry the man, God  help her in two-months.   HELEN ETHNGER.  CHAPTER II. WHO IS ANSWERABLE? C EVER was there a more common-place wedding L than that of Emily and Luke. There was nothing f affection, romance, or beauty in it; a hard, dull, prac- cal affair from first to last, without a single tender sen- iment or one redeeming charm, She was simply passive, nd let them arrange it as they pleased. Her heart seemed aralyzed; hope was dead; and since Earle was gone, that did it matter! -When the day came for her to make good her promise, he went up to her room and calmly set about preparing o meet it like one nerved to undergo a great trial of iand and body. She was strangely composed, more so han her- sister Julia; who came up to help her dress and fix her hair," as she said. Emily submitted to her sis- er's taste and skill, sitting silent and motionless while he braided her dark, abundant hair and artistically astened in it a few white rose-buds. -Poor, Emily! her heart had died out there under the Lpple-tree, and her face, blank and set as a stone, turned Qoward its fruit-ladened top, visible through the open winaiw, as if it must know how unutterably she was suf- rings Jiulias compassionate nature was touched, for he had many secret misgivings concerning this incon- gruent marriage, and from her own insuperable spirit nd- firmness she sought to encourage her weaker sister. ;I w::iwould not mind, Em. Just assert your rights on the start, and give him to understand you won't put up with his snarl and his thunder-cloud. WereI: in your i fh - ,t u   HELEN ETHNGER.         29 place, in less, than a week I'd have him to know I was not to be trampled on by any means. I would find a tongue, and, if necessyd nails, wherewith to combat his particular Satan, and enforce my new dignity. As for. ,Becky-let me advise you.- settle her with one good quarrel. Convince her at the earliest opportunity that you are mistress, and if it does not suit her temper, give her theimmediate privilege of seeking quarters elsewhere." / Which was very sensible advice; but Julia did not know anything about Earle, and so Emily only shook her head and said, wearily:. "I have not your strength of character, Julia. I was not born with it, and I cannot acquire it. Becky has. little to fear from either my tongue or nails .and, Luke-- well, I suppose I shall live through it somehow. I am young and strong, and not likely to die for some years., "I hope not," replied Julia, her thoughts still belliger- ent. "But it would not take me long to get the upper hand, and keep it, too;" and Miss Julia looked every inch as if she was quite able to maintain the assertiont. "Never mind; I 'll not caution too strongly now.- WS it and see how they act, and if you can't manage-Madime Becky, send for me. I 11 dispose of her ancient adSti4p in a manner she will have ample cause to rememlr*all the rest of, her days. However, let that pass; it-i time you were drssed, and father will be so -out of humor if you are not ready," she graphicallyconcluded, glancing uneasily at her sister, for the sad, strange quiet of the young face pained her. -          . Emily complied; her cold hands moving about here and there in mechanical search of one and another article of dress, which, she put on with the same numbk listless feeling, and at last stood ready-to go down whenever they should summon her. 30      HELEN ETHNGER.               It was the plainest bAidal toilet imaginable-a drab  g alpaca, trimmed with narrow folds of the same, a bit of ' pale rose-colored ribbon knotted at her throat, and those fewwhite rose-buds drooping gracefully in her hair. Yet how sweet and pure she looked. A simple country girl- the daughter of a rough, uncultivated farmer, but a wo- man destined to fight great moral battles, and patiently bear the hard lot the defeated hopes of life assigned her. No one ever knew the secret of her wounded heart; no one ever guessed what a gran heroism lay hidden in' her  young breast; and no one ever dreamed the full extent of  her sacrifice and-her sorrow. It was the first wedding in his family, and Mr. Bassford viewed it in the light of a pleasing holiday, in honor of which he attired himself in his Sunday suit of well-worn tweed, and laboriously es- sayed to be dignified and impressive. Mrs. Bassford also considered it a proudly solemn occasion, worthy of her best gown, and that cherish garment never went over her head with greater pride and solemnity than it did that day. The Misses Baysford--such as were presentable-  likewise donned their pink muslins, and the Misses Bass- ford not presentable were summarily banished to the gar- i ret, there to press their eager faces against the small A windowspanes in anxious effort to catch the earliest glimpse:of Folly and the frigid physique of Luke. Mr.;Lumley, the officiating clergyman, Bergen's revered minister. of the Methodist persuasion, arrived a quarter of an hour: before Mr. Ethinger appeared.: Emily gave a convulsive start when she heard him drive up, and Julia cautiously peeped out of the window, gingerly holding the limp cotton curtain aside just sufficient to accommo- date one inquiring eye, and note for an instant the slow-  alighting of the good old divine. Her heart commenced beating very fast and loud, for the minister was the next   HELEN- ETHNGER.         31'   thing to the bridegroom - precisely as the undertaker is the sequence of thie doctor; and she did pity Emily- so. "It is Mr. Lumley," she said, withdrawing the inquiring eye, and dropping the cotton curtain to turn her attention on her sister, standing whiter than death in the middle of the room, and her eyes dilated like a person menaced by some sudden terror. She sprang to her side in alarm. "Good heavens, Emily, don't look so! You' are pale. as a corpse, and all of a tremble. There, sit down. The room is so close; it is enough to make any one faint," she cried, trying to blame the atmosphere for that which Mr. Lumley's old-fashioned "top-wagon " was obviously responsible for. "I--I thought it was him--Luke," gasped Emily, taking the chair her sister offered, from sheer inability to stand. "Those wheels sound so -so harshy, like the earth falling on a coffin. It seems awful to me, Julia." "For pity sake, don't talk sol" implored Julia. "I confess wagon-wheels do sound ugly to-day, but I pray do not construe it so mournfully. Such thoughts at a mo- ment like this are fearful; and-oh, there they are again, and it is Luke this time. Now be brave, Emily, and kiss me before you go to return here no more by the old name." Julia impetuously threw her arms around her sister, and the tears she could no longer restrain lay like broken pearls on the bride's dark, braided hair. Emily lifted her wide, dry eyes, -a world of sorrow in the gaze, and a hopelessness that was far more touching than the wildest sobs. "I can bear it, perhaps; but I do feel dreadfully. I don't like .him, Julia; I never can. I dread and fear him already, and with such a beginning, where may I hope to find happiness? Every word of the promise to love,   32      HELEN ETHNGER.              honor, and obey will be a direct falsehood, and who is  answerable? Surely God ought not to punish me, for all y the sin; I ought not to be held alone accountable." She spoke in a sadly earnest, anxious tone, and before Julia ? could reply, the voice of Mrs. Bassford was heard in a ! loud whisper from the foot of the stairs, excitedly concise j in the potent exclamation of "They 're here!" which- sub- ! dued concinnity of speech plainly referred to the clergy- r man and her soon to be son-in-law waiting below.     Julia, a little impatiently, tossed back a comprehensive  "We know it!" and Mrs. Bassford returned tothe parlor,  satisfied she had said quite enough to "start the girls."  Without a word, Emily rose, hesitated a moment, as it to a make certain of her strength, and slowly left the low- walled chamber closely followed by Julia, who was in a troubled maze of doubt, excitement, and pity. They en- tered the homely little best-room together, amid a pro- found silence and a general turning of all the assembled Bassford eyes, to say nothing of the minister's pious glance and the expectant bridegroom's formal nod,' Yet it was a very small company for so great an event. Mr. Lum- ! ley, with an eye to effect, had selected the most favorable corner, and was comfortably seated in the best chair, over the back of which he meant to offer the customary prayer at the conclusion of the sacred ceremony, and: wish the !: bride a boundless amount of earthly bliss. The highly interested parents sat gravely enthroned on the chintz lounge, the father attentive and imposing, the mother de- lightfully nervous and anxious, while the presentable Miss Bassford modestly retired to a secluded chair in the farthest corner, -suspiciously braced against the wall, and seldom used on account of a fractured leg, an upholstery infirmity long known and respected by the immediate Bassford family, as the presentable's careful retirement  *s  1I   -HELEN ETHNGER    .      33 indicated,-and sat a wondering nonentity in newly- starched pink muslin and green hair-ribbons. Julia, de- fiant and sympathetic, resolutely remained standing near her sorrowful sister shortly to be a loveless wife, and last, but by no means least, Luke, sitting like a breathing ram- rod in the stiffest chair, the portentous wrinkle unrelaxed, and his shirt-collar, fresh from Becky's skilful manipu- lations, ambitiously trying to eclipse his ears and daringly clamber out of the rigid black silk stock encircling his throat in grim and lustreless folds. Emily mechanically took her place beside him, and during the entire ceremony she did not once lift her eyes from the floor, nor did a sound pass her lips. She did not utter a response, not even incline her head in answer to the solemn promise required of her; but when it was over she sighed audibly, and looked dumbly from one to the other in a pitifully helpless, irresolute manner, and her hand crept up to her heart as if to still the wild pain there. But the ache was for a lifetime, and the weak, tremulous hand above it could not hush its unrestful throbbing. A swift, reproachf .1 glance from the dark, troubled eyes somewhat staggered Mr. Bassford, and his congratulant: "Well, Emily, I'm glad to see you so comfortably settled," was abruptly cut short by her quickly leaving the room; therefore the full extent of the farmer's gladness was never known, or in what the "comfortable settlement" really consisted. Juliaj, meanwhile, had been closely estimating the natu- ral amount of Luke's particular Satan, and unhesitatingly set it down in her own mind as being alarmingly vast and irrepressible, whereupon she went in quest of Emilys and found her crouching on the kitchen door-step, her face bowed to her knees, and sobbing like a child. This -would never do; so Julia lifted her up- and kissed her,  34      HELEN  ETHNGERo and begged her not to cry, and got her own tears mixed with hers in one tender, sisterly heart-flow, and said all the consoling things she could think of, applicable or otherwise. Then she assisted her in getting on her bon- net and shawl, for Mr. Ethinger was to take her away with him-paper-covered trunk and all-that very hour; and she must be composed and civil, and not let on how bad she was feeling, for it would do no good; and she must be reconciled to it, since there was no way of escap- ing what was now fixed and unalterable. Julia was a remarkably determined and sensible Bassford, and Emily had a great respect for her younger sister's firm wisdom, and the free, fearless fashion in which she expressed her sentiments on all occasions. And now, true to the old deferential habit, she grew more composed under Julia's decided but gentle advice, and put on her things quite calm and resigned. Julia, in womanly pity for the poor tear-stained face looking up to her full-of unspoken grief and a Strange despair she could not quite understand, considerately tied over it a thick, blue barege veil; and there stood the hapless bride ready to leave her father's house forever. The little trunk had been brought down the crooked stairs for the last time, and was waiting, like Emily, to be taken away never to return.- Beside her slender ward- robe, it contained Earle's dear picture and letters and sketches, all neatly tied in a package and wrapped in many folds of white tissue paper. But nobody knew of that. It was a shabby little trunk, and did not look as if it held the secret of two broken lives. Emily's eyes followed it wistfully when her father carried it out and briskly deposited it under the seat of Mr. Luke's buggy, wholly unconscious of the contraband love-treasure se- creted in the bottom.   By this time Mr. Lumley was on his way back to the village, having properly finished the business of wedding the two unsuited natures that God never intended should be mated, and said all the appropriate and agreeable things expected of him according to law and usage,- the prayer, and the blessing, and the final good wishes. Luke had stoically unhitched Folly, carefully turned around, and significantly cramped the wheel, a hint for her to hurry through the usually protracted and tearful farewells of bridal leave-taking, and not keep him waiting. A kiss and low murmured good-bye to each, not very seri- ously considered by the simple Bassfords, - for Mr. Eth- inger, in their graphic phraseology, "lived close by, and Emily could run home .often,"-and the next moment Luke was helping his young bride into the buggy., His only adieu being a curt nod, delivered while extricating the lines from the ever-exasperating activity of Folly's long tail. And the ungracious nod was-meant to imply not only a general bow of good afternoon to his new kins- folk, as they fondly thought it to be; but it marked as well the end of all further intercourse or warmer recogni- tion, now, or in the future, of his wife's relations. One sorrowful backward look at the group gathered in the dingy door-way, and beyond them to the old apple-tree. Emily could see it leaning strong and still over the garden wall as when Earle had stood there beside-her and talked of love and fame and happiness; and a great resentful bitterness rose up in her heart against Luke, different from that which she had felt before, and which almost took the name of hate. It was the last object her eyes rested upon in leaving her humble home, and they never left it until dappled Folly carried them over the intervening hill and out of sight. Then she turned her head, the great, silent tears rolling down her cheeks, and O          ,       36      HELEN ETHNGER. ,her hands clasped convulsively beneath her cheap shawl. 'Blessed things are blue barbge veils, and blessed privi- lege it is that brides are permitted to be voiceless and sad! EI ily availed herself of both privileges, and no marble image could have beeW more completely motion- less. She sat mute as a statue, and not a word did Luke utter during the drive of three miles. Past the hand- some gothic residence of Mr. Buel, the wealthy village merchant; past Squire Churchill's fine old family man- sion, with its breezy piazza and smooth green lawn; past the old red school-house at the corners they drove at an easy trot. Then up the little hill beyond at a slow walk, which- brought in view the sloping roof and tall, thin chimney of the Ethinger homestead. Up to this point, Luke had occupied his thoughts by absently switching the daisies and thistles growing along the roadside in reach of his whip, diversified by occa- sionally tapping the flank of Folly, lightly routing the tormenting flies that persisted in thrusting their sharp, poisoned daggers into her sensitive skin, defying all her huge- animal shivers to dislodge them, and no doubt making her very grateful for her grum owner's delicate attentions. But when the top of the hill was gained, and the ancient house but a few rods away, he left off his l random switching of the thistles, and said, laconically, . yet with some degree of satisfaction: "F We are almost home, Emily." "Home!" she echoed, blankly, and was quite still again. It was a long, low, rambling structure, built a hundred years ago, browned by the rain and sun and wind of a century into a weather-stained, decaying gray, with a lichen-grown roof and a dismal gable, that alto-  gether made it a striking illustration of architectural age E and deformity.. There was no porch or blinds, and the   HELEN ETH-NGER.         37 small window-panes and narrow sash had brilliantly re- flected the summer sunshine and endured the winter storms for many generations, just as they were now re- flecting the dazzling rays of the setting sun, flashing and glistening with hues that might rival the changing colors of the prism, and putting gorgeously aflame all the upper western windows. Two great fruitless cherry-trees, dense with foliage, stood on either side of the gate, the wide-spreading branches marred by numberless black excrescences growing out everywhere like monster tumors, and seemed to have long ago outlived the period of fruit and blossom. They shadowed everything from the gate to the door-step, and the deep, quiet shade gave a gloomy aspect to the flowerless front-yard, and threw a sombrous light on the meagre grass. It was a cheerless, uninviting old place, and Emily brought no love withr her to make it the brighter, and no hope to dispel the shadows. Her cheeks, before pale, were now hot and crimson, and in- creased inward anguish had dried up the tears. She felt so sick and miserable - the day was so warm  and the barege veil so suffocating, why need she suffer alone when everybody else appeared at their ease-? She tore off the veil, nearly fainting, and was glad to get a breath of fresh air, and feel the reviving touch of the gentle south wind on her heated and aching brow. Luke drove up under the cher'y-trees and assisted her to alight with very' little effort at gallantry, for which slight the bride was unspeakably grateful, only too glad to be the recipient of his total neglect. She paused at the gate, dreading to open it, a-nd seemed to be waiting for him to hitch and get out the trunk, and while she did so, her eyes went over the scene vaguely and wearily, and no 'thought of Luke was in her mind. The gate was so con- structed that by aid of a  chain and ploughshare 'it ac- 4  38      HELEN ETHNGER. ommodatingly shut itself, and Emily gazed down at the ? heavy, rusty weight, thinking if it had a tongue what a ! mournful tale it could tell. It had clanged behind Jane ! when she passed through it a bride, and it had clanged  behind her whenshe passed through it a corpse. It had opened to give solemn way to the tiny coffins of her little . ones when they left the old wooden cradle for mamma's  more peaceful bed in the church-yard. And now it would j open to her; but when would it shut on her sorrows for- X ever? Emily shivered, and the rusty chain seemed press- -  ing on her very heart. Every object was so lifeless and  melancholy. The well-sweep had something unfriendly  and forbidding about it, the mossy curb and damp stones, i she fancied, were sneering at her, and even the bean- ; poles in the garden stared repellingly, and appeared to question the right of youth and beauty to enter there.  Thee giant sunflowers and flaunting hollyhocks down  among the currant bushes had caught Luke's frown, she A thought, and looked equally unsocial as the rigid well- A sweep and staring bean-poles. Of the four windows- facing the road, two had green paper shades carefully X rolled down, and beneath each window a sickly morning- j glory was trying to crawl up a white cotton string. As  yet it had not reached the low sill, and there was slight i prospect of its ever doing so; but the coaxing twine had' been hopefully latticed from side to side of the casement, and -was evidently the culminating point of Miss Rebecca's : horticultural pride. The cherry-trees were too much for Ai the delicate morning-glories, and they languished for the sunlight, mhuch to Becky's wonder, and a more generous quality of earth, as all that was fair and gentle must i languish, if not die outright, in that heart-killing and soul-stifling atmosphere. Jane perished for lack of home i sunshine and the denial of love; and here was Emily,   HELEN ETHNGER,          39 facing the same peril, coming to encounter the same trials, and meet a worse fate perhaps. The green paper shades shrouded in perpetual dusk the best room, and Emily, from the gate, understood their sacred significance, and the vault-like dampness and gloom that reigned perenni- ally within. To complete the depressing picture, in the doorway stood a gaunt female, apparently posted there to receive and welcome the bride. This ungainly apparition was the awe-inspiring Becky, Luke's maiden sister, and ten years his senior. She was dressed in some unpleasant dark stuff with a fuzzy surface, and an extra long apron reaching nearly to the scrimp hem. Her gown was sur- prisingly short; and, wretched as she was, Emily could not'help noting the comical placement of her feet, encased in prunella buskins of liberal dimensions, and the eb treme. marcidity of two clearly defined ankles encased in y black stockings. The shape and attenuation of Miss Becky's venerable extremities resembled nothing so much as the limbs of a poorly wintered sheep, save the caliper's curve which sat them down on the door-sill like human parentheses in an endless state of punctuation. While Emily was making these furtive observations, Luke had Folly securely hitched, and the trunk safely on the grass; so there was no further excuse for her to linger, and she opened the gate, not, however, without an effort, and went on in advance of her husband, not stopping to see how he managed the trunk, or a compunction of conscience -that it contained the likeness of Earle. The chain and the ploughshare did their duty so faithfully that they came near imprisoning Luke's deliberate right leg, and really made him take one nimble step to avoid an instant collision of no gentle force. Emily, if she knew it, did not heed ,the threatened danger, and kept her eyes steadily fixed on Becky's projecting buskins. Up the   40       HELEN ETHNGER. narrow path to the gray door-stone, across the low, worn. sill, and she had entered the home of her dead prede- cessor. The formidable spinster put out her hand, covered all over by blue, wormy veins, and said, in a shrill, resonant voice meant to be friendly: 4 "Glad to see- you, Em'ly. Come right in, and make yourself at home. - Tea is ready and waitin', so just take off your bunnet, and don't be shy. Set the trunk in the hall, Luke, until after tea, it's so small; it won't be in the way;" end in the emphasized adjective, Emily got her first thrust of Becky's keen andfavorite weapon of sar- casm, delivered in the guise of innocence, and doubly venomous in its purpose. She felt the sting - the covert sneer atIher poverty, and a red spot burned out on either cheek in angry, prideful answer to the ungenerous taunt. But she laid aside her things, as requested; and bestowed a searching, sidelong look on the malicious old maid. Miss Bassford had never entertained any- particular fear of Beckly, although she knew her to be as queer, spiteful, and homely an old piece of useless humanity as ever breathed; but to Mrs. Ethinger, viewed in the light of a virgin sister-in-law' of more than half a century's maturity, she was positively terrific. Whatever her other faults, she had always been a devoted sister to Luke, and affectionately helped him to worry Jane into the grave by every means in her power; and her abilities in that line were of no trifling character. During the first wife's ill- ness, and since her death, she had exercised the undis- puted functions of housekeeper, and was the only being under heaven Luke secretly stood in awe of. The acerbity of her nature equalled his, and in many other ill traits o. disposition she greatly excelled him, and this, added to her age, was doubtless the secret of her influence. She   HELEN ETHNGERO.          41 was sarcastic, collusive, and politic, while Luke was sul- lenly reticent or grumly fault-finding. In appearance she was more unprepossessing, if possible, than her brother,- almost a head taller, and a rail beside her might literally be called stout. She had coarse, iron-gray hair, banded up over her temples in a flaring outward loop and twisted into a fierce little knot at the back of her head, the shorter portions beneath, fringing down on her flabby old neck, quite independent of the fierce little knot, or the restrain- ing comb perched in the centre; and in her supreme moments this subnascent growth vibrated with menacing implacability. There was not a line of beauty in her hard face, and there never had been. Not a trace of genuine feeling or womanly tenderness. Her complexion resem- bled a wrinkled, over-ripe olive ,in hue and texture, and the strabismus affection of her left eye did not add to her benignity of countenance; and what ungracious cat- like, gray-green eyes they were I! There was no baffling that obtrusive squint. It saw everything; and when flung through the magnifying radius of her steel-rimmed spec- tacles, it was awful. Emily's large, dark eyes fell before it, and she made no reply to the insinuating remark lev- elled at her trunk. The active prunellas bustled off to the kitchen, and soon reappeared, bringing back Miss Becky, bearing in one hand the steaming tea-pot, and in the other a plate piled high with smoking biscuits. For this once she was willing to make company of her brother's young wife, and was exceedingly affable and patronizing, comforted by the thought that it was the last time, and Mrs. Emily would find she must wait on herself after to-night. Emily meekly took the place assigned her at the table,  but it was impossible for her to eat. Becky loftily passed ' her a cup of tea and a dish of quince preserves,- the 4    42  .   ' HELEN ETIIINGER. spinster's own choice make, -and Luke hospitably did the same by the biscuits and butter; and though she ac- cepted of eachi she tasted of none, and sat looking at the end of the taBle-cloth in silence. Mr. Ethinger hastily drank a cup"of tea, swallowed thte half of a biscuit, and pushed back from the table, with the brief apology: h, I must stable Folly, and see to the chores before dark. I 'll leave you to Becky's company for awhile;" and with that he went out, and Becky instantly became com- municative. CHAPTER III, BECKY, SPEAKS NO ILL OF THE DEAD. MLY instinctively dodged the oblique vision of her sister-in-law, and made no pretence of caring for the company edibles spread temptingly before her. Becky had a high opinion of her viands, and therefore did not construe the slight into a reflection on her " vittals," but rather the change in Emily's relations. "I can't complain of your not eatin'," said she, extenua- tingly. "Girls never do have much appetite when it comes to this,' energetically fixing the strabismus on her silent listener.' "I've no individual experience, thank heaven; but my sisters, Polly and Rhoda, were just that pi-mnping for a day or two after they were married. No alppetite, no tongue, no nothing; and I suppose it is about the same with all girls. But -you 'll soon get over it, and/ if you a'n't happy, I'm sure it won't be Luke's fault," sweetening her tea with expression, and seeming to wait an answer. None came. Emily was not thinking of   'HELEN; ETHNGBR..        43 Luke and his virtues, and, by way of a compromise for not speaking, she absently buttered a biscuit. Becky saw this with satisfaction, and immediately went off on a new tack. "I'm glad you have some color, any way; for it is something Jane never had," critically scanning the fever-- ish cheeks opposite with marked approval in that awful eye. "I'nm not a person to speak ill of the dead, but whatever Luke could see to marry in Jane Parmlee, is more than I know. The minute I saw her, I knew there was nothing of her. She had no gumption, no manage- ment, and was like a washed-out rag, from the first. -To be sure, she humored Luke; and-it is what everybody must do in this house," with a significant glance at Jane's mute successor, and a momentary suspension of helping herself to a third cup of tea. "But she had n't the mind of a child; and, as to work, it made me sick to see her pud- dling around; out of breath, if she went up-stairs; her back ached if she washed ; her wrists ached if she churned; her head ached if she ironed. Jane always ached some- where. And I wish you could have seen her hands; they were like a baby's; and I just told Luke to keep his doll out of the way, and I'd do the work, for she was only a fuss and a bother; and I think so yet, though I am not one to speak ill of the dead as are beneath the clods, and gone from this world of care," religiously elevating her heavy brows, and a spoonful of quince preserves arrested at her lips while they-gave utterance to this pious ejacu- lation. Plainly, she was reviewing the shortcomings of the first Mrs. E. for the benefit ofthe second Mrs. E., and she kindly hoped the warning might not be lost on her meek listener. But as Emily was still silent, she volubly continued, the dead Jane yet remaining the object under- going minute dissection.   "      HELEN  ETHNGER, "You could not chirk her up: Jane was obstinate that way, and she'd just mope day in and day out, like as if she had n't a friend in the world, and she'd go off by her- self and cry hours at a time for the least thing. I declare it vexed me more 'n a little, for if there is anything that starts my temper, it is to see a woman whimpering around under your feet, and you not to know no more than the dead what ails her. It was a habit with Jane, and I made no bones of telling Luke so. And try to train her and rouse her spirits as I did, too." Becky sighed at the thought of the rank ingratitude of her who was beneath the sod, and Emily ventured a timid question, which greatly pleased Miss Ethinger, because it showed her to be interested at last. "Was he fond of her?" Becky comprehended the pronoun. "Well, yes; I think he was right fond of her at first; bilt he is no hand to make much of anybody. He don't show his feelin' like some folks- it don't belong to the Ethinger nater-and maby that is what Jane missed; she was such a wish-washy creeter herself. Luke is easy to get along with if you humor him, mind that, Em'ly; you must humor him, for he is set in his ways, and won't stand disputin'," with another warning glance which was lost on Emily. - "And did Jane love him t" she faltered, a great pity stirring in her heart for the dead wife whose vacant place she was henceforth to fill. ' Yes, she thought a considerable sight of him on the start, but she took every trifle so to heart, and got so fagged and droopy-like, as I'd no patience with, and I guess Luke had n't either, though Iam not the woman to say harm of her -in the grave. Luke got tired of it after awhile,-you know men do; and so she wilted right down   HELEN ETHNGER.          45 and died almost afore we knew it. Poor thing! I sup- pose she is better off," devoutly lifting her strabismus towards the ceiling. "Aye, indeed, better off," said -Emily, equivocally. "And the children, did he mind their loss so much?" "The boy he did, for he was a promisin' child; but the girl was a puny little thing like her mother. It was n't a year old when Jane was took, and only lived a month after she died. It was wonderful how she did hanker after that child. I remember how she used to tug and lift to get it in her lap, or on the bed beside her, for she was weak like at liftin' long afore we thought her dangerous, and many's the time I've caught her cryin' over it. But it was no use ieprovin' her; and I often did, sharply, too, for it was a sin to be settin' store by the little creeter as was so feeble, and had a blue, half-dead look, as any one could see. I recollect towards the last how she would smother her face down on the pillow beside it, and kinder smile contented-like when I told her, as was my duty, that I thought the child would n't live to grow up, and she ought n't to set her affections on it." "And did you not think it strange of her to smile?" said Emily, softly. "At the time, I did; though I did n't mind her whims much; but now I think she had a sort of warnin' that she was not long for this wicked arth, and it pleased her to know the baby would n't 'be left behind only for a little while. Neither of the children had any constitution-- them Parmlees are all consumptive-and I comforted Luke by tellin' him I thought they were better off with the Lord." "Yes, far better,9ff with the dear Lord and their mother!" replied Emily, in a tone Becky failed to under- stand.   HELEN ETHNGER.  The amiable spinster, having finished her exegetical autopsy of Jaue's glaring faults and weaknesses, sheathed her scalpel, restored to the grave its mutilated tenant, and digressed to a more cheerful theme. "I 'm pleased to see Luke has got a healthy wife this time, and one brought up to work, which was what Jane was n't," .(with a lingering dig at the grave,) " and I'm willin' enough to give up takin' charge. At my time of life- I'm nigh on to fifty-three - one feels like gettin' rid of responsibilities. I a'n't as spry as I used to be; though at your age I did n't know what it was to be tired," (this to remind her that no back-aches or head-aches, in short, no aches whatever, would be tolerated by either her- self or Luke;) "but I am past my prime-now, and often have an all-gone feelin' in my left side, and I'm plagued with such bad nights. I told Luke I nigh about felt my- self a case, and I reckon that 's what sent him so earnest after you." Emily was wicked enough to wish the "all-gone feelin'" might speedily increase, and Miss Becky be laid out quite "a case," so hateful did she seem to her at the moment. Clearly, Luke was not to be duped into marrying a slender, sickly girl again, and had chosen Emily for her rugged health and strength to labor. It was not a pleasant thought, and she pushed back her plate, with its liberal supply of untasted food, somewhat impatiently, and Thastily retired from the table. It was now nearly dark, and she wanted to be alone. Oh, somewhere alonel where that crooked eye was not, and that irascible fringe of iron-gray hair did not vibrate! The longing made her bold, and she said, rather abruptly, if Becky had known'what abruptness was: "If you please, Miss Rebecca, I would like you to show me to my room. I am just a little tired, and, if you don't mind, I 'll take my things and go up now."   "Oh, certainly, just as you like. You 're to home you know, and the trunk a'n't so big but what we can manage it," was her brisk reply, and, before Emily could remon- strate, she had shouldered the trunk and started for the stairs with the step of a grenadier, remarking, in friendly sarcasm: "It a'n't the least bit heavy, a child could carry it; come on!" Emily followed her grim guide up a steep, narrow, un- carpeted staircase, aghast at the little paper-covered trunk being hoisted to such a venerable celcitude by a female who declared herself but a moment ago almost a case, with an all-gone feeling in her left side. Becky lowered her burden on reaching the door, and ushered the bride and her limited baggage into the spare chamber with a manner that said: "There, you are in a decent room once in your life, any way!" It needed no words to tell Emily it was the spare chamber; she inhaled it in the close, damp atmosphere, and saw it in the frigid up- rightness of the pillows. "I suppose you will feel a little home-sickish for a few days," says Becky, relinquishing the offending trunk and resting her open palms on her bony hips, like a general who had fought and conquered. '"But you can run over and see your folks most any time." Now that sounded kind and cheering, but her look was directly the reverse of what she said, and interpreted it would have read thus: "You won't do anything of thq kind, my lady, I can tell you, for you will soon find out' that when Luke Ethinger married you, he did not marry' your family by a good deal. He has got you, and he is, done with the whole Bassford tribe, else I don't knowt' him." She was too prudent at this early juncture, how- -ever, to more than look her thoughts, and resumed, ex- ; pressing a commendable desire to be entertaining.    48      HELEN -ETHNGER. "I'd stay and keep your company, butI 've the table to clear, and the kitchen to pick up, and Luke will soon be in with the milk. You are n't so far from home, I 'm sure, that you need be lonesome till he comes. And if you should care for a light, you'll find candle and matches here on the shelf," pointing to the mantel where stood a long, iron candlestick containing a slim tallow candle, and a bronze elephant from the back of which  protruded half a dozen matches. "I 've made things com- fortable as I know how, and I 'lll go now, for my dish- water is coolin': good-night." And Becky disappeared, leaving Emily to the silence of the spare chamber and the misery of her own thoughts. The sun had set some time ago, and the first thing she did was to roll up the gaudily-flowered- paper shade and- open the window to its widest capacity. A flood of mellow moonlight rushed in, chasing away the dusky shadows, and throwing a soft, calm rift of light across the floor. No need of a candle with such a harvest moon as that hanging full and bright in the heavens! That quaint old room- should she ever forget it? and oh, the long, long dreary years, the many nights of sad- ness and suffering she was to pass there, and the bitter tears it witnessed I Her eyes went from object to object in strange, curious' fear. All were unfamiliar; all were dingy, old-fashioned, and of another generation. The high bed in the dimmest corner had stood there for years, and Luke's mother had woven the blue and white spread that covered it. The dismal hues of the worn and faded rag carpet had echoed the footsteps of many gone over :'the threshold forever, and the skilful hands that wove in warp and woof had long since finished their toil. The six stiff wooden chairs belonged .to a departed era, and rigidly adhered to the wall as if they had grown to ^   ,                     .L   HELEN ETHNGER.          49 be a part of it. The awkward cherry stand, with so much more legs than surface, and the looking-glass hang- ing flat on the white-washed wall above it. A queer little glass, one-third picture and two-thirds mercury, in a curiously carved frame ever so much longer than it was wide, and quite black with age. The third depicted a warlike castle on a hill, with a lake in the foreground, and a mistrustful swan gliding in the centre,-the whole combination of castle, hill, lake, and swan laid on the glass in colors vivid as the gayest rainbow tints and very prodigal in quantity. The remaining two-thirds were entirely given up to quicksilver, and Emily began asking herself where were the forms it had reflected for acentury. Gone, the most of them - gone away to the city of God I The old looking-glass hanging flat on the white-washed wall had mirrored the sad, pale face of Jane in days gone by. This was her bridal-chamber, and her death gra- ciously set her free. Here the tired soul flitted out and went up to the loving Father. Here her babes put on the white robes of the angels and flew away to mother and heaven!  Emily drew back afraid to see her own troubled face in the glass before which so many spirit- faces continually drifted. In the opposite corner hung a cheap print, in a cheap frame, representing a .purple lady, in a yellow skirt and red bodice, sitting, in a gorgeous bower of blue roses, and beneath was the inspiring word, "Contentment," in great capitals, which she construed as a direct satire on her rebellious wretchedness. Above the mantel was a worsted peasant girl,with her apron full of very ripe wheat ears, - probably Ruth of scriptural memory, coming home from gleaning,-flanked on one side by a surprisingly savage little dog, in variously shaded silk; and on the other, by a  much milder cat, also in satin stitch, both of which   50      FHELEN ETHNGER. looked quite natural after you had once discovered which end was the head; for it is very easy to confound the head of needle-work quadrupeds with their tails, which is gen- erally a trifle obscure, and gets mixed up with the rug or cushion, or whatever the interesting animal may be re- posing Upon, in a visionary or artistic sense. Absurd as they were, Emily felt it to be sacrilegious to think lightly of them, for Jane worked them when she was a happy little girl, and her name was neatly embroid. ered in simple gray wool at the edge of the canvas. The fingers that fashioned the silken stitches were meekly joined across her breast, and the eyes that once delighted in the scant garments of the worsted Ruth now beheld the infinite glory of God! .Why should the memory of Luke Ethinger's dead wife haunt her so? Not reproach- fully, but pityingly, as if trying to tell her of the thorny way hero feet must tread,. and how she had died from en- deavoring to live, - died from endeavoring to walk in the hard, wounding path she was but just entering upon. Emily turned from her gloomy survey of the old room, and sat down by the open window, resolved to rid herself of. the depressing phantoms every article of furniture called up, and looked out on the green, cool earth. How peaceful it was--how intensely pleasing the contrast. Every leaf and blade of grass glistened with dew; im- partial nature had not forgotten the smallest bud or meanest leaflet; and her smile and her kiss lay like a germ on all the teeming summer ground. Every plant and flower acknowledged, night's sweet decree of univer- sal rest; and' the uncouth hollyhock had shut her blos- soms from the damp, and the tall heads of the:lordly sunfow ers were bent dejectedly earthward, waiting for the morrow's sunto turn them joyously eastward again. She le aai6  t iut to drink in thl still beauty of the scene,   HELEN  ETHNGER,        61 and then it was she noticed two large apple-trees growing side by side, back of the garden fence. The drooping boughs, ladened with golden fruit, almost touched the ground,- and she gazed at them with tender, longing eyes, little dreaming that those trees, like one she loved at home, were to have their history. Drip, drip, slow and irregu- lar, she could hear the dew falling among the motionless leaves, and see the glossy sheen of -the foliage in the quiet moonlight. "Earle," she whispered, as if making a con- fession to some invisible questioner, "though I am not yours, I love you dearly; oh, so dearly, just as I did be- fore to-day, and, be it right or be it wrong, for love of you the old tree shall have my heart kiss." Standing Ithere in the warm, tranquil light, she threw towards the apple-trees her " heart kiss; " and then she blushed, and, half alarmed, fancied the blazoned knots on the bean- poles, so many malevolent eyes flashing "shame I shame!" so loudly that all the world and Luke might hear. The well-sweep, too, stood there in observing silence, ready to cry "shame!" and the bucket, dangling at the end of what imagination easily converted into a gallows, might be some strangling wretch suspended between heaven and earth for his crimes, and not willing to give up the ghost until he had proclaimed her secret to the winds, and with his last breath shouted out the fearful truth she only knew too well: "Luke Ethinger, you have naught but the shrinking body of the woman you call wife; for Earle Armitage has carried away heart and soul, and you are hateful, ah, miserably hateful to her!"She felt a guilty flush mount to her brow, and cohered her eyes to shut out that terribly accusing bucket bearing so hard on her con- science. Just then, in happy dissemination of her distress- ful thoughts, Becky emerged from the kitchen-door, and sharply whisked a dish-wiper from the gooseberry bush   62      H-ELEN ETHNGER. almost directly under the window where she was sitting, and where it had been bleaching since meridian, only to be brought into requisition and thought of at tea-time, when energetic Becky came to " picking up the kitchen," -a Samsonian feat she performed twice daily with great ease and celerity, according to her own testimony. And a very witch she looked in the moonlight, primly piloting her Sunday prunellas in the middle of the path to keep clear of the dewy grass, and, for the same reason, lifting her gown to an altitude eminently favorable to the dis- play of her black stockings. Becky's anatomy strongly reminded one of the mechanical man in the museum,- all joints and no flesh; and you almost expected to hear her creak-at a sudden movement of hand or foot. That stork-like gait and green-gray eye were overwhelming to Emily, and she made up her mind that, if they did not kill her, it was simply because she had a better constitution than unfortunate Jane. If it was Julia, now, Becky might be forced to capitulate; but Emily had not her sister's invincible courage to demand and maintain her wifely rights; she could only brood over the past and en- dure the present, and from that night she commenced to live two lives,-a real andean ideal one. Luke was the hard master of the first, and Earle filled all the other, the depth and strength of which she was by and by to comprehend in a sweeter and holier affection than any her heart had ever before recognized. The evening tranquillity was so dense and unbroken that Emily caught the contagion of- the pensive stillness, and, without her scarcely being aware of it, the tears were dropping on her folded hands in sympathy with the dew falling outside. She forgot her husband feeding the pigs, she forgot Becky straining the milk, she forgot Jane and the babies buried snug in the ground, and only one face   HELEN   ETHNGER.       63 looked up from her bosom's solitude, only one name found place on her lips, only one, and sad is it that it was sin- -ful of her to love it best. The door opened and Luke entered the room like a man vested with supreme authority over all it contained, and knew what a mental weakling she was--this poor wife of a few hours, the gentle girl he had married because Becky no longer cared to take charge of his house. Emily gave a great start, and sprang up as if to flee, but checked herself, and fell back to her seat in startled dread and fear, too hopeless and miserable to stir or speak. "Why are you sitting in the dark?" he asked, ignoring the bright moonbeams as if the room were in total dark- ness, and marching. to the mantel, amid the broad sheet of silver softly drifting on the floor, he scraped a match and lit the candle as if Emily had been twenty years his wife, and was making a fool of herself in the bargain. He set the iron candlestick on the mantel believing he had created a wonderfully social illumination, and there it flickered like a ghostly eye right under poor Jane's worsted Ruth, and made the savage little satin dog seem more uncertain than ever. Having -accomplished this duty, he came over to her, and, seeing the traces of recent tears, said severely,- for it smacked too much of Jane's besetting weakness to pass unreproved,--"What! crying, Emily. You are very foolish; I can't imagine what you have to cry about - mere childish nonsense.-"And this was her wedding night! Oh, how ugly that deep wrinkle looked between his cold, steely, gray eyes, and how his measured tone smote on her ear! But he could not be altogether harsh to-night beyond this needed first reproof, and put a meant-to-be caressing leand on her smoothly braided dark hair-the soft, shin-   54      HELEN ETHNGER. ing tresses that Earle had kissed and praised and loved. She could not endure'it, and the impulse to scream and rush wildly away from him was so intense, that she shut her lips tight to suppress the cry of anguish threatening to burst from them, perceptibly shrinking and trembling under his touch as if his hand were the coil of a deadly serpent, and her face, blanching to ashes, lifted up its wide, affrighted eyes in a look of strange entreaty that a wiser and kinder man might not have understood. She was mortally afraid of him; and her cowering heart cried bitterly, in its terror and despair, "Oh, Earle, Earle, where are you? Why don't you come to me, and save me from this awful soul-murder? Why did you leave me, why permit me, in my blindness and false view of parental obedience, to commit this irrepa- rable wrong against myself?"Butshe cried to him in vain. Her wisdom had come too late. She was forever out of Earle Armitage's life, and forever in that of Luke Ethinger's. What wonder the pillow grew wet beneath her cheek? Was it strange she softly cried while the moon paled in' the blue summer sky, and the stars faded before the rosy smile of morning? It was desecrating the holy of holies in a woman's breast, so: divinely pure, so sacred to her love, and so beautiful to her thoughts. Well, she was only one of the numberless thousands of women who have- done the same, and carried a face not their hus- band's in their hearts through all the years of their married life!   HELEN ETHNGER.          65 CHAPTER IV. WHAT SHALL WE NAME HER? IF Luke Ethinger had ever possessed a single generous quality of heart or mind, he had lived beyond-it, and was a man thoroughly wedded to selfishness, prejudice, and little tyranny. More than this: he was sordid, incon- sistent, and vengeful, and had one of those cold, slow, vindictive tempers that sets about gratifying itself delib- erately, and when he had succeeded in making everybody around him miserable, he came the nearest to being happy. He was an endless fault-finder, and unappeasable as a Turk. It was impossible to please him; he would n't be pleased; and morning, noon, and night he was the same fretful, scowling despot. It was Luke Ethinger's firm and often expressed belief  that the sole mission of a woman was to wait submis- sively on a man, keep his house in order, and bear chil- dren; and for this common lot of all her sex since the fall of Eve, she was not expected to want or receive much of either affection, kindness, or respect from her husband and master. It was one of the soundest articles of his creed that a  woman never could be  tired. Of course not. What has she to do but potter about the house all day; and there is no real cause for her to looki weary and dragged out when the master comes home for his supper, and if it should not be ready, it is perfectly proper that she should be sternly reprimanded, no matter if it be in the presence of her children, or within hearing of a neighbor. It was sheer negligence, censurable laziness! Suppose it was washing-day, or ironing-day, or any other   '6  -   HELEN ETHNGER. ver-crowded work-day, that had nothing to do with it. upper ought to be ready let what would happen, for he ranted it, and he meant his wishes to be law under his wn roof. This was Luke's oft-reiterated logic, and he steemed it a virtue to be kinder to his horse in the stable lan to his wife in the kitchen. As- was quite natural, restricted to such narrow bounds nd owned by so small a mind, in a year Emily had suc- umbed to circumstances, and quietly sunk to the pitiful avel of Luke's moral standard of excellence in women. ;he was a mere nobody in her husband's house - a cowed, imid drudge, at the mercy of Becky's merciless tongue nd the iron rule of Luke. But she did not die. They ucceeded in crushing her sunny spirits, drove away her are-free smile, and robbed her of her girlhood's-bloom; ut they could not find her heart nor wound her best ffection, for it never came to the Ethinger homestead, Ithough they did cruelly assault her youth and beauty, nd lay waste her happiness with relentless havoc.    j All through the lonely winter she thought only of     uarle as we think of the dearly loved dead. His words nd his look came back to her like the tender blessings re have lost. She listened for his step in the long, cool ummer grass when step and grass were not, and heard is Voice in the silent night-time, gentle and true as she Lad heard it under the apple-tree in more hopeful days. lut step and voice were gone. They only dwelt in her lemory; yet a great love had once been hers, and when ome clouds lowered the darkest, this one pure and beau- iful memory shone the brightest. Spring came with leaf and sunshine, and when Sep- ember had again ripened the grain, and the blossom had iven place to the mellow fruit, heaven bestowed on her a oyal gift, and gave her a love and care and a hope that       HELEN ETHNGER.          57   ' was of the highest, and all her own. After pain and suffering, God sent the angel, and the sweetly-solemn 8 wonder of maternity dawned to Emily Ethinger like unto the star of promise that rose over Bethlehem's babe, pro- -claiming Mary blessed among women. A new joy, a new - comfort--her very life, created beneath her heart and given to her arms at last that it might solace her for the desolation and lovelessness of her wifehood, and, perhaps, lead her to render to the father "A dearness not his due." The bright September afternoon was drawing to a close, and in the chamber where hung the worsted Ruth and the undefinable satin dog, on the high bed with the blue and white spread, very wan and weak, lay Emily with her three days' old baby on her arm. A wee little girl weigh- ing just eight pounds, with large, brown eyes singularly expressive in their solemn quiet and look of inborn patience. Such strange, unfathomable baby eyes, and they opened to the light so fixed and grave that Becky had been forced to exclaim, when first getting her squint to bear direct upon them: "Lord, save us; -what eyes!" and the tone implied they were eyes she did not approve of. In fact, Becky did not approve of the baby at all, and set it down as only another specimen of Emily's foolishness. Luke had been in to'see her once since she had lain there so pale and helpless, and his comfort had been a surly "You'll be about again in a week if you make half an effort," (it was in his creed, you see, to view motherhood as purely natural, and therefore -no reason why she should not soon be up and able to attend to her household affairs as before.) The child he barely glanced. at, and then it was only to find fault because its eyes were   58      HELEN   ETHNGER. so large and-oddly still. He left the rest to Becky, and that dreadful spinster had actually installed herself nurse, and held triumphant possession of the sick-room against all the feeble victim's earnest protests, and was alarmingly wise in the concocting of tasteless gruels, and the many other atrocious auxiliaries presumed to be necessary in the recovery of a young mother. Emily had long ago discovered .that Luke did not marry her family when she reluctantly became his wife, for he had taken the earliest occasion not merely to tell her so, but also to distinctly inform Mr. Bassford that their relations were in nowise to be closer than they were previous to his acquiring the unvalued title of son-in-law. It was natural the old folks should drop in to see their daughter quite often, and the girls should call on their sister when the inclination suited; and it is needless to say Becky kept her brother fully advised of these family visits and their frequency, and Luke's rough "I 'll put a stop to it; I won't have them beggarly Bassfords run- ning here," was speedily put into effect by the broad hint honest Peter shortly after received from Mr. Ethinger, that " in marrying Emily he had not married the whole family." Then it was the farmer took mighty umbrage, and began to deeply pity the one of the family he had married. And thus it came that none of the banished Bassfords had ever seen the little innocent, sleeping like a warm white rose on Emily'slbreast. She looked lovingly down at the little brown head, lightly twisting the scant whisps of soft infant -hair around her pale fingers,-pale from recent suffering, but the hard ridges were yet there and callous marks of toil in the palm, tor, in obedience to Luke's favorite creed, Emily had gone from the wash-tub to her bed; how,fine it was, how rich a chestnut brown.   H:EL EN 1ETHNG ER.        69G Her heart gave a sudden -leap of joy: she recognized her soul-craving in the tiny features of this dainty little mortal, Ah, who did the baby look like? Not like- sullen Luke, not like dark-eyed Emily, but like Earle Armitage; she. was his living image, and the young mother trembled lest other eyes might note the resem- blance. Here was the tangible evidence of her year of brooding and ideal life. The impress of her thoughts was stamped on the lineaments of her child, -the babe of her solitude, her regrets, her patience, her grief and tears,- all reproduced in eight pounds of unconscious humanity. God pity the mother who brings into real existence the shadows and disappointments and sorrows of her broken lifel It was so' with Emily. Her poor, fond, vain dream had betrayed itself in her little sinless daughter. Baptized in her grief before its birth, it is no marvel it came to her with mystery in the brown eyes, and a look of endurance, almost distress, on the infant brow. Emily was alone; and she might fondle the little velvet limbs unrebuked, and take pride in their small perfect- ness without subjecting herself to the contempt of Becky's scornful eye. She might safely kiss the rose-leaf handsi and lay her white cheek on the tender lips; she might watch the come and go of the sweet little breath, and count each little beating pulse, each throb of the little heart, and note the slightest stir of the little form; for it was hers, dearer than the life that gave it life  Her second soul, her womanhood's crown and glory, The sunlight crept away from the window-sill, faded from the wall, and, as the last friendly ray disappeared, a rustle of starched skirts was heard without; the door opened and shut with decision, and Miss Julia Bassford assuringly presented- herself. She came prepared -for war, if need be, but come she would, if Luke had stood at the'   HELEN ETHNGER.              i gate, with his grandfather's old blunderbuss loaded to the muzzle, to deny her entrance, and Becky had met her at the "door, armed with a six-barrel revolver, for a like un- kindly purpose. "Oh, Julia, I am so glad you have come--so very glad 1" cried Emily, trying to lift her feeble head, that she might the quicker meet her sister's eager kiss. Then the glad look faded to sudden alarm. "But what will Luke say, and Becky? Did you see her?" "I don't care what Luke says; and I did not disturb Becky. I came right up, without asking her leave, and don't you fear but I know how to stand my ground," stooping to kiss her and pat her hair encouragingly. Did you think I was going to stay away at such a time as this, for fear of anybody? No, indeed; but we did not know of it until last evening, and then only by waylaying Doctdr Knight "as he was passing. He said you were doing well, and so up, I came to-day, whether or no; and Luke rnay help himself if he can. Still, I do not mean to be anything 'ut peaceable; so you need not be in the least frightened," tossing off her hat and mantle, and going for the baby with true womanly instinct. "Oh, what a little darling:!" she cried, in a gush of feminine raptures, and baby was unceremoniously lifted from mamma's warm bosom to the cuddling arms of the delighted aunt. Few people consider the sleep of infants of any importance, and take them up in the-midst of a delicious nap, as Miss Julia did this one, quite as if their slumber was entitled to no respect from those intent on seeing them wide awake. After getting undisputed pos- session of the little human bundle, Julia sat down in the low rocker beside the bed, and watched it wake up with great earnestness. The brown eyes slowly'opened, look- ing at :nothing in large unconsciousness, and Julia's ex-   HELEN ETHNGER.   clamation of admiring surprise was abruptly cut short by the untimely entrance of Becky, beaing a bowl of beef tea in her hand, which she nearly let fall in her astonish- ment. "What! you here, Miss Julia? Why, when did you come?" "Oh, just now. I stole a march on you, and waited on myself up-stairs. And we thought it very strange you did not let a soul of us know Emily was sick," speaking in a slightly injured tone, yet striving to be civil. "Luke did not think it worth while," lamely apolo- gized Becky. "It's what generally happens when folks is married; and there's no cause to make a fuss as I know on; and if Em'ly has any sort of gumption, she'll soon be up again smart as ever, as I told Luke last night. Jane used to stick to her room the better part of a month at these times; but Em'ly would make two of her," medi- tatively stirring the gruel with a thin, plated spoon, as if it contained the strengthening ingredients for furnishing any amount of gumption. Of all the Bassford girls, Becky disliked this reso- lute Miss Julia the most, and even preferred "Luke's wife"- to her, which fact she took no pains to conceal. It was so provoking to have her looking at her in that calmly defiant way, and always ready with her sharp reply. "A matter of small importance, to be sure," says Julia, testily. "A slight affair to bring into the world a beauti- ful atom like this,--one of God's escaped angels, given to us that we may know what perfect purity is," tenderly kissing the little sea-shell hand crushed up to her lips like a half-blown flower. The language puzzled Becky. It was rather too "high-flown" for her unpoetical concep- tions, and she continued to stir the beef tea in silence, the 6   62 9.     HELEN ETH INGERo strabismus glancing at the purple lady in the yellow skirt and red bodice, but really directed at the uninviting con- tents of the bowl. The hem of her calico dress,--a Mer- rimack blue ground, with white and orange sprigs,- mildly agitated by the up-and-down motion of her right * prunella, swayed in a reflective manner, as if she might be- considering how best to dislodge the now compara-. tively well-intrenched enemy, or was privately speculating upon the misfortunes of life, especially that part of it de- voted to the coming of troublesome babies, and the having the bother' of their pale mothers. What a frightful old woman she was to be in a sick-room, any way! It was positively agonizing to look at her. Nature never put together a more unprepossessing piece of handiwork in all her moulding of homely, disagreeable mortality. The challenging rise and, fall; of that aggressive right foot, the rasping voice, made expressly, it seemed, to sharpen, her words, the ugly loops of grizzled hair, that obliquel: green-graty eye, and the thin, wrinkled lips shutting like a steel trap over three old teeth that were crooked andi decayed and stood anyhow, like the tombstones in al neglected old church-yard. -Ugh! Julia came near ut- tering the contemptuous thought aloud. There was no bodily ill Becky had not experienced, no ache or pain that she, or some near- relation, had not suffered, and she aspired to know the remedy for them all. Her acquaint- ance with the use and infallible efficacy of roots and herbs and salves and liniments and plasters' exceeded the most occult knowledge of established pharmacy, and would have driven a modern drug clerk to despair. And, according to her often avowed belief, Becky's arnica and opodeldoc and assafoetida and beef-gall and wormwood, with the whole intermediate array of her more palatable medicines, had cured multitudes of sprains, chilblains, *   i  -       - HELEN  ETHNGER.        63  and burns; in brief, for everything flesh is heir to, from palsy to croup, she was sure to prescribe a curative, and insist on its being adopted at once, not minding whether the victim be old age or infancy; and the horrid decoc- tions she had strongly recommended, and in several in- stances forced down Emily and the baby, were beyond computing. Julia was well aware of Becky's medical proclivities, and it was to rescue Emily from her doubt- ful kindness that she had braved all opposition, and wgs now sitting at her bedside. Consoled by the reflection that it was almost night, and she would soon go, Becky concluded to be cautiously agreeable, and to that end asked, in a condescending tone: "And what do you think of the baby?"  "Oh, perfectly lovely! - so plump and white and cun- :ning," enthusiastically replied Julia, giving it a hug by way ,of emphasis. "But she is certain to have the redgum,--children of her complexion always do,-and that is sure to bring on sore mouth. If I had mny way, sage tea is what I'd give her to prevent it. Sister Polly always fed it to her'n first thing, and you never see Ihow the little dears liked it. You mark, now, if she a'n't red as a flannel by this time to-morrow," said the old aunt, gazing dubiously at -her brother's offspring, as if it could not compare with those of her sister Polly. "Perhaps not," said the young aunt, hopefully, nestling baby the closer in her arms. "She is sure to," reaffirmed Becky. "There is a pim- ple coming back of her ear now, and redgum makes a child look shockin' for ever so long," smoothing down her apron with one scraggy hand, and, the expressive sway of her foot undiminished, she gave the baby another severe look; and predicted it inclined, to jaundice, for   HELEN ETHNGER.  which saffron tea was promptly urged, precisely as sage tea had been offered in the former case. "So you think her in danger of numerous ills," said Julia. "One little mite to be threatened by redgum, jaundice, and sore mouth all at once, heralded by a posi- tive pimple, is quite serious, Miss Becky." "Serious or not, it's true," replied she, like one blessed with foreknowledge of all this little life was to encounter in its perilous earth journey. At that moment baby drop- ped off to sleep again, unconscious of the scrutiny she was undergoing, or the ills in store, and Becky found a new theme of dissatisfaction. %. "She don't seem to me exactly right, - sort of fitty, and acts queer at times, mostly when it's sleepin'. I never saw one draw up the corner of its mouth and trem- ble it like, that wa'n't fitty naterly, and you may depend, a child as twitches its eyelids, and kind o' half lifts 'em when it's asleep, as this one does, has spazzums about it. Jane's baby always did, and it died in a fit-teethin' -spazzums they called 'em." "Good gracious! you don't mean to say that this poor baby is teething, too, with all the rest!" cried Julia, in assumed consternation. "Oh, laws, no!" - Becky was quite in earnest; -" but you see how she quivers her eyelids; that's a sure sign of fits, as anybody can tell you as has decent sense." Becky wished to insinuate by her mysterious "not ex- actly right," that the child's intellect was a trifle defi- cient, and a "spazzum" would entirely overthrow it. "Oh, dear, you unfortunate baby; how your afflic- tions do multiply! If all this comes upon you in three days, what will not'a year bring?" laughed Julia, and an impulsive repetition of the smuggling kiss brought the little innocent wide awake again.    "I suppose you have not decided upon a name yet?" she said, turning to her sister, and thinking the baby might need one, despite Becky's predictions. "Not altogether," hesitated Emily. "I thought of calling her Helen, if--there was no objection," a blush crept up to her pallid cheek and ran away in a faint pink tide, going unobserved as quickly as it came. Helen was the name of Earle's only sister, who died young and of whom he had been very fond. "Then Helen let it be," said Julia, decisively. "It is a grand old Roman name, and just suits the expression of her deep, soulful eyes. So Helen it is and shall be, for in this instance, Emily, your wish must be held as law, and no objections are likely to be made, I am sure," glancing furtively at the spinster, as if she doubted her own assertion. "Humph! It's a trumpry name to my mind," stiffly disapproved -Becky. "I'd flattered myself you might call her Rebecca Jane, after me and Luke's first wife, as kind-tempered a creeter as ever lived." She was in the habit of praising Jane, when it served her turn, with as much unction as she was wont to blame her, and the present she felt to be a proper moment to speak of her de- parted worth. Emily looked up in dismay, and Julia laughed out- right. "Rebecca Jane, for a sweet baby like this darling? Mercy! better kill the child at once. It is worse than the spasms and the jaundice." The laugh nettled Becky exceedingly. "I presume I am as near to it in blood as any of its aunts, and am as much entitled to a hearin' as the best of 'em, though I am not allowed to offer a name." "Oh, certailily," good - naturedly acquiesced Julia,  S  i      HELENI ETHNGERo  "you are entitled to a hearing, but not to the extent of Rebecca Jane. The baby's name is Helen; no diminutive ]Nellie nor rollicking Nell, but noble, fair-sounding Helen." Becky was confounded at- the unexpected firmness of the young aunt, and Er ily felt as if she had conquered once in her life. Julia, however, was usdd to victory, and was modest and magnanimous in her triumph. Becky had tried her utmost to slyly wound both the sisters, and with the same weapon. It was for that she artfully alluded to Luke's first wife, and the " spazzums," and the not being "exactly right." They were all cruel flings at tender marks, but all fell short of their aimn; whereupon she bridled to a renewal of the attack and tartly essayed another thrust. "Call her what you please, I'm free fo say there's not an atom of the Ethinger look about her. She re- sembles neither her father nor mother, as I can see, and I am as good at seein' a resemblance as anybody. Em'ly's eyes are a'most black,'and Luke's a gray like mine,"- Julia glanced at the green squint questioningly, - "and this child's is a dead brick color." ",But there is a great difference in the color of bricks, and some are very pretty. At all events, she shall not be condemned to the barbarous infliction of Becky Jane, while I have a voice in the matter." Becky scorned to reply, and caught up the bowl of cold beef tea in suppressed displeasure. "I 'll go down to the kitchen and warm it over; it's cold as a stone, and I 'll be up afore you go." - "Don't hurry yourself," blandly rejoined Julia. "I've come to stay a week." "A week!"  Becky was aghast. The house invaded for seven days by Julia Bassford? it was outrageous!  i       HELEN ETHNGER*.         67 "Yes, a whole delightful week. I'm going to stay till Emily gets back her gumption; and I'd never dare to leave this dear babe menaced, as you say she is, by a whole catalogue of infantile diseases. It would be inhuman of me. To be plain, Becky, I have come to take care 6f my sister while she is sick, and I am going to do it let who will object. She may be your brother's wife,but she is also my sister, and here I stay until she's well. I'll be responsible for her gruel, and the baby's jaundice, and everything else that may occur." Julia threw a defiant smile in the direction of the bowl, and out flounced Becky in high indignation, muttering, as she descended the stairs, "The impudent, isassy baggage! I'll see Luke about it." What she said to Luke is not known; but however strong she related her grievances to him, he took no ac- tion in the matter, for he secretly stood in just a little wholesome awe of Miss Julia, and was shy of giving her direct battle apart from his general contempt of her family. It was Julia's strategy to always beard the lion in his den, and when she heard Luke's step in the passage, a moment after Becky's uncivil departure, she sprang up, thre'w open the door, and smilingly faced him with the baby in her arms. "I am sure, Luke, I congratulate you on having such a dear little daughter." This was feminine generalship of a superior order, and it staggered Luke immensely. You would have thought her the most welcome of sisters-in-law, and that she held him in excellent respect. "You may well be proud of her, for she is just like a pearl-a ray of heaven's own light;-and we have named her Helen. Don't you think it a sweet name?"       ,    8      HELEN ETHNGER. . "I 've no choice," said he, indifferently. "Helen is as good as anything, I suppose," tramping away with never a look at the lovely pearl, whose pure light was to shine so long unnoticed by him. Julia shrugged her shoulders, and thought what a dreadful fate it must be to be obliged to listen to that dry voice and measured step all the days of one's -life,--a man whom nothing could warm into a gentle endearment, in whom no beauty, or innocence, or helplessness could arouse a human glow of feeling. She came back to, Emily more than ever disgusted and out of patience with cold, unapproachable Luke. '"I made him agree to the name, and I made Becky strike her colors and raise the siege, and there is consola- tion in that at any rate; so don't you worry; and you may be sick a month if you want to," she laughed, and added, after a pause: "Of a truth, baby don't look a bit like either of her parents. Becky is right there: I can't see the least resemblance." "Pray, who does she look like, then? If no Ethinger, she is certainly no Bassford," said Emily, affecting a light manner, "Well, I don't know.' It is hard to tell when a baby is so young; but, somehow, her eyes remind me of Earle Armitage,-you remember Earle,- only-they are sad and still, unlike his, the color, I mean. You may recol- lect Earle had splendid brown eyes." Emily did recollect. "Yes, they were large and brown, and not sad-soft, kind eyes as she remembered them." Her hand was ab- sently mootoing the edge of the blue and white spread, and the pale lids drooping over the downcast eyes told not of their sadness. Julia continued in a musing tone, little dreaming of how her words were sinking into her sister's heart     HELEN ETHNGER.          69 "I wonder what has become of Earle? seeking his for- tune, I presume; and the spell seized him all of a sud- den. Strange, that this little winsome Helen should bring him so vividly to mind. But I have hot time to be sentimental; I 'll go and superintend the making of a fresh bowl of beef tea, and see that Miss Becky does not put too much water into it, for you are to have no more slops from this moment." She gave the child back to its mother, and noiselessly tripped from the room. Emily was alone again with her babe,- her light, her pearl, her blessing; and other eyes besides her own had recognized in her darling a resemblance to Earle Ar- mitage. CHAPTER V. NOT EXACTLY RIGHT, TEN years passed away, and Emily at thirty was greatly changed from the blooming Emily of nine- teen. Other children came to her, but none were like Helen, and none were so dearly loved. The mother cher- ished a peculiar affection for this daughter, because she was so much a part of her deep, undefinable inner being. Sorrowful memories clustered thick about her, and the sweet sanctity of those old hopes and long-since vanished dreams hung around her like a mantle. From earliest infancy little Helen had been called odd, queer, and strange by almost everybody, and- by Aunt Becky, " not exactly right." That pernicious old woman could not be made to relinquish the idea that something was painfully amiss with the child's intellect, and per-   70'      HELEN ETHNGEBR  sisted in the ambiguous declaration that she "did not know what to think of the girl: she had n't the sense a child of her age ought to have; she was wrong somehow; and, to her mind, not exactly right;" the last rendered the more conclusive by a suggestive tapping of her wrin- kled forehead, and a drastic flirt of her nose in the air. Helen heard these whispers with strange unrest. They drifted uncertainly to her from playmate, teacher, and aunt. What was she?--an idiot like poor Mattie Jones, or a half-witted creature like Jimny Dodd?- People called those poor unfortunate beings odd and queer, just as they did her. And Helen Ethinger was not the first child who has thus brooded over the thoughtlessness and igno- rance of persons who fancied themselves exceedingly per- spicacious. By her father, she was less loved than any of his children ; that is, if he could be said to really love any of them. He did not ill-treat her in the sense he did the younger ones,-for Luke was a stern, rough, and, not un- frequently, cruel parent - but her dread and avoidance of him were quite as great. He never lifted his hand against -her, merely because she never put herself in his way; and so it came Luke learned to completely overlook her, and take no tender notice of her whatever. She was in his house; but beyond that, and;,now and then a cold com- mand or harsh rebuke, she might never have existed, for all the interest he took ini her welfare. Whole days and weeks, and even months, passed without his speaking a word to her; and she was equally silent. Fhar and marked avoidance of her father were the first traits de- vetoped in Helen's singular character, and in her very cradle she instinctively recoiled from him, and every day the feeling grew upon her, until to shun him became the principal aim of her life. She could not help it. The feeling was born with her, and if he unexpectedly entered r  .  .   HELEN ETHNGER.          71 the room, she slipped out the nearest door unobserved. If she saw him in the yard, she quietly glided away. If she -happened on him by chance anywhere, it was in her nature-and the impulse she always acted upon-to softly retire. She never made a request, never asked a question, never offered a remark, and never expressed opposition. If told to do anything, she obeyed without replying. If asked -a direct question, she answered. it by a decided yes or no. It was sure to be one or the other, without the usual childish circumlocution of doubt, excuse, or supposition. Her words were few, her smile rare, her voice remarkably low and sweet, and her step light and noiseless as the flut-- ter of a falling leaf. She was always so quiet; her being seemed to be in a continual hush of thought, subdued by that strange inborn fear and peculiar reserve so much a' part of her nature. She was fond of being alone, and would creep off by herself, not to play,--she did not care for that any more than she did for the society of her school companions,--but to think, and would sit for hours in her favorite nooks, lost apparently in the most abstracted thoughts. Whether crouching knee-deep in the fragrant- red clover along the orchard fence, or half buried in wild" verdure and bloom under the plum-trees at the foot of the garden, or standing among the rank sedge and water- reeds at the edge of the brook, that so merrily purled its musical way through the daisy-gemmed meadow, watching with listlessly-folded hands and rapt, inquiring eyes, the sparkling eddies form and break and die in laughing little circlets kissed by the golden reflection of the overhanging cowslips, and the eager lap of-the tiny wavelets on the sunny green banks, that look of serious reflection never left her. In all places, and under all circumstances, she was the same strange, incomprehensible child. And such a gravely   72      HELEN   ETHNGER. earnest little face was Helen's, with its look of unspoken wonder and reaching life, its silence and strength and purity; and a handsome little face' also, if it had not been so strikingly pensive, and the habitual expression so far beyond its years. Her straight,i short hair, brown as the wing of a mountain thrush, was :smooth and lustrous as softest satin, a full, broad brow iof almost mournful se- renity, and large, gentle eyes opening from the long, silky brown lashes, in all the soleWanmystery of undefined genius. If praised, she looked up with those still, deep, unreadable eyes, and a shade of sudden pleasure rippled across the sweet, mute lips that seldom spoke her heart's few delights. If blamed, the ,gentle eyes went down quickly,-veiling whatever they portrayed of wounded feel- 'ing; and that was the only difference visibly produced by -the two. extremes. The ennobling characteristics of Helen Ethinger's na- ture were patience and a grand forgiveness. She largely possessed the power to endure,- the spirit of self-sacrifice to suffer much for the sake of another's peace and it came to her like a second self. Though not a brilliant scholar, she was assuredly a thorough one, and what- she once mastered she retained; ;yet her schoolmates called her stupid, her teacher pronounced her dull, her father believed her to be a perfect dunce, and Aunt Becky reli- giouslyheld to thesame opinion, iut softened the epithet by-the old, hateful assertion that she was not "exactly right." Helen's strong attachment for her mother amounted'almost to idolatry; it was the one passion of her- quiet?-soul, the one worship' paramount to every othler, To her little brother and sisters she was ever the kind, helpting mediator, and bore with their tempers, soothed their tears, and sympathized with their juvenile troubles--and temper and tears and troubles were by no' \   HELEN ETHNGER.          73 means rare with the young Ethingers, nor always to be readily appeased. Alfred was a high-spirited little fellow, a year and a half Helen's junior, and his besetting sin was a quick;   violent temper, which, from babyhood, had been at war with that of his grim, hard father, whom he regarded as his natural foe, and held in his boyish heart accordingly. To speak truly,-and it is a dreadful thing to say,--he hated his father, and was respectfully afraid of shim; his obe- dience was no deeper than his parent's physical ability to punish him, and, as for filial affection and duty, the lad It  did not know the meaning of the words. How could he 1;e when no fatherly love or kindness had ever called them into life? When he could, he deceived, disobeyed, and avoided his father as a matter of course, holding neither a sin, "but just getting the best of him." He  was a wonderfully active child, and more than commonly intelligent, and withal he had a boy's quick shrewdness, and took advantage of his father's weak points with zealous promptness; studied his habits, with a view to profit by them; watched all his movements, in order to safely plan his o n; had his mischief, fun, and usual amount of boy deviltry quite to the bent of his desires, and, if caught at it, bravely took his scolding or his thrashing, and the first opportunity that presented itself, did pre cisely the same  thing over again. Luke laid a rathless prohibition on every pleasure dear to childhood, and for- bade the things dearest to the hearts of his children; that was his unvarying system of youthfiil discipline. Never let a  child -do as it wants to; never let it have a toy or/a holiday it mayparticularly desire; always ake themi do what is avowedly repulsive to their feelings; never ac- credit them with an opinion-nor a glimm er of common-se;, take no notice of their  wishes, and deprive them ofevdevy 7i's^              ^.   HELEN ETHNGER.                 joy and amusement within your power to control. This was Luke's moral discipline rigorously exercised in great and small childish peccadillos, especially towards his son, and, as a certaii consequence, he was fast making of the clever, handsome, generous lad a systematic liar, and an accomplished dealer in premeditated deceit, and what the neighbors already began to term a "bad boy." Becky reaching-the climax of his future woeful end, by the broad statement' that' "he was cut out for a bad one, anfd it all  came from the vicious Bassford blood."  Hattie, a pretty little girl of seven, as /careless and impulsive as Helen was shy and serious, was the next eldest, and her brother's faithful confidant and ally. She it was who devotedly  helped him in his duplicity, connived at his earnest efforts to baffle the paternal eye, told great fibs for him, could only see and hear in his defence, grew tongueless and con- tumacious in exact ratio as the barometer of Alfred's sins went up, and the warning glance of his twinkling black eyes indicated her to be silent and non-committal. She enthusiastically shared his scrapes and their subsequent punishment, defended him, quarrelled for him, and loved him like a dear little sinful innocent, proud in the belief that in lying for Alf she was' doing something really noble and sublimely generous.  It cannot be denied that Alfred and Hattie had a deep- seated dislike for their father; yet, strange as it may seem, they were his favorites. At least, he had. taken the most notice of them as babies, and once Emily remembered seeing him kiss the boy while he lay asleep, and he thought no one was near; -but to a man of Mr. Eth- inger's irritable temperament, it was a' favoritism not ap- preciated by its objects, for his notice was fraught with so much roughness, so many extemporaneous cuffs and scowls and commands, so many off-hand k'ocks and undeserved   HELEN   ETHINGER.                75 whippings, administered when least expected, and for reasons they did not clearly understand, that it failed to touch the right chord in their resentful breasts, and they did not hunger after his stern affection. They got along very well without it, for Alfred and Hattie were each blessed with a comfortably tough conscience, thanks to Mr. Ethinger's admirable discipline, and held their father very cheaply there. Condemn not the fruit until ye know by whom the tree was planted; judge no wicked, wayward heart until ye know-what adverse and destroying influence marred its better growth ! May,-the third daughter of this discordant household, was four, a sweet little fair-haired creature, who had already learned to hide at Alfred's warning cry of "father's coming!" and his advancing step was the signal her little toddling feet obeyed by hastily "dropping- out," as Alfred called it, with the rest. And sad is i that a father's step should scatter them the same as if a snake had suddenly writhed up in their path, and send them all to cover like a flock of startled young partridges. Oh, Luke Ethinger, when your son and daughters are no longer children, where will be your place in their hearts I What right have you now or ever to their filial love, duty, and confidence? None. You have outraged and crushed all that was naturally tender and dutiful towards you, and if. the weapon comes home to your own breast at last; who can say it will not be just? As ye sow, so shalt ye reap ! Anabel, the baby, was only a month old, and Becky had not yet forgiven Emily the fact of her undesired ex- istence. This fifth evidence of Mrs. Ethinger's obstinate foolishness quite overpowered Miss Rebecca for the time being, and the wrathful maiden shut herself up in her room to meditate whether number five might not have been  76      'HELEN ETHNGER. prudently dispensed with altogether; but the gloomy prob- lem was beyond her virgin ability to solve, and she- was forced to dismiss the subject and reappear from her vol- untary imprisonment with the single small grain of con- solation "Thank heaveni it ta'n't a boy!" As for Luke, he made it a rule never to interfere with the management, of infants until after they were weaned. His discipline commenced at about that dismal period in a- little wean- ling's life when it wakes up in the middle of the night, missing the nestling cheer of the mother's bosom, and plaintively cries for a drink, babbling some imperfect name for water, mingled with a piteous call of "mamma, mamma, mamma," as all of us have heard and perhaps responded to a hundred times. And how quickly that little wailing midnight cry will bring the mother to it. She will hear though slumber chains other ears; and you may be pretty sure the baby will not leave her arms again that night, let the weaning process be as it may. It is likely to remain in statu quo until morning, at all events. Qow Luke's method, in a case of this kind, was' to bestow, instead of the desired water, a smart spanking in spite of all Emily could do to prevent it. The four eldest, much to Becky's regret, had outlived this trying era in their young lives; and tiny Anabel was yet some months from the dread ordeal she was to undergo before she was subject, like the rest, to her father's dubi- ous authority. They were all healthy, handsome children, apparently, of far better promise mentally than Helen, and very little in their nature that assimilated with hers. They were too full of wild pranks and boisterous mirth to suit her quiet mind, and their noisy sports jarred unpleasantly on her love of solitude and thought. Alone, she could think of many beautiful things, and then it was a new longing   I          HELEN ETHNGE'R.         " wish, -a reaching forth after the brain visions that had so evaded Earle. The summer sky, the meadow brook, the waving grain, and tender grass, the humble wayside. flower, the gleeful song of the birds, all spoke to her a language she could understand, for in the child-mind were garnered a wealth of beautiful thoughts, and a poet  soul looked out from the pensive eyes. Helen Ethinger was a genius, and the unobserving called her queer, com- mon dullards termed her stupid, and her affectionate aunt Becky "not exactly right;" verily, what a wise world it is! One day Helen sat under the plum-trees, smuggled down in the grass in her usual musing attitude, her sun-bonnet on the ground beside her, and .her lap full of bits of white paper covered all over by careful pencil marks, -rude lines and angles that yet had curves of taste and harmony. And this was little Helen's first crude attempt at draw- ing,- the artist, the poet, and the child all blinded to- gether, and struggling for definite shape in her mind. "I can't do it," she sighed. "I wish I knew what all the strangely beautiful things I feel are, and where they come from. I can't see them only in my thoughts, and they plague me so. It must be that which makes me stupid. I am not like anybody else. I wonder why it is, and where my thoughts do come from." She settled lower in the grass, and the asking eyes looked up to the shimmering leaves as if they might answer.- The whiteo umbellar blossoms of the elders skirting the old wall were I   not more silent than she, and the birds paused with up- lifted wings above the small still figure, and hished their song and stayed their flight to peep askant through the foliage at the lonely little girl beneath. A tangled net- work of vines and wild vegetation shut her in on all i: -  *     ' -.-;*J   78      HELEN ETHNGER. sides, such as always adheres to the isolated wall of an old garden,-dwarfed, unkept fruit-trees, blackberry bushes, and monster weeds; but there was one who knew of this dim retreat, and had often seen little Helen dis- appear within the matted labyrinth, with fondly yearning eyes. While she lay in the cool, rank grass oblivious of all around, a noiseless hand parted the intervening leaves and a light foot-step came upon her unawares. "I thought I would find you here; and I came to see if my little girl had not forgotten that it was almost tea- time," said her mother, gently breaking in on her dreams. Helen sprang up in startled confusion. "I did forget, mother, and I might have known it was late by the sun. going over the wall." In her haste to gain her feet, the scraps of white paper fell unheeded to the, ground, and Emily picked them up with no small curiosity. "What is this, dear?" '( Oh, some thoughts I had. I don't mind telling you, for you will not laugh nor think me odd, as the others do. I saw some prints in the window of Mr. Alfair's book- store at the village last week; he let me look at them most an hour,--one was like a farm-house, and I tried to draw something like it, but I could n't," glancing at the bits of discarded paper despairingly. Emily softly stroked the brown head, and the old, old memories came back swift and strong. Had she the soul- inheritance of Earle Armitage's talent as well as his eyes?  "Would you like to learn drawing, Helen?" "Oh, mother, if I could; if -I could." The child's whole heart went out- in the wish, and Emily formed a vague plan whereby it might be gratified.   HELEN ETHNGER.          79 A daring purpose entered her mind. She would make one prayerful appeal to Luke,-beg him, on her knees, to listen to her and yield to her wishes once. She would overcome her fear and reserve, and for the child's sake implore him to permit Helen to study drawing. That was the mighty task she set herself there under the scraggy plum-tree, and in behalf of her darling she be- came brave and determined. Helen interrupted her train of hopeful thoughts by asking, somewhat abruptly: "What is being a strange little girl, mamma? The teacher said yesterday I was a strange little girl, and all the scholars laughed." ".No matter who laughed, my daughter, or what the teacher said to make your playmates do so. You are only strange in having a mind higher and better and purer than most little girls; and they don't understand you." "Is that it, mother? Oh, I am so glad. I feared I might be foolish,-a miserable idiot like poor little Mattie Jones,"- replied Helen, in a tone of sudden joy. "Foolish, like Mattie Jones! Oh, my child, you are too wise, and living too much beyond your youth. They call you odd because you are not fond of play, and like your own company best," said Emily, the tears crowding to her eyes in spite of herself. "Then I will never let it worry me again," said He-en, in simple satisfaction. "Did it worry you, dear?" "Yes, sometimes. But if you think I am not queer, I 'll fiever let it trouble me any more," lifting her eyes in frank, childish simplicity. "I know you are neither queer nor strange in the way some people mean, and I hope you will never again suffer 'their silly remarks to give you a moment's disquiet.- I   80-    -HELEN ETHINGER. feel you to be not stupid; far from that; nor what Aunt  Becky would have you, but richly gifted, gifted in- all that is good and noble; Helen, and by and by you will discover your talent. And above all you are precious and dear to me, my darling, past my poor words to tejl," cried Emily, in a burst of passionate love. "Dear, dear mother, you love me, you find my heart," sobbed Helen, folded close in her mother's clasping arms. "I don't care who says I am queer, if you knoutw it is not true."  v  She had implicit confidence in her mother's word, and nothing could shake her belief in herself after this. She never forgot that conversation, and from that hour affec- tion for her mother became the guiding star of her life; her sole hope and faith and ambition had its end and be- ginning in the silent prayer," for mother's sake." To be. always searching without ever finding; to be always reaching and never attaining, is sad enough; but to go through the world misunderstood is much worse, and, save for her mother, Helen was doing both. The uncongenial atmosphere of her home, the sternness of her father, the slights of Aunt Becky, all had their effect, and served to shut up the well-spring of trustful confidence in her breast, and live a solitary life within herself, as it were. It was this that made.' her observant, but silent, self-denying, and self-reliant, and when the child-hands were very small they began to be useful without urging, and helpful without asking.  It was wonderful to see how readily she came to her mother's aid, and voluntarily assumed household duties and set herself heavy tasks while -yet a mere child. Quiet as ashadow, she would flit about here and there, washing dishes, clearing the table, sweeping and dusting, and getting the younger children ready for school, and all with the care and steadi-   ' . HELEN ETHNGERo        81 ness of a woman; patiently bearing the brunt of l- fred's boy rages, Hattie's heedlessness, and Mary's whim- pering fretfulness. But her father never gave her a kinder look, and no "Thank -you, Helen," ever greeted her in i t   return for the willing service she rendered him. The"    young heart ached for her mother, and aught that light- ened her burden, or mitigated her cares, though ever so little, was reward enough. Helen was not slow to see the ravages thankless toil and continual fault-finding were making with her mother's youth, and what was left of her once healthful beauty. Work,-work, all day long and half the night, repaid by gruff words and sullen frowns, was Emily's unhappy lot; and so the seasons came and went, and babies and household cares increased year by year, -until five children gathered in the old Ethinger homestead, and Helen unconsciously glided into the shadow with her mother. It was a bright Monday morning in June, -and the three started for school, - Alfred and Hattie, always in- separable companions, running on ahead to overtake a shouting group of boys and girls some distance in ad- vance, and Helen slowly walking on alone. Nobody stopped for her; none of them said, "Good-morning,"-for she did not stop for any one, or hasten to meet them, and was quite as chary of her social "good-morning" as they. She did not notice, and therefore was unnoticed herself. Frank Buel, swinging his dinner-pail like a war-club, led the van, with Hattie close at his heels, and Alfred, with half a dozen more in full tilt, spurring after at a' breathless pace. - Hats and bonnets bobbed over the little hill and went out of sight on the other side, leaving Helen to plod on alone in her dreamy, silent fashion.  Helen never scampered like that. It would be amazing   82      MHELEN ETHNGER. to see her jump; and run, and hear her shout and laugh, in their gay, uproarious manner; and her school-fellows would as soon have expected to see her fly. Just as the last bobbing head disappeared behind the hill, a boy sprang over the rail fence, agile as a young elk, his feet brushing the misty cobwebs from the grass, and ruthlessly crushing the poor little white: clovers that were trying to lift their dewy petals to the sun, and his ruddy, hand- some face aglow with haste and health. "Halloo, little quiet! All gone but you?" was his lively salutation. "I am always last, Asa," she said, tranquil in tone as the calm June morning. "A sure sign that you will come in first." He modulated his pace to her slow walk, and they went on together in silence. A momient ago in such a seeming hurry, he was now content to ,be dilatory, and waited on her lingering footsteps with evident satisfaction, his coun- tenance expressing a boy's shy partiality for her society, and her eyes frankly owning, in the quick, glad look she gave him, thatit was pleasant to have him near her. ; Asa Churchill was the only son of the village lawyer, and about as intellectual, independent, and good-natured a specimen of rural worth as it is possible to find. He was sixteen, and had a peculiar liking for quiet little Helen Ethinger. He never called her queer or stupid, for he knew she was far from bhng either, and was ever ready to help her out in a difficult lesson, and gladly gave her ,the. benefit of his older years and superior wisdom. Asa was esteemed apt, smart, and talented by the more intel- ligent of the villagers, and was. a general favorite with everybody. This was his last year at the district school; he would go to the Bergen academy next summer, and then to college, 'Helen had a vast respect for him already,   HELEN ETHNGERB.         83 and would raise her solemn eyes, wistful and grave, to his beaming face, and listen to his lucid explanations in atten- tive silence. The prospective academy and college filled her with veneration; and in her simple heart she vested him with great learning in the fature, and now looked upon him as being a prodigy of boy-gooduess and saga- city, and a model of all that was noble and deserving of her girlish admiration. * CHAPTER VI. X1D     A DOMESTIC BEDLAM. Emily was a cowed and trembling wife, she was also a domineered-over and timid mother. She was the uncomplaining slave of her children, and, with the ex- ception of Helen, they feared her chastisement and heeded her counsel the least of anybody in the universe. Hattie adjudged Alfred's advice as being of vastly more import. ance than that of her mother, and his smallest wish reacily obeyed in preference to the most urgent maternal command; and Alfred was very much of the same opinion. May quite ruled her mother already, and fought and cried her way straight to what she wanted, unintimidated by the mother's mild reproof, until pacified by what were oft- times weakly, indulgent coaxing and morally hurtful promises made for the sake of peace, with hardly a thought of the unwise promises ever being fulfilled, or the coaxing to remain potent-beyond the moment. But they were all too young to realize the true extent of their naughty, uncurbed self-will, or comprehend what a wild,   84      HELEN ETHNGER. saucy, ungovernable young trio they were. Emily ha always waited on, humored, and given undue sway to them from their earliest infancy; and they were per petually bearing her scolded, found fault with, orderec about, and growled at by their father; and so, from mere force of habit, they naturally considered her authority oj small value, and tendered her slight respect, althougl they dearly loved her after a careless, harum-scarun fashion, and in their childish hearts she was held entirely a mother, notwithstanding their being such headstrong little torments. Lordly Master Alf asserted his wants ii a positive and determined manner; heedless Hattie pushec her claims with like magisterial fervor; and imperious Mis, May seemed to believe herself of the utmost importance enforcing her desires by stress of lungs and stamp of foot and clench of hands, as excessively indulged four-year-old young ladies will at very trifling provocation. Aunt Becky declared a hundred times a day that they worried the life and soul of her out; they had no proper bringing up; worse young ones never lived, and made many sug. gestive movements towards her convenient buskin-ties with- stern intent of inflicting severe personal chastise- ment of the good old-fashioned sort; and sometimes she accomplished her purpose with more skill and vigor than was at all pleasant to the loudly remonstrating recipients of her strong-handed attentions. :But as they increased in stature and wildness, experience taught them to be nim- ble and watchful, and they evaded Aunt Becky and'her terrible buskin with remarkable agility and ease. Aunt Becky was getting on in years, and, as she said, "about gin' up work." The strabismus had also nearly given out; so, the poor old creature was-partially blind, and wore hideous green goggles to protect what little she had of remaining -sight, and was the object of Alfred's   Jif I         HELEN ETHNGER.          85 interminable tricks and jeers and mischief, aided by that naughty midge of a Hattie, the rosiest and sauciest and prettiest little thing that ever delighted in worrying the life arnd soul out of a homely, obsolete, unlovable maiden aunt who wore green, goggles, and talked hateful to her mother. Becky labored to make herself thoroughly obnoxious to all the young Ethingers, and she succeeded admirably; but only Helen was patient, only Helen was forgiving and considerate, and to her Emily's eyes went oftenest and lingered longest, though Luke and Becky could see nothing good and gentle in the meek, fair child-naught but silent stupidity, and the pitiful de- ficiency of " not exactly right." It was four o'clock in the afternoon: school was just out, and the children came rushing into the kitchen, ravenous as young wolves, and making vehement calls for bread and butter. Sun-bonnets, straw hat, and dinner- basket were thrown down anywhere,-chair or floor, it was no matter; and a trinity of heated faces crowded around the half-distracted mother. Alfred demanded bread and mo- lasses, and plenty of it; Hattie's cry was for bread and milk in the big blue bowl; and May clamored for bread with sugar on it; all asking at once, all shouting to be served first, and the baby screaming its loudest in concert from the cradle. Helen came in last, and Alf dogmati- cally- renewed his violent call for molasses, "and darned soon, too!" Emily obediently hastened to the pantry in quest of bread and milk and sugar and molasses, in ac- cordance-with the several juvenile vociferations; and Helen went to the cradle, lifted the baby from a horizon- tal to a perpendicular position, and tried her best to keep it quiet. But her soothing efforts were only partly suc- cessful. It would kick spitefully and give vent to spas- modic yells of infantine rage, and keep its face, as Alfred   8G      ITELEN ETHNGERr. remarked, "Ready to cry any minute,' in spite of the womanly little sister's tender, "hush a by, by, and toss away up, and toss away down," and low chanted lullaby of -" there a there oh, baby by, there," each word accom- panied by a sedative pat on the tiny, pink shoulder nest- ling against her cheek in wriggling restlessness. It was the ordinary afternoon riot, before which Aunt Becky invariably fled to the locked seclusion of her room; even her pragmatic nature, prunellas, goggles and all, could not withstand this daily invasion of the- hungry young savages. But Helen bravely endeavored to quell the turmoil, appealing from one to the other in a voice half- chiding, half-imploring, "Hush, please, Hattie, mother is getting it as fast as she can*; do be patient, Alfred, you scare baby all of a tremble; and come here, May, I'll spread your bread real nice for you. See, mother's coming with it, and you' have n't -had to wait long," she said, coaxingly, shifting the baby-to her left arm that the right hand might be free to attend upon fractious Miss May. "But I want it with sugar on, and I want a piece all around the loaf," insisted May, eying disdainfully the plate of sweet, yellow butter, her mother placed on the table, and drawing herself up on tiptoe to more closely estimate the size of the loaf, and enjoy the anticipated possession of a big slice all around its goodly dimension. "I won't have a sugar piece. I want bread and milk, --a whole bowl full; and I want to crum it in myself," reiterated Hattie, as if the delightsome privilege of crum- ming was to be denied her. "Hurry up your molassesS!" loudly reminded Alf, drumming on the table, to add noise if not force to his' lofty command. When the requirements of each had been complied with, the uproar somewhat subsided.   HELEN ETHNGER.          87 Hattie was permitted to " crum " her bread as suited her captious fancy; Alfred made a violent attack on the molasses-cup; and May, with quite as little ceremony, went to the luring depths of the sugar-bowl, liberally helping herself, as the others did, to what they liked. In the midst of the individual grabbing, boisterous laugh- ing, and dominant exclamations, a step well known fell measuredly on the door-stone, a step that was always near when you heard it, for it was so light and precise it never admitted of an echo, and every one of them was in- stantly whist as suddenly alarmed mice. "What is all this noise about?" sharply demanded the harsh voice of Luke,- and the noise at its highest pitch was pleasanter to listen to than his low grating tones,- giving Alfred a passing cuff, which sent an angry flash to the boy's black eyes and an evil red to his cheeks, where the tears and molasses fraternally mingled in a unitedly sweet and briny flow. - "I won't have this bedlam raised every afternoon. It is strange, Emily, you can't keep these young ones under some little control. Sit down, sir! if you stir an inch, I'll take the hide off you." This to Alfred who was reaching a surreptitious hand towards the tempting mo- lasses-cup, and the sanguinary threat drove him to a seat on the edge of the nearest chair, a resentful frown dark- ening his brow, and every heart-beat surcharged with hate of his father. Hattie backed up against the wall subdued and dumb, and looked at the delicious contents of the reluctantly abandoned blue bowl in wistful silence. May crawled precipitously under the table, furtively glancing out from her safe refuge through the disordered tangles of her curly flaxen hair; one dirty, dimpled hapd held cautiously behind her, the little fingers, thickly in- crusted with sugar, tightly grasping the coveted big slice   88      HELEN ETHNGERo all around the loaf, and her blue eyes open wide in fright- ened expectation. Alfred-was often verbally excoriated by his father,--a favorite expression with that severe gentleman, derived, perhaps, from his tan-yard associations, and quite as fre- quently he made the threat comparatively good by the unstinted application of the toughest kind of birch laid on with no unsparing hand;--and as they were all pain- fully aware of the fact, it visibly destroyed the appetite of May and Hattie, and changed Helen's hushing lullaby, into a whispered plaint that lost its true meaning in the secure confidence of baby Atabel's fat neck. Having spoiled their relish for bread and butter, and made them terribly uncomfortable and angry,--bitterly angry below the fear,h--he left the culprits to their dis- trustful watching of him, and turned to his wife, who was quaking lest one or the other of them should-receive one of his strong deliberate-blows that left the crimson print of a heavy palm on tender cheeks for an hour afterwards, and made dainty little ears tingle longer yet; and the self-sacrificing mother was glad enough to bear the brunt of her husband's ill-humor, " Are you never to have any supper, Emily?" he began. "You poke all day and night finds nothing done. Some-women are eternally walking over themselves and waiting on young ones." ':I know it is a little late, Luke; but it is wash-day, and the baby has been so troublesome. I 'll have supper soon oow," said Emily, pleaantly.  " T e old excuse?! he snarled; "there will be a fine crop of grass growing under your feet some day, if you don't steps more- lively. What have you been about, Helen, that supper is not ready? but you are another drone like your mother, and not much to depend upon," looking at   89 HELEN. ETHN    GER       8 Helen crossly, almost contemptuously, and longing for some one to answer adversely ,that he might have a slight pretext for quarrelling with everybody. "I have been minding the baby since I came from school," she meekly rejoined. "Well, you had better stay home and work, for all good school does you. You are too stupid for anything else." We have said Luke never cuffed Helen as he did Hattie; but some taunts are harder to bear than blows, and this was far more cruel to Helen. Her lips quivered, and the solemn eyes settled on the baby sister hugged close in her arms, as she slowly walked up and down the floor, with the same cooing song and persuasive pats, rendered the more necessary bytheominous activityof the infant's supple-hands and feet, which werenot still a second; and she had no word or look for her father after that. Luke appeared to be satisfied with the evident wretch- edness he had created, and happily took himself off. The only amiable thing he ever did was to go out of sightand sound of his family; and that he did unwittingly,for he conceitedly thought his society very charming to his sub- missive subjects, and highly prized b them as the com- pany of the head of the house should be. Alfred signalled his welcome departure by making a dive for the molasses-cup, plentifully helping himself to more than the surface of his slice could hold, and leaving a sticky rivulet behind. Hattie unglued from the wall and began a vigorous onslaught on the appetizing com- pound of the enticing blue bowl, and they speedily emerged from under the table, each ready to act bedlam over again and inaugurate anotherlike confusion and general hub-bub. "Mother" cried May, anxious to commence the row, ' Alf 's drizzlin' the 'lasses all over thetable." 8*   -90'     HELEN -ETH INER. - "I say, I a' "t", quickly refuted Alfred; "she is doin' it herself, spillin' the sugar on the floor; only see it drib- ble on her apron; and she don't eat the bread-just licks the sugar off, and that's all." "I say, I do, all but the crust; I don't like that; and you am drizzlin' Alf," whimpered May, defending herself and accusing her brother in the same breath. "Oh, you mean little tattle-tale ! " puts in Hattie, in Alfred's defence, a person she always champions and tells fibs for without scruple. , You sha'n't play with us now, for that. We 'll run away from you; see if we don't." May hereupon threw herself flat on the floor, and ex- pressed her dislike of any such proceeding by spunkily kicking at nothing, and giving utterance 'to a series of tearless screams, all of -which Hattie viewed in calm Unconcern, and aggravated by the additional affront. "You needn't yell so, for you are a real tattle-tale; you told of me last night, and I got a slap all on your account, and you sha'n't tat, us any more, either." "I will tag i I'll go everywhere you do," retorted May, stopping her crying long enough to speak her mind. And well she did, for at the moment a shadow passed by the kitchen window,the living substance of which none of them cared to encounter. Accelerated by that in- auspicious shade, Alfred snatched up his hat and beat a rapid retreat, flinging back his undutiful comments be- tween taking great bites of bread and molasses, and push- ing towards the door. " I'll be off before he comes back with his jaw, for it will be more'n talk next time," and out he ran, followed by Hattie and May, the latter bent on tattling and tag- ging to her heart's content. The baby now worried be- yond Helen's power to pacify, and she was obliged to hand it over to her mother; and from  kitchen to supper-   HELEN ETHINGER.         91 room, pantry, and cellar, Emily hurried with it on her arm, while Helen set the table and attended to the fire. But, do their best, supper was late, and the growl of the master was heard before it was fairly on the table. "It will be ready in a minute, Luke," said Emily, womanlike, attempting a conciliatory assurance that he would have but a short time to wait, although she knew it to be worse than useless as regarded Luke and his acrid temper. The nursing infant still occupied one hand, while she was busily working about the stove with .the other, and trying her tutmost to not seem wearied and- overheated; a state of things that any man with a soul in his body larger than a nut-shell would have sympa- thized with to the extent of holding his tongue at least, and, perhaps, to the amiable filling of the tea-pot. But not so Mr. Ethinger. He was above such petty sympathy, and would hold neither his tongue nor the baby, no mat- ter how tired his wife might be. It was her place to take care of the child and get the supper; and if the baby interfered with the supper; or the supper interfered with the baby, that was no concern of his. - "Set the chairs, Helen, dear, and call Aunt Becky and the children. Baby has gone to sleep: the poor little thing has been so restless all day. I 'll put her in the - cradle, and we will have supper right away," said Emily, to her helpful eldest daughter. Helen quietly obeyed; the baby was softly tucked in the cradle, and Luke sul- lenly sat down to the table to begin his usual course of grumbling. "The potatoes are not done, hard as a stone, and the i bread like lead. I do wish, Emily, you would give me a decent meal once in awhile." " aike a smaller one, Luke. Here is one which I think  X! :i   92      HELEN ETHNGER.           - is done. They did not boil quite long enough; potatoes never will boil when you want them to; and I was so hurried," replied Emily, searching among the smoking vegetables in the dish before her husband for one not altogether hard as a stone.  They were suspiciously smooth and impenetrable for a cooked potato, but she en- deavored to make the best of it, and humbly admitted her fault. "There, try this, Luke. It seems to be better done. I am sorry it happened, and hope you will not feel cross about it, for I can't always be punctual when the baby is so fretful."  She put a mealy "Prince Albert," on his plate, and waited to see the fate of her careful selection. It was quite as she expected; he ungraciously shoved-it to one side, and snappishly replied: " I don't want it. You never cook anything fit to eat. If a man wants a surfeit of slops, let him come here." Emily did not answer. She was used to his everlasting fault-finding, but she looked miserably dispirited, and volunteered'no further attentions. In this juncture, Becky made her tardy appearance, and Alfred and Hattie and May came tramping in fresh from the pump, the hair on their foreheads very moist, and a drippiness about the ears which plainly indicated the towel had been considerably slighted. When all were seated, the business of eating commenced, to end no doubt with the customary mishaps. Some one of the children crying, Luke in extra high dudgeon, or Becky's com- plaints more long and dolorous than common. At the cheeriest it was sure to be a joyless meal, like allEthinger meals when Luke was present, and this proved to be more than ordinarily so. It was Alfred's misfortune to be placed on one side of his father, and Hattie, somehow doomed to share her  fIELEN ETHNGER.          93 rother's tribulations, on the other, thus making them woth rather too convenient to his practised hand, and the uxtaposition was by no means a pleasant one to them, lor was the dangerous proximity envied by either May )r Helen. Alfred, not being very hungry from histate mnrestricted indulgence of bread and molasses, was cul- Pably careless with his knife and fork. While attempt- ing to telegraph a knowing wink across to the observant Hattie, he unluckily dropped his fork, and it had scarcely reached the floor before a heavy blow fell on the offending hand. The child started in surprise and pain, and stared at his father without a word. "Look to your supper, sir, and learn to keep things' where they belong," said Luke, fiercely, the fire in his cold gray eyes not brighter than the flame dancing in the angry dark gaze of his son. The little fingers, a deep red from the stinging blow, mechanically doubled into a small tremulous fist, and in the way it lay on the edge of the table, never stirring     from the position where it was struck, seemed to say:     q "Luke Ethinger, you will pay dearly for this some    - day!" Hattie, in the excitement of the moment and the natural sympathy she felt for her idolized brother, acci-  -  dentally upset her cup of milk, and a sharp box on the ear was the instant punishment, administered quite as    j freely and suddenly as Alfred had been reminded of his delinquency.                        -: Her little heart swelled, and a few tears crowded to her bright young eyes, blue as dew-wet violets; a glance of mutual pity passed between the ill-used pair, and the brave thought occurred to comfort the devoted little sister in the midst of her distress: "It's only fun after all; for I am willing to suffer when   o**    - HELEN ETHINGER.  Alf does. I am just as tough as he is, and as lief be slapped as not, because it don't hurt so bad when we get slapped together; we feel so sorry for each other it takes away the ache." 4appy in the sweet love-courage Luke could not wound or suppress, she smoothed down the silky, amber hair his cruel hand had sadly rumpled, and through the curly golden mesh a sly, triumphant smile merrily flickered over to Alfred, and her companion in affliction gloomily winked a comprehensive reply in return. It was Very rarely those two sturdy souls-would cry however hard might be Luke's unexpected punishment; and that look of smiling pity and love which said so forcibly, " Good! we share alike, and gladly divide your blows, -enraged him more than all the rest. "Leave the table, you insolent whelps; and don't let me see you again to-night. Go to bed this instant," -  there was a pale glimmer of sunlight yet on the western hills ;-- "go to bed, and if I hear a  giggle out of you, I '11 make. you laugh in a different fashion," ordered the incensed autocrat of the supper-table; and, glad to get away, Alfred and Hattie hustled from the room.       J During this scene Emily sat absently jogging the cradle, Helen's eyes were fixed on her untasted food, and May nibbled her spoon in no little personal fear as to her own safety, studiously refraining from  touching her cup of milk, lest Hattie's mischance might be hers. Becky alon& seemed pleased, and threw the weight of her approval in Luke's scale. , "Them  two childern do beat all'for carelessness and impadence. If you'd any management, you'd fetch 'e under, Em'ly, or know the reason why. I'd larn 'em, if I had the handlin' of 'era. But youz never had the sense to bring up a child as it should be brought up, and as they were in-my day."   95   HELEN ETHINGER.   Mrs. Ethinger paid no heed to the bemoanings of Becky; she was quietly engaged in wiping up, the spilled milk, which was dripping from the cloth to the floor, and so on to Luke's forbidding boot, where it settled in a creamy white puddle, much to the eager delight of Hattre's little gray kittie, that was lapping away with more of an appe- tite than anybody else could muster. Poor mother, she had often seen her little children abused in this way. It made her heart ache, and though she was on her knees merely to wipe up a puddle of spilled milk, perhaps she was praying, too. When we are unhappy, our thoughts mount high, even when occupied at the meanest task. The audible sigh that unconsciously escaped her-concealed a rising sob, and elicited a rough rebuke from Luke. " Don't sigh your vitals out, and crawl around as if you were lifeless.  Stir about a little livelier, and you'd find less .time to snivel. This slouching over an hour's house- work all day is altogether unnecessary. My mother, with ten children, never made the fuss you do." "Yes, ten children," echoed Aunt Becky, with a proudly-affirmative nod.  "Ten; but they were decently brought up," with another-nod; as much as to say, " We are two of 'em," and .the myopy squint fixed in sisterly pride upon Luke as if he were the noblest Ethinger of them all. "Yes, there was ten of us; and our mother used to weave and spin and bleach, as you never had to do, Em'ly." " One might as well try to eat among a lot of pigs; and it's your fault, Emily," chimed in Luke. "You have no management, and never will have, nor common sense enough to rightly look after your-house, or control your children;" and with that he sulkily arose from the table and stalked himself off, as if he were a glorious example of a proper husband and father.  96      RHELEN ETSTINGED. When Alfred and his satellite Hattie were peremptorily ordered to bed, they really went no farther than the stairs, where they snugly ensconced themselves in the angle be- hind the chamber-door, and remained attentive listeners to all that was said below. They knew what the final backward scrape of Luke's chair meant, as well as if they were present; the sound indicated his speedy going, and a stealthy titter attested their exuberant joy thereat. Seure on the other side of the panel, Alfred disrespect- fuly made at the retreating back of his parent what the boys at school called "an awful face," and followed up the facial contortion by the unfilial remark: "The pigs are -well enough when the old hog is away. If he wa'n't my father, I 'd call him a dirty loafer, to talk so to my mother, and slap girls around, as he does. A boy can stand it; but it looks darned mean of him to be always jawin' women.'] "Hush, Alfred!" implored his mother, for the last part reached her ear, the listeners growing proportion- ately bold as the steps of Luke receded, and the crack in the cautiously opening chagher-door more prominent every second. "Well, I don't like my father, and I don't care who knows it," retorted Alfred, now entirely visible and grand as ever. Hattie peeped in over his shoulder, and, seeing the coast clear, dutifully added: "Nor I;" and complacently resumed her supper; both disobedient, audacious offenders keeping a close watch on the door, ready for instant flight should the sudden return of Luke warrant a hasty exit. Aunt Becky's hearing, as well as her seeing, was lament- ably on the wane, and she did not quite catch the drift of Master Alfred's free discourse ; besides, she was not so for- midable when her fear-inspiring brother was absent. In   HELEN E-THNGER.  these latter days she lost power immeasurably when de- nied his upholding presence, and seeming to realize her weakness, she majestically retired to the placid quiet of her own apartment. Hattie watched her scrimp calico disappear through the doorway, and then said in a reflect- ive tone, as if she had often pondered upon the subject before, stopping once in awhile to refresh her thoughts by alternately sipping from her replenished cup, and munch sparingly of seed-cake, "I don't believe anybody else has got a father like ours. Alma Churchill's father is just nice, and takes her walking with him-whenever she wants to go, and leads her by the hand, too, as if she could , not walk alone; and this afternoon he drove byjust as school was out, and he took her in the buggy with him: did n't he, Alf?" appealing to her brother to substantiate her statement. "And he lifts her away up on his shoul- der in play, and lets her sit on his knee; and she is ever so many years bigger than me. Our father drives right by us: don't he, Alf? and if he does stop, it is only to scold; and we would be afraid to ride home with him any- way; so I don't care," with a petulant toss of her yellow ringlets. "Alf hangs on behind sometimes, when he can get a chance; and I try to, but I have n't legs so long as he," looking down discontentedly at her little limbs, and heartily wishing they were as long as Alf's. "And don't I shy stones at him," chuckled her brother. "Alfred!" gravely reproved Mrs. Ethinger, shocked at the filial depravity of her son. "And lay it to the other boys," he boastfully resumed. "I made Asa Churchill take the blame of it last night: did n't I, Hattie?" it being her turn to corroborate now; "and he toed the mark like a trump, 'cause he knew I 'd get an all-fired lickin'; and it had to be one or t'other of us, for there was but the two of us staridin' where the rock 9   98      HELEN ETHNGER, came from; and oh, my golly, did n't it skim! came near taking him plum in the back," facetiously concluded con- scienceless Alf, as if it were a very commendable act to stone his father and charge the offence to a generous schoolmate.   . What could weak Emily do with such a vexatious and irreverent spirit as this? Her chiding was of no avail, for it only increased his desire to relate his evil deeds. He felt extremely proud of his aim, and was free to ap- plaud the magnanimous conduct of Asa; and he con- sidered his own skill as a marksman, though the target were his father, as well as the magnanimity of his friend, strictly honorable and worthy of all praise. ,Yes, you did, arid it was very, wrong of you," said Helen, speaking for the first time. "Yes; very, very wrong, indeed," repeated his mother, putting in a- mild word of reprehension, now Helen spoke up so bravely for the right.  "Well, I guess if you got as many knocked heads and pounded fingers as I do, you would get even when you could," he replied, in a deeply aggrieved manner, which immediately reacted on the partisan love of his adoring satellite. "(Oh, you need n't preach, Helen," said Miss Hattie, pertly, growing indignant in like degree as Alfred ap- peared injured, "for you don't like him any better than we do, only you smother it; and pretend you are so mighty good," twisting an amber-gold ringlet around her finger, and plainly letting every one know that she fully agreed with her brother in his outspoken dislike of their stern father. "When I am a woman, I sha'n't let him -boss me any more; and I 'll run away, ever and ever so far away where he can't find me; see if I don't," with a, positive shake of her curly head. - !   HELEN ETHNGER.          99 "And when I am a man, I sha'n't let him whack me- not much-and may-be I 'll up and dust before I am a man," boldly affirmed Alfred. "And may-be I'll up and dust, too," promptly re- echoed Hattie, a little foggy as to the literal meaning of his hypostatic resolution, but of course it must be all right since Alfred said it. Helen did not reply, 'and began to clear away the supper-dishes, effectually snubbed and silenced by the tart accusation of her pretty, piquant sister. lAnd this is a fair example of the daily life and home- unhappiness of Emily Ethinger and the five little ones God had given her, and heaven knows it was sufficiently bleak, discordant, and contentious. The land is full of women enduring the same slow martyrdom; full of bright young children sharing the -same perverted and pitiable sentiments; full of Adch cheerless homes and joyless firesides, rendered wretched and evil and unlovely by the domestic despotism of one selfish, ill-tempered, heartless man,--a cold, unfeeling husband, a harsh, injudicious, tyrannical father. Truly Emily paid a heavy price for the old-fashioned house full of old-fashioned furniture, the supplementary tan-yard, and- the tanner. , ; '     ? -       100     IIELEN ETHNGER. CHAPTER VII. THE SINS OF THE CHLDREN. SA'T'UDAY was a day Aunt Becky would fain have stricken out of the calendar, or else edicted that school should keep on that day as well as during the rest of the week. It was a day to be dreaded because all the tribe were at home, and what with her advanced age and numerous infirmities, old Becky found it fatiguing to wage unsuccessful warfare with the graceless youngsters. They teased, tormented, and exasperated her with un- bounded delight, and the more angry she got the better were they pleased. Becky had had her hour at cuffing and scolding them, and now, in her old days, she was at their mercy,-irreverent of her gray loops and the awful moral of the bears and Elisha; and she could no longer wrestle with them to advantage. It was a lovely July afternoon, and Alfred sat on the grass-plot near the wash- house door, pacifically selecting the ripest from the hatful of plums he affectionately held between his knees. Aunt Becky chanced to spy him while engaged in the pleasing task, and forthwith began a lengthy dissertation on the danger of little boys eating green plums, and darkly hinted that they would "set the worms to work," and en- gender a terrible spell of stomach-ache. Alfred scouted the absurdity of worms and the attend- ant pains that might ensue, and continued to select and eat with unabated relish. It is surprising the amount of green fruit a country boy will devour in the course of the year. Commencing with the early harvest apple, heis a human cider-mill from that on until late in the autumn; i  O      uthe   ,thatu  ;   HELEN ETHNGER.         101 and he grinds up withal untold quantities of unripe pears, plums, cherries, wild grapes, and gooseberries, and cur- rants,-and melons, and he don't die. He munches and munches all through the season, and he don't have 'the cholera nor bilious attacks, nor excruciating pangs of colic; and Aunt Becky's nephew was a lad of large ex- perience as a fruit-consumer, and believed he knew ex- actly the consequences. "They won't hurt me," said he, confidently. "I eat more choke-cherries yesterday than this hat could hold, and where are your worms? where is your cholera morbus? and if choke-cherries don't start 'em, nothin' will," derisively snapping a plum-stone at her venerable head to enhance the force ofI his unanswerable question. Unluckily, it hit the green goggle, and it was .a green goggle no longer. Aunt Becky's strabismus glared through the glassless rim'in appalling wrath, and she- rushed for the offending Alf with all her old-time vigor rekindled, and her outraged temper bent on summary re- venge. Alfred nimbly shied around the corner, and jeeringly called out:- "I say, Aunt Beck, if you had struck out that time where you looked, you'd a went head over heels into the swill-barrel; and would n't your shanks have looked nice sticking up like old andirons; and you'd spoilt all the swill, for the pigs would n't eat it after you 'd been soused in it." This was adding insult to injury in good earnest, and enraged Aunt Becky dashed furiously at the provoking young rascal, her heart beating no quarter, and her hand nerved to do a deed of violence should the wretched Alf come within her grasp. But she might as well have tribd to catch an untamed deer. He capered about in tantaliz- ing nearness, retreating and advancing as a cat plays '9 .   102  -    HELEN ETHNGER. with a mouse, and' finally reached the summit of his boyish malevolence by slipping -under her threatening arm, and then had the supreme audacity to put out his foot the least little bit, and, as he afterwards told Hattie, "trip the old lady beautifully." She fell sprawling, her prunellas digging into the ground, and her goggles an irredeemable mass of ruins. No sooner had her skirts settled to the lowly level of her ungraceful fall, than Alf began a brisk assault with the-plums. "I say, Aunt Beck, you jarred all the plums off the tree, you fell so hard; don't you feel them drop; and you are wearing great holes in your buskins, too. My golly, what a thing you are flat, Aunt Beck, you look like a horserake upset. You'd better take a' dose of opo- deldoc; it's good for the blind staggers." Aunt Becky clumsily gathered herself up and regained her feet,-almost bursting with rage, and went into the house, stepping like one walking on hot coals. "That boy will be hanged: I know he will. He'll do a murder yet; spill blood, and rightly die for -it," she snorted in a passion the moment she caught sight of his amazed mother. "He is full of the Evil one, and a curse to this dwellin'. Look at this," tragically holding up the shattered goggles with one hand, and rearranging her dis- ordered loops as well as her trembling rage would permit with the other. "This is what I call shameful, and the' woman as brings such a child into the world is answer- able for sins as I'd hate to shoulder. And it's you, Em'ly, as encourages him in it. If you'd brought him up to respect aged-folks, he'd not have thrown plum- stones at me. Yes, I 'll say it, and no bones either, you are responsible; and if he don't get one good whalen, it's because:I ha'n't a tongue to speak my mind to Luke." "What has he been doing?" said Emily, regarding   HELEN ETHNGER.          103 the demolished glasses in dismay. "I did not see him, whatever his fault; so how could I help it, Becky? Per- haps he did not mean to break your glasses, and is sorry for it, as I am; boys are so heedless." Emily uttered the last of her remark very doubtingly, for she was pretty sure he did mean to injure Aunt Becky's treasured green spectacles -to the full of his wanton mischief, and at the moment was exulting at the accuracy of his aim instead of being meekly penitent and remorseful for the wilful destruction he had wrought. "Did n't mean to!" angrily repeated Aunt Becky, in scornful disbelief. "You know he did, just as well as I do; and you need n't try to palaver it over. A pretty thing, to say he's sorry; he's too big an imp and limb of Satan if he'd killed a body to be sorry about it. I'd go this minute to Luke if I knew where to find him, and then we'd see if this is to go on; if I am to be knocked down whenever your children please. Did n't mean to!"- in a higher key and increasing anger- " he did n't mean to say andirons, did he; nor I'd spil' the swill for the pigs, nor nothin' about my looking like an old horse-rake upsot? Oh, no; and he is sorry for it! Well, we'll see if he a'n't afore night, anyhow," she cried, in a fine frenzy of unrestricted rage, her half-blind green-gray eyes fairly blazing, and the grizzled loops nodding venge- fully at space. The door slammed behind her with a mighty bang, that started little scales of whitewash from the kitchen-wall, and ireful Becky departed to nurse her wrath, and wait for Luke -in strict seclusion, as she always  did when the budget of her wrongs was unusually heavy, When Mr. Ethinger came home, his sister hastened to him with her piteous story, and, in proof of her sad state- ment, held up before him the remnants of her broken goggles. She was: minute in detail, and arrived at the   U   .   HEE   ETHNGE R.           . irrowing result of her nephew's unbridled wickedness most in tears, from the distressful nature of her griev-  ce. Alfred was speedily summoned and sternly ar- igned, to answer the charges his loving aunt volubly  'eferred against him, beginning with the kindly admo- tion she had offered relative to the unpleasant effects ising from eating green plums, and ending by the pa- etic recital of his insolent allusions to opodeldoc and  ind staggers. The guilty Alfred made his appearance, th- Hattie affectionately in his wake; and notwithstand- , both were inwardly shivering, and little faint spots ' in their bosom where a glad beating heart ought to  they were 'outwardly tranquil; and the iniquitous Alf, uncommonly'mild and unagitated that he seemed to - girt about by the strong arms of conscious innocence,  s as brave-looking a lad as ever approached a paternal )unal in the character of a flagitious culprit, with a iden aunt for accuser and sole witness, and a crusty ier -for judge. f  Now, sir," said Mr. Ethinger, grimly, the moment red presented himself at the bar of justice, -and the " was sharply emphasized by a firm grip on his son's  red collar; "Now, sir, what have you to say for your- ? and don't you dare to lie; if you do, I'll thrash  within an inch of your life! -  Please, sir, r won't lie, said Alf, humbly, intently ying thl cracks in- the kitchen-floor, as became a h  in his alarming situation. Hattie, poor little soul! I herself quite as guilty'as her brother, and uneasily . shed one plump white shoulderoutof her pink calico U, in sheer sympath.   i  What have you been doing to Becky?" demanded , fiercely. "I'1 have an answer, you rascal, or d you into a  jelly!'; . 9s             .4 "             I j   " Nothin'. I ha'n't touched her," replied Alf, still con- fident, though in the face of being reduced to human gelatine. "Take care! don't tell me any of your lies. How came her glasses broken ?" " I don't know. If they'm smashed, I didn't do it; 'cause I ha'n't been near her," affirmed Alf, meekly, but keenly alive to the necessity of self-defence. " You threw a stone and broke them, you scoundrel; and I am going to thrash you for that, and for lying, and for being saucy to your aunt." This cool announcement was a trifle disquieting even to the firmest courage. Alfred felt his marrow congeal, and a choking sensation in his throat implied his heart to be in a state of very great perturbation. The triple offences condensed into one punishment was too appalling for Hattie's young nerves, well schooled as they were, and the little sister gave several rapid winks, iff order to keep her blue eyes clear and the rosy lips steady. But Alfred rose superior to his fright, goaded on, no doubt, by the imminent danger of his terrible fix, andrin a moment was his sinful, intrepid self. "I did n't sass' Aunt Becky, and I did n't throw no stones: did I, Hattie? " in his dire emergency unhesitat- ingly putting the lie in her infant mouth. She readily came to his aid with theever-ready falsehood, inexpress- ibly overjoyed at the bare thought of being able so easily to save her brother from the impending threefold-thrash- ing. "No; he did n't, papa. Aunt B ecky felled; I seen her my own self."  The blue eyes, fearlessly uplifted to the stern face of her father, were very large and bright and eager with the sudden hope that she might save poor Alf yet; and the love-lighted, unflinching look made    106      HELEN ETHNGE'R. them seem truthful asan angel's.' Hattie was making evidence at a tremendous rate, for it chanced she was not present, nor within hearing or seeing distance when the affair took place; but Alfred, probably foreseeing her testimony would be needed, had given Hattie a full and' authentic account of the matter, and she was prepared for any amount-of cross-questioning. UP to this point Miss Rebecca had stood by in pleased silence, but the unlooked-for turn of things, and the boldly asserted counter-charge, completely astounded her, and she stared aghast at the undaunted little fibber. "Oh, you bad, wicked girl; you tell a story," cried she, with a withering glance of the ungoggled state. I say, I don't. You did fall, and Idid i^ our glasses snap, and Alf did n't be near you," stoutly per- sisted the small sinner, quite abashing poor old Becky, the violet eyes defiantly meeting the green-gray orbs of her confounded aunt without the quiver of an eyelash. Seven actually discomfited seventy, and sturdily main- tained the advantage. Iwas peeping through the grape-vine all the time: was n'tI, Alf?" (it was his turn to lie now,) "and Becky stumbled; you know you did, Aunt Becky; and it an't true, papa, that Alf tripped her." -"No, si- Icould nd ';ause she is so tall: I could nit begin to trip Aunt Beck," shrewdly put in theculprit, clinching the statement by kin it assume the shape of an impossibility. Well, of. all the little liars that ever I heard or seen, you two beat all!" exclaimed Becky, holding up her 6hr-velled hands in angry consternation. "Did n't throw Plum-stones, hey? didn't mention andirons, Ipose didn't insult me about the swill and a jarrn' the plum trees? didn't -but what's the useof me speakin'- I'll   HELEN -ETHNGER.         107 only be faced down, and made to seem a false-worded woman by a pair of impadent young 'uns. I might be murdered, -and that's what I expect to be, if that boy lives a year longer,-and no notice would be taken of it; they'd say I did it myself, and stick to it. You may believe them or me, just as you like, Luke Ethinger; and I 've been a sister as has worked and done for you, and never given you cause to complain; but I hope I'll be dead and moldern' in the arth afore I live to see the dis- grace of havin' one of my own flesh and blood hanged," concluded Becky, looking around with scathing indigna- tion, as if her enemies were legion, and the annihilating rebuke was intended for them all. At this seasonable moment Emily appeared on the scene: she was wont to keep as far distant as possible on these tribunal occasions, for her motherly pleadings only aggravated her husband's temper, and did more harm than good. Alfred brightened at her entrance no less than Hattie, for they were certain she brought a reprieve of some kind. "Mr. Sims is at the gate, Luke, and wishes to see you. He just drove up, and seems to be in a hurry," said Mrs. Ethinger, discreetly withdrawing the instant she had de- livered the message. Blessings on the head of Sims I his opportune arrival saved Alfred from the threatened pun- ishment, although it left Aunt Becky's wrongs unre- dressed. "I 've no time to thrash you now, but if it happens again, I 'll tan your jacket for you as you will not soon forget, and not a mouthful of supper do you get this night. There, take that, and up-stairs with you, and if I hear a word out of you, look out!"' snapped Luke. The severe "Take that" was a rap on the ear intended to be stunning in effect, but was really slight, for Alfred had   108      HELEN ETHNGER. acquired the-art of ducking perfectly, a sort of a cringe and a dodge that received yet evaded the blow, and did not endanger a fatal-concussion of the brain. Delighted at getting off so cheaply, they slunk off up-stairs, looking like twin emblems of injured innocence, there to recount their triumph and indulgence in a great deal of illy-sup. "pressed play and laugh and titter, and each in turn ex- pressing their gratitude and devotion to the other. "I lied for you real good, did n't I, Alf?" says Hattie, hitching closer to him, and eager for his praise. "I bet you did, Hatt. You fibbed right up to the scratch like a little trump. I's afraid at first you would n't stick to it-- they was such whappers; but you did not back down a peg; and I b'lieve Aunt Becky does think she fell by this time. You spunked up to her so, and your eyes were so clear and wide open like, I'll be blamed if I did n't begin to feel as if I had n't done anything." Hattie was enraptured, and anxious to still further merit his high approbation. It was a pleasure to hear him enlarge upon her personal powers of imagination, and feel the conscious sting of a generous wickedness for his sake. "I was n't peeping through the grape-vine; but I might have been: so it was only a little tiny story after all. I can tell ever so much bigger ones; and next Saturday let's be as bad as bad can be; let's go to the brook?" "Well," said Alf, meditatively, a luring vision of the stream floating engagingly through his mind. "I 11 go, if you will." "Oh, I 'll go, and we will have lots of fun!" "Yes; and we can creep down by the pasture-lot fence where the hazel-bushes grow so thick, afid nobody will see us."  "And I 'l1be careful and not get my apron wet, as I   HELEN ETHNGER,         109 did before, and he won't know where we 've been. There is piles of great yellow lilies growing in the meadow, and heaps of wild roses. Oh, Alf! it makes me tremble: I feel so glad to think of them, and what a splendid time we will have." Going to the brook was the acme of paternal disobedi- ence, and the punishment, if found out, was a terrible thrashing and days of low diet. Yet the poor little wretches braved it, as they had unnumbered times before; and, cuddled in the trundle-bed, they hatched their trea- son and planned next Saturday's rank rebellion, not in the least mindful that they were very depraved children. The yellow tresses of the girl and the dark locks of the boy trailed over the same small pillow. The glim- mering sunlight melted out of the western sky, the dusk of evening gathered in the track of the vanished day, and a star came out, like a lamnp held forth from the window of heaven, and looked serenely down on the children, - God's smile among the clouds beaming on them through all the silent night-time. Little brown hands grew sweetly quiet, heavily-fringed eyelids dropped half. re- luctantly above tender young eyes, red lips shut over voice and laugh, and fun and fear and fibs were locked up in the child-hearts, and the supperless little sinners were asleep, dreaming perchance of the meadow-lilies'and the rippling call of the brook. 10 s     .                  X   "O -lOHELEN ETHNGER. iCHA PTER VIIIL OMUTUAL SYMPATRl Y. SATURDAY came, and the resolute young plotters set about making their determination of the week previous good. A beautiful afternoon beckoned them to the fields, and the frolicking charms of the forbidden stream, siren-like, joined in the alluring sign for them to dare all and come; partly because it was forbidden, and partly because brooks are always objects of wonderful charm and allurement to, children; and thither they bent their transgressing footsteps, intent on being " bad as bad can be," which meant, with them, being happy as happy can be all the glorious long, free su-mmer afternoon, let the consequences be what they might. The brook lay along the road for some distance, and then abruptly branched off, meandering through a closely cropped pasture-lot, and so on to the swampy east meadow, where it became quite a little lakelet, shut in by a dense growth of catkin willows and luxuriantly tasselled alders, here and there broken by what Alfred unbotanically termned, "pussy-tails," and huge clumps of that ugly and vile-odored plant known to country boys by the-euphoni- ous name of "skunk-cabbage." The sweet-flag lifted its azure-blue blossoms above the surrounding sedges,--vying in beauty with the lovely wild fleur- de- lis,-the great striped meadow-lily held up its golden cup to the sun- shine, and the pale, slender primroses blushed in the grass as they passed, their brilliant abundance mutely inviting prurient fingers to seek their destruction.   HELEN ETHNGER.          " :i..  "Oh, a'n't it splendid!" cried Hattie, sitting down on a bog, and letting her two little bare, sunburnt feet dan- gle in the limpid water. Alfred was preparing to wade, and-had rolled his trousers above his knees as far as they i t would go, standing ankle-deep inthe stream while fixing them suitable for easy brook locomotion. "Splendid? I guess it is. , Oh, my Jupiter, Hattie, just '   gteethe fish jump; there's scoops of 'em!" and he rapidly churned out of her vicinity in pursuit of the startled troutlets. Hattie, left alone on the bog, looked at her pantalets discontentedly. Why couldn't girls wear :trousers, and roll them up when they wanted to, as the i  bogs did? she liked to wade just as well as Alf. How beautifully the gay little circles drifted up to her feet. Alfred's brisk churning had sent them to her, and she K  could have only the ripples of his pleasure because she was a girl. And how cool the shadow of the kittie- I I! willows and alders looked in the water. It was stupid to sit there on a bog and count them when she might be wading in their very midst. Oh, dear, why need she be a girl, and wear pantalets? But she could roll them up. Ies Yes, happy thought! and be as independent as Alf. The temptation was not to be resisted, and the next moment she was ecstatically following after her brother, greatly to the detriment of the starch in her skirts and some little loss of breath. Alfred -expostulated: the stream not quite a Lethe to cause entire forgetfulness of his father. "You must n't wade, Hattie. You 'll get all wet; and it will tell of -us; and you know that's what brought us out before." "But can't I sit on the bank and dry, after we are tired? I 'll be ever so careful; and I guess I won't get much wet." The plan seemed feasible to Alfred. He did not like   "2      HELEN ETHNGER, to rob her of a pleasure he found so enjoyable, and ac- cepted the risk. Yet he was prudent, and kindly tucked up her dress that it might not get in the water, and kept her safely on the pebbles where it was not deep. How Luke would have raved had he seen them blithely wading in-the tabooed brook, and how a better father might have envied them, sighing to recall the bygone joys of his boyhood. "My flowers will all wilt if I leave them there in the sun," said Hattie, glancing back at the flowers she had gathered on the way, and left behind on the bank. "No matter; you can't take them  home, for he will know where they grew," replied the thoughtful Alfred. '"That is true; and they are so pretty; but I had the fun of gathering them; he wron't know that, anyhow," cheer- fully resigning them to the sun, and sportively wading along beside her brother. When wearied of the various amusements the brook offered, they returned to the margin, and  when she reached the bank, Hattie was a very damp and bedrag- gled little girl indeed. Alfred earnestly advised her to get in the sun, and spread out her dress that it might dry as quickly and smoothly as possible. This was the pen- ance after sin, and both endured the self-imposed restraint without a murmur. Securely nestled in the grass they became confidential, and perhaps a little remorseful, as the afternoon wore on, Alfred being the first to hint at the restless state of his conscience. "I suppose it is mighty wicked for us to tell fibs as we do, Hattie,--a  dozen in a string, and each one- told to hide the other; it must be awful to tell so many yarns. Helen never does, and that's why I never let her know about what we do; she'd up and tell the truth, no matter who it hurt; and I 'm, sure I'd rather tell a rouser than take a  wallopin' for what a'n't wrong."   HELEN ETHNGER.         113 "And I, too," agreed Hattie, pausing and looking at the ground, in a Calculating manner, as if ruminating upon some past thought.  "How much is threescore years and ten, Alf?" "Why seventy," said Alfred, after a momentary re- course to his mental arithmetic. ( Then Aunt Becky will soon die." Hattie's voice was glad and positive. "Why?"Alfred was incredulous. "Because I heard the first class read in the Testament yesterday that threescore years and ten are all we can live, and Aunt Becky is seventy." Then her time's up," replied Alf, decisively. "Shevis most blind; so I don't care anyway, and I can peg her with anything, and she don't know where it comes from. I don't do it so much to- get square myself; it's to pay her up for the way she is always pickin' at mother before her face and behind her back. That's what I do it for; and the first time I see her alone, after she has been tellin' father a pack of stuff about mother, I just let her have it." "And I pinch her whenever I get a chance," rejoined - fattie, wishing Hier powers to torture Aunt Becky were greater, - at least equal to Alfred's. "If old Satan ever had a sister, she must be like our Aunt Becky. I chalked her out on the pantry-door last week--horns, hoofs, and tail-and may-be she wa'n't I mad when she seen it," laughed Alfred. "But Helen said it was' wicked of me, and so she rubbed it out." "I don't know as it was," said Hattie, rather doubt- fully. "She is a mean aunt, and hates me." "Of course she does, and me too." "I think it real nice to be wicked: don't you? for we always have a good time when we are bad." \10.   "4      HELEN ETHNGER.             - Hattie's idle fingers were listlessly pulling to pieces the : gold-powdered chalice of a red lily, and a shade of sad- i: ness stole into-the blue eyes thoughtfully bent on the withering petals. "I wish Helen was n't so good, Alf; for' I am afraid she will die." "What makes you think so?"Alfred started, and gazed at Hattie in amazement. "Well, Florence Buel has ever so many books full of stories and pictures, and all the good boys and girls in 'em die; so I don't want to be good; and I wish Helen would n't be, for she might die; and I love Helen." "So do I; and -it is a pity she is so good. She a'n't a bit like you, and is so queer; but she is kind, and never cross, no matter what we do to her." "She says it is wrong to tell or act fibs; I wonder if it is, Alf?" "To be sure it is; a goose would know that. And I don't, only to father; I am Lot afraid of mother: so there is no need of it with her." Hattie perceptibly brightened. "Nor I, Alf. I never, never told mamma a downright story. It seems we can't help it to father; he makes us lie somehow when we don't want to." "I like to fool him; and if he don't find me out, I sha'n't bother about its being wicked." Hattie still -chose?'{o appear remorseful, and had no heart to assume her brother's recklessness. "Helen helps mother so much without her ever ask- ing her or waiting to be told. I hate. to work; I don't like to wipe dishes and tend baby. I like to wade here in the brook and play in the dirt with you, and see you climb trees and throw stones" J   J "I don't like to work, either. I hate to split the   I ELE N    i^ Td i U^ a- D-  kindling, and turn the cows, and pick up chips," la  - mented Alf, feeling himself as great a fellow-sufferer as his sister. After this they were silent for some moments, Hattie absently fingering her faded flowers, and Alfred stretched out on his back, his knees drawn up until the soles of his bare feet were square on the ground, and drowsily studying the altitude of the sun through his straw hat. It was a day and an hour and a place to be lazy and silent. Bird and bee and insect were abroad, full of life and music, and nature held jubilant revelry in the midst of her joyous subjects. With a flight of flame and a gush of song, the red-winged blackbird darted through  the pendent willows; the meadow-lark floated up from the grass, rivalling the notes of his brilliant neighbor; ? while a bluejay, daintily perched on the swaying bough of an alder. piped a challenge to all feathered creation, defiantly nodding his gayly-crested head, and brassily flirt- ing across the pool to his modest mate hidden deep in the  tasselled shade on the other side; and the merry bobolink  whistled his call from the secure density of an adjacedtghul-  rush,--the jolliest songster of the feld, a m adlyjmirthful fellow,. never still of wing or voice. The truant ramble : were environed by sweet sounds, beauty, and fragrance, "  and they seemed a part of the lavish splendor of the scene. "We have had a grand time: have n't we?" said Hat- tie, as if that were a certainty, let what would come. I 've had my flowers, if I must leave them here; but I should like to take them home to Helen; they would soon look fresh again if put in water, and she is so fond of lilies: don't you think I might take a few?" Alfred at once vetoed the rash measure. "No; it won't do. They will tell right off where we   HMw     HELEN ETHNGER, have been. Let them go; you have had the pleasure of picking them; and we have heard the'lark and the bobo- link-hark, there he is now,-link, link, bobolink! Oh, a n't he jolly? You can't do it, Hattie! Listen; lhe is there on the bog." Alfred jumped to his feet, and, despite his admiration, could not resist sending a stone whizzing after jovial Mr. Bob. It was getting towards sunset, and they started for hoie, satisfied they had had a fine time, and there was othin0 g -about Hattie's rearranged toilet likely to betray tef,-- They did not walk very fast, and an hour passed before they reached the grain-lots along the -road; skulk- ing under cover of the wild vines and bushes skirting the fences, they were quite sure to escape discovery, and this -they did with the utmost care and silence, for there was no knowing when Luke might be driving along the road. The highway was gained without mishap, and Alfred was about to leap over into the road when he hastily drew 'back and peremptorily lifted a staying hand. "'Hsh! there is a team coming." And both went out ofsight in the tall, ripening wheat: the bushes at the spot beiig-Arce,and the wall low, overtopped by a stake and ridfence, such as thrifty farmers delight in. i"It's father," says Alf, breathless, taking off his hat to decrease his height, and cautiously peeping between the wall and; the lower rail. "Yes, as sure as you live, it is father. I know old Folly's trot. He is going to the vil- lage. Good, we   will make tracks for home, and get there just in -time for supper. A minute more, and he would have caught us fair in the middle of the road. We had to cross, and a cat couldn't hide on the other side." They crouched lower in the wheat as old Folly ambled past, slightly turning her knowing old head in the direc- tion of the waving grain, but Luke had not the animal   HELEN ETHNGER.         117 instinct of his horse, and stiffly drove by, unconscious of the near proximity of his children. If he had looked back, -a thing he seldom did, and which so favored Alfred's safe " hanging on behind,"--he would have seen the rim of a shabby straw hat and a soiled white sun- bonnet stealthily peering above the wall, and two youth- ful faces, depicting mingled relief and alarm, fixedly watching his receding wheels. The moment he was out of view they boldly scrambled over the fence, and scam- pered for home like frisky young colts, and bounced in at the gate, where Helen stood anxiously waiting for them, in fearless glee. "Where have you been so long? Mother was getting very much worried on your account." "Now, Helen, don't you ask; for I'll have to tell a story if you do, and I don't want to do that," replied Hattie. "We have been playing, and having a good time, and we are ever so hungry."  And they were off like a pair of wild antelopes.   "8      HELEN   ETHNGE. CHAPTER IX. THtE GRIEFS AND DENIALS OF CHT DHOOD. rlHE holidays were fast approaching; it would be - Christmas in a week, and Alfred sat on the wood- house steps, -busily engaged in ,making a sled, in antici- pation of the snow carnival hovering :in:the bleak Decem- ber sky, a:nd -the threatening -aspect of the cold, blue bank piling sullenly in the west. He had been so em- ployed for an :hour; but his mechanical genius, or mate- rial, or both, perhaps, were sadly :at fault, and his efforts all ended in disappointment. It was a rude attempt at best, fraught with exasperating failure, and looked the clumsy -sir it was, -- one runner higher than the other, the cross-piece unplaned and warped, and a wriggling ap- pearance generally that was very discouraging to contem- plate. Alfred looked at it gloomily, tears of vexation in his eyes, and a  heavy feeling of defeated hope at his heart. The big nails would split the old hemlock board they would not drive straight; he could not get the run- ners even; he tried to see if it was solid; no, it would shake, and was a weak, ugly thing, that no nails or faith could make firm. He stood^ it upon end, he turned it over, he balanced it on one side, he whittled there and pounded here, but all his endeavors were useless. Hattie sat a silent spectator on the door-sill, and Helen, standin a little apart from her sister, was also a close observer of the unsatisfactory work, both deeply interested and anx- ious for his success, and hoping each nail would drive better than the last. Finally, in a burst of angry despair, he dashed the   HE LEN  ETHNGER.        119 hammer into the chips, sent the nails after it, and pas- sionately kicked the unwieldy sled shapeless. "The darned nails won't hold," he cried, giving full imit to his rage; "and it will snow to-morrow, and I won't have any sled. I never have anything like other )OyS." "If I hold the board down while you pound, may-be it   ; will not split," said Hattie, looking pretty and helpful enough to even induce a rough, refractory hemlock:board to be laccommodating. "No, it will not do any good. It 'll wriggle any way you can fix it, I wish I had a sled like Frank Buel's. His has got a reindeer painted on it, and that's its name, too. Inever have a knife, or a kite, or skates, nor a ball, Dr a sled, nor anything, I've got such an all-fired mean father." "Oh! hush, please, Alf," says gentle Helen. "Don't talk so; it is wicked, and not right to say it ofh father; because he is our father." "I don't care if he is; and I'll say he is mean, if I've a mind to." "You have as much as we do," put in Hattie, dimly  n: conscious that Alfred was unusually wicked, and the re- eounting of her privations might somewhat reconcile him to his own. "I 'd like to know if we ever have anything nore than you do. Alma Churchill has a whole tea-set, a real sugar-bowl and tea-pot with a cover, and such lots of )ooks full of lovely pictures, and Feo. Buel has a- great fax doll as big as Anabel, with real hair, and shoes you ,an take off, and a Noah's Ark; and what have Helen und I got? just nothing at all." Asking and answering ler own question with an immense air of resignation. "You have a very nice dolly, I am sure," said Helen, rying to make Hattie satisfied with her one indulgence.   120      HELEN  ETHNGER. "Oh, an old stuffed rag-baby, with a face and neck like a harp, and its eyes and nose are inked on; that's no doll at all! and the cotton comes out of her leg, and she is limber and crumples when you set her up. We never have any Christmas, nor New Year, nor birthday. Flo does, and so does Alma, and they have a Christmas tree every year, and old Santa Claus comes down the chimney and puts goodies in their stockings," Alf, so far from believing the last, curled his lip skep- tically, and in so marked a manner, that Hattie thought it her duty to tartly reaffirm her words. "I say, he does: Winny Churchill told me so, herself; )  guts candies and toys and lots in 'em while they are asleep. Don't he, Helen? and they never know a breath about it till morning." "Why,-Santa Claus is their father, and you are a silly- head not to know it. Mr. Churchill puts the things in their stockins, and it's a whapper to say it is anybody else." Hattie saw the full extent of her humiliating credulity, and was crest-fallen and silent. "I wish the holidays were over," lugubriously continued Alfred.- "All the boys will be eatin' candy and nuts next week, and crowing over their presents, and we won't have a penny the more; you see if we do." "But the girls don't crow," replied Hattie, reviving - sufficient to speak in defence of her friends. "Flo di- vides, and so does Alma; I am sure to have goodies when they do."  "Yes, I know; and so does Asa and Frank, that is, they offer to divide; but I won't take it, for it looks like spunging." "I do," says Hattie, less sensitive on the point of spong- ing, smacking her lips at the prospect of the coming sweets. ,       t0   HELEN' ETHNGER.         121 "Frank gave me all my pocket would hold last year, and he's promised me more this time." "Well, I won't take it, and I won't even so much' as look as if I liked candy," proudly maintained Alf. "Then what makes you take it when I divide my part with you; and you know I always do-?" "Oh, it's no matter with you; but I'l11 not let the boys see I care a snap." What more he would have said must be left to conjec- ture, for at this period a gaunt figure enveloped in a gray shawl appeared from behind a pile of wood, and Aunt Becky's old voice quavered a meddlesome reprimand. "Into mischief agin! your father will give you for meddlin' with his tools; got the hammer and auger and nails strewed all around, better put 'em back in the chist as you found 'em, or you 'll ketch it," and she went on into the house, leaving them to act on her advice or otherwise as they liked. Alfred sent a maple chip after her, parenthetically remarking, as it hit the gray shawl and lightly hung fast in the coarse fringe: "Threescore and ten times up!" Whereupon Hattie began to titter, looking wisely across to her brother, and together they hustled from the wood-shed, leaving Helen to pick up the scattered tools and replace them in the "chist." Now, it happened that Emily was an unseen listener to the above conversation, and that evening, after all'the children were asleep, she sat down at her work-stand, with its endless array of mending, firmly resolved to ask a favor of Luke when he came in. Aunt-Bcoky sat in her cushioned arm-chair in the opposite corner, labo- riously breathifig and nodding in the dismal way old ladies will doze and sway and respire, and which is so "   122      HELEN ETHiNGER  particularly disagreeable when you feel their room to be fart more preferable than their drowsy company. Luke came in, bringing with him a whiff of wintry air, pulled off his boots, and set his stocking-feet up on the stove-hearth to warm. -Boots came third after over- coat and hat, and at that time a man is usually affable, if there is any complaisance in him, and Emily chose it as her moment to approach the better nature of Luke. She carefully broached the subject nearest to her heart, by a brief allusion to the weather, her eyes fixed dili' gently on her sewing, and her voice a little husky from the struggle going on in her breast: "It looks like- snow this evening, Luke; winter seems to have set in early." "Yes; it was snowing when I came in." Silence of five miftes, and no sound audible save the snapping of the fire and Aunt Becky's impressive breath- ing. "Next Thursday is Christmas; is n't it Luke?" "I believe so; have n't noticed particularly." " Again silence, and some rapid stitches taken on Emily's part. "I suppose the children-will expect a few little pres- ents. Appalling silence, and  a suspension of Aunt Becky's vocal respirations. "I thought we would surprise them byr a Christmas gift this year, if you don't mind, Luke." Mr. Ethinger shifted one blue yarn sock over the other, and Becky revivified into complete consciousness and habitual opposition. "I don't see why they should look for a present. I have not promised them any," said Luke, frigidly. ' Neither have I; but you know it would please them so much, and make Christmas such a happy time to them."   HELEN ETHNGER.         123 "The children are not so remarkably good, that they should deserve anything; and I have other use for my money," shifting the blue yarn sock back again, and freezing more solid every second. "Alfred is all the boy we have, Luke; and I should think you could afford it as well as Mr. Buel." Emily was skilfully touching upon one of her hus- band's weak points, for he liked to be considered as rich as his neighbors, although he did not make equal display. "Afford Alfred what?" he asked, with great asperity. "A- a sled; it would please him, and --" "A sled!" interrupted Luke, expressing as much sur- prise as if she had asked him for a steamboat. "A boughten sled!" resonated Becky, adding her as- tonishment to that of her brother. "'It is no more than other boys have," rejoined Emily, quite sharply for her; " and, as we have but the one boy, I think we can afford it." "One boy! Don't harp on that, Em'ly; the one you have will come to the gallows yet," pungently rebuked Miss Becky, visions of plum-stones and horse-rakes rising freshy in her mind. "I never could see the sense of crammin' childern at Christmas, and wastin' money in trumpry toys they get tired of in a day, and that you have to pick up and stumble over all the rest of the year. It wa'n't so in my time, when childern had mothers as knew how to bring 'em up," with- a withering glance of the dim old squint, which, though sightless, still re- tained the chronic habit of turning maliciously on the person addressed. "It is foolishness to stuff a child with candy one week to make it sick all the next. It only sets the worms to work; better give 'em a dose of vermi- fuge or senna than have 'm a groanin' and a keepin' folks up of nights, with their stummic-ache."               ,   124      HELEN ETHINGER. "A -sled is not candy," said Emily, annoyed at the length and severity of the old aunt's officious lecture. "I would like that for Alfred. The girls might do without, or put up with something cheaper, as I am certain they wouldbe w illing to do if Alfred had the sled." "A sled, to tear his clothes into tatters, and break his neck ridin' down hill head foremost?" ',-Well, then, skates; perhaps he would like them quite as well," reluctantlv conceded Emily. "Skates, indeed, to fall and break his head, and get under the ice and bring him to his death. If I was in Luke's place, I'd see he did not have either, for there's boys been killed afore now by havin' skates and sleds." "You need say no more- about it, Becky," interposed Luke.   "I don't need your advice in the matter. I am not given to spending my money in that way, and I am not likely to commence now. Hattie and Alfred do not merit presents; Helen is too old; and May is too young to-:care for such trash," and the frown upon his brow Emily knew to be conclusive. The hope was dead. Alfred was to be denied the sled, and the bitterness was to grow in his heart unalloyed by one kind act of his father.  But the mother had yet another unexpressed wish in her breast, and she timidly gave it voice,-the fate that had overtaken the first making her doubtful of this, espe. cially when that harpy of a Becky sat there ready to croak her querulous!objections. 'If"you think the sled is too expensive, of course it must be given up; but more than that, I was going to ask your consent that Helen might study drawing.  I had planned that to be her present; and oh, Luke, I beg do not/deny me' this. She is so good and talented, our oldest daughter, Luke, and so fond of painting, and all   HELEN ETHNGER.     j    125 that is gentle and beautiful; she could go to the academy this winter, and I am confident some day she will repay the expense of tuition -yes, a hundred times repay it," she implored, growing eloquent in her earnestness. If Luke was confounded Becky was not, and took up the cudgel with sardonic zeal. "Paintin'! Well, I vum; what next? Em'ly Ethin- ger, what is it you mean to do with your children -spile 'em completely? Paintin'! Better larn her to weave, as her grandmother on our side was n't too good to do; it's the safest way to dispose of her talent. But there's the old sayin', Put a beggar on horseback, and he'll ride'-paintin', hum! well, we are gettin' up in the world!" Emily winced under the spinster's harsh tirade, and saw the cudgel pass over into the scarcely less lenient hands of Luke without regret. "If you have discovered a talent in Helen, it is more than I have ever been able to do. If a girl must be stu- pid in order- to seem talented, then I admit she is in a high degree; but I am not going to gratify her folly, nor yours, Emily. It is my impression that you have taken leave of your' senses, the little you ever had, and so I t" go to bed and leave you to find them again, if you can." He suited the action to the word, and the chamber-door that shut rudely behind him shut also on Emily's heart. Becky always outstayed Luke when there was any indica- tion of an extra bit of confidence passing between them, and on the present occasion, so- long sought by Emily, she had managed to wedge herself in, and venomously sting at every opportunity. The condition of her eyes prevented her from seeing the slow, heavy tears dropping one by one on the little worn faded garment Emily was mending - Al- fred's torn jacket. His arms seemed to be in the lifmpsy "*  * .                 ,     128      HELEN ETHNGER. sleeves, and they were reaching up to c1asp her neck as they used to do when he was a baby--her second baby. Poor mother-! She cut out the ragged portion of cloth above the patch she was neatly inserting in the elbow, and the aggravating hemlock boards and the boy's angry words of complaint were all she could see and hear. She felt in what narrow confines his childhood was being cramped, his disposition ruined, and his brave, generous nature crushed. And Helen--her beautiful genius must run to waste; she must live and give no expression to her soul. But Helen would be good and patient through every trial. In and out the steady needle kept its busy thrust, now and again passing through a small damp spot where the bright, warm tears had fallen. Becky arose to take her departure for the night, mutter- ing a half indistinct remark about the "born and bred folly of some women," with which ungracious innuendo she disappeared, the last of her poisoned arrows buried in Emily's heart, and the quiver of her malevolence empty. Mrs. Ethinger put away her work and crept up-stairs to thurgery,- -a long, low apartment where she and her children slept, a good distance from Luke in the, south bed-room, and Becky in the square room below Istairs. Snugly cuddled in the warm blankets, her boy slumbered sweetly, and no shadow on the smooth young brow of that dreadful prophecy of the gallows. "Oh, my son," she softly whispered, "I tried hard to secure the pleasure for you, but in vain. I can give you only my love, my kiss, my poor weak prayer." And in the dark and cold, with the first storm .of winter battling furiously without, she knelt meekly down beside the trun- dle-bed, folded her hands, and bowed her head above the little sleeping face, and humbly asked God to bless her l   HELEN ETHNGER,         127 boy; this child denied a childhood, this quick, fierce tem- per hedged in and irritated by injustice and wrong; prayed the kind Saviour to keep him in his tender care, and guide his wayward youth from going sinfully astray. If Alfred Ethinger was poor in a father's guidance and affection, he was rich in a mother's love that he might safely trust when all other earthly forgiveness was re- fused him, and all other love cast him out. CHAPTER X. AUNT BECKY'S TIME IS UP. N the morning, Aunt Becky complained of a serious all-gone feelin' in her chist," and she believed her- self unmistakably a " case." She really did not believe anything of the kind; it was merely a favorite expression of hers when not feeling well; but it was so in reality this time. She had taken a heavy cold the day before, -Alfred disrespectfully said he thought she caught it standing in the wood-shed interfering with his sled- making,-and the physician pronounced it a violent attack of acute pneumonia. When Alfred heard him say it was a dangerous case, considering the advanced age of the patient, he went directly to Hattie with the news, and they unanimously agreed that pneumonia was a human ailment greatly to be pitied since it had tough old Aunt Becky to deal with; and the carriage of Dr. knight stop- ping twice a day at the gate was to them a matter of in- tense satisfaction. The benighted little heathens had no knowledge of what a dangerous sickness meant, nothing   128     - HELEN ETHNGER. of the awfulness of death, its solemn panoply, and the charity. we should extend to one about entering the gloomy shadow whence, from this side of eternity, no ray of light ever penetrates. Of a surety, Aunt Becky's " time was up;" there was no doubt of that. Her blood was thin, her form with- ered, age had shaken and chilled her bones, and the sud- den cold was the end,-the children's old enemy laid helpless on her bed unable longer to vex them by tongue or hand, or fix upon them the vengeful malice of her crooked eyes. Alfred bore the want of a sled bravely in the consolation anid excitement of Aunt Becky's being "mighty sick," and peeped into the room where she lay, gaunt as death itself and muttering unintelligibly in her feverish- sleep, with many winks and nudges to Hattie, who kept more timidly in the background, nervously afraid of old Aunt Becky now she had no cause to far her. Nothing could induce Alf to enter farther than the door- sill, for he had serious misgivings that she might unex- pectedly revive and resort to the inexorable buskin. He saw the toe of one peering from under the valances, just where Becky had placed it the night she took it off forever, and it more than ever convinced him of the wisdom of keeping a safe distance-between him and the sufferer. Christmas morning dawned clear and bright, but the house still wore its mysterious quiet and gloom; the dark angel lingered at the threshold awaiting the hour it was given him to enter, and his sombre pinions were stretched over the Ethinger homestead like a pall, hush- ing childish steps and voices, and filling older hearts with awe. Emily, forgetful of past unkindness, was ever at Becky's bedside, and Helen, tenderly active, was always striving to be useful, and waited upon her aunt with gentle assid-   HELEN ETHNGER.          129 uity. She softly brushed the gray loops and arranged her cap, smoothed the pillows and straightened the covers, bathed her forehead, ran here and there and everywhere at everybody's call, and did it all so quietly. and willingly that Becky's hard old nature was touched, and once did she soften to the new, sweet influence sufficient to say, as if anxious to make reparation for past injustice: "You are a good girl, Helen, though I've allers thought you wasn't exactly right; but mab-by I've allers been wrong that I come to make the mistake." Helen was soothingly passing her hand over Aunt Becky's wrinkled brow where the painful ache and throb- bing never ceased, and sometimes it was so great as to cause the poor old creature to groan aloud in her distress. It was such a relief to feel the soft, moving pressure of that little untiring hand, how could she help but soften? what heart of stone could have resisted it? Helen returned no answer, but the small fingers passing along the wrinkles' trembled slightly, and the tranquil eyes looked down at the grim old face in pleased sur- prise.. "Would you like to study paintin', Helen? You 're a queer child, as children goes: I 'll stick to that; but mab-by you've a talent that way, as your mother said, though I'm too old and ignernt to understand it." "I should like to study drawing, Aunqt Becky, but- " Helen paused, and a little sigh finished the sentence. "But what?" blunt and sharp, like Becky in health. "I can't. Father does not care for it." "How 'do, you know he don't? did you ever ask him?" "No, I never did. I feel so sure he would not approve of it." "You mustn't feel sure of anything; now tell your father to come here, and see you don't come back till he is gone."   130      HELEN, ETHNGER. Luke came in obedience to the message, and Becky aroused herself to unwonted animation in pursuance of the good object she had in view. "Luke, you must n't think I am out of my wits, but since Em'ly mentioned it, I 've been thinkin' you might let Helen larn paintin'. She's the only one of your chil- dren as has 't ill-used and worrited me- past tellin', and I'd like to leave her something as she'd be likely to re- member me kindlyfor." "Well," said Luke, in laconical half-concession. "I'm not like to get off this bed agin, with the cold and the ache and the fever I have, and I 'd ask it as my dyin' favor that you'd let the girl be humored in what her mother wanted should be her Christmas present. It 'as been on my mind ever since Em'ly's foolish beggin' of you that night, and seein' Helen 's sorter strangely good to me, now I'm down, I have the wish in me to do her a kind turn, and perhaps I might die the easier for it. I would never consent to the sled for that bad boy, butthe paintin', Luke, I' d consent to that." "Well," said her brother again, laconically as before. "And you will promise, Luke?i  "Yes, if you are set on it."  "  Well, I am; and I 've been a good, hard-workin' sister to you, as never troubled you much with askin' favors or makin' complaints." "Yes, Becky, you have been a good sister, and if it will please you at this moment, I give you my word Helen shall be humored in what I believe to be the greatest nonsense you ever advocated in all your life." "I advocate it dyin', Luke, and you may thank me for it some day. It will please Em'ly, poor spiritless creeter that she is, more'n if I were to leave her a fortin' of thou- sands; and the girl will be none the worse for a little grand edication."   HELEN ETHNGER.          131 "Very well; have your way, I'll not oppose you," said Luke, in conclusion, and, agreeably to Becky's request, he retired, and Helen returned to her post. "You are to larn&paintin', child, your father promised me that much; and he 'll keep his word, for I've been a good helpful sister to him, and when you are a fine lady makin' fine pictures, remember as it was your old Aunt Becky as got the chance to larn for you." Helen said not a word of thanks, but she laid her two fair little hands on either side of the faded old face, and her lips touched gratefully the shrivelled, fever-flushed cheek, where no kiss had been for more than half a century. "I will remember, Aunt Becky, always remember." A feeble, unsteady hand went up to her nut-brown hair in a rambling caress as strange to the hand as it was to the head awkwardly fondled. Poor old Becky was a nov- ice in all love's tender ways, and almost unknowingly the melting at her heart expressed itself in the gentle act. "It's my belief you are not exactly right after all, child, or you wouldn't kiss ugly old Becky. There, there, go tell Em'ly she is to have her way; it's a pity you have n't a mother of better sense, though she's had a hard row to hoe off and on." It was midnight, the last day of the year, when the summons came for Becky to depart. Luke stood at the bedside, solemnly austere and composed, looking vacantly at his dying sister and counting each gurgling breath that was rapidly telling. away her fast sinking sands of time. It was the long-labored dying of senility, and for two days the gasp and moan had been going on in that close-curtained room so many years sacred to Becky's individual use. A whisper half inaudible reached Luke's listening ear, and he bent his head to catch its full meaning.   132      HELEN ETHNGER, "' Helen," faint and brokenly the whispered name was thrice repeated. "Helen, Helen, -don't forget, Luke, the child is to learn paintin'." ',pis was the finale; Aunt Becky's time was up, and hr hard old heart still forever. While rosy youth and- Iealth slept beautifully above, meagre old age lay stark land cold in the room below in a sleep that knew no waking. In the morning, Helen said gravely to the awed and wondering Alfred and Hattie:- "Aunt Becky is dead, and you must be very good and quiet to-day." "Dead, my gollj!"Alfred gave a start of surprise, and looked as if he had rather not be at home just then. "A'n't you afraid, Helen: I am?': shivered Hattie, glancing around in superstitious fear. No, I am- not afraid." "When did she die?"Alf was more curious than -grieved., "When we were all asleep, at midnight; mother told me about it this morning." "Have you seen her, Aunt Becky, since -since last night?" "No, not since last evening, and she did not know me then; but after breakfast we will all go in and see her." E'I sha'n't," said Hattie, determinedly, drawing nearer to her brother, who was also a little daunted by Helen's quiet proposition. ' I sha'n't go a step, for I know she 'd run after me, and- be a ghost wrapped up in a sheet. And it 's New Year's, and Alf and me are going to make a snow-man."  Helen finally succeeded in convincing them- that Aunt Becky was not a ghost, and would nots chase them rolled up in a sheet,--the uncompromising spectre Hattie's youth- ful mind conjured up,-and soberly assured them it would   HELEN ETHNGERt,         133 not be nice to play while their aunt lay dead in the house. "But I don't care," said Alfred, more truthful than reverent. "It a'n't no matter if folks do die, if you don't care for 'em, only you can make believe sorry; and I guess, Hattie, we will not make our snow-man to-day." The logic Alfred displayed touching his bereavement quite disconcerted Helen, and she felt herself a sermon- izing hypocrite in the light of his artless candor. After breakfast, as Helen had said, the three were con- ducted to the room where Aunt Becky lay. Alfred had persuaded Hattie to change her mind, and she followed close at his heels, graduating her own alarm by the calm distrust she saw in him, and which actuated the bold Alf to keep very near the door, and leave a safe distance be- tween the object of their supernatural dread and the means of egress. "Seems to me she looks mighty queer," said Alfred, in a cautious whisper. "And she will never chase us with the buskin again: will she?" asked Hattie, in a still lower whisper. "Never /" replied Alf, with lurking satisfaction; "nor tell tales of us, either." Becky Ethinger was too little loved, and too little de- serving of affection in her lifetime, to win genuine tears at her death; and children, in instances of the kind, are never dissemblers. And she was not so much changed as they thought, only icy cold, awfully still, and ghastly white; but there were the indurated lines of wrinkles crossing the neck and cheek and brow, the loops of gray hair standing out from her rigid cap, the stiff, homely face, and the lean, sallow hands grimly folded on a breast only a  little colder than it had been during life. The dress of blue calico, the aggressive prunellas, and       134      ' HELEN ETHNGER. the stern, green glasses were laid aside, and with them she had put off mortality. A twinge of remorse disturbed Hattie's forced equa- nimity. "A'n't you sorry you broke her goggles, Alf?" "Some," in a deeply penitent tone; "but' I'm sorry most I tripped her." "And you threw chips at her no more than two weeks ago. Don't you think she will be a ghost, and come back, for that?" "How can I tell? I did n't know she was going to die so soon, or I wouldn't have chipped her," replied Alf, extenuatingly. "What do you want to rake all that up for now?" glancing uneasily at the rigid outline as if mutely asking its pardon, and afraid of it at the same time. "Come, let us go; and you stop talking your hate- ful things about what I've done, for I can't help it since it 's all over with." A patter of 'careful feet, a silent but hasty itreat through the partially open door, and Aunt Becky was un- regretfully left to hel' majestic solitude and the sublimity of an endless repose. Emily remembered one kind act,- just one,-and for the sake of that single good deed she forgave the con- tempt and harshness of years; for Becky left to her bro- ther's daughter 'a rich legacy in the simple uncultured words, "Helen is to larn paintin'." Six feet of withered grass were removed in the village churchyard near the spot where Jane had lain for many winters, the brown, frozen earth scooped out, and in that cold, narrow bed old Becky Ethinger was laid away to await the judgment; buried amid fast-falling snow, that whitened the heap of brown, frozen earth, and fell in spotless purity on her plain coffin. It sifted down still   HELEN   ETHNGER.       135 and peacefully, like a benediction from the skies, and perhaps was God's merciful harbinger of his infinite love and forgiveness. The next day at school, when the boys -were narrating the fun of the holidays, Alfred proudly boasted that they had had a funeral at their house, and a jolly sleigh-ride coming back from the grave. And the same week Helen began her course of drawing lessons at the village academy. CHAPTER XI. I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU, MOTHER." IT is said a woman's work is never done, and especially 1 was this true of Emily Ethinger. After thinking everything/was finished, there was always something left to do. The yeast to set for to-morrow's bread, apples to pare for:}0-morrow's pies, a luckless rent to mend, or. some unavoidable task of the kind, and the clock was usually oi the stroke of twelve by the time she was ready for bed, td be up again next morning by five o'clock, and the same dull programme of yesterday to go through with. As before stated, Luke could not endure the noise inci. dent to unreasonable infancy, and slept as far from the sound of midnight squalls as the south bedroom would admit-of, leaving the entire care of the children, with all their youthful ailments of whooping-cough, croup, and measles, to his wife, serene in the selfish belief that it was her place to attend upon them, and what did it matter if her rest were broken; and surely it was no excuse why she should rise weary and unrefreshed in the Krerning.   T136      HELEN ETHNGER. The momentary suspension of the domestic machinery occasioned by the sickness and death of Aunt Becky were speedily resumed after her burial, and life at the home- stead settled back into the old turbulent channel. Luke's crabbed nature reasserted itself with redoubled harsh- ness, and, with the exception of having no acrimonious echo in his sister, he was more crusty than ever. Spring again set the green signet of her glad coming on the hills, the brook leaped away from its icy chains, and daisies began to star the meadow and twinkle along the roadside. The eventful winter gave way to uneventful summer, and when all others had apparently forgotten, a child's gentle hand planted a small white rose on Becky's humble grave, each fair blossom and tender green leaf seeming to say, "I will remember, Aunt Becky, always remember," and surrounding it with at least the semblance of a grateful love. The regular afternoon tumult had been more protracted and clamorous than common, Luke's indiscriminate chas- tisement more severe, and Emily's distraction jnore com- plete than had, occurred for some months past;- and so altogether it had been one of Mrs. Ethinger's very dark days. How thankfully'she looked forward to the even- ing and the children's early bedtime, when play-tired little bodies merrily sought their nightly rest, and she could sit alone and muse uninterrupted on the day's past toil and trials. No pleasant brooding, but the saddest quiet is often preferable to bustling forgetfulness, and with her baby in the cradle, and her work-basket near at hand, Emily had stitched and thought away many lonely hours. A rush of clattering feet up the stairs betokened the united scamper of the young Ethingers for bed, piloted by Helen, who in vain endeavored to maintain order, each trying to get the start of the qther, and all eager for the white pillows.   I-ELEN ETHNGER.         137 It is well worth some slight degree of personal discorN- fort to be an unseen observer of a troop of unruly chil- dren getting themselves composed for sleep. They will say so many quaint things, offer so many gravely ludicrous remarks, and enaat so many solemn absurdities, that you are alternately made to laugh and cry without scarcely being aware of it. And so it was with Mrs. Ethinger's unmanageable troop. Little bare feet went pattering everywhere over the floor, little night-gowns were dragged from under the briskly overturned pillows and slipped on any way, for Helen's patient readjusting and tying-- May was certain to complain that hers was on "hind side before," and Hattie, in the same strain, declared hers to b0 "wrong side out," and several minutes were consumed inI getting them straight. Then the four knelt side by side at the foot. of the trundle-bed, Helen first and Alfred bringing up the rear with a sly dig at Hattie, who re- turned it by a smothered titter that induced May to half crawl out of her place to see what was the matter. This "saying their prayers " was a mere habit, a cere- mony they had been taught to go through with the same as undressing; and Hattie and Alfred frequently stopped in the middle of their evening orison to exchange opinions regarding some topic in which they were mutually inter- ested, or interlope a private whisper, much to the aggra- vation of Miss May's tattling curiosity and devotional disquiet. Helen finally persuaded them to hush and May to curl down beside her again in a proper attitude of wor- ship, and then commenced the little prayer so familiar-to every ear. "Now I lay me down to sleep,"began Helen, slow and distinct as became the words,-and three young voices blithely followed in chorus: "Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep;" but when it came to "God bless father and mother," -Alfred stuck 12*   138      HELEN ETHNGERS at the first, and seemed to be considering the propriety of the request before making it. "I don't believe God will do it. I would n't," whispered Hattie, mistrusting the cause of her brother's - sudden embarrassment. "Let's skip it, Alf," and, heedless of Helen's earnest remonstrance, the innovation was promptly adopted, and God bless dear mamma to papa's exclusion finished it. Supple little limbs jumped into bed, and in five minutes the three naughty, troublesome Ethingers were fast asleep, and only Helen's great mournful eyes left openi to count and recount the flickering shadows on the wall. A shaded chamber-lamp burned dimly on the stand and gave curious shapes to the furniture; phantom forms peopled the corners, and she fancied the circle of light on the ceiling to be the pale reflection of some de- parted glory. She did not turn her head when a slow, tired step ascended the stairs and her mother, with her infant sister in her arms, entered the room. Emily sat down in the midst of her sleeping children, and all the pent-up grief and hopeless dejection of that and many days surged uncontrolled to her heart. She thought of the past and dreaded the future of her little ones, for would they not leave home and mother as soon as they could grasp for themselves freedom and indepen- dence? How far away and how small seemed their clam- orous shout for bread and molasses? They might tyran- nize over her in their childish thoughtlessness, but she could never love them less. We can forgive a child anything seeing it asleep: it may pinch and bite and kick and scream, and be unwar- rantably hateful and malicious all day, but at night, asleep, we kiss it, and find a- tender excuse for all the hatefulness that was so trying when it was trotting around in search of mischief. This was Emily's feeling, and the M          9   HELEN ETHNGER.         139 flush of slumber rosily mantling each velvet cheek made them blameless as angels in her eyes. Little tawny hands toss carelessly above a quiet head, little feet peep from under the tumbled covers, little' hearts gently rise and fall, and grow older with every measured pulsation. Emily bent and fondly kissed the son and daughter who worried her the most, and whom she vaguely felt would leave her first. It was a mother's anxious, prayerful kiss, containing much of secret pain and 'a conscious fear that she herself lacked the judgment and strength to bring theml up aright. It was a sad, self-accusing thought, and one that humbled and distressed her beyond expression. With her sleeping baby on her knees, poor Emily covered her face and silently cried. Softly, piti- fully criedr alone in her sorrow and tears. She did not know that a pair of grave brown eyes were mournfully fixed upon her; and a piteously sorrowful picture was that for a child to see. The kitchen-clock struck one, but Emily did not stir. Still and solemn night only broken by the sighing fall of a woman's tears - a mother's voice- less heart-plaint, a wife's dispirited moan,. Noiseless as the shadows, a little figure stole from the bed, a slender arm crept about her neck, and a beseeching, "Don't cry, mamma, don't cry," was whispered on her lips. "You awake, Helen, and so late?" "I could not sleep; sometimres I hear the clock strike away on to morning. God knows when we are awake, and feeling bad all alone in the dark; and Hlove to think it is His beautiful light I see moving on the wall."l "My precious daughter, God indeed richly blessed me when you were given to me; and I was crying to think how, by and by, my dear ones will all grow up and leave m-e." "I will never leave you, mother." a ( ,   HELEN ETHNGER. The child of twelve was a woman already, and had begun her life of self-denial. "I often hear you moan in your sleep, and.murmur so sad and sobbing like, that my heart gets aching, and my head gets thinking, and I can only whisper, 'Poor mother! poor mother I' over and over again, until the' words have no meaning to me. But when I am older, when I can work and do everything for you, then, mother, you may be happier." The mother -caught the sweet comforter to her bosom, and all she could say was, "Helen, my precious child, Helen !" in accents of tender, tearful love. Helen glided back to bed full of the sacred promise she had given to never leave, her mother, and a promise that must be as religiously kept as Aunt Becky had said her brother Luke would keep his; and Helen's father (let it pass to his creditin after days) had faithfully fulfilled his pledge. Mrs. Ethinger lay down to rest, her baby nestled on her arm, the little hands and lips about her breast recall- ing no pleasant thoughts of the father, as that dainty, searching baby-touch brings to better loved and happier wives, and better loving wives, perhaps. The warmest, dearest, most perfect love at her heart was Helen.   Time goes on just as fast with the unhappy as the happy, and scapegrace boys spoke of old Luke Ethinger; and Alfred flippantly talked:of the old governor, or told. his cronies of the tricks he played now-a-days on the "old chap." The neighbors said Alfred was a wild lad, that would give his family trouble yet,- a sharp, quick-witted, high- spirited boy, spoiled in his bringing up. He was just at that age when a slight circumstance makes or mars for a   J I l   lifetime, and his violent outbreaks and reckless threats had-more than once frightened his mother. Age had not improved Mr. Ethinger's disposition or softened the stern severity he ever practised towards his children, and they were subject to his despotic will as absolutely as when they were helpless babies. Hattie was a light-hearted little beauty, who had an immense respect for sister Helen, and an intense'love for brother Alfred. May had outgrown her early habits of tattling and tagging, and was the last one to tell tales of Alf and Hattie now, though their misdemeanors were greatly in excess of what they were when she was barely able to lisp of their transgressions. Luke had not prospered in his business of late years: a rival tannery somewhat injured his affairs in trade, and a speculation he entered into failed, involving him in a tedious lawsuit that finally went against him, incurring heavy costs and no end of hard feelings. One day, in a surly manner, he curtly informed Helen that it was time she had set herself- about something more profitable than painting, if she continued to need food and clothing; for he had all he could do to get along, and she(must learn to support herself. Helen made no reply,-she seldom did to any of his rough remarks,- but the next day she ap- plied for the village-school. She was seventeen, tall of her age, and serious enough to be twenty-five. By dint of hard, plodding study she had obtained a good English education, sufficient to meet the requirements of the rising generation ofBergen, and possessed withal a strong spirit and a patient heart. Her passion was for painting, and many dreams she had of future fame and profit to be won through the doubtful and laborious medium of pallet and brush; yet she was no mean artist already for one so young, and her four years of instruction had not been  "2      HELEN ETHNGER. thrown away. - She might never be a fine lady, but she could paint fine pictures; although they brought her no food or clothing, and contributed not a dime towards her support; so she must abandon art for a while and do that which attested its worth in tangible money, however dis- tasteful the pursuit might be in comparison with the one laid aside. Helen's audacity in -applying for the district-school astonished herself after her request was sent in, and the dread of examination lay dark and distrustfully before her. But since she had made the venture unadvisedly, she was resolved to await the result bravely, and do-her best to merit success. Hattie was considered brilliant, and superficially she was rightly esteemed a wonder for learnlng. Mr. Eth- inger's purpose was to make a teacher of her; and with that commendable object in view he sent her three quar- ters to the academy, believing it to be a judicious invest, ment that, by the time she was/ of Helen's age, would re- turn to his pocket redoubled. As for Alfred, that young gentleman smoked any quantity of cheap cigars un- known to his father, bet on horses whenever he had a chance, went fishing' on Sunday, and depredated about E the neighborhood generally, until the rumor reached the ear of his stern sire that "Alf Ethinger was a tough case, marked out -for. early ruin, and old Luke would soon begetting the benefit of hitraining." Luke heard, but did not heed the warning as he should have heeded it. On the contrary, his rigor towards his son increased, and almost every day a conflict of words and blows took place between them--words and blows on Luke's part, and a dogged, dangerous silence on the, part of Alfred. Anabel, the youngest of the flock, was now five, a fair little winsome girl, with much of Hattie's blonde beauty   HELEN ETHNGER.         143 and sparkling ways, and Mrs. Ethinger's life had settled down into a groove that left her free from the care of young children to worry over the wild, wayward doings of older ones. CHAPTER XII. SPEAK A KIND WORD FOR HELTE X. A VERY different sort of man from Luke Ethinger was Squire Churchill, a social, good-natured home father and husband, who always had a cheery word for his son and a kiss and smile for his wife and daughters. And the cry, "Father's coming I " when they were little like Luke's children, brought the whole brood hovering around him, just as the cry "Father's coming I " sent all of Luke's scattering away from him in large-eyed fear and haste. Squire Churchill came into the sitting-room where his family were gathered after tea, at that genial hour between twilight and  dark when we feel particularly conversational, took his youngest daughter and her bat- tered dolly on his knee, tipped back in his chair, and very carelessly remarked, as if it were a matter of small interest to him notwithstanding he confessed himself sur- prised:                ,  "I was just a little taken aback to-day, more on account of her youth perhaps than anything else, and, possibly her assurance. Who do you think has applied for the district-school this summer?" None of them could guess, and Mr. Churchill was obliged to answer his own question.   -   "4      HELEN ETHNGER. "Why, no other than Helen Ethinger." "Helen Ethinger!"Asa Churchill aroused himself from his recumbent attitude on the sofa, and looked wonderfully interested. The squire was the most influ- ential of the school trustees, and whomsoever he favored was quite certain to be installed teacher at the old red school-house on the corner. This Asa knew, and was all attention to what his father said, after he heard Helen's name mentioned. "She is such a queer girl, not a bit like Hattie," said Alma Churchill, as if weighing the two in the balance of her opinion and finding Helen slightly wanting. "Queer! she is nothing of the kind," sharply refuted Asa; "because she is not a frivolous, empty-headed, and empty-hearted babbler, you girls presume to call her queer; and it is downright slander for you or any one to say it." '"Well, you know what I mean," corrected Alma, dis- mayed at his warm accusation of slander. "She is so silent and thoughtful for one of her age. She don't seem to me like other girls, with her great, dreamy eyes, where something dwells that I could never make out."  :I'll tell you what it is, Alma; it is soul, and one higher than we can understand. Helen Ethinger is a woman of grand courage, and pure and good and patient beyond few of us to imitate." "Goodness, Asa I believe you are hopelessly smitten, to rave in this style," said Alma, regarding her brother curiously. "Pshaw!" he turned from her abruptly and addressed his father in a more moderate tone. "I do not see why you should be in the least taken aback.. Helen is fully competent to undertake the re- sponsibility. I know that much; and she has as good a right as anybody to the school." ght'iis, anybody t-   HELE N ETHNGER.        1-45 "Do you think so?" rejoined the old gentleman, doubt- ingly. "Certainly I do. She has more real sound, practical knowledge than you suppose, and what she does know, she knows thoroughly; it is no smattering with her, I assure you, sir. I would not hesitate to set Helen Ethin- ger's solid sense and ability against that of any young girl in the county. Trust me, sir, she will make an excel- lent teacher."' "And would n't you like to go to school to her, Asa?" slyly remarked Alma. ' I have been to school many a day with her, and I presume that amounts to nearly the same," coolly replied Asa. "She writes an elegant hand, and the application itself was about as neat a bit of composition as I have seen for some time. What say you, Winifred, to having Miss Ethinger for your teacher this summer?" said the squire, appealing to the little pet daughter on his knee. "I should like her very much, papa. She has suich a sweet voice, she could not scold loud like Miss Berry; and she has such small hands she could not shake us very hard ; and so I 'm sure I'd love Miss Ethinger ever and ever so much."' ' Bravo!"/cried Asa, patting the sunny curls of his little sister. '"Winny has the best reason, after all, and you should not deny her the weighty advantages arising from the sweet voice and small hands, father." "Well, we will see about it," laughed the squire, de- positing Miss Winny on the carpet, and sauntering out on the piazza to enjoy his .custonSary evening cigar, whither Asa soon took, occasion to join him. "I say, father, tip the school in Helen's favor, will you? ' 13 .         -.   "6      HELEN ETHTNGER R  She is abundantly qualified; and there is not a child in the district that toes not love her."  , And some that are not children, eh, Asa?" mischiev- ously winked the noble old squire. "Well, well, boy; she shall have a fair chance, I promise you." Asa snapped off a leaf from the Michigan rose-bush. growing at his elbow, and absently twirled it in his fingers, while revolving another proposition in his mind a little more embarrassing- than the last, for it inclined a little more towards undue partiality. it And, if you please, father, let the examination go as light for her as you can consistently. I would not have your preference so marked as to produce idle comment, nor do I think she needs it on the score of efficiency; but I'd like you to speak a kind word for Helen, and make it as easy for her as possible." "Oh, Asa, son, you are head over heels in love with her; that's as plain to be seen as that star yonder," said the squire, shaking his wise old head gravely and looking above the tree-tops to where fair Venus sat, bright and solitary, in the deep blue ether of her throne. "Deuce take it! no, I am not; but, bang it, can't a fel- low speak a good word for a girl without his being in love with her? You know they are half frightened out of their wits before the examining committee, and always appear to the very worst advantage." '"Asa, you are twenty-two, I am sixty; and you can't throw dust in my eyes so readily. I was just that spoony after yoursmother once." /' Never mind; have it so if you like, only treat Helen generously."  Why not Patsey Odell? She is also very anxious to obtain the school," suggested the squire, puffing at his cigar with great sedulity.           . O   HELEN ETHNGER     .   147 "Patsey Odell; pooh I! She is not Hljen Ethinger, and does not possess one-tenth' of her ability." "Nor beauty; is n't that it, lad? Poor Patsey!" "No, neither Helen's worth, beauty, nor genius; and' that is the unbiased truth." The old gentleman laughed at his son's earnestness, threw away the remnant of his cigar, and went back to -the sitting-room, firmly convinced that Asa's heart was in an inextricable tangle regarding the eldest of Luke Ethinger's daughters. Asa was very well contented with the impression he had made, and felt confident Helen had nothing to fear from his father. A mellow whistle drew musically near, coming from the direction of the dense Norway spruces that partly obscured the handsome iron fence, and a moment after Frank Buel strolled into sight. "Just the fellow I want to see!" ejaculated Asa, hur- rying down the path to the gate. "Halloo, Frank; hold on l"  Frank instantly halted, and his whistle came to an abrupt termination. "What's the row, Asa? House on fire?" "Oh, no, merely a walk in your company. Pleasant evening, is o't it?" glancing indifferently over the dusky landscape. "Anything new up your way?" "Nothing whatever. Stagnant as the Dead Sea." "'Then it-is surely dull enough; but guess who is a candidate for the district-school this season?" "Could n't: fifty have applied. Abby Turner, perhaps." "Not as I am aware of; but Helen Ethinger has." "Ah, indeed! I  fine girl that, Asa, though not ex- actly the sort I fancy," philosophized Frank, slowly walk- ing on beside his companion, and his manner suddenly that of a sage.   "8  .   HELEN ETH I'NGE. "You may well say a fine girl; and, Frank, suppose you get your governor to go in strong for Helen; he is one of the trustees, you know; the right word will fix it firm in her favor; and she is an old school-mate of ours, so we are bound to help her along all we can." "I'll do it, by Jove!" declared Frank, emphatically. "I presume your governor will go for her?" "Yes, certainly; that is, I think he will- in fact I am quite positive he will." "Then it is a sure thing; and I tell you truly, I am mighty glad of Jt," "No more so than I am," replied the delighted Asa, taking Frank's arm by way of privately expressing his gratitude. Frank had no inkling of what it meant; his mind was so full of the subject in a different sense from that in which Asa viewed it.          i "A plagued hard time those girls have of it with old Ethinger's snarling and' spite. He would not let Hattie go to Flo's birthday party last week; and he knew she had been reckoning on it for -a month. Never forbade her going until the very afternoon of the party; and then because she cried -and who the mischief would n't?--he locked her up and made her go without her supper, the confounded old sinner! Hattie told Flo all about it the next day; and I call such conduct the essence of imean- ness." "I have heard that Lukelwas capable of no inconsid- erable malignity. He hates father terribly on account of that unfortunate lawsuit." "He hates everybody and spares nobody. Alf ran away, and brought to Flo the story of his sister's bitter disappointment, and that she was a close prisoner, on short rations, in the garret. Now, was n't that abomina- ble? Alf waited until the old vinegar-cask was abed,   HELEN ETHNGER.          149 and made a run for it. Hattie said the remainder of the night after his return from the party, he slept in the wood-house loft, on a pile of dusty old carpet. You may depend the girls and his mother kept shady after they missed him, for he whales the boy unmercifully. Good- hearted little chap, too, and would have been nothing so wild as he is, if his father had ever treated him half de- cent, and not thumped him around so." "That is true, Frank. Poor Alf has always been ill- used by his father; and unless Mr. Ethinger pursues a different course towards him, some day, not far distant. he will be compelled to defend himself against his son." "And   serve him  right, the old bear!" applauded Frank, with energy. "You do not believe he is actually cruel to the girls, the same as he is to Alfred?" "Well, no; although he used to punish Hattie, for the smallest offence, quite as severely as he did Alf; but he tries his best to make them wretched. He has lost a good deal of money within the last two years; and I presume that does not serve to sweeten his temper. They say the house is mortgaged to its full value, and no doubt that accounts for Helen's desire to teach." "You are probably right; if so, she deserves the school more than ever," "Yes; and we will urge our respective sires so elo- quently and effectually in her behalf, that she will get it." The two friends walked on, arm in arm, and the topic of the Ethinger sisters was not again mentioned during their evening ramble. At the time, Asa was studying law in his father's office, and Frank was a   bookkeeper in his father's store. Both were young men of established good morals and more than average capabilities. A sa was particularly so, and   150      HELEN ETHNGER. the fond old. squire lived in the proud hope of one day seeing his boy a distinguished member of the bar, and the indications were that his worthy aspirations would ultimately be gratified. It was an eventful moment in Helen's life, the afternoon she set out to undergo the dreaded ordeal of examination; but it was not half the terror she had imagined it to be. The committee were remarkably affable and lucid in their questions, and studiously refrained from propounding any of their usual complex and unnecessary riddles, kept ex- pressly for the bewilderment of young aspirants, and ut- tered in stereotype phrase every examination day. This marked omission showed conclusively that Frank and Asa had completely won over their kind-natured gov- ernors, and the august and learned committee were but acting on the hint of Mr. Buel and Squire Churchill. It was near sunset when Helen started on her return home with her certificate to teach in her pocket, and the first bold venture of her existence, made in pursuance of duty, bravely achieved. The smiling young spring lay joyously upon the earth, a happy promise in every blade of grass beneath her feet, in every weed crowding above the soil, and she fancied an April day never before boasted so fair an aspect.. "How pleased mother will be." That was the thought uppermost, and she kept repeating it to herself as she went along the grassy road-side, so often travelled to and from the old red school-house in her companionless childhood./ A tall, athletic ..figure vaulted over the wall at the very spot where Alfred and Hattie had timorously lain in am- bush and watched their father drive - by years ago, and Asa Churchill warmly extended his hand. - I congratulate you, Miss Helen. I just heard of your success, - met father coming up from the village, - and I am- -sure you deserve it,'   HELEN ETRINGER.         151 Thank you, Asa. J, mean to try and deserve it at least." The grateful eyes she lifted to his face made him retain the little hand, and sent a happy thrill through his heart. " '                 "If you get beyond your depths at any time in this new business, you must let me help you out, as you did when we were little folks, walking this same old road to school." Oh, I am often beyond my depths, and if I asked you to help me out every time, I fear you would have no lei- sure for any other occupation. I know who helped me to this success. -I see the trace of your kind hand through it all; and, oh, Asa, believe me, I am very, very grateful." The tears in her voice touched a tender chord in his breast, and he thought again, "What a noble girl she is." He wanted her love, not her thanks, and hastened to explain: "Oh I did not have anything to say, that is, not much ; but I think Frank Buel did.  He is a splendid fellow,- - the heart of a prince," lauding Frank to the skies in order to escape himself. "And so has Asa Churchill-and his father," she looked up with a faint smile, that faded away in a grave anxious gaze. "I am going to test your friendship yet further, Asa-. You have heard the sad stories they tell of Alfred, that he is going the evil way that leads to ruin. You are a man, he is a boy; can't you save him; cannot you say a word that will be heeded before it is too late? There are many things at home he does not find pleasant, -much that Hthat we cannot hinder, that we cannot guard against, or save him from. Won't you try, Asa; oh, dp promise me that you will?" Her hand fell pleadingly on his sleeve, and all her troubled soul shone in-h up- lifted eyes.           ;   152.     HELEN  ETHNGER, The words Asa was about to utter died on his lips. She was thinking of her brother, not of him, and a jealous sense of slight-- a sudden pang of wounded love and resentfulness-put an end to 'his blissful hopes, and he replied almost coldly: "I'll do all I can, Helen; you know that. I'll do anything in the wide world for you," pointing his willing- ness by a most injured emphasis on the pronoun. "Then don't look as if I had somehow offended you." He could not withstand the shy: gentleness' of those humid eyes,-and his heart grew tender towards her again. The reply he meditated was cut short by the advancing thud of hoofs rapidly nearing the brow of the hill, and before either could think of flight, had such been their intention, which happily was not, Luke Ethinger ap- peared in full view directly ahead of them. He came to a dead stop in the middle of the road, and surveyed them searchingly, a cold gleam of anger in his eyes, and his manner that of Arctic frigidness. "You had better go home, Helen. You will find quite as good and safe company there as you are likely to meet with here." Without deigning the smallest notice of Asa, he gathered up the reins and drove on, Helen looking after him in pale consternation, and her limbs trembling so she could hardly stand. "Do not be frightened, Helen; I love you, and H" "Oh, don't, Asa; pray, don't say another word. I will have to answer for that look to-night," she hastily inter- rupted. "Well, answer, and tell him -" "Oh, please,please do not say it: not now; never, for I cannot listen," she implored, shivering from head to foot, and retreating from the impetuous grasp he laid upon her arm.         ' ' '    HELEN ETHNGER.         153 "Then let me look once in your eyes, if you will not listen,-if you dare not, just once, my darling, and- I will be content."-- And a strange look- was that she gave him -a mingled look of love and fear and hope and despair as made his- heart ache to see; yet it satisfied him. "That is all I ask, Helen. I will wait, but I must kiss you by right of the unspoken promise, and that, with you, I know will mean eternal possession." She stood silent before him, neither refusing nor accept- ing his fervent kiss, as passive as if she were dead and had no power to respond to it. They parted there in the hazy April twilight,. Asa to dream of the time when-she might be nearer to him, and Helen to repeat over again the weary old refrain: "It can never, never be!"Asa must go out in the world and win his proud renown; she must stay at home and walk the narrow circle wherein her duty lay. He must win for himself fame and'a leadership among men; she must resign her higher tastes, and sink to the commonplace, lot of a district-school teacher. So fate divides the paths of those whose hearts are closely united, and abrogates the love that no disparity of fortune can alter or make less dear. Mrs. Ethinger was overjoyed when she learned of her daughter's success in securing the school; and in listening to the ardent expression of her mother's delight, Helen forgot in a measure that vengefully ferine look of her father. But she was painfully reminded of it when, an hour later, Mr. Ethinger entered the room where she was sitting with May and Bell, and without preface or the shadow of delicacy, blurtedout, in his curtly compendious style: "What do you think of yourself trq be found traipsing about with old Churchill's son?"   154      HELEN ETHNGER. "Mr. Churchill merely stopped to extend to me his good wishes," she replied, quietly. "Good wishes for what?" "That I have obtained the school. You said I must do something towards supporting myself, and I have suc- ceeded in doing so." Luke, for the moment, was disconcerted, and looked surprised; but he soon regained his old bitter, taunting tone and manner. "Got the school, hey! well, I did n't give you credit for either the brains or the energy; but don't let me hear of you gadding around with that sneaking young Churchill again." Most fathers would have been proud of the alliance of a daughter with a gentleman like Asa Churchill; but Luke Ethinger was not.-- His selfish disposition argued right the reverse. He judged all natures by his own, -and thought that Helen married would be very little help to him, while Helen'single would always be earning him something. Besides, he detested the squire, and all who bore the name of Churchill, for the simple reason that he had been the opposing counsel, and beaten him in the disastrous lawsuit that so prostrated his financial affairs; and, furthermore, there was that malice in his heart which revelled in blighting 'the dearest hopes and pleasures of others. Seeing Helen was not inclined to answer, he continued in the same insulting strain. "If you were not quite brass, you would know it is not proper to be making promises you dare not tell of." "I have made- no promises, sir, not a word- -" a kiss. was burning on her lips, but that was not a word. "Mr. ,Churchill is a gentleman, who would not. say to me what he would fear you to hear or know."   HELEN ETHNGER    .     155 "Oh, a mighty fine gentleman, no doubt; the son of an old liar and cheat, and it is a pretty sight to see you straggling along the road with a man at dark." This was too much. "Stop l" she said, rising with commanding dignity. "My little sisters are present, and this injustice I cannot take from you in silence." He wantonly assailed the truth and honor of her womanhlood, and she arose to the grand sublimity of de- fending it calmly haughty and resolute, as .he was con- temptuous and jeering. "So, ho! the school-madam so soon gives us a taste of her airs; but it won't do with me, my lady,"- angrily sneered her father. "Excuse me; I cannot remain longer to share in a con- versation of this kind. Come, May,". and in a proudly sorrowful way she quickly left the room, followed by her wondering little sisters. 9         ^    VU      xi JU  INI ^ DU xi IAN xi i -CHAPTER   XIII. MUTTERINGS OF THE STORM. ELEN entered upon her new duties courageously; and that summer and the next taught the district- chool to the entire satisfaction of everybody. As Asa ad predicted, she made an excellent teacher, and parents, pupils, and trustees were alike pleased with her. "Mr. Ethinger had decidedthat Alfred should have six lonths' tuition at the academy preparatory to his becom- ng a clerk in Mr. Sneed's grocery store, there to acquaint Limself with the intricacies of country trade on a small cale, and barter eggs and butter and feathers for tea nd soap and coffee, and an innumerable variety of similar Lousewife necessities, across a greasy counter to snuffy Id women, who would be forever disputing his correct- ess in weight, measure, and prices, and forever doubting is capacity for making the right change. This was the ausiness Luke had marked out for his son, and it was bout the last occupation in the world Alfred would have hosen for himself. Hewillingly went to the academy, iut vowed in his heart that never under any consideration vould he accept the grocery-store proposition, however ternly his father might urge it. Herwas a fine scholar, nd had talents and taste for better things, but he was a eckless, headstrong, and, some said, a dissipated youth, vhose finer attainments were in imminent danger of being wallowed up in the whirlpools of passion and vice he iaily courted, if not actually took part in already. It was ten o'clock, and Helen stood in the kitchen- loorway searching the misty night- for her brother's re-   +^n^, ,r I JU IER.       157 turn, for she knew he would come that way, and so avoid the front gate and his father. Mr Ethinger was also absent; and if Alfred would only come before he did, that she might know he was safe in bed, and no peril of their chance meeting, in which case a fierce altercation was certain to ensue, the consequences of which she dare not - think of. While she stood there anxious and watchful, a dark figure glided along within the shadow of the grape-vine, and she stepped aside to let her brother pass in at the  open door without being seen by him. Evidently some- thing was wrong of a serious nature, for his eyes were bent moodily upon the ground, and his step, though rapid and noiseless, was more that of suppressed anger than ordinary stealth. "Thank God he has come, and not a moment too soon!"  she thankfully whispered, for at the instant her father came  in at the hall-door; but the look she gave her mother set that poor trembling soul somewhat at ease, for lhe well understood its significance, and knew it meant 'Alfred 's come," just as plainlyas if she had heard the  vords uttered. "Is Alfred at home?" was the first question asked by  dr. Ethinger on entering the presence of his wife and lalghter.  Yes," said Relen, answering briefly, and seeming in owise disturbed, notwithstanding she saw he was in an ausually gruff mood even for him, the cause bcoming  parent in his succeeding remark:           -m "I thought he would be at home this once anyway, for I  essed him down handsomely three hours ago, and he will  irse a  sore back the rest of the nighlt, if I am a lyjudge; d   it is only the half I have in store for him if I hear of lounging around taverns and pitching dice again. ,14                    .    HELEN ETHNGER. Mrs. Ethinger grew deadly pale, and Helen clasped ler hands one over the other in a tight pressure, as if she vere suffering some sudden bodily distress. 'He -he did not say anything about it," faltered Emily, glancing in alarmed inquiry towards her daughter But the expression of Helen's face, still and colorless, re- plied to her in the negative. "He means to pout over it, no doubt, but I 'll take the pout out of him in a hurry, and dust his coat for him as he never had it dusted yet," said Luke, bringing his fist down on the table with a forcible thump, and looking literally sardonic. Helen lingered a little while so as not to attract a sus- picion of her intentions, and, unnoticed by her father, left the apartment. Up the stairs she sped light of foot to Alfred's room, paused a second before the close shut door, to still the swift beating of her heart, and then softly lifted the latch. Sitting there by the one gloomy little window, in the murky dimness and oppressive silence of the moonless night, she saw a slight boyish form bent forward until his head rested on his folded arms that were crossed for its support on the narrow window-sill, and the whole sad at- titude was that of the deepest depression. "Alfred." The name fell from her lips in pitying tenderness, and she made it the more gentle by lightly kissing the little portion of brow not buried on his arm. He lifted his head with a quick, impatient start, and the fixed, savage sternness of his white face blanched hers to marble. "Is that old brute home?" he asked, in a voice of con- centrated bitterness.  "Oh, Alfred, try-and forgive him, and, because he is      HELEN ETHNGER.   159   our father, spare him those hard epithets," entreated Helen. "Forgive him? look here." He pushed up his sleeve, and exhibited the red swollen ridges cruelly disfiguring hig arm. "Do you think I will forgive this? No, by the great Lord, never He whipped me like a hound again to-day; but I tell you, Helen, it is the last time he will ever enjoy the fun without sharing in it himself in a way he will not soon forget." Helen passed her hand lovingly over the poor bruised arm, as if the touch might soothe the pain and soften his-- pale anger. "I admit it is harsh and cruel, Alfred, unnatural and unjustly severe; and if these piteous marks are not on my body, they are ten times deeper on my heart, and there, at least, I suffer with you. But how did it happen, what was it that aroused his anger so terribly?" "I met him as I was coming home this evening,- and: you know I'd rather meet Satan any day,-and, without a word of explanation, he jumped out 6f his wagon and commenced beating me furiously with his whip. I spppose he had heard something at the village, andi pounced on me at sight; but the next time he lays his hand on me,"-and a fierce oath curled the beardless lips -"father or not, we will have a tussle for it. I 'll stand it no longer. I have borne all I ever will of his parental brutality; and I 'II teach him the boy has the spirit of a man, and that he shall not trample on it at pleasure." "If you love me, Alfred, do not indulge such dreadful threats; remember, father is getting old, and -" "And why should I care for that?" he angrily inter- rupted. "Did he not take a mean advantage of me when  so0     HELEN ETHNGER. was little and unable to defend myself, save by lies and rtfulness? Ever since I can remember, he has beaten nd abused me, and I presume he thinks he always can. ,nd then, just see how he treats mother. You know as tell as I, what her life has been and is with him! )ld 1 I wish he was so old that he could not stir hand nor Oot, and I had the management of him; by the Lord, I'd ,ay him up with precious -good interest, and make him ustily cry mercy; but I am ready for him, and I don't ;ake all the blows hereafter." He was too much enraged and too excited to listen to his sister's milder counsel, and Helen allowed him to free his mind without interruption. "I'll never be'anybody here. I meant to do some- thing once, but he is constantly-calling the worst of me uppermost, and I go down hill instead of up, like Frank and Asa. They have fathers that know how to make men of them; but mine -he puts the devil in me, and then pretends to be surprised when it comes out, as it does pretty often now-a-days. As I told you before, I suspect he thrashed me to-day for hearing I had been throwing dice at Decker's; and what did I do but turn straight around, go back to the village, and throw for the drinks until this hour." "For the what?" asked Helen, hardly comprehend- ing his meaning. "For the a --the amusement of it," blushed the boy, ashamed to repeat the word he had inadvertently used in her presence. "I did it to s how him how little I cared for his authority; and when I get wild and desperate, I don't value a penny what I do. I wanted to be a civil engineer, for I know I could do myself credit in that line; but he has no higher ambition for me than an underling's position in a dirty country grocery-store. But it 's no go; I 'll bolt first, and he may do his darndest."   HELEN ETHNGER.         161 "And in all this did you never once think of mother's anguish our poor mother, Alfred, who has certainly loved us, and been ever kind and comforting, whatever others may have caused you to suffer." Helen knew the tender chord in his breast, and the real y strong affection he had for his mother, below the sur ce; of his seemingly careless and undemonstrable na- ture, "Yes; mother has always loved me, and a deal better than I deserve, too, for I 've never taken much trouble to mind what she said," he replied, a tinge of remorse in his tone; and then with more animation, "I tell you what it is, Helen, she fevls every blow he strikes me worse than I do. The other night, after that lick he gave me, she came up here all of a tremble, and sat down -there in that old chaii, and -cried ready to break her heart - a strange kind of la noiseless cry as I'd not like to hear often, and know I: had been wicked to her. She thought I was asleep, but I was n't by a long shot, and could see her breast heave,-as I lay with my eyes half shut, and her fingers running along the hem of her apron, as if they did not know' what they were doing. Then she came and tucked the bed-clothes smooth around me, and kissed me two or three times. I could feel her face all wet, and the quiver of her mouth, and that is something I can never forget of my mother." He dropped his head to the window-ledge, and burst out crying like a girl. Recent anger and vindictiveness died within his breast at the recollection of his mother's grief, and left him utterly dejected and crushed. * "Oh, Alfred! I do feel so sorry for you; but when you have these-dreadful quarrels with father, think of mother, and be forbearing for her sake; surely there must be a reword somewhere awaiting the long-eudunig." "*   62     H ELEN ETHNGER. Alfred's brow clouded at the mention of his father's lame. "I do try; but I have not a woman's patience, and ,annot endure wrong after wrong like you girls; and rou seem to be blessed with a larger supply of hope and- t put-up-with spirit more than any of them." "Yet I sometimes despond and faint when I should be Jhe strongest. I learned to endure, not from choice, but necessity; and perhaps God had some wise purpose in subjecting me to the hard discipline that, as a child, I often found so difficult to bear." "That may be; but I don't mean to be everlastingly knocked about, for it is not the discipline I admire, how- ever you may believe that God is at the bottom of it, which I do not; ascribing it solely to the natural infer- nalness of Luke Ethinger's temper; and if Hattie don't play a joke-on the old man some day, then I am mis- taken. She is like me, bound to get even, and only wait- ing her chance. I wonder how the devil he thinks any of us can care for him? I don't, that is certain; and I guess he understands it pretty well, too, by this time, for I am at no pains to conceal it," rejoined Alfred, getting resentful again, and the angry blood mounting to his cheeks in a hot, feverish glow. Helen placed her hand under his smooth chin, -fair almost as her own,- and lifted the flushed, handsome face to the dim star-light; and very low and earnestly she said: "Alfred, in those wild ways of yours, are there any habits which lead to vice, -to the death of honest man- hood, and early self-created misery?" He could not look up in the asking eyes of this noble sister and tell a direct lie. He could not answer that gentle, pleading voice by subterfuge or falsehood.   HELEN ETHNGER    .     -163 "Well, I am not sure, Helen. There are lots of things I do that don't exactly jibe with my conscience. -Not that I care a copper for father --I do it mostly. to spite him-but things which I know you would not approve of. There are a great many places around the village, and lively doings going on, that girls don't know any- thing about; and I go there, when I have had a flare-up with the old gent, simply to cool my temper, forget my grievances, and take part in all sorts of incidental jollities. Now, you see, I was in Jake's saloon the other day, after a high old row with father, and just as I was going to drink a glass of beer, in walks Asa Churchill,- he saw me- from the door, as he was passing, - and says he, 'Alf, my boy, don't touch that."     \ "And what did you do?" said Helen, softly. "What did I do? I dashed the cursed stuff to the ground -tumbler and all.- What else could I do? When a fellow looks at-you as he did, and you can see his earn- est friendship in his eyes, and he puts his hand on your shoulder and twists you out of a dirty place, where you know you ought n't to be --why, confound it., you -are bound to follow him," exclaimed Alfred, impetuously, as if he wondered at her question. Helen shuddered. Here was her beardless brother, a mere youth, talking of beer and dice, and saloons, and the ready oath on his lips, like a dissolute man of the world hardened by half a lifetime of unrestricted immo- rality. She fell on her knees beside- him, and begged in a tone of prayerful entreaty that he would abandon the profligate course he had entered upon, that he would trust in and be influenced by her in a matter that so deeply concerned his own and her happiness. "Promise me, Alfred, that you will never again vn- ture near those dreadful places, where onily sin and tep-   164      HELEN ETHNGER. tation abound to lure the young and thoughtless to swift destruction. You must see the danger; avoid it; oh, do! Alfred, if you have one grain of love for me, for mother, shun all these falsely-glittering evils. We never had a childhood, and grew up as we might; but I was born to bear what you stumble under, and whatever may await your future, remember there is no fault, or crime even, that I cannot forgive. Therefore do not fear to trust me in any trouble, self-created or otherwise, that may over- take your life. Looking back through the years. that shall pass to this sad night, and recalling your cheerless, misguided, and darkened boyhood, I say I can forgive all and every fault, my brother, and stand your friend and sister, let the transgression be what it may," her pure and now almost inspired face lifted to him beseechingly; and a light shone in the soulful eyes tenderer than any he had ever seen in the blue orbs of Hattie, dearly as she loved him. Alfred was touched, and laid his hand in a fond, con- fiding way on her brown hair, and a caress from him was new to her. "I hope I may never commit a crime, Helen -not so bad as that. Some tall old- scrapes, perhaps; but it is something to know that so long as my sister Helen lives, I have one steadfast friend in the world. I believe, at a pinch, if you were called upon to come out boldly for me, right or wrong, you would not hesitate to defend me against them all."           I "I would endeavor to do my duty," she r plied; - nd at the moment a cautious tap on the door brought her in haste to open it. It was Mrs. Ethinger. Both Helen and Alfred knew the tap,:and who it' w*as that sought admit- tance. "He has not had any supper, poor boy!" -Ia  dry sob  ,   HELEN ETHNGER.         165 came with the hurried whisper -"just a cup of tea, and something he will like." Mrs. Ethinger hastily thrust the tray into the hands of her daughter, and no doubt the movement was accelerated by the sharp voice of Luke calling to her from below. "Emily! Emily!" It came up the stairs like a shot, and was again repeated more loudly than before. "Emily! Emily!" "Yes, Luke; I'm coming!" and she precipitately closed the door, and made all celerity back to her hus- band. The mother well knew where- Helen was when she so suddenly disappeared after her father's return home; and it was not the first time that Mrs. Ethinger had secretly brought the boy, sent supperless to bed, "just a cup of tea, and something he will like." "Where have you been?" questioned Luke, authorita- tively, looking at his wife with undisguised suspicion. "Getting the flour for the yeast," said Emily, speaking in part the truth, and dusting the flour from her hands by way of proving her words. Mr. Ethinger strongly suspected she had been condoling with Alfred, and hence his severity; but the convincing flour quite allayed his distrust, and Emily was allowed to retire to the kitchen and stir up her " sponge " in peace. Helen quickly carried the tray over to her brother and placed it invitingly on the window-ledge within easy reach. "See, mother has brought you some supper -,a nice cup of tea, biscuit, and strawherry preserves; you know you like strawherry sweetmeats, Alf," she said, playfully enume- rating the contents of-the tray, which were rendered a trifle obscure on account of the scarcity of light. Alfred, despite his wrongs and threats of vengeance, had a boy's puissant appetite -for amuggled sweets, and   166      HELEN ETHNGER. could not withstand the savory temptation of the straw- berry preserves, especially as they were offered as a pana- cea to soothe his present ills and restore him in part to reasonable tranquillity. "Father can't beat your strategy in the commissary line, anyhow. When he sends "me to bed without my supper, I always find- extra supplies in that cupboard," pointing to a little closet something like an oldrfashioned Dutch oven. "Hattie avails herself of it, too [ and when we both happen to be in disgrace at the same time, which is very frequently the case, we equally divide and amicably share our prison and our rations with each other." He laughed; but it was rather a satirical attempt at mirth, although he ate his biscuit with evidentrelish, and the sweetmeats vanished with incredible rapidity. He seemed in so much better spirits, that Helen left him quite relieved as to his doing anything desperate, and her fears lulled into the hope that to-morrow would be as yesterday, and with the morning Alfred would forget his threats, or at least there would be no serious 'danger of his acting upon them.. Thus persuaded, she kissed him, and said '"good-night," in her kind, calm fashion, and from that hour Alfred began to rightly know and prize the quiet, all-forgiving love of his good and gifted sister Helen. He was finding the deep, pure depths of that noble heart, and feeling something of its grand courage and faith. Hattie was a sound sleeper, and Helen paused on her way to her own apartment to peep into the room where she lay slumbering as peacefully as a baby, and with never a care at her young heart, as Helen thought. Ah, Helen, if your breast found its lord so soon, why think you this fair sister might not do the same? But will she exercise your discretion, your self-denial, and patience?   HELEN ETHNGER.         167 Assuredly the answer must be "No," for is not the light- ness of her happy nature written on every feature of that lovely sleeping face. Helen stood and looked at the beautiful creature many minutes in a solemn sort of loving pity; so faintly fair the sculptured outline of brow and throat, so soft the curling waves of gplden hair in which the-starlight tangled its brightest rays, and so rich a crimson the dewy blossom of her perfect mouth. Well might Helen tremble to contemplate the dainty beauty of this careless, gay-hearted girl of sixteen. "Hattie will play a joke on the old man some day, if I am not mistaken." Helen remembered that baleful remark of her brother, and felt that she saw in this young, vivacious, and withal heed- less and wilful sister, another powerful reason why she must say to Asa Churchill, unmoved by his passionate pleadings, and against the tenderest dictates of her heart: "I cannot be your wife; my duty lies elsewhere." CHAPTER XIV. ALFRED MAKES GOOD HS THREAT. O alarming outhreak occurred between Alfred and L- his father for a month, but it was a doubtful peace, that a breath might arouse into a fierce war of temper, more fatal in its result than any that had preceded it. Alfred pointedly avoided speaking to or meeting him, and this condition of affairs was not long to be borne by Mr. Ethinger unquestioned. It was now July, and the first week of Helen's vaca-   HELEN  ETHNGER.  tion. The little oasis of rest in the toilsome round of her daily life that she could call her own, exempt from the dull routine of district-school teaching. Good judges were pleased to say that Miss Ethinger painted very cred- itable pictures -for a woman; and that she had ant x- cellent eye for happy situations and coloring. Be that as it may, two of her landscapes had taken the prize at the last county fair, whither she had anonymously sent them, that she might the better attest their real artistic worth. All her leisure time was passed in her room up- stairs, which she [had fitted up, so far as her slender means would allow, into a sort of studio, and here Helen dreamed away her happiest moments. If she only had proper facilities for disposing of her pictures, painting might be more profitable than teaching; but rustic villagers are not apt to be any great admirers of art. Sturdy farmers are not very reliable connoisseurs in such matters, and their criticism on a Murillo would probably have been "a mnere trashy daub." But fortunately, in her need, Helen found a friend will- ing and able to assist her. This was Mr. Alfair, who kept the single bookstore the village of Bergen boasted, and to him in her dilemlma Helen went for aid and ad- vice. He had known her ever since she was a little girl, and used to stand on- tip-toe and gaze in at his show-win- dow to see the flaming prints she thought so marvellously beautiful in those days. He knew she was a born genius: he saw it long ago in the full, reaching look of the child's large, tender brown eyes, so different from that of the other Ethingers; and when she came to him for help, he was justly proud of the confidence, and eager to aid her all in his power. Mr. Alfair knew of picture-dealers in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, and he was confi- dent that some of them must recognize the genuine merit   HELEN ETHNGER.   169   of Miss Ethinger's pencil. He would send one of her best works under cover of his name, and she might rely on his silence. Accordingly, after. careful consideration of the subject, he decided that the first venture should be made with a wealthy Philadelphia firm with whom he had small dealings --a few engravings and chromos from time to time, proportioned to his limited trade; and he felt assured they would at least give the young artist the benefit of a candid criticism. On the bare hope of a possible success, Helen had ar- ranged several important plans in her own mind. The one mainly occupying her thoughts being the generous reflection that she could relinquish the school next sum- mer in favor of her sister. Hattie would be seventeen then, and must do something towards supporting herself, as Helen had been obliged to do at that age. Hattie had been especially educated with a view to teaching; but Helen could not bear to see her go away from home to commence the monotonous drudgery of a country-school teacher among strangers. Heedless little Hattie; so young and handsome and blithe-hearted, to go away from mother and sisters, and be exposed to the alluring snares of the world, with no loving eye to watch and guard against the many dangers and temptations besetting her path. Why, it was cruel to think of; and, strong in the resolve that her beautiful sister should not be compelled to the dreaded extremity of leaving her home in order to earn her living, Helen began to paint the picture which she secretly prayed might meet the purchasing approba- tion of the Philadelphia firm - Tinsley, Baxter & Co. - in ,whose fair judgment Mr. Alfair expressed such un- bounded confidence. "Not Happy."  That is what Helen called the piece which she prayerfully endeavored to make the founda- 15 1-70     HELEN ETHNGERe tion of her future success; and truly her whole heart was in the work. The scene represented a long, low chamber, gloomy with the silence and shadows of midnight.  A lamp burned dimly on an old-fashioned stand in one corner, and in the centre of the room, seated in a high-backed : splint chair, was a woman with a sleeping babe across her knees, and her face covered by her hands. Three chil- dren were slumbering in the room, unconscious of the sor- rowful, watcher; and another, a slight, brown-haired little girl, had crept unseen from the low white bed, and stood irresolute and anxious on the floor, attentively gazing at the- sobbing mother, and an intense love and pity trans- figuring her grave, unchild-like face. It was the bare,' i cheerless nursery of her childhood. The two little girls -I nestled in each other's arms were her sisters, and the boy, sleeping so far away from his tumblied pillow, was her brother. It was herself standing solemn and sleepless in her white night-dress, a world of unuttered sympathy in her eyes, and eager, yet reluctant feet that hesitated to interrupt such deep and lonely sadness. Helen could never forget that desolate night; and here she was, years afterwards, painting it to the life, and every detail as clear in her memory as if it happened but yesterday. She kept her work jealously guarded from every eye; not even Hattie daring to intrude on the hour Helen de-q voted to her artistic pursuits, and assiduously labored towards its completion with unflagging faith and energy. But she was unexpectedly interrupted in her task by a miserable calamity,- a family grief and regret that for a time threatened to quite break poor Mrs. Ethinger's heart, and left Helen a prey to untold anguish of mind, if not entire prostration of body. ] r. thinger, naw keenly alive to the fact that Alfred's ** ,  *  * '  * * .?! '   HELEN ETHINGER.         171 marked silence, while in his presence, was persistent and unbearable insolence, uttered several ominous remarks about "making him find his tongue very soon, and-put an end to his sulks; " which, together with\lfred's in- creasing coldness towards his father, kept Helen in a con- tinual state of alarm. She knew full well the ungovern- able temper of both, as did her mother, whose troubled eyes often looked from husband to son in illy-concealed terror. At last the dread thunder-bolt fell, and Luke Ethinger was made to feel the direful weight of the fierce parricidal anger he had himself engendered, and the aw- ful retaliation he had so long provoked. Alfred was not hoine to tea, a circumstance quite com- mdn of late. Mr. REhinger noticed his absence by saying, "It was the third time the same thing had occurred within the week, but guessed it was the last, if he had any authority in the business,' and he frowned very darkly when he said it. Nine o'clock; still he did not come. Ten; yet he had not returned. Luke's frown became an ugly scowl, and the wrinkle between his eyes seemed to grow each moment deeper, and his face implacable as a stone. His wife and daughters knew his mood to be relentless; his son would feel it so. Mrs. Ethinger glanced apprehensively at Helen, and slyly put another stick of wood in the stove to keep the tea hot. Alfred should have a nice, warm cup of tea after the conflict. She -would insure him that, anyway. Ah, gentle mother; she little thought she was to lose her boy that night! None but Helen anticipated the terrible sequel of the coming conflict. May and Bell yawned sleepily and went to bed, and so did Hattie, feel- ing very uneasy about Alf; of course, but very drowsy also, and consoled by the hopeful supposition that "he   172      HELEN ET-HNGER. would get out of it 'somehow." The old kitchen-clock chimed forth the half-hour. Half-past ten, m Mr. Ethinger strode off up-stairs, his brow black as night; and they heard him tramping vengefully overhead, nursing his wrath against the time of his son's arrival. Helen went cautiously to the door, and looked wistfully out into the hazy darkness. "Do you see anything of him?" whispered Mrs. Eth- inger, anxiously. "No, mother; not even a sound." "My poor, unfortunate boy!" she sighed the tramp overhead jarring heavily on her maternal heart. Then she sat down pitiably pale and still fearing, she hardly knew what, and shiveringly counting the dull tick, tick of the old clock. The dense foliage of ,the great gnarled cherry-trees shrouded the little path to the gate in fitful gloom, making the, nearest objects undistinguishable from the-, surrounding shadows; but beyond their sombre tops the moonlightI lay clear and effulgent on the quiet hills, and slept peacefully in the valley. Helen took her hat and shawl from the rack in the hall, and slowly walked out to the gate. The leaves flickered mournfully in the slight breeze, and she bent her ear to listen, but only their soft sighing rustle was in the air. She opened the gate and went on into the road. The moist dust of the wayside gave no echo to her light footsteps, and she was scarcely aware of how far she was going. Myriads of fireflies darted in and out the wet grass and high up among-the trees, the tiniest and most perfect and wonder- ful-pyrotechnists in all creation, and she lost herself in listlessly following their glowing track. She paused on the brow of the little hill,-the spot associated with so much that was sad in her young life; and again scanned ti u ,   HELEN ETHNGER-.         173 the lonesome road, hoping to catch a glimpse of her brother in the dusky distance. But the hope was vain. The  road was utterly desolate as far as her strained vision could penetrate the misty moonlight. The village lay wrapped in night's brooding silence; now and then a straggling glimmer, visible through some close-curtained window, telling where some anxious watcher kept untir- ing vigil while others slumbered. Above cottage and mansion, the solemn church-spires pointed mutely towards ' the vast azure sky, studded with its millions of stars and the mellow splendor of a cloudless full moon. The plain- tive, irregular chirp of innumerable night-insects chant- ing discordantly in the grass, and the near whir of the dusk-brown wings of a startled whippoorwill were hea'rd and seen by Helen as we hear and see things in a half- wakeful dream. Yet she was not insensible to the calm beauty surrounding her at that lonely and strangely im. pressive hour. The ripening harvest fields; the deep un- broken green of the meadow; the soft rustle of the young corn in the lot over the fence, made it like a great lovely picture to her, painted by the mighty Master-hand, who, at a command, summoned a world into existence, and set the planetary creation within the blue mystery of the heavens. But she turned from  it all with a weary sigh. It was to) vast for her comprehension; too sublime for her mor- tal conception.  For the third time her longing gaze ' swept the obscure road, peering down its dim length with the same look of anxious unrest in her eyes. A thrill of sudden relief stirred her heart when she descried the ob- ject of her disquiet leisurely approaching from the oppo- site direction. Alfred did not appear to be in the least hurry, and was softly whistling to himself some melodious little airfHelea lo"          , ^   174      HELEN ETH1NGER, had often heard him whistle in that low musical way when he thought himself alone. Seemingly, he was quite at his ease and in a very happy frame of mind. So he continued his pleasantly resonant tune as he sauntered along, altogether unconscious of the girlish figure stand- ing motionless in the solid shade of the stone wall, with her eyes fixed upon him in almost an agony of love and fear. He stopped abruptly on seeing his sister, exhibiting a little surprise, and said, with a light laugh: "' What, Helen, did you come to beau me home?" "Oh, Alfred, I tremble for you," she replied, in a voice tremulous with emotion. "I Don't be alarmed. I am able to take care of myself, as you shall see. No sneaking to-night; I am going to walk right in, and take the consequences." And the leonine courage depicted in his face proved that he firmly meant what he said. "Please, Alfred, do not be rash," she implored, laying her band on his arm. "Why did you stay so late? How could you, when- you knew how it would be at home?" a"I suppose you are trying to hint that the old man is ripe for a row of the blood-and-thunder sort, and kindly awaiting my arrival to begin the performance." 'Father is in a terrible passion. I never saw him more angry, Don't brave him to-night; don't, Alfred, forGod's sake!" entreated poor Helen, clinging to him, and doiig her little all to hold him back, and soften the woful: purpose she saw reflected in his flashing eyes. But the boy was hard as iron, and would not heed her gentle OQ,.sele "Passion or not, I am going to face the music at all 'eweT tai I am going in peaceably, and up to bed, if he -wil t et; 'if not, then I ame pot nswerable for what ;W follow, ^  * , .  -, ^ * ^  -'-Jo    HELEN ETHNGER .        175 "But you will not be hasty, Alfred. Think of us, and restrain your anger, whatever father may do or say." "You are asking too much, Helen; but have no fears., I intend, to keep as cool as a soda fountain, come what will, for I cannot afford to let my temper get the best of me to-night. And now don't you get white and cold as a ghost; there is really nothing to be frightened about. I mean only to defend my rights; and I an rgoing to do itO-     and openly, square up to the mark, and take my chance, with the odds against me." The hand resting, small and fair, on his sturdy arm, shook like an aspen, and its light, trembling weight some- how touched his impulsive heart, for he looked down at it tenderly, and said, half seriously, half playfully: "A good, kind, little hand, Helen. God bless it! I never in all my life knew it to do a single act that- was other than gentle and helping." He gathered up the soft, slender fingers in his own rugged grasp, idly caress- ing them as she walked along by his side; and Helen re- membered that fondling, boyish clasp when her brother's sins were many - remembered, forgave, and loved him, when Alfred Ethinger had need of a sister's love and forgiveness. The determined look of his face, with that strange smile coming and going, the rapid change from frown to laugh, and the steely glitter of his restless-eyes, filled Helen with distrust; and every step onward was one of vague fear and increasing anxiety. But Alfred did not once falter. Evidently he had made up his mind to throw off the galling yoke of-his father's authority, and yield, him no further filial respect- rifbe- dience. It had come to that,- as ahe long agqos-d it Would,-and- he was ready for anything despe:re an irrevocable. Ndot a muscle moved, or a pulse beat ti: !    176      HELEN ETHNGER. quicker, as he opened the gate-,but his sister saw his face change to marble-like firmness, and the sight sent a sud- den weakness through all her limbs, and her sinking heart said, 'It has come!" fAt the hall-door she stopped, held him back, and ap- pealed once more to the boy's better self. "Oh, be forbearing, Alfred! -Do, I implore H for mother's sake. Don't break her heart, and mine, this night. Right or wrong, he is our father; and heaven pity you, if you should forget it!'" "Fatherr!" he repeated contemptuously, as if he hated the very sound of the name. "I never had a father; and I mean to deal with Luke Ethinger to-night as he has always dealt with me. Buit there will be no trouble, unless he makes it; and then-  Let me go, Helen! Neither angels nor devils can stop me now!" He broke away fromn her detaining hands, freeing him- self almost roughly; and the noise he made opening the inner door, drowned the low miserable moan that escaped her pale lips. Alfred passed on into the sitting-room, leaving his sister shivering- terrified in the hall, and quietly walked up stairs as ,unconcernedly as if nothing. had happened, or , was to happen that dreadful night. When Mrs. Ethinger noticed the careless'step and com- posed manner of her son, she instinctively fled, knowing : full well its wretched significance; but half-way up the stairs, she paused, -grasping the, balustrade for support, turned back her ashen face, anid faintly articulated- each word-mufiled in a dry, affrighted sob: "Alfred, my son, mother can't-" '"Hold your tongue, Em'ly!" - thundered her husband, harshy -cutting- short the timid, motherly plea, and dead to. her chokingcrJ of anguish. Having silenced his wife, he turned: on his son, and savagely demanded;   HELEN ETHNGER,         1" '.'Well, young man, where have you been until this time of night?" "To the village, sir," coolly replied Alfred, without looking at his enraged father, and going on as if no further explanation were necessary. But the words were barely uttered before a rude hand seized his collar, and Luke fairly hissed:      ( "Stop, you scoundrel You will soon discover that you can't go to the village and play the loafer whenever you like. I have had enough of your d--d insolence and villany; now I am going to thrash it out of you. Take off your coat." Instead of obeying, Alfred jerked himself clear of his father's grasp, and turned around-on him hotly. "Don't touch me! If you lay a hand on me to-night, by heaven, it is at your peril! Stand off, sir, and let me pass." - "What, you, you dare -- " "Yes, I dare anything. I am no longer a child, and it is time you knew it. I dare say to your face and main- tain, Luke Ethinger, that from this moment I openly dis- regard and defy you, and you are welcome to do your worst. Yet take heed, for if you attempt the old game, you will find me dangerous. So again I say, let me pass." The lithe, active figure drew up in a defensive attitude, and, the determined eyes looked straight at the fierce old man, without a tremor of fear or a gleam of lingering affection. Indeed, the boy-spoke the truth. He wasdan- gerous, and saw not his father, but a remorseless enemy in the passion-distorted features of Luke Ethinger. They faced each other a moment in appalling silence, --Alfred calm, resolute, and wary; Mr. Ethinger con- founded, and livid with rage. He had not-expected re-   178      HELEN ETHNGER. sistance, and was completely taken off his guard. But he speedily rallid his astonished faculties, and only one way occurred to him whereby he could hope to master this un- holy rebellion, and crush it at the onset. And this way he did not-hesitate to pursue, it was so directly in unison with his lifelong precepts. Not deigning a reply, he de- liberately drew back his clenched hand, and a furious blow, dealt with all the superhuman strength of extreme passion, sent Ithe boy- headlong to the floor. Alfred quickly regained his feet, and with the -spring of an in- furiated tiger threw himself upon his father. Then began ,a frightful struggle over which the angels must have wept. Luke Ethinger had sown the wind, and now he was reaping the whirlwind. In pity we drop the veil, and ; leave the sin to God's impartial judgment. it The loud shuffle of uncertainly moving feet, the mut- tered oath, and hard breathing of frenzied rage forced a wild cry of terror and despair :from the miserable wife and mother. Life seemed to desert her with the 'one piteous call. "Stay your hand, Alfred; in mercy stop!" and she sank pallid and cowering to her knees, happily bereft ofsense and feeling. -May and Bell, in the adjoining room, heard the noise, -and, half awake, rubbed their eyes in a sleepy effort to find out what it meant, "Oh; I kno*w," says May, after listening a second. "It 's papa scolding Alf. I wish he would n't; and wake me, up and get me seared," and with that, having, a pro- found sense of the divine law of self-preservation from past experience, she left Alf to his fate. Then they snuggled their dear little heads close together, drew the quilts over them to shut out the unpleasant sound, and in ju$stwo minutes were fast asleep agqin. ::::elen, still in the hall below, sawa;nothing of the fierce   M HELEN ETHNGER.             179, combat going on above, but she heard enough to chill her very heart's blood. By a mighty effort she kept herself from fainting, clasped her cold hands, and tried to pray. "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." It was all her blanched lips could utter in - that hour of unspeakable suffering. - The tumult at its height aroused Hattie, and she sprang bewildered from her bed, and rushed out on the landing. -She stopped midway in the passage, looking around in wild-eyed consternation and terror. Slender and statue- like in her white night-dress, and her amber-gold hair tossed about her colorless face in a mass of silky, disordered curls, she seemed like some heaven-sent spirit come to still the mad strife and restore peace to the frantic house- hold. "Alfred, Alfred, what are you doing?" she cried, lift- ing her hands towards him in a supplicating manner. "Desist in God's name, you two disgraceful objects of a- father and brother, before you kill us all!" Alfred relaxed his hold. There- was the sound of a heavy fall, as if Luke Ethinger had tumbled down-stairs. Alfred leaped over the prostrate form of his father,-his face crimson from anger, excitement, and the terrific ex- ertion of the encounter,-seized his hat, and darted through the sitting-room into the outer hall. He came full upon Helen, crouching alone in the dark, as if afraid of her own shadow; and for the first time his deplorable cour- age broke. She knew it by the quiver of his voice, and the poor excuse he tried to offer.   "He would have it, and he has got it. I only de- fended myself.. Don't hate me. I 'm off. Say good-bye : to mother and the girls for me."         - "Oh, Alfred! pray God to forgive yout may He for- give us all!" She threw. her armt about him in a- last embrace, and then she was her quiet, earnest self.   1-80     HELEN ETHNGER-. 4 t Yes, you must go, Alfred. After to-night this is no place for you. Heaven direct and keep you; and let there never be a blacker sin upon your soul than this. Promise me that you will lead a worthy life; be a man, and atone this wicked act. Live it down; rise above it; and in either trouble or want, don't forget you have a sister Helen." What a change! The girl, but the instant before wan as ashes, was now composed and ready to aid her outcast brother. A "I will be a man, Helen. I 'll think of you when tempted, and live worthy of my sister," he burst out, ve- hementl.       '  : "Ad you' will give me your honest, sacred word of that?" "As heaven. sees me, my most sacred word." "I willaccept it, and believeanyou against the world." d She thrust a crisp bit of paper into his hand, and whis- pered: "There, take that, and God bless you!"It was a: new twenty-dollar note-all the money she had; but she felt so thankful that she had even that much to give him. By this time they were out in the paling moonlight; and he said, rather sorrowfully: "He made me what I am. It is you who make me what I will be. It's a rough business anyhow; and I wish-I wish --but never mind; think the best of me, and -- and good-bye." She"s,* a blood-red spot on his forehead,- a purple and swoilen contusion, with the crimson stain in the cen- tre, oozing warm across his brow; and on his flushed cheeks tears were glistening :like rain-drops. Hapless boyl he was paying for his temerity already. -So-Heien saw her brother last with tears and blood   HELEN   ETHNGER*      181 upon his face; and the sight made it very easy for her to forgive him. Alfred vaulted over the gate at a bound, looked back to where she stood in the feeble moonlight, and briskly walked away in the direction of the village, homeless and friendless, to try the world unaided and alone. Helen turned and entered the ouse. grave and tearless as a sculptured thing carved in thy semblance of a woman. a Luke recovered his feet after a little--nobody daring to help him - and was raving like a madman when she appeared. He was actually delirious with passion, and muttered imprecations long and deep on the head of the fleeing rebel;   .  "Where is the villain.? let me lay hold'of him, and I 'll pound. him within an inch of his life! I say, where is he.?" "Gone," said Helen, quietly. "Gone?" "Yes; and he will not return. It will take him ut a few minutes to reach the village; and I think the mid- night train will bear him away from Bergen forever." "Well, I am glad of it. If he ever darkens the door again, I 'll kick him into the street," fumed the old man. "Have no fear; we shall not soon again see Alfred Ethinger." "Eh? what's that? not see him again?" Mr. Ethinger rubbed his-smarting nose, and was just a little staggered. His surprise was merely momentary, however, and he immediately caught at the tappy thought. "But the beggar has no money, and he can't go far without that."  "Perhaps not," said Helen ambiguously, going to the assistance of her mother, who looked the imge of death. This turned his rage on everybody, irrespective of rele- 16   182      HELEN ETHNGER o          j vancy:; and he accused his wife of fostering Alfred's' shameless inpertinence, of setting him up to it," charged Helen with taking sides against him, and conniving at her brothers ill-doing, and peremptorily ordered Hattie back to bed, declaring she -was no better than Alfred, but she'd fEnd him master yet a while. Hattie curled her pale lips disdainfully, and made no motion to obey. Privately, she did not blame Alf a bit; and she had some difficulty in hiding her satisfaction. Slightly stiff and sore, and getting more so every mo- ment, Luke finally growled himself into silence, and fum- bled off to bed a little the worse for his violent exercise; and what his dreams were it is hard to tell. The instant he disappeared, the three sorrow-smitten women huddled together, and tried to comfort each other all they could. k Hattie sought consolation in her temper, and said some very sharp things. -:"Iknow it is dreadful wicked of me, but I can't help saying father did not get much more,than he deserved. Why didn't he let him alone, and not sit up until near midnight, just to vent his spite and pick a quarrel with him. I should think he might have seen that Alf would n't always stand it. I believe the duty of a child has limits, and that we are not bound to bear every- thing." Oh, my poor, poor boy " sobbed Mrs. Ethinger, un- heeding Hattie's sharp argtnent, and wringing her hands helplessly one over the other. All of a sudden she started up and reached out her arms, as if she would snatchi her child back to her breast. The girls under- stood the gesture and the cause, for the shrill whistle of the deplarting train echoed dismally through the still midnight, and each felt that Alfred- was leaving them, perhaps, Bfrever.   ' HELEN  ETHNGER.      183 ( Oh, it is taking away my boy - my one poor, wretched son," wailed the agonized mother. "Don't let him leave me so; call him back, Helen; I can't let him go. I can- not, I cannot part with him." "^He is in the hands of God," said Helen, solemnly; her manner strangely subdued, and a stilling hush in her voice that was singularly sweet and controlling. "Let us trust that- this sad calamity may result in good. I have faith and patience to believe it so, and hopefully await the end."            ' "Ah, my daughter, your clear eyes see far better than mine. We will ask God to watch over the young wan- derer." And the three knelt down and softly prayed for the exiled I son and brother, the miserable; homeless Al- fred, who had fled none knew whither. What Luke's reflections were, it is impossible to conjec- ture; but very early the following morning he went glumly to the village, and was flippantly informed- by the .ticket-agent that a lad answering to the description  of Alfred Ethinger had left on the 11.55 train; a-nd- jocosely added that he did not buy a ticket, just jumped aboard, and guessed he went through, since he had not heard of a boy being put off the 11.55 express, Mr. Ethinger came home, making no further inquiry, and curtly told his family that he never wanted to hear "that fellow's" name mentioned again under his roof. He disowned,and cursed him, consigned him uncondi- tionally to Satan, and gave him five years to bring up in the State prison. The neighbors talked about -it for a week; some sagely averring that they " knew how it would be," others piously trusted that it would be a lesson to Luke Ethinger, although Alfred was undoubtedly a bad boy. His flight did not surprise them: it was merely a question of time.   HELEN ETHNGER. May and little Anabel had their cry the next day, and tearfully wondered what brother Alf did to father that made that crusty old gentleman limp, and wear a black patch on his nose for two days afterwards. CHAPTER XV. ThlSTLE-BLOOMS. AFTER the first poignant grief was over, the absence of Alfred an unalterable fact, and they could think and act calmly once more, Helen resumed her interrupted work, and tenderly painted his face into her picture, with many' unspoken prayers for his safety. When it was finished, she had her mother and Hattie in to see it. Mrs. Ethinger recognized the portraiture at a glance, and the tears unbidden filled her eyes. "Oh, ydu dear Helen," cried Hattie, ecstatically; "why, this will be famous! When did you ever think of such a subject ? I declare, you are a genius! I can almost hear that poor, unhappy woman sob, and the baby-I 've seen mother hold Bell just that way. Why, Helen, I do believe it is us. And that is you, creeping out of bed, like a ghost, in your night-gown, and May and I sleeping as sound as tops; and poor Alf--I've seen him sleep so often that way, with his head quite off the pillow, his hair tossed all about, and- don't sell this picture, Helen; it is like selling ourselves," and she be- gan to cry; it seemed so cruel, when Alfred was so dear a part of it. ' "I must, Hattie; I want the money," said Helen.   I.   HELEN ETHINGER.   r   185   The younger sister did not know that the roof above her pretty head was mortgaged, and some day, not far distant, she might be homeless  But Helen knew it, for the day Mrs. Ethinger was required, 'in accordance with the law, to sign the necessary legal papers, she had confided the secret to her eldest daughter, and Helen realized that a home once entangled by a mortgage was a home no longer. In due time the picture was given into the care of Mr. Alfair, and by him promptly transmitted to Tinsley, Baxter & Co. She awaited the result in no small anxiety; and it came in the welcome shape of a check good for one hun. dred and fifty dollars, and an order for six paintings of like size, if she was willing to dispose of them at the same rate. Now, she did not tremble for the future. Her highest hopes had not exceeded fifty dollars; and this unexpected- amount quite overjoyed her, while it stimu- lated her to fresh exertions.  Hattie could have the school, and she would paint. That was Helen's favorite arrangement. But Miss Hattie hated school -teaching, and had very different plans of her owfm  The truth is, she was in love,-deeply and inextrickbly in love with Mr. Frank Buel,-and mightily afraid the secret would get out. It was appalling to think of the fibs she told in navely accounting for her walks, which were becoming suspiciously long and frequent. And the simplicity with which she defended her mendacity was equally unique and convincing.. "I am getting quite old-past six- teen," reasoned she. "And if Frank will take my time to walk, I can't help it. I must be civil, and of course I visit his sister. Flo is such a darling; and for him to accompany me home, or most home, is only commonplace, and no more than he ought to do. If I go to churoh,^.he is sure to meet me somewhere on the way; and one must 16      HELEN ETHNGER.  talk. So I tell anything to avoid a direct reply; and it is the easiest method to get out of it." A sophistry alto- gether characteristic of Hattie, who was not one long to carry a "heart bowed down." Frank had cherished a tender regard for her ever since she was in high aprons, and he gallantly drew her to school on his sled; and so, very naturally, whatever Frank said. was law and gospel to her, and what he set her up to do, she did without scruple or a doubt of his affection. She was a little vain and vindictive with it all, and impatiently abided the time when Mrs. Frank Buel might safely speak her mind, as Miss Hattie Eth- inger never dared to do. No one dreamed of her attach- ment; they looked upon her simply as a child, and Frank was already a stirring business man, whom they did not suspect of being particularly fond of his quondam school- mate. It was the last day of the term, and Helen was to leave the old school-room, where she had taught for two sea- sons, never to assume its duties again. She had kissed all her pupils good-bye, and stood on the door-stone watching the children scatter in every direction across the green. The boys waved their hats and shouted lustily; the girls cried and smiled; and a few ran back "just to kiss dear Miss Helen once more." Little Winny Church- ill sobbed outright, and vowed she would never go to school another day, for no teacher would-love her like Miss Ethinger, and always be gentle with her. But they were all gone at last, and Helen stood alone on the door- step. *She locked: the door, and slowly started homewards. It was not late -only four o'clock of a. September after- noon. The cradled oats lay in long golden swaths, and the tired harvesters yet bent to their toil, as she had seen themtoiling in the early morning. The russet leaves of   ii   HELEN ETHINGER.   187   the ripe corn gave forth a pleasant sound, like summer waves playing on a sandy shore; and the beautiful har- mony of earth and man seemed to her very soothing and complete. She stopped on the summit of the little hill, and her eyes wandered thoughtfully over the far-reaching landscape. What a pity there should- be sin and sorrow and separation in the world, when it was so lovely and might be so peaceful. What a glorious thing a Septem- ber afternoon is, if you can possess it in the country alone. The purple and white blossoms of the Canada thistles, growing rankly by the roadside, take to themselves a n(w beauty, and nod to the weight of the riotous bees, who industriously powder their nimble legs in the very heart of the feathery buds; and the thistle not once complains. So they were doing to-day; and insects floated by'on dreamy wings, and the cows in the pasture-lot, weary of feeding, lay resting in the shade, or stood knee-deep in the brook, lazily winking their great mild eyes against the troublesome encroachments of the gnats. When the ripe corn was green, and the thistles not so tall as now, Helen had met Alfred here; and here, too, she had shrined a thought of Asa. The spot was peculiarly dear to her, and she passed her hand absently over the downy- thistle- blooms, not thinking of their power to wound, but won- dering if all her life were to be thus solitary. Most girls ask themselves the question at her age; Helen's was an- swered rather curiously. A voice on the other side of the wall said: "I knew you would stop on the hill, Helen," and Asa Churchill speedily made himself visible by jumping over the wall and offering his hand. She was not a woman to affect surprise, and merely 'gave him her hand with a simple "Good-afternoon, Asa; you always appear when least expected."    188      HELEN ETHNGER. "But none the less welcome, I hope." "You are never unwelcome, Asas," she smiled, and shyly drew her hand from his, looking anywhere but at him. But Asa was not to be put off. He had waited for this day and hour, and- now he meant to improve it. So he said, very earnest and straightforward, like a man who knew exactly what he- was saying, and- thoroughly under- stood the wish of his heart: "Helen, I have known and loved you all my life; are you ready to leave all others for me, and be my wife?" "Asa, H-" her hand left the thistles and fluttered up to her heart. "No, I cannot. I told you so before, Asa."         r "Then -you do not love me, Helen, and never did." "Yes, I do; and always will; but I cannot leave those who depend upon me in many ways. ,My father is old, his affairs embarrassed, and my mother--I can't leave her, Asa." "You owe nothing to your father," he replied, coldly. "That may be; but he is none the less my father. Set- ting his claims on my duty aside, how can I desert my mother in her grief: think of my young sister, think of my outcast brother, and say from your heart, Asa, that I can do it."           ' "If you loved me rightly, you would not put the claims of any one before me." "If .I loved you less, you mean. Oh, Asa, you know me better than that. I stay with them because they are weak and you are strong. You will go steadily on in the path of right without me, and will hardly miss the poor love I .am not ashamed to say I have for you."  'I shall always dearly love you, Helen; but I must have my answer, yes or no, to-day,"-- manlike he took uin-   HELEN ETHNGER.         189 brage at her steadfast devotion to others, and manlike he resented it.  "Yes, you must decide to-day--now. I am going away." "Going. away!" she echoed, every vestige of color for- saking her face. "Unless you bid me stay. I have a good position of- fered me in the office of a distinguished Philadelphia lawyer, and, if you refuse me, I shall accept it. I can't believe it right that you should sacrifice your youth and happiness in ministering to the age and weaknesses of those who may never thank you for it. It is my happi- ness you are blighting; my love you are slighting; my care and whole life's single affection you are throwing away. Oh, Helen, Helen, have some little pity on me, for, without you, I can never be happy i" For an instant she wavered. His brave warm heart was at her feet. With his love he offered-her luxury, ease, and a name he had the ability to make famous; on the other hand there was poverty, toil, subjection, and loneliness. She would be Asa Churchill's loved and honored wife- but no, like a reproach came the memory of her words: "I will never leave you, mother." She hesitated no longer, and said meekly, like a child sorry for a fault: "'then you will have to leave me, Asa." His lips shut tightly, and he looked straight at her in a stern, disappointed way, as men look when their dearest wish has been denied and their honest love refused. "Very well, Miss Ethinger." How cruel a kind man can be sometimes. Asa did not know how deeply that cold reply hurt the girl he pro- fessed to adore. 4',   90      HEILEN ETHNGE:R. "But not so, Asa; you must not leave me so. I could not bear it.' -  The ge ntle eyes lifted confidingly to his face--the large soleman eyes, with their far-down-patient depths that always brought her close to his heart, be stern as he would; so what could he do, after being so unreasonably severe, but open his --arms and say, "Helen, forgive me," -hich proper thing he did; and she crept into his arms and laid her head softly on his breast, and whispered: - "Don't go thinkingihard of me, for you take my little all of sunshine with^ you, and I will be utterly, utterly desolate."  - He smoothed her- satin-brown hair, and felt himself a Gbra and a scoundrel, ind I don't -know what else, to treat bef as, Anyway, he repented his harshness, and pleaded, with his lips upon her forehead: ' ,':Helen, darling, forgive my faults;- rememler only my love; and here, in your rightful -place on myl breast, say you will never forsake it.

You are my ideal of a pure and nobloe woman, and I'll live true to it.

HELEN ETHNGEB. 1-91 And now, good-bye." One tender farewell kiss, and she was alone. Alone by the roadside, and the brightness of- the September afternoon had fled. The sun faded from the hills, and stole away from the tree-tops. : The cows went lowing homewards, and the tired harvesters left the field. The cradled grain lay golden in the swath, the bees abandoned the blossoms, and the thistle-blooms were gemmed with dew. Helen stood solitary in the midst, clasped her nerveless hands, and murmured: "This is the heaviest burden of all. Dear Lord, give me strength to bear it l" The shrill call of a whippoorwill resounded from the adjacent wood, and startled her into a consciousness -that it'was getting dark. It came, skimming the earth in -its low flight, and alighted on the fence just ahead of- her,. The white spots on its wings quickly folded out-of sight, and it began the doleful plaint, ' Whip-poor-will I whip poor-will-l" as Ishe heard it -the night Alfred- left them. Was it a bird of ill omen? and did-it presage fresh sorrow t t, Whip-poor-will!" The sombre wings unfurled, and-it swervingly flew on again, keeping all the time beforet: her,. Foreboding ill or otherwise, there was no ..gr- sacrifice or disappointment any more in life for HBea: Ethinger. She had fought the battle, and uwonl;and went home a little weary and heart-sick, but satisfied and conscious of having done right. Hattie met her at the gate- in considerable trepidation. "Where on earth have you been? We began to think you were lost. Surely you have not been bidding adieu to that shabby old school-house all the afternoon?" "No. I loitered on the way, and. did not notice it was so late. It was a beautiful sunset." "Oh, in one of your poetic beatitudes, I suppose. Well, you have kept tea waiting an hour, and father would be rossif he knew."   -,   HELEN  ET-HNGER.  Hattie unceremoniously appropriated Helen's passive arm, and together the sisters entered the house. The next day, Miss Hattie carelessly imparted the news that Helen had nerved herself to hear unmoved, although half the village was talking about it, and none were more speculative than Hattie. Said she, with authentic perspicuity: "Asa Churchill left home this morning for Philadel- phia. Alma just told me; and she has almost cried her eyes out on account of it. Don't it seem rather surpris- ing that he should go off so suddenly? Alma says they did not know a word of it until yesterday." "Yes, Helen never expressed much surprise. "I dare say his sister will sadly miss him; indeed, they will sadly miss him." "And at one time I thought somebody else, not imme- diately of the-family, might sadly miss him. Oh, my dear, prim sister, you need not deny it, mischievously aued ghj  tte .  "Yes; I think a great deal of ASa, and I shall sadly miss him," ihe said, looking frankly into her sister's blue eyes. Hattie was puzzled. It was not her way of evad- ing a truth; and she concluded Helen did not care for Asa after all.   HIELEX. ETHINGE1'o   193   CHAPTER XVI. HATTIE DECLINES THE SCHOOL. T UKE ETHINGER had never been the same man since the flight of his son. Formerly he was peevishly fault-finding and irritable; now he was morose and siU lenly reticent. Age, too, was telling on him,- he was sixty-three,-and rheumatism was insidiously twistiig his limbs out of shape. Every joint and muscle held an ache, and for weeks at a time he writhed in the 'itches of rheumatic twinges as relentless as they were torturing. Spring found his business more than ever entngied; and his financial affairs, as well as his health, iii s de-. plorable condition. Helen painted several pictures dring the winter, which were disposed of advanta i usiy; but she had never produced anything  good as her tria pice, "Not Happy."   All her efforts were feeble besite- iM and no one knew this better than herself.  .  It was a miserable, wet April day, and Hattie came in the room where Helen was sitting, looking her wretch edness and feeling very culpable. "Well, Helen, I have done as you requested, and form- ally applied for the school; but I really don't Want it" "Not want it; why, Hattie?" There was a slight accent of reproach in her tone, which the other did not heed. "No, indeed. I am not fitted to teach. I am ;a to be a failure. .I'd scandalize the board df educaio4n, be in disgrace with the trustees, and en raehala hiun- dred doting parents in less than a week. I am sure I should make dirt-pudding with my p     upli::t e: :^   194      HELEN ETHNGER. teaching them those dreadful a b c's. And if they cried over it, poor little wretches, as I used to do, I'd let them skip the multiplication table, and be lenient touching the rules of grammar. Just fancy me 4 stern schoolma'am, with my satchel and my rod, and my dignity. Dignity I oh, gracious! I'd play pussy-in-the-corner, and run foot- races-with the young Arabs-that's what I'd do. It was all well enough for you at my age; but I 'm no sen- Bible, commanding Helen. May is quite as much' suited for the responsibility as I am, and so I tell you plainly ,on the start."  ,Hattie curled herself down in a chair, very unlike a sedate "schoolma'am," and seemed an exceedingly ag- grieved and self-distrustful young lady. Seeing Helen did not reply, and looked very grave, she resumed,-extenuatingly: -  "You know what a careless little piece I am, and how I hate confinement, and the tread-mill momentum of any- thing that is eternally moving in the same old groove. -y,:Id die; I am confident I would. Those old hacked desks-and benches would drive me crazy in a month; and then imagine me saying to those smudgy-faced urchins in a serious manner: 'You Jimmy and Tommy, come and recite your lesson;' imagine me standing Sammy in the corner, boxing Bobby's dirty ear,- and wiping Dicky Jink's; puggy nose, and their aggressive mothers coming three timesa week to quarrel with me; bah, it makes me sick to think of it."   ,       J : Helencould not, hide a smile at Hatties vivid idea of theanoyanes endured by a country school-teacher, and replied, encouragingly:  ",I never found it so disagreeable, Hattie." It- would be to we; and their horrid geography and ele- mtae y aTlthWt iwd their nasaVl' Ple se, ma'am, may.   HELEN ETHNGER.         195 I go out?' and, ' Mother said I could come home at re- cess ;' and 'Can't Sally stop pinchin' me?' Charlie Todd has torn his book, for which mishap I am supposed to slap him; and his brother is whimpering with the stomach-ache, for which I am supposed to have a panacea; and his sister falling asleep over her primer and tumbling off the bench and breaking her head, for'all of which I am held respon- sible, and must bathe the bumps if I would not see her go into fits. And then the moment my back is turned to know they-are all throwing spit-balls and making faces at me, as Alf and I used to do; and I don't presume this generation to be a bit better than we were. Now, how do you suppose I am ever to suffer all this, and live?" The comical expression of her witching face was gravely met by Helen, who endeavored to reconcile her to the school-teaching proposition, and reason her into accept- ance, "It may not be altogether a pleasant alternative to a girl of your capricious nature; but none of us can be idle, and, since you cannot do better, try and be satisfied with it, Hattie." "I might do better," she said, slyly. "In what way, Hattie?" She grew red as a rose, and replied: "Why, I might marry Frank Buel." "Hattie Ethinger, are you out of your senses?" ex- claimed Helen, staring at her sister in unaffected aston- ishment.  "Not at all. Bless me; don't look as if you had seen a spirit! It's a settled thing, all but the time. I 'll confess, if you will keep my secret." -Helen kept oh with her sewing, but her hand trembled a little. She was thinking of her sacrifice. Hattie viewed her silence in the light of a promise, and serenely wentton, ^\   196      HELEN ETHNGE'R. "Frank, you see, is the best fellow in the world; and - well, we have been fond of each other ever so long sever since he divided his Christmas candies with me, and let me ride down hill on his sled; and when I will, I can step from this house into his, and be my own mistress; only I am so young," glancing deprecatingly at her sister, and wishing she would not be quite so still. "Father will never consent." Helen did not lift her eyes; they were fixed on the seam she was stitching, and what they held of wonder, pain, and sadness, Hattie never saw. "I know that very well; because he thinks I 'll be able to teach, and dutifully hand him  over the proceeds. Frank is -not particularly, fond of my pana, and I - no matter, Helen, I sha'n't immolate myself to gratify his selfishness. Count me out, and thlere will se three of you left; and Iam sure he can't expect us all to be old maids. Just consider, four qld maid school-teachers. Contem- plate four spinster 'Miss Ethingers, with diplomas and spectacles, revised editions of- Aunt Becky at fifty," laughed 'the little-beauty, as if she could never be like Aunt Becky. Helen was very thoughtful. "And when and where do you see Mr. Buel?" "Oh, wherever I can -at his sister's, at church, after- noon rambles, moonlight walks." "And that is dangerous, Hattie." - "DaIngerous! it is nothing of the kind: it is downright necessity; for how can we do otherwise, when theie is an old dragon always posted at the gate to keep everything in the form of a handsome young gentleman outside? Now, I like a nice, handsome young gentleman; indeed, there is a certain one of the dear species that I sincerely love, and if my-papa-won't let him come to see me, my papa's daughter will go to see him whenever she can get a chance, and there is my sin in a nut-shell."   HELEN ETHNGERo.          1u Helen dropped her eyes; she thought of the thistles, the chance meetings, the sad farewell, of the love she had never breathed to any living mortal, and thus guilty her-. self, how could she reprove her candid, outspoken sister, who was merrily confessing what she was studiously con- cealing. Hattie, feeling herself to be reprehensible, mistook her sister's silence for censure, and said, apologetically: "If father was like anybody else, and would let us have company like other girls, I would not think of de- ceiving him. I dare not ask Alma Churchill, nor Flor- ence Buel, nor any of the girls to spend an afternoon with me. He would fly into a tantrum, ready to take my head off, if I should do such a thing;' so he leaves me no alter- native but to deceive him. He keeps us caged up here like so many owls; and if we use our wings as soon as we find out their purpose, he ought not to be surprised. I am not like you, Helen; I never did profess to be good; Alf and I always admitted that we were wicked, and I admit it yet. As for the danger you hint, there you are: at sea, for you were never in love; so you can't guess how safe I know I am with Frank." The pretty child said this with a triumphant smile, and the warmest color on her cheek. Helen's face was the hue of marble, but Hattie was not the least discernng. ( You don't know what a deliciously sweet thing, it is to lie awake at night and think how somebody loves you, and how you love sQmebody, and how preciously dear you are to one true heart. T  t: ismleaven, Helen, and all your soul goes out to it gladly, tenderly, trustfully. Ya can laugh then at frowns, and smile when they talk to you of another fate, You just fall in love, and see how beauti ful the change will be,-a new world, a new life will opea t you; and yo I will so worship the dear object in your ' S   198-     HELEN ETHNGER. dreams-love it, and trust:it, and pray for it as you never did for anything mortal before; own it, and belong to it; your own identity lost in that of another, the mission of a, woman's destiny accomplished, for wifehood is the high and holy goal; and then talk ofteaching a district-school instead, pooh! Hattiejumped to her feet in a glow of enthusiasm, tossed back a cloud of amber curls, and stood looking at her' sister -Ike an argumentative fairy, all sparkle, youth, and  beauty; while she really believed herself to be a feminine Solomon. Ah, Helen did know! for had she not taken from her heart a love deeper and stronger than the light, gay nature of- Hattie was capable of feeling? She had laid, as an offering on the altar of duty, her womanhood's high mis- sion; and she rememb'red, with a pang of bitter humility, that she had said to Asa, when he was pleading with her to spare his happiness from the death-she was dealing it, "How can I desert my youpg sister?" That had been Qnaofluty's reasonings, and now how lightly this young sistaer eold desert her. Then came the recollection of her mother's mournful prophecy, "They will all grow up and leave me by and by" Alfredwas gone. Hattie stood ready to renounce her homeland name for that of another, and would not May i and Bell eventually do the- same? elen was the child of her mother's disappointed youth, 'o nsecrated in some strange way, before her birth to share ,that0iQother's grief and trouble, and be the strength and Ejjdgmentrs thinger 'sA  plastic character plainly l dc i J:Itele/ had intuitively realized this mystic bond while yet a child, and as she grew older, she unconsciously gavetit:te first pl^cein her heart. The pretty birdlings :        '":*   HELEN ETHNGERI.         199 ^ one after the other might eagerly wing their way out -of the homely parent nest, but she would remain, let the wild winds of adversity toss it fiercely as they might,-or even dash it, old and broken, to the ground. The falling tree must needs retain some of its branches, and Helen quietly assumed the trust. Hattie, having relieved her mind, waited in vain her sister's reply, and slighting of. her too, when she had an- ticipated a very long-moral lecture on the subject of de- ception. She felt guilty with Helen sitting there so grave and still, and to avoid the silent judgment of her gentle eyes, she quickly slipped from the room, and l11 the rest of the day was circumspectly invisible. Left alone, Helen laid aside her sewing and went to the window.  The aspect without was dreary and chill enough. The rain pattered against the panes like great- tears, and sobbed through the young leaves down to thi drenched earth in driving floods. It pelted the swelling buds of the apple-tree, and rattled on the roof -in giuxty i sheets with a bleak and steady sound that saddened her unspeakably. The world was so cheerless and eompty; life such a wearisome burden. She leaned her head on her hand, and gave way to a fit of despondency, -How weak she was after all her boasted strength. How hun- gering for the affection she thought she could lie con- tentedly without. The woman within her reached forth to grasp the wondrous love that is never to be foundiat a - father's hearth-stone. The great yearning for home and husband and children, that is so much the part of a--true woman, she had discountenanced, and now-she sat looking at her empty, unsatisfied heart as we look at the grave where our dear dead are buried; knowing they can come no more to us. She had made the sacrifice, but who cared for it? who would be grateful? What was there left in   -200      HELEN ETHNGERB, life worth living for? The pitiless rain, beating furiously against the pane, answered her in a mocking, angry mood. Hope and heart and courage deserted her, and Helen Ethinger, for the firsttime in her life, sobbed out her an- guish in a torrent of tears. She could not endure the cold, cloudy light of that dismal day. She could not bear the-sound of the rain andtthe soughing voice of the wind. She drew the curtain, threw herself on the bed, hid her pale face in the pillow, and for two hours lay very quiet, neither sigh nor motion telling of her mind's deep unrest. CHAPTER XVII. HELENTS DREAM. :THE burden of sorrow weighing down heart and brain seemed all of a sudden to leave her, and she grew strangely calm. From  the far corner of the gloomily- shaded room appeared the figure of a child--oh, so beau- tiful in its rare angelic loveliness, so divinely beautiful that Helen gazed?entranced on its perfect and- holy face without daring to" addrbss anything so infinitely of God. The child paused on beholding her, as if fearing to ap- proach one so sorrowful and despairing, and looked at her long in silence. -The large blue eyes, fringed with golden lashes, were full of heavenly tenderness and lifted to her lovingly, as if asking to be caressed. The little thing was as white as Parian marble, crowned with a saintly halo of pale yellow hair, not a blush of color on the smooth cheeks, not a rose-tint of mortality on the holy lips. The lovely vision wore the simple night-dresq   HEL-EN ETHNGER.         201' of a child, gathered up with two tiny waxen hands, and the little feet, pure as white rose-leaves, stood irresolute on the faded carpet, eager, yet hesitating to advance lest its sweet presence should be repulsed, Helen had never seen a. child so exquisitely beautiful' as this, so purely seraphic in form and attitude. The glory shining from the angel-eyes illumined the still fea- tures, and lit up the soft flowing hair with unearthly radiance. She was soothed and fascinated by the mute love beaming from the child's soul-glorified face, and cried aloud to the angel apparition, stretching out her hands to it in rapturous welcome: "Oh, come here, you beauti- ful little creature! Come, sweet babe; you will be cold out there alone. The merciless fain, the fierce winds and storms of the world will beat you down, and you will perish uncared for and unwept. Come and lay your little white feet close to my heart; its sorrowful throbs will keep them warm.  Come, I am  dying for the touch of your fairy hand and the pressure of your sinless lips"  The child gladly sprang into her sheltering arms, and, with a new, all-worshipping love, Helen folded her-to her bosom. Then a; great peace came to her-a wondrous rest and a deep sense of tranquil joy. For days-ah weeks--she kept the cherub-child with her-happy only when in its presence, content only when it was near. Sleeping in her arms or sitting at her feet, it was always her courage and solace. And during all this time- strange forgetfulness--she had never inquired the child's name nor from whence it came.. One day, recollecting the oversight, she softly asked, "What is your name, darl- ing? and where did you come from?" "Why, don't you know?" she breathed in reply. "My iame is Hope; and I came from heaven to aid you in un- name                you- in8 -unr   202      HELEN ETHNGER.             i derstanding God's blessed will aright. He sent me to comfort your troubled heartand my mission is accom- plished." The beautiful thing unfolded a pair of hitherto invisi- ble wings, and slowly flew away. The golden hair faded, the blue eyes looked at her through the mist of distance, fainter and fainter grew the child-form, and so, smiling, with uplifted finger and glory-encircled head, it drifted farther and farther away, and was lost to mortal view. Helen sprang up with extended arms to stay its noise- iess flight and-awoke. It was only a dream! No child-vision, wth celestial eyes and saintly hair} looked out from the shadowy corner, but hope, blessed hope, was in her:heart, and it gave her strength to again resume the duties of life. God sent his, cheering angel to dispel the lowering clouds of doubt and depression darkening  i her soul, and Helen had done with complaint and dejec- tion.  The rain was still falling in driving sheets, and the gloom of the April twilight filling the room, but she did not heed either. "Naow I have myinspiration!" she cried, elated; "now I will paint: my dream of Hope, and I will so reproduce the sublime infant face that every one shall see on it the imprwesl'of something notsof the earth, but altogether of heaven. '.. The next day Helen shut herself up in her room, and   I soon there grew upon the canvas a  seraphic child-face  1 with white wings half unfolded, a smiling upward gaze, and, floating golden hair.  uWhen Hattie saw it, she said, reverently, "Helen, this is divine. You have caught the expression of an angel -:of soinething, tenderly holy-as I  never saw it por- trayed before. How did you get so perfect an ideal?" :   HELEN ETHNGER.         203 - Oh, it came to me in a dream." "Ah, yes; in a moment of grand inspiration, no doubt. What do you call it?" ( I call it hope-my beautiful child Hope." CHAPTER XVIII. APPLE-BLOSSOMS. T was seldom that Hattie indulged in twilight musings; and when Helen came in her room one evening, and disfcovered her sitting pensively at the window, she thought her sister must have something on her mind more than common. It was a balmy evening in May; and seeing Hattie not inclined to talk, Helen drew a chair to the opposite side of the window, leaned her elbow on the sill, and fell to watching the dusk steal down among t' leaves. The room overlooked the apple-trees by thear-- den wall, and they, as well as the orchard beyond, were white with blossoms. Their fragrance filled the air, and floated up to the window where the two sisters sat facing each other in silence. The young moon came slowly peering into sight, and laid her pale kiss like a benedic- tion on the whispering leaves-and the monumental pyra- midsof the white lilacs. The higher the silver crescent climbed, the more restless became Miss Hattie; and she uneasily glanced first at her sister, and then at the apple- trees, as if she very much wished the former was mine- where'elsel She had no sympathy with Helen's dreamy reverie; for-the unpoetical young' lady was not thinking w of the unrivalled beauty of the evening; she was simply , X1, . "      ';       -   - 204     HELEN ETHNGERE.  waiting for Mr. Frank Buel, and watching for his signal to summon her to him,- under the apple-trees. It was their favorite place of meeting, and neither considered it I either in the light of romance or folly; although to an uninterested observer it largely partook of both. It was i a sober, serious necessity with her, if she would see her lover; and that she was just the girl to do at all hazard. Every passing moment brought his coming nearer; and there sat that placid Helen, still as the moonbeams, and her eyes fixed on the wall intervening between the gar- den and those delectable apple-trees. Was there ever anything so provoking? Hattie was getting dreadfully nervops, and finally, seeing there was no likelihood of her going, was obliged to make her a confidante, and ask her, as a particular favor, not to stare quite so hard at the wall. Assuming a forced indifference, she leaned a little out of the window, so that Helen could not see the sudden crimson flooding her cheeks, and said, "I am looking for - a - a pfrson. Frank sometimes walks of an evening over there, and sometimes I walk ith'him. It is very pleasant under the apple-trees, when you have pleasant company." "Hattie!" "There, don't remonstrate. Be good, Helen, and don't scold me. I can't help it; -and please spare 'me a lec- ture," she 'interrupted, putting her arms about her sister's neck, in a coaxing way, and trying to hug her into ac-   quiescence.   But Helen did remonstrate.  ' - 4i- attie, is this ,right? is it maidenly? is it prudent? I "fiot' sanction what I know to be wrong; and so, dear seii,-do not go. It seems to me, if Mr. Buel were really :-gentleman, and sincere in his regard for you, he would It: ask you to compromase yourself in this manner.'  O          A,          HELEN ETHNGER.         205 "Really a gentleman!"Hattie fired up at that. "I wish you would not speak in that way of the man who is to be my husband, Helen; I won't listen to it. Frank is a gentleman; and he loves me, and I love him; and, I'll see him when and where I like, there!" she spunkily turned around, and would not look at Helen for saying such insulting things of her darling Frank. "Do you think Mr. Buel would approve of or permit his sister to do as he is every day tempting you to do, Hattie?" She was a trifle disconcerted at the question, but read- ily found an excuse. "That is no argument. Florence is not situated as I am; and if she was, I am sure he would approve." "Then he is not a discreet brother, nor -a safe lover. Take my advice, little sister; respect your womanhood, and give up meeting Mr. Buel clandestinely." "Ask-me, Helen, to live without breathing; for I can do one as well as the other. Frank is not going to deceive me, nor -compromise me. A pretty idea, H must say, when I have known him all my life; when he has tied my shoes, and pinned my apron; lifted me over fences, and shared his goodies. And I tell you again, I love him; so I am bound to believe no ill of him, let who will traduce him behind his back."  This spitefully, and a furtive look towards the apple- trees. "I am ashamed to hear you speak in this fashion, Hat- tie; and it more than all convinces me that your infatua- tion with Mr. Buel ought not to be continue - to the ex- tent you are. carrying it. At least, I will not countenance it," said she, firmly. "Well, I did not ask you to come up here; and I only told you because I could not get away without. But one 18         ,   206      HELEN  ETHNGERo thing, Miss Cautious; if you will not tacitly countenance this awful depravity of mine, neither dare you betray it; -for it will raise such a rumpus in a paternal quarter, that you 'll never have the courage to face it; and the goftg of Alfred will be heavenly compared to the uproar of my exodus. And now-- hush I don't you hear?"* A low whistle trembled in the air, and a small dark object, very much resembling a young gentleman's hat, appeared above the wall. "That's him. I won't be gone a minute; and you are privileged to remain sentinel up here until I return. That is deferring to the proprieties, I 'm sure. ' With such. a careful sister on guard there can be no possible harm, and I can see my- my villain in safety," said Hattie, in laughing sarcasm. The low whistle was repeated, and the stealthy hat peered over the wall a second time in anxious survey of Mr. Ethinger's asparagus bed. "He is getting impatient, and he will keep on whist- ling until I come, if it' all night, and- every time louder. Dear me, don't look so dreadfully shocked. I must go," and with that she- snatched up a crimson scarf hanging over the back of her chair, and was out of the room in a second. Helen saw her cautiously emerge from the house, glide along the wood-shed, past the currant-bushes, and so -on to the garden wall. Frank helped her over, keeping well in the shadow of the trees, and they paced to and fro.* undeti the drooping branches quite oblivious of Helen, and iiot caring what she thought. And they really made i a handsome picture--Hattie- daintily lifting her light muslin dress from the dew, and Frank talking very earn- estly, as if trying to convince her of some very important question. The gras-s beneath their heedless- feet was   HELEN ETHNGER.         207 strewn with petals, white and pink and rose-tinted, and they sifted down on her yellow curls with every passing breeze, The atmosphere was heavy with their perfume, sweet as the fragrance that once surrounded Emily'Bassford and her lover whet they walked under the blossoming apple- trees. Hattie was but repeating a page on the history of her mother's girlhood. Helen's apple-blossoms were thistle-blooms. Ill-omened had been the verdure of her tryst, and sad had been its sequence. She turned away from the window, and when she looked out again, half an hour later, the lovers were nowhere to be seen. Hattie's minute proved a wonder- fully long one, for more than an hour passed before she returned, and Helen commenced to pace the floor in sheer anxiety. In the midst of her disquiet, Hattie, considerably out of breath and unusually agitated, rushed in. Her eyes were like stars apnd her cheeks scarlet. "Such a narrow escape as I had," she hurriedly ejacu- lated. "I came pat on father, and had to seek refuge in the smoke-house, where, for the last ten minutes, I have been a close prisoner." She laughed, -setting out a trim little boot to see how it had stood the dew. "But where were you the rest of the time? I could not- see you from the window, -and you must-confess your. minute was a remarkably long one," questioned Helen, uspiciously, "Oh, we went a piece-down the lane; and it 'sall de- cided that I am to throw up the school, 'Frank won't hear to it; says I 'll only fail; and I kaow-,J will, too. I am going to send in my resignation to-morrow," ;- "What do you mean to do all summer? I tiathe time is come for me to tell you that we are poorflatti, and -- "   208     .HEL-EN  ETHNGER. "Perhaps I may not be here all summer. There, now don't quiz me! I shall take Frank's advice about the school, for indeed I am not fitted to assume the charge of a whole tribe of everybody's children." It was useless for Helen to expostulate. Hattie was in one of her wilful moods, and there was no persuading her differently from what "Frank said." Not a word did she utter in reply, but Hattie saw a sad reproof in the slow uplifting of her kind brown eyes -a something of pain, trouble, and concern that instantly melted her asperity, and brought"her back penitent to her side. "You must not feel hurt, Helen; I am sorry I've been so cross and naughty. There, kiss me, and I won't leave you with my sin-on your conscience. You may tell mother, if you like, that I am fond of Frank; in fact, I want her to know. She is the dearest little mother, and you are the dearest little- sister in the world; and I am willing you should both know how happy I am. Good- night! and sweet be :your dreams, as mine are- certain to -be," and Frank Buel's pretty affianced vanished, leav- ring her sister to find her way to her own apartment, and there lie awake all night, wondering and fearing where this secret lveaffair would end. *  True. to- her word, the next day Hattie wrote to the trustees, politely declining the school; and in so doing, she enraged her father past description. He stormed and swore and threatened, and declared she should teach; and -she shook her head -decisively, implying that she would n't, and stubbornly held hero ground against all he could -door say. Mr. Ethiqger shut her up in the garret for two days and nights,::and scolded her through the door. Miss Hattie Ethinger calmly submitted to the cruel incarceration, and spiritedly replied through the door. Mr. Luke reduced her diet 'to bread and water, O1   HELEN ETHNGEB.         209 and Miss Hattie ate it in meekness, but would not yield. The father was oppressive, the daughter opposing. In a week, Miss Abby Turner was appointed teacher, and that ended the siege. Hattie reappeared triumphant, but was looked sourly at by her defeated father. He forbade her to visit her dear friend, Florence Buel. He locked up her best dress, and she was forbidden to set foot -be- yond the limits of the door-yard. She smiled at it all, and saucily refused to cry, or even notice these multiplied indignities. Helen acquainted her mother with the state of Hattie's heart, and that good lady was no longer at a loss to ac- count for her daughter's extreme dislike to teaching. There was still sufficient of the woman remaining un- crushed in her nature to take -pride in a daughter mak- ing a " good match; " and she thus expressed her mind to Helen:        ,  "I will not stand in the way of her happiness. Frank is-certainly all one could ask in a husband; but Mr. Ethin- ger does not like him,--you know what- I mean. He would not consent to her marrying Mr. Buel, or any one else, for that matter; because she would never be a help to him-,as you are , and his business is so embarrassed at the present time, I suppose. he thinks we all ought to do something towards helping him along." "No: father will never agree to it," said Helen. "I wish he would; though she is so young. - Poor child.4 there is little pleasure for her here. She is such- a sunbeam, and her home has so few attractions, that I can- not blame her for wishing to escape its dulness." Mrs. Ethinger did not mention the subject to Hattie; bSUt one day, not long after the above conversation, she patted her mother's cheek, and archly askedi "Are you willing, mamma? I know Helen told you." 18*    210      HELEN ETHNGER. "Yes, dear; but you are so young!" said mamma, readily comprehending the question.  "That is my misfortune, not my fault; and I am cor- recting it every day. You will like Frank, mother,-he is such a good boy,--and he has always been kind to me, even when I was a wee, wee little girl." ( And your father, dear?" "Oh, I don't care for him!" Hattie conceded her father no confidence whatever, and left his consent entirely out of her connubial air- rangements. CHAPTER -XIX. A SECOND REBELLION. ' 'ITOTHNG of note occurred until the latter part of Ll .June, when one afternoon, while Mrs. Ethinger and her two eldest daughters were seated in the sitting- room, busy with their needles, they were suddenly sur- prised by -the entrance of -Mr. Ethinger. There was no mistaking the thunder-cloid(on his broew, and the wrath- ful gleam of his cold gray eyes. Walking directly- up to Hattie, he roughly, laid his :hand -on her arm, and ad- dressed her in a tone of mingled rage and authority. "I've got a word to say to you, young lady. You have deceived me long enough, and now I want the truth." They all knew what- it meant. He had discovered Hattie's secret, and to prevaricate was useless. Helen auight lher breath, and Mrs. EthingerAturned deathly   HELEN ETHNGER,         2" white. As for Hattie, she paled a little, and haughtily freed herself from his grasp. "Your, manner, for a gentleman, is rather rude; and whatever you may have to say to me, you are at liberty to speak." The slight young thing drew herself up proudly, and was not a whit dismayed. "Be silent, you saucy baggage! Do you know what people are saying of you and that scoundrel, Frank Buel?" roared Luke, in a terrific passion. "That we are very nice young folks, I suppose," said she, in a sweetly even voice, assumed expressly to tantalize her incensed father. "They say you meet him by stealth, like a common wanton; that is what people say of you." "Well, I don't deny that I am somewhat fond of Frank." Mr. Ethinger's rage knew no bounds at this cool reply. "You brazen-faced creature; do you dare to talk like this to me?" "I do, most-certainly. Stop! don't lift your hand like that towards me; for, as my brother once said: 'You do it at your peril.'"The girl stood before him fearless and defiant, a scornful smile wreathing her lips, and the blue eyes flashing a world of angry contempt. , Helen turned away her head, and Mrs. Ethinger sank back powerless in her chair. Her sewing fell unnoticed to the floor, and she looked from husband to-daughter in blank affright, Mr. Ethinger was, for-the moment, speechless with sur- prise and anger, and Hattie, seeing her advantage,-un- flinchingly followed it up,. "I might as well speak my mind now as at any time, and I am ready to take the consequence. You turned my only brother from the door, and you are welcome to do c* "  \,     .  . *  '   212     :HELEN ETHNGER. the same by me.- You abused and trampled. on Alfred until you made him reckless and vicious; you taught him to hate you; killed all that was good in him, and then ex- pected him to honor and obey you. You have always been selfish and inhuman in your treatment of us all; and what wonder thatlyou stould reap the benefit of it. They may bear it-my mother and sisters - but I will not. As a child, Ifeared you and was silent; as a woman, I boldly speak my mind; and I charge you with cruelty and oppression beyond the right of any father to exercise; and that you made my brother wicked and an outcast, I will never forgive."  Her manner, and the mention of Alfred's name, mad- dened him into a paroxysm of uncontrollable fury, and he advanced menacingly:  "Don't dare to throw that villain's name in my teeth, or, by heavens, I 'll make you rue it," fumed the sardonic old man; but Hattie winced not an atom. "If Alfred Ethinger isa villain, to his father I impute ' the cause.- You never gave him love, nor even kindness, no more than myself; and why should you exact it of us? tI owe you naught but mere existence,:and that you have ever made as joyless and burdensome as you possibly could ." ,- The old man was utterly confounded, and glared at her in silence, She stood the scrutiny serenely, not an eye-  lash falling before it. Luke recovered his voice, and stamped his foot fiercely, the floor fairly cracking be- neaith his savage vigor, and quite oblivious of his rheu. :matism. "You were always a lazy good-for-nothing, and never earned your salt. . Who has put bread in your mouth and clothes on your back ever since you were born?" -"Luke- Ethinger, of course; and it is what he should have done."        -                 HELEN ETHNGER.         213 "Hold your tongue, miss. And this accounts for your playing the fine lady; there is a lover to be consulted; there are stolen meetings after dark; and yet you brassily call yourself a decent girl'! Get out of the house! Off with you, and take your shame-to the Buels, 'where it belongs!" "I don't understand what you mean by 'shame,' unless it's having you for a father, in which case I admit the compliment; but I am ready to go, and Frank is quite ready to take me. The blow had to come, and I am not, sorry it is over with,' retorted she, folding her arms, and looking at him with a tormenting smile of indifference. Luke saw she was only too willing to take him at, his word, and his anger instantly assumed a new phase. "You shall never marry that rascal with my consent; never." "That is a small matter; for there is such a thing as marrying him without your consent." "Do you think he will marry a thing he traipses with after dark, and whose name he has made a foul by-word in stables and taverns?" "Perhaps he will, if I coax him. If he don't, I 'll sue him for breach of promise, and the damages would be more than I could earn in ten years by school-teaching. Now, there is an investment for you," demurely laughed the exasperating little plague. "You are a low, degraded wretch i" foamed Luke. "Thank you, father;" and she made him a profound obeisance. "You have reached the end of your rope, young lady, and" -- "Yes, as far as you are concerned."  "Silence 1 You will see how far I am concerned. You do not deny that the shameless stories afloat about you and this rascally Buel are true?" --   214      HELEN ETHNGER. "No; why should I?" Luke shook in every limb. "You admit it, then?" " "Yes; if you will have it so. I have met Frank Buel at daylight, midnight, twilight, and noonday, Sunday and weekday, and--wherever I could, unknown to you. I don't repent, and I am not ashamed of it, and, under like circumstances, I would do the same again." Both Mrs. Ethinger and Helen-were aghast at the girl's unheard-of effrontery, and sat speechless, ihardly believ- ing their senses that it was Hattie addressing her father in this outrageous style. Luke was white to the lips, and the uplifted hand clenched above his gray head trembled like a leaf in the blast. "And you tell- me this, girl, without a blush, without a look of shame or a grain of dAency?" "Pray, why should I do otherwise? A d where is the harm, since he is my husband, andshas been for a month? There, read that, and see if you 4are further traduce the name of Frank Buel's wife." i She flourished a paper--a vftmoral-looking and commanding bit of laper-triumphantly near her pa- rent's offended nose, and actually beamed with exulta- tion. "Frank won't marry me, eh? This little document settles that question, I think, fair and honorably, let who will cavil, and places me beyond your power. Now you 'know from whence I derive the! unbounded courage to safely carry me-through any sort of a dispute and the fiercest kind of hostilities. So cool your temper, for there is no such person in the wide world as Hattie Ethinger."  'That's so!" corroborated an emphatic voice, and Frank Buel burst ;unceremoniously into the room. The ' t '! . W     i   HELEN ETHNGER'.        215 windows were open facing the street, and, chancing to pass at the moment, he heard a fragment of the angry conversation, and immediately suspected what was up. Hattie ran to him, laughing. "It's all out, Frank, and the very mischief is to pay." There she dropped the cudgel, and left Frank to do battle for her, which he did in the most gallant and forc- ible manner. I 'd thank you to remember, sir, that this lady is my wife, and, by the Lord, it won't be healthy for any one to treat her unkindly." "If this woman is your wife, take her away, and never venture to cross my threshold again. I disown her, and say you are a cowardly thief to steal her as you have done. She is no daughter of mine, sir, and I want you both to get out of my sight." "And I never was glad to be in it," parenthesized Hattie. "I give her my curse, bitter and life-lasting; and you, sir, have my undying hate," continued Luke, in -a tone of baffled anger, looking from one to the other with eyes that were fixed and fierce enough to scare anybody but his saucy daughter. Mr. Ethinger's malediction was taken very coolly by those most interested. "Much obliged," said Frank, serenely; "curses and hate are ugly things, but they generally come back to the unchristian giver, augmented by a keen remorse; and I would spare you future distress of conscience. (C6om Hattie, put on your bonnet i we will not be the cause -of further inciting this gentleman's unreasonable rage. We will obey him, and leave his house at once.

I bid   216      HELEN ETHNGER. you- adieu, sir, and hope your rheumatism w11 not be the worse for this excessive agitation." . 'i,' Mr. Buel's politeness was oyerwhelming., 'Mr. Ethinger measured him an instant with his glittering gray eyes, -strangely large and searching, and without a word he turned on his heel and limped from the room. Contrary to all expectation, he refused them both a reply and his presence, and disappeared with a brow black as hate and lips compressed to rigidness. "I am in no hurry," said Hattie, looking after him approvingly. "You see papa has chosen the better part of -valor, and left us to our iniquities." Frank stood irresolute, and again urged a speedy de- parture. "I think our better part of valor would be to go also, Hattie. He may return; and this is, not altogether a pleasant business to brave." "Well, I know; but- I am used to it, and have ever so much'to-say to mother and Helen. Don't you seelthey are half dead with fear and curiosity, and-and- wounded love. Go away now; I want to be alone with them. Come for me in an hour; I'll be ready then, Frank, and will have obtained forgiveness by that time. Father has subsided to moody reflections, and there is no immediate danger -of a renewal of hostilities." Frank good-naturedly acquiesced, pretty well convinced that his spunky little bride could " hoe: her own row ;:' and when he was gone the three women looked at each other curiously. Hattie threw her arms around her ,imother's neck. . "Am I not a heroine, mamma; and have n't I made a Wonderful romance of it?" :- You have, indeed,'*' said Mrs. Ethinger, in a faint voice.   HELEN ETHNGER.         217 The impulsive child did not fail to notice that the low reply contained a sorrowful reproach, and there was a sudden end to her forced mirthfulness. "We have some curiosity, Mrs. Buel, notwithstanding our fright and astonishment, and would very much like to know how you managed it," said Helen, and her face was far enough from a smile. Hattie came over to her sister penitent and imploring. "I know you are hurt, but Hoh forgive me, Helen, and don't ask me to explain. It will make me seem so treacherous and deceitful, and I really did not mean it to be either. Forgive me, do, please, and I 'll be so happy." 6 And Mrs. Hattie, to intensify the declaration, Dapped the climax of her contrition by bursting into tears and curl- ing down on the floor, so, her sunny head rested in her sister's lap, and her pretty face hid its tears and trouble in the consoling folds of Helen's white dress. And thus buried out of sight, she sobbed forth a moralizing plea that showed her to be a child of some wisdom after all!. !"Oh, Helen, be careful of May and Bell -when they come to this giddy, waywar4 period of their lives. It is a dangerous way to be won, for all men are not like Frank. Oh, he is so good, so dear, and so kind and true," and in praising Frank she quite forgot to be wretched or admonishing any longer. Indeed, she smiled quiite brightly through her tears, and appeared to think everybody ought to He deeply impressed by the whol souled en- comium. Being assured of the forgiveness of both Helen and her mother,-for how were they to help pardoning such -a purring, winsome, naughty little mischief, -Mrs. Buel stopped crying, wiped her eyes, and was almost as gay as ever. Now when they did not look so upbraidingly 19   '218     H1ELEN ETHNGER. At her, she was willing to make a clean breast of it, and deprecatingly began. "It all happened very natural!y,- if it was arrant du- plicity; and I -must say, Helen, you are not an observing person, if you are a genius; though I suppose it is because you are not artful like me, who am always doing some- thing I ought n't to do; and being so good yourself, you see no evil in others. You remember the evening you played duenna in the window. Well, we were married that night. Frank talked me into it. He said there had been bother and skulking enough, and he was not going to do it any more. He had it all arranged beforehand, 'though I did n't know it, and we just ran over to the par- sonage and were privately married. The minister's wife and daughter ere were witnesses,' and they promised -to keep the affair quiet. I thought of you star-gazing in the window, and I hadn't the heart to do it at first, but Frank is so positive, and would n't take no for an an- swer, so I consented. It got my nerves in such a state of excitement and- my heart in such a flutter, that I hardly knew where I was or the magnitude of the step I was taking.-, And you may- depend, I was a: sorry-looking bride. The dew took all the starch out of my old muslin dress,asndit was-Iike a limpsy rag when I stood up for the solemn ceremony, and the scarf had rumpled my hair, and I was terribly out of breath from the hurry and con- fusion. But it was all over iita minute. The minister congratulated us; so did his wife, so did his daughter,-  BSlha is dead in lovewith Lew Gurney unknown to her tier, a:nd she-sympathized 'with me the more on that ac- aUfit; -nd whenwe were Wrclear -f the house we hastened ba'cktoithe apple-trees. - The fact of you knowing of my ibseti'didt se rie       y perturbatioen, and I was anxious to get back as soon as possibles To add to   HELEN 'ETHNGER.        219 my affliction, on my return I came plump on father going to the barn, and barely had time to hide in the smoke- house." / "So that much of the story you told me was true, at least," sarcastically interrupted Helen. The severity was quite lost on Hattie. "Yes, true indeed; and not agreeable. A bride. navi- gating through a wet orchard at night and clambering over fences is no pretty sight I can tell you. And the many times I have been obliged, to reach love through a labyrinth of dew-ladened cabbage-heads, beet-tops, and cucumber-vines are trials such as I hope none of my sisters will ever be compelled to undergo." At this juncture of Hattie's confidence, a rush of feet in the hall announced the return of May and Bell from' school. Seeing everybody so suddenly silent, a perfect avalanche of questions followed their entrance, and,- as some explanation was necessary, Helen briefly told them that Hattie was married,-- that-their sister was now Mrs. Buel, and would shortly leave them never to live at home again. Whereupon Miss May affirmed the proceeding "'perfectly splendid," and Bell as promptly affirmedd it "too bad," and "real mean of Hattie." A carriage drove up while the talk was at its height, and Mr. Frank Buel sprang out.  "You have come in style. Why, I did not expect such splendor," cried Hattie, running to meet him, and gener- ously dividing her affection between love for/her husband and love for her husband's elegant equipage Lranlk, fop a moment, had a rival in his horses, as mQny anotheir man has had,'but the dear, single-hearted fellow did ac know it. He was so pleased to see her happy, that h1 caught her in his arms and gave her a kiss and a toss all at once.             -    -220     HELEN ETHNGER. "I am glad you like the! bays; they are beauties- thorough-bred, every inch of them. I I never had much. opportunity for courting in the regular way, so I 'll have to introduce the fashion after I am marridd, and, to com- mence, we will drive for an hour this afternoon, if you are in the mind." "Oh, I am in the mind,-you may be sure; but you must go in and beg my mamma's pardon first, as I have done; and Helen's, too; and see that you are sincere about it," said Hattie; pushing him into the room, and leaving him to make his -own peace. Helen's calm eyes made him-feel a culprit, and the self-reliant Frank, efor once, was slightly ill at ease. "I presume Hattie has told you all there is to tell; and I trust her pardon also includes mine. You are now my si:ster Helen, in earnest; and I am as proud of the title as Alfred used to be. .If Mr. Ethinger persists in being unamiable, I pray you not to frown upon us; for I pledge yoi my word, we will- never do so again," concluded Frank, with refreshing candor. "'I!am fain to believe you never will," said Mrs. Eth- ".alf crying, half smiling. "I ca't give you the p]a:/Tmy  heart of the boy I have lost; but I can love, Wa9 -i a son, welcome you to my affection." Frank tenderly embraced his new mother, shook hands with- the girls, and kissed them all around, in token of brotherlod.  'I, shall have to ask you to pack up my things," said Hatjtie, turning to Helen' and slowly putting on her hat mo- aniet  " ,We are going to drive for an hour, and I suEppose  ' will not: come back."' Helen: bowed assent, -t :daring to trust her voice, and silently followed with  :' rest to see her into -the carriage. Beneath the cherry- ' trees Hattie paused, and glanced furtively back at the old   HELEN ETHNGER        . 221 worn door-stone; then she affected a light manner, and playfully said to her husband: "Helen used to warn me of you, Frank and now, although she has admitted you to favor, she never means to approve of courting by moonlight under the. apple trees." "It is not pleasant," replied Frank, innocently. "Re- sorting to the company of grasshoppers and spiders is not comfortable ; nor are they the most agreeable associates. And what with crickets getting up your sleeve, and ap- ple-tree worms spinning down on your hair, and unman- nerly beetles bumping against your face, ad 'lightqin' bugs '-as Bell calls them darting around you from all quarters, it is a deuced annoying busines." "And don't you undertake it, 'May," warneAd attfi fearing that young lady might contemplate following her example.                . "Oh, I am not afraid of caterpillars and cricke," re torted May, entirely misunderstanding her siste?'s kindly, admonition, Hattie could not forbear a smile; and Mrs. Ethinger softly stroked the dark hair of Anabel in a conteiplaive - mood.

"I'll not call this-,my last good-bye, for I hope to meet you all again before I go to my new home,--I mean ous home in Baltimore,-- Frank's and mine, - not his father's, -and then I'll write every week." She hesitated; drew closer to Helen, and whispered: "If you hear from Alfred,-you will let me know. If he gets in any trouble that may come to your knowledge hereafter, and you should need money, or help in any way, do not fear to ask me, Helen. I loved him so; loved him so, despite his faults, when we were children, that I can for- give his sins of later years.

Frank helped her in, the carriage turned around witl a light, easy movement, and- the blooded bays went whirling down the road at a tremendous rate, speeding past the angle in the fence- where the Canada thistles grew, and where Helen had made her sacrifice; where she had said to Asa Churchill, in compliance with the admonitions of a high duty, "I cannot forsake my young sister;" and yet how soon had this young sister forsaken her. The carriage swiftly disappeared behind the hill; and when lost to sight and hearing, each heart beating sadly under the gnarled old cherry-trees inwardly re- peated the mournful truth: "Hattie is gone! sweet, thoughtless Hattie Ethinger is gone!" CtAPTER XX. ADVERSIT'Y. U KE dropped the name of his offending daughteras summarily and inflexibly as he had that of his alien- ated son, and they were sounds he-would hear no more in the old home. He even forbade them to think of her, and commanded his wife to forget there was ever such a being in existence as Hattie Ethinger, which, it is need-- less to say, the mother found a very difficult thing to do, and which unnatural: task she -never did accomplish, though she studiously refrained from irritating her -xus- band by admitting her entire inability to comply with a request which Luke, no doubt, thought perfectly easy and  proper. Two young faces blotted-out of the family circle, two chairs empty at the table; two children gone from   224-     HELEN ETHNGOER. the gray old homestead with a father's curse upon them;  and, strange it is, they were the two who, as babies, had touched that stone in his breast which physically pos- sessed the functions of a heart. Luke ws fast becoming helpless from acute rheuma- tism, and his limbs, crooked and painful, could no longer be depended u pon. His rickety old low-seated wagon was now always in requirement, and his moans and mut- terings, while clambering in and out the well-worn vehi- cle, proved eyve that Wbe a very distressful exertion for him. But, if his!es were not to be trusted, and his fin- gers were raped an  tiff, his tongue and temper were yet unimpaired, and he contrived to be as severe and un- gracious in his affliction as he had been in health. His wife was the same patient, uncomplaining creature she had" always been, ready to obey his smallest whim and meekly bear his harshest epithets. Helen also, equally gentle and submissive, humored her father's alternate fits ofrage and sullenness, .and did all a loving daughter could do- toialleviate his sufferings, To be sure, she was re- /d by frowns and insensate grumblings, but that'did :iitimake her-duty the less apparent or her attention the eswillingly bestowed. May and Bell, on the ctrary, were careful to avoid the neighborhood of their father when he was doFn with one of his " spells," They had no idea of approaching so irascible an invalid in hope of ministering to his comfort or cheering his loneliness and whe  they saw Luke's left leg bound in red flannel, and detected an odprout him of hops and viegr, they were pretty ce^ to keep clear of his vicinitiy - Autumn broght the-   H lele. ad so long antici- pated and secretly dreaed, She hoped it would not fall so soon, that the impendin blow might be warded ofd another year, until she was a4bke to earn more, and with   -HELEN ETHNGER.         225 twelve months' longer grace perhaps Mr. Ethinger's af- fairs might brighten. But her sanguine speculations were vain. Payments could not be made when due; creditors, easy and smiling when Luke was prosperous, were now directly the reverse, and pushed their claims with inexorable business energy and determination; the mortgage was foreclosed, and everything was to go under the hammer. And, to make matters worse, Luke was confined to his bed, with little prospect of his leaving it for weeks. He was utterly helpless hand and foot- a pain-racked, distorted body that rheumatism had fiend- ishy disfigured, and made each joint and muscle a me- dium of excruciating torture. What- was to be done? Poverty and sickness came darkly hand in hand; ruined health and fortune stalked gritmly through the blighted Ethinger homestead, and the master lay powerless beneath the touch of disease and stern adversity. Mrs. Ethinger's whole time was devoted to her husband, who snarled and growled from the bed like a wounded bear, and-gave her not a moment's peace night or day. The poor woman knew not which way to -turn in her multiplicity of troubles, and on Helen devolved the hard task of saving from the remnants of a once comfortable independence the humble semblance of a home. The day Emily plucked up sufficient courage to tell her husband the full extent of their difficulties,-that the old place must be sold, that all must go,-he turned with a groan of consternation and a strangled cry of pain, and looked at her with fierce, incredulous eyes. He saw the truth in her sad, pale face, and fairly writhed him- self into ;a sitting posture. Despite -the' torture of his bandaged limbs, he tried to get up; and it was all Emily could do to keep him anything like quiet. "Sold out at auction, hey? Curse me if they shall! --  ".;   -226     HELEXN ETHNGE-R. I 'll kill the first man that dares to show his face on the premises!" he shouted, flouncing back on the pillows. And when he had fretted and fumed and raved a good hour, he: cut his vehemence short, and curtly bade his wife send Helen to him. In a gradual and involuntary way he had come to re- alize the invaluable qualities of his daughter's calm, prac- tical, and steadfast nature, though he stolidly refused to recognize the rare goodness and devotion of her heart; and the shy, reserved girl whom Aunt Becky used- to broadly hint was "not exactly right," in the time of his calamitous reverses and wearying illness was the only being Luke could look to for help and clear reasoning, Helen quickly responded to her father's crusty wish, and in a moment was at his bedside. His eyes were not k-ider than they had ever been, nor his manner more tender.  '"Shut the door, and come here!" he ordered. She did as requested, and stood waiting- his further wishes in silence. "'We are beggars, it seems, Do you hear that?-beg- -'There will be a little left," "What do you call a little?" "A thousand dollars, perhaps."

That you already know to be absolutely unavoidable." ( What, at auction?" "Certainly."     ' "It sha'n't be! I tell you it hda'Wt be sold in that way while I have the strength to crawl, or even draw a breath!" he cried, wildly waving lis arms above his head in a paroxysm of helpless rage. "It is useless to protest or threaten, for neither will alter the fact. All we can do is to submit; and that wh must do. The house is even now advertised, and the day of sale appointed," she replied, blended pity and regret trembling in her low, sweet voice. Luke raised himself on his elbow and looked at her fixedly. The frenzy and ferocity suddenly changed to blank despair, and he cowered -down in the bed,;Shiverimg as if attacked by a sudden chill. Helen endeavoried to soothe him, but with ill success. He half pushed her from him, and surlily said: "Now, I suppose you will be running off' with some loafer, and leaving us to starve alone." The undeserved accusation lkindled- a glow of indigna- tion; but she repressed a -resentful reply, and steadily answered: "Father, I will do all I can to lighten the lity of this not unexpected blow. I] have very little knowledge. of business affairs,-least of all of yours,- butf if yoU, will instruct me how to act, we may sate somethings out of the general wreck. Only tell ime what to do, and I will do it with all my heart and soul." , "You will, hey! A nice mess you will make of itl But I have no other way left than -to let you try. I'd be f fool to think of looking to your mbother.!She'd whim- per and sigh and snivel, and thaat's :Il. Do as you   228      H-ELEN ETHNG E R are a mind to. I don't care. There are the papers in that box on the table; take them, and don't bother me again. I want to die in peace." He turned his face to the wall, drew the covers tightly around him, and not another word would he utter. Helen took the box, and half the night was busy with its contents. Creditors and lawyers and legal formalities were in due time gone through with, and the day of sale arrived. House, wagons, horses, stock, everything within the jurisdiction of the law, went; and when the cry of the auctioneer had ceased, and the heavy tramp of purchasers and curious, staring idlers no longer re- sounded through the gloomy dwelling, Helen sat down alone to think. In thirty days they would be homeless. The generous purchaser had granted them that length of time to remain undisturbed in the old house where she was born, and her father's father before her. A groan from the next room smote sadly on her ear, a groan of mental and bodily distress. She must bestir her- self; the worst was now over, and the crippled old man, torn bypain and worried in mind; must not want. Hat- tie had escaped the downfall of her humible home, but Helen sat surrounded by its ruins, a patient sharer of its fate, while the younger sister revelled in ease and plenty. Luckily, she had been spared this crowning misfortune, ,and Helen was left to battle the storm of disaster alone. A light, tap on the door interrupted her train of earnest thought, and she wearily arose to open it. Squire Church- ill's kind old face was the welcome sight that greeted her eyes, .and she bade him come in, with a glad lighting-up of her grave countenance. I Good -afternoon, Miss Helen. I presume you have had a dreadfully annoying -day of it. How is Mr. Eth inger?" heartily inquired the squire, a ccepting the chair she offered, and regarding her very kindly.   HELEN  ETHNGER.        229 "Father is still quite i11, and this miserable business greatly adds to his sufferings." "No doubt: it's a hard thing for a man at his time of life; and I came up to see if I could be of any assistance to you." "You are very good, Mr. Churchill, and I am in need of help - so much in need of a little sound advice; and, until you came, I hardly knew where to seek it." The brown eyes Asa thought so gentle and soulful were misty with unshed tears, and their great, pure, upward look caused the good old squire to make a hasty dive for his red silk handkerchief and drag it forth from his coat-tail pocket with a slightly unsteady hand. "Well, well, child, don't give up. You've gone through it nobly. It's always the darkest just before daylight, and we must all have our ups and downs. May-be you will be the happier for this trouble; who knows? There is never an ill without a good somewhere. You are probably given a little time here. They can't well take a man out of a sick bed, if his house is no longer his own." "We are permitted to remain a month; after that," she paused, and folded her hands one over the other in a rest- less, doubtful way, "after that we must go--elsewhere." "Hum!" says the squire, reflectively, and thought- fully stroking his gray whiskers, as if to get a better idea of what that hesitating "elsewhere" meant. "I was thinking, as I came along, that Sweethrier Cottage might suit you admirably. It will be vacant by the middle of the month, and you may have it at a reasonable rent, a very reasonable rent." Sweethrier'Cottage was a handsome little villa, erected by a city gentleman of'more imagination than means, whd purposed to make it his summer residence, but fail- ing in funds, the cottage was-sold, and the property finally 20          4'^   ^-^   230     HELEN ETHNGER. came into the possession of Squire Churchill. It was just the place of all others to please Helen's refined, poetic taste, and, for a moment, she could not speak for gratitude. She laid both her trembling hands in his one large white palm, forced the tears from her voice, and said, looking gratefully at him with those wide, luminous eyes, that were like no other eyes when their deep, full gaze was upon you. "I have not the words wherewith to express my grati- -tude, Mr. Churchill, but, let me thank you, as well as I may, in the name of my afflicted father, my poor mother and helpless little sisters, who, like myself, are recipients of your great generosity." 0 Mr. Churchill blew his nose nervously, and winked very hard under his glasses, to make sure his eyes were not betraying his good old heart. "My dear girl, don't thank me; I won't listen to it. You deserve all the kindness I or anybody else can give you; and I dare say old Mr. Buel bought in considerable. The dun cow and red yearling anyway, and Hwell, I let them knock down the gray pony and old buggy to me. Hang it, when a man can't walk he must ride! If you conclude to take the cottage, you will all be settled by the first of the month, that is, if we can persuade Mr. Ethinger's rheumatism to leave him long enough to ad- mit of his being moved." "How -kind you are, Mr. Churchill; the sun is not so far behind the clouds as I at first feared. God is always nearer than we suppose, if we would only look up and believe in him." "You- are right, my child; a little faith and self-re- liance will take, us bravely through the darkest trials. And now I 'll be going-no, no; I tell you I will not hear another word of thanks. I am merely doing what            .            4   HELEN   ETHNGER.      231 a Christian and a neighbor ought to do -simply my duty towards an afflicted fellow-man. My regards to your mother. Good-afternoon, my child." Theold squire hastily bustled out, and could not help exclaiming, when clear of the. house, "By Jupiter, Asa, you are right. She is a noble woman!" which emphatic avowal showed conclusively that he was perfectly willing to concede the opinion of his absent son. Mrs. Ethinger had no particular attachment for the old gabled homestead. True, her children were born there; and for more than a score of years she had been its nom- inal mistress, but the old hall-door had opened to return no more two of her darlings; the rusty hinges of the old gate had shut out forever two disowned outcasts that were once her sweet, bright babies, and were still her dearly loved children. Remembering how joyless and unappre- ciated her life had been there, and the, many sorrows of her wifehood, it is not strange that Emily abandoned the time-crumbling old homestead with few expressions of re- gret. And I think Helen, too, was glad to leave it for a sunnier home--leave it forever, and all its saddening memories. With much grumbling and groaning and complaining, Luke succumbed to the inevitable, and, for the first time in his life, was compelled to submit to the will of others. He howled at the gentle but firm usur- pation of his long uncontested authority, but it did no good. Helen made her plans and carried them out un- heeding her father's insensate objections, and Mrs. Eth- inger quickly fell into the habit of looking to her daughter instead of her husband for advice and support. This was all very bitter for poor, stubborn Luke; but he had to yield, for his judgment was no better than. a child's-age began to mark the decay of his intellect, and disease had subjugated what there was left of his former   232      HELEN. ETHNGER. violence; at least it had deprived him of the power to ex- ercise it, other than his tongue was capable of conveying his uneffective ill-will to ears that wisely passed it by un- noticed. Well, they succeeded in getting him, safely moved at last, and had him comfortably established at Sweethrier Cottage in spite of himself. The dun cow and the red yearling, as well as the gray pony, were found in the stable when the family arrived at their new home. But it was thought best not to say anything to, Luke about that; he detested the squire and Mr. Buel so thor- oughly, that he would not be likely to accept a favor from either, though he were twice as lame and poor. Helen rearranged her little studio, and by the time they were quietly settled, her father comparatively reconciled to the change, and her mother happier than she had seen her for many months, the young artist discovered she had plenty to do. Mr. Churchill ordered two large pictures, and named a liberal price. Mr. Buel was anxious to se- cure a pair of landscapes of home scenery. The minister wanted a scriptural piece Hagar in the wilderness; and Dr. Knight also expressed a wish for something serious, Helen painted angel faces so exquisitely. And Mrs. Hattie Buel sent her a long letter enclosing a check for-five hundred dollars,--"Frank's present and mine, you know, to aid you in bearing up under the family difficul- ties;" and would dear Helen paint her just one small piece that should have a thought of home in it, and that ;- she could love above all pictures. The artist was a trifle t dismayed by this sudden rush of work, for, besides these numerous orders, she had on her easel at the time what Mr. Alfair was pleased to term her " master effort," and  he insisted that it should be finished before any other was commenced. He was determined to make her fame more than local; it should be national; and this "master effort" *' *'    HELEN ETHNGER.         233 was destined for the splendid rooms of Tinsley, Baxter and Co., Philadelphia, "and no disgrace to them either," thought the kind old connoisseur. And a proud day was it when it was finished, and Helen invited him to the cot- tage that he might enjoy a farewell criticism of the beau- tiful picture apple-blossoms. It was so true to nature --so like the rugged old trees back of the garden wall. The drooping boughs ladened with blossoms, the ground strewn all round with white petals; the moonbeams tip- ping the dark green of the leaves; the two enraptured lovers standing in the shadow of the caressing foliage, with a rift of light at their feet, and a mellow ray'just touching the girl's golden hair. When Mrs. Ethinger saw it completed, she burst out in a frightened voice: "Helen, how did you know? who told you of--of the idea?" Helen was surprised at her mother's extraordinary agi- tation. "Why, don't you remember. It is Hatties tryst. The wall and the trees and the blossoms, the still evening air, the shimmer of light and dense, quiet shade, Frank and Hattie talking softly in the pleasant, fragrant-gloom. It is all as I saw it that night from the window; and, at best, it is not an original, only a copy." Mrs. Ethinger recovered her composure. "But a very faithful copy. It is' beautiful, and to me perfection. So perfect, my daughter, that I fancied I saw a past reality in place of a present ideal." Poor soult for the instant, she had thought herself eighteen again, and the tryst of Hattie her own'! 20-* *  '   234      HELEN "ETHNGER. CHAPTER XXI. A NEW ERA. WHEN May once more smiled upon the earth,- 'the time of bursting leaf and bud, -pretty May Eth- inger's birthday came with it. She was named in honor of her birth-month; -and this year they would celebrate it at the cottage as no other Ethinger birthday had ever been signalized. On the eventful morning, she flew into her mother's room all in a flush of eager joy. "Sixteen-years old- to-day, mamma! Helen commem- orates it by finishing that very mysterious picture of hers, and you by looking happy, as I'd always have my own dear mother look." Mrs. Ethinger tenderly kissed her daughter; but be- fore she could repl-y,Helen entered the apartment, and with the same joyous cry, "Sixteen years old to-day, Helen!"May sprang into her sister's arms. "Oh, I have not forgotten it, you little enthusiast, for I intend- to make this an especial holiday solely on that account. I received a letter from Hattie, last evening. You -see she remembered you were sixteen years old to- day, as well as- I; and- now you shall come up. to my studio- and see the picture I've been painting for her, and that you have been so long anxious to get a peep at."  '-May needed no second invitation; and they were soon -in the studio. Helen drew aside the curtain from before the painting, and watched the effict on her sister with a little pardonable smile of pride as well as pleasure. It was the portrait of a beautiful girl-- a glad, eager face,   HELEN ETHNGER.         235 all light and glow and youth, and dark-blue eyes look- ing archly back over a snow-white shoulder at a cluster of May roses, starring a i wild, neglected bush that was like the one that used to grow in a grassy nook of the old homestead garden. The face was May's,--something that Hattie could love,- and had a thought of home in it. Helen took up a pencil and wrote beneath: "Sixteen years old to-day." "Why, it's me!" cried May, in ecstasy. "How could you ever do it! Helen? and that scraggy old rose-bush-- it's as natural as can be; and Hattie will be so delighted. Oh, mamma, I'm the happiest girl in the universe; and ought n't I -to be with such a dear mother and sister? Let us call Bell, and see if she will guess who it is." Miss-Bell was speedily summoned, and her opinion re- spectfully solicited. "Pooh, it's only May," said that small lady, on the in- stant. "Nobody but just our May; and she is sO proud of being sixteen." Anabel turned away indifferently, considering it no great affair; nor the being sixteen, either. While the others were yet admiring it, she went to the window and amused herself by inspecting the half-finished nest of a pair of robins. The feathered-architects were building in the top of a crooked old pear-tree, almost parallel with the window-sill, and she had an excellent opportunity for noting their curious proceedings. Presently her thoughts were detracted from the industrious robins, and she ex- claimed in a wondering voice: "Oh, my I if there a'n't a great expr-ess-wagon stopping before our door; and such a long boxl Do look, Helen; I 'm sure it must be a mistake." "I think not," sai -H elen, mysteriously; and she quickly led the way down-stairs, Mrs. Ethinger smiling, *    236      HELEN ETHNGER. and May and Bell in a maze of surprise and expecta- tion.     The two stout expressmnen brought in the long box; and when it was opened, a thing of marvellous beauty ; and silent melody presented itself to view. Bell danced,  and clapped her-hands in a transport of delight and  May was fairly beside herself with rapture. "Solid rose-wood, and of the very best. Oh, I can't breathe for joy!" she panted, in a tremble of gladness. "It is splendid -a real Steinway. Oh,*where-did it come from? is it for us?" and then she laughed, the rapid thought occurring: "Oh, I know; Hattie sent it; and i a'n't she a darling?" . The piano, which elicited all these trapsporting excla- i mations, was duly installed in the parlor, and they gath- ered around to praise and examine it at length. "What -a superb dark-polished piece of perfection it is; and have you noticed this neatly-engraved inscription above the? maker's name, May? It will well repay: you to read it," said Helen. "o Miay, from her sister Hattie, on her sixteenth birth- day."  !"What, mine? all mine!" said May, reading it over for the third time in rather a bewildered tone. "I can't believe my good fortune. It must be a dream; but the letter, Helen, the letter, that will make-it plain; and-I am dying tohear what she has to say."  The letter was immediately produced, and amid a pro- found and attentive silence, Helen read,- "I know how fond of music May is," writes sister Hattie, "and what a struggle you have had in defraying the expenses of her instruction. As I grow older, I begin to realize what your burden has been, dear Helen, and how bravely you have borne it. I Understand now how often I must have grieved you, and added immeasiur-   HELEN ETHNGER.         237 ably to your manifold cares. I was a heedless, ungrate- ful creature then, but I'll try and make it up now by aiding and sympathizing with you all I can. Let May be a music-teacher, if she must earn her bread. It is better than being a school-ma'am, if she makes such work with the prospect as I did." Then followed four pages of feminine gossip, with the usual amount of Frank said this and Frank said that; and when the letter)was finished, refolded, and replaced in Helen's pocket, May exclaimed, briskly: "Oh, now for a tune, and you shall see I am no dis- credit to my beautiful present, and that your hard strug- gle, Helen, in defraying the expenses of my instruction, has not been quite in vain."          v May sat down before the costly instrument, confident of her skill, and the well-trained voice and fingers did excellent justice to herself and teacher. They were all so exceedingly happy that poor old Luke was completely forgotten, and his wrath and his rheumatism tro*led them not. So pleasantly occupied, in fact, that they did not stop to ask themselves what- effect the extraordinary musical sounds might have on the choleric invalid. They were soon apprised of their forgetfulness, hdwever, for scarcely had May run her fingers over an octave before the hurried thump of his crutches signified his approach, and his voice rudely intruded on the music. "What's all this? Has the devil broke loose?" he angrily vociferated. And there he stood in the doorway, leaning heavily on his crutches for support, and one band- aged leg drawn up to keep its painl weight from the floor.  "I think he has," dryly obs e d Bell, in a low tone, making it a matter of choiph hich came under the head of Satan let loose.                        .%   238      HELEN ETHNGER, "Where did that thing come from? this looks like bankruptcy, I must say!" "It is a piano, and a present to May. I am sorry, if the music disturbed you," said Helen, soothingly. "Well, if such .a thunderin' concern is to be brought into the house, it seems I might be- told of it, without being left to find it out by such a 'devil's own din as this," he snapped. "It just came. The girls have hardly recovered from their astonishment yet." "Who sent -it?" "Hattie, in compliment of May's birthday." "' Bah, trumpery!" - They expected a rancorous outhurst, but were agree- ably disappointed. It was the first time Hattie's name had been mentioned in his hearing by any of the family since the, day she had been so sternly disowned by her father, and his mild way of accepting it amazed them. For a moment he stood with his eyes bent to the floor; re- peated "Trash, nonsense, trumpery!" in a half inaudible Xsnarl,/and hobbled out-again less noisily than he entered. Helen noticed how-gray he had become in the last year; how bent, infirm, and feeble; his face thin and haggard; and his weak, withered hands barely able to sustain him on-his crutches. Ought they not to try and find the poor old man's heart? May, too, looked after him with almost tender eyes; and Mrs. Ethinger hopefully conceived the sudden' thought, "Perhaps he will forgive Hattie,- and by-and-by permit her to come home again." The piano having been properly discussed and Mr. Ethinger mollified, other matters claimed attention; and each seti about contributing something towards the gen- eral festivity of the day. Bell 'busied herself by gather- ing great plumes of white and purple lilacs to grace the   HELEN ETHNGER.         239 sitting-room, where they were to have an early tea, and a big cake with a wreath of white roses around it, and "May " lettered in sugar in the centre. It was-to be a regular fte day, such as Alfred and Hattie would never have dared to*even dream of at -May's age. But times were changed, and a new era was dawning for the younger Ethingers. May came up and began to supervise Bell's floral ar- ' rangements. She was tastefully adjusting a tuft of clover and thistles in a small Bohemian vase, and evidently tak- ing considerable pride in. her selection, but for May's ill- desired interference. "That will be a unique bouquet, Bell, upon my word; the flowers are so very rare," laughed she, to her little sister's great annoyance; and Bell sharply retorted: "Originality is a virtue; and they are real pretty after the briers are pulled off. A'n't they, Helen? May is making fun of my thistles, and condemning my taste; but I am sure you have better sense." She held up the cluster for Helen's inspection, and it was indeed very pretty.         J ' "I always admire the thistle, and love them, too; be- cause they are neglected, I suppose." "There, May II knew you were no judge. Helen says she loves them, and so do I I " cried Bell, triumphantly. Helen abruptly turned away, and went to assist her mother in getting tea; and May retired to the open win- dow, leaving Bell to the pleasureful company of her clover and thistles. It seemed to May as if everybody ought to be happy that blessed day of days. The robins in the pear-tree were making love in their sweet bird fashion, buttherflies flew by' on golden wings, and everything appeared to be running over with sunshine and gladnes. It was too-   240      HELEN ETHNGER. bad people should ever be sick or lame, and unable to enjoy the hundred beauties of the glorious spring. How hateful it was to be plagued with-rheumatism, and be old. -When folks get gray and tremulous, they die; and then we feel sorry;,and wish we had loved them more, no matter if they were cross, and we were a little afraid of them. All of a sudden, a happy thought seized her, and it took her but a second to act upon it. "I 'll make the attempt anyway; he can't do more than scold, and I am used to that." She left the room unnoticed, and the next moment she stood beside her father's arm-chair; her face, eager yet fearful, and beaming with a new love, turned wistfully towards him, and her color coming and going in unison with the hope at her heart. W"I am sixteen years old to-day, papa; won't you kiss me?" The gray-blue eyes - not unlike his own--were elo- quent with aroused feeling, and he must have been a man of stone to repulse that gentle, timid, asking gaze. He looked at her in a queer, astounded, doubtiwg way, drew her -to him, bent his white head, and kissed' her, uttering not a- word, and seemingly unconscious of the act. May gained courage wonderfully; and her soft, warm lips felt strangely against his cheek, so wrinkled and pale; and the touch of herelittle hand travelling through his thin hair somehow gave him -a thrill of peace and rest as new as it was pleasing. "You have had so many fine presents, torday, that I 'll not deny you so small agift as my kiss," he said, affecting a satirical apology. "And I value it above all others," she whispered. "' More, dear father, than all the rest." Helen, also intent on a kindly overture, paused, electri- fied, on the threshold, undecided whether to advance or   HELEtN ETHNGER.         241 retreat. May beckoned her to approach, and endeavor- ing not to betray her surprise and joy, she said: "I came to ask you out to tea, father. We are having it early this afternoon, and a little extra; and would be so pleased to have yobu join us." "You don't want me. I would only growl, and make you all glad to get rid of me." "Well, we won't mind. We have laid the table for you, and tea is all ready." "Do come, papa; we'll help you out. You don't know how pretty things are fixed, and how nice and big the cake is," persuaded May. They took his silence for consent, and set about helping him to reach the sitting-room, where the inviting tea-table was spread.  Helen stooped to pick up the foot-cushion, and the harsh old father's hand, shrivelled and unsteady, fell softly on her hair. "My good girl! my good, dutiful daughter: God bless her!" he murmured, as if no one were near. That rambling touch upon her head forgave him the coldness and slight of years. She dropped on her knees at his feet, lifted the large, humid eyes that had so much of heaven in them, and prayerfully articulated, "Lord, thou hast given me  my reward!" She looked like a kneeling saint, and May could not speak for wonder. It was a  divine moment,-and neither of the sisters ever, forgot it,-for a caress from Luke Ethinger was a thing to remember. When Emily came in, she was astonished to see her husband seated at the table, and apparently in remark- ably good humor. "I am glad you are going to take tea with us," she remarked, in some trepidation,.for she had her doubts regarding the, stability of Luke's unprecedented good 2i   242      HE-LEN ETHNGER. humor. He neither replied nor frowned; so they con- cluded he was pleased, and the business of eating began. How-different was this neat little room from the low- walled kitchen of the farm-house; the blooming plants in the window, and Bell's canary twittering over his seed- cup; the vases of spring flowers, the curtains looped back with blue ribbons, and the air of content and refine- ment, that, however simple, never was to be found within the dingy, old homestead. What would Aunt Becky's horror have been, hld she been alive to-witness the ex- treme foolishness Qf Emily and her badly brought-up daughters,--pianos, pictures, flowers and birds, and birthday-cakes,-and not a-spinning-wheel or a carpet- loom in the house 1I Who ever expected to see such alarm- ing degeneracy in the Ethingers? Luke felt as if he were a visitor, and must behave himself. It would not do to snap at those handsome girls, nor that kind-eyed matron. He had best be civil, and guard his temper. Emily passed him a cup of tea, and -came near letting it ,fall, with the hot contents, in direct range of his bandaged knee, when a low "Thank you , reached her ear. After the teathings were cleared away, they all assem- bled in the parlor; Mr. Ethinger, still borne along on the tide of prevailing enthusiasm, occupied his arm-chair in one corner; andi May, bold from her recent victory, com- placently asked: "Would n't you like to hear me play, papa? My fingers are aching to make the further acquaint- ance of those beguiling keys; and you don't mind, do you?" -"No, if it pleases you; and I am somewhat deaf, any- how.' This was certainly*equivocal praise, but May did not suffer it to dampen her ardor, and commenced to sing the dear old song that never loses its charm: "Home, sweet ,/, -   HELEN ETHNGER.         243 home." She had a rich, well-cultivated contralto voice, and sang with much expression and feeling. Tears seemed to quiver through the chorus, and the soul-touching music fell away down into Luke's chill heart, and melted the ice that had lain there all his life. He sat shading his eyes with his decrepit hand until the last note died into lingering silence, then he dragged himself up from his chair, recovered his crutches, and only stopped long enough to say, as he was just leaving the room: "Good-night, children; good-night, all of you." May sprang from the music-stool, and ran after him, lugging the cushion. "Good-night, papa, and pleasant dreams." He would not have the cushion, shut the door, and vouchsafed no reply. "Well, he kissed me, anyway; he did, indeed," said she. "And he blessed me," added Helen. "Then God has been very good to us this day, and we are repaid the long patience of years," murmured the thankful mother. "Hattie sent an eloquent mediator in the piano," aptly observed Bell, regarding it with marked approval. "And the sun of my birthday has set on a peaceful home, with love in all our hearts," rejoined May. "And who says the thistle is not an emblem of good?" questioned Bell. "And a duty well done leads to true happiness." That was Helen's voice.   244      HELEN ETHNGER. CHAPTER XXTTI. KEEPING THE PROMSE. TWO weeks from that memorable day, May was train- ing some yellow honeysuckles up the lattice-work of -the porch, when Mr. Alfair stopped at the gate, and very concisely said: "Letters. for Miss Helen," tossing two let- ters over the pickets, and went on. May ran out, picked them up, and Helen received them in the same way as Mr. Alfair had consigned them to thegrass. May was too much interested in her honeysuckles to care about her sister's correspondence, and threw them in her lap with more vigor than grace, in a hurry to get back to the vine and the :lattice, Helen broke the seal of the one that happened to come first to hand. It was from the firm of Tinsley, Baxter & Co.; simply a business communication, informing her that the picture "Apple-Blossoms" had been disposed of for one thousand dollars, and she might draw on them for that amount. Helen was amazed. She knew it was of no such value as a work of art, as did the firm of Tinsley & Co.; and the letter continued: "It is not to say the painting in itself was of such superior excellence as to commraand so large a figure, but it chanced to strike the fancy of a gentleman who was willing to pay any price for it." }Helen smiled. "So it seems the purchaser paid me handsomely for a fancy, not taking into account any degree of artistic excellence. Well, then, it must be he saw in it the shadow of a past romance. There are so   HELEN ETHNGER.          246 many apple-trees and lovers in the world." Helen's fruitk ful mind began conjuring up another scene, " by theroad- side." What kind of a picture would that painted reminiscence make? There was ample scope for the fer- vent imagination of an artist. The cradled grain in the golden swath; the setting sun purpling the hills; the rank patch of thistles, and- the two figures that should be like- her thoughts did not go beyond that point. She even blushed to think they had gone so far, though she was alone, and the thought confined to her own breast. The second letter still remained unopened in her lap, and she took it up half listlessly, her mind yet occupied with the first, and the good news it contained. But the listlessness quickly vanished, the smile fled, and a death- like pallor overspread her face. The first line she read, seemed to render her helpless, and she sat like one stupe- fied. Her very lips were the hue of ashes, and her hands grew cold and numb as the hands of a corpse. '( And he has come to this," she gasped. "Ruined, ruined forever l'" Her voice lingered on the word dumbly, and she looked miserably around, as if afraid some one might hear. She felt as if every drop of blood was freezing in her heart, and not a vestige left to warm her marble features, or renew the activity of her paralyzed brain. -Her veins were surcharged with ice, and a chilly tremor crept ever her from head to foot. She sat there, in that pale, mean- ingless way, many minutes, insensible of the flight of time, the surprise and anguish were so great. At last, the poor girl aroused herself, carefully placed the letter in her bosom, and rose unsteadily to her feet. , She stood quite still a moment, her hand pressed to her forehead in an intensity of thought, and her eyes rapidly gathering that unfathomable look of care and' purpose, so characteristic of her when her heart was carrying its heavy burdens of   2-46-     HELEN ETHNGER. sorrow and family discords and estrangements. She went direct t  - her father's room, and when she got there, she was composed, resolute Helen Ethinger, collected in her manner and determined in her resolve. "I have come to bid you good-bye for a few days. I start for-Philadelphia this very hour." The 'old man gave a violent thump with his crutch, in an ineffectual attempt to spring from his chair, so mighty was his amazement, "To Philadelphia! Why, Helen, what folly; you can't go alone." "But I must," was her firm reply. "I say you can't, and that ends it. You've never been ten miles from this spoat in your life." "Nevertheless, I am determined to go. I dare say, I shall get' through safely, and in fifteen hours, God help-" ing me, I hope to be in Philadelphia." "Is it--a--is that boy in trouble?" faltered Luke, beginning to tremble. :"My brother is in very great trouble." "f And you are going to help him out of it?" "If ,can?" "The scoundrel is in jail, I suppose?" Luke did not suppose any such thing, and her answer completely as- tounded him..  He is." "In jail-in prison for a crime?" the old man blanched to the temples, and angry horror gleamed forth from his, faded .eyes, 'He is in prison accused of a crime." Luke shoolkas if an ague had seized him, and his sallow hand grasped the top of his erutch with a vicelike force. '?A rfelon.; Alfred Ethinger a felon-a criminal and my name brought to shame through him."   HELEN ETHNGER.         247 "The law may accuse him of a crime, but it does not, pronounce him a criminal until it has found him guilty. And I 'll stake my life that Alfred Ethinger never com- mitted a crime." "If he is guilty, let him suffer the penalty of his mis- deeds; if innocent, let him extricate himself as' best he can.- Let him rot within the walls of a State prison. You shall not go to him, by my soul, you sha'n'tt - He raised his hand against me. I've never forgiven him, and time has granted me vengeance," he cried, clenching his fist in a passion.' "Father,"--her voice was clear and distinct as a silver- toned bell, and her eyes full of the soul-light it was use-  less for him to combat,-"I do not wish to disobey you, but were my brother the greatest criminal on the face of the earth, I would go to him. Years ago, I promised him my help and love should he ever be in distress of his own or another's making, solemnly promised; and now he has called upon me to fulfil the pledge, I cannot refuse. PI 'h keep my Word, and guilty or innocent, I am going-straight to Alfred as fast -as steam can take me." She did not, give him a chance to reply, nor did she utter a syllable regarding the whereabouts of her brother. She merely said, "I am going to Philadelphia," and with '  that she left him to prepare for her immediate departure.* Alone, Luke bowed his head and groaned aloud, his - bent body swaying to and fro, the thin gray hair faolling : over his hollow temples, and a horrible agony -working in  his face,-the agony of a fierce and fully awakened re-  morse a feeble, conscience-smitten old man. Aye, Luke -I Ethi ger was a being to be pitied now I  H len acquainted her mother with the startlng news   : as g ntly as she could. Keeping back-everything but    1 that Ahe had heard from Alfred,and that he was sick and    248     -HELEN ETHGER. wanted to see her. She knew her father would be silent, and Uitil she knew the worst, it was her wish to keep her mother in ignorance of Alfred's true situation. Indeed, there was no time for explanations, for she was going on the mid-day frain, and must be at the depbt in half an hour. Mrs. Ethinger and May hastened to assist her in getting ready, forgetting in part, their anxiety and curiosity in the hurry and excitement; bade her God speed on her sudden journey, and saw her depart with strangely heavy hearts. While the train was bearing Helen on towards the good Quaker city, an old man sat gloomily staring at the wall, and harshy muttering to himself: "In prison-- a villain -and he- is my son! a curse and a shame to me. I wish he had died, like my other boy, in his cradle." Luke was- yet stiffnecked, and would not see how gravely he had wronged his child. He still saw only Alfred's faults, blindly refusing to see his own. *?          ., HELEN ETHNGERo        249 CHAPTER XX'TII. ADRIFT. "FRED ETHNGER had no definite recollection juL of how he reached the village the night of his terrific encounter with his father. He only knew he ran with all his might, and never stopped until he jumped on board the train, and comprehended nothing of what he was doing till the shriek of the locomotive reminded him he was rapidly leaving the home of his boyhood, and plunging on through the darkness to his first struggle with the world. He had a slight acquaintance with the conductor,-as most village boys have who are in the habit of frequenting the depot at train time, as young Ethinger was, - and when he came through the car where he was sitting, the sharp official at once recognized the runaway, and from the lateness of the hour and the fugitive's excited appearance, guessed that something was wrong. "Halloo, youngster, what does this mean?" he interro- gated, setting down his lantern, and looking suspiciously at the twenty Alfred quietly offered in lieu of a ticket. i "Starting on your travels, eh? Where do you want a I ticket for?" Alfred felt a trifle simple. "I don't know. Clear through anywhere. I 've cut the gov'nor for good and all." "And was that a proper thing to do, my lad?"  "I could not help it. He is a rough old filibuster, you know, and there was nothing left but to up and dust." "He gave you a deuce of a thrashing, I presume." "He tried to ; but it's a draw which got the worst of . *.      i    250  '   HELEN ETHNGERo it. I 'll take a black eye any time in a fair fight; but to stand up and take, and give the odds, because he is your father, won't do. I left mother and the girls frightened half to death, and Helen--that's my oldest sister-- tipped me the twenty." His words were flippant and slangy, but his voice was almost tearful, and his kind-hearted interlocutor did not fail to notice it. "Well," said the conductor, extenuatingly, " one can't stand no more than he can. I had a hard father myself, and slipped off of a moonlight night, without taking the trouble to tell him I was going. There is a fellow on board from up the country-a cattle-buyer and drover. He 's got a lot of stock coming on the Pennsylvani"CTen- tral, and he might employ you till you get over the flurry, and look about a little. I just left him in the smoking- car. You wait here until we pass the next station, and I 'll bring him around." With this friendly bit of comfort, the conductor went out to attend to his duties. 'The station passed and the train again under way, he returned, according to promise, with Mr. Styles, the drover, and that stout individual read- ily agreed to hire the lad, and in his peculiar phraseology suceinctly imparted his decision. "I 've got two or three hundred head booked for the Philadelphia market, and I'll need a boy to drive 'em in. Ticket him through to the Junction, conductor, and I 'll pay his expenses after that." Whereupon the conductor took his fare to the Junction, handed Alfred back the change, and in an incredibly short time Mr. Ethinger's renegade son found himself a drover's boy, and fairly adrift in the world. Considering the business settled, Mr. Styles and the conductor went away, and Alfred curled himself up on   HELEN  ETHNGER,       251 the seat and tried to sleep. But close his eyes ever so tight, he could not shut out the white horror of his moth- er's face, nor the wild pity and affright of Helen's im- ploring eyes. He could not banish the vision of an old man lying prostrate at his feet, and the mad parricidal fury that struck him down. They haunted him all night, and the going without his supper also troubled him. The gnawings of conscience and the gnawings of hunger are fatal to the staunchest courage, and Alfred arrived at the Junction feeling very dispirited, tired, and hungry. He revived a little as the morning advanced, and Styles had seen to it that he had a good breakfast; so he was not so badly off for a runaway; and by noon, mounted on a shuffling, long-haired pony, he was on his way to Phila- delphia, and taking his first lesson in droving. For three weeks he traversed the dusty, unfamiliar country roads, shouting, heading off, and turning back a multitude of unruly cattle, and winning golden opinions from the sturdy Styles. It was a novel and not unpleasant occupation, and Alfred congratulated himself on being a very fortunate boy. The weather was fine, the transit slow and easy, and a different prospect every day. At night they stayed. at country taverns or hospitable farm-houses,-buying cattle. all the way; so that by the time they reached the end of their journey, the drove had increased nearly one-half more than it was at starting. They arrived at Philadelphia on a bright morning, and when the cattle were properly secured, and he had no further need of an assistant, Mr. Styles said 1"Good-bye, my lad," handed Alfred a ten-dollar note, and coolly walked off. He was done with him; he had no longer any use for his services. And Styles thought the ten dol- lars a munificent remuneration, taking ifo a-ceouat his   252      HELEN -ETHNGER. expenses for the three weeks he had employed him. He was not a man to put himself out in the smallest to oblige anybody. He was kind so far as kindness affected his business, but he never went out of his way to do another a good turn. He paid the boy, treated him well while with him, and did not bother himself about who he was, where he came from, or what might become of him. Alfred knew his stay with the drover was only tempo- rary, merely extending to getting the cattle to the city, so he said good-bye in return, pocketed the money, and sallied out to take a look at the Quaker metropolis, and see if he could find work, The prim brick houses, all of an unvarying red and white, with their forbidding shutters jealously closed to  exclude the possibility of a- ray of light, looked very queer to him. The methodical white steps and immaculate doorways were all alike, and the unchanging monotony of that endless array of white and red suggested the funny thought that the prim houses were all in uniform, and quietly awaiting orders to march. Compact regi- ments and whole brigades of patriotic dwellings in stern regimentals, and standing in solid military procession, met his eye at every turn. The sentinels of the suburbs first attracted his wondering attention, then the outposts and pickets claimed his notice; and when he came to the long, impenetrable phalanx that denoted the heart of the city, he had arrived at the conclusion that red and white wasthe established law in Philadelphia, and, those man- sions not thus designated were excommunicated from re- spectable architecture. Alfred gave the first day to his curiosity, and wandered from street to street, staring in show-windows and watch- ing the ceaseless rush of the crowds of people. He saw a great 'many strange sights, and heard a great many A,  --        t      HELEN ETHNGER.          253 strange sounds that day, and slept at night he knew not- where. A sign hanging outside the door of a mean-look- ing house in a narrow, noisy street, told the passer-by that lodging could be obtained within for fifty cents, and Alfred availed himself of the invitation. The mingled odors of garlic and Limburger cheese strongly denoted it to be a German habitation of humble aspirations; but Alfred managed to spend the night there, and arose in the morning refreshed for the day's adventures. He was not unacquainted with the exterior of what are called drinking-saloons, and knew pretty well the class of society that frequented them. There was one of the kind at Bergen, and he had seen altogether too much of its internal evil. He knew the sign manual of those places in town or city, for .the outward resemblance does not greatly differ anywhere. They are generally situated on a corner, the lower half of the windows is painted white, to baffle the prying eyes of too officious policemen, per- haps, and a high screen, usually of a lively green color; stands just within before the always open door. And there is sand on the floor, and a scraping of heavy feet, and boisterous laughter, and oysters in the shell piled on one end of the counter, and a' young man behind the bar in his shirt-sleeves, and wearing an enormous diamond pin. The saloon at Bergen, if not so extensive, was none the less boisterous than the one Alfred stumbled on in Philadelphia. There were the same allurements of lemons, decanters, and coatless young man, and dice, and cards, and lager, and oysters, and drunken men, and promiscuous fights and broken heads. These drinking dens are not confined to the seething scums of the. city; they shoot up quite as thriftily and viciously in the country, the smallest village boasts its " saloon;" and it is there that-bright, clever boys like Alfred Ethinger begin their course of wild dis- 22              ^   *   254      HELEN ETHNGER. sipation, whicih,.at first harmless and participated in with no evil intent, leads to - heaven only knows what. -Alfred pausdd- before this corner-saloon of a great, strange city, and wondered what fun vas -going o0A behind the portentous green screen. He'd go in just for a min- ute,-only. a minute, - and seer what it was like. He felt a little lonesome, and it would cheer him up. His foot was *on the door-sill--just a minute. No; I promised Helen I'd keep out of those places, and I won't make a liar of myself with her." He resolutely stepped back to the side-walk, and sauntered from the dangerous locality the master of one temptation at least. After wandering around for several hours, he came to a part of the city where the streets were blocked up by trucks and express-wagons, and all sorts of business vehicles; and, among other things, he saw posted in the window of a large warehouse the cheering announcement, "Boy wanted: inquire at the office." Was not this his opportunity? It might be exactly the situation for him. It was the wholesale provision and forwarding house of Lovejoy and McNally; three or four brawny men, by aid of a huge rope, were hoisting a great variety of boxes and barrels to the upper floors. Alfred stopped, and for some time took--note of their work. Having seen a dozen bar- rels ascend, and, while the laborer was waiting for the rope to return for another hoist, he boldly accosted the sturdy Irishman. "Will you please inform me where the office is, sir?" The Celt motioned with his thlmb over his shoulder. "Jist inside; the man wid the rid head." Alfred followed the direction indicated by the grimy thumb, and entered the store. .Partitioned off in one cor- ner was a sort of office, and behind' the dusty railing sat i    '    HELEN ETHNGER.         255 a red-headed gentleman, rapidly filling out printed bills of lading. He glanced at Alfred, - a mere lifting of his left, eye-lid,--and kept on writing, taking, as it seemed, scarcely any notice of hifn. Young Ethinger was by no means a boy of common- place appearance, even in adverse circumstances; and the furtive look of the red-headed gentleman's left eye did not disconcert him in the smallest. His clothes, though" not improved by three weeks' droving, were not shabby, and his bright black eyes, dark hair, and full open brow, were decidedly prepossessing. "I saw your notice in the window, and came to see if I could obtain the place," said he, in a clear, straight for- ward manner. The gentleman behind  the railing left off writing, placed the pen between his teeth while adjusing the papers, and looked at the applicant sharply. "Parents live in the city?" slightly guttural, from the pen-holder he was making of his teeth. "No, sir." "Know anything about the city?" "Not much." "How long you been here?" "Hardly two *days." "Write a fair hand?" "Yes, sir." "Hum: quick at figures?" "I was called so at school." !"Give us a specimen of your handwriting." He tossed him a   scrap of paper, and pointed to the pen and ink-, stand without the sacred railing. Alfred took up-the pen, wrote his name, and handed back the scrap of paper. "Alfred Ethinger: first-rate, plain as print. Where does your father live?"   HELEN' ETHNGER. "I have no father, sir ; mentally qualifying the equivo- cal assertion by a grim retrospect of the way in which he became fatherless. "Where did you come from ?" suspiciously. "From  the country.  I've been droving for three weeks; came in yesterday with five hundred head. Be- fore I lost my father, I lived at home, and I had no need to seek employment." "You seem to be a very intelligent lad for your age; don't you like droving ?" " No, not for a steady employment. It does very well for a month or so, when there is nothing better to do; but I 've a rather good education for a poor boy, and there is little use for it in that business. Any lad that can ride an old pony, and yell pretty loud, will do for a drover." The red-headed gentleman smiled faintly, took the pen from his mouth, and emerged from behind the railing. "You stay here until I go up and see Mr. Lovejoy." He disappeared up a pair of long, dirty stairs, where Mr. Lovejoy,: no doubt, held prouder state than his clerk below.  The young man came back presently, and a less astute lad than Alfred might have observed that his decision was likely to be affirmative. "You may be a young rascal, for all I know; but you are just the boy we want, if you are honest and willing to make yourself useful. Mr. Lovejoy has concluded to try you; says you may sleep in the store with the watchman, and get your meals where you please. Got any money?" "Yes; Mr. Styles paid me, and I had some besides." "-Who is Mr. Styles ?" " Why, the drover." "Ah, yes, I see. Well, where can this Styles the drover be found ?"    -HELEN ETHINGER.   257   "At the cattle-yards, I suppose. I left him there." "All right. Go over there to Murphy, he'll set you to work." Alfred was at once taken-in charge by Murphy of the soiled thumb, and under his curt but kindly orders began to roll boxes and barrels and casks like the rest, if not with as much celerity, at least with as much willing-, ness. Meanwhile, the shrewd clerk returned to his desk be- hind the railing, quickly wrote a note, called Patrick the porter and gave it to him, with minute directions to go immediately to the cattle-yard, hunt up one Mr. Styles, a drover, who was likely to be found there, de- liver the note to him, and await an answer. This Patrick faithfully did, and returned with the dro- ver's reply. Mr. Styles did not hesitate to say that he thought Master Alfred a smart, trusty boy; met him on the train; conductor knew him; said he was a sharp, clever lad. Had no fault to find with him; did his work well without grumbling. Could not be bad, nor nothing so very wrong, because the conductor told him his sister had furnished the money for him to start with. This ex- planation satisfied the clerk, and Alfred was exalted to entire confidence and favor in the Lovejoy and McNally firm. The large, dusty, noisy warehouse became the field of his labors, and he tried, by hard work and constant activity, to forget the miserable act that had driven him an alien from home and wounded so deeply the heart of his mother. 22*    258     HELEN ETHNGER. CHAPTER XXTV. MY SISTER Hit ERN. ALFRED was returning from the bank, one morning, where he had been on an errand for his employers, when an incident occurred that eventually changed the whole tenor of his life, and definitely shaped the course of his future career. He chanced to carelessly glance into the superb show-window of a large picture-store on Chestnut Street as he-briskly walked along that magnificent thoroughfare, and the painting he saw instantly riveted his attention. The window was full of all sorts of beau- tiful -and costly pictures of every size and description, but he saw only one of that vast and valuable collection. He stopped, and looked at it with his heart in his eyes; and the gaze was so intense and singularly yearning that a gentleman, who happened to be passing at the moment, noticed it,-and halted to see what there could be in the picture to so visibly affect an errand-boy. "Not Happy!"-' that was the picture Alfred was looking at. The written card above it bore but the two words, the painting told the rest, and before he hardly knew, the tears were slowly rolling down his cheeks and his lips quivering like a girl's. Poor Alf, with all his temper and self-will, was still only a boy, and could yet cry over his heart-memories if he thought nobody saw him, and he really had no idea that he was being observed. The stranger, interested as well as surprised, could not forbear addressing him, and said very kindly, and in, a tone of inquiring sympathy: "What is there about that picture to so strongly move   HELEN ETHNGER.          259 you, my lad. You seem to recognize in it a familiar recol- lection of what ' Not Happy' literally means?" Alfred started, ashamed of his tears, hastily brushed them away, and stammered: "I beg pardon; did you speak, sir?" "And I beg pardon for intruding on your thoughts," -replied the stranger. "Not altogether a work of surpass- ing merit; but there is in that picture a certain depth of soul and understood sadness calculated to touch an older heart than yours, and you need not be ashamed of the feeling it produced." "And it should touch mine, because my sister painted it," he said, with a glow of pride. "Your sister?" "Yes, my sister Helen. I never saw it before, but I am sure she painted it, for I see in it that which was a part of our childhood." "If the artist is your sister, you ought to be proud of her, for she is a genius." "She is more than a genius, sir. She is the best woman I ever knew# And in his earnest praise the brother was unconscious that he had spoken a noble truth. The stranger held out his hand. "You are a boy worthy of so good a sister. Do you care to tell me something more of your home and this gifted sister?" Alfred took the warmly offered hand, but hesitated what reply to make. "I don't know, sir. It wasn't a happy home. Mother, as I look back to it now, always seemed heart-broken, and we -- that is Hattie and I, gave her lots of trouble. There are five of us, that's our number in the picture; and you can see for yourself the rest better than I can tell you."   160     HELEN ETHNGER.              ":Yes; it is all very plain. The mother crying alone in the midnight silence and gloom; the children all asleep, but that slender little girl creeping to her from the bed." "That is Helen; and she has such wonderfully sweet brown eyes. - I never could do a wicked thing when they were looking at me. She saved me from being a bad. boy; but I forget I am speaking to a stranger." He suddenly checked himself, confused at having said so much to one entirely unknown to him, and made a mo- tion to leave the window, but the stranger gently detained him. "Stay, my lad, your confidence is not unworthily placed, nor are we quite' strangers. I have seen you many times at the     National Bank; and I am not a person to forget a face that interests me, as yours did the first time I saw it, although, I confess, I hardly knew it transformed by the tender feeling it expressed while you were looking at the picture. My name is Stephen Cassard, one of the,   National Bank directors, and I should like to advance your fortunes, if I coeld, in some way equal to your ability, for I am satisfied you are a boy of no -ordinary promise; rightly assisted at the beginning, you might make a man of whom the city hereafter will bb emulous to claim as her own."         - "Are you indeed Stephen Cassard ? I have heard my employer, Mr. Lovejoy, speak of you~ but I never so much as dreamed of ever meeting you like this," said Alfred, looking in wonder at the gravely kind features of the rich bank director. It is no difficult matter to win the confi- dence of youth, and Mr. Cassard soon knew all about Alfred's adventures as a drovers boy, and his subsequent falling in with-his present employers. He only kept back the manner of his leaving home; that was something he    HELEN  ETHNGER.        261 never mentioned to a living soul, and tried to forget him- self. When he had finished, Mr. Cassard was thoughtful a few moments, and finally said: " The warehouse is not the right place for you. It is a business you will find dragging and irksome as you grow older, for I do not think it at all congenial to your taste. How would you like to go into a bank? I mean at the foot of the ladder, for in that business you must begin at the bottom and work up ?" "I'd like it very much better than the produce-house, sir, even at the foot of the ladder; but they have been kind to me,- Mr. Lovejoy took me in when I had noth- ing but my face to offer in pledge of my honesty (Alfred was ignorant of the cattle-dealer's terse credentials); and, although it is not what I should wish for a life-long occu- pation, I was glad to get it; and I could not think of leaving unless they are willing." " You are right, and I am more than ever pleased with you. However, I'11 see Mr. Lovejoy, for I have taken a great liking to you, and I am certain he has no desire to stand in the way of yjur interests. In the love you un- wittingly betrayed for your sister Helen, you won a sinM cere friend. I'11 not detain you longer; good-morning." The bank director walked away in the opposite direc- tion, leaving Alfred not a little mystified, and in doubt if he were in his proper senses. With a farewell look at the picture, and a secret determination to come back and see it again the first opportunity, Alfred turned from the lofty show-window of Tinsley Baxter & Co., and hurried off to the dusty produce-house,, walking very fast to make up for the time lost min contemplating Helen Ethinger's beautiful painting, and talking with the affable Mr. Cas- sard. The following Monday Mr. Cassard sought an inter-  262      HELEN ETHNGERo view with Mr. Lovejoy, and what they said Alfred never knew, but the conference ended in his being transferred to the employ of the  National Bank as speedily as he had abandoned droving for the wholesale produce business. Mr. Cassard's 'nfluence secured him a position in the bank, a very humble one it is true, virtually at the foot of the ladder,--but Alfred had that in him -that was adapted to climbing; and Mr. Lovejoy felt-really proud that he had a youth in his service esteemed of so much worth by a gentleman of Mr. Cassard's discernment. So he bade him adieu, heartily wished him success in his new sphere, and Alfred and his old employer, with mutual expressions of friendship and-good-will, amicably parted. There were no more barrels and casks for Alfred to roll, but there was an immense amount of exercise for his legs ! in-every part of the city. He commenced as a runner, and everybody who knows anything about banks knows   i what that is. He has to present drafts for acceptance and collection to all sorts of business-men up town and ' down town and across town, and he has to collect divi- -dends, coupons, rents, calls for istalments on railroad stock, and a hundred things beside. The runner must ex- pect to be snubbed by the teller, and never under any possibility must he be guilty of a mistake. When Alfred had passed through this necessary discipline, and knew all the ins and outs of the city, and had gained a pretty good insight into the business routine of banking affairs, he was promoted to the place of assistant book-keeper, and for the first time in nearly two years his legs got a com- plete rest, at the expense of his fingers, which were now getting acquainted with the ledger- and the system of entering the checks of the day, proving the books, and balancing accounts. Mr. Cassard became greatly attached to- him, and.,he-was-a-favorite with every one connected   HELEN ETHNGER.         263 with the bank. And he could not well be otherwise, for he was an active, obliging young fellow, who did his work faithfully, and never aspired to over-reach his superiors, or assume more than he could accomplish. Mr. Cassard was very wealthy and unmarried, his nearest relative being a nephew, of whom it was said- he was extremely fond, and had brought up with the care and tenderness of a son. This young gentleman, Mr. Bryant Delano, was just home from college, and his worst traits of character thus far developed were reckless extravagance and a passion for cards. He was penniless, except for the income allowed him by his uncle; but, being the presumptive heir of Mr. Cassard, he was prodi- gal and profligate in his expenditures and habits, relying on him for means wherewith to gratify his depraved excesses. -Bryant Delano finished his college course con- spicuous for nothing but his numerous scrapes and his well-earned reputation of a remarkably fast young man. Other than this, he was an indolent, good-natured, hand- some fellow, fond of riotous living, and, with his cham- : pagne and horses and ballet-girls and club-associates, he led, a dashing life of it the moment he was released from college, and was looked upon even by his wild companions as being a hopelessly dissipated youth.  He seldom came to the bank; and it was whispered among the employes that Mr. Cassard had sternly threat-- ened disinheritance, if his nephew did not speedily mend his ways and drop the bad company he was always to be found in.  Bryant Delano laughed at the rumor, hummed A"Go it while you are young," and conceitedly thoughtShimself a -pretty tolerably good sort of a fellow for, these -fast - days. He did not appear to be at all envious or jealous of his uncle's well-known liking for Alfred Ethinger; he   264      HELEN ETHNGER. was too indolent and shallow-brained for any deep emo- tion, and could not think earnestly and to a purpose, if he was to die.  "Only one of the old boy's whims," (Mr. Cassard was barely thirty-eight;) "guessed Alf was a clever sort of a kid, and would'do for the counting-house; but he was n't the genteel thing his uncle would be likely to waste money on to any great extent." But the complacent nephew had yet to learn that his uncle could be severe and inflexible as a rock in a just cause, and one morning Bryant Delano knew he could rely-no longer on his uncle for support. His mere living Mr. Cassard would pay,--for he could not see his sister's child starve; -but beyond that not a dollar need he ever expect from him. This. was a decision that greatly astonished the wild nephew, and to forget what he called his " deuced hard luck," he plunged deeper and deeper into every species of dissolute gayeties. - He never knew the value of money, nor how to honestly earn it; and when  stripped of his last shilling, he resorted to the card-table lin hope of bettering his fortune. He was no novice in a careless way, but now it was serious work, and his eager- ness and anxiety were that of a professional whose bread depends upon his luck. About this time important financial matters called Mr. Cassari to Europe, and for some weeks his nephew was lost sight of. How and where he lived nobody knew, and nobody seemed to care. Young Delano, in his uncle's absence, Was progressing down hill splendidly, and had nearly reached the bottom when the made the last and crowning venture that resulted in his utter ruin.   HELEN ETHNGER.         265 i        CHAPTER XXV. PERQUISITES. ONE afternoon, two months after Mr. Cassard's depart- ure for England, Alfred unfortunately happened to meet Delano as that elegant sybarite was gracefully strolling along Chestnut Street, and musing, no doubt, on his hard lot. No sooner did he see Alfred, than he called out in a familiar manner: I "Ah, good-afternoon, Alf; glad to meet you. Let's go in and have a lunch." They were opposite the Continental, and before Alfred could decline the invitation, he coolly put his hand on his arm and drew him in. There was no help for it, and he allowed himself to be conducted into the spacious dining- Toom, wishing he was anywhere else than in the company of Bryant Delano. A great many people were seated at the different tables, for both the hour and the place were the ne plus ultra of Philadelphia fashionables, and scores of sumptuously attired ladies and gentlemen filled the salon. Alfred noticed that young Delano selected the most re- tired table, which he shrewdly suspected was prelusive of confidence; and when they were seated, and he had given the waiter his order with the air of a crown-prince and the nonchalance of a cosmopolitan, he turned to Alfred, and candidly imparted the depleted state of his finances. "I 'm dead broke, Alf. Staked the/last dollar and lost an hour ago; so you will have to pay the shot." Alfred thought it a clever way of getting a free lunch, but he did not mind paying the shot. He was glad to 28 b   266     HELEN ETHNGER.             1 escape so easily, and prudently made no reply to his friend's burst of confidence. Mr. Delano resumed the conversation in much the same strain.. Leaning across the table, he asked in a confidential whisper: "I say, Alf; you could n't lend a fellow a twenty, could I you?"       , Alfred pondered, He was the nephew of his benefac- . tor, and when his face did not wear that forced, meaning- less smile, it looked haggard and troubled. Poor fellow, he was simple, lazy, and superficial, without either brains or energy to carry him through the world; and if a man had n't the Bense of an oyster, who could expect to dis- cover in him the-soaring qualities of the eagle. Alfred both pitied and despised him. He had no patience with his contemptible weakness and butterfly dandyism, but he could treat his actual wants generously. '-'Yes, I can lend you the amount. There, take it, and ! don't risk it on the chance of a card." Alfred handed him the money, and he carelessly twirled it into his vest-pocket quite as if it were a mere nothing. "Thanks! I'll return the, trifle in a day or two. I suppose you are getting to know the banking business pretty sharp by this time - understand the corners and the dodges outside, eh?" "I have my certain duties to perform, and know noth- ing about outside corners and dodges," said Alfred, coldly. "Ah, yes; discreet, I see. Lucky thing for you when my old man took you up. He -wanted to hoist me on a stool in the counting-room, but I kicked the proposition to the devil on the start; and he knew better than bother a me with it afterwards. Never make any extras, do you?" "Extras I 'What may that mean?" ' Why, private emoluments." "'! amX paid Ja defite salary; and. there is no way I F4   . .                    .i   HELEN ETHNGER.         267 could make' extra emoluments,' unless I were a thief, and I hope you don't think me that," replied Alfred, looking at him with a hotly flushing brow and a sparkle of indig- nation in his honest eyes. "Oh, Lord, no; not a thief, d-n it,--what an ugly word, - but you know there are perquisites. All sorts of business transactions are more or less a cheat and a swin- dle, and those high and mighty bank officers of yours are no exception, I can tell you." Alfred did, not offer a reply. It was not the kind of conversation that suited him, and the waiter opportunely appearing at the moment with a loaded tray, he was saved from responding. Lunch, as Bryant called the very sub- stantial dinner he ordered, was partaken of in silence, and when finished, he threw down his napkin and drew a little from the table, as men do who meditate confi- ding to another some important information,that other being a trifle obstinate and inclined to reticence. "Here, John, check!" lightly tapping the marble sur-  - face of the table to call the wandering attention of the waiter, and if he had had the wealth of the Rothschilds at -his back, he could not have spoken more like a million- naire. John brought the check. Mr. Delano graciously tossed it over to Alfred, and John, knowing he was done with that table, politely retired. "Speaking of perquisites," resumed the courteous Mr. Delano, going back to the subject in a moralizing tone, "since the old boy whittled me down to a mere pittance, I've been devilishy hard pushed. Thought he'd relent before this, but he keeps as mum as a mouse in a closet. Yes, perquisites, as I was saying. .Now, a fellow, Sharp and up to the business, ought to -be able to ^ handle funds with no loss to the bank and great gain to'  J'   268      HELEN ETHNGER. /       - himself. Intrinsically, there-should be a margin allowed for perquisites, and no harm in it, either. But when is the old chap expected home?" "-Not for some weeks, I believe." "That's deuced annoying. I'm infernally low in cash and credit just now. If he was only here, I'd promise reformation, End that would fetch him." The hopeful nephew sighed, and looked at the wall in an injured way, as if he felt himself illy used. Alfred maintained a chilling silence that would have frozen the confidence of anybody but the impervious Mr. Bryant: Delano. The impecunious man 'of fashion was so intent on sounding the book-keeper that he failed to see how entirely -his sentiments wuEre unreciprocated by his distrustful friend. Again bending towards him with that insinuating smile and mellow modulated whisper, he significantly questioned: "Never go in for perquisites, -eh, Alf?" "I shall certainly never go in for dishonesty in any guise," said -Alfred, forcibly; " and the person that takes me for a:sco ndrel is in danger of being roughly made aware of his insulting mistake. I'm no deliberate vil-e lain, I' d have you to know, Mr. Delano; and I'll thank you to- remember it, when you venture to suggest extra emoluments and outside perquisites to me." Alfred's black eyes were upon the languid tempter in Searching aLger and abhorrence, and so. clear and con- demning was the look, that he thought it best to treat the whole matter as a joke. Leaning back, he laughed con- strainedly, as if very much amused at his earnestness. "Whew! iwhat a fire all for nothing! And how pat you are with your 'thief,' and ' villain,' and scoundrel! ' Bah, what a scurrilous complication of vile sounds! Yotu, of course, are the very personification of unim-   I       HELEN ETHNGER.       269 peachable integrity. You never did a thing to be ashamed of, I 'll warrant; and I'll wager you never will. Why, I 'd as soon suspect an angel of embezzlement, as even to so much as hint that the worthy favorite of my respected uncle could by any possibility be induced to speculate a little on his own hook. I like your simplicity, hanged if I don't!, it's so refreshing in this corrupt age; but, I say, what's your name; it will slip my mind,--Alf Ethington?" "Ethinger," corrected Alfred, preparing to go. "Just scratch it down, will you; I am the deuce to remember names. Much obliged; now, when my memory fails, I 'll be able to renew it by positive evidence." He carefully put the bit of paper on which Alfred had hurriedly scribbled his name in his pocket, and sauntered out on the side-walk. There they parted; but the chance meeting cost Alfred Ethinger dear. He felt convinced that the less he had to do with Bryant Delano .the better for himself His ambiguous laugh, and queerly uttered "perquisites, kept ringing in his ears all the way to tha bank, and he wished from his soul he had never heard it. Exactly one week from that inauspicious encounter ;with young Delano, Alfred was unexpectedly summoned to an audience with Mr. Mellick, the -president of the bank. He was busily engaged at his desk when informed of the president's request; but he quickly responded to the message, closed the heavy ledger, and repaired at once to the directors' room, where he found Mr. Melick and half-a-dozen of the bank officers, all looking very grave, and evidently awaiting his presence with deep concern,                   - ) "Mr. Ethinger," said the president, pointing to a paper on the table before him4, "do you know that hand- writing?" 'A  29 *   270.     HELEN ETHNGER. Alfred looked at it, and unhesitatingly replied, "Yes, sir; it is mine." "Then, young man, you are not only an ingrate, but a forger, and a- criminal.' ' What I " Alfred stepped back, and stared at the president in proud, resentful astonishment.  "You acknowledge this to be your handwriting?" said the president, immovable as a rock. . Alfred bent a swift, searching glance on the -paper, perceptibly paling when he clearly comprehended its nature; but his voice was steady, and his black eyes lowered not a whit  "I can swear on oath, sir, that I never wrote the body of that note; but I cannot swear that it is not my signature." "A rather doubtful statement, young man. You will   have to. make it plainer." "I cannot make it plainer. But Mr. Lovejoy will never believe me guilty of using his name in this base manner, for, before high heaven, my conscience is clear of the deed."  "I hope you will be able to prove it so, but. now the evidence is-that you are guilty, and I can do no less than hand you over to the law." Alfred dropped his head, cut to the heart, and the bit- terness of- a mighty injustice warring in his soul. The shrlting was only momentary. His was a spirit to com- bat to the death a wrong; at least, he would not sink under it, He lifted his head'proudly, looked around him in a slow, firm way, and said, in a deep, impressive voice, ' Do as you will; I am powerless to hinder; but I am in- nocent, and the right will triumph. I find that the fidelity of years is not sufficient to disarm the suspicions ,        ' *,     ^    HELEN  ETHNGER.        271 of a moment, and my past unblemished record avails me nothing in this hour of distrust." "You will be justly dealt with; and were you my own son, I would not be a jot the more lenient," returned the president, stern as judgment, itself, and 'his gray eyes severe and determined as ever a {bank president's could be. "We have just discovered that Mr. Lovejoy's name has been forged to a large amount, -nearly five thousand dollars; the worthless paper was cashed, and the bank of course must bear the loss. Your former employer admits, despite your avowed signature, that he cannot conscien- tiously accuse you of being the guilty party; but it is my duty to ascertain the truth. A moment'qmlptation has destroyed the integrity of years, and I have not to learn the fact to-day. I am sorry for you, deeply sorry, and regret the false step you have taken. You are young, and your intelligence, far superior to that of most young men, promised you a useful and enviable career, and'I had hoped to see you turn out better." Alfred could not crush the haughty spirit that rose up within him. He felt'outraged, humiliated, and wounded,. and he never would bear a wrong, even if it was uninten- tional, meekly. He looked his austere accuser straight in the eye, folded his arms, and drew a long, full respira- tion, "Mr. Mellick, some day you will repent the- irredeem- able injustice of this hour." "And if I do, I 'll pledge-myself to do all in my power to repair the error," quickly interposed the president. Alfred's eyes were oddly wide and penetrating for a forger, Ind the discerning banker began to think there might be I mistake somewhere. "You can never repair an error of this kind; no after- avor can do it; guilty or innocent, you have ruined me   272.     HELEN  ETHNGERo completely, and the only thing I; have left is a right to defend my liberty and save myself, perhaps, from years of imprisonment." "And that you shall have," said one of the directors, coming forward. "You may rely on my friendship and -asistance, let the result be what it may." "Thank you, sir, for the kind assurance, but I am not friendless; I am not alone. There is one who will find a way -to help me out of this, clear up the doubts, believe in and defend me against the world; for she said so, and she never broke her word. I shall rely on the love and faith of my sister Helen." The boy's face was grand when he said it, and a smile of defiance came out on his lips, and a gleam of exulta- tion deadened the piercing reproach of his eyes, Not one of those present believed in their hearts he was guilty, but the evidence was so strong against him, there was no other way but to let the law take its course, and that night Alfred Etlinger was an inmate of the city prison. His father's prediction was verified. The diso- bedient son: was in jail, and the name of Ethinger regis- tered in the prison books. Locked in his cell like a common felon, and surrounded-by every type of hardened wretches, Alf6d tried in vain to sleep. He fancied he could feel his mother's tears wet on his cheeks, and hear her softly crying, as she used to- do in the old days at home, when she crept to his bedside to kiss him in his sleep and silently share his troubles, Helen's brooding eyes, full of tender pity, kept watch above his rude pillow, and he seemed to- hear her soft, low voice sweetly-whisper through the gloom, Ts Under all circumstances, I will love and forgive you." Oh, Helen," he moaned, turning restlessly, on his narrow bed, "my life and heart and hope are broken, but   HELEN ETHNGER.         273 you are still my sister; not little Hattie, all beauty, laugh, and pleasure, but noble Helen, all gentleness, strength, and goodness. I did well to rely on you, and you will come, come to me in my disgrace and misery, and bring ) with you comfort and patience." He fell asleep at last with ler name on his lips. The prison walls vanished, her arms were about him, and he rested secure in her unfailing love and'brave devotion. The following morning his request for writing materials was complied with, and he wrote: "Helen, you said you would aid me in trouble whether of my own or another's making, and the time is come for me to claim your promise. Come, I want you --you, of all others! I am in prison, charged with committing a crime so infamous that it is impossible that I could ever do it. I am not guilty; but I've got to prove it, and you must assist me in so doing. Come to Philadelphia, - here to me in jail, a suspected forger,--and circumstances will determine the rest.          ALFRED." And this was the letter that Helen read on the porch in the bright June morning,- the letter that turned her heart cold and whitened her face to the gray hue of ashes; the letter, written from within the frowning walls of a prison and received amid the perfume of yellow honey- suckles in a tranquil country home, that sent her alone on that sad journey to Philadelphia.  I           : -  e   i,          ; ^I s          274      HELEN ETHNGERo. CHAPTER XXVI. MOYAMENSING. HELEN arrived in Philadelphia without accident; accepted the services of the first hackman who pre- sented himself, and ordered him to drive as fast as possi- ble to the city prison. The hackman looked blank. What on earth could such a girl as that be going to the city prison for? "What--a; did you say Moyamensing? It's a good mile, miss." "No, I did not; I said the city prison." The hackman smiled at her ignorance. "Oh, well, it's all one, whether you wants city prison, county prison, or Moyamensing. You 'll find the three in the same spot; but is it there ye want to go?" still un- certain of her knowing her own mind. "Yes. Did I not say it plainly? and please be so good as to-waste no more time in doubting it." The driver took the hint, shut the carriage-door, mounted the box, and drove at a rattling pace towards the prison, ^-He drew -up -with 'a flourish before the visitor's entrance, and held the door open for her to alight. "This is the place," nodding at the grim walls. "Am I to wait?" - "Yes." She walked along the stone pavement to the little iron door set smoothly in the solid wall, and, before she had time to knock, itiwas opened from withi and a man of pleasing address said:         ' \   HELEN ETHNGER;          275 "Any particular person you wish to see, or simply a visitor ?" "I came to see my brother," she said, glancing down the row of grated windows facing the court-yard, as if his eyes must be watching for her from some one of them. The doorkeeper looked at her curiously; she did not belong to the ordinary class of women who came there to see their brothers. He pitied the poor girl; there was such a tired, lonesome expression in her pale, sweet face, and civilly bade her take a seat in the office while he called Mr. Stratton. A gentleman writing at a desk in one corner politely laid aside his pen and handed her a  chair. Helen bowed in acknowledgment of the civility and her eyes fell to the bit of sunlight wanly flickering on the stone floor. Opposite her, on a bracket fastened against the wall, was the bust of a murderer, modelled an hour after he was hanged, and this cheerful work of art was kept in countenance by a sculptured hand, being a part of the aforesaid murderer, and the one that sent death to his hapless victims. Helen did not understand the ghastly significance of the brutal, almost idiotic, head and horribly distorted features. She was too full of her own sorrows to notice anything closely, and she sat quite still, looking at the sunbeam, but never seeing it, and vaguely wondering if Alfred would know' her, if he were greatly changed; Prisons of the nineteenth century are not at all like those of the Middle Ages, but many people still cling- to the idea that modern penitentiaries are damp, cavernous, gloomy piles with a vast labyrinth of dark, musty cells, dingy, noisome corridors and deep, mysterious, rat- infested dungeons, where the light of day never pene. trates. They fancy ponderous doorsi, huge keys, and bolts    276     HELEN ETHNGERo and bars and chains everywhere, and satanic-visaged officials, savage and argus-eyed, posted at every turn. Of a- truth Helen fostered some such fallacy, and was a little surprised to discover nothing of the kind when brought face to face with the supposition. 'Massive walls, and long, narrow, iron-barred windows, and securely locked- doors, it is true. But there was plenty of light and air; and the large yard was- brilliant with flowers, and green with gracefully trellised vines, and neatly ar- ranged grass-plots, A mocking-bird warbled its velvet notes from a gilded cage close by, and a pair of gay little canaries trilled their pretty love melody across the flowers up to the narrow windows, where every grade of felon listened wistfully to their song. The music of birds, the soft tinkle of a fountain, and the prodigal fra- grance of a thousand blossoms were there. A   yellow honeysuckle was clambering up its lattice-support, and crimson June roses were gayly nodding in the breeze. And this was the enclosure of a prison -where bad men were brought for punishment, and good men were some-  times unjustly incarcerated. But very rarely unjustly; they were, for the most- part, men of evil heart and eye and deed, whose crimes were unknown and unnumbered, well as the law professed to judge them. Mr., Stratton now appeared,-a person of considera- ble authority, if the stress the doorkeeper gave his name was-of any significance, and startled Helen by the busi- n ess-like interrogative: -"Well, young lady, what can I do for you?" "I am Alfred Ethinger's sister. Can I see him?" H Hum " reflectively. "Yes, I recollect; the young forg--, gentleman, awaiting his trial. Of course you can see him. This way, if you please; he is in one of the upper cells, I believe."   HELEN ETHNGER.         2" "Number ten, second gallery," laconically instructed the man at the desk. "That's it; only one pair of stairs. Shall I assist you? Don't be alarmed; he is not likely to- be here long," en- couraged the kind-hearted official, offering his hand to help her up the stairs. Helen was trembling violently, and the great brown eyes were lighting up a face white and nerveles as marble. "I have not seen him for a long, long time, and then- please go slowly, for I am. very tired, very tired," she faintly said, and the woman, pallid as a snow-wreath, reached out a cold, powerless hand to stay herself from falling. "Good heavens! tired?   You are .fainting!" cried Mr. Stratton, catching her in time to prevent her sinking to the floor. "Here, Milford! water; quick "The gen- tleman at the desk below rushed up-stairs responsive to the hasty call, and together they succeeded in reviving the fatigued, unhappy girl. The overtasked brain and heart gave way at the last moment, and she could no longer fight off the stealthy unconsciousness that con- quered-her unaware. She opened her eyes with a  wan smile, and. endeavored to apologize for the weakness which for her life she could not help. "I am better, thank you. It was only a passing faintness. I have travelled some distance, and he is my only brother." She was so nobly beautiful, and so true a lady in every word and movement, that both gentlemen looked at her in admiring wonder and sympathy. Mr. Milford went back to his desk, privately thinking the fellow in number ten was not so badly off at -the most, since he had, so lovely and devoted a sister-to stand by:him through thick and thin.  24   27?8      HELEN  ETHNGER. "Can I speak with him alone?" she asked, fearful of a denial. "Yes, but you will have to talk through the bars. You know you caa't go in his cell. - It's strictly against orders to let any one but counsel in. You understand, his lawyer." ; Is ,it?" the lonesome look was in her eyes again, and she sighed as another hope died. Mr. Stratton stopped before the low door of number ten. It was fastened with a padlock, and painted black. "Open it softly," she whispered, touching the waiden's arm with a hand white and chill as ice. "Open it softly, I pray;' for it will tell him I am here." The key turned in the lock, and without a sound the little door swung open. Beside the strong door, there was the double precaution  of broad iron bars; and though the birds were singing and the flowers blooming in the fair garden below, Helen felt to the innermost depths of her soul that this was a prison, where the only thing prized above all the riches in the world was the one thing denied --freedom. God's glorious free gift of earth and air and sky and the- fellowship of his kind.- The rudest nature asks that, and if refused him, with all his crimes fresh upon his hands, he is a creature to be sincerely pitied. on the bed, with his head resting on his arm, Alfred was sleeping as soundly as when h e was a child. A little glimmer of sunshine from the grated window, like a thread of gold, fell across the coarse pillow and brightly touched his dark rumpled hair, just as she had seen the moon- beams play about his head in the Iong, low nursery of the old home. ' Hush " she said, with a silencing gesture. "Don't wake him; let me look at him asleep."     HELEN ETHNGtER.         279 She knelt down before the iron bars, her eyes fixed yearningly on the quietly slumbering face of her brother, and in the gaze she seemed to read every impulse that had ever stirred his heart. (' Thank God, he is innocent I It needs no words to tell me so. No guilty conscience ever won so sweet and -oalm a rest as that." The young head dropped lower; the white brow rested against the pitiless bars, and the warden knew she was praying. He, involuntarily, lifted his hat, and a few " thirty days' men," dight offenders permitted the freedom of the gallery,) paused, every convict of them within seeing distance, and stood in a reverently humble attitude, sensible of the pure spirit among them, and religiously respecting it, ignorant, uncouth, and vicious 'as they might be. Helen arose, cast a fond, lingering look at the tranquil sleeper, and sadly motioned her kind conductor to shut the door.              - Mr. Stratton was surprised. "Are you not going to speak to him?           :" "No, not now. - I could not in this place, and with these cruel bars between us. Tell him I've been here, when he wakes, -his sister Helen; and that she will find a way to help him." She was more a woman of action than words, and with / Alfred in prison, it was not for her to be idle. The offi- ial was a man quick to discern this, and at once piloted her back to the street entrance. She thanked him for-his courteous attention, resumed her seat in the carriage, and for full five minutes sat buried in the deepest thought. The driver placidly waited her instructions, indifferent as to where he was ordered to drive-next, for undoubtedly he knew the city well. So Helen concluded, and called 'him to her.   280      IELEN  ETTINGER. ' Could you take me to the office of a lawyer, - Mr. :A Churchill,-a gentleman of considerable distinction in hisrofession? I do not know the number or locality, buti yom perhaps may be able to find it." ^"lNet easier, miss; the city directory will tell you all about it." "And where can the city directory be found?" she asked, looking puzzled. '* Oh, a'most anywhere; over there in that drug-store, I guess. It 's a book as has the names and places of busi- ness pretty much of all the residents as are anybody, and you 'd be apt to find the number of this lawyer - what's his name?--among 'em. Jes give it me on a bit of -paper, and I 'll go over and see."-  Helen was greatly relieved by the lucid explanation. i She thought the "city directory" might be some high  i municipal functionary, who would detain her another hour; and- time was precious if she hoped to see the lawyer that day. Blessing, in her heart the rough but obliging  hackman, she hastily wrote the name, and despatched  him to the drug-store in quest of the desired information. He soon returned, smiling his success. "All right;  Walnut Street. I 'll have you there in no- time." And for coach horses they did make excellent speed. The carriage stopped opposite a large, brick building on Walnut Street, that had a great many signs gracing the entrance, explanatory of the professions conducted within. Real estate, advertising agency, job printing, notary public, and conspicuous among the more important an- nouncements was that-of "A. Churchill, attorney and counsellor-at-law. Third floor, room 5." Helen handed the hackman his fare, dismissed him, and stood alone in the great doorway. The stairs seemed in-   HELEN ETHNGER.         281 terminable; the rooms, although numbered, numberless, all opened from dark, dusty landings that, to one not accustomed to the sinuous passages, were painfully sugges- tive of a suddenly broken head. Helen judiciously began the long ascent slowly, and gained the third floor a little short of breath, but otherwise safely. Room 5, painted on a piece tf disguised tin, guided her to the right apartment. Not knowing the rules of etiquette governing law offices, the propriety of knocking appeared debatable ground, and she hesitated in what manner to present herself. A. Churchill, attorney and counsellor-at-law, had been her lover; was still her friend, but would he not think her unwomanly. A blush warmed the paleness of her brow, but Alfred, alone in his cell, was depending on her for help. That reflection decided her, and she gave a timid rap on the door of No. 5. Silence as profound as the grave.  Another, a little louder. Still silence. Rap number three yet louder than the last. Continued silence in No. 5, but a voice, proceeding from a head thrust over the balustrade above, volunteered the generous advice: "Walk right in, madam; if Churchill's out, you will find his office-boy around somewhere," and the head re- sumed its upward journey, carefully directing a pair of feet that were laboriously striving to gain the fifth story. Helen acted upon the charitable instruction of the un- known pilgrim, and without more ado opened the door. The sound awoke a diminutive office-boy from a comfort- able snooze, and he stared at the fair intruder in drowsy bewilderment. "I would like to see Mr. Churchill, if you please," said Helen, glad it was a sleepy boy, and not the lawyer : 24*    2 82     HELEN ETHNGER; she confronted, anxious as- she was to meet, Asa and obtain his counsel.                "He a'n't in; gone over to court, and won't be back fur -an hour," rubbing his eyes crossly, and wishing she, wouldlet him sleep in peace. "Can I wait?   "In course you can; there 's a chair," he replied, push- ing towards her a leather-covered arm-chair. Then he curled up again in the one he was occupying when she entered, folded his arms on the desk before him, laid his head on them, in place of a pillow, and gently composed himself to a renewaln of his interrupted nap. There was the usual office furniture peculiar to legal chambers, and, in the usual awkward positions, stiff chairs and desk and table, a case of severe-sized books bound in judicial calf, a rusty grate half full of torn papers, and dingy windows that never knew the cleansing virtues of water or dust-brush. Helen counted and recounted every article in the room to the subdued music of the office-boy's juvenile snore, and when both the counting and respiratory melody be- came monotonous, she picked -up the morning paper, lying crumpled on the table at her elbow, and listlessly glanced over the columns. Almost the first paragraph that met her eye was this: "Young Ethinger the forger, after a preliminary ex- amination, before Judge Rivington, was remanded back to prison. His trial is set down for npxt Thursday; there is hardly a doubt of his guilt." Helen dropped the paper as if an asp had stung heR, and, did not read another line, A quick step on the stair; the door opened and shut all in a second, and she turned her head to look in Asa Churchill's anly face once more.,   HELEN  ETHNGER.        283 "Miss Ethinger! Why, what a surprise." He cordially extended his hand, and took a seat near her. It was Asa, the boy lover of her childhood, but so different that she shrank from him almost as- if he had been a stranger. He was tall, bearded, and deliberate, with the business ring in his step and voice, and looking every inch the shrewd, successful lawyer. He noticed her embarrassment, and said, with the old  fond smile and kind, encouraging tone: "Sorrowful, patient, and self-sacrificing yet, I suppose, else I would not be speaking to Helen Ethinger?" "It is a great sorrow that brings me to you, the greatest trouble of my life--that has not been a too happy one. Read that, Mr. Churchill, and it will save me the pain and humiliation of a longer explanation." She handed him the paper, and anxiously watched his face while he read it. "Gracious heaven, Helen; do you mean' to say-" "I mean to say that young Ethinger the forger is my brother."                          : "Your brother?" "Ay-e, my brother /" "Are you sure it is Alfred. It seems to me incredible. His vices were never of that sort," said the lawyer, trying:  to disbelieve his own convictions. "I am not mistaken. It is Alfred; I have just come from his prison-cell. I saw him there, locked in like;a caged inimal; think of it, my only brother confined like a wild )east. He never committed the crime of which he is ac- cused. Never I but his innocence must be proved. You tre a lawyer; you have talent, knowledge, and experi- nce, and I am  here to ask your help in his behalf. )h, Asa Churchill, if you ever thought kindly of me,  ave this miserable boy; rescue my unfortunate brother    HELEN .ETHNGER. *! from this dreadful peril, and shield the name I bear from ineffaceable disgrace." She was pleading for more than life, and she forgot that the man she supplicated had loved her from his boy- hood. But Asa did not forget it, and took occasion to remind her of it in a covert way.  "Why, bless you, Helen, of course I'll do all I can for my old school-fellow, without your getting so terribly earnest about it. And did I not vow eternal allegiance to you and your troubles years ago amid the hum of the bee and the bloom of the thistle?" he spoke in a playful tone, but his eyes were serious, and he did not smile. Helen drew away, blushing and half afraid of him. He saw it, and was the man of business in a moment. "If I am a lawyer, Miss Helen, and you come to me for advice, to engage me as counsel for your brother, I must take hold of the case like a lawyer; we must come to plain facts at they appear, and whether guilty or inno- cent, I'll do the best I can for my client. Now tell me all you know, and I 'll draw my own inference." Helen's "all"was very little. She showed him Alfred's letter, which established his innocence in her opiiion. Asa was less credulous, for he knew that sisters are apt to be partial; a fact which Alfred might have discovered also. When Helen had finished her meagre recital, be- ginning with the letter and ending With her arrival at his office, she looked- up in his face with the simple con- fidence of a child,- as she used to do in the days when she was a little quiet, solemn-eyed girl, - and said: You will do the rest, now; won't you, Asa?" "Yes, to the utmost of my ability." "And please don't be so very, very professional with me."              ( "Then please do not look as if you were so very, very r                  Y  '   much afraid of me," he laughed. "I 'll go over and have a talk with Alfred, and find out explicitly what there is' of it. The Press, here, says there is hardly a doubt of his guilt, but newspapers have been known to make a mistake before now. Let me see: Judge Rivington- that part is probably correct-trial next Thursday. Well, I am all in the dark until I see Alfred. But you must be very tired and worn out with the fatigue and /worry of your tedious journey. Here, Joe, where are / you?" rising and going in search of the missing office-boy. Unnoticed by either Helen or Mr. Churchill, Joe, on the return of his master, had quietly shaken off his som- nolency and slipped from the room through a side-door that opened into a passage-way connecting with the gen- eral landing of the third floor. Asa found him seated on the upper stair, pitching pen- nies with another small office-boy, who properly b4onged to the flight above. He pocketed the pennies, and was all obedi when he saw his master.   "Joe, run around the corner and call a carriage; be lively, and see you don't get asleep on the way." Joe looked hurt at the last insinuation, and, to prove that he was thoroughly awake, went down the stairs three at a time, which nimbleness argued well for the speedy arrival of the carriage. Asa came back to Helen. He would not hear a word of Alfred and his perplexities. "The law affairs I'll attend to, and you are not to let it disturb you," he said, with legal sharpness. "Tell me about the old place. Alia has not neglected to inform me who it is that now occupies Sweethrier Cottage, and the school-mate that paints such beautiful pictures, and the romantic doings of that daring little Hattie and my brave   HELEN ETHNGER. old school-chum, Frank Buel, but not a word of the way- side, and ,the pleasant nooks our feet knew well when we were children. Alma details me all the current gossip, but you, Helen, you only know the dear places that lie nearest my heart." " And better that I should not speak of them, Asa, for they tell us how flitting is our youth." "Perhaps so." He leaned his head on his band, and both were silent. They were passing away from their youth, and their love- dream belonged to it. Happily, Joe reappeared in time to prevent a further depressive allusion to the past, the sententious remark of that active boy recalling them at once to a sense of the present: "It's here, sir," and Joe instantly subsided to his arm- chair and repose. The carriage foreshadowed his being left to his own company again; and he must stay in the office during the absence of his master, and he must not pitch pennies within those dignified walls, though he often murmured "Heads or tails?" in his unquiet dreams. Once more on the sidewalk, Helen felt as if she had entered a new world, andall the anxiety and wretchedness ,of the last few hours been lifted from her shoulders. It was such a luxury to be taken care of, and know she had nothing to fear or-dread. She could be very brave and self-reliant when occasion required it, but she was a little, tender, timid-hearted woman withal; and the strongest of us get tired of being strong, grow weary of our courage, and long to be weak and guided and loved and owned; and' it is pre-eminently a woman's right and province that she should be. She was made to be cherished and pro- tected, and no excess of modern education or abnormal ideas will ever eradicate the truth or alter the fixed and grandly ordained laws of the Almighty. The pernicious   HELEN ETHNGER,.   287   doctrine advanced by a certain class of reformists can only be achieved by introducing upon the earth a new race of women who shall be monsters of imperfection, be- cause created adversely to the divine adaptation of nature, and without the sublime analogy of God. Helen was really glad to lay aside her individuality, and be con- trolled by another, especially when that other was Asa- Churchill, in whom she had every trust and confidence. He saw her comfortably established at the Continental, assured her she should hear good news of Alfred before night, and hastened away to look after the interests of her brother and his client. A servant entered with a tray bearing tea and toast and cold chicken. How thoughtful of Mr. Churchill, and he in such a hurry, too. Put a man in a hotel, and how quick he will manage to command everything; a woman, nothing. She will sit still, and starve or freeze-the most neglected and desolate being in creation. Helen found the tea and toast to agree ad- mirably with her appetite; and when the tray was re- moved, she dropped her weary head to the velvet rest of the sofa and fell asleep.    288      HELEN ETHNGER, I   C:THAPTER  XXVII. OLD SCHOOL-FELLOWS,.        -  keen, comprehensive, sagacious lawyer; and the bee i might never have hummed, and the thistle might never have i bloomed along the old country roadside in the nook his  heart held dear, for all he looked like a man to have had j a romance. But he loved the woman as he had loved the : girl, and he drove down to the city prison thinking more 3 of her than her brother.  "Mr. Ethinger's counsel," he said, to the functionary I at the door.                     I "Yes, sir. Mr. Stratton will show you up."  Churchill was no stranger to the prison officials, and the man very well knew he was addressing one of the best lawyers in Philadelphia; Asa, beingrthe legal adviser of the accused, was, of course, permitted to see him alone; and Alfred was never more astonished in his life than when his old school-mate appeared to him in that capacity. The lawyer, on enter- ing, lodked his young client square in the eye, and then warmly gave him his hand. "Rather close quarters they have you in, old friend. How comes it you are in this fix, after arriving at years of discretion? Miss Ethinger sent .me down to take charge of your case; so speak out, and let me know the facts as they are, and without reserve," he said, pleasantly. Alfred drew himself up, and returned his sharp gaze with atfair of proud questioning there was no mistaking. "Do you believe me guilty, Mr. Churchill?"      ' '           , :   HELEN ETITINGER.         289 "'No, by Jove, Alfred, I do not! I have had some experience, and guilt never keeps a steady eye like yours. Come, shake hands, and let's to business. Tell me every- thing that has occurred since you left home up to this o hour. Somebody is guilty, that is certain; and that some- body knows you, else he could not have forged your name. Give me the narration of events carefully, and I think we shall find the leak, and fasten the crime where it belongs."  Alfi'ed complied, atd minutely related everything that had taken place since he arrived in the city in any way bearing upon the case in point, not forgetting to mention his chance meeting with Mr. Bryant Delano, and that young kentleman's hint relative to perquisites. When he had concluded, Churchill rapidly pencilled Iown several:important names and dates that he feared fight escape his memory, and thgn asked, forcibly, like ohe who knew himself on the right track: '"Where is Mr. Bryant Delano at the present time?" "I do not know. I was never in his company but once. Iised to see him lounging around the bank occasionally, but rarely spoke to him; and how and where healives, I cannot tell.", "Well, sir, Mr. Bryant Delano must be found, for he is the guilty man." "But, Churchill, he is the nephew of my benefactor." "Can't help that: he is a dissolute thief all the same; and if he were the nephew of a king, it would make no difference; although, if Mr. Cassard were at home, I'd willingly give him the chance to hush it up." Alfred shook his head dissentingly. "I would rather suffer imprisonment unjustly, than be the cause of giving Mr. Cassard a life-long shame in his sister's son."  26  HELEN ETHNGERI "Magnanimity is a noble virtue;. but it must not be carried so ,far as to plunge in irretrievable disgrace an honest man's good name; and your father, Alfred, let his faults be few or many, is an honest man." "My father!"Alfred started, and looked at him wist- fully.             '1 "Your father is old and bent and cripple now,-a pitiable wreck of his former self; and were you to see him, gray and feeble and lame, you would not find it difficult to forgive him whatsoever of hardniess your heart may have laid up against him." Alfred winced, and his voice faltered. "I have for- given him long ago; the question is, if he has forgiven me. I long to see Helen, you know her, Asa; she is the dearest sister on ;the face of the earth, of all my sisters the dearest, though Hattie was my favorite when we were little. Helen has been here, so the keeper told me, and would not wake me, for I happened to be asleep; just looked and went away, patient and silent, and that is so like Helen." "Never mind; you will 'soon be out of this, then you may seqaher, and she will tell you that Hattie is married, the old homestead sold -" "The old place gone? not a sheriff's sale?" "Yes; but I have no time for particulars. Helen will explain: only rest assured everything is for the best, and the change in your family affairs is not to be lamented." With that Mr. Churchill was off, and the remainder of the day he consumed in hunting up the boon com- panions of young Delano, and making stringent inquiries as to the suspected forger's whereabouts. No one knew; he had not been seen for some days; his former haunts were visited, but no trace of him was discovered; the bird had flown, and search in Philadelphia was useless.   HELEN ETHNGER.   291   Fortunately, Mr. Cassard returned at this seasonable juncture, and the veryahour of his arrival he was waited upon by Asa Churchill, and the lawyer' soon made him acquainted with the unhappy event that had occurred in his absence. Mr. Cassard listened to the graphic recital, sternly pale and composed, and replied as concisely:. "Mr. Churchill, the news you bring me regarding my nephew, though painful, does not surprise me. I have twice paid the amount of his forged paper, but I will not do it again. No settlement can be effected through me, and I shall speak not one word in his defence. Bryant Delano's propensities for villany are a part of his nature. Let him reap the benefits of his infamous conduct; I'll no longer countenance him or his. unprincipled deeds, and leave him in the hands of the law to be punished as it finds him guilty. Alfred Ethinger, I must in duty defend and aid all in my power, but I cloak rascality no more; deal with Mr. Delano as he merits. I have no wish in the matter." The lawyer took him at his word, and the next hour a brace of keen-eyed detectives were on the track of the fugitive forger. A. few days after, the following article in a New York paper finished the story, and told the sequel of guilt and despair. "Bryant Delano, the Philadelphia forger, committed suicide last night by shooting himself through the heart, while the officers were entering his room to arrest him. His body was taken to the morgue, wherdan inquest was subsequently held, and a verdict rendered in accordance with the above facts. His remains will be sent to Phila- delphia for interment. The unfortunate young man was the nephew of a wealthy and prominent citizen of that city; and his sad end teaches us the sure punishment awaiting crime." d .   HELEN ETH-NGER . That was the end of handsome, genteel, idle Bryant Delano. They buried him decently,--the criminal and self-murderer, and left his double sin to God. Mr. Mellick did live to ask Alfred Ethinger's pardon, and that, too, in the very room where he had charged him with the crime of which he now stood fully exonerated. He did not shrink from an open acknowledgment of his error,either; the same bank officers were present, and he said, frankly: "Gentlemen, I did Mr. Ethinger great in- justice once in your hearing by accusing him of a grave crime of which he was wholly innocent, and I now wish to say that I was entirely wrong, and so far as I can it is my desire to make amends. To convince you of my sin- cerity, I have reinstated him in the highest office of trust in my power to bestow, and hope this explanation will be satisfactory to all concerned." That was the bank president's apology and restitution for his serious mistake, and it was really all he could tdo in recompense 'of putting an innocent man in prison. Mr. Ethinger accepted it, for he could do nothing else, and everybody agreed to forget, or at least never allude to, the unpleasant matter. Of Alfred's meeting' with his sister, it is needless to speak; like all such meetings, it had its tears and smiles, and joy and thankfulness, and many questions and an- swers in rapid succession. Alfred heard all the news from home, and Helen heard all about his struggles and success; and they spent a delightful evening together, conversing of olds times and arranging plans for the future. The ensuing day Alfred escorted his sister to the splendid store of Tinsley, Baxter & Co., promising to call for her in half an hour, when she should have feasted her eyes o'n the exquisite pictures within, and he had trans- acted a little business farther down Chestnut Street.   HELEN ETHNGER.   293   Helen was lost in a wilderness of beautiful paintings, and wondered how her poor efforts ever came to be no- ticed among such a galaxy of art rarities. "I must have been fortunate in my choice of a subject," she thought; "and they were purchased for that, and not as works of art." She stood a long time contemplating the superb color- ing of a Rocky Mountain scene, and the best, perhaps, that Bierstadt ever put upon canvas. She looked up, to discover the brown eyes of a tall, middle-aged gentleman fixed curiously upon her. The look was so intent, and withal so puzzled, that it confused her, and, to avoid it, she abruptly turned away. A clerk passing at that mo- ment, she asked him - more to cover her confusion than any real desire she had to know- if he could tell her who was the purchaser of the painting "Not Happy." The clerk did not know; he would ask Mr. Baxter. Mr. Baxter at that moment came forward, and said Mr. Cassard, a very wealthy gentleman, and a capital art critic, was the present owner; adding, moreoverthat he paid a handsome price for it, and concluded by iqiibit ng if she was interested in it. "No, not particularly," hesitated Helen. "I only asked its fate because- because I painted it." "Indeed!" Mr. Baxter's loquacity became demonstrative, and he cordially offered his hand. "If you are the artist that painted that picture, I am very glad to see you. In conception, it is a gem; and while in our possession, many people came to admire it. Your "Hope," in finish and expression, cannot be sur- passed. Some of our best artists who saw it admitted they could not paint an angel face to equal it. It went 256     294      HELEN ETHNGERo to aim illionnaire on Arch Street, and he calls it the finest seraphic ideal in the city." -Helen gave him her hand, quite unable to check his enthusiastic flow of praise; and at no little loss how to reply. Mr. Baxter saved her the trouble by continuing: "Mr. Armitage, one of the firm, purchased your 'Apple-Blos- soms.' The gentleman standing yonder, near the large painting to the right. Allow me to introduce you. He is forever lauding that charming fancy of yours. What name, please?" "Helen Ethinger." "Ah, yes. Miss Ethinger, this is Mr. Earle Armitage; and since you are the painter, and he the owner, of 'Apple-Blossoms,' I am confident the acquaintance will be mutually pleasing." , And before Helen could object, had she wished to do so, she was acknowledging the courtly bow of the brown-eyed, middle-aged stranger, and privately asking herself what there was about him that attracted her so strangely. Mr. Armitage appeared to be asking himself the same question, until he heard her name mentioned; then his face brightened, and the strange attraction was to him no longer a mystery. Helen, perfectly unaware that she was talking to her mother's old lover, said simply, as she would have spoken -to any other stranger presented to her under like circum- stances: "It is, indeed, a pleasure for me to meet you, Mr. Armitage; and as you, are a member of this firm, the house that has always dealt so liberally with me from the first, and in many respects so greatly beyond my deserts, I owe you my warmest thanks." He looked at the gravely beautiful face, with^ its earnest   HELEN ETHNGER.         295- eyes lifted frankly in sincere friendship and gratitude, and for reply he half musingly uttered her name, as if to make its sound familiar, and seemed to be totally un- mindful of her thanks. "Helen Ethinger." And softly again he repeated it, "Helen Ethinger."  He spoke it tenderly and sadly, for he knew in his heart that this gifted, sweet-voiced girl should have been his daughter. And his spul-child she was, pure and lovely, as ever thought typified nature. The resemblance between the two was so striking that Mr. Baxter noticed it, and was inwardly surprised at the, remarkable likeness. Mr. Armitage had recognized the duplicate of his features the moment his eyes rested on her fair, serene countenance, and it was that which had riveted his gaze. Helen was feeling the situation to be getting awkward, when he bethought himself that she must think him very stupid as well as rude,;and led the conversation back to the picture, without betraying himself. "I have no claim on your gratitude, for I had no voice in the purchase of your early productions; but I should like to know-how you came to hit upon the rare idea so beautifully embodied in your' Apple-Blossoms'?" "Well, to be truthful, Mr. Armitage, I have very little right to claim creative genius in relation to it. I saw my sister and the gentleman who is now her husband standing together under the apple-trees together one moonlight evening ins May, and from that memory I painted the . picture which, I fear, you paid a very extravagant price for, Mr. Armitage --at least three times its actual value." "rNow I  would pay ten times the amount I gave for it; and I would not part with it for a fortune,"' said he, and he said it in such a manner that she could not doubt the seriousness of his assertion.   296      HELEN ETHNGER. "Are you residing in Philadelphia?" he asked, after a queer pause on both sides. "No. I am going home to-morrow. I came a week ago on business to -to see my brother. I live a long way from here, in the country; and I never visited a large city like this before." "Yes, Bergen; I know the place." "You do? why, I did not say I lived there," speaking in undisguised amazement. He bk his lip in vexation at his own inadvertency. "I merely guessed it from the remembrance I have of the apple-trees in that locality. I lived there when I was a boy; but it was many years ago; and I presume the trees I used to know are gone,iand not a root of them even remaining." "Apple-trees are famous for their longevity, and those you used to know may be standing green and flourishing yet. Those I painted were old when, Iwas born, and they still fling abroad their white blossoms in May, and ripen their mellow fruit in September. But there comes my bro- ther; so I will bid you adieu, trusting that I may see you again some day; at least, I shall never forget that we have met." She smiled, bowed to both him and Mr. Baxter in token of farewell, and immediately joined Alfred at the door. Brother and sister disappeared amid the throng, passing without the grand plate-glass windows, and Earle Armitage looked after them with hungry eyes and aching, empty heart. Mr. Baxter was too well-bred to be curious, but he could not forbear saying: "'As beautiful and talented a woman as I ever saw, and so singularly sweet and composed in her manner. A rela- tive of yours, perhaps; Mr. Armitage?" "1 None whatever."        .              y   HELEN ETH NGER.         297 Mr. Armitage left the store and went directly home. He was an artist of world-wide fame, and lived in lonely splendor in a stately mansion, where there was neither wife nor child to endear and sanctify the name of home. He had amassed a large fortune, but he was sadly poor though possessing great wealth; for he had no one that loved him with whom to share it, and his very riches mocked his loveless life. In his library hung the picture that spoke to him so loudly of other days and a lost affection. He stood before it, looking as we do when existence seems wretchedly in- complete and valueless, and bitterly said: ' "It is Emily's daughter, young and beautiful, stand- ing beneath the blossom-burdened branches as twe stood long ago, ah, long weary years ago! It is Emily's sweet, heaven-gifted daughter who painted it; and they ought to have been way children, for their mother loved me; and I--have I not been -true to her memory, and am I not growing  old alone, faithful to my boyhood's hopeless dream?" And of a. high and sacred truth, Earle Armitage, if hands went with hearts, and the marriage vow was not so often a solemn lie, they would have been your chil. dren.   y   *     j 298      HELEN ETHNGER. CHAPTER XXVIII. OVER THE RIVER. EELEN'S return home was signalled by the usual ex- pressions of gladness - mother and sisters uniting in a general rush' to the gate; and they knew by the soft light smiling in her eyes, that she returned happier than she went. It was a long story, and she was obliged to repeat some parts of it again an&-again, so delighted were they with the blissful termination of Alfred's troubles, and the wonders she had seen. But Helen got through with it at last, and when they had all cried, and kissed her, and each had said a score of times that they "knew Alfred could not turn out bad, and it was such a joy unspeakable to be, certain where he was and what he was doing, and they must let Hattie know right away," and a hundred exclamations of the like, she contrived to get a word in on her own account, and inquired after her father. "Oh, he was fast asleep when I peeped in his room, just before you came. He's been cross as two sticks all day, and for mercy sake don't wake him," said Bell, with a littelp shrugging grimace. "If he is asleep, I 'll endeavor not to wake him; but I must take one little look at him, for I have seen and kissed all the rest of you, and I can't leave my father out." She got up, and stole away to where the old man lay gaunt and gray on his bed of suffering and complaint. His crippled and attenuated hands- were loosely folded on the white covering, and they looked very sallow and wrinkled in contrast. Poor helpless hands, they had finished their earthly toil, and -whatsoever they had   HELEN ETHNGERo         299 done of cruelty was forgiven of them now. Helen bent down and kissed them. The old man moved and mut- tered, and frowns of pain and anger seamed yet deeper his wrinkled face. The dim, hollow eyes half opened. "Hattie!" Then they shut again, and he incoherently mumbled the name, and scowled at it in his fitful dreams. Suddenly, he opened his eyes with a wide, startled stare, and gazed around him in vacant consternation. Poor old Luke could not always command his mind, and now it appeared to wander more 'than ordinary. "Helen!" he raised himself to his elbow, his eyes still fixed in their blank stare. "You 've come back, Helen; I thought you had gone with the others, and left us to die alone. And the boy- the villain that has disgraced me,- did you see him?" "Dear father, Alfred is no longer a boy, and he never was a villain. He is a good and useful man, an honor to his manhood and to you. A son you may be justly proud of, and safely trust to never disgrace your name." "You saw him; you spoke with him; he told you of his crime?" Tenderly then she took his lean, crooked hand in hers, so white and gentle and womanly, and for an hour she talked to him of Alfred. How free his life was from crime, although a week ago he was in prison; how fair his prospects now were, and how much he was esteemed by his employer. She concluded by saying: "Alfred bade me tell you that he was sorry for what he did that night, and, if you could, to forgive him, aid try and believe- his heart was not so bad as the one wicked act might cause you to think." The old man turned himself feebly, and a gleam of the old relentless spirit lit up his sunken features. "Forgive him; no, I never will. You did not dare to intimate that I would?"   300,     HELEN ETHNGERo "I intimated nothing more than I thought to be the truth," she said, clear and low, in a particularly earnest voice. The gray brows unbent, the frown melted from his aged face, the pale eyelids settled quietly above the dim old eyes, and Luke fell asleep again, lulled into sounder slumber by the caressing touch of her loving hand and the restful peace of her soothing presence. That evening, while Mrs. Ethinger and her daughters were seated on the porch, enjoying the delicious June moonlight, and the sweet fragrance of the flower-per- fumed air, Helen said in a careless way, as if it were a subject of small importance to her or anybody else: "I had almost forgotten to tell you, that with all the rest of my wonderful adventures in Philadelphia, I was so fortunate as to meet the gentleman who some time ago did me the honor to purchase 'Apple-Blossoms.' Both an honor and a favor: for I wanted the fame, being human -and consequently vain, and I wanted the money, being poor and consequently in need of it. And such a noble- looking man as he is; my heart warmed towards him on the, instant; although, I confess, I did not like his curious manner of regarding me at first. And the oddest'part of it is, he used to live in this neighborhood when a boy, and highly values the picture solely on account of its close re- semblance to the old apple-trees he must have fondly loved in his youth; for he is not young, and I strongly suspect might once have been a hopeful lover keeping tryst under the apple-trees." "And his name, dear; I think you did hot mention the gentleman's name?" said her mother, faintly. "Mr. Armitage,- Mr. Earle Armitage; so Mr. Baxter introduced him to me, and the name lost nothing of its dulcet euphony when uttered by him."  /     tf   HELEN ETHNGER,         301 Emily turned her face away from the moonlight, and stood still and silent in the shade of the honeysuckle. '"Did you ever know him, mamma?" cried Bell, from her perch on the railing of the porch. "Yes; very well, my dear. Mr. Armitage moved West,--I mean the old wagon-maker, his father, shortly after Earle left home: it was long before you were born, and few in the village remember the Armitages now." "Where did they go West?" inquired the persevering Miss Bell. "To Nebraska." "Oh my, that's ever so far off! and did n't my grand- papa Bassford go out West, too?" "Yes; and your Aunt Julia. They all went,-my father, and mother, and sisters, -and made themselves a new home in the western country; and after that all I had left in the world was my children, two of whom I have since lost,-at least they are parted from me; but the three remaining are my comfort still, and they are all in all to my heart." She gathered them in her arms, for by a common im-  I pulse they hovered to her bosom, and the dear young heads pillowed there made her richer far than Earle with all his wealth of fame and gold. "God bless my darlings " she whispered, kissing each in turn.  Then she bade them good-night, and they saw her no more that evening. Alone in her room, Helen's thoughts were a little com- plaining, and they would go rambling off to the distant city, where abided one whom she found it impossible to banish from her mind. "He never once spoke of--of our old friendship. Asa has forgotten it in the hurry and honors of his busy life- forgotten that he ever loved me or ever told me so." 26   8302     HELEN ETHNGER. It was not a pleasant reflection, and she lay down to rest, thankful that this life is not all of the soul's existence. And what of Helen's mother? Emily glided through the room, where her old husband moaned and muttered the night away, and on up to the disused attic at the top of the house. The unclouded moonlight streaming in at the window fell full on the little paper-covered trunk that had once been the object of Aunt Becky's unmitigated scorn. She took a small key from her pocket and reverently unlocked it. All it contained was a few crude drawings, a packet of time- yellowed letters; and a faded ambrotype in a worn, dis- jointed case. But old an'd simple as they were, they were Emily's treasures; and she whispered, holding them ten- derly to the soft light, "Strange that she should have met him so,with that picture a bond of love between them. My Helen, so ike him, with his hair and eyes and noble genius. And he to befond of me yet, when my children are grown up around me, and my hair fast getting gray." The moon went down and left her there in darkness, kneeling above the open tomb of her dead youth, and the hope that died with it. Every passing day brought Luke Ethinger nearer the shores of that silent river whose grim boatman waits invisible for the soul it is to bear across the cold waters of death into the unknown immensity of eternity. Yet Lke refused to see how low the tide of life was ebbing with him, and tenaciously clung to his suffering mortality. He gave no thought about putting his house in order for the long journey whence there is no' returning, and on Helen devolved the hard duty of reminding him of his slow but sure decline. One day he said to her, quite unexpectedly: '             , '^   HELEN ETHNGER.         303 "Have you heard from him - from Alfred- lately?" "Yes; he writes every week." "And you write to him, I suppose?" "Certainly I do; it would be very singular, if I did not."  The old man was quiet several moments. ( You did not ask him to come home?" This gave Helen her opportunity, and she improved it. "No, dear father, I have not, for I thought the time had not yet come." "What do you mean by that?" in a sharply querulous tone. "I mean the time for you to be at peace with all the world, and learn how to forgive, inasmuch as we must all one day implore forgiveness." "What, girl! do you think I am going to die?" he asked, in a husky, affrighted whisper. "Who of us must not die, father?" "Do you think it near, Helen, the - the time you spoke of?"     "Dear father, very near." Her voice, low and solemn and sadder than tears, startled and angered him. "Well, it's no matter; I know you all want to get rid of me." "Hush! refrain from speaking so bitterly, when your words may shortly be to us an inheritance of regret never to be effaced from our thoughts. Leave us gentle words, father, in token of your love, and not judge us altogether heartless." He softened, and made an effort to sit up, that lhe might draw her to him; he fell back unequal to the ex- ertion. K   304      HELEN -ETHNGER. "You are right, Helen, I am failing. See, I am weak as a child, and I'll soon be gone." She slipped her arm under his head and gathered it to her heart, as a fond mother nestles and cheers a sick and weary child. She talked to him long and earnestly of heaven, and the dear compassionate God that pities and loves all mankind. She told him the story of the cross. He listened, the poor old sinful father, strangely pleased, for the story was new to him; and the sufferings of the blessed Redeemer touched a spot in his breast that never before was stirred by a thought so tender and holy. By and by she said, lightly kissing the wish on his furrowed brow:-  "May I come in and pray with you night and morning, father? I always look to God for help and strength in all my sorrows and troubles, and I never sought his help in vain. If you seek him in a sincere and humble spirit, you will find him a true and steadfast friend; and, strong in Gopd's mighty love, death and the grave will have no terrors.", Luke said she might do as she liked. If she wanted to pray with him, he was willihg to listen, and, to gratify her, he would read her little Bible, and see if he could discover the good in it she promised him it contained. This was a great step gained; and thus she led him on day by day away from earth and up to heaven, and the time was now fully come for Luke to be at peace with his exiled children. Helen was almost constantly with her father, and he cor d not bear to have her out of his sight a moment. Every day at his bedside she offered up her simple prayer, and read to him from her little Bible, until he bent his stern pride, bowed his stubborn will, and said, in all meekness:   HELEN ETHNGER.         305 "I feel the end drawing near, and I am ready to go; you may summon them home, Helen, the two I cursed,- the boy for the violence he did me, and the girl for her disobedience. Call them home, for I would like to see them once more." Three days later Alfred and Hattie were travelling homeward in response to Helen's sadly brief telegram; "Come home, father is dying." They arrived a little before sunset, and the afternoon shadows were slanting towards the west, slowly marking the day's decline, when they for the first time entered the vine-covered porch of Sweethrier Cottage. Of the meet- ing that took place there between the mother and her long separated children, the tender, tearful greeting of sisters and brother, and the subdued words of love and welcome, it is unnecessary to speak. They met quietly,- and spoke in low, awe-hushed Whispers, for an old man lay dying in the next room, and they respected the slow approach of death. "Have they come?" asked the sufferer, looking up to Helen with dim, anxious eyes, and the question barely more than the echo of a long, labored breath. "Yes; they are here." A tall young man of two-and-twenty, and a slender, graceful woman, younger still, were in the room, gazing in pale sorrow and remorse at the marcid features and death-wan- brow of their father; but the dying man did not see them. "Helen, my good child," he quavered, in a rambling, disconnected way, his cold fingers clumsily moving over the bed-clothes in a tremble of unconscious unrest. ':My kind, gentle daughter, that I slighted so long, and learned to rightly love so late i When I go up to the Great Judge, he may not be so relentless with me, know- 32 *   306t     HELEN ETHNGER, ing I left an angel on earth in my Helen, who is there tc do the good her father left undone." He moaned, and drew up his limbs in a shivering heap, the shaken mind again wandering away to the past.. "Emily was never Jane to me. Poor Janei she's been dead so- long! No, Emily never filled her place in my heart. Poor Jane; we might have been kinder, Becky, and she might not have died so young." "Alfred and Hattie are here, father. You wanted to see them; They are in the room. Look, do you not see them now?" said Helen, rousing him from his half unin- telligible mutterings of the dead- and the living wife. Luke Ethinger's dull ear caught the sound of his son's name, and he started up,-his eyes wild and glazed, and his breath coming short and quick. "Alfred here? My son, not in prison; not a criminal! Where is he? Let me see him! My son, my son l" "Forgive me, father; I implore your pardon on my knees. Forgive that cruel monster deed of mine!" Alfred knelt sobbing at his father's bedside, and Hattie, too, joined in his pleading cry for pardon. '" also pray at your feet for forgiveness. Dear, dear, father, forgive us. Don't die 3 and leave us unpardoned, to bear forever your curse!" Weeping bitterly, she buried her face in the pillow beside him, and cried as if her heart would break. The burnished gold of her hair falling down on her father's snow-white locks, and lying in satin amber rings on' his wrinikled, ice-cold forehead, made a strange contrast to the cadaverous face, all pallid and clammy beneath- it. The bright, fair beauty of the daughter; the hale, hand- some manhood -of the son; the penitent children; the  emaciated, and once harsh, but now dying old father. Heleni looked -spell-bound at that awfully solemn picture. "' I    HELEN ETHNGER.         307 -looked with her saint-like face, transfigured by the sight that drew her thoughts to heaven, and almost showed her the gate of the celestial land. Luke's eyes grew less staring, the blue-white, crippled hand half lifted and fell back powerless to the covers. "(I did you wrong," he breathed with difficulty. I did you cruel wrong when you were children. I was unjust to you all: it is no wonder you could not love or respect me; and as I treated you ill when little i ou treated me ill when grown tall and strong. I foive you, children, as you have forgiven me, and I die recon- ciled to you one and all. I have been deservedly pun- ished for the shortcomings of my younger years, in the many long months I have lain here, suffering in mind and body, as you little know." Actuated by that mysterious strength that so often comes to the dying, he reached out his arms, drew Hattie to his bosom, and kissed her on lips and brow. It was the first and last kiss Hattie ever remembered receiving from her father. "Alfred." The old man reached his hand beyond her sunny head towards the son he could no longer see- was rever to see again. Alfred raised it to his lips, and the feeble embrace that held Hattie to a rapidly failing heart olded him there also.  "God bless you both; and may He grant that we meet by and by in heaven. Warned by what has been my curse, look to it that you keep in control a hasty and vio- lent temrper." A wail of mortal terror and grief from Hattie brought Helen to the bedside. "Oh, he is dying!" she sobbed. "Helen! Helen  father is dying!"   308      HELEN ETHNGER. t -"Yes, Hattie, dyirlO  she said, drawing her away from the lifeless arm that yet encircled her. Alfred gently laid the hand he held above the stilling heart, his warm tears dropping on its cold whiteness unheeded. Helen lifted higher the poor gray head, that it might lie straight and composed on the pillow. Mrs. Ethinger heard the prolonged and piteous cry -of Hattie, and hur- ried in. May and Bell followed as far as the door; gave on rightened look, and fled terror-stricken from the sig8 of their father's dissolution. The chill lips moved. Emily bent to listen. "Helen, my good child--I'd a love for the boy. ':Emily, Emily,- never the other to me,- are you there, Jane?"Luke Ethinger's soul was over the river. 'The spirit departed with the breath that faintly articulated the name of Jane. He was dead. Silence; a sublime, incomprehensible silence! a peace and majesty of repose unearthly. "Old Luke Ethinger is dead!"  It went from lip to lip among the neighbors, and they came in to look at himwrapped in the grim solemnity of death's fearful guardianship, charitably silent touching his imper- fections, and speakingin subdued accents of his virtues. Once again the grass was disturbed in the vicinity of Jane's sunken grave, #nd beside the bones of his devoted sister, and the wife that might have lived longer if he had loved her better, old Luke was laid to rest. His widow and children returned to the cottage, and left him there to sleep through coming ages. They put away his arm-chair and the cushions and crutches. There was no more need of them, no moan to break the quiet, no hobbling step to call attention. Luke Ethinger was dead and buried. Jane and the babies had got their own again.   HELEN ETHNGER,         309 1 CHAPTER XXIX. THE OLD LOVE ONCE MORE. N a week all the dreriiy funeral hush was over. May resumed her music. dBell's merry laugh sounded joy- ously as before. Alfred had returned to the city, and Hattie had gone back to her home. Mrs. Ethinger -and her three daughters were alone again in the cottage, and the peaceful days drifted on till they ushered in Septem- ber, and began to mark the decadence of another year. It was a lovely afternoon, and Helen extended her walk to the summit of the little hill, where she stopped to rest, and at the same time obtain a glimpse of her old home through the surrounding tree-tops. Strangers lived' there now, but everything about the place looked very natural. Surely Luke Ethinger must be driving along the road on his way to the village. Hark! was not- that the steady, ambling trot of dappled old Folly? No; only Deacon Hopkins and his blind sorrel. Luke was lying over there in the churchyard, and dappled Folly suc- cumbed to old age and the heaves long ago. Buckwheat was growing in the lot where the young corn rustled, and, ripe and brown, it invited the garnering cradle of the harvester. The- fence, where the whippoorwill made his  mournful plaint, still sheltered the nook where the Can- ada thistles flourished, and bees and butterflies, as of yore, were -waltzing over their downy heads., How day after day old things remain! how year after year men pass away, and objects inanimate know no change 1 "Helen   ^ " -"      ^    310  '    HELEN ETHNGER, She turned short about, in great surprise, and confronted the gentleman who thus familiarly spoke her name. "Asa, is it really you, or only a part of my day- dream?" "It is really me," declared Mr. Churchill, possessing himself of her hand. "Are you not glad to see me?" "( Yes, very glad; but I did not think - " "I know you did n't. I came through the fields- cross lots, my old habit; and I came for my answer." "Your answer?" "Aye, my answer; and I am not to be refused this time. I did not speak in Philadelphia, because you were in serious trouble. It was business then, not love; and I would not presume upon it; but now, Helen?"He kissed her hand, and his eyes said the rest. She looked down at her black dress. Her father had been in his grave scarcely three months. Mr. Churchill divined her thoughts., "I do not forget your recent loss, Helen; but that is X something no time can make different. Your father is dead, Alfred on the high road to fortune, and Hattie happily married; and these three positive facts do away with your three most important objections, if I remember aright: and I rather think I do. May and Bell will pro- bably follow the example of their second sister, and marry young, and, until they do, they can live with us. As for your mother, Helen, our home will always be hers, Sohyou see there is no longer any good reason why you should refuse me, and no good reason why I should not press my suit. You must admit that I have disposed of !:them all .in a very wise and comfortable fashion; and now, Helen, have I won you?" '  "I- guess you have," she said, a little archly; " but do not suppose me to be so unjust as to burden you with all   HELEN ETHNGER.         3" my kinsfolks. Alfred insists on taking charge of the family hereafter. He is anxious to have us in Philadel- phia with him, so he can- live at home, and practically assume the dignities of the head of the house." "Just the proper thing for him to do; but we must have Mrs. Ethinger and -the girls with us for a while," replied Asa, delighted at the prospect of having a home of his own with so dear a young wife as Helen to preside over it. She blushed rosily, and he walked home with her, feel- ing as if he were in the'seventh heaven of earthly happi- ness. Mr. Churchill immediately sought Mrs. Ethinger, and quite amazed that mild little woman by saying: "I found Helen by the roadside this afternoon, dear Mrs. Ethinger, just where I left her five years ago, disap- pointed and heart-sick because she said she could not be my wife. She loved mefneaas she loves me now; but she was true to what she knew to be her duty, and for the sake of those so greatly depending upon her, she would not accept the offer of my love and name. Now it is dif- ferent; much of the care is removed from her that then influenced her decision. I have waited patiently: she is willing to reward my constancy. May I have her, Mrs. Ethinger?" -  "Yes, with a mother's love and blessing, I give her to you, Mr. Churchill; but, until this moment, I never dreamed you had her heart. In giving you Helen, I bestow on you the dearest object I have on earth. All my children are dear, but none of them were ever so en- tirely and peculiarly precious as Helen. You have chosen the rarest and best of my jewels; guard it well, and value it as it deserves, Asa, and your life's hippiness is secured." Mrs. Ethinger threw her arms about her daughter, and burst into tears.,   312      HELEN ETHNGERi.  "Oh, Helen, I never thought you had this misery at your heart with all the rest. Yours was truly a great sacrifice. I can understand it, my darling!" "But I had my reward, mother dear, in many ways- in your love, in my father's blessing, in the cheering ap- proval of my conscience." tHelen kissed away her mother's tears; and thus it was that the daughter, who was never to leave her, was be- trothed. The news completely astounded May. To los-e Helen was a grave matter, and she was very serious in conse- quence. Bell was proportionately indignant, and made no secret of saying in Miss Winifred Churchill's hearing that she thought it highly contemptible for a lawyer to come all the way from Philadelphia to marry her sister. Could n't he find girls enough in the city without coming up in the country after their dear Helen? Miss Bell was partly consoled, however, by the promise that -she should go with her, and live in a great city, where she/ could see Alfred every day, and there were miles ofrhouses and no end of people. One clear December morning, in the little parlor at Sweethrier Cottage, Helen and Asa were married. Only a few intimate friends were present; for the year of mourn- ing had not yet expired, and therefore the wedding was quite private. Mrs. Frank Buel was there, also Mr. Frank Buel and Miss Florence Buel, the latter officiating as bridemaid, while Mr. Alfred Ethinger stood up as Mr. Asa Churchill's best man on the occasion. Good old Squire Churchill kissed the bride right heartily, and said he had three daughters now, and hardly knew which of them he lofed the best. The ceremony over, the bride took leave of her warmly congratulating friends, bade adieu to the pretty cottage, and, accompanied by her   HELREIN ETHNIGER.        313 mother, brother, and sisters, Helen and her husband de- parted for their new home in beautiful Philadelphia. A year subsequent to the above eventful period, May Ethinger and Florence Buel were conversing together in the calm retirement of the former's exclusive apartment, where none were received but her very dearest dear friends. The subject under discussion will best explain itself in their own language, and fully define the trying position of each. Florence was two years May's senior, and by right of age she was entitled to precedence in speech and opinion. Both young ladies were to be married in a month, and it may be well supposed that their conversa- tion related almost exclusively to their approaching nup- tials. As will be seen, the two gentlemen the imost in- terested in this grave marital discourse were MiS Stephen Cassard and Mr. Alfred Ethinger. Said Miss Florence, the affianced of the latter-named personage: "May, you will be an old man's darling, as the saying goes. Don't you get a little frightened when you reflect on the great difference there is -between your age arid that of Mr. Cassard, however consoling the trite adage may be?" "Why, he is barely forty; you don't call that old, I hope?" "Yes, I do, when you are only eighteen." "Well, I can't help it, if I am only eighteen," with a deprecating shrug. "I am a gook year and a half older than Hattie was when she was married. I never could bear a young man of Alfred's age; they are so conceited, and think every woman that looks at them to be hope- lessly in love with their dandy charms.", Florence showed a disposition to be resentful, but May was silenc- ing in her argument. 27 ; .    314      HELEN ETRINGER, "Now, Mr. Cassard has got over all that. He don't im- agine every lady he meets frantically envious of his affec- tions. Thank heaven, he has safely lived beyond that ego- tistical era in masculine existence, and the ill fit of a boot or a glove is not sufficient to set him raving. Independent of these weighty advantages, I love him; and if he were a hundred instead of forty, I'd marry him with that surety on my side, otherwise I would n't, if he was worth millions added-to millions,-in short, not if he was worth twice as much money as the tax returns give him credit for having." This smacked of Hattie's mettle, and Florence did not care to oppose it; her forbearance left May a clear field, and she resumed action. "If you like Alfred, why, it is all very well-every- body to their fancy; but you will find out what he is if his neck-ties don't happen to suit, and his shirt-fronts are not done up to perfection,-a wrinkle, a speck, and your happiness for the day is gone. May-be you have n't heard boot-jacks hurled against the wall, as I have, and doors slammed, and chairs knocked around, all of which is in- dicative of manly anger of a sudden and extreme nature. It takes the best-tempered very young man at least fifteen years to rise superior to the harrowing disappointments of his toilet; and I have cause t' be thankful that Mr. Cafssard has already risen above the main source of youth- ful disquietude in his-sex." Florence was aghast, and prudently made no further allusions touching Mr. Cassard's age. The young people absorbed in their own all-important love affairs, little divined that older hearts were in like manner reviving their old affections; but so it was; and May's mother was saying to Mr. Armitage, who was now a frequent guest of the Churchills: ".I never ceased to   HELEN ETHNGER.         31, care for you, Earle, even when it was wrong for me to do so. I was a true and dutiful wife to Luke Ethinger while he lived, but'I never loved him. Helen has been and still is the one perfect joy and blessing of my life,- no: more my daughter than Luke's. I can't forget that, Earle: she gave me the first love of her youth, abjured the dearest hope of her heart for me, and now I give her all there is worth having of my old age."  "And I am to accept this as your final answer, Emily." "Yes,'Earle; I am too old to- think of any other. I have my children, and my dead and my living memories. We shall never be young again."      a "No, but we might be happy;" his face ighte ned of its settled gloom, and he looked really hopeful. "Emily, did you ever tell Helen of our past,-what we were to each other in bygone years?"  "Could I tell her so sad a story, Earle?" "At one time it may have been a sad story, and not for her to know; but now I'll trust my happiness in her hands, and let her just wisdom decide our future. You have always been guided by her judgment in great and small matters; tell her all of our past, and I will abide by her decision." "I will, Earle; she shall have the whole story this very night." Mr. Armitage went away comforted; and   a second after the hall-door closed behind him, Bell burst in ex-  citedly, saying: "Such a  nice old gentleman as Mr. Armitage is, mamma; he just now kissed me in the hall ;and was that quite proper when I am most: fifteen?" Her mother smiled. "Mr. Armitage is a dear friend of mine; don't you like him, Bell?"   316      HELEN ETHNGER. "Oh, yes indeed I do; his eyes are for all the world ex- actly like Helen's; and his voice, too, is low and clear like hers. I could love him, mamma." For that artless assurance, Bell received an extra kiss; and then Mrs. Ethinger left her to seek Helen and con- fide to her the wish of Earle. She found her sitting alone in the dusky fire-light, in that favorite sweet, pensive way of hers that was more nature than habit. "Helen, I have something to say to you." And without circumlocution, or once being interrupted, she recited the sad narration of her disappointed youth. Helen listened, her face unreadable in the uncertain fire- light, and at the end she said: "And to-day, mother, what did Mr. Armitage say to-day, that induced you to relate this long-kept secret to me?" "He asked me to go back over all the years that have intervened since then, and pick up the broken threads of life where they snapped a quarter of a century ago, and, at this late day, be his wife." "And you?" "I refused. Could I do aught else? Then he begged me to confide the poor story to you , and I have done so." "Why to me?" "Because he wanted your opinion. 'Tell her every- thing, and I will abide by Helen's decision,' he said; and I promised to comply with his request. Did I not do right in refusing him?" Helen was exceedingly thoughtful, and slow to reply. Miles away there was a desolate grave in which slept her father. The old arm-chair, the crutches, the cross, gray-headed old man-they all returned and asserted their claim to her filial affection. She lifted her head, and hAr voice was gravely firm:   HELEN ETHNGER.         317 "Mother, you have submitted to me a very strange and solemn question, on which I cannot,- in respect to my father's memory, exprEs an opinion. It is a Subject on which I dare not counsel; let your own heart guide you; only, pray, do not make a single sacrifice for me." The next instant she had left the room; and; there- was nothing for Mrs. Ethinger to do but creep off up-stairs to her own apartment, shut herself in, and cry piteously over the humiliating defeat of Earle's sanguine project. "I'll finish the wretched weakness to-night," she sobbed. "I 'll blot out everything, and there will be an end to my folly." She opened the shabby little paper-covered trunk, took from it the time-yellowed letters, the crude sketches, and faded ambrotype, and huddled them all together into her lap preparatory to committing them to the coal-fire brightly glowing in the grate. She would consign her long-treasured relics to:th flames, and be free of all the past. But it was hard to part with them when they were yet so dear, and had been prized so long; how could she see'them crumble into ashes? She looked stupidly at the fire, and held above it the time-stained packet of letters. The door opened with a noiseless touch, a gentle hand fell lightly on her shoulder. "Dear mother, I knew you were here alone, and sad, and I could not stay away. Forgive me, mother, if I seemed unfeeling; H was only a little surprised."' "Helen, my dear child, I was always weak and foolish; forget what I told you to-night, and don't quite despise your mother." She hastily tried to conceal the letters, and, inpo doing, the ambrotype fell to the floor, entirely parting from its case, and looking a miserable monument of a woman's puerility. 27*    318      HELEN  E THNGEB. Helen picked it up and restored it to her mother's lap, where the sketches still were, half hidden by the poor woman's trembling hands. ?-e "What are these, mother? Surely you are not afraid to tell me now?" "Only a few old keepsakes of mine, dear." "May I look at them?" ' Yes, if you think them worth looking at; though I never accorded any one the privilege before." Helen was silent, gazing at them a long time. "sDon't burn them, mother, for the old love will not perish with them, nor should it. A faithful and pure affection is a -high and ennobling religion, and- Mr. Armitage has been faithful. He can give you a pleasant home with love to outweigh its luxury. I am happy with I my husband. As you foretold, we are all grown up, and one by one we are leaving you; so, mother dear, take the happiness Mr. Armitage offers you ; for I know your heart is wholly his, and be assured not one of us but will love and respect him as friend, counsellor, and father." "Shall I tell him that, Helen?" "Yes, word for word. We have all pretty much changed the name of Ethinger; will you not change it also, mother?" "I 'll think about it, Helen." And Mrs. Ethinger did think about it to the entire satisfaction of Earle Armlitage.  THE END.
