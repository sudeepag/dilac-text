CHAPTER I.
"Coming! Gracious Heavens 1" My-
relda started nervously up.  The letter
in her small hand trembled, and a wild-
rose hue fluttered over her animated face.
Her eyes sparkled-with an excited light.
" He is coming!" Her lips compressed
firmly, -and a half-smile lurked in the
dimpled corners of her dainty mouth.
" He is coming I" It was the third ex-
clamation, and with it a pallor overspread
the speaker's face. The truth of the as-
sertiOn, contained in the\letterher slen-
der fingers grasped, till the red blood
lied from the taper points, seemed then,
to beifully realized. *She stepped quiM-
ly over the soft carpet, and swept aside
the window-drapery, with an impulsive
force that detached a ring from the cor-
nice. She looked up and smiled. The
smile widened, from the parted lips, and
diffused :its sunshine brightness over the
uplifted face, as she contemplated the
result of her .unconscious impetuosity,
till a clear laugh, low but musical, broke
the silence of her little chamber. , The,
heart-gush floated-away---way through
the dusky, lattice, apd died out upon the.
hazy autumn air; and a ;sober, serious'
expression settled down upon the deeply
pensive face. The transitionwas strange-
ly, sudden. The change was like bril'
1iantlau p extinguish deeetually, with-

out a single symptom of previous exis-
tence, by an unexpected waft of night
wind.. The eyes were dark and dreamy,
and no inner -light glimmered up from
the silent cloister of her immateriiheing
She was a "strange creature"--ly-
relda Montford-"past finding out; cold
as an iceberg; capricious, callous, and
coquettish"---so said "the world."
Myrelda smiled at the whisper, and a
spice of scorn was in the transient soul.
gleaming.
"Strange." Myrelda assented tothat;
it Was her ambition to live above the
world :while she lived in it., She was
strangely unlike the common herd;,their
"ways were not her ways, neither were
their thoughts her thoughts." There
was no feeling in common between them,
and the world was incapable of compre-
bending her. The world doffed its beav-
er, deferentially, as she passed, with an
ever-living smile upon her calm face,
and looked after her, as she stepped firm-
ly and proudly onward, with thee cla-
mation: "Lovely and sifted, but hound
up-in a cocoon of selfishness. When will
the nun-spirit burst the crysalis of re-
serve and retiracy, and bask in the sun-
shine of social life."
Myrelda went quietly onward,-repe-
ing softly: " nunuam minas solus, g m
uum .solas."

" Past finding out." She said. "Put
not your trust in princes, nor in the son
of man, in whom there is no help," and,
she only unclosed the door of her confi-
dence and faith to Him who knoweth
the secrets of the heart, and "judges
righteous judgement.',
" Cold as an iceberg." Myrelda look-
ed up at the broad, blue sky, and down
upon the sweet blossoms-the Angels'
alphabet--in the green grass; and off
at the sparkling waters singing a lullaby
at the foot of the hazy hill, and the
rich blood rippled up from a full hidden
fountain, and left a warm painting of
beauty and brightnessupon either cheek.
"Coquettish !" The scorn stood out,
prominently, upon her slightly curled
lip, as she arrived at this point. How
had she incurred this imputation ?  She
had never trifled with the tender sensi-
bilities of a human being ; on the con-
trary, she had nipped, in the bud, every
spontaneous springing of affection, de-
tected in, a heart destined, through her
own incapacity, to reciprocate the feel-
ing, to wither in the wintry winds of
rejection, if expressed. She had never
subjected an admirer to the mortification
of a refusal, if his eyes were loyal to his
judgment; and yet even he-the stern,
the proud, the unseen, daringfriend of
three years' correspondence-had boldly
applied to her this hated termI What
was there, in her seeming or nature, that
snacked of coquetry ? She would be
revengd ! He was coming! Myrel-
da's heart quivered as she thought of
their first-meeting. How would she de-
portierself? Slhem:treybled for her self-
possession in his proud presence, when
the anticipation of his coming, thus un-
nerved her.  &amp;  should not-triumph;
she would be "an iceberg," in truth.
She set her lips firmly together, and look-
ed invi Bible. He was coming, with the
avowed,purpose of "winning her; of sub-

jugating and enslaving her whole soul  -
'She could not help liking him, though
he was neither handsome nor rich. He
loved her, and was determined to win'
Too long, she had lived in "fancy free,"
and tortured the faint hearts of his sex;
he would guarantee to revenge the whole
pusillanimous set, by one fell swoop of
his irresistible power. He would clip
the wings of the coquettish Southern
songster, and imprison her in a matri-
monial cage, to be hung up among the
perfume and roses of his Northern bow
er-sure. He could no longer live with-
out her. She had provoked him into
loving her with a fond intensity that was
wasting him to a shadow. His friends
could hardly recognize him as the ro-
bust, free-and-easy, Herbert Hamilton
of three years agong ! Would she send
him her likeness? He wanted it to
comfort him, in his distress, until he
could make arrangements for emigrat
ing to her vicinity, in order to lay siege
to her cruel heart. He knew the fortress
would fall down, before the first glance
of his adoringgeyes, as effectually as the,
walls of an ancient city at the blast of
the 'Israilites' trumpets; but he .dispair-
ed of subduing her and bringing her to
terms until he attacked her rebel heart
in propria persona. Would she send
him her beautiful semblance ?"
"No, she wouldn't; she was not beauti-
tiful, and must decline having her
homely physiognomy ridiculed by the
deceitful attorney.. She had rno faith in
lawyers-not one whit; wouldn't believe
he loved her until he confirmed the asser-
tion by making his 'quietus with a bare
bodkin,' in order to prove his sincerity."
He fretted and fumed., She was a
cruel, soulless imp, raised on vinegar and
lignun vitae; her acidity had taken all
the edge off his delicious anticipations
of Wearing her sweet shadow upon his
.fond heart, until he could clasp the pre-

cious substance there to relieve its an
ions achings; Would she never be s
rious, and trust him?  He was hone

fiding friend as the needle to the pol
He knew she was beautiful, but th

was that he wanted, and that he was di
termined to win. He had been inform
ed she was " rich, handsome and talent
ed ;" the last he knew, the others h
cared nothing about, only hoped sh
was rich for her own sake, because s
good a girl deserved the choicest bless
ings that heaven could bestow, among
which money had a place. Wealth wa
convenient, doubtless, but then that con
sideratioa wouldn't weigh a feather it
feather. in choosing a partner-not
feather. Similarity of disposition, con
geniality of sentiment, a sameness o
taste, &amp;c., &amp;c., were what he should seek
for; and he should want a woman with
a good share of common sense, of refine-
ment, genuine politeness, generous true
pride, such as a man might justly be
proud of; without vanity,; and above all
loving, constant and lovable. If, with
these, she had money, it would be well;
if not, just as well."
Myrelda leaned her head against the
window-side. The bland breeze blew back
the clustering curls behind her small
ears; and the old soul-full smile leaped
out upon her red lips, as she retrospect-
ed the past.
Three years they had kept up a con-
tinuous fire of repartee, sarcasm and bit-
ter irony. The sharp points of their
" glittering steel" pens had been thrust
into each other's patience and pride, till
endurance leaked out of the wound, and
they mutually quarrelled and quit.

a out the sum on the slate of the past, and

i yrelda was overjoyed at the propo-
zsition ; her pride would not have per-
mitted her to cross the abyss between
them, but she joyfully reached half way
to take the extended hand of the sup-
plicant, and yet she knew herself equal-
ly culpable, and secretly confessed "he
was more righteous than she."
" She had no objection to begin again,

CHAPTER II.
Myrelda drew her rocking chair to
the window, where the soft south breeze
drifted the light drapery on the purple
twilight, and sank down dreamily among
the crimson cushions. Her small head
fell languidly back, and the black lashes
drooped over the dark, clear, and half
smiling eyes. She was delicately love-
ly as she thus reclined ; the round, white
cheeks'looked white and more transpar-
ent still, contrasted with the dark ver-
million background, and the rich clus-
te of golden brown curls, behind her
t little sea-shell like ears, crushed for-
ward by the cushions, formed a glittering
bed of varying hues, for her soft plump
ohin.
A new era seemed about:to dawn up-
on her existence. She held in her heart
a presentiment of some great event, from
which all future events were to be reck-
oned. Myrelda could not have defined
her feelings, had she sat down by her
writing-desk, and essayed to wreathe.
them up in rhyme or plain prose ; they
were vivid, yet intangible--palpable, but
not to be grasped. She looked back
through the dim vista of the past, and
came slowly and retrospectively up the
long aisle of the by-gone, from the hap-
py days of her childhood up to the pre-
sent hour. Her fair face changed its
expression frequently, as she,'turned over
again, with the fingers of memory, the
closed leaves of her departed years; her
life had been strange, and ah ! so sad.
All the sunshine of her days lay behind
her seventeenth year-this side, all was
blackness and sorrow. That golden an-

niversary was a deep gulf opened up in
her heart-history, by loving " not wise-
ly, but too well," over which the pale
lamp of memory was suspended by the
chain of regret, and threw, evermore,
its-feeble rays upon the wreck of her
girlish heart, hopes far down in the dark
abyss. Myrelda shuddered as she look-
ed down the chasm, and repeated aloud:
"The wounded bird, blown o'er the deep,
would sooner quit the shore,
Than I would cross the gulf again
That Time has brought me o'er."
Myrelda Montford was an onlydaugh-
ter-the pet and pride of her parents
and only brother; beautiful in infancy
and childhood, and bewitchingly Iyely
when the bright bud of adolescence ex-
panded into the fresh flower of early
womanhood. Extremely wealthy,,and f
noble lineage, her little barque, freighted
with an immortal 'gem, glided peaceful-
ly, upon the calm waves of affectionate
care, until it stranded in the great ocean
of first love, upon the rock of cupidity.
Her beauty and wealth drew to her feet
suitors by the score, and from that sup-
pliant train she chose the most unwor-
thy.
Lovely herself, she was attracted by a
corresponding exterior, and breathed herl
vow of betrothal to one whose only
charms consisted in a fascinating pw-
sonnel-one wholly destitute of themag-
netism of mind that can, alone, retain
affection.
A sudden revulsion of fortune reduq-
ed her from affluence to comparative
poverty, and the sweet June eves that
should have witnessed her bridal,,shed
its tears of round dew upon her young
head, as she wandered alone and deoe$-

py childhood,Ifors ,last fareweU; and

Fortune.
Long yearbad gone by, since then;
the bitterness of death was past. ;The
vines of fancy and admiration that she,
had "misappreheaided for love-tendrils,.
gradually withered: and died, and. were
biown by'the wild winds of disappoint-,
ment, from the support of her energetic,
adhesiveness; but the memory of that
dread time made her what she seemed-
"cold as an iceberg," as the world whis-
,ered..
Shewas wooed by others-the good
tud'the true-4or she was lovely yet,
despite the black shadows of deep ad-
versity that had clouded her young life,
tobbing her cheek of its olden bloom,
and plunipness, and her eye of its wont-
ed brilliancy and sparkling smiles; but
her heart=remainedefolded in a shroud
of apathy, and impervious to the voice
of love. She looked back at the one
dark spot over which her feet once trod,
and ;shuddered at the 'syren song that
lmedeher on to wo! Through the Worth-
lessness of one, she was led to- distrust
all.
S Years went on; each successive one
more calmly then the last 'to Myrelda.
'Time's soft finger swept gently over her
heart, ad healed theta Brutus-wound
adeobynoe who had solemnly pledged
hunself to her, the poetic eve of their
blissful betrothal, before God and An-
gef, to"be her shield along the journey
of life; the vow was violated, and their
path  through the years' of probation,
were divergnt.  The sorrows of her
4yentmlife flowed omit in song, and many

,ge  i-a itids. The streamlet of:her
soul 'fo*dd on again, in an ideal clime,

and peopled it with fancies and sweet
dreams to revel in. Not for fame did
she kneel beside the fount of Helicon,
and essay to climb the loftly Parnassus.
The flowers of her early hopes lay with-
ered upon the moaning shore of her in-
ner life--she bound them with her own
heart strings, and laved them in the
fountain of her tears; they drank the
briny flood, and ebbed its tide.
How many hearts would tell a cor-
responding tale, should their soul's ar-
cana preface their progeny of the brain.
We pore over their ideal fancies, and
drop a tear, perchance, for the sorrows
of the hapless heroine, nor think that
these dark vicissitudes are but a tran-
script of the heart of their creat6r-that
to quell the surges of memory's sea, they
excavate the isthmus of Thought and
disembogue the swelling waves of F el-
ing into the broad ocean of Ima   a-
tion..
Disappointments developed her no-
bier powers; the slender chords of her
youthful character, strengthened and
perfected by the exercise of long-suffer-
ing, and endurance of life's- most poig-
nant pang, and the pliant-hearted, .im-
pulsive girl, matured into the strong-
souled, self-reliant woman.
A few of her own sex hurled at her
darts of detraction and envy, but they
fell harmless at her feet, and the im-
potent archers foiled in their malicious
design, stooped there, and bore the vile
missiles from the invincible target-the
stone up-hurled for her, came down up-
on'their own heads,,with the crash of
public censure.  Myrelda smiledsand
forgave; they were incapable of affect-
ing her otherwise-than contemptuously
and compassionately. Her life was above
suspicion, and no stain had ever tar-
nished her fair fame.

CHAPTER IV.
yrelda entered "the root, deliber-
ately;- taidly and with the utmost ap-
parent indifference respecting the pres-
deice of the stranger occupant.  Her
dark eyes rested upon the glowing grate
'with a calm, cool and self-possessed
seeming as though that were the most
imiportait object in the small apartment,
She truedd  them  quietly  and half-
dreanily upon the tall majestic form
of her visitor, as he rose with grave
dignity, and advanced slowly towards
her. Her calmness, partially deserted
her as she met the deep, dark and search-
ing eyes of Herbert Hamilton, for the
first time. She was provoked by his
self-possesion and sober air; she had
anticipated a far different 'appearance,
in -her bol.;and daring stranger lover;
she had expected to screen her pertur-
1atioh behind his playful and presump-
whous greeting as he had vowed toi"have
a k's;from herded' lips at first sight;
he mould take her in his arms, and
4ess'-her to- as fond a''heart as ever
throbbed in mortal breast."  An effort
to perform that vow would' have afford-
ed a plausible excuse for her agitation;,
now she had rione. His calmness and
grave deportment, tilted her equanim-
ity,uand a 'deep blush of excitement
inantled her cheeks, as she laid her
hand in"his extended one. An'instant
it  as pressed very tightly within his
'n; the ext, it lay 'carelessly "upon
his soft, warm palm.' He stood silent
andgrave, locking 'don upon her 'rosy
tacse--no word  as 'spoken"as'yet.
Myrelda ttemeptd to'ithdraw '1hr
-hand, but his fingers closed around it

again, and prevented her.  She looked
up into his calm, earnest eyes, and a
second 'blush, twin sister of the first,
rushed 'to her cheeks. Matters were
growing deperate with Myrelda;; the si-
lence was oppressive. Where- was her
boasted heroism, her strong, self-reliant'
soul ? She strove to regain composure
and a half-frown became apparent on
her brow in the effort.
" Be seated, if you please, Mr. Ham-
ilton," she at length said, with a slight-,
ly quivering voice.
He made no movement to accept the
invitation, but releasing her hand, cross-
ed his arms behind him and stood state-
ly and-grim, still bending upon her that
deep indefinable gaze.
"I will sit here no more, Miss Mont-
ford, till I have the assurance that I
am not an unwelcome intruder."
Myrelda's strength had now almost
deserted her, and with its absence a
deathly paleness overspread her face.
"You are not sir," she faltered.
"That will not suffice Miss Montford;
We have been friends three years, and
yet, at my first appearance you offer me
no word of welcome."
I extend it now, Mr. Hamilton; a
friend is ever welcome, and the suppo-
sition that the pleasure of this privi-
lege would be understood, must be -my
apology for not sooner expressing it."
She was trembling, visibly; had she
looked up, the 'sly, exhtilting smile,
lurking in the corners of his large dark
eyes, would speedily have restored her.
self-possession ; it was the strangeness,
the unexpected solemnity and reserve
of the scene that unnerved her.
" During  my epistolary 'acquaint-
ance with you, Miss Montford, I have
found it necessary to require, words po-
sitive, in order to be' convinced of your
sincerity. You appear what you are
not, and are not what you 'are. A

strange phrase, fair lady, and seeming-
ly paradoxical, but one that delineates
yowcharacter." He led her to a seat as
lie spoke, passing his arm around her
slender waist as asupport, as he felt
her slight form quivering beneath the
hand upon her arm, and the same vic-
torious smile shone in his half-veiled eyes.
Myrelda    would have been annoyed
to the life ha she seen that smile; in
all her past history she could not re-
member the time when she had 'been so
provoked with herself. It had been
her best effort since their first acquain-
tance, to equal him in coldness, blunt
ness and sarcasm, and she had always
succeeded till now, when she most de-
sired it. She tried to rally her powers,
and her fast varying countenance be-
trayed her mental excitement.
He sat beside her, and Myrelda felt
his dark eyes rivetted upon her face ;
she fixed her own upon the red grate
with pertinacious silence.
"How very unlike the portrait my
imagination painted of you," he said
provokingly; "I fancied a tall, blue-
eyed, golden-haired woman, with a full
sunny faceand merry laugh everlastingly
ringing from her red mouth; that was
the impression I got from your private
letters-no matter about the effect of
your published articles. I find you wear
two faces, Miss 'Montford; which is the
more truthful, the public or private ?"
" And no matter about the truthful,
Mr. Hamilton; I can compete with you
in that respect, either in public or pri-
vate," she glanced at his face, and look-
ed indignantly sober.
"Because I misled you with refer-
ence to my personal appearance ? Now do
me'the justice to confess I uttered no
untruth, even though' the real differs
from your ideal."
Myrelda was compelled to acknow-'
ledge the fact, but she only did it i en-a
tally.

". But duplicity is falsehood at last,
Mr. Hamilton."
" Only reprehensible according to its
results, Miss Montford, else you were
exceedingly culpable."
" How, sir ?"
" Your present appearance indicates
great gravity of mind, and yet, were
you replying to my letter, in lieu of con-
versing face to face, you would let loose
a battery of levity and bitter iron-y at
my poor head. that would make it illus-
trate the law of gravitation as a neces-
sary consequence."
"Myrelda had recourse to her hand-
kerchief to hide the irrepressible smile
upon her lips. She looked up gravely.
" Circumstances affect our mood, Mr.
Hamilton; if. I did, it would not be
with a view to deceive."
"Do you never attempt to deceive,
fair lady."
Myrelda colored.
" Not from motives that conscience
condemns, sir."
"Precisely, just what I was contend-
ing for; my conscience never chastised
me for misleading you."
"But some consciences are terribly
elastic, Mr. Hamilton, and lengthen to
suit the convenience of the proprietor."
"lMake a self-application of that, if
you please, before handing it oyer for
my appropriation."
Myrelda laughed unavoidably, at the
glance that accompanied these words;
it seemed so like the Herbert Hamilton
of her dreams.
"There ! I knew there was sunshine
in that soul, and I have drawn it out, at
last, Dc you rarely smile, Miss ]Iont-
ford Z"
" When the inducement is sufficient,
sir."
"Then the fact of my presence was
not sufficient cause, when you entered
that door ?"

"Ah !"   Myrelda blushed, beneath
the grave, but intelligent glance he bent

I thought you were regardless of ex-
tetiors,-and that you deemed the soul,

"I do; sir:

Myrelda looked 'indignantly up,nud
turned her ,eyes askance, upon his
physiognomy. -
"iI consider any face. devoid of at-

fluity as the one before me;&amp; and you
were not ignorant of some of my dis,

"I was not convinced of your pre-
judice against the superfluity alluded to.
at apy rate, young lady ; and even had
I been, would you expect .me to sacri-
tie my feelings to humor your whim?"
My relda blushed crimson; the scar-
let blood even tinged her little ears.
She rased her ieady'proudly, and turn.
ed, "er luminous eyes; unflinchingly,
upon his.
"I would not, sir; Iexpect, and ask
no sacrifice on your'part from, any con-'

a reason for my grave reception, and I'
gave it. I always, before, thought that

Tb9 dark eyes riveted upon her face,
were brimful of mirth, but no sound of
risibility escaped him; and Myrelda re-

face :had bent, during the speech, to-
wards the caret. He remained silent
a moment.

" Thank you for the compliment your,
faiey paid ne, Miss Montford, I see,
now, that your sentiments real cor-
respond with my ,own."
He' rose andwalked from her-raised
his hand, and ran his fingers through
the raven rings of hair, above his mas-
sive forehead; when he turned, -the
jetty moustache had disappeared. My-
relda's eyes evinced her astonishment,
and a quick flush of evident pleasure
rippled over her face. He returned
and sat down gravely beside her.
"Do you like me better, now, Miss
Montford ?"
"Yes, sir," she answered frankly and
soberly.
" Convince me of the fact, then."
"How, sir?"
"By throwing off that reserved air,
and giving me one smile-such a smile
as you only, can give.",
Myrelda raised her eyes to his, and a,

" How do I know that you have a

Her eyes fell, beneath the expressive
glance of his. She sat silent and sedate
fearing lest her voice should betray her
mental emotion. An egnbarrassing pause
ensued, her face grew warm from the
stillness.
"And you would not marry a man
who sported such a superfluity ?" he.
asked, softly.
"I could never think him possessed
of a great soul,. Mr. Hamilton; 'and
censequently I could not trust him. It
is, and ever has been one of my deepest
prejudices; the mouth is more indicative
of character than, any other feature,
and when that is disfigured and con-

cealed by such a derogating appendage,
the countenance, in my estimation, wears
a stolid and savage appearance-there
is nothing lovable in it, but everything
repellant."
He smiled.
.." Then you thougltt me very repuj
sive? do you now, Myrelda ?" he utt -
ed her christian name for the first tinie,
with.a softness and tender cadence, that
that unnerved her again, and deepened
the rose on her. cheek. She laughed
lightly, to screen her trepidation, and
rooked coyly up,
"No, sir; Iam not afraid of you, now,i
for .a heathen!  But, pray, why dids
you take the trouble to render yourself
so formidable, since you repudiate the 1
means-?"
"I 'had a motive, Miss Montford."
He had relapsed into his former grave r
and reserved bearing. .V
Myrelda was awed again, and the
radiance faded from her countenance. f
"I desire no' explanation, sir," she
said, proudly.                       v
He sat silent and solemn, regarding
her attentively.,
' If your love is, so easily affected by

secure happiness in that sacred relation y4
-that may be 'beautiful abd true' ~

Myreida was deeply chagrined, and b
embarrassed by his manner and lan-
guage; her pride rose to its full altitude. je
" .You are not justifiable in such an s~
insinuation, sir. You must first prove gl
that my love has been affected by ex- co
ternal appearances. I know that per-
sonal beauty may charm the eye, but it 'as
cannot fix the heart-the soul only, can
inspire love;, I have learned that from  vo
experience, Mr. Hamilton."           W
Experience! how ?" he asked, quick- fla
ly.

"I once fancied I loved, sir, one
whose' mental deficiency too soon con-
vinced me I had constructed my hope
and  happiness castle upon a 'sandy
foundation,' that has taught me to re-
gard the mind as-alone worthy of hom-
age-as the only magnet that can re-
tain esteem and affection."
"Then I have been addressing one
whose heart-garden has been rifled of its
first bloom of girlhood ?"
Myrelda remained-serious and silent.
"'Silence gives consent,' Miss Mont.
ford. And whoever wins that heart
now, must take it second-handed!" he
said, coolly.
"Yes, sir."  She was growing warm
by his seeming hauteur.
"Good Loid !" he ejaculated.
Myrelda kept her eyes fixed 4on the
red coals, but her face grew fearfully
white,
" You never informed me of this be-
ore, Miss Montford !"
She raised her head proudly, with a
ery slight curl of the'lip.
"I d   not consider it obligatory up-

He laid his arm behind her, upon the
ofa.
"True-.-I had no right to demand

infused.
"Do you love him yet, Myrelda ?" he

not permit her to reject him so emphati-
cally.'- his presence had strengthened
the partiality that had gradually deep=
ened through the past three years; like
the maelstrom, he-had drawn her nearer
and nearer, around the circumference of
his influence, until now, she struggled
in the very centre of his magical-power.
She durst not remove from his circling
arm, although die had uttered no word
of love, but, on the   contrary, had
evinced disappointment ather confession.
",B   I am not in the present, what
you deemed me in the past, Mr. Hamil-

quietly, and with modest dignity, with
this delicate apology.

over his. face., 'He drew her back to

himself up, dignifiedly and looked in-
credulous. Myrelda laughed at his af-
fected air.
- "As'far back as my recollection = ex-
tends, Mr. Hamilton, which is some-
where in the vicinity of my third year."
"The deuce ! That .damned rascal,
I mean !"
" Herbert !"' Surprise and indigna-,
tion drew forth this familiar name, in a
tone of -severe reproof. Myrelda forgot
she stood face to face withthe offender,
in lieu of sending a barbed    arrow
through the space of three hundred
miles to chastise him for the vagrant
crime of profanity. Her cheeks exim-
soned and scorched beneath the mirth-
ful expression which came over his fAce
,as she looked up with a half-frown into
ihis beaded eyes.
" There, don't annihilate me with a
a thunderbolt of wrath, Myrelda, as I
am not yet prepared to 'shuffle off this
mortal coil,' of which you are well

aware; aid to conciliate you, I'll take
that back,.if you please, and beg par-
don for paining your little pure Metho-r
diet heart, by such a seeming irrever-
ence. I never swear Miss Montford,
unless, as in the present instance, the
provocation is too great to resist the-
te 'ptation,  If he isn't damned he
ou ht to be, in my opinion; and if his
final Judge has not more mercy than I
wduld show him, or think him entitled
to,; the devil will have a bill of sale for
the miscreant. How old were you when
yoU loved hm, Myrelda ?".
"I was seventeen, sir."
" And how many years have elapsed
since then ?" he asked, bluntly, you see
mi object is a simple ,sum in addition,
in order to satisfy my mind on one point
where your appearance and assertion
conflict."
"Seven, Mr. Hamilton."
" Heavens and earth-.you are not
twenty-four ?-impossible ! Why you
look like a child of fifteen, so frail and
fairy--and your face is as inno----that is
simple as an infant's ! Will you never
grow old Miss Montford ?"
"In heart; no sir, that is a bud of
perennial youth. I have no patienceI
with' people who grow older every year,h
who count the mile posts of every an-
nual revolution, as they roll on in the I
stage coach of progression, over the
highway of Time, towards the station- s
house of Eternity. I don't believe in
the theory, and never intend to practice n
it. A miserable apology for a divine
creion, I call it, who suffers the roll- f
ing years to blow away the freshness and r
verdure, the light and bloom, of theit I
childhood; who marches straight .from n
Arabia Felix to Arabia Petrea, and sits
down ppon the sand of Arabia 'Desert, it
sighing like furnace' for the green things e
of the years they threw away in the m
by-gone. I mean to stand still, like

Joshua's moon, till the battle of life is
ended."
His usually stern lips were slightly
parted, with a soul-full smile, as she
glanced-naively up.
"I believe you! You -have a heart
that will never}count the years, nor feel
the weight of Time. Why I thought
myself at least twenty years your -se-
nior."
"So did I sir, when we first met 't--
she looked archly up-" you appear ten
years younger, now."
"Since I discarded' that superflu-
ity ?  As it is, I am but tenyearsyour
senior."
She colored at his expressive glance.
" Do you like me, Myrelda ?" he ask-
ed, suddenly and bluntly.
Her face sobered in a moment.
" Certainly, Mr. Hamilton !" she re.
plied, indifferently. -
S"That won't do, my lady, say yea
or no, unequivocally,. Are ou satis-
fied with my appearance ? Do -I real-
ize your anticipations, now .9"
"1 Yes sir," she said sententiously.
He stood silent some timed-Myrelda
dared not look up. He extended his
hand as if to say farewell. Bhe gave
him hers, and he retained it.
"You remember the vow in my last
[etter, Myrelda ?"
She drew back .with dignified e
erve.
" I do, sir, and now say I cannot sub.
nit to its fulfilment."
" I have never vowed, without per.
orming, and I will pay this one at the
isk of my life, and your displeasure.
You know it is harmless; if you resist
ne I will leave you now and ferevo."
Myrelda raided her eyes 'to his face ;
t was firm as adamant, and decision and
arnestness were stamped on every linea-
xent.
He toolk her in his arms, and pressed

her slight form softly, very softly, but
closely to his breast. She trembled like
a leaf in a summer wind, and her head
drooped powerless upon his bosom. She
heard, in the deep momentary hush,.the
quicv pulsations of the. manly heart
withintiat bosom. 'He turned her face
gently, and pressed a soft lingering kiss
upon 10r lips.
"Myrelda !" , His voice was low and
half tremulous;
She opened her eyes, and they met
his; they were fall of deep, yet mourn-
ful tenderness; his: face was very pale,
and the firm mouth strangely expres-
sive of mental disquietude and anxiety.
She' essayed to disengage herself from
his embrace, but her feeble strength was
inadequate to the effort-his strong arms
held her softly, but securely, -to, his
bosom.
" Lovely girl, if the strength of this
little form, qivering in my arms, were
equal to:your mental power, the world
would acknowledge armodern Hercules.
Myrelda, do you--" he ceased abrupt-
ly; caught her with a sudden impulse
tightly: to 'his, breast, and. as quickly,
but gently releasing her, turned silent-
ly, .and -left the apartment.
Myrelda sank down, half-fainting, up-
Onthe sofa. % She was bewildered by the
scene that had transpired. She would
have laughed, incredulously, had some
gipsey oracle foretold it a few hours pre-
vious. She became indignant at her
weakness.   He. had triumphed ! Her
small mouth compressed tightly at the
thought. He had performed the vow
that excited her risibility, and defiant
resolve,when her mirthful eyes first read
th bold declaration-performed it with.
out' power 1Qn her part-eto resist him
She was confused and amazed, as she re
trospeeted the past hour. He had ut
tered no word of love, and yet had al
the seeming of a lover ; and had; irre

sistibly, assumedthe privilege of an ac-
cepted suitor. She had never met his
match before; he perplexed hertreason-
ing faculties. One moment he sent to
her cheek the indignant crimson; the
next her heart palpitated wildly beneath
his respectful, admiring eye. He was
bold, yet courteous; arrogant, yet deli-
cate and dignified.'- He could awe her
into silence and diffidence by his grave
and stately bearing, and win a smile at
will ! If that were love, she had never
comprehended its full import and power
till now ; no one had ever .exerted such
magical influence before; and as weeks
went on, and Herbert Hamilton became
a daily visitor at the Vale, Myrelda's
heart was forced to the confession that
he was the arbiter of her earthly happi-
ness or misery.
He presumed no more upon a lover's
privilege, and appeared only in the char.
acter of a friend. He was blunt at
times, but his deportment was unexcep-
tionabie, in gentility and refinement.
He drew her out, without apparent de-
sign, and led her wonderingly and en-
thusiastically over the grand and glowing
area of his. own rich, expansive mind.
The lightness and sarcasm that had,
characterized their epistolary acquain-
tance, was superseded by an earnest,
unaffected tone and manner. Occasion-
ally, flashes of wit and, satire, would
escape her smiling lips, at his expense,
as a refuge for the timid shrinking of
.her sensitive heart, beneath his expres-
sive eye ; but a glance of gentle, though
eloquent reproof, would instantly "ib-
vert her Assumed levity. He could sub-
due her into softness and sedateness,
- without a word !
!    Myrelda half-trembled at the power
she felt he exerted, and strove, assidu-
- ously, to conceal, from him the extent
I of his influence. Her ear had grown
- familiar with his footstep; she learned

to look, and long for his coming; and
her heart-beats became mightily accceler-
ated, at the well-known sound; and
when, after three weeks constant com-
munion, long, anxious days roller lag-
gardly away, and he came not to the
Vale, she experienced a thrill of pain-
ful disappointment, that nqught in her,
past unhappy history had ever equaled.
She knew he was yet in her vicinity
and, his inexplicable desertion rendered
her heart-sick, and world-weary. "He
had ceased to love her-and now that she
bad learned to love him, with an intensity
that was soul-absorbing, he indifferently
withdrew from her society !"
She wished she had never met him.
Literature became distasteful; her pow-
ers of coneentrativeness were dispersed;
her ideas were too dissipated to be pro-
lific of verse, and she wandered through
the autumn-tinted Vale, aimless, and
with but one thought: "he should never
become conscious of his triumph!"
11er eyes flashed, .spiritedly, even
while her cheek paled with anguish-
pride, and love struggled for the ascen-
dency. She could recall nothing, in
the past, that extenuated his conduct.
She had thought he loved her. True, he
had not expressed it in. words, but his
dark, earnest eyes had often been silent
orators of the soul, and more eloquent,
even, than words.
Perhaps he thought her too easily
won ; she might have betrayed her
feelings, despite her efforts to conceal
them from him. Myrelda longed for.
one more meeting, even while she feared
it. Her proud soul yearned for an op-
portunity to retrieve, by apparent apathy
what she deemed she had lost, by in-
advertence, in the' past. He should not
triumph if cool indifference. in seem-
ing, could deprive him of the vic-
tory.

CHAPTER V.
.,Evy skulks behind, to squeeze the gal-bag in the
cup of life."
An elegant mansion on --street,
was brilliantly illuminated, and the hour
for the appearance of the guests had
nearly arrived. Two girls-daughters
of the master of the feast-perfect con-
trasts in person, as well as mind, were
giving the finishing touch to their toilet
before mammoth mirrors, in an upper
chamber.
Rooes of costly pearl-satin, draped
their delicate forns, but the arrange-
ment of the hair, and other little et
ceteras of personal adornment, that be-
tray, indubitably, the arcana of the
soul, differed materially, according to
the antipodal tastes of the individual
two.
Lora's, the eldest, fell in elaborate
and heavy ringlets,.of raven hue, over
a neck and shoulders of surprising nu-
dity, that could not vie-with the lily in
whiteness, at nature's own decree, and
lay in midnight masses, upon cheeks
that were wholly indebted to art, for
there "celestial rosy red;" while a wreath
of artificial flowers encircled her bru-
nette brow.
Mabel's fair tresses were put smoothly
back from a full round forehead, white
and pure as alabaster, and fell in light,
silky, natural curls, behind her delicate
ears, while a single snowy moss rosebud
nestled amid the golden clusters,
Lora's eyes flashed upon you, from
beneath long, jetty' fringes, brilliant and
black as the ringlets around them--Ma-
bel's looked meekly, through the brown
curved lashes, liquid and blue as a cloud-
less June sky.
"tHere ! clasp this bracelet, Bell;

tie performed her part well--you know
the catch is a little impaired."
"Pish !" Lora pursed up her mouth
contemptuously. "Savage, indeed ! you
might bless your stars, Bell, if you were
half as handsome ; temper or no temp-
er !"  She glanced into the mirror, and
smiled complacently.
"I am content, Lora, and not dis-
posed to grumble at nature for with-
holding from me, superior charms."
"You might as well be, since you
don't possessthem! By the way, Bell,
if you'd adorn yourself more, you'd
find it a decided improvement. You
put me out. of patience, with your odd
notions. Those two stingy buds look
rather sneaking, in my opinion. Here
let me twist this wreath around your
head, and give you more of a patrician
air."
"No, thank you; I prefer nature to
art, and besides, I don't wish to rival
you, since you are determined to win,
which-Query :"
"Fudge !" ejaculated Lora, forget-
ting in her petulence, her claim to. ar-
istt racy. "Did you ever know me to
fail?"
"Past success don't guarantee future
triumph."'
"He is only aman, Bell."
"But an extraordinary one, if I am'
any judge of physiognomy, Lora."
"The very reason I intend to tri-
umph !" -
"I doubt it, Lo.; he is not one to
change easily,"
"Change ! you don't suppose her ca-
pable of enslaving him, Mabel Clyde ?"
"I don't suppose anything else on
the subject, sis."
"Fiddle-dc-dee ! I'll bet my head he

Hamilton ! w-h-e-w! I venture to say
he is ignorant of her real position and
circumstances, for it's evident they
make j desperate effort to 'keep up ap-
pearances.' Such a man as Herbert
Hamilton, would never condescend to
wed one situated as Myrelda Mont
ford!''
"It is only such as Mr. Hamilton,
Lora, who think with 'the sweet swan
of Avon,' that 'marriage is a matter of
more worth than to be dealt in by at-
torneyship.' It is only such sordid,
ignoble minds as Fred Gerald, who
make wealth a sine qua non, in their
choice of a conjugal partner."
"I don't want to hear any more of
your nonsense, Mabel Clvde. It is no
indication of a contracted soul. to wed
one in our own sphere of life; and Mr.
Hamilton will never stoop from his dig-
nity and station, to mate with one so
far beneath him, as Myrelda Montford!"
"How ungenerous and unfeeling, to
insinuate thus of one whose social posi-
tion is equal to your own, despite her
reduced circumstances, pecunarily.--
Have you forgotten the divine precept,
Lora; 'do justly, and love mercy ?"
" Then do it yourself, and leave me
to manage my own business, since 'every
tub must stand on its own bottom.'
Mr. Hamilton is deceived; I haven't a
doubt of that-but I'll enlighten him,
and that speedily !"  Her black eyes
fulminated with - ominous significance.
"1Her lackadaisical rhymings   have
touched his fine sensibilities, and he
fancies himself in love, perhaps. He
has too high and proud a soul to wed
one in such ill repute as Myrelda Mont-
ford !"'
"Ill repute ! Lora!  Myrelda's rep-
utation is without stain, as you well
,know !"
"Indeed ?  Hasn't it been whispered
that her terrible temper, and extreme

HERBERT HAMILTON;

His noble mien and calm dignity,,im-
pressed the beholder, at first glance,
with a sense- of his proud ancestry, and
native strength.
His dark eyes glanced rapidly around
the room, and rested with a thoughtful
disappointed look upon the carpet.
Lora exerted all her arts to lure him
to her side, but without success; he sat
calm and grave till the soft notes of
the piano trembled beneath the touch
of Mabel. He rose and moved quiet-
ly towards the instrument, his counte-
nance lighting-up with interest.
Lora soon managed to happen in close
proximity.
.Mabel sang " Twilight Dews," and
his dark eyes rested upon her sweet
face, with a vacant, mournful expres-
siod, as she proceeded. He bowed in
graceful acknowledgement of the pleas-
ure her performance had afforded him,
as she rose from the instrument.
Lora succeeded her, at his polite re-
quest. Her jeweled fingers flashed over
the, ivories, with a rapidity that was in-
tended to startle her hearers into ad-
miration and wonder at her superior
powers of execution.
Mr. Hamilton stood calm and gravel
during the shrieking and groaning of'
the belabored and tortured wires. He
placed before her a simple song, as the,
storm subsided, and her fingers lay pas-
sive upon the echoing keys.
I am glad to find this among your
collection, Miss Clyde, as it is a par-
ticular favorite, and one I have but re-
cently become familiar with- -in fact,
one I have heard but once, and that,
by mere chance. Will you favor me?"
She glanced at the title, and turned
der brilliant eyes upon him, with a
Beaming smile.
Had Mr.Hamilton taken a peep inh
1 her chamber'- an hour previous,
id seen the ill4empered frown upon

her brow, and heard the low vulgarism
which escaped her passionate and scorn-
ful lips, he could scarcely'have identi-
fied her with the now smiling and soft-.
voiced girl.
" I regret that I cannot, Mr. Hamil-
ton, as I practice only difficult operas,
and this is too simple to claim my at-
tention ; but as my sister's preference is
for this style of composition perhaps
she can gratify you."
She turned her eyes again upon the
music-page, and starting, slightly ejacu-
lated.
" Myrelda Montford !---I knew not
that that song was anong my collection,
before !" her lip curled with contempt.
Mr. Hamilton regarded her a mo-
ment, gravely, but piercingly, and turn-'
ed away, with an undefinable expres-
sion- on his firm face; when he returned
he was accompanied by Mabel.
" Your sister has induced me to hope
that you can favor me with this son ,
Miss Mabel " he said, with a -gentle-
ness of tone that made her look up.
" I can, sir, although it was quite new
to me a few hours since ; 'but I admired
it so much that I acquired it rapidly..
There is a touching pathos in the
words, in such perfect harmony with
the air that it impresses me with the
sadness that must have pervaded the
heart of the author, and I sympathize
with her sorrow through the medium of
her song."
Mabel's cheek became suffused with
a soft, delicate tinge, as she looked up
into his dark eyes, riveted so earnestly
upon hers.
" My own sentiments, precisely, Miss
Mabel, I admire it for its pathos and
sweet simplicity. I am no worshipper
of modern compositions (which means,
simply, an apology for everything ex-
cruciating in music,) and believe that in
music, as in poetry, the simpler the.

style the greater the effect; and if yoi
can give it the expression of the author
from whom I first heard it, the effec
will be complete."
Mabel drew her hands quickly from
the key-board, with a naivet of manner
that became her vastly.
"I beg you will exonerate me from
the effort, then, Sir.  I shall surely fail
Mr. Hamilton ! It was from her that I,
too, first heard it, which rendered me
sensible of my incapacity to do it full
justice."
His cheeks flushed fhintly, and he
smiled brightly down on the upturned
face.
"I can trust you, fair lady; one who
possesses a soul as appreciative as yours
cannot fail of effect."
Her modest face bent beneath his
glance, with a rosier hue. She H'esita-
ted a moment, instinctively; then, with
a determined air, her small white hands
swept over the keys. Her lute-like
voice rose soft: and mournful, after a
plaintive prelude, and the words flowed
clear and distinct, above the suppressed
accompaniment. Lora watched the ex-,
pression of his countenance, as he stood
beside Mabel, with folded arms. His
eyes were bent upon the young face,
with a softness and mournful earnest-
ness that suggested the thought: " was
it the songstress, or the author of the
song, that inspired that subdued tender-
ness of seeming,"
She averted her face, to conceal the
irrepressible shade of ill humor upon her
brow, as he led Mabel from the piano,
at the close of the song, without a glance
at her self-sufficient ladyship.
Possessing a spirit of perseverence
worthy of a better causb, she succeeded
in becoming his partner in conversation
during the evening.  He addressed her
with grave and dignified reserve. Not
to be foiled in her mean purpose, she

u gradually led the way to a discussion of
, the merits of the writers of the day, and
t carelessly drawing a neatly-bound vol-
ume from the centre-table, she asked,
indifferently :
r    " In what estimation do you hold this
authoras a poet and novelist, Mr. Ham-
iltoa ?"
He received the volume from her ex-
tended hand, and turned -to the title-
page.
1  "'Myrelda Montford."  I have long
admired her superior powers as a litera-
teur, and thought Milton's innovation
upon Murray's grammar applicable to
her position in literary merit; ' than
whom none higher sat,'" he returned,
calmly.
Lora bit her lip with vexation.
" Miss Montford enjoys an exalted
station among the literati, and is justly
esteemed for her talents, and admired
for her personal beauty, by your sex;
but-" she stopped abruptly, and looked
confused.
"But what ?--if you please. Pray,
proceed. But is avoided by your sex,
I infer from your unfinished phrase."
" I am not authorized to make that
assertion, Sir, as I am not on terms of
intimacy with her, nor associate with
any who. are."
" Are you personally acquainted with
Miss Montford ?" He regarded her
steadily, with an immovable counte-
nance.
"In childhood we were school-mates,
but have had no intercourse for years.
I meet her occasionally, in public, and
truly pity her unfortunate fate; but it
is not considered advisable to continue the
acquaintance, under the circumstances.
She lives very retired, I am informed,
and hasacquiredgreater celebrity abroad
than at home. I really admire her writ-
ings, and often feel a desire to renew
our former friendship; but we frequent-

wealth and station. The veriest rascal
may screen' himself behind a golden
post, and escape a richly-merited halt-

would be a noble-act of moral heroism
to extend to her tie support of your
favor and influence, in order to effect
her rescue from the shade of appro-]
brium into which she has fallen."
"No one, Mr. Hamilton, is beyond
the reach of stigma, in any position, if
they voluntarily lay themselves liable
to incur it.'"'
46Very true-your prudence is com-
mendable. Is she, then, so reduced,
in the estimation of society, as to ren-
der such scrupulous care to avoid per-
sonal contact, absolutely necessary ?"
Lora sighed very softly.

has been made the subject of discussion
since it has led me, insensibly, into the
error of seeming disparaging insinua-
tions. I frankly confess I have spoken
inadvertently, and imprudently, and
beg you will consider what has been
said, an involuntary repetition of mere
rumor."
"Pray, do me the favor to state upon
what rumor bases its deteriorating

"Upon the fact of her lover's deser.
tion, whom you may see yonder; and

who denies the imputation of change
bleness, occasioned by her reverse
fortune, as some have been charitable
enough to affirm, in her defence, and
to his detriment.''.
Mr. Hamilton turned his large, deep
eyes, upon the tall and strikingly hand-
some individual designated, and a fierce
light gleamed from their midnight
depths. Lora's jealousy subverted. hr

tion of infinite scorn upon his com-

"She has one of the sweetest and,

will coefess at first sight."  Lora
affected ignorance of their personal ac-
quaiitance, from motives politic. "But

bit her lip, with seeming vexation.

It was not without design that he
entered on this discussion; but at the

was puzzled for a conclusion.

It was a dreamy-Indian summer day.
Myrelda sat under the old willow, by
the spring, looking off at the dark river
waters rolling silently onward to the
great ocean reservoir. Her small hand
held a pencil upon an open page, but'
few  characters were traced upon the
shiny sheet.   She looked down and
rested her pale, forehead upon ,the ta-

sat long and motionless,,
"I cannot,-thought is vagrant,"-
she rose slowly and sadly from the wil-
low-roots as she uttered this self-ad-
dress, laid the sheet in her portfolio and
turned towards the cottage.
Aunt Linder, the cook, met her in
the garden walk, she looked up under
her cap border end eyed her earnestly.
"ILor bless yer heart, honey, you

Myrelda smiled with affected cheer-
fulness, at the affectionate old creature's
solicitude.
" I am well, aunty, only a little tired;
I am going right out now and obey in-
structions."
" She can't fool me, po thing !"-
muttered the old woman, as she looked
anxiously after the tripping form of
her young mistress. "It's dat Ham-

He stood, in stately dignity regarding
her attentively, with a strange compres-
ion of the stern lips, around which
glimered the faintest ghost of a smile.
She turned quickly to conceal the
treacherous blood that came rushing up
beneath his glance, as Doctor, and Mrs.
Gerald entered, followed closely by Mr.
Berrien, whose presence was not prompt-
ed by a desire to patronize the proprie-
tor, of the -establishment, but merely to
become anobserver of two within, whose.
entree he had witnessed from a distant
station
Myrelda's ear soon apprizedher by
whom she wps surrounded. Mar. Ham-
ilton'svoice, in evident reply to' some
request attracted her.
" ertaihiy, Sir, if it is desirable, and
will bean accommodation, I will un-
hesitatingly accept the invitation."
Mr. Berrien responded in a loud and
joulrari tone .-turning to the group.
' aow all men by these presents,

ci'tin, in the city of Arlingford, have

lington at tie time appointed, has and

does consent to become his substitute on
that occasion-Amen !"
A merry laugh from all parties fol-
lowed the finale. Myrelda, from child-
hood, had loved and esteemed the warm,
generous, and noble-hearted speaker.
She would have accosted him sooner,
but from an aversion to meeting others
around her, and affected ignorance of
his presence. She now turned impul-
sively at his humorous, announcement,
and -met his smiling eye fixed intently
upon her. In a tone of pleasantry char-
acteristic of the man, he approached and
addressed her:
"My dear young lady, it has been
most truthfully asserted that 'where
there 's a will there 's a way.' Now, I

method I'll venture the assertion you
would have been deaf, blind and dumb,

obedient was concerned."
Myrelda took her cue from the ex-
pression of his countenance.
" No one can long remain uncon-
scious of Mr. Berrien's presence whose
auricles are not impervious to the 'voice
of seven thunders'"-her face was scru-
pulously sober.
Mr. Berrien's eyes- twinkled with
amusement at her affected air and cool
satire. He turned to Mr. Hamilton,
whose face betrayed an effort to sup-
press his humorous emotions.
" Just hear that !..--I never touch

ear her, with the hope of"gathering
somewhat from their conversation, as
a cue to further proceedings. Hamil-
ton's last words startled him, and un-
consciously he turned his eyes upon
her calm face to observe the effect of
his declaration, and quailed before her
full, unflinching glance; but remem-
bering that the eyes of her lover were
uponhim, with all a villian's forethought
and' impudence, he rallied instantly,
touched his hat.with mock deference,
and' bestowed upon her a would-be sig-
nificant smile.
Myreldd comprehended the miscre-
ants motive, and with an immovable
countenance, looked him firmly in the
face-without deigning to return his sa-
lute, with a slight tincture of scorn
upon her red lips that deepened as she
gazed, and a brilliant flash of the eye
that rendered her glorious in her indig
nation.
Gerald's courage was fast oozing away
before her proud eye, and to avoid 'a

second wincing, he turned    carelessly.
and sauntered towards his occupied wife
and the watchful but apparently indif-
ferent Lora.
Myrelda glanced instinctively at Ham-
ilton; his face was rigid and white as
marble, and the dark- eyes hidden be-
neath the downcast lids. An icy cold-
ness ran through her veins, and irre-
pressible tears sprang to her eyes, as
she met Mr. Berrien's kindly' glance.
She turned to the counter to complete
her purchases, then went quietly from
the bazaar Mr. Hamilton was occur
pied in examining some article exhibit-
ed by Lora, for his admiration and in-
spection.

exit of Myrelda and glanced triumph-
antly at Mabel. w)1ose mild blue orbs
reproved her artfulness in detaining
Hamilton.-- Mr. Hamilton saw both the
smile and the glance, though seemingly
absorbed in contemplating the bauble
presented for his inspection. He re-
turned it with a few appropriate words,
touched his hat politely, turned and
left the establishment with an air and
quickness of step that left no doubt of
his design. Mabel smiled now, and
Lora'bit her lip with ill-concealed vex-
ation.  Dr. Gerald grew    pale  with
jealous excitement, and sauntered care-,

sensation to her heart. Her face flush-

Though greatly indebted to Mr. Ber-
rien's influence for the auspicious com-
mencement of his professional career in
Arlingford, yet Herbert Hamilton's own
metal ability and oratorical powers, as
displayed on political occasions, during
the Presidential campaign of 184-, in
the city of A., won him the client whose
intricate affairs subjected him to nights
of watchfulness and toil. Mr. Edwards,

and privately declared, "Hamilton could
reason black into white, and give to a
thunder-cloud the tints of the rainbow,
as well as the next man."
He obtained an introduction, through
Hr. Berrien, and learning Hamilton's
intention to establish himself- in town
for a time, placed in -his hands papers
pertaining to a contested estate, thatre-
quired days of incessant labor and legal
cunning to comprehend. Hamilton's
reputation hung upon this, his frst case,
in a strange land, and with character.
istic energy, and indefatigable zeal, he
labored to acquit himself ,honorably.
But despite his strong will, his thoughts
would wander from the soiled pages be-
fore him to the quiet Vale. "Where
was Myrelda ? Did she watch and wait
for his coming, and grow sad at his de-
lay ?" He smiled at the thought of test-
ing her feelings by his absence, and
learning the extent of his influence by
her appearance at their next meeting;
yet at the close of that interview Ham-
ilton was no wiser, though a little more
sanguine of the success of his sheeme,
than before.

It was the eve previous to that which

Vale, towards the city garden, gorgeous
with the brilliant tints of a glorious
Autumn in the sunny South.
Myrelda's cheeks were'flushed to a
charming hue, by the surreptitious
glances she detected, ever and anon,
from  Hamilton's admiring and half-
smiling eyes, directed towardsher.
A motley group surrounded a pump,
directly in their route, among which
Myrelda distinguished one denomiinMtd

wayg a joud word and hearty laugh for

work aseasy as though he held a deed
in trust for every inch of ground in
this old terrestrial ball that 'hangs upon
nothing,' and every individual denizen
that crept upon it, was his tenant.
joe was the butt of the whole town,
but so good-natured that he never re-
sented an imposition, save by appointed
remark that sepithe crowd in a roar, and
restored universal. harmony. He was a
privileged personage, and went "scot

or what was equivalent, "wormed" suf-
ficient out of the captain or conductor
to pay his fare. He never had a physi-
cal ailment, or met with an accident,-
but he;went straight-wayto the apothe-
cary with the story of his suffering,
designated:such drugs as the physician
hod prescribed, but "s'posed he'd have
to endure it, 'cause he hadn't got any
money to buy 'em '? Joe got the drugs
"without money, and without price."
Joe'smission,ion the present occasion
was toetrry a bucket of water from the
pump to his mother, and:he waited pa-
tietly, for access to the pump-handle,
to do his errand.
4 frolicsome youth in the group, fully
ripe for fun, at the 'fool's' expense, sud-
deslygrabbed Joe's hat and tossed it
upon the wet soil, at the same time
making tracks from his vicinity.

"That shows yer brains, and yer
bringin' up !" shouted Joe, as he care.
fully picked up his well-worn chapeau,
and eyed it narrowly, to inform himself
of the injury it had sustained from such
ungentlemanly treatment.
His eye fell upon Myrelda, and her
gallant, as he brought the insulted hat
with a nervous jerk, upon his tangled
tow-head. Now Joe was aiwardent admi-
rer of the fair girl, and prided himself
upon doing her the favorknasked,of fur-
nishing a glass fronf the nearest habi-
tation and presenting her a cool, spark-
ling draught of Adam's ale, from the
far-famed pump, whenever they chanced
to meet there, during her evening walks
which was not unfrequent, receiving
in return for his gallantry, a copper
coin, which was quite as large, in Joe's
big blue eyes, as a Spanish dollar in a
miser's.,
Joe clenched his hand indignantly,-
as he observed Hamilton, and -felt a
twinge of the green-eyed monster tug-
ging at a string in his mental machin-
ery.
" Dad drap 'im!"'he growled, "I

with Joe darted for the nearest domi-
cil and had a brimming glass in readi-
ness for Myrelda, when they came up.
Mr. Hamilton essayed to take it from
him, and present it to his companion,
but Joe draw back with an air of offen-
ded dignity that slushed half the con-
tents from the glass and rendered it
necessary to refill.
Myrelda glanced significantly at Ham-
ilton, and received it at Joe's hand,
with a smile and 'thank you,'. that
stretched Joe's mouth from.ear to ear,

-mediate declaration of the love she
fancied'shi b heldin those dark,-smil-
ing eyes;' she was disappointed and
chilled by his manner.
The city clock told the hour oftwelve
before lanilton left the - Vale; and
yet no'word of affection had passed his
lips, and Myreldai was no nearer the
secret of his design than when they
first .met. . Weeks rolled away, and
matters had not ",pproximated a crisis,
Hamilton had trhianphod in the suit in-
stituted by Mr. Edwards, and all ton-
gues "rang the changes" upon his name
as a lawyer of unsurpassed legal ,bili-
ty and ,superior- eloquence.
Ambitious others, who had marri-
ageable daughters, gave entertainments
fbr his benefit; he was courted and
iateedrei to a degree that would haVe
inflated an ordinary man with self-bon-
eit, to an explosive point. But Her-
bert Hamilton received the adulation
offered him  with a cool dignity and
grave polithss that gave rise to fre-
1equit speculationsupon the nature of
his mental cbnforimation. He was the
cotistaritattendant 'of Myrelda, when-
ever she appeared innpublic; and a cer-
*aih "old maid" oracle of the town, had
even positively specified the day of their
nuaptiels, to the inconceivable chagrin
of man   a fair aspirant for his favor,
--among which host Lora Clyde stood
pre-eminent---and the unparalleled ex-
citement of Dr. Gerald.
Gerald paced this oike with the hv-
rieaded monster-of 1EVENR Eguard-
ingl the door of the 'jfernal regions"
of hia inner nature. ;His handsome
face was livid with- passion, and the
fge qyes so soft, liquid, and "beauti-
fqlly blue" in smiles, sapped fierce fire
leneeh the black arching brows.
Â«,' ;do it l'{lhe mnttered between,
! d h ed teh~-"he shall not tri-
p wh ie dhis .'ad has nerve to pull

a trigger or handle a sword ! He is too
proud to decline and be branded a cow-
ard. There is no alternative but death
for ohe or both! I'll do it, by-   !"
He dreg his chair to the glowing
grate, and sat down to perfect his plans.
Myrelda was the only woman that
Gerald ever really loved, and the possi-
bility of seeing her the wife of another
maddened him. He now realized what
must have been her anguish at behold-
ing him united to a rival; for Gerald
had never doubted her love-it was im-
possible from the very nature of sur-
rounding circumstances.
He had "married for money,"' a pee-
vish, consumptive looking girl, who, he
fancied, and fondly' hoped, would not
long be a barrier to the realization of
his dreams of yet wedding Myrelda;
but who, contrary to his expectations,
had lived on and on, the pest of his
life, with her captious and jealous na-
ture, until Gerald; had he possessed
tire nerve, would have dragged her cup
in desperation, and thus rid himself of
the incubus.
-He was a dastardly villian, who would
have perpetrated any deed of darkness
but for. the dread of detection. He
was absolutely vain and unprincipled
enough to believe he could so affect the
mind of Myrelda, by an eclairissement
respecting the events and motives of the
past, as to win her forgiveness and be
reinstated upon the throne o.f her heart !
He would not have hesitated to lay his
fortune at her feet, and take her to his
arms penniless now ; but Gerald was
too indolent, and had too little self-reli-
ance to, wed her, a poor man, and be-,
thrown upon his own resources for fu-
ture independence, He had reflected
on her character to subserve a dupli-
cate purpose, but he reconciled it with
an elastic conscience, by promising to
make ample reparation for the wrong,

after the removal of the one obstacle t
his happiness, whose sudden demis
coupled with subsequent transaction
might subject hinm to 'suspicion, a
perhaps provoke a post-mortem invest
nation. Mrs. Gerald was indebted fo
her daily powers of respiration to th
villhins pusillanimity next to the grea
Arbiter of human destiny.
But noi, Gerald was growing reek
less and doubly desperate. In spite o
his unceasing efforts to poison his min(
by innuendoes. Hamilton persisted it
his attentions to Myrelda, resisting th
manifest desires of others equally gift
ed in personal attractions, and far su
perior in pecuniary circumstances, t(
capture him; and would complete th
drama by uniting her to himself, by an
indisoluble bond.
. Gerald resolved, in his own mind
that that compact should never be seal
ed, while he lived to witness it! Had
he possessed the power of ubiquity, he
would have frowned less fiercely, and
planned less deadly, in the solitude of
his vindictive and invidious soul, but
laughed with fiendish exhultation to be-
hold the gulf that had opened up with-
out his agency, between the two he so
yearned to divide forever !

It was a keen, frosty night in De-
cember, unusually cold for so southern
a latitude. Hamilton, as was his wont,
lad passed' the evening at the Vale.
His pannerwas so softened, and insinu-
ating, that Myrelda had confidently ex-
pected, with a palpitating heart, a crisis
before his departure, and was painfully
disappointed when he rose to retire,
without meeting her anticipations

r    Myreldia observed it, though so trans-

t a snowflake upon the warm bed of her
heart, where such rosy nymphs of love
and hope had so recently nestled. She
f half shrank from the hand extended

e sion hitherto unknown in the presence
of Herbert Hamilton.   She tried to

e to her lips; but it was not a heart-sinile,
Hamilton saw that. -He Fel her hand

fie bowed with stately dignity, and
left her with  firm resolute step. My-
relda heard the door close behind him.
She went deliberately anid caluy and
turned the bolt, and 'returned as col-
lectcdly. She remenbered sitting'dowd
upon a low ottoman, and leaning hei-n
head against the 'sfa-cashions with"
strange sensation'of fullness in the re-
aion of the brain, but nothing more.
When she awoke to coimousness, an
icy coldness pervaded her slender fame.
The lights burned grim  and ghostly,
but the fire had gone out in the grate,
She consulted her watch-it was past
3 o'clock  Harnilton had left .her at
eleven.
She turned off the gas'and ascended
to her chamber. The night-taper threwv
its sickly rays over the apartmetit as
she entered. 'She took her little bile

True to her promise, Aunt Lind
had watched Hamilton "like a chick'
eyein' salt," and no change of Myre
da's countenance had escaped her vig
lant eye; but for sometime past he
anxiety had been relieved by the smoot
aspect of circumstances.  Now   sh
glowed with indignation, as the poo
girl entered the breakfast-room, after
night of such mental conflict. It tol
unmistakably, upon her pale face, an
in her languid eyes ; though she mad
indisposition an apology for her appear
ance. Aunt Linder was not to be mis
led as easily as Myrelda's aged and in
valid father.
" Consarn 'im !" mumbled the ol
woman over her morning's avocations
" I knowed it! I seed it all in 'ih

She gave orders to Rose, and wateo

care to answer it in person. She con-'
strained Myrelda to take an anodyne,
and she was slumbering from the effects
when -Hamilton approached the cottage
and rang for admission. It was much
earlier than his usual hour for visiting
at the Vale.

d the old woman, with instructions to

awaking, and left the cottage slowly,
- and with a dejected air.
-   "I wonders w'at 'e rit on dis thing,"
soliloquised the old woman, as she turn.

She threw it in the stove, without
a single twinge of conscience !
The ignorant old creature thought
she was doing her darling young mis-
tress a service!
At the usual hour, Hamilton again
appeared, and was met by the watchful
old woman.
" How is your mistress now, mother?"
he asked, smilingly.
"Better, Sir, but she don' want to see

"What ?" he turned upon her with
a glance so fierce, that aunt Linder
quailed.
"She don' want ter see cump'ny, Sir."
"You gave her my card ?"
"In course, Sir.

He sprang downthe steps, and strode
away at a rate that betokened a mind
ill at ease.

said the old negress, as she-looked after,
him. "I never seen sich a look as dat
'fore! iHe turned white as a sheet, too!
an' die morning' 'e cullerd like fire;
Good nuff fur 'im-let 'im fret I He

The day waned slowly and wearily to
Myrelda. In spite of herself she had
hoped and listened for his . coming.
Surely he could not leave her thus.,
His sound .judgment, upon reflection,
must commend her. She could not be-
lieve 'him  unworthy; she reproached
herself for the spirit she had manifested
the evening previous. Had she been
more gentle, they might have parted in
amity. Herbert Hamilton rose up be-
fore ,her in the fullest proportions of
manly excellence; he stood a perfect
embodiment of nobility  and  virtue;
love veiled all his imperfections, and
even his inconsistencies dwindled into
mole-hills that her injustice had magni-
fied into mountains.
But the red sun went down behind-
the purple pile in the west, and day af-
ter day rolled leadenly away, and yet he
came not. Her physical frame declined
through'sympathy with the mind, and
disease locked up with the key of de-
lirium the store-house of the sufferer's
mind.
CHAPTER XIII.
Regardless of wringing and breaking a heart
Aireadyto sorrow resigned.-CowPER-.
Myrelda slowly convalesced and went
very pale, but apparently cheerful about
her daily duties. She had ceased to
lok for Hamilton'svisits' and his name
never passed her: lips, save to her- in-,
firm father's inquiry concerning his ab-
sece. She simply replied that their

intercourse wasended; and Col. Mont-
ford imagining that Hamilton had shared
the fate of her former lovers, made no
further allusions to him. He was well
satisfied with her rejection of his suit,
as he fancied, - Myrelda was theidol of
his heart, and the only remaining tie
that bound him to earth; for Charles,
bis noble, high-souled boy -of six-and-
twenty summers, he had long mourne4
as dead. Twelve months had gone by,
and brought no tidings of the wander-
er; but Myrelda, whose organ of Hope was
more fully developed, had not so soon
despaired. She endeavered to induce
her aged parent to indulge brighter
anticipations respecting the disclosures
of the future.
Three weeks had passed, and still she
had not seen Hamilton; and Myrelda
sat dreaming of all the by-gone con-
nected with him, when a timid tap at
the sitting-room door aroused her. A
little, pale beggar boy entered at her
bidding, large tears standing in his meek
blue eyes, as he lifted them mournfully-
to hers. Myrelda drew the little fel-
low close upro the 'grate, and warmed
his tiny bare feet, that were red and
pinched with cold. He was no stranger
to the charitable girl, and had come on
an errand that wrung his-childish heart
to perform. His mother was dying, and
desired to see her benefactress before
her weary heart was still forever. .,
Myrelda hastily donned her mantle
and furs, and obeyed the sad summons.
was the first time since her rupture
with Hamilton, that - she had left the
cottage, and her heart gave an acceler-
ated throb, as she thought of the possi-
bility of meeting him. But Hamilton.
was invisible; and she reached  the
widow's poor dwelling without receiv-
'ing an -electric, shock from those search-
ing black eyes.
'-Mrs.:Fairfield's desire was to commit

I . .,-

OR, TR E B3A8 BLTU.

to Myrelda's benevolent care, her little
orphan child, when she was no longer
permitted to care for him. She had
wedded in opposition to her stern father's
imperative command, who had obstin-
ately persisted in refusing to pardon the
filial disobedience, but who would, she
cherished the hope, receive his little
grand-son, when the grave had softened
the sin of his mother. She humbly,
besought Myrelda's -intercession in be-
half of the helpless one. Her' father
was an aristocratic citizen 'of Raleigh,
North Carolina, and she implored her
influence, through the medium of an epis-
tolary communication.
Myrelda relieved the poor woman's
solicitude, by promising to exert her-
self, to the utmost in the boy's behalf,
and give him- a home at the Vale, until
the relenting father should claim his
little grand-child.
A step arrested her attention; she
turned and met the smiling blue eyes of
Dr. Gerald ! She bowed haughtily, to
to his graceful salutation.
"I was not aware that Dr. Gerald
was your physician," she said, turning
to the widow with flashing eyes.'
'Neither is he, Miss Montford ; Dr.
Merton is the-'good Samaritan' of the
poor.                          -
-Myrelda cast upon him a glance of
ineflable'scorn,and repeating her promise
to 'the suffering woman, she turned
proudly, and left his presence.
This was what Gerald expected and
desired. He had seen her pass with
the poor boy, and divined her destina-
tion. Half an hour subsequent, he ob-
served' Hamilton tending in the same
direction,  A  swift thought flashed
through the miscreant's mind.   He
would try one experiment before resort-
ing to lead or steel.- He went hastily
through a parallel street, and watched
for Hamilton's approach, and perceiving

48

him in the distance, he calculated with
all a villain's accuracy; and when My-
relda left the humble abode she observed
Hamilton directly opposite.
The uniiexpected apparition unstrung
every nerve in her system, and,,to add to
her confusion, Dr. Gerald n -w issued
from the same dwelling, and went rap-
idly in an opposite direction !
Myrelda's bloo4seemed to freeze in
her veins, as she saw the deep eye of
him, whose esteem was dearer to her
than life itself, turned sternly towards
her. What thoughts might arise from
such a coincidence ?. She was in a state
of utter despondency when she entered
her chamber, and threw herself, in wild
abandonment, upon the bed.
She could not comprehend how Ger-
ald had planned so perfectly, yet she
could not attribute it all to chance.
She saw his object was to render her
despicable in the estimation of Hamil-
ton, and he had, in all probability, suc-
ceeded., They were sundered now, and
no explanation could be given him, even
if an explanation would prove satisfac-
tory - under such suspicious circum-
stances. Perhaps Hamilton's incom-
prehensible conduct was wholly attri-
butable to Gerald's machinations; and
now the'incident was well calculated to
become "confirmation strong" of any
deteriorating whispers that had reached
the ear of even the most generous and
lenient.
Myrelda quivered convulsively through
her entire frame, and to compose her
nerves and forget her misery, she eager-
ly swallowed down a copious soporific,
and was under its lethean influence,
when Herbert Hamilton, for the third
time since the eventful night of their
painful parting, rang for'admission at
the cottage.
"Ain't in "-said Aunt Lindr, as
she faced him at the door.

grumbled Aunt Linder as she stumbled
-up stairs--" dare ain't no gittin shet of
'im, no how, 'pears like!  I wish ter
de Lord''e was in Kanetuck !" The
old lady had an idea that that State
was just a little the other side of crea-
tion.
" Aint come Sir,'' said the sullen ne-
gress, as she returned to the parlor with-
out even peeping into Myrelda's room.
She knew she was there, but thought
to save her conscience by not seeing
her! Aunt Linder was a professing
christian of the Methodist denomina-
tion, who could sing and shout at a re-
vival,,and turn up her eyes .as~devout-
ly as the colored clergyman himself;
but like a great many more of her race,
and some who can even boast of an An-
glo-Saxon skin she never "stuck at tri-
fles," when she flattered herself the end
would justify the means.
She loved Myrelda and hated Ham-
ilton for the unhappiness she saw he
had occasioned her, and was, she de-
clared, "bent on gettin shet of 'im."
Hamilton turned, without a word,
and left the Vale, and the cottage door-
ball never again vibrated to his touch.
The following day Aunt Linder was
employed in the yard as a little boy pass-
ed through the gate with a letter for
" Miss Myrelda."
"Who sont it, honey ?"querried the
old woman, as she eyed the delicate
missive.S
" 1LMr. Hambletou tolled me to fetch
it, and gin me a quarter dollar, to gin

it to Miss Myreldy"--and the .tninia-
ture edition of Ethiopian darkness held
up the silver treasure exultingly.
"Never mine it, honey; Miss My's
sick abed, an' can't come down, po
thing ! Let me tuck it, chile; I'll car-
ry it ter 'er. honey,'"-and she slipped
it from the boys hand.
" I shan't get any more quarters-
now"-said the little fellow, sadly, look-
ing down at the shining coin. "He
give me heaps iny .bits ter run erran's
fur 'im;. but I shan't git no more,
now !'
"What fu6, chile ?" Aunt Linder's
eyes were wide with interest.
"Kase 'e's, done gone 'way I-went

'is things fur 'im,: and he gin me dis
ere piper to fetch ter Miss Myreldy.
Jack ses 'e specs 'e won't come back no

"Bless de Lord !" ejaculated the old
woman, as she hurried to the kitchen,
and framed the letter into the red hot
stove-" dare, take dat ! I shan't be
bothered with him no more now, nor
boun' to tell no more lies! 'I hopes de

But Myrelda's health did not im-
prove, with the knowledge of Hamil-
ton's departure, nor her reputation
brighten by the circumstance.. Mali-
cious tongues busied themselves with
her fair fame, and envious hearts ex-

long days and nights she watched him

But to see those dear eyes, that had
never looked upon her but with love
and tenderness, closed forever, and laid
under the white shroud and the, coffin-
lid, and hear nevermore the loving tones
of a father's voice, bowed her spirit be-
neath a weight that -seemed pressing
her life out.
The winter wind wailed and shrieked
in fitful gusts around the cottage eaves,

yet Myrelda heeded not the outer world;
a wilder storm raged around the, sable-
draperied temple of her inner life.

an hour previous, and he slumbered
quietly, without a symptom of pain.
His appearance encouraged her to hope
for a favorable result. , Little Edward
Fairfield, the helpless orphan who had
not yet been claimed by his purse-proud
grand-father, lay upon a low couch in
the corner close by ; and Rose was coiled
upon the warm hearth, running through
the land of dreams, with a song in her
olfactories, that required careful nurs-
ing to keep its occasional trumpet blasts
from disturbing the sufferer.I
She was weary and faint, and Aunt
Linder had promised to call her when
her father awoke. She relieved the old
woman's anxiety by obeying her com-
mand. She went up to her chamber,
and lay down without disrobing. Weari-
ness ere long shut her senses to all re-
membrance and realization -of mortal
suffering and endurance.
The shout, as of a thousand voices,
awoke her. She sprang up, mechani-
cally, and stood -a moment in .complete
bewilderment; then, realizing her poci-
tion, she rushed to the window. A
dense mass was collected below, and the
deep boom. of the alarmabell, breaking
through the clatter of flying feet, and
clash of rolling engines, was a sufficient,
explanation. A second shout from the
crowd, swelled above the confused roar,
as the night taper displayed her forin
through the parted curtain-drapery.
Myrelda had left her :chamber door
open, to hear, more distinctly every
sound from her father's room below, as
it came up the stair-way, but the blus-
tering wind had drawn it to,'and caught
the slender bolt.
Myrelda darted towards it;and dashed
into the adjoining chamber, but a ,vol-
ume of smoke and flames surged upthe
stairs, and drove her, half blinded, back.
There was one more hope of eseqpe,

and she bounded to the door opening into
the upper hall, whence, she might de-
scend to the passage below; but a
tongue of liquid fire, streaming through
a rear window, met her half-way the
ball, and she retreated. before it, clos-
ing the door securely, to arrest the pro-
gress- of the raging elements.
She was now effectually walled in,
and no prospect of -escape was before
her. The cottage was constructed of
brick, with a rear addition of wood,
and roofed with combustible material.
Every outlet was barred up with fire,
and soon .the ligneous portions of her
prison, must yield to the fury of the
flames. She abandoned all hope of life,
and committing her spirit to Him who
gave, folded her arms upon her breast,
and looked down upon the babel below
with a strange calmness upon her death-
ly white face.
It was now one o'clock. Let us go
back two hours, to the time of Myrelda's
departure from the bedside of her slum-
bering father.
Aunt Linder ensconsed herself in
the cushioned rocker, and listened
to the weeping and wailing of the
wind, till a sensation of drowsiness
crept over her, and threatened to hang
weights upon her dusky eyelids. She
rubbed her eyes and pinched her arms
to repel the assaults of Morpheus, but
without avail. All was hushed and
solemn within. The lamp glimmered
pale and pensive, over the calm face of-
the patient, and soon she was under
the narcotic influence of her-surround-
ings; Her 'head fell back upon the
cushion-her mouth opened gradually,
to a surprising capaciousness, and Aunt
Linler slept soundly.     -
A hissing and scorching started her
to - her feet. Flames of fire were
streaming through the door, communi-
eating with the kitchen, and rushing

up the stairs, impelled by the draught.
Aunt'Linder's -foot came in swift
.contact with Rosa's head, who started
and screamed at the lurid scene. - Lit-
tle Edward was awakened by the noise,
and rushed for the side door. Aunt-
hinder caught her master in her strong
arms, and rolling*him up tightly in the
quilt, followed upon the children's heels.
She now looked about for Myrelda, and
wrung her hands in an agohy of terror,
when she thought of her perilous posi-
tion.
The old woman plunged for-the door
again, but the flames forced her back,

that shot around the angle, in the bil-
lowy blasts, and beat her froth her post.
She fled to the front door, and with two
tremendous jars, dashed it from its fast-

CHAPTER XV.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow esli--
SiAK$PEA n.
A group was gathered in the Melville
House, lolling here and-there, smoking
cigars, and nodding over the evening
papers, with occasional bite of town
gossip thrown ip to relieve the monotony,
when the stagecoach rattled up, well
laden with.passengers.
The curious eyes of the company
were instantly leveled at the door, to
scrutinize the new-corners, who hurried
in to seek refuge-from the biting win-
ter _ lastt, and among them, Herbert
IIa pltoivery pale and grave, but
itately ;a sen time past:
The whole body of idlers started with
surprise at his sudden appearance, and
Dr. Gerald grew ghostly white.
Mr. Berrien sprang forward with ex-
tepded hnd, and welcomed him back,
with every; demonstration of fraternal
feeling and delight, at his return,;- and
the rotund' 'and jolly landlord bustled
oqt, and grasped his hand with unre-'
stained expresionsof surprise and gl4-
ness.
A smile, gentle but sickly, flitted over
Hamilton's face, as he responded to his
friends' manifestations of pleasure; but
soon it faded out, leaving him pale and
stern, as before.
e' " How now, Dr. ?" inquired the host,
as pr. Merton entered and stared in as-
tonishment at Hamilton, whose presence
he at lengthacknowledged by a cold,
supereillious nod. Not a muscle of
jian ilton's face moved as he returned
it, with one as freeing.
"Bad," the Dr. shook his head om-
inously.-"He can't last much longer-
that's evident. I
"Poor child .1 said the host, glauc-
ing surreptitiously at Hamilton. "Then

she must soon be deprived of her last
friend !  God help her !"-
iAmen l" responded the physician
soleidnly -
" ii s Montford has native strength
sufficient to sustain her in every trial,"
said Mr. Berrien ardently, "Fate may
demolish every earthly prop, but there
is one that can ,never be removed-
faith in the Eternal."
A low, mocking laugh issued from
Gerald's lips at the close of this remark,
and was succeeded by a sober seeming.
and half-frown, as though he were
self-censured for the involuntary act.
All eyes, but Hamilton's, were turned
towards him in a monient; but Gerald
fixed his own, pertinaciously, upon the
grate.'
" All ain't gold that glitters !" laugh-
ed Augustus Smith, a dissolute com-
panion of Gerald, whose reputation for
debauchery and libertinism was far ahd
wide spread. "Eh, Fred' ?"
Gerald turned slowly and silently,
and shut one eye slyly at the speaker,
with a quietness of movement that
seemed to say, he designed the answer
to be observed by the inquirer alone,
but which was really culculated to at.,
tract the notice of all around, by its si-"
lent significance.
Mr. Berrien glanced at Hamilton;
his face was bent over the paper before
him, and be. was apparently unaffected
by the various remarks. Gerald, too,
had marked his calm, unconscious air,
and felt encouraged by his apparentin-
difference. He had feared that Hamil-
ton had returned to renew his suit to
-Myrelda, and resorted to his method to
"sound" his feelings. He became buiy-
ant at the result, and grew more bold
in his iusinuations, without rendering
himself amenable to the law for slander.
.The villiau had always sedulously
guarded against that.

He strode the floor and mused ; sud-
denly he. brought his clenched hand
down, with silent emphasis to some
mental decision; and muffling himself
up in a disguise, he sallied forth into
the wide and windy/darkness.
It :was jus the night for the perpe-
tration of the deed contemplated ; and
no suspicion rould possibly attach to him
as the authpr.
Strode on=and on till the cottage.
gate was attained, and cautiously ad-
mitted himself into the enclosure. All
was still, save the hoarse breathings of
the wind, as it wailed and howled
around him.
A pale light was shining from My-,
relda's chamber window, and he stood
a moment in silent, thought, with old-
time memories clustering about his heart,
and the white wings of the angel of
repentance poised above him.
Howoften, in happy days gone by,
had he. stood thus, beneath the old trees
of her childhood's home, and breathed
his love to her, on the soft, sweet mel-
ody of a midnight serenade. Then he
was free and.joyous; no guilt had-ever
stained;the white leaves of his young
and lovingjife. Now he stood beneath
her lattice, perjured. vindictive and

hope.abandoned,crimsonedwith the life-
blood of her he had so deeply wronged,.
for as he purposed in his heart, so God
imputed the sin to him.
Revenge and jealousy subjugated his,
softer emotions. Hamilton should not-
triumph ! The good angel plumed his:
white wings, and fled away sorrowing,
and the satellite of satan led him cau-
tiously to the sitting-room. The win-
dow-shade was slightly elevated,through
careless drawing, and Gerald scrutiniz-
ed the interior. . He could not have
chosen a more propitious moment for
the execution of his fiendish purpose.
Ali were deep wrapped in slumber,
and the stair-door was thrown wide open.
The flames would speedily bar up that
escape-way; and now the remaining one
was his care.
Gerald was perfectly familiar with
the construction of the cottage. In boy-
hood he had romped through it with a
frolicsome school-ihate, who had now ar-
rived at man's estate, and purchased a.
more imposing home.
He softly shivered a pane in the up.
per window, with a staff appropriated
for the purpose, and applied a match to
the rear of the building. The wild winds
would sweep the flames through the
apperture, and ignite the combustible
parts ere the sleepers awoke, or the
alarm sounded.
Gerald mingled with the startled citi-
zens, when the shout of terror rolled up
.from a thousand lungs, over the con-
fused city ; and none dreamed that the
author of the wild conflagration stood
wrapped in the rich folds and fur of
that costly cloak, as he gazed up at his
innocent victim, looking down upon the
rabble below, hopeless and helpless-
only one !

ering form  closely up to his breast,

awaited its arrival to convey her to Mr.
Berri a's, whither her -ther had been
carried.
CHAPTER XVII.
'thennlet me hold thee today heart,
And every care resign-GoLns tUIr.
Myrelda was now homeless-and desti-
tute; comparatively nothing had been
rescued of their little household wealth,
and they were thrown upon the hospi-
tality of one, related by no ties but mere
friendship; yet as happy a moment she
had never known, as when Hamilton
drew her to his sheltering breast, and
bending his lovedit face tenderly to-hers
murmured: "my own forever."
She had often dreamed how that man.
ly voice,-so calm and cool, and occasion-
ally blunt,' would melt and modulate,
with the outgushing tenderness of affec-
tion, when no longer restrained by in-
comprehensible motives. She had fre-
quently thought of the capacity of that
deep, strong, soul for feeling affection ;
and longed for the moment when' the
secret door of that;hidden heart would
oegeu and. take her to the :great throne
f that inner temple. He was so unlike'
his sex-a rare, unfathomable being ;
he could neither 'love nor hate, lightly.-
His was not a heart, whose stream ,rip-
pled on,. with-a smile and a kiss'for
every fair flower that bloomed beside it,
'with here a glooming shadow, and there
: glittering cascade; but deep, noise-.
less ocean, with its jewels and pearls
hidden far 4ewn from the eyes of men,
beneath th dark, still waters; love with

him, would not merely be one of life's
incidents, but the epoch of his existence
-the Genesis and Revelation of his
heart-volume.
Slhe had never doubted his love, since
the' explanation'" voluntarily given, re-
specting his apparent neglect and indif.
ference,; -nor felt a shiver of distrust,
relative to his intentions, until the night
of their rupture ; nor had that out-lived
the gloomy hours of darkness, and her
wretchedness was augmented, by the
thought of her injustice, and the' fear
that he was too proud to seek a recon-
ciliation.
But now the wild storm that tossed
her life-sea had lulled, and her little
barque safely reached the haven, through
hisfirmness and love, who was dearer to
her than the life he had preserved, and
whom she deemed lost to her irretriev-
ably.
" It is a blessed thought that I owe
my life to ,you, Herbert!"
Hamilton shuddered, as he pressed
her closer in his arms.
"'My God ! if I had not returned !"-
his blood curdled at the thought of her
horrible death, but for his firma.essand
defiant spirit, for Myrelda coulthnot
have escaped, even with the means with-
in her reach, with the flames swelling
over it, without his strength and shield.
,He did not know that but for his re-
turn, she would then be slumbering in
her quiet, unmolested home.
He bent his cheek, caressingly, to
her forehead.
" It is written, 'He shall give His
angels charge over thee'-that is, such
as you, Myrelda. Thank God! you are
all-mine, now, darling!"
- " Heart and life !--you can never
know how dearly I love you, Herbert !"
Hamilton thought he could "guess"
pretty creditably to his Yankee reputa-
tion, when he looked down in her tell-

tale eyes, and felt her modest face hiding
its blushes on his bosom.
But sorew was not yet ended, with
Myrelda, arid the event that gave her to
the arms of Hamilton, as an affianced
wife, deprived her of another love.
Excitement and exposure to the win-
try winds, hastened the closing scene of
Col. Montford's life; and ere the morn-
ing dawned upon the smouldering ruins
of her once lovely and peacefulhome,.
the vital spark had been caught up'
from the aged clay-tenement, to mingle
with the full blaze of eternity; and the.
white drapery of death was drawn over
the mortal habitation ! He died with
Hamilton's and Myrelda's hands folded
together in his. -
"God bless you, my children, an
make, and keep you worthy of Himself.
Herbert, take a father's blessing, and
his best earthly gift-his helpless and
innocent child.. Her lot has been a
hard one-soften her future with your
love, and you will have your reward,
'both in the life that now is and, and
that which is to come.' I can die quiet-
ly now, knowing that my darling has a
home in stronger arms than her feeble
old father's. And you, my daughter,
let the consciousness of duty, faithfullyI
performed, ameliorate your sorrow forE
my loss. Don't grieve for me, my child,
'it is appointed unto man once to die,'
and the winds blow cold around this old
tabernacle; but He will build it up in3
new strength and glory, in that world
where we may meet again. God bless
you both as one, my children ; meet me
there."                             t
He pointed his pale, thin finger to- a
wards heaven feebly, and with a gentle "
pressure of their united hands, and a d
soft sigh, the old soldier of the Cross b
slept peacefully, the 'sleep that knows -
no waking," till the "last trump shall
sound."                             C

Hamilton bore Myrelda half fainting
from the chamber of death, and his
strong soul deliquesced in tears, that
brimmed his dark eyes, but -were re-
strained ,from overflowing by the inner
mandate': "thus far shalt thou go, and
no farther !" at sight of her great grief.
He laid her languid head upon his
breast,and soothed her softly and ten-
erly, as 'a young mother fondles her
first born.
"Oh, lordy, honey I" sobbed Aunt
Linder, as she knelt at their feet, and
mingled her tears with the pale orphan's.
'-Don' cry, chileI he's better off now,
honey.. De Lord's ways is oilers right,

by'n bye1 IDon' ery, chile, you ain' all
'lone in de worl', honey-bless de Lord!''
Myrelda clung to Hamilton convul-
sively, at this allusion, and nestled, her
tearful face closer to his protecting
bosom.
"God is merciful! He has not left
me comfortless ! Oh ! how desolate I
should be without you, Herbert !"
His arms contracted with impulsive
force, around her tiny waist, at this evi-
dence of utterdependence upon him for
earthly hope and happiness. He clasped
the little hand that lay upon his should-
er, and kissed it with tender reverence.
" My life is your defence-my heart
your home. Lean all your helplessness
on me, darling, and give all your care to,
my arms,"
"Oh, lordy ! mars Ham'lton,' cried
he old woman in deep contrition of soul,

Hamiltonlooked down at the white,
thin face upon.his bosom, and the ema-
ciated fork: child-like, in ts .slender
proportions,.lying so trustingly- and
grief-lades in his arms, and the thought
that he had occasioned the unhappiness
that conduced to her..soul touching

"Good God !, my poor darling!"
"Oh ! mars Hubbert, say'you furgive

Hamilton lifted his head-calmly; his

This affectionate outbreak increased
Myrelda's tearm, and hiding her face in
Hamilton's bosom, she laid one hand on
her nurse's shoulder, sobbing: "'.Oh,
aunty !"
. He kindly and gently motioned the
old woman away, and quieted the sor-
rowing orphans with his irresistible tones
of tender endearment. She. dried her
eyes and lookediup.
"What is the meaning of all this,
Hurbert?"
" At another time, you shall know ally

have both been deceived, and kept apart,
by that deception. You are weary now,
little trembler; lay your head on my
bosom again, and try to sleep. I can't
suffer you to leave me yet, darling."
" Only tell .me, Herbert, that you
loved me without distrust!'-she was
thinking of her visit to Mrs. Fairfield.
"Before we met, I loved you, Myrel-
da; and since our first meeting, that
love has grown to spirit-worshipwithout
a shadow of-distrust to cloud its bright-
ness."
She laid her head upon his breast,
with a tearful smile, and with his hand
softly smoothing   her golden-brown
tresses, .she fell asleep. -

liancy of'the burning gas.

a thin snow-shroud folded around his
aged form; and the young anointed
king came in at the midnight hour, and
ascended the throne of his old sire,.to
wield the sceptre of days, over his late
inheritance.
The beautiful city of Arlingford lay
luiet and calm, in the cloudless morn-
ing sun, deserted by the majority of its
inhabitants, for its sister city, the great
centre of gravitation, on each successive
New Year's Dad.
Hamilton and Myrelda sat alone, at
Mr. Berrien's, where it was decided she
should remain until her marriage, at her
friend's urgent request, which was to be
consummated as early as practicable,
under existing circumstances.
Myrelda would have deferred it till
the period of her mourning was ended,
but for her lovers desire to take her un-
der his immediate protection and guar-
dianship; her heart, too, pleaded in behalf
,of a speedy blending of hearts and lives,
by the solemn marriage ritual, and her
lonely position justified it. She was
now recovering from an illness of some
days' duration, superinduced by the re-
cent trying vicissitudes through which
she had passed ; and delicately lovely
she looked, reclining upon Hamilton's
supporting bosom.
Her mourning garb heightened the*
pure transparency of her young, thin
face, and small, waxen hands; and the
red anthracite flushed a soft, faint tint,
like the inner lining of the sea-shell,
upon her cheek. Hamilton's lips, too,
had done something towards making
that modest face "blossom as the rose.
He looked down upon her a moment
in silence, and asked in a serious, half-
incredulous tone:
" How could you ever love that mer-
cenary villai, Myrelda ?"
"Idon'tiknow,lHerbert; I have often
wondereld that I could have been so

egregiously deceived--that I could ever
have thought him all that was noble
and love-worthy in man ! I W9k back
with astonishment and shuddering, to
the time when I stood upon the!brink
of. the precipice; almost upon the eve
of uniting my destiny with his; and
thank heaven for the dark reverse of
fortune that withheld me from that
abyss of misery. Death itself, would be
preferable to a life-union with so heart-
less and perfidious a nature as Frederick
Gerald's !
"And yet you suffered for one so
mean and despicable. I have never
heard it from your lips, or read it in
your private letters; but it breathea in
your published 'articles. No one can
linger there, and not feel that the author.
has passed through 'the valley of the
shadow of death !' And yet you could
smile and go proudly and firmly for-
ward, a 'hero in the strife,' when your
heart was breaking ! I knew it all,
though unknown to you, and pitied and
revered, before I ever loved you, My-
relda,"
"Not for him, Herbert; not forphis
desertion, did I suffer, but from the
dying out of a first love. My fancy
made him all that was true and worthy
-he was my ideal of manly excellence -
and when my idol fell, it crushed an
mangled the spirit-vines twisted so con-
fidingly and closely around him; but I
never grieved for 1dm. Frederice Ger-
ald possessed no power over my heart,
when the certain of duplicity was looped
back from his perfidious soul, and the
nest of vipers stirred up by the rod of
adversity.

Hamiltonlooked down upon her meek;
upturned face; with a soul-full softness
in' his dark eyes that told of reverence,
yet, a shade of' disqiet swept over: his
firm face.
"The furnace of-affliction has refined
the gold of your nature, Myrelda ; you
are too good and pure for earth, much
less for a life.ompanionship with me;
and I marvel now, asI have ever done,
how I could have woni you. You smile
incredulously, and raise your eyes, re-
proachfully; for this disparaging insinu-

do you think me faultless, Myrelda?"
"No, Sir, but as near perfection as
one unimbued by the spirit of divine
grace cafi be.. I never inet your equal,
herbert, among those who are 'under the

feel confident that glorious result will
yet, be effected, because it is written,
'put thy trust iii the Lord, and He
shall give thee the desire of thy heart.'
There would be no luke-warmness-no
retrogression with you, Herbert ;'Â°you
would never 'look back,' when your,
hand was once 'put to the plow;' and
daring all things for the right, you

would be; under such circumstances,
Myrelda, I think you are; and I would
as soon try, with a hope'of success, to
overturn Gibralter, by mere physical
force, as to attempt to shake your faith
in Him, or render you less pure than
now. There ! you are smiling and'blush-

" I care for no other, Herbert. ''
"if I could bring you as skinless a
heart as you have given me, Myrelda, I
should long ago have called you my
wife. You look up in wonder and half
fear! Turn your face this way again,
Myrelda; raise your eyes to mine, and
tell me plainly, do you fear me ?" -
"No, Sir; 'perfect love casteth out
fear."
" God bless you for that, my sweet
girl ! I would believe your simple word
more firmly than others affidavit! I trust
you implicitly, and your moral superi-
ority renders the revelation I have to
make, a painful, even fearful task !"
"'Don't tell me, then, Herbert; I can
trust you for all the past, and the years
that may await us in the veiled future.
We all find something to deplore, when
we look back, in later hours, to the days
of childhood and youth, and you cannot

faith and love, and now that I have
succeeded, they burden me with a fear
for a revulsion of feeling !--and yet, let
the consequences b.e what they may, I
will not deceive you.' I never meant to
do that, Myrelda; yet I wished to make
your heart plead in my behalf, ere I
drew aside the drapery of the past, and
revealed to you the whole life of him
whose destiny now you are willing to
share. When I pledge to you at God's
altar, a husband's love and protection,
I shall not give you a heart with one
niche reserved for the errors and wrongs
of my early life, that I dare not suffer
you to behold. I shall throw open
every chamber of that heart, and show'
you the home I offer you; and if you
will 'then enter in and dwell there,'
your husband's life will be devoted to
your happiness.'
" I will have no other home ,Her-

more of earth, I should fear you less!
Lay your head on my bosom again, and
let me see your face-so; it mirrors
your soul as clearly as a limpid lake
the blue vault above it; and I would
read your heart, as I tell you the tale'
of years that are gone."

"Yes Sir."
" Did you ever speculate on the whyI
and wherefore ?".
"I fancied, Sir, that your heart nev-I

marble white and his broad brow con-

"You tremble, you grow pale, do you

Go on, Sir; your looks unnerve

"I was born amid affluence, and rear-

brother and sister, who have long lain
in their graves. Father, mother, sister
and brother, all died and left me to buf-

attained my twentieth year. My father
was reduced from wealth to poverty by
becoming surety for a faithless. friend,
who absconded and left him to liquidate
the debt,andthusrendered him penniless.
Though but a child of eight years, I
remember it as though it were but yes-

my gentle meek-eyed mother; and I
swore -in my youthful heart, vengeance
upon him who occasioned them. She
was my idol, and .my heart turned to
stone. When a boy of twelve years, I
knelt beside her humble coffin and wept
tears of blood upon her cold, care-worn
face. My father died three years pre-

" Herbert Herbert!' Nyrelda clung
to him, shudderigly, at the calm, firm
tone in which this probable result was
uttered.'
"You' tremble-you twine your little
arms around m, as though they, with
all their frailty, could avert that fate.
Would you save me from it, Myrelda ?"
"I would, Sir, with my life.'
"Without your love, dear girl, your
influence would be lost. I might take
you to my arms, a wife, and love you.
as fondly as now through long years;
but without the knowledge that I held
your- heart in my keeping, your life
would not avail. , I shall never love
you less than now, Myrelda; you may
refuse to unite your destiny with mine,
and cast me off as unworthy, but while
there is a throb of life in my veins, or
strength in this arm, you will have my
love and protection. . Your father com-
mitted you to my care-alas ! he knew.
not whom he was trusting;--and long
as life lasts I will perform a brother's
part, if I may not claim a dearer, a more
sacred title. But the ice.-rust that has
been my;prison from boyhood, will not
break and drop from my soul, without
the warm  sunlight , of your love and
faith. I know my own hardness and
constitutional defects, and have tiied to
correct them; but it is not in my nature
to be pliant and impressible. I love you
more intensely for being shut up from
all the earth, forthe fibres of -my heart
have but one support. You can nevev
tear them fromyou, though you refuse
to train them to loftier heights and sym-

metrical proportions; you may go one,
way, I the other}; the dividing will only-
lengthen not loosenthe vines;'but the
sea-waves of life that wash between us,
will make the heart ache and bleed by
the harsh chafings; and yet, the world,
and you, would never know the inner
anguish that I should endure, for I am
so constituted, Myrelda, that I'd be torn
and mangled limb from trunk, and joint
from joint, before a tear should moisten
my eye, or a sigh heave my bosom, be-
cause of the sad reverses of human life,
or the 'ills that flesh is heir to.' Inever
could yield to that weakness, though
doomed to torture more terrible than the
lost spirits' in perdition undergo. Had
my poor dear mother been spared me, I
should have been a better man; her love
would have kept my soul from petrify-
ing in the cold, subterranean waters of
exclusion and revenge. It was in your
power, girl, to accomplish what she
would have effected; for you are the
first one that has drawn a tear from my'
eyes since I knelt beside her coffin,-
twenty-two years ago ! Love for and
from you, was the golden key to the
prison-house of my incarcerated better-
being. It is sympathy, soul-companion-
ship that I need and seek ; that alone,
can soften"and* melt my iron nature to
purer and holier thoughts and feelings.
Can you give me that, Myrelda, know-
ing to whom you trust it ?"'
" I can, Herbert; 'with all thy faults
I love thee still.' Had not your wrong'
brought its own punishment=-and were
you impenitent ,now, I should fear to
trust you.. Your voluntary confession
betrays 'your noble soul; and while I,
shudder at the enormity of your sin,
I love you more for what you have suf-'
fered.i God pardons the penitent, and
commands us to forgive. You can nev-
er be less dear to my heart, Herbert, till i
you cease to be what you now are."

"And now that you know all, will
you renew your vow; and promise, be-
fore high Heaven, to be niine through
all Time and Eternit ?"
" I will,I do, Herbert !"
Herbert Hamilton drew the lips that
uttered the vow to his own, and her
cheek was moist - with 'the overflowing
tenderness and joy that welled up froma
the great deep of his strong heart, and
brimmed his dark eyes when he hid
her face in his bosom, and bowed"his
head upon her brown tresses.
"G od bless you, dear one, and make
me worthy of you! I know my unwor-
thiness to live 'in a heart where-God
dwells;'I feel the honor and blessing of
possessing such a heart; and one less
pure I would not wish to claim. With
all my guilt and sinfulness, I have ever
shunned the sinful and abhorred crime.
Could I forget that deed, Myrelda, I
should look back upon the past with as
little remorse as most men experience
from retrospection. My dear mother
seemed ever near me, directing my ways
and keeping me from the evil that is in
the world. Strange, that I did not xe-
pent before breaking a heart as pure,
but not as firm and self-reliant as yours."
".Did you feel no compunctions of
conscience, Sir ?-was there no inward
monitor whispering you to desist ?'
" Myrelda, I felt no remorse till my
enemy was in his grave; my enmity ex-
tended not beyond that. I recovered
my father's wealth, and reduced my
poor mother's murderer to the state in
which she died, and I was avenged;
but far less content than when I was
a poor 'charity-boy.'
S"With the announcement of his
death, the first billow of remorse rolled
over my granite heart, and my dead
mother's mild eyes-so like to yours,
Myrelda, both in color and expression--..
seemed reproaching me from the skies;

"XWell, Herbert ?"
" As I told you before, Myrelda, I

would have given the.preference to the
reptile. I resolved to hold myself aloof
for a time, and watch the effect. Â°I could
not think that I was wholly indifferent
to you, and attributed your conduct to
a similar spirit that actuated me ; but.
I was determined to see you at all haz-
ards; nothing less than divine could
have prevented that. I would have gone
through a jungle of hungry wild beasts
and braved the torture of Poe's 'Pit and
Pendulum' to accomplish it ! Since the
dawn of remembrance, Myielda, I have
never formed a fixed purpose but were
it within the compass of indefatigable
energy and perseverence and moral dar-
ing, it was executed.
"I watched daily and hourly for you,
but in vain, until I saw you issue from
Mrs. Fairfield's humble dwelling. I
should have joined you immediately, had
not that demon Ilerald then appeared."
" Let me explain that, Herbert."
" Myrelda, it was explained before
you entered your home."
"How, Sir Y"
"With the knowledge you have of
my constitution, you will not be surpris-
ed when I tell you, that, although a
perfectstranger, not even knowing her
name, I entered Mrs. Fairfield's dwell-
ing and received the particulars from
her dying lips-and had she lived to
bear witness against him, I would have
held him up to the world, as the villain
he is, long ere this,"
" Did you not doubt me even then,
Herbert ?"
" Doubt you, girl ! when I have seen
him cower before the lightning glance
of your unquailing and contemptuous

eye? I would as soon have doubted my
ow.n existence as your purity. Myrel-
da, I could 'see too far through a mill-
stone,' to suppose that mere chance had
brought us together there, a trio; or
that you would not have 'looked before
you leaped,' had the circumstances been
of a criminal nature. I could not per-
ceive the workings of the infernal ma-
chine, to be sure, but I know there were
wire-pullers somewhere   behind  the
screen, and I was 'dead-set' upon ferret-
ing them out."
" If all possessed your spirit, Herbert,
there would be fewer blasted reputations
in the world. and fewer parted hearts.
The world is too proud to 'judge from
the appearance."'
"When appearance may be but the
result of the machinations, of a fiend
incarnate to blacken the white robe of
purity itself. It is to be deplored, My-
relda, that the greatest of all virtues-
CHARITY-is the; least entertained
among men.
"But the result of Gerald's plan was
diametrically opposed to his design, for
it was the means of exposing your se-
cret piety and benevolence. Mrs. Fair-

proved her full appreciation of your in--
trinsic worth.

lips.'Providence had thwarted his fiend

in heart. = He ground his teeth with
jealous rage, as he saw again in memory
the manly arms of Hamilton folde
around the frail form of Myrelda, a
she sprang impulsively forward and fel
upon his breast.

Gerald had witnessed it all, through
the parted curtains of Myrelda's cham-
ber window, and his black heart throb-
bed fasterand anxious brow burned hot=
ter with momentarily increasing excite-
ment lest she should escape through his
rival's agency from the burningbuilding,
To be foiled now after all his bold dar-
ing would be to-doubly madden him.
He had not entertained a thought of
defeat. He felt confident the high winds
and combustible material that partly
composed the building would render all
ingress or egress impossible, when the
alarm was sounded through the silent
city. Myrelda would be stifled ere her
rescue could. be effected through the
only medium of possible escape-her
chamber wii dow.
Gerald stationed himself at a point
that best commanded a view of the
;doomed dwelling and watched eagerly
every attempt of the philanthrophic few
to penetrate to the fire-fortified cham-
ber. A satanic smile of exultation
gleamed through his costly fur collar,
as appearances indicated the impregna-
bility of her living and lurid tomb.
His heart gave a spasmodic bound as
ihe observed Hamilton leap with a tre-
mendous act of volition into the hall;
he quivered with a fearful presentiment
of defeat, as his strong right arm was
raised to fell his detainer and friend,
Mr. layton, and stood aghast as he
flashed up the staircase and disappear-
ed from the -view of the shuddering
'crowd,    Gerald trembled with appre-
t hensiou; Hamilton's very air of invin-
t cible determination stamped the epitaph
- of his demoniac hopes upon his fearful
y feelings. If within the limits of possi-
h bilty, with such a defiant and herculean
y nature to shield her, Gerald felt, in his
d secret soul she would escape unscathed.
s    His shrinking spirit expanded some-
l .what as he saw the burning linen hurl-

ed through the lattice ; it betrayed the
fearful condition of the apartment.-
They could not possibly survive but a
few minutes longer without some means
of descent from  the window supplied
by the citizens; and Gerald's watchful
eye encouraged the hope and belief that
that could not be obtained in time suf-
ficient to save them from the devouring
element. He had heard Mr. Berrien's
stentorian lungs shouting "a ladder! a
ladder I" as he flew by with a rapidity
that bore ample testimony to the ex-
citement and solicitude of his generous
and noble soul, but Gerald flattered him-
self, from the appearance of the build-
ing that all would be ended before one
could be procured. His soul died with-
in him when he saw .Hamilton's prepa-
rations for escaping from the chamber
-he had not thought of that means-
but his spirit rose to the achme of fe-
licitous certainty when they fled from
the red tongue that protruded through
the lattice. The fiend incarnate did not
know that ere Hamilton braved the
flames, or Mr. Berrien's voice rang out
upon the wintry air, suggestion of the
last resort, another had shot of,upon
the same errand of mercy.
Crazy Joe was among the first.who
started from their couch of dreams, and
rushed to the scene of ruin. Joe stri-
ded up the stairs as far as he dared ven-
ture for constitutional timidity, and with
a yell of horror and anxiety, he darted
back again into the open air, and look-
ed up at Myrelda. Possessing all the
mental weakness of a child, fear and
pity, occasioned by the scene, overcame
him, and, he burst into tears and loud
lamentations. .,Suddenly starting, like
a streak, from his position, he brotht
one sledge-hammer fist hard down upon
the brown palm of his left hand, with
the screech: "dog me.!" and went. at
the rate of ten knots, from the burning

building. No one regarded the "crazy
boy's" movements. Joe's race was de-
cidedly Gilpin. His tow hair stood out
straight behind, and his big brown
hands beat the air swiftly, as they
swung back and forth, as a means of
propelling power. His dilapidated wool
hat was carried away by the velocity of
his movements, in conjunction with the
rushing winds, but he heeded it not.--
In his hasteto arrive early at the point
of gravitation, Joe had neglected to tie
the stout leather strings that held his
heavy cowhides to his mammoth pedal
dexters, and now, as he ran, one pegged-
bottom  kine envelop popped off his
hoseless track-maker, and left him stark
barefoot upon the frosty giound. Joe
gave a tremendous kick with the other
peregrinator, and ejected the remaining
shoe with such- force and momentum,
that it flew up and grazed his ear, as
he dashed by it, muttering to himself:
" Go to grass, ole shoes ! yer ain't
nuthin' but a nuisness, no how. I kin
run ten times faster without ye-dog
me!    Poor little thing !  Hamilton's
gone, too; an' I'm boun' ter git'er out,
by !"
Now Joe was a strict religionist, and
never failed to repent in "sackcloth and
ashes," for every involuntary act of pro-
fanity, when the excitement that occa-
sioned it had subsided; and there he
was, eminently superior to thousands of
his sex who could boast a clearer and
loftier intellect. Joe was an official
member of the Second Presbyterian
Church-that is, he pumped the wind
into the big organ regularly every Sab-
bath, and was as proud of his sta-
tion as a carpenter's canine with a rule
in his mouth; and considered himself
entitled to all the immunities of the
church militant, simply from this fact;
but Joe forgot his religion on the pres-
ent occasion, and the fortl1den word

ry circumstances, Mr. Berrien's gener-
ous heart instigated him to make'the
proposition as a means of bringing his
friend into a more rapid and. extensive
practice, through his wide-spread name
and reputation, and though indifferent
relative to the compensation to be
awarded his professional services, Ham-
ilton's sole object was to win a distin-
guished name in the land of Myrelda's
birth. He acceded gratefully, detecting
the secret motive of the noble minded
man ; also the co-partnership would
bring him nearer the temporary home
of his betrothed bride.
"Heard the news ?" inquired the jo-
vial, rubicund-faced  landlord, as he
bustled into the room  and rubbed his
hands together over the warm stove.
"Yes, Sir ; the Dutch have taken
Holland"-said Hamilton, as he looked
up from the paper with a remarkably
sober countenance, but a dash of hu-
mor in his dark eyes-"anything more
of importance ?"
"Out upon your Yankee witticism,"
laughed Boniface-"no, no, 'Squire;
something of more consequence, by con-
siderable; a case of slave abduction by.
Northern abolitionists, in our very town,
I'm told."
"Possible !" returned Hamilton, with
a steady, thoughtful glance at his in-
terlocutor.
Gerald's face colored with animation
and measure.
"Can't expect anything better, so
. long as we permit the -knaves to
come among us. I'll swear if it were
my slave I'd ferret out the villain at all
hazards, and pursue him to the ends of
the earth, even for the sake of doing
the South a service, by stretching his
rascally Yankee neck !"
All eyes turned upon Hamilton. at
this fiery remark, and intended insult;
even Mr. Berrien had ceased his con-

versation and looked attentively on ;
but Hamilton sat calm and unaffected,
seriously regarding the landlord, ap-
parently unconscious of Gerald's pres.
ence even. His whole air reminded Mr.
Berrien of Esop's fable of the fly and
the ox.
" I'd like to see the rascal strung up
blamed-well," said boniface ,giving his
stout fingers another vigorous twist over
the stove, "but hang me if I can tell
whether it would be a southern or a
northern neck stretched by the opera-
tion. If the slave has been decoyed and
sold to replenish the purse of a bred-
and-born Virginian, it won't be the first
instance of the kind upon record ; but
it comes natural to give the credit of
such anioutrage to Yankee abolitionists
and the burden of the sin is, by com-
mon consent, laid upon their shoulders
till factstoss it over in a pro-slavery di-
rection."
"Then nothing positive is ascertain-
ed relative to the affair, and no one
specially implicated ?" remarked Mr.
Berrien.
" Nothing definite, as yet, though
suspicion rests upon your friend Wilde-
man, Mr. Hamilton, who left for New
England, yesterday. That garrulous
and ubiquitous individual, They say,
asserts that the fugitive is now en route
for New York under the protection of
his abolition friend, and officers Burley
and Bragg are .in hot pursuit in that
direction."
Hamilton's paper had gradually drop-
ped to his knee during the landlord's
last communication.  The red blood
mounted swiftly to his forehead, his
black eyes flashed indignant fire, and a'
curl of ineffable soul-gontempt and su-
preme disgust, became distinctly visible
about his stern, proud mouth. He sat
silent a moment, steadily regarding
mine host, then answered calmly, while

his countenance resumed its former
quiet and gravity.
"Where intimately known, and right-
ly appreciated, Mr. Wildeman is above
suspicion; yet under the circumstances,
I can't be much surprised that his hon-
or should be more than questionable,since
human nature is prone to suspect even an
honorable man, when decieved by one
of his class or nation. It is a lamentable
fact that villainy is not limited by geo-
graphical boundaries; and in Yankee-
lund there are ignoble minds,-and soft-
head meddlers, who have sought to drop
the match of officiousness in the maga-
zine of Southern rights, and individual
dignity, to explode the National har-
mony. But Charles Wildeman don't
rank in that category, as the result of
this pursuit will most assuredly demon-
strate. It can't be expected that we
Yankees should be pro-slavery men;
the very nature of the circumstances
under which we are reared, forbids it;
but the honorable men of the North,
while opposed to the system of traffick-
ing in human flesh and blood, are equal-
ly averse to the activity of professed
philanthropists to break the chains of
slavery by compulsion; which effort, the
past has proven, but rivets them the
tighter; and their continued exertions,
despite the result of former labors,
show conclusively, that they are not
actuated by a spirit of true philanthro-
py; for I call that a doubtful exhibition
of the principle, where discord and
animosity follow in its steps. In the
language of one of your fair and gifted
townswomen, the worthy portion of the
North, of which Mr- Wildernan is em-
phatically one, believe that in the full-
ness of time 'the dear God who loveth
us, who made and loveth all,' will re-
veal His will concerning that which is
fermenting the public mind. .If the ef-
fort to free our slaves, be of men, it

will come to nought, but if it be of God
we cannot overthrow it;' and the time
will come when the Moses of Conscience
will lead the Black Host over the blue
Atlantic, and land them safely, upon
their own native soil. But if your ra-
bid ultras lay the flattering unction to
their'souls that Southerners are going
to submit to their dictation, they'll be
just as much mistaken as the old lady
was when she knocked her pudding off
the table and said: 'scat!"'
"Ha ! ha !" laughed the fun-loving
landlord, rubbing his hands together
like the grating of corn-shucks-"good.

Hamilton-no mistaking that source !
she gave me a shot once that hit just in
the right place to be memorable !
"Do me the favor to relate it, ifyou
please, that I may know if your suspi-
cions are correct "-said Hamilton, with
a slight smile about his softened mouth.

A roar of laughter followed this nar-
ration; excited;mainly, by the landlord's
inimitable manner of relating a joke.
Hamilton's face reddened and radiated-

with spirit-light, and a slight tremor of
mirth agitated his strong frame , but it
was a remarkable fact that he had nev,-
er been heard to laugh since his resi-
dence in.Arlingford.
Mr. Berrien's gay voice was distinct-
ly heard, as he brought his hand down
upon his nearest neighbor's knee with
a force that made him flinch, exclaim-
ing:
"Served you right, old fellow, be
hanged! No mistaking that source.-
I defy any one to run afoul of that craft
and- not get a broadside that will heave
him keel upwards. I say, . Hamilton,
isn't he correct ?"
Hamilton turned, with sparkling eyes.
" Undoubtedly; I recognize the au-
thor of that, as she to whom I referred.
It is characteristic of her independent
and sarcastic nature, when the provoca-
tion is sufficient to call forth a Greek to
Greek collision. My head has often-
times gravitated beneath the weight of
her ready wit and stinging sarcasm,
with astonishing rapidity, with all my
'Yankee impudence and professional
brass,' as she terms it"-a broad sun-
shiney smile overspread his softly flush-
ed face.
All eyes, but Gerald's were brimful
of mirth at this facetious remark of the
acknowledged lover and bridegroom
elect. Gerald's eyes flashed fierce fire
beneath his heavy black brows, and a
mortal palenes swept over his cold face.
The watchful landlord observed his ex-
pression by an askance glance, and shut-
ting one eye"'significantly, at the amused
Hamilton, returned, laughingly:
"Â«And so 'Squire, to obviate future
concussions between you Yankee caput
and terra firma, you mean 'to have and
to hold' her invincible ladyship, in
bonds of everlasting 'love honor and
obedience,' and so beconte a slaveholder
in spite of principle."

"On a small scale,'' replied Hamil-
ton, entering into the landldrd's lively
spirit. "I would make facts positive
an individual screen, and thus escape
the annoyance of being overhauled by
Messrs. Burley and Bragg, during a
northward tour."
" Humph !" grunted Gerald, unable
longer to restrain his boiling rage,
"Southrons are too familiar with such
villainous Yankee pretences, to be de-
ceived by yours."
All faces, even the lively landlords,
grew sober at this malicious remark, in
evident apprehension of a scene-all
but Hamilton's. The harmony of his
features remained undisturbed, and he
turned his eyes quietly, but piercingly,
upon the enraged and jealous Dr. The
smile about his lips changed into a curl
of' contempt, as he replied with cool
sarcasm : .
" It is said that experience teaches
wisdom; but you, Sir, evidently haven't
learned the lessons taught in that school,
notwithstanding your long pupilage ;
otherwise you would perceive more clear-
ly, what vast discredit your unprovoked
enmity to me reflects upon you, as a man
and a husband."
Gerald sprang from his chair, furious
with passion at this cutting insinuation,
and rushed madly towards the speaker.
The solemn-visaged landlord and Mr.
Berrien obstructed his way to his calm
and scornful tormentor, who leaned
against the wall with perfect sang froid,
awaiting the manifestation of his furi-
ous foe's design. Hamilton waved aside
his friends, as he said quietly:
"No interference gentlemen, if you
please. I'm forced to the conclusion
that it -emains for me to teach that
worthy son of Esculapius a little dis-
cretion and common sense, in both of
which he is sadly deficient; and it
would be a charity to the ignorant gen-

tlenian to proceed with the lesson forth-
with."
Gerald writhed with firy, and burst-
ing from his captors, plunged wildly
forward, and snatched a pistol from his
breast.
Hamilton's quick eye detected the
movement of the madman's hand, and
ere he could direct the deadly weapon
his strong fingers shut like a vice around
Gerald's wrists. He held the enraged
Dr. at arm's length, as he said cooly
and gravely :
" Citizens of Arlingford, you are wit-
nesses of the murderous design of the
imprisoned gentleman, and I request
that a message be despatched to the
Sheriff, while I deliver an extempore
address to this quivering culprit."
He fixed his piercing eye upon the
struggling villain, and continued in the
same cool and tormenting tone :
" My honorable Sir, as you see, I
might now inflict corporeal punishment
upon you, so far as physical superiority
is concerned ; both for your wrongs to
an innocent and helpless woman, and
your past insolence to, and present wan-
ton atack upon me; but I regard it as
far beneath my dignity to chastise one
so contemptible and infamous as your
musked and pomatumed physicianship,
and prefer handing you over to the un-
gloved fingers of the law, to do the. dir-
ty, but most commendable job for me.
I have the pleasure and now take the
liberty to inform you that since my
fist knowledge of your character, which
was long before I ever saw your merce-
nary lordship, I have looked upon you,
whenever I look upon you at all; for
you are so far beneath the level of a
man, that but for your fice-like obstre-
perousness (which will sometimes attract
the notice of larger dogs) I should not
have strained my ocular vision suffi-
ciently to become familiar with your
physiognomy."

EU. .-77

An unavoidable laugh broke, with a
smothered sound, from the listeners, at
the peculiar language and manner of
the speaker, which was, by far, more
tormenting to Gerald, than the heartiest
kicks and cuffs would have been. Ham-
ilton's method of castigating his foe,
was as novel as effective; it "bit like a
serpent, and stung like an adder," and
awarded him a greater victory over his
assailant, than gutta percha canes, or
Colt's revolvers could have achieved.
The convulsed landlord held his nose
and slipped behind Gerald to escape ob-
servation. An irrepressible smile flitted
over Hamilton's face- at the ludicrous-
ness of the scene. Gerald writhed and
struggled desperately, to escape the iron
grasp upon his arms, and finding it a
fruitless effort, he directed one patent-
leather boot at his custodian's knee, *ith
a malignant force that would have floored
him, by destroying his equilibrium, but
for the support of his captor, whose
watchfulness and agility foiled the mis-
creant's motive. Hamilton smiled again
as he proceeded with his sarcastic ad-
dress.
"My pugnacious Sir, I am not a bit
surprised by this maneuver, singe it is
the natural resort of all descendants of
the long-eared animal, that once crushed
Balam's leg through overwhelming
fright, as you fain would mine ; to which
species you have but given one more
evidence of your near relationship."
A burst of laughter ensued, that only
enraged and confused Gerald the more;
and curses loud and deep were heaped
upon his victor's head, Hamilton stood
calm and silent, till his victim's seeth-
ing and surging rage had effervesced in
a torrent of fierce imprecations, and
vulgar abuse. He then bowed with
mock respect, and continued his two-
edged sword slaughter.

the plain, but good old piece of advice,
'look before you leap,' you would not,
now, be in this most mortifying and
torturing position; but 'self-prese'vation
is the first law of nature,' and you must
pardon me for taking the precaution to
protect a life that is, just now, of two-
fold importance, as it holds the hopes
and happiness of another, which is of
more value, by far, than a thousand
such lives as you have sought to des-
troy.- Your past villainy to her has not
sufficed your fiendish soul, but you still
seek to agonize her woman's heart
though me. You have yet to learn the
nature; of. your adversary, Frederick,
Gerald; you flatter yourself that be-
cause I have disdained to flagelate you
for your past intended insults-and here
allow me to inform you, that it is not in
your power to insult me, Sir-that you
can still pursue your unmanly and das-
tardly course with impunity.' Individ-
ually, I have the most profound con-
tempt for your craven lordship; for none
butan arrant-coward will conceal deadly
weapons about his pusillanimous person,
in a civilized community; and your petty
efforts to provoke me, I regard with utter
indifference. After what Iknow of you,
my 'bravoSir, I deem you capable of
any sly deed'of darkness; and feeling
assured you will not again assault me
openly, since you have learned your
helplessness in my grasp, the assassin s
steel will probably do the work that
pur-blind passion has this day attempt-
ed"
Gerald's guilty conscience made him
wiuce at this insinuation. The power-
less gentleman had frequently essayed to
drown his antagonist's voice,'by loud
imprecations and defiant language; but
Hamilton poured forth a steady stream
of distinct words, that confused his
ideas, and rendered him passive before
the oily flood. Hamilton saw his quail-

ing eye, and regarded him sternly a
moment in silence.
"I detect Huilt in your countenance,
my worthy Sir, but shall pursue the even
tenor of my way, fearless of your blood-
thirsty design, and regardless of your
malice. So.far as I am concerned, per-
sonally, you will be as though you were
not; but should you continue your per-
secutions to her, whom it is' my pride,
happiness and privilege to protect and
defend, and, your jealous malignity
should affect her peace of mind or per-
'sonal security, while there is vitality in
my veins, 1 will pursue you to the ut-
termost parts of the earth for vengeance,
and though you sat upon the National
throne, I would press through an army
of bayonets and drench that throne in
your villainous heart's blood, in defiance
of all the steel in the universe of God!"
Gerald cowered before the blaze that~
flashed upon him from Hamilton's fierce
eye and crimsoned face. The company
looked upon each other in silence and
wonder. Hamilton turned to the Sheriff
as he entered the room, and said, coolly:
"For a wanton attempt upon my life, I
deliver Dr. Frederick Gerald &amp; your
custody, Sir, for trial, according to law."
The stout functionary laid his hand
upon the culprit's arm, and marched
him off, fuming and livid with rage and
deep mortification. Gerald was bound
over to keep the peace, in the sum ,of
$10,000, his brother-in-law becoming
bondsman.
The landlord dropped into a chair,
and sraightened himself out at full
length, while his corpulent person shook
convulsively, with long smothered mer-
riment, after Gerald's departure.
"Gad!t if that don't take the rag off
the bush-ha ! ha I Say 'Squire, he !

than stand in Gerald's boots and be

A  few  hours subsequent. Gerald's
dissolute friend and  associate, Augus-
tus Smith, emerged from Gerald's office,
bearing a challenge from the enraged
Dr. to Herbert Hamilton.

POLLOK.
The afternoon of the same day, Ham-
ilton sat in his office alone, preparing
for an approaching County Term to be
held at Fairville, ten miles distant from
Aringford, where he had recently been
licensed to practice his profession, since
his association with Mr. Berrien. It
was to be his debut in his legal capaci-
ty, and as thp fame of his abilities had
preceded him, Hamilton labored to sus-
tain it in - propria personae.,lie was
absorbed for the accomplishmentwof
this o1 ect, when Smith entered, un-
ceremoniously, with a pompous air,
meant to impress Hamilton with an
overwhelming sense of his superiority,
and presented the challenge.
Possessing a knowledge of his character'
both from rumor and observation Ham-
ilton;had ever avoided contact with the
unprincipled masculine, and passed him
by in silence and unnoticed. Thrust
now into his immediate presence, with-
out will or desire on his part, he receiv-
ed. him with coolpoliteness, that every
well-bred man will evince, under all cir-
cumstances, and waved him with grave
dignity to a chair, previous to examin-
ing the contents of the aristocratic look-
ing note.
Smith dropped indolently upon a

chair, with a yawn of seerliing indiffer,
ence respecting the facts in the case, or
the individual presence; then swinging
the right foot upon the left knee, heloll-
ed back as far as prudence dictated, and
tapping the farthest boot-toe, with his
gold-mounted rattan, whistled an ac-
companiment; thus betraying his vul-
garity and plebian blood, by a show of
independence and monied superiority.
Incensed by Hamilton's indifference-
concerning his august person, and en-
vious of his fame, he had honored \him
with the distinguishing titles of "green
Yankee," and "lie-for-a-living," and at-
tached himself to Gerald's cause with
a zeal inspired more by wounded self-
.sufficiency, than friendship for-the Dr.
He was an ardent abettor of the pres-
ent plot, that contemplated Hamilton's
life; for despite the disparity in their
pecuniary circumstances, as he fancied,
like Haman of old, his supposed supe-
riority in that respect availed him noth-
ing, "so long as he saw Mordecai, the
Jew sitting at the king's gate."  He
watched Hamilton's countenance nar-
rowly, as he perused the note, and was
rather disconcerted by its expression;
but his spirit rose ere long, from a most
tormenting depth into which he was
quite unexpectedly plunged,
Hamilton- laid the letter open upon
the desk-lid, and turned gravely to his
visitor ; brought. one polished boot over
the instep of the other foot, folded his
arms, and leaned in proud majesty
against the desk.
Smith's eyes swept from his head to
his feet rapidly; he took him all in, in
an instant. His delicate rattan ceased
its tattooing "right suddenly; his chair
tilted forward, and the impertinent
whistle became indistinct, as his right
foot slid silently to the floor. The su-
percilious, self-complacent air of the
bigot and fop, was superceded by the

A large crowd was collected before
the Vale, and the auctioneer mounted
upon an elevation stood ready to begin
operations.
"'Twont fetch much," said a bystan-
der--"worst time in the world to put
up property. Its a downright disgrace
to rob that poor child of the last cent.
I'd go six thousand myself if I'd the

-he terms of sale-one-fourth cash,
the remainder six, twelve, and eighteen

and the bids slowly increased from one
to fifteen hundred dollars.

coolly.

The bald-headed emigrant from. La

surprised and mortified face, bent down
and laying his hands upon his knees,
shook his little fat person, with a genu-
ine whole-souled French laugh.

brimful of mirth at the   scene, but
struggled to repress it-' He caught his
associate's hand, and drew 'it quickly
within his arm.
"Come, let us get out of this, or I
-shall explode, to Gerald's indignation-!
No need of going yonder, as we are not

Hamilton drew hiih back and followed
'the moving mae.
"I Wish to attend tkct sale, by all

his dark eyes, that 'aroused his com-

"Going to play em another Yankee

mirthful twinkle of his blue eyes.\
"That, is my design; and if the sale is
slow, I wish you to oppose me to the
full value of the property."
Mr. Berrien's orbs expanded with
amazement.
"For whom do you act ?" he asked, im-
pulsively.
"'For myself; lam going to have that,
for Myrelda's sake," said Hamilton, in a
tone that well nigh rooted Mr. Berrien
to the spot.
" That ! why it's w6rth twenty thou-

hand. They stood now, in the broad,
beautiful grove surrounding Mr. Lynn's
residence. Mr. Clyde stood near them,
and on perceiving their proximity,turned
and entered into conversation respecting
the object of convention.
" I should like-to purchase the place
myself," said Clyde pompously. "But
they're'the meanest, cussedest terms ever
heard of in creation ! Who the devil
does Lynn think can finger twenty thou-
sand dollars ofa winter morning, in such
money-tight-times as these ? I'm told
he values it at twenty thousand, and
won't let it go for less, though he only

" Ten thousand," cried Smith as the
sale progressed.'
"I'll go one more, by - ,!" said
Clyde, with a remarkably red face. "I
want the place, and must have it, if
possible. Five hundred more !" he cried.
Smith ran him to twelve thousand,
notwig standing .his assertion to ihmn-
ilton and his associate.
"I'll be cussed if I go another cent,"
growled Clyde, pulling up his shirt-col-
lar with a nervous jerk, and firing a ful
shot of molassas-colored saliva into the
drenched leaves. Mr. Berrien glanced
at Hamilton, and rubbed his nose to
Screen his niirthful countenance,
"Twelve thousand ! twelve thousand!
only twelve thousand, gentlemen! who
gives us another bid ?-dirt cheap!-
ody twelve thousand ! Going, going!

"Thirteen thousand," said Mr. Lynn,
brother of the proprietor. Smith op-
posed him to fourteen.
" And that's my last," said ho angrily.'
"I shan't give him one dollar more ! He
didn't pay that by four thousand, and
the terns wern't cash, at that !"
Th' bystanders laughed at Smith's in-
dignation. The Crier reiterated Mr.
Lynn's opposition bid, and proceeded to
go ing, g-o"
"Fifteen thousand," said 'Hamilton
distinctly.
All eyes turned upon hit in aston-
ishinent. He stood calm and grave, and
took the fire manfully. Clyde's look of
'wonderment finally changed to one of
*njrth.
"You're caught there, Sir !" he said
to Hamilton, laughingly,  "A burnt
,child dreads, the fire, and Gerald won't
leap into that trap !"
Hamilton smiled. Gerald turned to-
wards him haughtily, with a look of
ritunph,
"I As I don't want this property, you

may have it, so far as I am concerned."
1 Thank you," returned Hamilton,
with a Chesterfieldian bow, and touch-
ing his hat politely to the Dr.
- The race was 'now between Hamilton
and the proprietor's by-bidder. Lynn,
the proprietor, looked over at his an-
tagonist in amazement, at each succes-
sive opposition ; he had mounted him-
self upon oie of the numerous rustic
benches in the wide grove, to obtain a
fair view of his countenance, and scru-
tinized  him sharply. Hamilton was
forced ,to exert his strong will to the
utmost to maintain a grave aspect. The
contest was even and moderate between
the belligerants. Hamilton intention-
ally bid but little above Lynn, to pro-
long the fun.
Who the devil is' he ?" asked the
fat man who insulted crazy Joe, at the
Lyceunm. "Thought he was poor as
Job's turkey !"
"So did I!" returned his interlocu-
tor. "knuess there's an understanding
between'em. It won't fall on his hands.
I'll wager; he can't pay twenty thou-
sand to save him from the old fellow's
cauldron I" The speaker was Gerald's
brother-in-law.
" Nineteen thousand," cried Lynn.
"Nine hundred and ninety-nine dol-
lars and one cent more'!" said Hamil-
ton, with a queer compresson of his
firm lips. A laugh went up from the
crowd at this bid.
"Ninety-eight  cents  over  that,"
laughed Lynn.
"Twenty thousand."
"Twenty thousand, twenty thousand!
Going-at twenty thousand dollars, twen-
ty thousand, twenty, twenty, twenty
thousand ! Once, twice, t-h-r-e-e times.
Herbert Hamilton, Esq !" shouted the
Auctioneer, with a broad smile, as he
brought his hammer down,

Mr. Lynn sprang from his elevation,
and hastened to his successor.
Do you purchase for 'yourself, or
another ."'
"For myself, sir" replied Hamilton,
with an irrepressible suile at Lynn's
expression;- 'and if you will accompa-
ny me to the office, we will settle it
forthwith."
Clyde turned and looked about him,
and went up to the bewildered Gerald
and Smith.
I'll be cussed if' I ever was ao con-
founded in the days of my life," he
said, emphatically.
It's a  ---- Yankee cheat "--re-
turned Gerald, fiercely, "he'll never
get possession of. this place !" and his
mad eyes swept with envious rage over
the beautiful residence. "He's going
to settle the business now, at any rate,"
responded Clyde, as he haoked after the
retreating flanilton, Beri'ien and 1Lnn,
with Joe following hard behind, toss
ing up a quarter triumphantly, the gift
of his benefactor.       -
Joe had uttered a yell that shook the t
tree-boughs above him. as the property
was knocked off to Hamilton, and turned
a delighted summersault, that landed
him plump in Mr. Clyde's tobacco-pud-s
die. Joe picked himself up, with a h
scramble and grunt, and catching hold v
of the seat of his breeches, with finger o
and thumb, twisted his short neck to a
the rear, to view the mischief done, ex-
clhimiug with a rueful visage. that con- s
vulsed the crowd : "Ef I hain't spilte a

arrived at the nearest confectionary. i

maid Gerald, mentally, as he left the 1

Mr. Clyde entered the room where
Mabel sat at the piano, practicing a
new song, and Lora-lay upon an estrade
in dishabille, weeping over Eugene
Sue's story of "Woman's Love." It
coincided with Lora's ideas, point blank;
she, too, would imitate the example of
the hapless heroine, and plunge into the
ocean-waters in the very spot at which
he went ,down, under similar circum-
stances. There was something so no-
ble. in the sacrifice ! She had no doubt
but Sue's heroine went up from a wa-
tery grave, to Paradise, on the wings of
angels ! She thought Sue a very mor-
al writer, and admired his lady's con-
tancy, and deep devotion, and wept for
her unfortunate fate; when the truth
was, Lora Clyde was no more capable
f loving truly and disinterestedly than
parrot was of teaching French.
" Guess who bought the Lynn place,"
aid Mr. Clyde, as he dropped down
mid the velvet cushions, elevated his
eet upon the fender, and fired a tre-
mendous quid into the grate, through
is knees.
"Theodore Clyde, Esq." said Lora,
ith a smile of proud satisfaction, start-
ng up, forgetful of Sue's model hero-
ie.
Not exactly. Guess again."
" Now, Pa. didn't you buy that charm.

ing residence, as you promised ?" in-
quired Lora, in a tone of peevish dis-
appointment, dropping upon afanteuil,
and looking up promptly, at the old
gentleman.
" I'll be cussed if I did !" said Clyde,
laying himself back, at full length, and
squirting a fresh mouthful of Virginia
abstraction towards the grate ; half of
which fell short of"its destination, and
lodged upon the hearth, in a black pool.
"Guess again."
But Lora felt no disposition to com-
ply; she was too disappointed and an-
gry, and sat silent and sullen. Mr.
Clyde looked towards Mabel, who re-
clined against the piaio, with one hand
supporting her graceful head, the other
playing with her watch-chain,
"Come, Bell, try your powers; what
the deuce are you smiling at so myste-
riously ?"
" At the memory of my dream, last
night, of which I have been reminded
since you came in, Pa," replied Mabel,
laughingly.
" Oh, the devil take your dream !--,
That's nothing to do with the question.
Guess who bought the Lynn place, I
say."
" Well, Pa, I'll make a .wild guess,
and say, Mr. Hamilton."
Clyde started bolt up ight in amaze-
ment, while Lora sent forth a loud laugh
of derision.
"What the, Beelzebub made you
think so ?" Clyde stared at her in
blank astonishment.
" I didn't really think so, Pa; I only
-I guessed from-it may not be Mr.
Hamilton, but I reckon the sale will
put it again in Myrelda's possession,"
Mabel blundered and blushed.
"Well, I'll be blown to the farthest
corner of creation, if that don't get over
me !" said Clyde, dropping down again
and emphasizing his declaration, by

ejecting a yard-long stream of saliva,
into the hissing fire.
"Who was it, pa ?" urged Lora, now
doubly curious, from the old gentle-
man's appearance.
" Who ! why I'll be cussed if the
girl hain't guessed it."
Lora now sprang to her feet, me-
chanically, and half screamed in her
excitement:
"Pa, Hamilton, didn't buy     that
place ?"
" Cuss me if he didn't !" said Clyde,
giving a squirt through his fingers to-
wards the grate, that shot over and
plastered the mantel.
" Herbert Hamilton buy that elegant
home !" Lora ftad dropped down again,
and sat looking very white and seriously
at the crimson coals. "What did he
pay for it Y"
".Twenty thousand dollars,every cent
of it." Mr. Clyde gave the fender an
impulsive punch, that made it rattle, as
he thought of his own defeat.
" Twenty-thousand dollars ! Herbert
Hamilton pay twenty thousand dollars!
Never ! It's a cheat, Pa; he ain't worth
it."  Lora was walking the floor, pas-
sionately.
"I'll be cussed if I don't believe he
is. I always saw something in him a
little remarkable." said Clyde, laying
back, and inserting his hands to the
lowest depths of his trowsers pockets.
Mabel had left the piano stool, and
was going round the room in a graceful
waltz, with a queer smile upon her red
lips. Lora looked daggers at her slen-
der form as it floated over the carpet.
" You seem transported with~ the
news, Miss Clyde," she said sneeringly.
"I am, Loo. The wronged are now
righted. I love to see the righteous
triumph." A clear laugh gushed troi
her small mouth.
"-It's the greatest piece of romance I

9             HERBERT hA ILTON;

ever read of in any novel," remarked
Clyde, half laughing, half mortified.-
"I don't know how he could contain
himself so long. I couldn't a-done it.
I should a-let the cobbler out long ago,
and showed Smith I wasn't such a poor
' lie for a living' as he supposed. I
reckon Guss will feel a little streaked
after this. He looked like a sheep
killing dog when Hamilton bid it off.
Poor fellow ! I wouldn't be in his shoes
for his stockings. Hamilton was the
most important nfan in town before the
knowledge-of his wealth, and now he'll
stand upon the highest round of the
ladder. Money will give a fellow a
boost in public estimation, I don't care
what his talents or intellectual powers
are. ' Money makes the mare go' a
little faster. Well, I'm glad I always
treated him as a gentleman in spite of
his supposed poverty ;. and npw I want
you to pay him every attention, and his
bride elect, too. It won't do to be be-,
hind the times. Belle, you are on
terms of friendship with her, and if Lo
had had half sense she would have sent
Myrelda an invitation to that last party,
and kept her temper down. I am
afraid Hamilton will never forgive that
slight, for he's heart and soul given to
the girl, and any insult to her will flash
through him like lightning. His de-
votion to her is the town talk. Henley,
who was present at the time of Gerald's
assault, told me that Hamilton swore if
the Doctor hurt one of her little fin-
gers, he'd deluge the whole earth a mile
deep in his villainous heart's blood, if
he had to go through hell after him,
and every sword and dagger in creation
were to be thrust through him for the
murder, or something like that equally
strong. Gerald's the biggest fool in
Christendom, and his wife the greatest
dupe, 'She's jealous enough, the Lord
knows; but the Doctor plays his cards

well and could make her believe the
earth stood-on a terrapin's back if he'd
give her a kiss with the assertion.-
Some women are weak cisterns, and
can't see- the length of their nose. If
she'd been all right in the upper story
she wouldn't a-had him after deserting
Myrelda. Lord knows, it's the great-
est providential blessing that could
a-been dropped down to her ; now she'll
get a man that's worth having, and rich
as cream into the bargain; for Myrelda
never would a-writ poetry if she hadn't
been pushed up to it by that trouble;
and her poetry's won her a husband
that every girl in town would give their
two eyes to get: He courted her three
years by letter they say, but the Doctor
like to a-put her light lout by his slan-
derous whispers, I am told. Well, it's
an interesting piece of business through-
out, and I want you to prepare to give
them a bridal entertainment after their
nuptials. It won't do to be at variance
with the wife of Herbert Hamilton.-
And, by the way, Charles is coming
home, right speedily; coming to the
wedding, I suspect; and I shouldn't
wonder if he's rich as John Jacob As-
tor, too, for one good luck always brings
company, and when it rains it pours."
Mabel had ceased her airy move-
ment, and stood looking through the
window. Her face flushed crimson at
this last piece of information, and grew
white as Parian marble; her slight
form trembled visibly as' she leaned
against the casement, but no one ob-
served her agitation. She stood there
till her nerves recuperated, then went
composedly back to the piano, so far as
externals were concerned. Sweet Ma-
bel ! There was a trembling secret
nestling away down in the nunnery of
that pure young heart that none but
Charles Montford had ever suspected.

humorously, but a shade was in his

' I wish the day was ended, and you

her arpi' ;around him, and Hamilton
felt herquiver.

sensibly, beneath the heart-thrilling
kiss he pressed upon her lips.
"Do you fear for me, Myrelda ?"
" Yes, Sir !"
" And why, darling ?"
" That man is destined to be my
cvil genius, through life, I .fear, tier-
bert !".
"' That man ?' Who" ?
"That monster; Gerald !"'
hailtoi gave a quick, irivoluatarfy
start, backward, and essayed to mislead
her as to the cause.
" It's going to rain, puss ; that toe
pinches like seven hundred !" ,
Myrelda smiled, unavoidably, at the
ludicrous contortions of his face.
" Why don't you apply the oil of
wormwood, Herbert ?" she asked, laugh-
ingly, "It's an infallible remedy, and
ought to be proclaimed to the four
quarters of the globe. I'll publish it
myself, as a charity to mankind.''
" I'll prove it, by George !" he mut-
tered, with well feigned symptoms of
annoyance.  "But tell me plainly, My-
relda, why do   you fear Gerald, as
consummate a coward as ever walked
the earth ?"
" A snake in the grass is more dan-
gerous than one we can see, and pre-
pare for. Havn't I cause for appre-
hension, Herbert ?" She laid her -lead
back upon -his shoulder, and looked up
into his eyes, with an expression that
puzzled him.
" Now what does that mean ? I'll
own I can't read the riddle written in
those eyes. There's a meaning in it
too abstruse for my powers. Speak
plainly, and tell me all you think."

" Then, plainly, sir. I think he would
do secretly what his violent passions
have inipelled him to attewnpt openly !"
Hamilton started again, and gave his
toe the credit.
" Openly ! what am I to understand
by that, pray ?"
"Now, don't affect ignorance, sir.-
I know all, Herbert !" She burst into
tears, and sobbed in heart-anguish up-
on his swelling bosom. Hamilton knew
how deeply he was loved, as he held
her quivering form closely to his breast;
and the thought unnerved him.
" How did you learn that, Myrelda?"
"4Through the servants, this morn-
ing, who were not aware of being over-,
heard."
He set his lips firmly together, and
his black eyes flashed fury; but sup-
pressing his indignation, he said with
assumed pleasantry :
" I'll take you away, soon, where the
black imps can't disturb your quiet. I
have sought to keep you in ignorance
of that absurd act, to avoid distressing
you, unnecessarily. I feared your weak
woman's heart"-he pinched her plump
chin, and curved his proud mouth, with
affected -disdain--"would be intimida-
ted and constantly troubled by that
knowledge. He is too dastardly to at-s
tempt it, whatever may be his fearn-
ings to that effect ; his cowardly fears
of being suspected, after all that has
transpired, particularly on that occasion,
will deter him, I don't fea1 him, Myrel-
" No, sir, you wouldn't fear to march
up, single handed, and face 'an army
with banners.' If there were an atom
of fear in, you, my life would not now
peril your own."  Tears filled her eyes
again, but she bit her lip and struggled
to crush them back.
" But the whole earth is bright andI
beautiful, even in its winter garments,

and life very der to me now, Myrelda;
and the probability of losing it and
you would doubtless make Mme fear and
tremble. I should not fear to die i I
knew I should carry you in ,my arms
over the death flood, and live with you
in eternity."
She looked up with an expression
that Herbert Hamilton saw in his lash
hour, as she uttered the words: "we
shall not long be separated, Herbert, if
you cross the Jordan first."
" Love for you has led me to hope
and trust for life hereafter; and if God,
gives you to my arms on earth, through
His grace I will hold, you there in
heaven."
She closed her moist eyes With a
bright smile, and Hamilton caught the
whisper " saved," as her small handy
met in a devotional clasp and were-laid
softly upon his arm.
He drew out his watch. "There, if I
tarry longer I shall lose my credit, and
bring reproach upon you ;" humorously.
She dropped her face upon hisibreast
and sat silent some time. He held her
there, without a word, till she raised
her head and untwined her arms from
his neck.
"There, that will shield me," he said
smilingly.
"11 hat, Herbert ?"
"That prayer. Itcreptright through
my vest pocket and told the whole
story to a little monitor on the other
side.' Like Jonah, I could go forty
days and nights in the strengthof it.
Now don't be distressed about me." He
looked at her earnestly and, inquiringly;
Myrelda swallowed down her anguished
emotions,and raised her eyes with asmile.
" And now, in return foryours, ,pray;
God bless you, my darling, and 'give His
angels charge over you, and him you
love."
He had gracefully slipped from the

sofa to a kneeling posture, and drawn
her gently beside him. He held her
thus some moments in silence, his face
bowed upon her head.-
Myrelda hastened up to her chamber
when. the door closed upon his majestic
form, and in its mournful hush, her
petit-up misery gushed forth, The black
cloud had culminated in the zenith of
her sky, and the wild storm broke furi-
ously over the green things in the gar-
den of her heart. Dr. Merton soon found
her in a state of high nervous excite-
tient, and left her in unconsciousness,
with Aunt Linder anxiously watching
her restless slumber.{
Herbert Hamilton was too brave to
carry deadly weapons, about his person,
in a civilized community; he had never
descended to that mean and cowardly
habit; and though target-shooting was
an early practice that had rendered him
perfect as a marksman, he had not pos-
sessed one since his sojourn in Virginia,
having presented his own, to a friend in
New   England, after his return from
abroad, which friend was preparing for a
journey to Oregon.
But Myrelda's presentiment, Gerald's
known villainy, and the loneliness of the
road over which he must pass, where a
murder and robbery had been committed
even since his residence in Arlingford,
decided him to appropriate the weapon
of Mr. Berrien, with whichhe had given
Smith the astounding proof of his pro-
ficiency, and which had since remained
in the office.
He artfully loaded and capped the
instrument, with the mental ejaculation:
"God ave me from the necessity of
shedding life blood," and mounting his
fiery charger, a powerful, prancing an-
imal, he put spurs to the snorting steed,
and dashed off towards Fairville.- As
Geraldhad said,the country was sparsely
populated, and on either side of the road,

in some portions, dense with underbrush
that defied the organs of sight to pene-
trate fifteen feet from the highway.
Hamilton had lingered so long with
Myrelda, that he found it necessary to
proceed as fast as possible, in order to
reach Fairville in time for the com-
mencement of the Court-session. He
had arrived at the loneliest, and darkest
spot upon his route, and as the bravest
man, under some circumstances, will
feel a little restlessness creeping over his
inner life, at the fancy of a pistol muzzle
taking deadly aim at his heart, through
the dark, Hamilton's black eyes swept,
piercingly along each side of the dense
way, and he urged his horse to a quicker
pace. There was no fear in his iron na-
ture; he could have marched up to the
cannon's mouth ijnshrinking, but My-
rilda's solicitude was in his mind, and a;
feeling of suspense, that ever renders
the anticipation of an event worse than
the reality, induced him to wish for more
open, and less suspicious quarters.
An explosion echoed beside him, as
his spurs touched the animal's side ; the
wild beast bolted, at the startling sound,
as the loud report of fire-arms-broke the
solitude far and wide. Hamilton drew,
the stout reins tightly in his powerful
hand, and snatching the pistol from his
breast, wheeled the frightened horse in
the direction of the fire, as a second
shot from the concealed foe woke the
deep woods from their slumber. The
frantic steed reared and plunged, and
bolting from the enemy, dashed madly
along the highway, in the direction of
Fairville, leaving the noble form of his
late rider upon the ground, and a third
shot quickened the clatter Qf his flying
feet !

Gerald turned on his heel, and strode
out into the street, with a gay whistle,,
leaving hjs simple wife: smiling satisfac-
tory, at the prediction which evinced
his contempt for her whilom rival. He
passed Mr. Berrien's, as Hamilton was
ascending the steps.. Gerald compressed
his lips, and gave his horse an irritable'
cut with his riding whip, that soon
carriedhimbeyond the corporation limit.
"It's his last visit I" he. muttered,
fiercely; "let him make the most of it!"
He galloped, on, and gained the deep

cautioly towards the, highway. He

caps. He had nerved himself for the,
blQody deed with a powerful dose of
French{brandy; and supplied himself
with a flask full of the courage-eleva-
ting beverage, to sustain him through

the ordeal; but despite th e stimulating
fluid, his nerves collapsed, as the sound
of hoofs came up the still, road to his
listening ear, and faster grew his heart-
beats as they neared him.
Gerald stationed himself behind .,a
sturdy tree-trunk, and peeped through
the brush-barrier, for the first glimpse
of his victim.  His nervous finger
brought the hammer upon, the first cap,
as Hamilton came in sight, and had it
discharged the barrel, he would have
been spared the effort of pulling twice;
but the quick bolt of the startled horse,
bore his rider in advance of tha first

ments of the restive animal, as Hamil-
ton wheeled him irresistibly towards
thehidden foe, saved him from the se-
cond whzzing bullet, as it whistled
over the frantic steed.
Gerald's hand dropped, from sheer
excitement, as he saw Hamilton fall,
satisfied of success; but his hair stood
on end with fright when he beheld him
bound up from the earth, apparently
unharmed, and plunge into the , under-
brush, in eveident search of his foe,

in apearanceL

Smith's assertion that he would slide

flashed- through the -cowardly  villian's
mind and dropping his weapon, uncop-
sciously, in his extreme fright, he dar-
ted from the old tree-trunk; and if. the
boughs above him had possessed  eyes,
they would have witnessed some. long
strides and tall steps from the flying
miscreant!
Hamilton saw the, shaking of thq
bushes through whichhe sped, and fir-
ing in that direction, followed hard in
lyis wake. The discharge gave no great-

er impetus to Hamilton's horse, than to
Gerald's heels; and he shot through the
woods like an arrow, in search of his
fleet-footed steed; but the animal had
disappeared I Perhaps he had been
alarmed by the firing, and escaped
homeward. In dispair, Gerald bolted
into an old hollow tree, and awaited in
trrpidation of soul, the coming up of
the enemy, pistol in hand, for a defen-
sive shot.  But no sound of pursuit
disturbed his guilty soul.
In his race, Hamilton's foot became
entangled in a wild vine, that would
have laid him at full length upon the
soil, had he not grasped a slender sap-
ling and saved his head from going-
like 'the spirit of the beast that per-
isheth"-"downward." He disengaged
himself from the creeping ligament, and
abandoned the pursuit, concluding it
would be fruitless, and-an unnecessary
waste of time.  He turned his steps
towards the highway, and chanced upon
Gerald's fallen weapon. Hamilton took
it up, and in utter astonishment, saw
his own initials upon the shining silver
plate. He had no doubt as to who was
his assailant-the fact of his flying
stamped him with-Gerald's known cow-
ardice-but the letters divulged a deep-
er plot than he had suspected. There
was doubtless a fellow to the oie he
held, and the engraver of the' initials
could probably identify their owner. He
would probe the matter to the bottom,
and visit upon the monster the whole
weight of the law.
He placed the weapon in his pocket,
and. turned towards Fairville in quest of
his horse, which, fortunately, had been
arrested by a pedestrian, who had
mounted and was galloping back in
search of the rider. Hamilton liberally
rewarded the humble woodsman for the
great service, and without alluding to
his recent encountre, hurried off to

Fairville. He had decided to keep the
affair secret from all but his associate,
to avoid alarming the foeand increasing
Myrelda's solicitude, till proof sufficient
could be obtained, to convict him of
the crime. Could he have looked a
little into the future, he would have
pursued a far different course.
On his return ro Arlingford, he was
greeted with fraternal feeling by Charles
Montford, who had arrived during his
adsence ; and in the presence of her
lover and brother, Myrelda forgot her
late misery, and laughed at her idle
fears, as Hamilton playfully plumped
her head back upon his shoulder, and
drew down his face in a die-away- ex-
pression,. in nimiery of her morning's
appearance.
Had she known that but for her pre-
sentiment, that noble and idolized form
would then have been rigid and cold in
its last long slumber, the wild rose would
not have bloomed sweetly upon her round
cheeks, nor the sparkles of pleasure
floated and flashed in those lustrous
brown eyes. Hamilton designed never
to acquaint her with the diy's adven-
ture, till his assailant was securely lodged
where his life could not agonize her heart
with fears for his own safety.
Their marriage had been delayed in
expectation of Charles' arrival; and
now an early day was specified for the
consummation. Hamilton intended to
startle all Arlingford, by the brilliancy
and pomp of Myrelda's bridal, celebrated
in her childhood's home, before, pro-
ceeding on a northward tour. Aunt
Linder and Rose were snugly domicili-
ated in their old quarters, which recon-
ciled them, somewhat, to her anticipated
absence of some months. Myrelda laid
her head on the pillow that night, with
a heart overflowing with gratitude and
love to Him who had broughther through

OR, THE BAS BLEU.            99


100                HERBETT HAMILTON;

the dark shadows, of adversity, into the
broad sunshine of earthly happiness.
. The day subsequent to the events nar-
rated, the city of Arlingford was agi-
tated by the announcement of Dr. Ger-
ald's mysterious .disappearance. Mrs.
Gerald had fallen into hysterics, as the
night wore on, and her husband came
not, and a scouting party, organized by
her brother, had gone in quest of the
missing man.
Hamilton experienced a strange sinka
ing of the soul, as this intelligence was
communicated at the Melville House,
that he could not shake off. He half
resolved to disclose the whole affair, and
exp;ess his belief that Gerald had ab-
sconded,.through fear of being appre-
hended and brought to justThe; but a
second thought decided him to await
Mr. 3errien's return, and obtain his
advice and co-operation. Gerald would
doubtless, be forthcoming with a plausi-
ble excuse for his delay, which would
serve to screen him from suspicion, if
the affair had been divulged. He re-
lied upon the weapon in his possession,
as the means of convicting his assailant.
He would search the world over, if ne-
cessary, to find the engraver of those
initials. He awaited anxiously, further
information concerning the matter, but
the day closed, and still the scouting
party had not returned.
A cheerful group was gathered in Mr.
Berrien's parlor that night, when the
noble-hearted proprietor entered and
grasped Charles Montford warmly by
the hand, with a hearty slap of con-
gratulation ,upon the shoulder. Charles
had been absent two years, and in.
listening to the recital of his adventures
in the far West, the night flew swiftly
and insensibly on. The iron tongue of
the'city clock had long droned out upon
the tranquil- night-waves the hour of'
eleven, when, in answer to a nervous

ring of the door bell, the stout Sheriff
entered, followed by officers.Burley and
Bragg, Gerald's brother-in-law  and
Smith, and arrested Herbert Hamilton
for the murder of Dr. Gerald I
Hamilton sprang to his feet in aston-
ishment and horror, while the late gay
and joyous group grew livid with ex-
itemenit.
Myrelda clung to her lover's arm in
mute agony, while her slender form
shook like a leaf in an autumn blast. -
Hamilton passed his arm around her
tiny waist, and holding her securely to
his breast, turned unflinchingly and
firm as granite to the emissaries of the
law.
.  Is Dr. Gerald dead ?"
Slie is, Sir," said the Sheriff, re-
spectfully, as he observed Hamilton's
loftly air. "His body, and that of his
horse, were found shot and partially
buried with these articles, apparently
lost in the confusion of the moment."
He produced a pistol-fellow to the one
in Hamilton's possession-and a hand-
kerchief bearing his name !
Myrelda recognized the latter as her
own gift, and turned her eyes, despair-
ingly, upon her lover's firm face. He
met her glance and asked half sternly:
" Do you think me guilty of this
crime, Myrelda ?"
She read his heart in his tone and
expression.
"I do not, Sir." He smiled at the
earnestness of her tone, as he turned
again to the Sheriff.
" I have too much respect for law to
seek to elude it; but before I leave this
house, allow me an explanation to those
I leave within it."
He related, in a calm, earnest tone,
the whole story of the assult, and the
why and wherefor of its concealment ;
and raising his eyes, reverently, to
heaven, he concl ded the revelation,-
with the words:

Lynch grew more sanguine and self-
satisfied, at this broad and emphatic
declaration, but carefully avoided Ham-
ilton's eyes.
Mr. Wilmot testified to the unim-
peachable .life of his foster son; and
the old man's nervous excitement, and
earnest solicitude would have stamped
him as the culprit to an ignorant ob-.
server.
TheState's Attorney'sopeningspeech
was followed by an energetic one from
Mr. Berrien, the counsel for defense.
He painted(Gerald's reputation in viv-
id colors, his desertion of an affianced
bride, from mercenary motives, his sub-
sequent slanderous insinuations con--
cerning her, to screen his own baseness,
his unjustifiable animosity for her ac-
knowleddlover, his wanton attempt
upon ihat, lover's-life, the challenge and
its declension,, had the prisoner yearn-
ed forthe life of his adversary, he
could have sent him into eternity with-
out trouble or stratagem, and been con-
sideredonorable, in the estimation of
the world! :Was it unreasonable or un-
natural to suppose that one so eager for
the destruction of the prisoner as the
deceased had evidenced himself to be,
would not descend to the assassin's re-
sort tocompass. his end, :when other
means!had failed ? If Gerald's design
was to obviate suspicion by murdering

the prisoner with weapons bearing his
own initials, would not so cunning a
mind fold himself in a mantle of secre-
ey, respecting all that pertained to so
nefarious a plan ? Was it marvellous
that he should not have bruited abroad
his absence, when that absence was
purposely designed to affect his scheme?
Gerald's personnel so strongly resem-
bled the prisoner's that a stranger might
readily confound their individualities,
under the circumstances. It was a well
known fact, that the deceased had ever
prided himself upon the feminine size
and seeming of his hand, witnesses had
testified to that truth."
Mr. Wiley, the opposing counsel,
succeeded Mr. Berrien.
"If the prisoner at the Bar were
guiltless of the crime alleged, who was
the murderer of the deceased ? Did
suspicion rest upon an ther enemy who
could devise so perfect a plot for the
prisoner's destruction ? The arraigned
had acknowledged the assault of the
deceased, upon the highway, and his
cowardly flight., Who would believe
that an ambushed enemy would fly,
without a third shot at a prostrate foe ?
and who would believe the prisoner at
the Bar so brave as to face a hidden
assailant, a broad target for a secret
weapon, when a frantic steed would
have carried him   swiftly, beyond its
deadly power? It were far more reas-
onable to believe that the loss of the
weapon and handkerchief, in the hurry
and confusion of secreting the. murder-
ed -body, originated the whole story
of the assault. Had the prisoner been
granted sufficient time to regain the'lost
articles, the deceased would doubtless
, have been borne from     his coffinles
- home in" the tangled wildwood, to th
silent grave-yard out yonder, witho-
this last black reflection upon his ia
mented clay, and an idolizing wife, no

getically, to the blazing prisoner, with a
faint smile that the spectators construed
into an evidence of feeling antagonistic
to his position; and closed his address
by reminding the jury ;that one who
would commit the crime for which the
prisoner was arraigned, would not scru-
ple to make any declaration, however
emphatic, respecting his innocence..
Hamilton's eyes turned to Myrelda,
with anxious solicitude, when the jury
retired. 'Her livid excited!face agonized
him, and he motioned to Charles to re-
move her; but Myrelda firmly refused
to obey her brother's .gentle command
and her lover's appealing look. Charles

essayed to nerve himself for the worst,
with Dr. Merton, at the lover's request

the jury slowly and solemnly, re-entered
the court-room.

"Have you found the prisoner guilty

The foreman drew a long, deep breath
ere he enunciated hoarsely:

"My noble husband."
Hamilton's face flushed, radiantly, at
the timid sound, and the -rare, sunshiny

Myrelda started spasmnodically, and
clung tightly-.to Hamilton, as the pale
and agitated sheriff entered to lead his
prisoner to the place of execution.-

anguish, and with a quiver and gasp
she lay upon-his breast in strong con-
vulsions.  He yielded her to the weep-
ing Charles, with   such  deep soul.
suffering depicted upon his livid face
and contracted brow, that the grim and
hardened sheriff joined in the concert
of sounds that filled the dreary prison.
" Charles, my brother, this is worse
than death!1"  Hamilton clasped them
both in his arms, as he spoke, and laid
his face upon Myrelda's.  -    .
"'Never leave her or consign her to
an asylum.' Her life will be short--we
shall soon meet again, my innocent,
suffering wife. Dr. Merton, I leave
her, a dying legacy, to your unceasing
care and professional skill.
He laid his arm over the tortured
Mr. Berrien's shoulder, with a fervent
" God bless you I" and went forth into
the free air of heaven; from which he
had been so long shut out, for another's
villainy. His step grew firmer as he
walked to the place of execution; and
ascending the elevation, he turned, in
proud majesty, to address the assembled
thousands before him.
Mr. Berrien dashed out of the prison

Dr. Elwood vaulted into the saddle,

the wrist of the deranged man, who from
time to time muttered incoherently, and

HERBE-RT HAMILTON;

A loud report and savage yell echoed'
behind the speaker, and Hamilton
turned, involuntarily, at thesound. It
was crazy Joe; he had landed, with one
tremendous bound, from among the
spectators, upon the platform; his great
blue eyes rolling in 'fine frenzy,' and
brown hand flourishing a most formi-
dable-looking knife.
"I'll stick it in the dratted Sherifff
clean up to the handle, ef he dares to
tech Hamilton-dog me !'' roared Joe,
flourishing the glittering knife around-
his headwith the look of' an escaped
lunatic.
The grieved Sheriff smiled sadly, at
this effervescence of affection from the
half-witted for the doomed man, while
tears sprang to the eyes of the prisoner
at the demonstration.
Officer Bragg crept stealthily behind
the furious youth, and  wresting the
knife from hisclutching fingers, pinioned
hin securely, and was bearing him from
the platform, kicking and yelling fran-
tically, when Hamilton stepped forward
and graspedhis hand with a last farewell.
" God bless you, Joseph, we shall
meet again; be her friend, when I am
gone."
Great tears were rolling from Joe's
eyes, as he found himself incapable of
aiding his friend, and he sobbed out
between a shriek and a groan:
"I will so!-oh Lord !--I will so! ef
I don't, dog me!"
Joe plunged and howled in his des-
perate efforts to escape from his captor;
and the memory of the dim and dreary
prison, with which he was threatened,
alone silenced his obstreperousness; but
he dropped down at the feet of the offi-
cer, and sobbed like a whipped child,
upon the bare ground.   -
Hamilton crushed down his emotion,
with a strong effort of his extraordinary
will, and proceeded with his address.

Suddenly the Sheriff's hand was laid
heavily upon his shoulder; while his
white face and starting eyes betrayed
the most intense excitement. Hamil-
ton's eyes followed his wild, eager gaze,
and far away, down the broad opening,
two horsemen were observed straining
over the smooth way with waiving hats,
and a shout was borne through the dis-
tance, to the acute senses of the eager
listeners.
Nearer and still nearer they flew,
Hamilton turned and looked at the
Sheriff, who had lifted the other hand
to his. shoulder and leaned nervously
upon his prisoner, forgetful of their re-
lative positions. Hamilton stood like a
marble statue, firm and cold to the last
degree, while the stout Sheriff trembled
with joyful anticipation.
The attention of the crowd was now
directed to the shouting and flying horse-
men, and Mr. Berrien was recognized,
hatless and bloody, in advance of Dr.
Elwood. Mr. Berrien had dropped his
hat, in mortal terror, as he ssaw from
afar the Sheriff's movements about his,
friend, and strained his lungs to arrest
attention, before the fttal deed was done.
He saw he was perceived, as he came
nearer, and lashing his foaming steed,
he gave a last and glorious yell, that
was caught up and prolonged by Dr.
Elwood: "hurra-a-a ! hurra-a-a-a !" and
shot forward. He tumbled headlong
from his horse, and leaped upon the
elevation.
"The murderer is found ! Hamilton is
free !''  The good man and faithful
friend fell exhausted and breathless
upon the platform, with his associate's
arms around him !
A shout went up from the immense
and excited crowd, that tore through the
air like live thunder !
The Sheriff burst into tears, and
hugged his late prisoner right heartily

-round the neck, as Dr. Elwood pro-
duced the watch, and made a short and
hurried revelation.  ilamilion stood
like one entranced, during the explana-
tion; he appeared rooted to the spot, ii-
capable of language or action.  Pres-
ently his fine form expanded gloriously,
the rich blood surged over his radiant
face, add his lustrous black eyes turned
smilingly heavenward.
"g4wife-thank God !" He tottered
forward, and leaned a moment upon Mr.
Berrier's shoulder; then leaping from
the plaifori with a mighty bound; he
fled towards his associate's residence,
with the uproarious rejoicings of the
immen e crowd following him, in peals
of thunder from iron-like lungs, that
tore up the blue atmosphere far and wide.
Joe reared-and plunged among the,
crowd, like one possessed as he compre-
hended the matter, and.his bran new
hat, presented by Hamilton, was seen
making an aerial tour, a little previous
to being "squat up" by the thousand of
trampling feet. He leaped upon the
back of officer Bragg, and hugging him
around the neck, well nigh to strangula-
tion, with unutterable joy, poor Joe
roared like a young lion !
The city clock rang out the hour of
twelve, as the late prisoner sprang up
the steps of Myrelda's temporary home;
Mr. Berrien's watch was ten minutes too
fast,
The servant uttered a scream of su-
perstitious fright, as she admitted him.
He caught her tightly by the arm.
" Silence !--don't fear; I am free-
how is Myrelda ?"
The girl quivered and sobbed :
" She ain't got over her fit yet ! Oh!
mars Ham'lton, dey say she won't live!"
Hamilton reeled and fell against the
wall.
" Go and send Dr. Merton here,
Fanny-quick !"

The negress fled up the stairs in a.
twinkling; she thought he was dying too!
Dr. Merton sprang.forward, and threw
his aged arms around Hamilton's neck,
as he hurriedly entered the parlor.
" Thank God !'for His mercy eudur-
eth forever.'" Hamilton's shoulder was
wet with his tears.
" Tell me there is hope!" The agonized
husband fixed his flashing eyes upon the
old man, while his fingers tightened
vice-like around his arm.
"While there is life there is hope;
if she can be made sensible of your es-
cape, she will live; but we must act with
.caution, a sudden revulsion might des-
troy her:"
Hamilton followed him up the stairs,
and softly entered his wife's chamber.
He caught Dr. Merton's arm, with an.
expression of utter despair upon his
countenance, as he beheld her face ; it
was rigid and cold, as though the last
spark had gone out. He gathered her
to his breast, with a tender fondness
that drew tears from all eyes. He had
thought never to hold that frail form to
his bosom again; and now that he was
free, to see her perish from his arms,
upon the very brink of earthly happi-
ness, and leave him alone in the world,
would be insupportable. He breathed
her name in softest accents, and kissed
her pale lips repeatedly; but her ear was
dead to the sound of his voice, and no
glad flush of recognition rippled over
her cold, white face.
The day wore tediously on, and Ham-
ilton sat beside her, no less white and
rigid than the face upon which his
strangely-lit eyes were riveted.  No
sound of sorrow or startled exclamation
had escaped his lips; yet those who
looked into the fathomless depths of
those restles, introverted eyes, knew the
deep throes of the strong heart beneath
them.

CHAPTER XXXIII.
Revenge, at first though sweet,
Bitter, ere long, back on itself recols.-4n1LToN.
Henry Greenwood was the only son
of a father who had obtained his wealth
by what is termed "foul means," that is
by imposing upon a dying relative, who
was non conmpos mentis; which wealth
was subsequently -wrested from his son,
by the - rightful heir, Mr. Edwards,
through the agency of Herbert Hamil-
ton's superior powers.
Mr. Greenwood, senior, was an un-
principled man, and trained up his son
to "follow in the footsteps of his illus-
trious predecessor;" and the race-ground
gambling saloon, and rumseller, were
well patronized by both father and son,
while the amiable and pious wife and
mother, wept over the downward ten-
dency of those most dear to her heart
on earth.
Mr. Greenwood, senior, died of mania
a potu, a few months previous to Ham-
ilton's advent in Arlingford, and the
result of the suit instituted by Mr. Ed-
wards, made the counsel a vindictive,
but secret enemy in the defeated and
abandoned son. This fact induced Mr.
Berrien to challenge him on the occa-
sion of Hamilton's trial; for though dis-
creet and courteous to the talented and
popular man, the lynx eye of Mr. Ber-
rien detected more in the countenance
of Greenwood, than his unsuspecting
associate had ever sought for.

Greenwood saw the look of surprise
that Hamilton gave Berrien, at the time
of his rejection, which rendered him
more sensitive during the trial, and
completely unmanned him, when, in
sweeping over the crowd, the prisoner's
eyes rested upon him. He hated Ham-
ilton, and yearned for revenge, but saw
-the better part of valor was discretion."
He soon perceived Gerald's animosity,
and watched him narrowly, hoping
through him, to satiate his thirst for
vengeance. He longed to form a league
with him against Hamilton, for the de-
struction of his hated rival's reputation
and by getting Gerald within his power,
supply his pecuniary wants from the
Dr's. purse, and at the same time, grat-
ify his yearning for revenge; but Gerald
was not to be entrapped into a conspiracy.
He concealed, as far as in him lay, his
bitter enmity for Hamilton-which was
an ineffectual effort of his fiery and
passionate nature-to obviate " suspicion
when his murderous plan was executed.
Greenwood was present at the Melville
House, the night of Hamilton's return
to Arlingford, and witnessed the Dr's.
humiliation; and was his victor at the
gambling saloon. He passed Gerald's
residence, as the intoxicated and furious
Dr. emerged therefrom, and surreptiti
ously followed in his wake. He saw
the firing of the building, and readily
comprehended the design; it was the
same that he yearned for--revenge !
Gerald's disguise did not availhim--
at last he had the blood-thirsty Doctor
within his power !  He awaited the
victim's return to the front yard, to dis-
close his knowledge of his felony, but
Gerald suddenly disappeared behind the
rear building, and made good his escape
ere Greenwood became fully satisfied of
the fact.
Henry Greenwood would not have
perpetrated cold blooded murder; but


OR, THE BAS BLEU.             121

120              HIERBERT HAMILTON;

he permitted the burning of the build-
ing, through hatred for Hamilton. Ils
hand had not ignited the match, and he
comforted himself with this reflection,
as he witnessed the after horror.  It
would be in vain to inform Gerald of his
knowledge now; he would deny the
charge, and there was no proof, and be-
sides to give publicity to the matter,
would but implicate himself, and open
up a gulf between him and his intended
victim.
Greenwood kept quiet, but followed
'Gerald more closely, and watched his
expression narrowly, in the presence of
Hamilton. He saw the flash of the Doc-
tor's eye, as his despised rival's visit to
Fairville, was announced, and formed his
plan accordingly.,- He felt confident,
that the murder of the lover was the
villain's aim, since his' attempt upon
Myrelda's life was defeated.
Gerald passed him, in the.disguise of
a decrepit old man, mounted upon a
mule, as he preceded Hamilton upon the
road to Fairville. Like Peter, Green-
wood ,followed him "a long way off," and
saw him enter the woods, unperceived
by him. He cautiously secured his vie-
-       .4im's horse, to prevent his escape, and
clambering up a lofty monarch of the
woods, awaited the result. He presented
himself to the terrified Gerald, as he
came forth from his hiding place, and
made proposals which the guilty man,
inhis awful strait acceeded to,  The
sum of-one thousand dollars was to be
the "hush money". for the present, with
future disbursements at Greegwood's
command.
Gerald suddenly became- very com-
municative, and confidential. He con-
fessed his incendiarism, and displayed
the: weapon as a proof of his satisfaction
and confidence in his new ally; but as
Greenwood's eyes were bent upon the
initials, a dagger flashed from the Doc-

tor's breast, and struck against a half
dollar in his vest, with a forcethat sent
him reeling backwards. He dodged
the second blow and aiming the weapon
he held, fired. Thus, the weapon bear-
ing his rival's initials, and which was
designed for his destruction, sent the
would-be-assassin, in the morning of his
years, into the presence of an offended
God; verifying the proverb: "who so
rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him."
Greenwood was confounded, as he
saw himself a murderer, but the Arch
Enemy whispered, he might now have
his revenge. He shot the Doctor's horse
and partially buried the two bodies, and
tossed the weapon in :the tangled wild;
he was not aware that it had a fellow.
He readily joined the scouting party,
and was the discoverer of the lost pistol.
The handkerchief was subsequently
found by Gerald's brother-in-law, 'it
having been lost during Hamilton's race
after his secret foe, and not perceived
until his arrival at Fairville; and as he
returned to Arlingford with Mr. Day..
ton, he could not tarry to recover it,
without betraying the secret which he
designed to preserve for a time, from
all but his associate.
Upon the commitment of 'Hamilton,
arid his final sentence, Greenwood's hate
was superseded by remorse, which de-
ranged his mind, as the day of execu-
tion drew nearer, and forced him, at
last, to a confession,
A few days subsequent to his entire
restoration to reason, Greenwood was
visited by Hamilton and his blooming
bride. The guilty man buried his pale
face in the pillow, in deep humiliation,
at his approach; but the kind voice of
the noble man whom he had "hated
without a cause," restored him to self-
possession; and laying his sickly, wasted
hand in his, with a sudden impulse. he
exclaimed, with a gush of penitential
tears:

"Forgive me, Mr. Hamilton !"
Herbert Hamilton did forgive, as his
subsequent care and kindness to the re-
formed man, and his estimable mother
evidenced.
CHAPTER XXXIV.
"Love is the fulling of the law, God is Love."
Fourteen months had passed, since
the events narrated in the last chapter,
and Myreldra Hamilton sat in an elegant
NewEngland home, twisting the short
jetty curls of a black-eyed baby boy
around her small, taper finger, when her
husband entered the apartment, bearing
a sealed letter.
The old flush of love and gladness
rippled up to her round cheeks, before
the smiling glance of Herbert Hamil-
ton, as she went forward, with assumed
stateliness, and bowed dignifiedly to the-
majestic form before her, whose deep,
dark eyes flashed with humor, while his
firm, manly face was scrupulously sober.
" My. dear Sir, I am most happy to
find myself again in your immediate
presence, after an everlasting age of ten
minutes' absence, and respectfully re-
quest that you will forthwith 'render
unto Cesar, the thing that is Caesar's.""
She peeped archly around at the letter
behind him.
Hamilton brought his hands behind
her, with a laughing squeeze, and
smack of her red upturned mouth, like
the report of a Christmas cracker, and
gently snubbled her nose with the edge
of the letter, ere he exchanged it for
his crowing baby, whose light drapery
fluttered musically in the breeze, as it
came down from an upward toss, with a
chirruping catch of the breath, and
grabbed at its father's black rings of
hair, with its tiny, fat- hand, which
elicited a facetiously frowning : "hello !

o-u-e-h !" from its delighted paternal re-
lative.
Myrelda read Charles' letter aloud,
which occasioned.no little surprise and
pleasure, in the heart of both husband
and wife. It ran :
"'The melancholy days have come,
The saddest of the year,'
to quote the language of that sweet but
mistaken poet, Bryant.
" The September winds go by with a
lullaby sound, which to a sorrowful heart
might seem a moan of anguish; and the
faint-hued blossoms are shutting up their
blue eyes in a peaceful death-slumber,
down by the garden wall, and off in the
woodland nooks ; the gold and crimson
leaves are rustling along the hazy ways,
and over the smoky rills, with low and
pensive sound, telling a tale of change
and.decay; but within my heart, sweet
sis, blooms a world of freshest verdure
just bursting into beauty and fragrance,
for the bridal day of your brother is
near at hand, and you and yours are
'respectfully invited to attend' the 17th
inst.
" When I left you so abruptly, in
your lovely summer home, four weeks
ago, I did not tell you that love for her,
who is now my betrothed bride, drew
me irresistibly to a warmer atmosphere
than floated-within your mountain clime.
" Three years agone, I resolved never
to reveal my heart to you, until I had
the assurance of a reciprocity of feel-
ing from her whom I have loved from
boyhood-my gentle blue-eyed Mabel
Clyde. But for our fallen fortunes, I
should have addressed her sooner; but I
feared her proud father, and trusted to
time and the symptoms of affection I
detected in her to realize my hopes.
.We are now betrothed, with the full
sanction of that proud father, who con-
fesses he would never have suffered
pecuniary circumstances, alone, fb im-


122           HERBERT HAMILTON;

pose a barrier to his child's happiness.
There is something noble in him,-away
down beneath the cold surface of high
station and pecuniary power, and my
Mabel looks hopefully to the time when
the little leaven in his proud nature,
will 'leaven the whole lump.' Mr. Clyde
esteems it an honor to bestow his
daughter upon the brother-in-law of
Herbert Hnmilton.
" Last week, Lora eloped with that
dissolute youth, Lorenzo Lee, to whom
her father objected, on the ground of
his principles, despite his wealth. Her
unfilial conduct has cast a gloom be-
neath the parental roof, and Mr. Clyde
turns more thoughtfully and humbly, to
his christian child, iny pure-hearted,
meek Mabel, for comfort and companion-
ship.
" Mrs. herald, it is rumored, will ere
long become the wife of Augustus Smith
through the magnetism of her many
golden charms. Imtaet her at Cape May
on my return South-a gay and dash-
ing widow, blooming in the brightness
of art, and surrounded by a bevy of
butterflies of fashion, who bask in the
rays of fortune, and court alone its
favorites, the most conspicuous of whom
was her bridegroom elect. I venture to
predict \for her a happier future than
her wedded past, even with, such a man
as Augustus Smith ! I would not say
more of the dead.
" Henry Greenwood continues tem-
perate and industrious, and gladdens
the heart of his amiable and pious
.mother by his steady and onward course.
In him is verified the scriptural passage:
'through fear, men depart from iniquity.'
He is now my head clerk, and gives
high promise of a prosperous and hon-
orable future. He reveres the name of
him whom he once hated and most
wronged-the forgiving and munificent
Herbert Hamilton.

"The improvements at the Vale are
now perfected, and the new and hand-
some mansion will be illuminated (deo
vo lente) the 18th, for the reception of
my loved and loving bride. We re-
pudiate the modern style of absconding
from church, on a bridal tour, and mean
to make our marriage a blessing to the
lovers of dainties and amusements, as
well as ourselves-especially 'the poor,
the maimed, the halt and the b lind'-
by keeping up the festivities for a season.
"I'm tired of bachelor life, in this
great old mansion, with none but Aunt
Linder and Rose,iand the cat that Her-
bert proposed to 'kick down stairs quick-
er than lightning, for presuming to kiss
the cheek that belonged to hirn,' for
company ; and I beg you will hasten
like summer birds, from the keen moun-
tain air of that New England home, to
a warmer and sunnier clime."
Myrelda laid her head back on Ham-
ilton's shoulder, and laughed merrily
over the quotation in Charles' letter,
while his large black eyes sparkled down
in her rosy upturned face, and the baby
squirmed and crowed at the inspiring
scene.
Charles had relieved the widow Ger-
ald of her husband's malicious purchase
and fitted it up for the future home of
sweet Mabel Clyde, who entered it soon
after Myrelda's return to Arlingford, as
Mrs. Charles Montford.
Mr. Berrien prosecuted Bushman and
Lynch for perjury-recovered the five
thousand dollars paid by Hamilton for
being condemned to die by their testi-
mony ; and the old judge who presided
at Hamilton's trial sentenced them to
five year's imprisonment in the peni-
tentiary, as a warning to others of like
ilk.
