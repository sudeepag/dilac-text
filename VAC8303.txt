"BLESS me, how provokingl" ejaculated im- patient Lucy Greenwood, her blue eyes peer- ing anxiously away in the dim distance. "Patience, lady fair; see, the long desired rounds the point off yonder--five minutes more, and this suspense will be ended," replied her gallant, hand- some Ernest Elwood. A pleased smile lighted up the little girl's spark- ling eyes, and her silk skirt became inflated through the rapidity of her shuffling little feet that did infinite credit to .the instructions of some "Master of Ceremonies." "The ' Percival,' as I live!" exclaimed Edith Elwood, another of the waiting group, ad the steam- er neared the wharf, and sent up a volume of black smoke from its iron lungs, accompanied by a shrill scream that would have curdled the blood of a unsophisticated hearer.

"The most provoking girl that ever the sun shone on t" grumbled Ernest, handing in Lucy, and dragging himself up the steps with a corrugated brow, and affected sulkiness. "You know, brother, I never patronize that boat," said Edith, significantly. ; ,',I-y I presume, to ask the cause of your aver- sion?" inquire Charles.

Charles reddened, and glanced furtively towards Lucy. e , ,    OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     7 "What a temperance man you are likely to be- come, with such an exemplar," said Lucy to Ernest. "Yes ; I never 'look upon the wine when it is red,' but my ears suffer for the indulgence," respond- ed the young man with an appearance of pain upon his handsome face, as though- his auricles were then enduring compression! I heard; I saw it all, as I drew my sable furs around my insignificant shoulders, and leaned back in an obscure corner of the waiting 'Buss.' - I was the poor cousin of the queenly Edith, and con- sequently she was my escort upon the present occa- -sion, and in fact upon almost every occasion that drew me into the  gay world- with my beautiful and wealthy relative. - She zuas beautiful, so far as large, liquid, heaven- ly blue eyes,- cream and roseleaf Cheeks, luscious- cherry lips and elaborate ringlets of purple'black- ness could constitute beauty. I loved, to sit and gaze upon her faultless face, unobserved, and half sighed as I beheld my own features reflected in the mammoth mirrors, in perfect contfest to those of my brillianthelle cousin's. I longed for one ninetiethl part of the love that was lavished upon her, and- secretly bemoaned Nature's niggardness in fashion- ing-my dark, diminutive face. But I' was not really unhappy. My cousin was warm-hearted-and kind, though capricious and woqiettish; and: by constant services rendered, for her amusement and benefit, I. lwas not wholly comfortless, though my / dependent position galled my proud spirit.     8  -   THE STRANGER'S STRATAGEM  I had never known a mothers love ; she died in giving me birth, and i father's last blessing was breathed upon my head ere I could realize the ex- tent of my irreparable loss. Theirs was an ill-starred union- in opposition to the wil of my maternal grandfather, from pecuniary considerations-and my proud relative could never quite forgive. me for bearing the name and carry- ing in my slender arteries the plebeian blood of my "poor preacher" parent. . For my own part, I gloried in my blood and cog- o nomen, but secretly, for fear of a reprimand and stern command to abdicate my comfortable :quarters close beside my uncle's 'old arm chair.' I loved him. He was the only white being in the wide world that I did love, then. My aunt was not positively 4hrsh and unfeeling, but she evidently regarded me as an interloper. I had none of her blood in my veins, but my uncle's was mingled with the " poor preacher's" there, and I loved him for my dead mother's sake, with all the ardor -that a- little lone child can Cherish for an only object. He was kind, but undemonstrative-distributed his gifts equally between:his two children and my- self -and no one -had ever detected a symptom of partiality or distinction exhibited towards the three juvenile creatures of his care. He was an indolent, indulgent, but ambitious man, who contented him- self with simply defraying the expenses of his children's education, and handing them over un- reservedly, to his wife and their instructors. Ho   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.      9 never sympathized with their infant sorrows-they never made him the custodiai of their childish se- crets-never. scrambled upon his knee, tied thefiT little soft arms in a. hard knot around his neck, and reddened their young cheeks against his rough face with an outhreak of boisterous mirth, but iushed their laughter at the first sound of his stately step, and crept silently away from his stern presence; and so a barrier of reserve, akin to fear, arose be- tween the hearts of father and child, as they advanced to mature years. My cousins were both the counterpart of -their mother, in mind and in person, and my aunt's whole : life was centered in her beautiful offspring. She was not devotedly attached to her husband, and I secretly thought she essayed to estrange her children from him, that their entire hearts might be bestow- ed upon her I She was jealous as a turbaned Turk, and this canker of the mind was manifested even with reference to her children's love? Me she evidently regarded as an object of charity, and her quiet patronising care and favors made me continually feel my humiliating. position. I could not have defined the distinction she formed between me and my cousins; the difference was not obvious to one uninterested; I could only feel, in my soul, that a line of demarkation did exist. I knew I was not loved, though I shared, apparently, her care and solicitude for my cousin Edith. Her white hands tucked the coverlet under-- my tiny shoulders, - and her red lips kissed me good-night, during her/i 1I* '                .  *, -.^    10    THE STRANGERBS STRATAGEM; habitual visits to our chamber; "to see that we were warm, and snugly laid,"' yet I knew it was performed only as an act of charity,; there was no genuine affection in her heart for the little isolated orphan child of a " poorpreacher," related to her by no tie of - consanguinity. My cousin Ernest was a bright, bold and beautiful boy, good hearted but wayward as his sister, who snubbed ipe in his moments of ill-nature, and play- fully pelted me with candies and nuts, when his fits of passion had subsided, to compensate for his past indignity. He treated me as an amusing playthilg, because of my doll-like size-would shonlder me in hisfrolicsome moods, for a gallop around the wide green garden, and be not over scrupulous of setting me down as softly as would better have suited my physical comfort. Many an estra bump hias been raised upon my little capital by being dumped down against the statue of Venus or Washiington, during these compulsory airings, that would have defied the wisdom of the best phrenologist, had lhe not been initiated into the secret of its origin. w My aunt laughed at the wild pranks of her petted 'boy, and gravelysilenced my sobs by coolly inform- ing me ( it was only in play.' As I grew older, I learned to:sympathiz6 with the poor frogs referred to in my school-book, who assured the naughty boy that pelted them- with stones for his amusement, i;thft:' though it was sport to him, it was death to -t:/tfim.' rI:knew I was not loved, and my young heart stood: aloof from its kindred, and shut itself up in   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     1  my lonely breast, darkening and growing more taciturn as the years of my childhood rolled away. I had but one friend at these times of peril and playful persecution,-an old- grey-haired servant of my maternal grandsire, whose long and faithful services had been rewarded by emancipation, in the last will and testament of his aged master. Uncle Will, who had been consigned to the care and support of my mother's brother, during his life, occupied a small shed upon' the premises, and thither I repaired upon every occasion that requir- ed comfort and condolence. Uncle Will was "a-, friend in need," and consequently " a friend indeed." The affection he had cherished for my mother was transferred to her child, althougll he'sorrowfuilly in- :formed me I wasn't :' one mite- like 'ergl " and that I " 'sembled my farder jest as much as .two peas." Uncle Will had-professed conversion under my father's ministry, and revered his memory as much  as he loved my lost mother for her beauty and gentleness of soul. I knew she was beautiful; the only ornament I  possessed in the world convinced me of that fact. It was a little gold locket, attached to a delicate chain of the most exquisite-workmanship, that was clasped by a heart and hand -tat bore my'mother's initials, and my own, "al . H.," and contained the miniatures of my unfortunate parents;{ and- I gloated over the tiny treasure as a miser over his hoarded' thousands.

"Why was I not born beautiful?"I asked m self, .and uncle Will, in -my moments of childish anguish--" then I should have been loved, like my mother and cousin Edith-!" ' . De Lord b'ess- yer soul, honrey I " exclaimed the old man, as he snugged me closerto Lhis patched homespun-vest, and kindly patted my little crown- "youn ain't ugly, chile, da's a fac', an' I loves ye a !heqp more better dan Miss Edy--I dus, Miss Bell.

I could,ot have swallowed a rare delicacy without a choking-sensation, had I not reserved a portion for uncle Will's appreciative palate; and sedulously lie returned the compliment. -There was always something in his pine cupboard to contribuite to the-gratification of my organ of alimentiveness, and more in his kind,; garrulous tongue, to relieve my mental craving. His humble shed was emphatically " my refuge in times of trouble," and " in the days of my distress I called upon him, and he heard me.? If "perfect love casteth out all, fear," I loved uncle Will perfectly, and I knew he was the only one upon the whole earth by whom I was truly lbved. And so the years rolled round, and wheeled me slowly up'to womanhobd. I was not really unhap- py, but. retiring and uncommunicative. There was no confidenee between me- and my relatives ; they   /14    THE STRANGER S STRATAGEM; quietly provided for my necessities, only requiring me fo render myself useful to the extent of my abil- ity, and there our intercourse ended. I was graciously permitted to attend school with my cousin Edith, and I labored early and late to improve the advantages vouchsafed me. I possessed a thinking; calculating mind.- My isolated child- hood had thrown me upon my inner life for amuse- ment and companionship; I spent all the day and half the night listening to an invisible something away in the memory of-my immaterial being, singing sweet wild fancies, that were perpetuated in after years. I had a secret motive in such unremitting labor. When fully competent, I designed to' leave my splendid, but icy home, and render my mental accomplishments subservient to my longing for free- dom and independlence. We had attained our seventeenth year, and were upon the eve of departing for a distant Seminary, for an absence of twelve months-the finishing of our scholastic course. Edith was four months my senior, and three years the junior of her brother Ernest, who would receive his diploma in one more year, at Randolph Macon College. "Mabel shall share equally with my daughter, in educational advantages. She is my only sister's child, and shall have the benefit of my patrimony, so far as mental culture. Let that end the discussion." Reader, I had stopped inadvertently at their cham- ber door, as I caught my name uttered by-my uncle,   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     15 in an unusually firm and high tone. I could not have moved an inch, in some seconds, had the ghost of Samuel, or any other "spook," risen up before me. I was rooted to the spot. My heart almost stopped its pulsations a moment; the next it beat one hun- dred to a minute, and a blindness camne over my eyes as I stumbled into my own chamber, and dropped down upon the hearth-rug. I was exceedingly sensitive, and of a most nerv- ous temperament. I trembled from head to foot, and my hands grew cold as the marble statues in uncle's garden, as I sat there and tried to calm my excited nature. It was the first insight I had ever had into my aunt's character. I had always known she did not love me, but I did not know or suspect that her in- difference amounted to such entire heartlessness- that shegrudged me the little from her heavy coffers, that my uncle expended for my education. I half resolved to decline accompanying mvy cousin Edith, and enter at once upon the course that I had mentally marked out for my future; 3 could com- plete my education, with the fruit of my own exer- tions, and thus relieve my penurious aunt of an in- tolerable burden. I could not compose my shattered nerves until I had confided this new-found, overwhelming trouble, to my sympathizing sable friend; and noir; as upon all previous occasions of distress, I posted off to un- cle Will. The old man doubled up his big fist, and brought it down upon his coarse striped trowsers.   16    THE STRAENGEARS STRATAGEM  leg with an indignant thump.' "Consarn 'er!" he growled "'taint nun uv her bisness now how, nuther! Marster had much prop'ty as she did, I nose-da's a fac', chile.

In his warm sympathy and solicitude, the old negro patted my cranium caressingly, as in the days of my childhood, as lie leaned upon his hickory staff, and looked down upon my sad -face, with his age- dimmed and mournfully compassionate eyes. I took- uncle Will's advice, and kept the secret of my aunt's cupidity and heartlessness from all others.   Y  CHAPTER II. Is it the sound of days that are no more?--Ossia. I WONDERED what he was thinking about, with those great blue eyes, so like my angel mother's riveted upon the red coals in the glowing grate. All was silent in that luxurious apartment. The costly and glittering decorations seemed to mock the melancholy stillness and gloom that hung over the three occupants. My aunt sat in the opposite corner, poring over the "Mysteries of Paris," and Edith's chair was ten- antless; the beautiful heiress was surrounded by her admirers in the drawing-room. t watched him surreptitiously, as I sat close by his side, till unconsciously my French exercise gra- vitated slowly to my lap, and-my own thoughts ran wild through the ruddy fire-flame that flickered over the anthracite. There was thick shade upon that full, massive brow, and deep sadness in those introverted azure eyes. I- wondered if he were not living over again his boyhood time, dreaming of the sweet eves " long, long ago," when three, who now lay in the silent grave, clustered around that old homestead-hearth, tlnd life was all sunshine and promise before him. (3) '  f- ,    18    THE STRANGER S STRATAGEMi; The stillness was deep and profound around me; I, even heard the tick of his repeater, as I sketched great pictures of by-gone days, among the ruby coals, and fancied faces in the flickering fire-light. There were large portraits in the drawing-room of my grand-parents and uncles, painted by the cel- ebrated American artist, George Healy; my own mother's had once hung there, but was removed and consigned to the flames by a vindictive father, after her marriage with a "poor preacher." I saw the stern, cold face of my unrelenting grandsire, looking through a grave-like mound in the glowing grate, as I mused on and on. It looked gloomy and remorse- , ful, and a seeming of acute pain furrowed the white, aged brow. The hallucination was so vivid arid distinct, that my heart beat faster as I gazed. I wondered if he saw it, too, and what effect did it produce. I leaned softly, very quietly back, in order to observe his face without attracting attention, and turned my face very slowly and cautiously towards him. I had expected to see those blue eyes riveted upon the red coals, in wonder and half fear, and that manly face white with emotion. My superstitious mind had invested him, for the moment, with like weakness and-perceptions. I met: those blue eyes full, as I slyly lifted mine towards them; they were very sad, still, but a soft. ness, a soul-kindness, beamed out of them into mine, that shot down to my heart, and effectually unhing ed mnimental mechanism. a    OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     19 He smiled benignantly as he witnessed my star- tfled and nervous expression, and laid his hand affect' ionately upon my head, as he had never before ca- ressed me.                $ "A penny for your thoulghts, Bell; I've been studying your face for at least ten minutes, and have seen it vary as many times, T'll declare! What did you see in the coals yonder, that made your black eyes well nigh pop out of your round head? I look: ed, myself, expected to see a grim ghost, or a 'ghdul' that lives 'up in the steeple,' as Poe tells us. You're sorry, too, not a little bit, but a ' big heap', as the little darkies say--I see it all about your tiny mouth, that looks like a piece offlint, by Jupiter!-What's the matter, Bell?-hate to go away and leave uncle, eh?" I lost sight of my aunt and every thing extrane- ous, as I heard that dear kind voice, and felt thati father-like hand laid tenderly upon my orphan head, and acted solely from impulse. I sprang upon his knee, clasped my arms around his neck and kissed- him many times in quick succession, with more pas.- sion than I had ever displayed in my life before.- He was evidently surprised, though he -put his arms around me and drew me closely up to his broad-. breast, as he pressed his lips warmly and lingeringly to mine. I laid my face upon his shoulder and: cried like a child, for very gladness. I felt like a- wanderer of many long years, who had just- eomi- back from stranger lands, and nestled down, securely. and peacefully, in his own loved home. f ;:i.   20    THE STRANGE1'S STRATAGEM ; He put back the brown hair from my wet eyes, and urged me to tell him the cause of my distress. I swallowed down a mighty sob, and raised my head. "I was sad because I was all alone in the world. I have no father and mother to care for me. I am poor, and dependent upon you for my education, but I will teach and -support myself, when I am qualified. I am poor and plain, and nobody loves me, I thought, and I had rather not live than not be loved by you, uncle. I know you have fed and clothed me seven- teen years, but my heart has been freezing and starv- ing. Nobody ever said they loved me, but uncle Will.! Don't you love me, uncle?" I could scarcely breathe, he held me so tightly. A strange pallor had settled around his closely compressed lips, and two large tears had melted into a clear stream along the lower lids, that only needed a slight motion of those lids to shake them over the black lashes upon the white cheeks be- neath.  HeI dropped his face upon mine and those tears wet my forehead. I cried more heartily than ever. "I love you, Bell, my darling, as my own child, and as such I regard you. Half of your mother's wealth was bequeathed to me, and you have a right to what you have received. You shall never teach, while I live, so put that out of your head, notw. Good Lord I what a soul you have, and I thought you were as cold and hard as granite, and cared no more for your uncle than the man in the moon!"   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     21 He turned upon my aunt a glance the signifi- cance of which I could not then comprehend. The motion reminded me of her presence, and I shrunk instinctively as I met her eyes. They were  calm, but very cold-cold as ice, in their expression, and her face was white as my uncle's. I trembled and my arms tightened involuntarily around his neck, as I looked. He gave me a glance, at the act, and I saw that my inner life was no longer veiled from his awakened perceptions. My aunt laid aside her book, and spoke very soft- Aly and composedly, while her eyes glittered with jealous rage. "Nature must have designed you for the stage, -1iss Hastings, you act so well and so naturally. You assume that no one loves you, when from your infancy I  have performed, by you, the part of a mother. Your ingratitude is unparalleled. Have I not cared for you, even as my   own daughter? What charges can you prefer against me for neglect and unkindness?" "I make none, aunt, and I am not certainly un- grateful." "Then why this fine acting, and these sly insinu- ations? You say no one loves you, when all the care you have received during your past life, proves the assertion a  falsehood. What secret design does this theatrical scene cover?" Her fierce eye and) sarcastic tone stirred up all my inherent pride. I  lifted any head from his shoulder, and turned my eyes full upon hers; I ,   22    TsB STnANGER'S STRATAGEM; neither trembled nor winced. I was thoroughly aroused.    - "I am acting only from impulse. I was betrayed into: this weakness by unexpected kindness. I al- ways loved: my uncle for my mother's sake as:well as his own, but I never dared to tell him so, till low, because t was afraid-'awed -into silence and reserve- by his apparent coldness and indifference. Bee never drew me to him by words of kindness, antil to-nightf He never kissed me since I can re- member, until this hour, though I have him many a time when he was sleeping, and I was not afraid. I--" (he caught me quickly to his breast, and stop- peda my mouth some, seconds, with his own,) " I have tried to wigi- your love, aunt. I know you have cared for my physical wants and comfort, but I never felt that you loved me. I knew you were only giving in chllarity what you bestowed upon me. I have laid my arms, many a time, around your neck, hoping to have the yearnings of my orphan heart satisfied by one symptom of affection, but you put them gently but carelessly away. Love, aunt, speaks to the heart, without words or deeds, while the want of it will be felt even though actions would indicate its existence. My soultold me I was not loved, and I felt all alone in the world; buit.I am neither sad nor lonely, now." " You possess the faculty of speech in an eminent degee, Miss Hastings, and after your past dullness and taciturnity, I am surprised to find your volu- i ,-'bility equal to your impudence. Go to your room,  OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     23 if you please, and have done with this stage scene --it is sickening." I was quietly rising to go to and essay to conciliate her, when my uncle drew me firmly back, and held ;: me securely in his folded arms, as he said, calmly but decisively  "I wish to talk with'lMabel; you can retire if the scene is offensive." She went quickly, with a storm of passion fulmi- hating in her cold glittingng eves. My heart grew. heavy within me, for I saw I had provoked an im- placable enemy;  We satthere a long time, and I learned more of my uncle's kind- .and loving nature than I had de- tested in seveenteen years. He told me about my mother-of their early affection, and her unfortu- nate marriage that separated her from her proud relatives, and cautioned me against forming so im- prudent an attachment. My heart sank like lead at this well meant advice, for, reader, I had, long ago, formed a strange attachment, and was then the betrothed wife of one whom I had never met, and of whose circumstances and social position I was utterly ignorant!  I struggled to. tell him all-to make g frank and full confession of what I had so long and carefully concealed from even my confidant, uncle Will, but my spirit failed me. I feared .the frown and stern rebuke, now that I new his feelings for, and inten- tions oncerning me . My grandfather had bequeathed my mother's yf   24 ;  THE STRANGER'S STRATAGEMo portion of his possessions to his two sons-Edward and Ernest-the latter of whom had been for many long years a resident of India. I had never seen him--and my uncle Edward designed to bestow my mother's portion of his property upon her orphan child. Conscience stung me, like a serpent's tooth, for my duplicity as I listened; but dread of losing the love I had so lately found, held me in bands of iron. I resolved to trust to time for strength to make the revelation, and defer the evil day as long as possible. My betrothed was then in Europe, and, would not, return until- my school-days were ended, when he would appear to claim the. hand I had pledged him under such wildly romantic cir- cumstances.  .     .    CHAPTER III. ALONE in my chamber, after the first "good- night" kiss I had ever received from my moth- er's brother, I took from my travelling trunk, ready packed for to-morrow's journey, the daguerreotype of one whom I had never met, but in whose last letter Lhad read the words, italicised, with two ex- clamation points following, "Mabel, my wife!/" as applied to me! How my heart bounded and my hand shook as I read those words, and how cold I grew after it I Would he love me when we met? I asked myself. No one loved me that knew me personally, but poor ignorant uncle Will; would not he change when his ideal stood before him in propria persona? I grew cold with dread, for iso- lated as I was from all the world, with a heart yearning for affection, I had been easily impressed by his words of admiration and love, and a view of his noble, manly nature, as displayed through *the medium of two years' correspondence. But how was this affected? Sydney Sutherland was hundreds of miles away, and I was an-obscure, plain and penniless orphan of a "poor preacher." Reader, I was a Poet, unknown to all the world 2      -(26)   26    THE STRANGER'S STRATAGEM ; but him, to whom my effusions were transmitted. The loneliness of my heart found relief in poetry; and waifs of Passion, Love, and Despair, went out overthe land, from the deep solitude and gloom of my spirit life. My writings were extensively cop- ied, and I soon found myself growing famous behind the shelter of a friendly'4i4om lek plume, without daring to enjoy publicly the benefit of such uii- looked-for celebrity. I had the satisfaction of hearing myself eulogized, and, abused, according to the antipodal tastes of individuals, without being -for a moment suspected ask the author of so -much discussion and curios- ity-  :  My cousin Ernest was one of my most ardent admirers, and posted a letter of inquiry to tile editor of the journal to which I contributed, con- cerning me. I was aware of his design, and foiled him in his effort. Ernest anathematized the editor for declining to make the disclosure. How he would have stood aghast, had he known the author of his indignant outhurst was his little insignificant "poor cousin!   .\  My. cousin Edith curled her luscious crimson lip, that :a honey-bee would have lit upon, in a flower- bed, for a rosebud, through mistake!-with the slightest- bit of scorn, as she heard my praise: she had her mother's nature, and was jealous, even of a - stranger!  I grew less sad than formerly--I had found a new world, new" hopes, new aspirations. I wrote on i ,v   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     27 and on, and guarded the secret even from uncle Will.  Six months from my dAbut in-the literary arena, I received a communication from Sydney Suther- land, enclosed and directed by my editor. tHe had resorted to this method, in order to effect an epis- tolary acquaintance.' I had long known him as a writer of high merit and considerable renown in the literary world. My pride was gratified by this event, but prudence held me in long deliberation. Would it be proper to comply with his wish, and enter into a private correspondence? I was young --not yet fifteen. I had no friend to whom I could apply for. counsel. No one lived, on whose affec- tion and solicitude for my welfare I could suffi- ciently rely, to confide to them even the secret of my authorship. I obeyed the promptings of incli- nation, and granted his desire. I eluded detection, by resorting to woman's wit in obtaining his com- munications from the P..O., though I mrny times escaped as by a: miracle! I learned, tfrn, that du. plicity is a constant trouble! Uncle Will wasmy agent-his ignorance and affection :/- shield. I  liked Mr. Sutherland more and more, until I finally committed the absurdity of " falling in love" with one I  never saw, only through the instrumen- tality of Dagueree, and in two yeara from the recep- tion of his- introductory letter, we were betrothed! I  hesitated to enter into an engagement until itf could be made -verbally, but my objections were overruled. He was going away to Europe to be ' :   '28    THE STRANGER 'S STRATAGEM. absent two years, and pleaded for an interchange of vows before his departure. He relied implicitly upon my truth and faithfulness, and should rest content, during his long absence, with my simple promise of, marriage on his return. I loved him: he was the only one on earth, of my own race, that loved me, and-I promised I My relatives would, doubtless, rejoice to be re- lieved of such an incumbrance, and I consulted my own feeling without revealing to them my posi- tion. - We exchanged miniatures, rings'and tresses, and he embarked in the steamerfor Liverpool-- and with him went all the cheerfulness and hope I had enjoyed since my yearning heart first found a resting-place in his own. Again I felt all alone in the world; the *ide ocean rolled between us; per- haps its green waters would flow on forever, and sunder us as widely! One year had passed away-it had not cooled the long-ago warmth of my heart for the distant 'wanderer. But-now I'had found another love, and I grew cold with fear lest my engagement should incense my uncle. I was "in a strait' betwixt two.    CHAPTER    IV. I LOOKED down upon'the pledge-ring upon my finger--beneath were the initials "S. S." and- with my elbow upon the trunk-lid, I rested my lips upon the golden circlet, while I contemplated the likeness of my absent lover. He was not handsome-I was glad of that-but noble in person, and interesting in countenance. The hair was jet black and curly, and lay in thick masses upon the full temples. The forehead was very broad and high; I  would not' have pledged him my hand, had it not been--Ihad studied Spurzt heim's Phrenology, and subscribed heartily to his doctrine; my own observation had convinced me of its validity. My aunt's brow was high but narrow, and her organ of Benevolence painfully low. She was jealous as a Chinese-exacting and unmerciful to servants and dependents. iMy aunt's cerebral organization perfectly satisfied me of the truth of Dr. Spurzheim's theory. I made the configuration of her head the test of his science, and not in one instance did its developments refute his argument! My lover's organ of Locality was depressed, while those of Tune, Causality and Comparison were very (29)   80    THE STRANGER S STRATAGEM; prominent. He was not erratic in temperament, I thought, and possessed a tendency to metaphysics and profound research. Thus far 1his appearance pleased me perfectly. I was unable to decide upon the precise color of his -eyes; they were not black nor blue-either a dark'grey, or light hazel. They were large and full, betokening fluency of speech. I knew he was an orator, at heart-his letters were rainbows of poetic beauty, studded with star gems of sense and reason. The face was oval in" contour, and wholly destitute of the fashionable appurtenance of the present day. It looked young, but manly. The mouth-was finely cut, with a slight indentation in either corner, the effect of a seemingly irresistible smile. The mouth was, to me, the only objectionable feature, i had strange notions for a girl of seventeen. My cousin Edith would hav'e ridiculed me for object- ing to that soft, unconscious smile; but I did regret its existence. A grave, even stern compression of those lips, indicating energy and indomitable will, would far better have suited my odd fancy; but I made the circumstances under which he sat, an- apology for' the light, half-quizzical expression abouf that softened mouth. I knew he possessed energy and strength of character, despite that effeminate seem- ing. I contrasted it withl my own, and they sug- gested June and mid-winter: Mine was emphati- cally like " patience on a monument." I wondered how he could insist upon an engagement, after be- holding my plain, sunless semblance, and w[th his kiiowledge, too, of my position in my uncle's faily, ,- .{   v%, l; s DOUBLE DECEIT.    31 for I had told him all. I had never received an in- timation of his circumstances, though I was unavoid- ably led to suppose him an aspiring artist. I only knew he possessed a high soul, and independent spirit, whatever might be his social position and pe- cuniary condition. I breathed a sigh of regret over the manly shade; not tha;t'I loved. him less, but the thought of my am- bitious uncle filled me with vague sensations of dis- coritent and dread. Had he bedn thus kind,.years ago, I had not thus sighed. over my duplicity. . But there was no recanting now, and whatever was Syd- ney Sutherland's station, I would fulfil my engage- ment, though it subjected me to the fate of my own poor mother. Twelve months subsequent to. that night I was again the lonely occupant of that chamber, in that precise position, and -filled with such gloomy fore- bodings of my uncle's wrath. I longed to m ake a revelation,-but my soul still faltered at the thought Like St. Paul, I had " finished my course," for my school days'were all ended. They had been 1alm, but notjoyous. At the Seminary Ihad formed ew  acquaintances, and had no intimate friends. I lad acquired the titles of "Old  Maid" and " Little un" ' while Edith had been fattered and caressed I her. heart's content. She coolly turned me over the neat gravest pupil, as room-mate, and- recv- t , i my stead, Lucy Greenwood, a gay, lovely nd  i ealthy girl, from Richmond, .Va Secretl, I con  -Mond,{    - 'Secr S  .*          *  - . .   32    THE STRANGER'S STRATAGEM; gratulated myself upon the exchange, for Edith's lively tongue and restless temperament sadly inter- fered with my studies. Mary Lane, my room-mate, was a congenial spir- it. -We talked little and studied much. She was evidently as ambitious of excelling, as myself, and I think as sincere a friendship spranga up between us as could exist between two whose inner lives were not revealed in words. I only knew that she de- signed teaching after the expiration of her scholastic term. I parted with her more sorrowfully than I had ever said farewell to one of my own sex. Years after, she married a wealthy and worthy man-one capable of appreciating her mental love- liness. She was not handsome, but gifted and good. Mary Lane's beauty was that which outlives the years. Miss Greenwood's brother was a college chum of my cousin Ernest, and two months after our return home, they fulfilled their promise of visiting my cousins. Charles' Greenwood was strikingly handsome, and I soon discovered that Edith's beauty had cap- tivated hisyoung fancy, while Ernest was equally enamored of the fair Lucy, and I foresaw a duplicate union of the two aristocratic houses, at no distant day. To the two visitors, I was a mere stranger. They looked down upon me as only the "poor cous- in," and considered it beneath their dignity and sta- tion to notice one so low, Charles was handsome, but his beauty was of an r 1r *   'OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.    33 effeminate order-soft, and destitute of strength and self-reliance. Adversity would have driven him to degradation; he could not have borne up manfully, beneath a burden -that required energy to shake off. Lucy was a greenhouse plant, that a -breath of winter air would have chilled and blighted. We were going to Edith's maternal aunt's, at the time our story opens, to attend the grand celebra- tion of her cousin Ellen's seventeenth natal day. A brilliant - ball was to usher her into society as a "finished young lady," and Edith and Lucy were on the qui vive for the excitement. Reader, I was a preacher's daughter, with a soul widely at variance with such scenes. and was not going from any desire of my own, but to gratify my uncle, who privately insisted upon my accompanying my cousins; for, as a member of his family, I had been included in the general invitation. My aunt and Edith gravely heard my assent, and looked surprised at the decision ; they were not aware that my uncle was the prime mover in the matter. I saw a sly smile exchanged between them, evidently at thoughts of the fine figure I would undoubtedly cut in that brilliant assembly. It did not affect my feelings, for I was inured to such silent significance, from them, with reference to my uncomely visage. I was puzzled by Edith's repugnance to the "Percival " on that occasion. True, she had advo- cated the cause of temperance pretty-eloquently for the last two months, but her abhorrence for wine I had never seen so fully evidenced as now. Soon 2*   34    THE STRANGERS STRATAGEM; after our return from the seminary, we attended a temnperance lecture-the speaker had located him? self in town during our absence. Mortimer MAan- ley, Esq., the orator, was a nan of rare powers, of burning eloquence, and his denunciations of the "ruby woe," on that- occasion, had d6ubtless struck conviction to the heart of my beautiful cousin. He had been an occasional' visitor at my uncle's since that time ;-Edith' beauty and wit were powerful attractions to the-" lords of creation." To me he was yet a; stranger, I had never met him in the social circle : I was not considered a parlor orna- ment, and rarely appeared there from inclination. My autnt and cousin were satisfied with my disposi- tion for'retirement, though my uncle opposed and ridiculed my predilection, and sometimes pushed nie into society mightily against my will. I saw his motives were an advantageous marriage, and shrank from the conviction, for I was already wed- ded in heart to Sydney Sutherland, even had I the power of winning another; I wished to :remain in seclusion until he came to astound my relatives with an expos6 of our position. Mr. Manley passed quickly, and stepped into the waiting boat, as Ernest uttered his reply to Lucy's -badinage. I saw Edith color: as she beheld him, and screen her face. Ernest observedhim also. "Now, there goes the- great Temperance Lecturer, sig i--if he can patronize the bar-keeping boat, you can. -No excuse for your- obstinacy now. We shall lose an hour by such nonsense-come along, I say!"   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     35, Ernest sprang out of the omnibus, and drew Lacy gently after him, grimacing at- Edith, as he went. Charles clasped her hand, -and lifted her tenderly out. She made a feint of resistance-for I saw it was only a feint. She went gladly. I followed without assistance; no one feared for my neck .or delicacy. I was no heiress, and could "help myself."        .  My curiosity was wide awake, and I watched them closely. Was that gay and volatile girl cap- tured by a poor lawyer? Mr. Manley was only a poor lawyer, but his talents and superior powers compensated for a deficiency in wealth, evidently. He was universally courted and admired. But he- was only a poor lawyer, and my proud uncle would never sanction their union, I felt confident. I fore- saw Edith destined to trouble if she really loved hi-m. A group of gentlemen stood around the entrance- way-among them was Mr. Manley. . I saw Edith's face turn towards him. He was not looking at her; his eyes were bent towards the black waters. I had never been so near. him, before. .He looked strangely interesting. I forgot, to " consider my ways" and stepped ,upon my travelling skirt, as I went up the slight ascent. I stumbled and fancied myself going down into the waters, at the boat's side. My company had stepped on deck, and were proceed- ing to tie cabin regardless of mee, I grasped at air,  and uttered an involuntary cry, as I went over-over into the steamer, headlong! I did not land upon -yJ.;    X36    THE STRANGER'S STRATAGEM. the deck, but a softer substance came in contact with my waist and- breast. I was blind, for a mo- ment, -by the propelling power that launched me for- ward ;-when my vision cleared, I found myself in the arms of Mortimer Manley! He had sprung for- ward; and arrested my fall. I disengaged myself and looked up in his eyes as I stammered-some words of thanks. Reader, I did not look long-why, I could not tell then, nor there- after. He smiled as I met his eye, and that smile startled something away down in my soul, that had never been agitated before. My heart felt as though under the influence of a galvanic battery ; its wild throbs shook my entire frame. It might have been the effect of the fall, but I dated my in- constancy to Sydney Sutherland, from that mo- ment It              ( Edith returned hastily when she beheld me in Mr. Manley's arms. I did not see them exchange glances, I was too flustered to look up. He saw my nervous state, and kindly drawing my arm within his own, conducted me to the cabin. He had a soul to feel for one in my poor and unprotect- ed condition. He seated me comfortably,and passed over to Edith. His face was from me, as they conversed, but hers- was radiant with- satisfaction. I felt in my heart a strange wish of mingled: anguish and remorse, as I beheld them--a wish that I had nzever -wet him!   CHAPTER V. I met thee in a luckless hour.--ToMsoN. M R. MANLEY did not remain long, but passed quietly and indifferently from the apartment. Ernest and Charles commented upon his appear- ance, after-his exit. "He never smiled in his life, I'll wager my hat!" ,said Ernest, with characteristic humor. "Nor had his hair cutl" returned Charles, wit- tily. "I'd give an X to see his face melt into sunshine, just for variety's sake!" continued Ernest. "I wonder if his powers of speech lie in the length of his locks!" responded Charles. "Then he's wise not to submit to be shorn"- chimed in the laughing Lucy.- Edith joined in the merriment at Mr. Manley's expense. She was obviously chagrined by his de- sertion; my quick eye made the discovery as he turned away. Her pride and self-sufficiency were mortified.

I read it in that proud glance. She looked brilliantly beautiful in the ball-room, thati night; I thought God had never created a lovelier being. I saw Mr. Manley's, eyes follow her, as she floated, like thistle-down on a balmy breeze, through the mazy dance. I tried to read his feel- ings, in his eyes. They were calm, but liquid, and his face was grave and placid, as when I saw him through the half-open door of-the steamer. He could not help loving her, I thought, but his discre-, tionary mind led him to a. system of wooing unlike that of those who fawned and fluttered around her. He was too proud and self conscious to bend easily. He would stand aloof awhile, and approach gradual, ly, at her inviting smiles.  3 I watched to see him lead her forth as a partner in the amusement, but he did not dance. I stood, upon a veranda, overlooking a wide gar- den, with a lattice of vine-work screening me from the dew.:' I had " no part nor lot" in the matter inside, and observed the glittering mass through' the open window. The night was cold, and the large full stars shone down, goldenly, through the clear atmosphere. I looked up at those twink- ling orbs with deeper unhappiness in my heart - .       '      OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.    41- than I had ever felt through all the years of my orphanage and dependence, for there was remorse and hopeless love there! I grieved for my engage- ment, my poverty, and plainness I I knew I had never loved Sydney Sutherland with all the capa- city that I then felt within me, but the knowledge ; had come too late!  I saw him approaching the window where I stood concealed. Would he come out? I asked myself, in trepidation. I looked around for a refuge, but saw none. I meditated springing from the portico into the garden, but the height forbade it; my neck would certainly suffer by the leap. Reader, he did come out I I saw his fine form outlined in the lamp-light. I had shrunk into the farthest corner of the veranda, and longed for the " invisible ring"I had heard of in my child- hood.                 ^ He hesitated a moment, upon discovering me, as though meditating a ietreat, then came slowly up. There was no possibility of escape,and I stood my ground bravely, externally, but there was a storm  within. He bowed as he recognized me. There was a grace, dignity*and composure in that gentle inclination. The brilliancy within revealed his" countenance; "Presuming upon the event of to-day, with refer- ence to which I may be considered and claim to be your benefactor-for which service I congratulate myself-may I know whom I rescued, lady?  My cousin had not even paid me this attention   42    THE STRANGER S STRATAGEM; and respect. She doubtless considered it an indig- nity, to the - distinguished man, to introduce one so far beneath hilm in station. "Mabel Hastings, Mr. Manley." "; Miss Hastings?" I bowed\ assent.

Will you dance, Miss Hastings?" "I never dance, sir."  ' I was moving towards the window, for I longed to escape fromn his vicinity.

"Are you satisfied to remain?" "Yes, sir." "And not a bit cold?" "No, sir." The -ease and friendly familiarity with which he addressed me, dispelled every sensation of awe and timid fear, with which I had hitherto regarded him. His considerate care and kindly expression placed me at perfect ease. He appeared like a friend of long years gone by. He stood silent some moments looking out into the purple darkness, and up at the golden eyes glancing from the violet heavens. "Don't you love the, beautiful night,.

His tone and attitude inspired me, and I spoke more freely than I had ever addressed another.. My timidity vanished, for I felt that I was in com- munion with a kindred spirit-one that could sym- pathize with my every thought and emotion. I had never before been brought in personal contact with so congenial a mind, and I was drawn out ir- resistibly.  "I do; sir.

The query resolved me into myself. I dropped my eyes from the stars to his face, and its expres- sion confused me. He was smiling, and that smile destroyed my equanimity, but I answered, with all the indifference I could command: "As a visionary school-girl I have sometimes at- tempted to perpetrate rhyme, Mr. Manley." "Do you ever publish your productions, fair lady?" "I am not recognized as a litterateur, sir." "I beg your pardon; I see the subject annoys you ; only gratify me on one point, Miss Hastings." "Certainly, sir, if possible," "What nameido you assume, as a writer? ; I tortured my brain for an expedient. "There I no evasion-don't refuse me. I claim to have a right to that bit of confidence. Why, you might have broken your neck, but for my arms! You owe me your life, perhaps-glorious thoughtl--can't you confide in me that far?" Reader, his tone-his gentle demeanor-got the victory.

I expected to have the answer spokenl in my ear, as I lay; but no reply came-the " spirit had taken its flight." It needed no mysterious, supernatural agency to injluience me, for I loved him but too well, for I loved him hopelessly. I was betrothed to another, and a few more weeks would consummate our union!  Sydney iSutherland was then homeward bound, and I writhed in spirit as I mentally re-perused his last soulful missive. He had not changed, in heart, while in a day his image had been supplanted in -mine, and I bemoaned my engagement, almost his existence I I was deeply humiliated, in my own estimation; I buried my face in the pillow and wept tears of shame and anguish. I had peculiar ideas of betrothal, for I considered myself already wedded, iri God's sight, to Sydney Sutherland, and I would as soon have eloped with Mortimer Manley, from a lawful husband, as violate my marital prom- ise..  He was noble, he was more than worthy of me, he had sought, me when there was none other to cheer and love me, and I had thus returned his con- descension and affection 1 With thb late assurance he had given me of his constancy, I firmly resolve to fulfil my engagement, tnd thus inflict upon my contemptible nature the penalty of its treason!

Reader, I did soul- penance for the sin of INCONSTANCY. The hum of gay voices--the deep roll of revolv- ing wheels, bearing away the happy revellers, died out.

He had set his heart upon marrying me off advantageously ;-lle dictated my course and I obeyed him, tacitly. I could not rebel without betraying my secret engagement and authorship. I had urged his approval of my school-teaching'plan, buthe sternly silenced me. There was no alterna- tive but to submit -to his will, until Sydney Suth- erland's arrival. I knew he would turn me-from his door, if- my lover were a poor man, but I could brave his displeasure if honor demanded it; I did not covet his wealth-his love was a richer jewel than his heavy coffers could purchase.

Mr. Manley stood'aloof from me in the drawing room, and I carefully avoided his eyes. Once I met them inadvertently; they were very deep and searching-they shook up my inner being like a storm-sweep over a deep sea! I could not endure his smile-for he did smile, reader-and bowed-as calmly and complacently as though he had never uttered those memorable words, in that heart- thrilling tone, in the cold moonlight, far over the blue waters-"Oh, Mabel I "   52    THE STRANGER S STRATAGEM; He sat beside Edith, who was radiant with smiles -ani --conscious beauty. I knew he could never be aught to me, but the scene sickened me and I avoid- ed it. I longed for a " lodge in some vast wilder- ness,"- where I might never hear or behold him again I Edith's jealousy had subsided-the suspension of our friendship, so sentimentally formed, had quieted the green-eyed monster, and its reptile head had ceased to protrude through her suspicious and invidious nature. She had .never alluded to the circumstance upon the steamer. I observed my uncle in close conversation with a !townsman, who bore the reputation of "much money and small sense!"My surprise was only equalled by my annoyance, when they approached me, and I was honored with an introduction. lMr. Singleton was my shadow for the remainder of the evening I I wondered if he were enamored of me, or the prospect of. a portion of my uncle's wealth, in the future. Reader, I learned, subsequently, that my careful- relative had communicated his design concerning me, and thus heightened my charms in Mr. Singleton's -avaricious big blue eyes I I shrank from observation, for the whole scene was distasteful. I yearned for-my quiet chamber, and took refuge in a window recess ; but I was not, permitted to enjoy it. My officious uncle drew me forth, and sat me down- to the piano.

I felt his eyes looking down upon my face, but did not lift my own. I knew he sought to convince me of his indifference by his calm demeanor, and struggled to repay him in coolness. H-is presence deranged mv nerves, but I made 'a mighty effort to compose them. I ran my fingers over the keys to test their strength; they trembled, and I made a feint, to gain time. I had hitherto been so firm, that to falter now-would subject me to suspicion. -"Love him " The whisper came from my bosom, deep but distinct--the same sound I had heard twice before, and produced the same effect! I could not sing, now--I could not retain my seat. I sprang up, in terror. My appearance was a sufficient apology for my abrupt departure, and I was permitted to retire on plea of sudden indisposition. My uncle followed me to my chamber, and con- gratulated me upon my conquest. Mr. Singleton had requested permission to address his neice, and he had accorded it. I delayed the trying time, and   -54    THE STRANGERCS STRATAGEM; left him to indulge his own fancies. I was misera- ble enough, now, without calling down his indigna- tion and wrath upon my defenceless head. -I exerted all my tact to delay Mr. Singleton's pro- posal until Sydney Sutherland's arrival, but my mental state impaired my physical health.

Oh, what a goodly outside falsehood hath Here is-my hand for my true constancy, Therefore devise with me, how -we may fly. Shakspeare. DEADER, there in the deep shade, with no hu- man eye to behold me, I blushed for the small-  ness of soul that could thus influence a lovely being, animated by a spark of Divinity. Beautiful and accomplished- as she was, she prostituted her noble intellect to the gratification of the inferior feelings, and wantonly trifled with a loving heart! I thanked Heaven that, poor and plain as I was, I was her superior in one respect--I could boast of a broader and higher soul. Edith's words excited me--she. suspected my love for Mr. Manley, and henceforth t should be the sub- ject of scrutiny. I resolved to deceive her. I wondered if Mr. Manley did love me; I had seen nothing to indicate it since my flight from the ver- anda. It was only her greens eyes that troubled her. The snake was yet in its nest, though hidden from me  I I wondered, too, if my aunt's suspicions were well-founded. Had II ever loved Mr. Single- ton, I would- not have accepted him now, until I (60)   THE DOUBLE DECEIT,      61 had fully tested the sincerity of his attachment. I would not sell myself for gold,neither would I consent to purchase a husband. My ideas of mar- riage were too high and, holy to permit me to make it a mere matter of convenience. I believed that  God created souls in pairs and dropped them from the skies--that the concussion dissevered the spirit- twins -and sent them wandering far apart in the earth, but designed a final meeting; and that the vast amount of unhappiness existing in connubial life was but the result of thwarting his design. Few sought and waited for their spirit-twin, but mated with antipodal minds, nor considered " mar- riage a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship." Fate sometimes intervened-it had come between me and mine, foq too late, too late, I had met my soul's duplicate! I knew, by the chirography, it was from Sydney Sutherland, as uncle Will laid the letter in my hand. My fingers trembled as I broke the seal. It was dated from his own homel He had safely crossed- and re-crossed the dark-rolling Atlantic. The letter- had- been delayed, :and, to-morrow he would -be with me I      .- w I sat in the back parlor, all alone-my -aunt:and cousin had gone out for an airing, I -Saw the car- riage'roll away with them, and Mr- Manley. , Edith had triumphed; i saw it in her happy, radiant;face. How beautiful she looked, and!-how -pale- and                 s   62    THE STRANGER'S STRATAGEM ; wretched I I did not hate her, but, reader, I pitied hlm. I knew he would take to his arms a hypo- critical mercenary--one who could trifle with the heart's best affections, and feel no compunctions of conscience! She was not worthy of him. I laid my head on the window-sill-the south wind fluttered through and drifted a flood of fra- grance from the early spring blossoms in the leafy garden. I saw no beauty in the beautiful; there were no charms in nature for me then. I shut my eyes, 'andtried to shut my heart to all thoughts of Mor-timer Manley, but the very effort only con- strained me to think- of him the more! "Lodve him!" It was the same whisper, the same deep, sepulchral tone!" had heard once before I A shiver ran icy through my veins, but I asked audibly, to test the spirit: '"Love whom?" and the answer came-low, very low, but dis tiy enunc iated in my ear: I fancied "I even felt -the breath of the whisperer upon my cheek: ;; Mortimer Manley!" :I was all alone,-no human being was visible, no footsteps of servants were heard in all the mansion. Was it fancy? The sound was unnatural, hollow, and unearthly; it seemed far away, yet felt very near. If it were a spirit-wlisper, it could not pro- ceed from a beatified soul; it was Satan, in the form of an ' angel of light," tempting me to violate my vow I I doubted the evidence of my own senses, but uttered impulsively:   OR, THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     63 "' Get thee behind me, Satan!"' as the passage- occurred to my excited min; "'resist the devil ? and lie will flee from you.'o" I was shaking from head to foot, when a servant entered, and announced Mr. Manley! '"Tell him I am not well!"I entreated in an agony. But it was too late; I saw him cross the front parlor, and was observed. He came in, and sat down by me. "You are not well? I am not surprised at it, you live so lonely. Why don't you seek society more?  I havn't seen you in three weeks, only at church, while your cousin is found at every place of amusement." "We differ in taste and disposition, sir: she finds her happiness there-I don't." "Are you unhappy? . Your appearance would in-  dicate it. You reprove me for my presumption with that glance.

I approached you at the party; here, to prove my power over your heart. I saw it in yqor trembling fingers, and agitated face, and frightened you then to spare your confu- sion, and impress you deeper. I tried then to ob- tain an interview, and failed. You avoided -me, and I saw your cousin did not regret your alience from the drawing-room. I then planned for this hour. You know my letters always passed through the hands of a friend, during my wanderings in Europe-that was for a purpose. I meant to return earlier than you anticipated, and prosecute my ro- mantic and cherished scheme. I have written you twice since my residence here, and had them mailed in my own horme. That friend is now in town,-at tmy desire. I stationed him at a certain point, and invited your aunt and cousin to an airing, and made my friend's sudden appearance an apology for deserting them! It was rather ungallant, but they excused me, through his ingenious device: I saw you at the window, ere the servant announced me, and startled you again. She went up stairs- in your chamber, I presume-to find you, and thus favored my plan. I wished to make you as misera- ble as possible before the disclosure, knowing, that sunshine looks all the brighter for bursting through a cloud."              1 "You won'tf continue the practice, Mr. Manley?

The mountains showed their grey heads; the blue face of ocean smiled.-OSSIAN. pHEY regarded me gravely and suspiciously,- 1 my aunt and cousin,-when the bell summoned us into the supper-room. I knew the servant had informed them of Mr. Manley's visit during their absence; I read the truth in their cold counte- nances. "I wonder what has become of Mr. Singleton," said Edith, carelessly, as she sipped her tea. I saw - she was following her mother's advice, and " sound- ing my intentions ;"--" he hasn't called in several days." "Ah?"-my uncle looked up from   his plate, and eyed me narrowly.  I sat grave and quiet, apparently unconscious of his scrutiny. Had I obeyed the impulse of my heart, I should have laughed outright, reader. I had no fear of opposi- tion, now, although I had declined to become Mrs. Singleton.   - "Not in several days Hwhere's your beau, Bel?" "I don't know, Iuncle."

To be sure he hasn't all the sense in the world-not half as much as Solomon-but that shouldn't hang him; he's just as God made him. Do you despise him for his simplicity?" "No, sir.". "What the mischief did you refuse him for?" "Because I don't love him, uncle, as one ought, to marry." "Fiddlesticks and flummery!-just like your mother --she was everlastingly ranting about love!

My uncle's plate jingled with the sud- den fall of his knife, as he pulled me around the cor- ner upon his lap, where I got a good hugging for a few moments. "The Lord bless me! I am confounded! I thought you loved me too well to deceive me so, Bel?" - I told him all, the why and wherefore, only re- serving a few facts to subserve my purpose. "And this Sydney Sutherland will appear to- morrow? Suppose I don't like him and forbid the match?" "I shall be sorry, sir ; I want your sanction." "But you wouldn't obey, eh?" "I don't think you have any right to oppose it, if he is worthy, and I like him, uncle., "And you'll elope, right upon the spot, hey?" "Never I 'twould go against my conscience. I'll marry boldly, or die an old maid."   OR7 THE DOUBLE DECEIT.     88 a But you'll take him and march straight out be- fore my eyes, and snap your fingers in my face if I oppose you, eh?" "No, sir; I owe you the obedience of a child, for your care and kindness. If you forbid me to marry him because of his poverty, I will remain in celibacy until I am of age, but with the understanding that I will fulfil my engagement then. If you turn me from your door because of this confession, I will go boldly to the altar and fulfil it now." "Well, I'll be hanged if you hav'n't the brass of a Boston lawyer. You sit right here upon my knee, and look straight in my eyes without flinch- ing, and tell me. plump and plain you will have him, in spite of sin and Satan, and yet assume to be mighty obedient!

I s'pose I'd have to keep you here, in silks and satins, three years, and then see you tied to the scapegrace at last; unless-you shaAnt have him-I'll make you marry Singleton!"

Little Ralph resigned his luggage to the old cook, receiving as a reward for his labor, the kind- hearted assurance: "Dat's a good boy-so 'tis, honey ;" and slipping through the back door, his tiny feet made tracks for the grape-arbor at the lower end of the large garden.

The little fellow caught up his old tattered straw hat, and hurried off to do his mistress' bidding, with a quiver about his pale, sorrowful mouth, and two big tears oozing through his long, jetty lashes.

Who stole the livery of the court of heaven, To serve the devil in.--POLJOCK. HE history oflittle Ralph Reginald's parents was similar to that of thousands who had lived before them--filial disobedience, poverty, and pre- mature death. Strangers in a strange land, but little was known of their former circumstances and social position, though their refined manners and cultivated minds evidenced a brighter'fortune and more elevated station in earlier years. In his fifth year, little Ralph was left fatherless, and his delicate, consumptive mother bequeathed him to the cold charities of the world, ere ten sum- mers had shed their sunshine and shade over his helpless head. To maintain her reputation for benevolence and exemplary Christian character, how obtained, only the hypocritical pretender can elucidate! Mrs. Penton received the friendless orphan under her roof, and thus added another laurel toathe crown of conceded righteousness. - Mris. Fenton was a prominent member of the Protestant Episcopal Church. She sighed devoutly over her elegant prayer-book, and received, at the holy altar, the broken body and shed blood of our (96)   THE ROD AND REPROOF.      97  Lord Jesus Christ, while her little pale prqotgd was weeping tears of childish anguish over the memory of his dead mother, in her dark and dingy ? a garret, or spelling out the words in his liAtie I  primer, off in some quiet nook of the old garden, wrapped in the cast-away garments of her elegantly attired son, who, though one year the junior of little Ralph, sat demurely beside his dignified and pious (?) mother, in her richly cushioned and " carpeted pew, only restrained from squirming and yawning with soul-weariness by the reflection of "a certain something after that" when the hall door of his home had closed behind him. Master Bob knew from past experience, it was "better to brave the ills he had," than to provoke an after-piece. The world commended her charity,: and Mrs. Fenton smiled saint-like, as she received its flatter- ing expressions of admiration and praise. Little Ralph had never heard her soft, silvery voice in the outer world, or he would not have recognized her in the domestic circle, for Mrs. Fenton's religion, like the chameleon, changed with surrounding circumstances. Mrs. Fenton was "monarch of all she surveyed," in her elegant home. Her liege lord, little meek- eyed Lawrence, had wedded her for convenience, and was constitutionally formed to be wholly con- tent with a No. 2 position under his matrimonial roof. Physically little Lawrence would have come out of a  connubial contest second best, as-his physique grew "small by degrees and beautifully   ?',f * 98    REGINALD'S REVENGE; OR, less.' beside his magnificently constructed conjugal partine -  "   :Mr. nd .Mrs. Fenton's wedded life was mild as 1^^'": '4" ay:!o rning, so far as- they individually were cofncerned i for little X Lawrence invariably suc- cumbed toi*s better-half's superior judgment, and beat a hasty; retreat before her two-edged sword of a tongue, whenever it betrayed symptoms of an onslaught among the children and servants, and all opposing forces. - Mr. Fenton verified to the letter the old adage -" first at a feast and last at a fray," as his rotund little person and full moon of a face bore ample testimony. He would sit an hour at his sump- tuous boatrd, luxuriating in the delicacies before him, and run as fast as his well-gorged corporation would admit, from the slightest premonition of a domestic squabble. He was good-natured, as all lazy imitations of manhood are, and though no church-member, was less feared and better loved by his children and servants, than their sanctimonious mother and mis- tress. Little Ralph would have found a kind shelter under his protecting wing, but for his pusillanimous fear of incensing his domineering spouse. He sat silently, as she dealt blows upon the : -ophan's little weary head, and offered him a kind word in secret. He knew he was indebted to her for the wealth he enjoyed, and was too indolent and grateful Ito mahifest disapprobation of her conduct. His only recommendation, previous "to   THE ROD AND REPRj0pF.     99 marriage, was his handsome face i and yielding H spirit; she could not have tolerated a self-reliant lover.         .

Weak and ignoble as his spirit was, we will not slander human nature by asserting that Mr. Fenton loved his wife. He confessed secretly, that he had never harbored the tender passion; his mental mechanism was too frail to sustain the burden. In his youthful days Cupid had come in contact with the immaterial, infinitesimal network that encloses every human heart, but the meshes expanded, and ' let the blind god through the lymphatic contrac- tion of his amorous organization I Mr.. Fenton smiled in his sleeves at his wife's profession of religion, but wisely held his peace, and stubbornly refused to enter the church militant, notwithstanding he was constantly importuned by his pious pastor to submit to confirmation. Mr. Fenton thought if Mrs. Fenton was a fair specimen of the church's piety, he could manage to get to heaven without it; and, thus he travelled on down the winding-way of time, stumbling at every step  over his wife's hypocrisy!   100    REGINALD'S REVEXNGE; OR, "Let me help you to some of the steak, my dear -:-said Mr. Fenton one morning.  "No, thank you--it is fast-day; you know I commune All  on Sulday." Mr. :Fenton dropped the steak like a, A a:rMd hot ball, cleared his throat lustily, and fell to dispatching the solids before him like a famished. wolf. He ate more -than usual, even, that breakfast- time, as though to make up for his pious wife's sacrifice. Little Ralph entered with a plate of hot mpffins, soon after Mrs. Fenton's declension of her lord's proffer on the score of fast-day; for the poor orphan was not permitted to sit at table with the rich family, but took his meals in the kitchen with the servants, and was subjected to any office that kept him in constant motion, in order to " pay for his keeping." Mrs. Fenton eyed him sharply, and at length burst forth: "You-haven't combed your hair to-day, you lazy rascal!" Little Ralph's poorly-patched knees quivered, as he answered apologetically: - I ain't got no comb, ma'am."  "You havein't?--what's gone with it, sir?" "I dunno, manam-the mice carried it off, I 'speet, and T'fore I could find it, this morning you called me to go-" "Shut your mouth, you impudent rascal!-- "slap!" and little Ralph's black hair flew about under "the blow"-" now -take that, you saucy imp,   THE ROD AND 'REPROOF.     101 and dare to speak to me in that brazen manner again, you dependent puppy." Little Ralph went. sobbing from the room, with one ragged jacket-sleeve wiping off his bitter or- phan-tears, while Mrs. Fenton lolled piously back at the head of her elegant board, and "abstained from meats," at the Lord's command! Mr. Fenton gulped down his fourth cup of fra- grant mocha, and hastily buttoning up his coat, without a word, but with a close compression of his handsome mouth, sallied off to the store, muttering -for he had read the Bible, in other years, when his sainted mother taught him to fold his plump baby-hands at her knee, and lisp " our Father"- "but the greatest of these is charity"-" sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal-!"  "I have subscribed one hundred dollars to the -- Society, Mr. Fenton ; you will call and pay it, as you return to the store to-morrow"--said Mrs. Fenton, one evening. "Ah I that is a large sum, my dear, to give in charity for such a purpose."7 "Yes, but Mrs. Farley contributed that amount, and I was unwilling to be less liberal than my neighbors,; besides, it is for a worthy purpose; and I feel disposed to contribute largely for the amelio- ration of the condition of those miserable, ignorant, and naked islanders*"  Mr. Fenton, just then; caught sight of little Ralph's pale, peaked face and ragged clothing, as his bony, hoseless feet sloshed along in a pair of ^    *    102    REGINALD S REVENGE; OR, his wife's old castoff shoes, but he made no com- ments. He handed over the hundred dollars, in obedi- ence to Mrs. Fenton's orders, and heard his wife's piety and benevolence eulogised by the Secretary of the Society, and other admiring ignoramuses, but he "was dumb with silence; he opened not his mouth." Could they have-looked down-into his heart then, they would have read: "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy!" As M-r. Fenton entered his store, the thread of his thoughts was snapped in twain, the last end of whichl was,--" that they may have praise of, men!" Mrs. Fenton's pious consideration for the poor islanders on far St. Helena, was deeply felt and deplored in her kitchen, and among the needy in her vicinity. She was " not at home" to mendicants at her door, and the fare sent to the culinary de- partment was scant and frugal enough, in all con- science, to satisfy the most rigid Grahamite! Aunt Dinah was reduced to the absolute necessity of filching from the cupboard and larder, to satisfy the demands of her own and little. Ralph's ali- mentiveness, in spite of principle. She appeased her conscience by pleading the urgency of the case. A buttered biscuit was a luxury little Ralph never enjoyed, only through her ingenuity, or rather com- pulsory theft I; "I hates 'er-I dus so!" muttered little Ralph,   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     103 as he dragged his tired feet along towards his master's store--"I'll kill her, when I gits big-I will!

Little Ralph lifted his. large, tearful eyes to the blue , heavens half-incredulously: scepticism was crepping into his young heart, and there was no intelligent -mind to save him from the black gulf of unbelief His hard fortune was leading him slowly but steadily onward, away from the precepts of his earlier youth; oppression was solidifying his soft and susceptible soul. :-HEe tluggedl- the heavy bundle to his austere mis- tress, as fast as his childish strength would .permit, and got, in return, a frown and a cuff for his tardi- nessi Waves of hate and vindictiveness surged over his young soul, and his black eyes blazed with passion, as he shook his little fist defiantly'in her astonished face,-for human nature could endure no -more, and excited Ralph crossed the Rubicon of opensrebellion.

Regardless of wringing and breaking a heart Already to sorrow resigned.-CowrPE. TWO years passed away, and brought no change to little Ralph, save hardness of heart and a deeper :yearning for revenge. His childish heart had grown strong and intrepid; he defied ghosts and hobgoblins, and slept as fearlessly, in his lonely and gloomy garret, among the scampering mice and chirping insects, as master Bob in his richly fur- nished and taper-lighted chamber. It was a soul-saddening contrast-the sallow, lean, overtasked, friendless little orphan boy, slum- bering from sheer fatigue, upon his coarse pallet of wheat-straw, made by auntf Dinah's kind but clumsy fingers, upon the dusty floor. of that dim, prison- looking attic, and the plump, pampered and rosy- cheeked youth, snoring amid the down and' snowy fixments of his costly couch, beneath the same roof I The angels looked down- from their star-homes nightly, and beheld a Dives and a Lazarus inbthe home of a professing Christian I With the dawn of day, little Ralph's perpetual round of monotonous and laborious duties began, (106) *     n                    s-   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     107 while the red morning sun had gone on his journey for hours, along the blue upland-way, ere master Bob rolled lazily from his cosy nest, and went, with hair "'like quills upon the fretful porcupine," snappish and yawning to his morning meal. Master Bob inherited his mother's nature, unfor- tunately, and snubbed the poor boy at will, for his own amusement, and with impunity, until Ralph's spirit rose, one day, when forbearance was no longer a virtue, and thrashed his tormentor to his heart's content.! His little back and shoulders suffered severely for the indulgence of his pug- nacity, from his indignant mistress' lash, but mas- ter Bob never thereafter ventured to provoke a similar chastisement from the poor boy. But the two youths were ever afterwards hostile to each other, and Bob embraced every opportunity to make his young foe feel the fire of his burning spite, whenever he could accomplish it beyond the reach of his returning shot. Little Nelhe was a fac simile of her father in person, and inherited the best traits of his charac- ter. She had, happily, escaped the -transmission of his weakest points, and combined his physical beau- ty with mental strength and intellectual bright- ness. In her was developed all that he might have been, through the exercise and culture of his in- herent possessions and powers. Little Nellie's superior feelings were strength- ened and promoted by a daily view of her mother's meanness! She saw the hideousness of her nature,   108    REGINALD'S REVENGe ;t OR, and deprecated its likeness. She was gentle and  obedient, but the antagonism of their temperaments repelled her warmest affections, and sent them over to her father in sympathy and congeniality. Mr. Fenton loved his daughter as he had never loved a human being since the days of his infancy; he had idolized his mother, but she was early taken from him, and an inebriate father was illy quali- fied to " train up a child in the way he should go ; thus the garden of his young heart was left to run to waste. There were germs of nobleness and beauty in his soul, but they had been early dwarfed and debilitated, and had never brought forth fruit to perfection. Nelhe was five years the junior of Ralph, and pitied the poor boy's condition from the inmost recesses of her sympathizing little heart. Mrs. Fenton forbade all intercourse between the chil- dren, lest her own should imbibe the mean spirit and plebian. sentiments of the young pauper, and Nel- lie's compassionate soul rebelled against the unjust interdiction. She had constituted herself Ralph's teaclter, and was tempted to 'duplicity by this ma- ternal prohibition. She secretly supplied the poor boy with books, and as often as opportunity offered, heard him recite his lessons. She did not always escape detection in- this labor of love, and her little ears blushed crimson beneath the heavy hand of her incensed mother. Mrs. Fenton considered that "beggars had no right to waste time over books!--paupers had no   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     109 business with education!-it would do them no good-not a whit! it was only an excuse for idle- ness in the lazy brat! No sensible woman would feed and clothe a .beggar for nothing!-'it would only be -encouraging laziness and training him up for the gallows!-a lazy pauper was the meanest of all creation, and she'd whip her (Nellie) within an inch of her life, if she (Mrs. Fenton) ever caught her at such low business again!" Such opposition only served to increase little Ralph's ambition for knowledge. He possessed a most inquiring- mind and a strength of character that impelled him to persevere in spite of all obsta- cles. He carried his book in his pocket, and de- voted to its pages every moment he could snatch from the fleeting hours. On Sunday he accom- plished much, for Mrs. Fenton durst not risk her reputation -for piety by requiring him to labor on that holy day. It was all " cold comfort " in her home, on the Sabbath, for Mrs. Fenton was entirely too religious' to allow a warm meal to appear on her table from Saturday night till Monday -morn- ing, and there was not one of her acquaintances but was perfectly well aware of the fact, so far as her assertion was relied upon; and aunt Dinah once informed Ralph in confidence that,- - ' Missus strains at a gnat an' swollers a camel, honey-dat's what!

Mrs. Fenton affirmed it was "all fool- ishness, and high time the brat had some bravery I She would not countenance such nonsense!" and poor Ralph " crept like a snail, unwillingly " up to his dark attic, trembling in every limb with child- ish fear, and rolled himself tightly up in his old faded covering, longing for the lazy Bob's light and cheerful room he had passed in his upward march. Mrs. Fenton's harsh discipline produced the effect of emboldening the poor boy, but it branded the word ' REVENGE?upon his young heart, with the fire of implacable hate! His once soft. and pliant soul grew hard and unimpressible as flint, and the gentle, meek child of- ten, was not recognizable, in the grim, stubborn boy of thirteen. He had ceased to try to please, for his best efforts met with no success, and he performed his duties mechanically, and with a cool indifference that produced the im- pression of sullen laziness. Mrs. Fenton's cruelty excited him to occasional outhreaks of uncontrollable passion, that she subse- quently cited as a palliation of her harshness; and Ralph's reputation among those who only casually saw him, and heard her sighing regrets for his per- verse nature, was far from enviable.% He could not have found a home among her visitors, had he applied at their doors, and many wondered: how she could harbor so obstinate and ungrateful a boy: her forbearance was attributed to her great piety I "    ;,  '   "2    REGINALD S REVENGE ; OR, Ralph knew, from the cold glances he met, how dhe was regarded, and his pale lips compressed more sternly, as he looked back defiance in their unsympathizing eyes.

Gradually he had ceased to repeat his morning and evening prayers--at night he was too cross, and in the morning too hurried; but in his softer moments, Ralph's little heart upbraided him/for the neglect, and he prayed over his tasks in memory of his dead mother, and promised her spirit to be better infuture.

He could have excelled Bob in both branches, had they been brought together and tested, for there was will and desire on the poor orphan's part, while only necessity prompted the rich boy to partially commit his daily lessons. "I'll do it!" muttered Ralph, as he whirled over one half of the book before him, with his restless left hand upon his right clenched fist--"I won't stayv here one hour longer-dog if I do I It's work, scold, beat, bang, all day long, and I won't stand it any longer.

WTHEN the morning sun glanced through the crimson curtains of the east, and beheld the startled countenances of the inmates of Fenton Hall, little Ralph was far away, trudging along the high-road, with his bundle on his back, swung over his shoulder upon a hickory stick. Friendless Ralph felt free as the birds that twittered among the boughs above his old straw hat, and he now and then whistled a merry strain to the wild warblers that fluttered about his path, and peeped at him through the leaves with their shining black eyes. Ralph had intentionally taken a southern course, and when the round red sun lay down in a purple pile of gorgeous clouds in the low west, the ab- sconding youth had measured many miles from the home of his h6artless and hated mistress. He had found a friend, during his- journey, in the person of an old grey-headed negroess, who re- minded him of aunt Dinah by her pitying expres- sions for the forlorn child, and supplied him plenti- fully with food sufficient for the day's march.

Ralph now began to look about him for a lodg- ment-for the night. His day's journey had been pleasant and -prosperous, but the country was dark and wild, and thinly populated, and he feared to sleep among the trees lest, peradventure, a hungry beast might make a meal of his small self, without any scruples of conscience! Ralph's black hair began to stand on end with apprehension, as the twilight deepened around him and no signs of a human habitation became visible. He-was reflecting seriously upon the advisability of taking a tree for the night, and trusting to Providence till morning, when the" gee-haw!" of a' guttural voice fell upon his eager ear. Ralph had never- heard so musical a sound before, not- withstanding the deep bass and rude cadence of the human voice. Presently an ox-cart emerged from the woods, a little in advance of the young wayfarer, with a isable driver perched sideways upon the tongue, -+ :and both mammoth feet pendulating with the zig- zag movements of the tired team, in close proximity to the ground and rear hoofs of the yoked quad- rupeds.

"Please let me ride a little bit, uncle? I'm mighty tired." "Sartin', chile--jump up behine dar-gee-haw! git up heer 1" and another lash fell lumbering upon the tough beasts--"Got any 'baccy, massy?"

"Luddy-massy! we's got cullerd chil' nuff 'bout 6 - '   REGINALD'S REVENGE; on, here, Lord nose! I dunno whar you kin git a place in dese diggin's, chile." Poor Ralph's spirits sank at this information; he had not sought for a home during the day, but now he considered himself far enough from Mrs. Fenton to settle down in a safe harbor. An imposing and brilliantly illuminated mansion burst upon his sight; through a beautiful grove, as the lazy oxen rounded the corner and turned up a by-path. "Dare, you kin stay yander, chile, twel ter-mor- rer, annyhow-da'll take keer uv ye-po thing!" "I'm afraid to go there, uncle." "What fur, chile?"

The old servant looked at Ralph's ragged trousers, sorrowfully, and said," you's had a hard time in de worl' ain' you, chile?'? Ralph told his new friend something of his young trials, reserving the fact of his being a fugitive. "Dad drap 'er!" growled his sympathizing inter- locutor, "she'll pay fur it when de ole Harry gits 'er-fore de Lord! he'll make 'er smell fire 'n brim- stone-dat's de trufe!" But no assurance could induce Ralph to approach   the stately mansion; he had a childish horror for fine dwellings and aristocratic paraphernalia. He slept in uncle Jacob's cabin upon a clean pallet, spread by the old negro's kind-hearted help-meet, with a good, substantial supper for a bed-fellow, and went trudging on his way, with the earliest song of the morning birds, grateful for the good fortune that had followed him since his escape from Mrs. Fenton. Ralph's little heart was soft and gentle save when he remembered his stonysouled mistress: the gall of bitterness welled up, at the remembrance of her cruelties, and a deeper yearning for revenge strengthened within him. Many suns rose and rounded over his young head, and yet Ralph was homeless. He had not suffered from inanition, but his little feet were sore and blis- tered by long travel, and once he had been forced to sleep upon the limb of a tree, with his little body lashed to its great trunk to avoid the catastrophe of gravitating earthward during somnolence. Ralph was getting tired of a gipsey life. The sun was slowly sinking in the golden horizon, when the little wanderer came in sight of a hum- ble but neat-looking tenement, set down in a neat enclosure, and shaded by thick, breezy maples and running roses. It looked the very picture of con- tent and kindness, and Ralph's weary little feet turned longingly through the small gate, and ap- proached the plainly-attired matron, at the thresh- old.   120    REGINALD'S REVENGE; OR, "Please let me stay here to-night, ma'am? I've come a long way to-day, and I'm so tired " and tears stood in the pleading eyes upraised to hers. "Certainly, my child; come in, dear," and the good .woman took his little hard hand, and led him into fler cheerful home. Ralph's young heart went out to the kind matron at the first" tone of her voice; its gentle, soothing accents reminded him of his dead mother, and his pale lips quivered with emotion, as she smoothed his dark hair and encouraged him to feel easy in his strange quarters, "You are a tiny bit of a bairn to be wandering about all alone, my dear; where do you come from, and where are you going, my child?" "I come from London, with papa and mamma, ma'am, when I was 'most a baby; they's both dead now, though, and I'm tryin' to find a home, but no- body wants me! they say I'm too little to do much ; but I'm fourteen, and- can work mighty hard, too; I'm used to it."

"Don't cry, my dear; you are tired, poor child! no wonder! your little feet are all blistered and red with walking! Here, sit in this rocker and rest a bit, till I call Phoebe to bathe them, poor thing! "Thank'e ma'am, I aint tirfed one bit, now," and the poor boy straightened himself up and drew his old jacket-sleeve hastily across his wet eyes; -"I'm so glad 'cause I can stay here-1 wanted to the first minet I set my eyes on you, ma'am-you looked like my good mamma that's in heaven.

Little Ralph slept that night as he had not before since his mother's death, with a prayer of thankfulness upon his pale, placid lips, because the Lord had "led him in a way he knew not.'   CHAPTER V. --- ---the ungovernable will, * And study of revenge, immortal hate, And COuRAGE never to submit or yield. MLTON. ITTLE Ralph's Life-path was now smooth and peaceful. After the rough storm upon the deep waters of distress and desolation, he had been moored, by an unseen Hand, into a calm and secure haven. Ralph was grateful, and believed firmly in the existence of a God now, but the bitter waters of hate and revenge would rise in his soul-sormetimes, when he retrospected his past condition, and inun- date his better feelings. He had now time enough for study, and a kind helper in the amiable Mrs. Hartwell, so far as her capacity extended, and he progressed with sur- prising rapidity. Mr. Hartwell also assisted him when his daily labors were done and a cheerful winter fire crackled upon the clean hearth, and through the long summer evenings.  Ralph had won the hearts of the aged pair, and hired servant, by his cheerful industry and truthful, generous (128)   124    REGINALD 'S REVENGE; OR, nature. "What his hand found to do, he did it with his might," and nothing was left undone upon the premises, that his watchful eyes and willing hands could perceive and accomplish. Relieved from constant fear and oppression, his little lean form expanded and rounded, and his large black eyes sparkled and smiled with health and happiness over two plump and ruddy cheeks. It was universally conceded, by all who saw him in his new home, that Ralph Reginald was " a beautiful boy." Mr. Hartwell was not a rich man, but " well to do in the world '--respected for his veracity and inflexible probity, and loved by all his neighbors for his benevolence and -genuine piety. His house was the " preacher's home," when the itinerant minister filled an appointment at the little brown country church, hard by the honest farmer's humble but comfortable habitation, and Ralph had the bene- fit of their instructions and counsel, during their transient visits. His thirst for knowledge and his precocity interested them, and rendered him an object of peculiar favor with the travelling clergy. Ralph had attended the country-school two sessions, and astonished his tutor and fellow- students by his rapid advancement, when Mr. Browrwas appointed to the Roanoke Circuit by the Methodist Episcopal Conference, in the boy's sixteenth year. Mr. Brown's attention was soon arrested by the youth's talents and embryo greatness, and devised   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     125 a plan for his promotion, which was, to enter him at Chapel Hill College as a beneficiary. Ralph's heart palpitated with an accelerated movement at the prospect, and bright, golden visions of "much learning" flitted through his young, ambitious brain. Mr.-and Mrs. Hartwell acceded to the good man's proposal, for the boy's benefit, and reluc- tantly saw him depart with his Rev. benefactor. Ralph was duly installed as a member of the Institution, and well he repaid his friend's atten- tion and interest, by his steady application and unimpeachable conduct. Five years passed away with their many revolu- tions and changes, and the little ragged, pale orphan-boy, that begged with tearful eyes a night's lodging at Mrs. Hartwell's door, seven years- before, was a tall, robust, well-dressed and hand- some man, returning from Chapel Hill to the same roof that sheltered him in his young helplessness, with his blazing diploma in his broadcloth pocket I Verily, the YEARS write marvellous histories, and work wonderful transformations!-old Time sets- up kings, and pulls down empires and dominions! During his collegiate course Ralph had annually visited his proud foster-parents, and in his- nine- teenth year had delivered, by request of the coun- try aristocracy, an oration on the Fourth of July, under a temporary tent fitted up for the patriotic occasion, which so excited an old "Tip and Tyler"   126    REGINALD'S REVENGE ; OR, politician of the legal profession by its power and brilliancy, that he enthusiastically grasped the young orator'shand, and. proffered his services as a stepping-stone to membership among the legal fraternity. Truly, "a man's gift- maketh room for him? and bringeth him before great men." Ralph now resolved to qualify himself for the pro- fession, and forthwith entered upon the study of law, with the kind old walking-encyclopedia for a master. He accepted the situation of teacher, in the old school-house where he had formerly been a pupil, and prosecuted his studies with a zeal and whole- heartedness characteristic of the oppressed orphan- boy poring over his greasy primer in Mrs. Fenton's gloomy garret. At twenty-three he was duly qualified, and ad- mitted to the bar, and had stood up in the hall of justice, in the little shire-town of W , before his admiring master, and successfully defended his first client. Ralph's progress was steadily "upward and onward." But a cloud came over his sky, in the death of his loved and loving foster-father, when the sun of prosperity shone brightest upon the morning of his manhood; and ere he had attained his twenty- fifth year, Ralph had shed tears of sorrow and affection upon two graves in the little dim church- yard I Mr. and Mrs. Hartwell, side by side, " slept well," and the monument that Ralph erected to their memory, told the living who "viewed the ground," that " they died in the Lord."   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     127 Mr. Hartwell bequeathed his little worldly possessions to his foster-son, and with his loneli- ness came a yearning for change of scene to the young man's heart, He converted his little prop- erty into gold, and with eleven ,hundred dollars in his purse, Ralph mounted his own horse, and looked a last farewell upon- the little cottage, through the maples, where his most prosperous hours had been passed, now no longer coveted, since they; who had made it "home" to his orphan heart would nevermore sit and smile beneath its moss- grown roof! Ralph retraced the road he had traversed ten years before, and gathering a leaf from the old tree in which he had slept, a friendless, horieless little boy, the strong-hearted, gifted man laid it carefully in his memorandum-book, as a memento of early years. On the eve of the third day his spirited steed bore him in view of the elegant mansion he had refused to enter, long ago, through fear of its aris- tocratic surroundings, and Ralph looked eagerly about him for his old friend and host-uncle Jacob. He had resolved to obtain an interview, if he were yet in the land of the living. A wide field stretched away between him and the mansion, over which broad, level area the young spring corn gently bent in the light evening breeze, and our traveller's black eyes scrutinized every sa- ble face that bent over the hilling hoe, and followed the cutting plow ; but Ralph's search was fruitless.   128    REGINALD S REVENGE; OR,     ' -The laborers amused themselves with a song as they finished their day's tasks,-and the clear, rich voices that rolled up to the blue heavens, interested and saddened him by their plaintive cadences and long-drawn syllables.

A voice hitherto unheard chimed in here: "Hang up de shovel an' de hoe-o-o, An' han'- down de fiddle an' de b-o-w 1"-- and Ralph turned in the direction of the well- known souhd with brightening eyes. Uncle Jacob had just heaved in sight from behind the fence-cor- ner, his hoe doing execution among the clods as he marched, half bent, with both sinewy arms bare to the shoulders, and slouched hat crushed down in most friendly-proximity to his flat nose. .His ten- dency was towards our traveller, and Ralph awaited his coming up. "Hallo, there, uncle!" The old negro dropped his hoe and straightened up. "Sarvent, maister ;" he doffed his hat and pulled his forelock respectfully. ' Tell -me who occupies that fine mansion, uncle?" "'Squire Htamlin, sah-I b'longs ter 'im, sah." Ralph started at the name-he had not heard it ten years before.

He recognized his old mistress at a glance, and e- old-time surge of bitterness rolled over his heart he looked; it had even acquired strength and !udmei'by time and absence. Ralph was a strictly oral and upright man, in the world's estimation, (132)   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     133 but he was yet unregenerated, and had not learned to forgive " even seventy times seven." He was the possessor of a soul that could neither love nor hate lightly; there was no vascillating, no luke-warm- ness in his nature; he was solid as a marble statue in his partialities and prejudices-either a lamb or a lion. Ralph hated Mrs. Fenton as deeply as he:had loved his gentle foster-mother ; it had " grown-with his growth and strengthened with his strength "- become radical in his nature, and he was self- pledged to revenge his past wrongs, if human inge- nuity could accomplish it, even at -any personal sacrifice I He would not reflect that "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord." He compressed his firm lips with burning ani- mosity, as he returned her smiling salutation to the handsome and elegant stranger, even while a seem- ing of blandness overspread his calm face.

The promise of the tender bud was more than real- ized in the fresh, expanded flower. A robe of cloud-like gauze floated in fleecy folds around her small, symmetrical form; the round, plump arms and alabaster neck were bare, and glit. tering with gold and gems; long glossy ringlets of raven hue fluttered over her soft, waxen shoulders ,      .   ,134    REGINALD'S REVENGE; OR, and round, innocent face, that looked like a wild rose-leaf thrown upon snow, and a line of tapering crimson iarked thg small, luscious mouth.

Nelhe had ceased to remember the poor boy of ten long years ago. He watched her surreptitiously, and caught her thoughtful eyes occasionally turned askance upon his physiognomy. She blushed at the repeated, de- tection, and eluded his vigilance thereafter; but Ralph saw she was an attentive listener to his every word. Ralph enjoyed his ruse hugely, and exerted all his powers of eloquence and erudition to arrest and entertain her. "A native of North Carolina, eh?" inquired the  -Squire, during his tdte-d-tdte with the stranger guest.           - "No, sir, only a resident of some years."

"Fine place, the old North State, I'm told," con- tinued the 'Squire.

Circumstances resulting from her cruelty and oppression, invested him' with an interest that convened a larger assembly than he would other- wise have attracted; thus, "out of evil came forth good."

From the hour of his exit from Mrs. Fenton's mansion into the wide world, homeless and friendless, he had acted upon the principle that "in the lexicon of youth there's no such word as fail, and quid homo fecit faciat. He had never shrank from difficulties, nor succumbed to opposi- tion. Like the brave Corsican general, he had ever thundered to the troops of thoughts and feelings that followed him in his life-tramp:- "Fellow soldiers, here is starvation; yonder is the enemy; beyond him, plenty -MARCH "    And Ralph /ead: marched,' straight forward, without flinching; cutting through the enemy, tearing down the red flag of every foe,-and came off victorious with' only one wound, and that he had sworn to revenge! Reader, Ralph Reginald was not an embodiment of every virtue and perfection-- he was only a man. Burst after burst of applause followed our hero through his brilliant and stirring address, in which the old 'Squire's gold-headed cane aided vigorously' and enthusiastically: but Ralph's richest reward was in Nellie's beaming face and moist eyes. ,The. sweet girl's speakingscountenance inspired him ;as   "8    REGINALD'S REVENGE; 0:, the roll of the battle-drum and martial music inspirit the tramping warriors, and lightning-flashes of poetic fancy leaped from his eloquent lips, and thunder-peals of thought and feeling rolled up from his profound and well-stored mind, and were wafted out to the absorbed crowd with an elocution that doubled their intrinsic beauty and power, till a deafening "hurra" burst spontaneously from the audience, and drowned the orator's voice, while Nellie's small, cherry' mouth was spread with sparkling animation, as she concealed her face to screen enthusiastic tears!

Nellie's dark eyes looked modestly and wistfully into his, at the close of the lecture, but though Ralph recognized her with a soul-full smile and graceful inclination, he stood aloof-she was too near her depised mother! Nellie passed a sleepless night, reviewing by-gone events, and those of the evening, especially, and wondering if he would not come to-morrow; but day after day rolled on, and month after month, and yet she looked in vain. Her sweet, sad face grew paler and thinner, while Ralph's was flushed with success and prosperity, as he was borne over the sea of life upon the rose-tinted waves of popularity.  ^        4   CHAPTE,! VIII. "On her lightning-wing I aps vivid thought, And dark- remorse rolls iumblingly along " A FEW days subsequent to his brilliant triumph before his old mortifiei mistress, "Ralph Reg- inald, Attorney-at-Law," stood out in bold relief upon a handsome office on the great thoroughfare. Ralph had taken lodgings at the first hotel in the city, and commenced his brofessional career with a flourish becoming his late' victory. His fine talents and lofty mien were a passport to universal favor. and the highest houses were gladly thrown open to receive him. Mrs. Farley, she whom Mrs. Fenton had rivalled in the contribution of one hundred dollars to a foreign mission, was among the first to court his friendship and favor, and poor Nellie's paleness was in a great degree attributable to his occasional appearance in society with gentle, blue-eyed, lily- bud Fanny Farley! Nellie frequently met Ralph in scenes of gayety and fashion, but though he was invariably smiling and sociable in her mother's absence, and sometimes familiarly referred to le r former capacity as teacher, (160)   THE ROD ANsD IE:P::OOF.    151 yet he had not accepted her own and Mr. Fenton's invitations to visit the family mansion, nor betray- ed one symptom   of willingness to forgive and become reconciled with Mrs. Fenton; and the poor girl acutely suffered in secret for her mnother's sins. Mrs. Fenton's pride rose with several ineffectual attempts to conciliate the popular favorite, and tlhereafter the two passed and re-passed, in" society, with equal coldness and hauteur on either side. Their enmity was a well-known fact in the comrn- munity, oind a subject of frequent discussion in private circles. During Ralphlls residence under the Fenton roof Mr. Fenton had been involved in a lawsuit with a relative of his wife, who had been defeated through indifferent counsel and bribed witnesses, and ren- dered poorer in consequence. Ralph well remem- bered the words of exultation that rang through the mansion at the result of the suit, but his young mind could not comprehend " the weightier matters of the law" then. Mr. Winton, the plaintiff, had lived in poverty since that judicial decision, and avowed enmity with his relatives, the Fentons. He gloried in Ralph's expose of his mean mistress, and grasped at every circumstance that could weigh against her. He wa's present at RalpAlhs first lecture, and remularly .attvended the p courtfroom were thQ Attorney's .eloquence ,and legal- punning had, re- peatedly vanquished his opponent; and Mr. Win- ton conceived the, idea of reviving the old suit,   52    REGINALD'S REVENGE; OR, and committing his cause to Ralph's ability and vengeance. He visited the young lawyer at his office, stated the 'case- and asked advice, anticipating his hearty cooperation, from a knowledge of Ralplh's hatred for Mrs. Fenton. Ralph, finding that a verdict had been rendered for the defendant, and a new trial granted to the plaintiff, who thereupon immediately ordered his .suit to be dismissed, from pecuniary inability to con- tinue it, which the court had permitted,--and no judgmei t having been entered, on the verdict, so as to bar any future action, therefore no bar existed ; he took the matter-in -his own hands, merely stipu: lating, as his fee in case of success, the Fenton mansion. Ah! the thorn of animosity rankled deep in his unregenerate heart ! In six months Efter Ralph's appearance in Al- verton, as an Attorney, Mrs. Fenton 'was reduced from affluence to comparative poverty, through the agency of the ragged pauper-boy whom" she had so cruelly treated: in -by-gone days, and he was the possessor of the mansion in whose garret he had dragged out more than four miserable years! thus verifying the Word: "He that covereth his sins shall not -prosper.' Mr. Fenton was now in as " evil a case" as Ralph had ever bemoaned : .he had a shrew for a wife, and no wealth as a compensation! but his inherent ; strength now shone forth for his idolized dauglh- ter's sake. Weak in prosperity, he was strongand    THE ROD AND REPROOF.          153 brave in adversity, when a loved and helpless one leaned upon him for support and protection. He purchased a small but neat dwelling, in a retired part of the city, and obtained the situation of clerk in.the store that had formerly borne his name in gilt letters above the door. Bob, who had been reared as a gentleman at large, without employment or profession, quitted the town in a rage that did infinite credit to his mother's violent temper, and took up a line of march to the shout of " Westward ho ! " to try his fortune towards the setting sun. He was too- proud to descend to the drudgery of work in his native towndI Nellie, who possessed her father's spirit, could not remain inactive in times that required exertion- for a support. She secretly applied for and obtain- ed a small class in music, and entered upon the du- ties of teacher with a cheerfulness that encouraged her father's heart, while Mrs. Fenton shed tears of remorse and shame over her degradation.   She could not shut out from her guilty conscience the words: " I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay-tree: yet he passed away,--I sought him but he could not be found." Mrs. Fenton wept tears of anger and hate, mingled with remorse: memory was active during her daily avocations, and poverty was teaching her penitence. . Ralph and his old mistress had now changed places ; he had hurled her down into the vale, while he stood upon the mountain-top, watching her from 7**   154    BEGINALD S REVENGE; ORt his proud height ;; yet Ralph-was -no6 happier than when he -had been her servant-bov. He was now i *  -    *   -v lord of' her once home, anid nister of his -old friend anfdf comforter, aunt Dinah,t whomln he had long ago promised to "buay with the first hundred dollars he made." Auiint Dinah wept tears of joy and sorrow, when Ralph took possession of his new home; she was more forgiving than her young master, and shed tears of sadness for the fate of her old mistress, while our hero compressed his lips closely, and locked up his bwn- feelings with the key of obmu- tescence; -yet away down in his soul was groaning the hoarse sound that had followed him ten long struggling years--"REVENGE! REVENGE!" But aunt Dinah did not grieve long over the change-it was not in human nature ; she no longer got a head-ache from a hasty and irritable thump, and was mistress of the key-basket, yet she visited the fallen Fe tons frequently, without " let or hin- drance," to offer consolation in her peculiar way. Nellie greeted her eagerly, for Ralph was the old negro's theme, and the loving girl never wearied of hearing his praise. She knew he possessed a noble heart, and his hard lot in boyhood palliated his unforgivihg spirit, in the fair maiden's mind. She loved him, in spite of his hardness, and prayed daily, nay, hourly-for Ralph was ever in her thoughts-that God would " take away his heart of stone, and give him one of flesh," thfat could forgive and forget her mother's wrongs to the little helpless I   THE BROD AND REPROOF.     1 orphan-boy of long ago ,;but the heavens were brass, and no signs of a " elting mood" appeared in Ralph's demeanor, whenever they casually met. The courted and flattered man mingled much in the gay world, where Nelhe was no longer seen, and danced and smiled, the gayest of the gay, till rumor whispered that'Miss Fanny Farley would soon become the bride of the handsome and elo- quent lawyer. Nellie caught- the floating sound, and her whitening face betrayed the inner stuggle, but no word of comment escaped her lips. Ralph was poring over the morning paper, in his bachelor home,-both patent-leather boots perched upon the glittering fender, and a fragrant Havana protruding from his finely cut lips, while aunt Dinah rattled the china upon the breakfast-table, as she cleared the board. Suddenly his fine face flushed to a crimson hue, his black eyes grew larger and brighter, and a radiant smile lighted up his handsome countenance. All throughll the day it was bruited throughout the town that " lawyer Reginald had fallen heir to the princely fortune of his grandfather, the earl of Montrose, who had recently deceased, and beqeathed his vast possessions to his only daughter; or her de- scendents, if she-Mrs. Mary Reginald-who had emigrated to America twenty-one years ago, was no longer living." This was what had so startled our hero. The advertisement had been copied from a London jour- nal,.througholt the States, at the request of the   156 .  j REGINALD S REVENGE; OR, repentant and dying earl, and had come under the notice of ithe Alverton editors late the preceding evening. ,l Ralph -as now the "lion of the tribe" in the town where he had once been a suffering, snubbed "pauper,'t and ambitious, managing mammas now vied with each other in doing honor to- the grand- son of an English earl! Our hero bore his great good fortune with calm dignity, and soon the city papers announced his de- parture for Europe, in an editorial long and loud enough to satisfy the vainest of the vain. Mrs, Fenton pressed her lips closely, as she. caught the flying news, and a paleness overspread her cold face; conscience stung her for her injus- tice to the poor 'orphan boy, and robbed her of peace in watching his prosperity. Had she been humane, and a mother to the motherless, what honor would now be reflected upon her, in lieu of poverty, and reproach, and a galling memory. Her daugh- ter might have been the wife of the grandson of an English noble-for Mrs. Fenton had early de- te6ted their young partiality, and feared it-instead of toiling for her daily bread, and wasting her youth and beauty in neglect and obscurity. She knew Nellie's love for Ralph-she had seen it in her brightening eye, when they met, or his praise was sung by the popular voice, and in her colorless face, when the rumor of his marriage with Fanny Fenton reached her ear.

She suffered from the knowledge that her gentle, uncomplaining daughter was reduced to labor, and slowly wasting away with secret sorrow, for her sins! She now realized what Ralph felt when she con- sidered him destitute of sensibility and unworthy of education, simply because of his poverty; she was forsaken by-her old associates, and coolly passed by those who had once courted her society, because of her station ; and Mrs. Fenton keenly felt her in- justice to the poor, friendless boy, now far her su- perior in wealth, talents and station. Mrs. Fenton found there was retributive justice in the earth, when Nellie's waxen cheek premonished her of con- sumption; and Bob's complaining letters were an occasional thorn in her remorseful memory.   CHAPTER IX.

Four years had elapsed since they last ported, and Mr. Brown, though apprised by the public journals.'of his old favorite's: good fortune, was utterly igno- rant of his locality,-until his arrival in Alverton. He soon, learned Ralph's whole history, and , sor- rowed for the vindictive spirit clearly evidenced by recent transactions. The -good man could not regard Ralph's conduct as the world viewed it-he did not justify his measures upon the ground of past oppression. ' Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us," was written with the Spirit's stylus upon his holy heart. Mr. Fenton's mother was a member of the Meth- odist church, and he had ever retained a partial- ity for that denomination, but was led off by his proud wife to the "high church," where she had attended from childhood. But with her reduced circumstances, and the desertion of her aristocratic friends, Mrs, Fenton had consented to attend a plainer sanctuary, for a triple reason: firstly, there was no pew-rent, which she could ill afford; secondly, she could no longer compete, in costly- and fashionable apparel, with her old associates; and thirdly and lastly, her humble cottage was distant from the " high church " and in the vicinity of the " low," the " shouting sect," so denominated   BREGINALD S REVENGE ; OR, -    by lthe 1' upper-tendom."  Her plain Methodist -nneighboirs, :were considerate and :kind, and Mrs. FenItonfound more sympathy among the humble in heat, than in the lofty-headed and wealthy: they I were summer friends, who had flown with the first winter-breath of adversity.  Mrs. Fenton had leasrned ,a; sad- and long lesson, since her downfall, that she had never conned in the sunshine of wealth and high social position. Mr Briown soon found his way into her- cottage from desi:refor apersonal acquaintance with Ralph's old mistress, and Istartled and interested them with - a revelation-Ne llie, particularly--of the orphan boy s:life in, North Carolina; and ere Ralph's return,-the good pastor had enrolled the names of : the three Fentons upon his book of churchl-mem- bership. Sorrow and remorse brought her to the foot of the cross, and Mrs. Fenton's pride and evil tempervere: :buried in humility, and Christian pa- tifence: ad forbearance. She confessed with the Psalmist: "iI ki   ,Q:O Lord, that thy judgments :b-  ~ -are true, and tha iTin wisdom thou hast afflicted ; me.s     er -  --t -  Ralph's ;heart smote hIim, as his eyes first fell tupon= her thfin, sorrowfulI:face, but a swift flight of - - -thought to other years stirred up the old bitter- i-ness:within him; he' kne-w her to be a hypocrite :*:  of: - deepest dye,  and his momentary softness fled  -   :        iappearance      runghis heart: 'how ;- egOm: - ilooming, transcendently beauti- (;':/..- .. ... b, -  -  '  .' ,l   , ,   , - , ,   ,-q  ,:., *  . - , - t~~~~~~~~~~~   16-1   THE ROD AND REPROOF.   ful girl he had met at 'Squire Hamlin's!

He had met her but rarely since, and then her thick veil hid her countenance, as she passed him hastily and sought to avoid con- tact. Mr. Brown's eloquent and impressive discourse, from the text---'If ye forgive not men their tres- passes, neither will your Father in Heaven forgive your trespasses," did not one whit relieve his aien- tal excitement. Ralph had never been so " cut to- the- heart"? by a Sunday sermon as the one his old benefactor now poured into his open) ear, and sim- ply because he had never sat under the sound of - a minister's voice who spoke directly at and for him. It " struck home," and our hero flinched under the hammer of Divine truth as he had never quailed in his life before. .. -Mr. Brown had repudiated his prepared sermion for the day, when- Ralph entered the sanctuary, and preached from impulse and- motive, forhi-s especial appropriation .and benefit,and:: his words " accomplished that wh    ereunto they were sent," fo,  162    REGINALD'S REVENGE ; OR, "-a;: e I easoned of righteousness, temperance, and a judgment to come, Felix trembled." 1 Mr*.

You drew me here after ten years' absence, but the devil took possession of me, when I met your mother, and saw the depth of her hypocrisy! Forgive me-for this once, let me speak plainly, and henceforth we will vaill the past. She made me hate her as deeply as I loved you, Nellie, and my evil genius triumphed over the good angel!

She could not say more, for a pair of manly and passionate lips shut her small mouth. Yes, reader, the poor ragged serving-boy of ten years before, held in his manly and- patrician arms -the child of his once proud and heartless and scornful mistress, and the world would have said, respecting him, had it witnessed the act, "What condescension!"

We are quits; neither of us should throw stones, for we both occupy glass houses 1' "1 No fear--' old things have passed away, and all things become new' in .her nature. She would hit- me in casting at you, Ralph!" He put back the jetty curls from her white fore- head, and sat in silent observation, till Nellie's cheeks grew rosier, and the happy sparkles of her dark eyes were hid under the modest lids. "You look like the: little witch of other days, Nellie, with your bloom and brightness. I robbed you of them, and it is in my power to make restitution! -My wife shall forget the wrongs of her secret lover, in her husband's devotion." But Nellie's happiness had already swallowed up the memory of the past, so far as feeling was concerned; the horizon of her sky wore a brighter blue and sunnier sheen, for having been obscured by a sable cloud of sorrow. Ralph anxiously awaited Mrs. Fenton's coming, and the low knock that heralded her return called up a smile of anticipation to his soul-lit face.   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     176 There was no longer dread to subdue, or pride to conquer, in him; his heart had been softened by his confession to Nellie, and her sweet acknowledg- ment of reciprocated love. Mrs. Fenton's feet became rooted to the spot, and her thin face grew paler, as her eyes fell upon her old enemy, seated with so much complacency under the humble roof to which he had maliciously driven her, from the proud home of her youth.  His appearance there filled her with apprehensions of further trouble and misfortune. She considered him her implacable enemy-one that was past redemption in his natural state, and he had mani- fested no symptoms of " repentance towards God." Ralph advanced towards her, soberly, both- hands crossed behind him. "Mrs. Fenton, I need not recapitulate the story of by-gone years: it is printed by the great press of memory upon the leaf of your conscience. Shall it be stereotyped by continued enmity, and handed down, through the years that may come, to tell how human hearts can hate and revenge? or, shall we blot it from the book of life, and write in its stead, with the fluid of friendship, "Forgive and Forget?"-he extended his hand. Nellie trembled and smiled as she awaited the result unseen. Mrs. Fenton burst into tears as she laid her hand, now, hardened by toil, upon his soft palm, once lean ,nd begrimmed by daily labor for her. She had never before clasped that hand, though i  1 *     K    176    REGINALD'S REVENGE; OR it had lived, four' years under her roof, simply because it was that of a "poor pauper!"--and yet that hand she once disdained to touch had hurled her from her proud height, and now honored her by its contact in proffered friendship!

Then I was 'proud and lifted up,--but now I have learned to sympathize with the poor and friendless. 'Experience teaches a dear school,'-Ralph, but it learns us wisdom.

At this point our heroine glided in, and Mrs. Fenton responded in a voice tremulous with glad emotion: "Take her, Ralph, and a mother's blessings on you both!" And Ralph did take her in his manly, circling arms, while Mrs. Fenton returned, thanking God that "His mercy endureth forever."   CHAPTER X., "With God all things are possible." OUR hero bore his blooming affianced to his brilliant mansion, and there, in the home of her childhood, was united to her, indissolubly, by his old, rejoicing benefactor, Mr. Brown; while aunt Dinah mounted a chair in the outer hall, and witnessed the marriage ceremony over the glitter- ing heads of the grand assembly, and subsequently remarked to a fellow-servant, with a joyful shake of her white turbaned head: "I node it-bless de Lordl I axed Mars Brown an Miss Nellie (God bless 'er puty face!) ter he'p me pray fur 'im, an' we's beat de old boy at las' -- he can' do nuthin' w'eii de Lord's 'ginst 'im-dat's what!" Bob was called back from the far West, and established in business by his brother-in-law, as a reparation for his wrong.

He soon married, and settled down in sober, circumspect (178)   THE ROD AND REPROOF.     179 life, loving Ralph with a brother's heart, and proud of his sister's alliance. Uncle Jacob made it a point to visit Alverton soon after our hero's nuptials, for the express pur- pose of congratulating "de little ragged boy" of long ago, and "de putiest little leddy he ever set eyes on!" Ralph led his laughing young wife out to the old negro with a mirthful smile. "Sarvant, marster-mistis. I's mity glad ter see ye bofe 'gin--'fore de Lord! cum purpose ter wish ye much joy an' long life, an'--he a! he a!-" "And a chew of tobacco for you at all times, uncle Jacob."

Mr. and Mrs. Fenton passed the remainder of their days in the house of their loved and affec- tionate son-in-law, and Mrs. Fenton never entered the old garret, or looked upon a pale, ragged boy, without tears for the one, and deeds of kindness for the other!

Aunt Patty, who had called down the wrath of her brave man Otto by her injudicious remark, squinted her white eyes in silence, and * chuckled inwardly, as she watched him flourishing the fire-poker in anticipated combat with the rebels; but fearful lest the menaces of the black warrior towards the invisible foe, should be directed to her unlucky self, she concluded that "discretion was the better part of valor ;" so bethinking her of the word " mum," she pulled her home-spun cap over her depreciated nose, and sat nodding over the fire, leaving her good man to commit depredations upon the chairs, stands and bed-posts, and everything his war-like enthusiasm construed into a desperate red- coat. Beneath the same roof-for those who have vis- ited the New England States are aware that, unlike the Southern style, one roof shelters " parlor and kitchen  and  all"-where patriotic ardor was effervescing so gloriously, to the demolition of the hard-headed enemies that impeded the progress of bold Otto's grand march, in a small but pretty apartment, on a low couch, lay a fair young girl. She was beautiful even in her misery. A casual observer would have thought the- light breath had escaped forever from  those exquisitely chiselled lips, and her mother, her widowed mother, who sat near her, seeking consolation from the holy word  of inspiration, ofttimes paused in her heavenly re- search for some slight indication of vitality, which was evinced by a soft undulation of the fleecy folds  186      ITALIA ALMAN;. OR, of the white robe that lay upon her delicate bo. som. The long dark lashes that fringed her closed eyelids, pencilled her child-like cheek, so pale and fair, and the golden brown hair, pushed carelessly back from the blue-veined and transparent brow, lay in shining rings upon the snowy pillow, from between which a white, unfolding rose-bud, with a tiny tear-drop trembling in its pure heart, in the golden light of the night lamp, peeped forth, as if to vie in 'whiteness with the dimpled hand that nes- tled beneath the young cheek of the sorrowing one. On-that same sweet night in June, a little group was gathered in a vine-latticed porch near a silver lake that flashed and sparkled in lthe calm moon- light. Far away, through a deep beautiful grove of leafy trees that waved silently in the soft breeze, looked down upon the little circle the pretty white cottage of widow Alman, from its mountain site. "Poor Italia!" said the 'mother, " she is so sen- sitive and delicate, I' fear she will break her heart with grief if you persist in you present purpose, Harry.

Obey the mandate of your country's call, and when peace is restored to our beloved land, I shall glory in the consciousness that one in whose veins courses my own life-tide, stood boldly forth :in her defence. I only regret that these palsied limbs and feeble frame are incapacitated from bearing you company." "Brother! dear brother!" cried the fair girl, that leaned almost lifeless upon her mother's bo- somn; and starting up with a sudden effort, she twined her white arms about his neck--"I should be unworthy of you," she said, " if my heart could falter at your decision. Our father's spirit is not confined to his own bosom; much as I love you, my brother, that love is not paramount to that whic-h I cherish for our own struggling America.

Scarce had his foot crossed the threshold, when the soft arms of the fair young dreamer upon the low couch were twined around him, and a tear wet his cheek as he pressed her trembling lips. "What! in tears my own Italia?" he exclaimed, forcing a smile to dispel her own sadness-"Does your patriotic nature waver as the trial-time ap- proaches? Does your firm heart quail before the apparitions of fancyv's conjuration, and would you speak one word to deter me from flying to the defence of our own native land?" "No, Harry, no," replied she, striving to repress her tears--"I would not place so dark a stain upon your untarnished name and nature. My better judgment commends your noble sacrifice, but my heart is weak and fearful, and-it is so hard to part under such auspices."      a ' Hope, dearest, hope for the best; always look to the bright sitde of every object; the sweetest joys of life are often clouded by unnecessary fears :   THE CHLD HEIRESS.     189 why should we always anticipate evil, when the wisdom of the God of armies is over all his creatures?  Think of the victories our gallant commander has achieved heretofore, through the interposition of that Providence that always favors the cause of justice. Oh! how my young spirit has yearned to take up arms in array against the cruel oppressors of my struggling country; and now that I have escaped, like a young bird from the nest-home of its mother-now that I have transcended the line of minority, should I not fly to the ranks of America's defenders? I should be unworthy of this dear hand, could I shrink from this duty. T'he invisible Power that has crowned with unfading laurels the glorious brow of the noble Washington may shield me from the death- darts of the mighty foe, and when the cannon's rattle shall be heard no more in our land, and the war-sound shall die away on the ocean of peace, how  sweet will be the reflection that I contributed my mite to calm its roaring surges!" "True, dear Harry, but should you fall-" she buried her white face in his bosom, incapable of proceeding. "And should the probability of death in so glo- rious a cause intimidate me, Italia? would not the dying words of the noble McDonald reconcile you to such a te, should it be mine?  Oh! I would rather die like a Warren or a Montgomery, at the post of duty, than live to loathe myself for the spirit of a Galloway or an Allen."   190      ITALIA AOLMAN; OR, "Or a Godfrey Wayland!" said the fair girl, her proud lip curling with scorn-" he whose fate has so long been enveloped in mystery; whose only consolation is that he fell in a righteous cause." "And what of him," asked her companion, a dark shade settling upon his brow,-" what of my rival, for whom I thought the grave had extinguished my enmity?"'  "He lives, Harry; not to shine forth with bril- liance in the annals of history, but an enemy to his country! a dark blot upon the pc ges of a nation's gloryy!" "How know you that, Italia?" said Harry Ver- ner, starting wildly with an expression of horror and contempt depicted on every lineament of his fine countenance--' how came you possessed of such intelligence?" "A billet, left by an unknown hand in yonder bower, where the moonlight's gold falls so sweetly, bathing its rosy clusters in dewy radiance, revealed this sad secret. I forebore to communicate to his poor mother intelligence that would rend the al- most sundered chain that binds her to existence.

But I comprehend it all, Italia; his ambitious and mercenary spirit antici- pates the subjugation of the colonies, from the gloom that has long overshadowed our land, aris- ing from defeat at the South, and disappointment at the North ; and, perhaps, instigated by the libe- rally rewarded treason- of the despicable Arnold, he has deserted the American camp when she most needed succor from her children, and fled to the ranks of the enemy, as the only means of safety.

This tdte a tWte of the young lovers, was not confined exclusively to themselves, for as the manly tones of Harry, and the silver music of Italia's voice floated upon the hushed air, they passed through the little key-hole into the big ear of Otto. "Gosh-a-mity!" said he, sneaking back to the kitchen-hearth, from the application of his expanded auditory to the tiny aperture-"Gosh-a-mity ole sleepy bed, mars Harry, the bravest feller extinct, dat he- is!

Aunt Patty, who did not altogether relish the music of the beaten air in her immediate vicinity, crept quietly away to, bed, mumbling aw- fully between her compressed lips as she ensconced herself therein, leaving Otto to sentinel the conven- ient key-hole.

"Die enemy to thy country, and base presumer upon the hand of Italia Alman," cried he, directing his glittering weapon with a mighty thrust at the loyalist. A tall Briton warded off the death-blow, by elevating the polished steel with the point of his bayonet, and disarmed and powerless, the young adherent to America's cause stood fearlessly before the exulting sycophant for royal favor. "Die, thou base brat, who hast dared to raise thy puny arm against his majesty's loyal subject, and die with the assurance that she whose name you have uttered, shall kneel to me for mercy for slighting the love that your foolish tongue taught her to reject-" and with a demoniacal heartless- ness, the bright steel of Godfrey Wayland entered the bosom of Harry Verner!

"Lie there, young one, and be forgot by her who shall soon cower beneath the glance of him whom she thinks-to scorn with impunity!" Raising his sword he would have plunged it a second time, with savage barbarity into the still bosom of his prostrate rival, but a shot unnerved his arm and he sank beside his foe.

The cries of the widows and orphans went up with one voice to the throne of the Eternal One, calling for vengeance upon the heads of the savage foe. Italia Alman sat gazing out upon a bright sum- mer sky, and the moonlight's gold falling upon her attenuated form, revealed but a wreck of her former self. The cool winds stealing through the curtained window, lifted the bright curls from her white forehead, and soothed. her throbbing heart with their delicious breath. The sweetness of a starry night, the little lake shining far away, and the tranquil loveliness of Nature's blooming face, lulled her to a dreamy listlessness, and her low, sweet voice rose in song upon the hushed air, startling her mother-by its long-silent melody. She sang, and listening nature caught the low, heart-sound, and bore it on its balmy wing to lend new music to its own --sweet sighs. (197)   19)8       'ITALIA ALMAN; OR, SONG.

The deep   sobs of the unhappy mother were heard in the stillness as the last notes floated upon the air--the long, dark fringes slept upon the white cheek of the mournful warbler, and none saw the savage face that peered in through the open case- ment.  A low knock aroused the weeping mother, and dashing away the .heart-dew from     her heavy eyes, she arose to admit the visitors.

A fourth fleet-footed steed dashed furiously in pursuit of the daring foe. On, on sped old Otto to the rescue of his darling black-eyed mistress, his white head bathed in moonlight, and his- eyes start- ing from their sockets with over-strained anxiety, arousing with his hoarse denunciations of the "sneakin' varmints," the startled inhabitants of the quiet mountain. On, on he flew, unequiped and hatless, over hills and through valleys; along the  mountain-path and down the steep declivity; on, on dashed the fiery steed, each moment widening with incredible rapidity the distance between the warm-hearted guinea and his vine-cot home. fMin- utes, hours, passed unheeded; trees, walls, houses, receded in the distance. Old Otto had but one thought, and on, on he urged the snorting steed that seemed to partake the burning zeal of his faithful rider. Old Otto thought not once that he might be pursuing but his own shadow-that the flight of the -fugitives might have tended towards a different compass, and away, away he dashed along the white plain to the rescue of the helpless cap- tive. Aroused by the clatter of flying hoofs, and the familiar voice of the enraged pursuer, the hardy   200      ITALIA .ALMAN; OR, sons of the mountain rushed to the cottage of widow Alman, and learned from the excited Patty the story of the abduction of the helpless maiden.

"Won't I make 'ema howl?" cried the fiery Jo, shaking his brawny arm fiercely, and gazing ad- niringly upon its firm proportions.

"To arms!" cried the deep voice of Col. Verner, above' the din of the angry yeoman; "to arms, freemen! Immortal honors to the rescuers of Italia Alman!" A wild shout swelled from the lips of the indig- nant group, as the heavy tramp of retreating feet echoed along the mountain side. A proud steed dashed from the nearest farm-yard, bearing down the hill the sturdy form of Jo Wilkins. . . ,  . *   THE CHLD HEIRESS.     201 "Got your smellin' bottle?" yelled the impatient youth, whirling up to the waiting Bob Winters. "All right!" replied Bob, pointing significantly to two formidable looking weapons that protruded from his breast-pockets ; " going to make 'em smelt -eh, Jo?" "Jehu! won't I make the stopper fly?" said the chafing Jo, bringing his riding-whip to a level with one eye- as an illustration of the principle upon which he should operate, by way of accomplishing that. Four hardy yeomen bore down the quiet road that had an hour previous resounded to the tramp- of the flying foe, and Otto's pursuing steed. "Let's divide," said one of the little party, ar- riving at the junction of two roads; and plunging forward, they separated, two and two, Bob and Jo following hard in the wake of the faithful old negro. "If Harry Verner was here, wouldn't he make em swing?" said Jo, swelling with wrath, and posting on beside his companion. "Poor Hal has fought his last battle,' answered Bob, with a mysterious air and tone. "Dew tell!" exclaimed Joe, his great blue eyes growing bigger with interest and curiosity; " think so?" he added, as Bob exhibited no symptoms of being communicative. "Joe,". said his companion, at length, looking earnestly in the youth's honest face; " can you keep a secret?' 9* o     ,              .   202      ITALIA ALMA N; OR, "Blamed if I can't! jest try me."  a"You know the apple-cuttin' last night?" com- menced Bob, laying one hand on the pommel of Joe's saddle, and jogging on as fast as they deemed it prudent for their noble steeds, under the circum- stances. Joe nodded assent. . "Well, I escorted my girl home, and then took the shortest cut to father's, which, you know, runs by Polly White's-the vile creature! Twas past two o'clock when I mounted the hill ; but the voice of a man, which struck me as being familiar, in- clined me to draw near the hut, and hang me for a traitor if it wasn't Godfrey Wayland's!" "Snakes! wh-e-e-w!" exclaimed Joe, with a pro- longed whistle of astonishment; "thought Way- land was dead!" "Dead!" echoed Bob; " the devil's got work for him yet, and can spare him awhile from his ket- tle. I learned from his confab with the vile woman, that he had gone over to the British."

"Cousin Godfrey never come back no more " exclaimed the little girl, widening her soft, gazelle eyes; " why, aunty?" "Maybe God' has called him from the field of battle to a brighter world, darling, where there will be no more war or death." The sweet child put up her round red lip at this suggestion, and laying her curly head upon her aunt's lap, burst into tears. "Don't cry, my darling," said Mrs. Wayland, soothingly " maybe cousin Godfrey is only wound- ed, and will be back again, by and by ; but if God has taken him to the spirit-world, we must submit (205)   206     ITALTA ALMAN; OR, humbly to his-will, Minnie, and not reproach him with our tears." The child raised her 'fair young head from her dimpled arms, and shaking back the glossy curls from her pure forehead, lifted her wet,- brown eyes to thedeep blue sky, and said earnestly- "Aunty, can God do wrong?" "No, darling, God cannot err."

"No, my darling ; God is wiser than we, and though his hand is sometimes heavy upon us, yet in the end, His dispensations are always :for they best." The conversation was here interrupted by the falling of a note at the feet of the speaker, which ran thus:- "Little Minnie's life is in danger; guard well the lovely orphan, or her little head will ere long press the. coffin-pillow. 'We speak that we do know.' -E "Merciful heaven!" exclaimed Mrs. Wayland, "who would harm my darling!" and starting abruptly, she approached the casement 'through which the note had entered, and beheld, in the bright moonlight, the shadow of a man hurrying through the grove.

"What can it mean, Mary?" she continued, as a young girl entered the apartment, and stopped with surprise, at the strange inquiry, and. her lady's excited appearance. "Ma'am," said the girl, as Mrs. Wayland, ceased from relating the circumstance, " that reminds me of a mysterious affair, last night. I was sitting at my chamber window, gazing up at the blue sky be spangled with gold, as usual--for you know they call me the star-gazer--when a low sound attracted my attention, and leaning from the open lattice, I observed the figure of a man stealthily approaching the parlor window, where you and Minnie sat with Parson Dale. I was startled by the attitude and evident desire to remain unnoticed, and instinctive- ly drew  back; but, resolving to watch his move- ments, I again leaned forward, hoping to obtain a ,view  of the face.

And now, maam, my word for it, that man is either the author of this note, or the one who meditates evil."' "I believe you are right, Mary," replied Mrs. Wayland, " and I thank you for your considera- tion," she added, affectionately ; " but who can the stranger be?" -   ( "Indeed, ma'am, I can't imagine, unless it is a relative-" "Minnie has no relatives," interposed Mrs. W., "but myself and son.

The hoarse thunder of old Otto's voice,' in hot pursuit of the flying foe, interrupted the narration of Mrs. Wayland, and carefully securing the prem- ises against the intrusion of midnight marauders, the three retired to their chambers, wondering and ill at ease. The morrow's sun threw his broad smile over the quiet mountain village, and his bright- beams fell in a shower of sparkles amid the quivering foliage of the dark, beautiful grove that environed the pleas- ant mansion of Mrs. Wayland, ldoking like golden spangles dotting a crimson robe.

A S the brilliant flames curled aloft over the city of New London, the light of the conflagration fell upon a pale maiden who wandered among the massacred on Groton hill. Tremblingly she look- ed upon the silent forms around, but- no familiar face was there. On, on she went, wildly brushing- the death-dewed looks from each cold face, and re- coiling in horror as the glazed eyes looked into her own despairing ones. On, on she ran, in that place of death, alone. With a wild scream she suddenly threw herself upon a rigid form stretched upon thte cold, blood- stained earth, and fondlypressed the icy lips of the loved one. She laid her hand upon his heart-a slight tre- mor played beneath it, and with a glad cry she staunched the tiny stream that slowly oozed from a ghastly wound. Casting a glance of horror upon another face that lay beside him, she darted along the banks of the Thames, and when Godfrey Way- land awoke from his fainting sleep, the form of his hated rival had disappeared. Muttering impreca- (211) Ic  ,i   212     ITALIA ALMAN; OR, tions upon the whole race of mankind, he crawled to the camp of the enemy, In a lowly cot on the lovely banks of the bright- flowing Thames, lay a noble youth of nineteen sum-, - mers. By the side of the sick couch stood a fair young girl, watching with intense interest the fine but death-like countenance before her. An old veteran, whose silver locks bespoke the frosts of many winters, stood with folded arms at the feet of the departing one. "It will soon be over-" he said; " the death- struggle will soon be passed, my child; bow to the will of the great Dispenser with meekness and resignation." ,  A heart-sob from the weeping girl awoke the sleeping sufferer, who opened his wild dark eyes upon her. "Cousin!" burst from his feeble lips, as he recognized the pale mlourner-- " where am I? whence come you, Julia? Italia--" he could add no more, but sank back fainting upon the pillow. The old man sprang to resuscitate relaxed animation, while the maiden dropped by the bed-side and adored the heavenly powers for this first faint indi- cationl-of sanity. The bright moonlight stole through the lattice that lovely eve, and mellowed around a snowy couch surrounded by four grateful, happy hearts. "Speak not now," said the old man, as the in- valid looked inquiringly around; " the life-thread may be broken by the slightest exertion. Suffice it   THE CHLD HEIRESS.     213 to say you are in the home of friends who have watched you long, and who now rejoice at the probability of your recovery,- eventually ; but it must be long ere you can escape from the shelter of this humble roof to the bosom of your own far home; but be patient, my son, and rest upon the wisdom of that God whose manifold mercies have sustained you in imminent danger by directing to you the footsteps of this dear girl, to whom, under Him, you owe your existence, and who has so unex- pectedly restored you to the light of reason." The feeble sufferer spoke but one word as he' looked upon the fair girl-"Italia." "I know nothing of her," said the poor victim of a hopeless love, turning ashy white at his in- quiring gaze; " it has been long since we met, and I have not dared to encourage a hope in her heart that I could not myself entertain. I was but return- ing to my own home after a long absence, when the invasion of Arnold drove me from the city, and thinking, perchance, to find some of my kindred among. the slain, I entered -the blood-stained fort, and with the assistance of this good father, bore you to this cottage." The listener closed his dark eyes, and a refreshing slumber stole over his weary frame. The car of Time rolled on with laggard pace, and Harry Verner was enabled to roam along the green banks of the beautiful Thames, leaning upon the arm of the gentle girl, his preserver from almost inevitable death. * -ne .

Long time has passed since I left that blooming old home, shadowed only by one sorrow, and cast a farewell look upon the white vine cot where droops in steal- ing tears, my own Italia." "Not now, my son, not now, said the good father; " yet a little while and you shall breathe the air of that dear home, but now you cannot with safety commence the journey."

With all the precaution of an Indian warrior he deserted the road and halted to watch the movements of the foe who travelled leisurely along, apparently apprehensive of nought that might molest them.   Concealed within the. shadow of the rich foliage that bordered th6 road-side, Otto remained at a respectful distance from the jovial crew, watching with rolling eyes the flutterings of his beloved young mistress' white o robe as it caught the night breeze. She was borne in the arms of a stout horseman in Indian guise, and Otto ground his -teeth as he beheld her delicate form clasped in his unholy' embrace. The loud crack of a fallen bough, beneath his horse's hoof, caused the pursued to halt, and Otto's respiration was suspended as he saw them recon- noitering his vicinity. Happily, however, for the thread of his mortal [21]    216  .ITALIA ALMAN; OR, life, they moved on, satisfied with merely a furtive glance in the rear, and old Africa breathed again.

On, on they went, the aged head of old faithful filled with shining dew. "Let us draw up at this hut, Godfrey," said one of the party, " and allow our good steeds a graze, and a little rest, as well as our own brave selves a recruit, for by I'm tired as the .

The  three marauders were gathered around a dark lamp, seated upon old mouldy blocks, and the most stalwart whom Otto, recognized with superabundant indignation, and who had regained possession -of the insensible Ita- lia, burst forth into congratulations upon the suc- cess of their recent adventure. "Bravo, boys!" cried he, "wasn't it managed nicely! The old woman will think the days of Philip and Swanzey have come again. By but it was gloriously done. Ah, hal my pretty lady, what can all your sweet scorn avail you now ; helpless as a young dove fallen into the snare of the fowler; you shall kneel to me now as I have so often knelt to you, to be spurned for a beardless boy whose puny arm cannot now steal you from my revenge. And yet you are so lovely, -I fain would forget my wrongs and love you still ; but mine you are, beyond the power of God or man to save you, pretty one," and Otto saw his polluted lip desecrate her snowy cheek. "You mean, sneaking, white-livered rat!" said he to himself, shaking his fist in trembling rage at the unsuspecting foe--"I'll show ye, yit, how tu cum fur tu steal me young missus from under me very nose! I'll pummel yer big body so yer mother's son won't know ye.

Away, away, and a little white cottage peeped up on a distant hill-side. Leaving the path he steered directly for the thrice blessed habitation. A little stone wall imposed a barrier between him and the desired haven, but springing down with agility befitting much younger years, he demolished the:pitiful obstruction with the power of a Hercules, and disdaining to bestow a thought upon his lacerated fingers, that betrayed indubitable evi- dence of a briery world, he leaped onward again over the green meadow, and at last threw himself, panting and breathless, against the narrow passway, that creaked and trembled beneath the mighty shock. - "Helloa! there," cried the voice -of one evident- ly'just aroused from slumber, "what's the fuss, I say?"

Three hale youths rushed to the barn-yard, sprang to horse, equipped, and armed, and assign-. ing Otto a fresh steed, the four honest farmers dash- ed madly after their flying guide. Away went good old Otto, his heart beating his side as if seeking an outlet, and burning like a- live coal with fear lest the rebels had deserted the hut bearing far away the dear form  of his helpless young mistress!   CHAPTER    VII. TOT long had the old stranger disappeared down god the winding avenue, from the mansion of Mrs Wayland, ere a female applied for admission at the door that had recently witnessed little Mary's im pertinence, and was admitted by thCat importani personage, with evident pleasure, and ushered intc the presence of the dejected Mrs. W. She was as lovely a girl as large black eyes and jetty ringlets could render a maiden of seventeen summers, and a shade of distress that looked out of those large deep eyes, gave unusual fervor to the pressure with which Mrs. W. folded the little ex- tended hand. "You look pale, Ellie," said Mrs. Wayland, as she gazed earnestly upon. the white cheek and thoughtful brow of the fair visitor--" are you not well?" "Only a little heart-sick," returned the maiden, faintly smiling; " which is but natural, under the circumstances."

"Then you do not know that dear Italia AIman has been abducted by a troop of savages, and that a party of pur villagers, among whom are Robert and Joseph/ is on the pursuit? Mrs. Alman has lain in a delirious state since the heart-rending event, and Dr. Earle almost despairs of a return to consciousness. Aunt Patty is frantic with passion, and old faithful Otto is scouring the land for the poor dear captive." "Merciful Heaven  what will be perpetrated next?" exclaimed Mrs. W., quivering  with ap. prehension. "It's that rascally old surtout, my word for it. ma'am!" said Mary, her deep blue eye snapping with indignation at the unparalleled outrage. "Who?" inquired Ellie unable to recognize the author of so much distress from such a distinguish- ing feature.  "Why, the old slouched-hat man, who found his way into our church last Sabbath, and watched our little Minnie so, with his great grey eyes glittering under his big black brows, like evil spirits peering through the grates of sin I " The listeners could not forbear smiling at this comparison of the little rattle-box Mary, and Ellie said- "It's really strange and inexplicable, Mary, but   222      ITALIA ALMAiN; OR, I have heard the individual you undoubtedly allude to has made very minute inquires- concerning the child Minnie.

He evidently designs to act upon the advice of the philosopher Pittacus --'Never disclose your schemes lest their failure expose you to ridicule, as well as to disappoint. ment'-that is, if he really has a special object in view." "And that he has," cried Mary, or- lie would n't be lurking about, under the cover of night," and she forthwith -communicated to the astonished Ellie the circumstances already known to the reader. "But where is the child?" said the fair girl, -as Mary ended the strange story. "I have not seen her yet." "In the garden," answered Mrs. W.; "we do not suffer her to wander beyond the enclosure." Ellie rose and walked to a window, overlooking the blooming old garden. Her dark eyes swept down the broad, gravelly walks, peered through the vine-covered bowers, clumps of roses and lilacs, anid: at last rested upon the thick hedge at the base.

Round and round she went down the flower- edged walks, pushing back the thick vines, peering through the rose clumps, and down behind the green hedge; -but no Minnie was there, and the hushed air resounded with her eager cries for the missing one. Mrs. Wayland   and Ellie stood like statues, against the window-sill, watching the movements tii  of the flying girl, seemingly incapable of changing thleir position, but as Mary was observed returning pale and breathless, after her ineffectual search thev sprang along the old hall, and beheld her disappear- ing through  the side gate that opened into the wide, dark grove. Gently sloping, it stretched away to the starry lake, whose golden sparkles were shut out from the old mansion, by the thick foliage of ancient elms that spread their sturdy arms over the green sward beneath, obstructing the bright wealth of the skies, all but a few straggling sunbeams. On, on ran the eager Mary, making the welking ring again, with the echoes of her frightened voice, Mrs. Wayland and Ellie following in her flyingy steps. Midway the mansion and the lakes, the   224      ITALIA ALMAN j OR, object of their search was discovered with a tall woman robed in black, who guided the artless child further and further from her home. Mary uttered a glad cry and bounded forward, which arrested the attention of the stranger, who, perceiving the advancing girl, caught the little Minnie in her arms, and ran from the approaching Mary. The lovely girl screamed with affright, and stretched her dimpled hands towards her faithful nurse. Mrs. Wayland saw the tall flying form, and the outstretched arms of her screaming darling, and, with a low, heart-broken cry, she sank fainting to the ground. "Ellie knelt beside the inanimate form, and Ma- ry alone remained to witness the fate of the little struggler. On and on she went, and on, on flew the.,dark captor. Now the silver bubbles of the blue lake broke through the green leaves of the swaying branches, and an icy chill crept around her heart as she saw the swift feet of the tall form bending towards its sparkling wave. And now another form greeted her sight, as she rushed wildly along. From behind a little 'copse - between her and the pursued, the old stranger of the " slouched hat"' dashed forth, and, dropping his heavy cane, joined in the race!

Stealing silently along, the honest farmer applied his eye to the crevice, and surveyed the occupants. "All right," said he, withdrawing a little wayl; "now, boys, rush in and bind them, but no murder done if it can be avoided." "Shute um down, down! the painted varmints!" cried Otto, jumping up and down in his excitement -" de sneakin' rats don't wuth a living!" A mighty crash levelled the door, and in rushed the armed foe upon the bewildered miscreants. "Perdition 1'" screamed Godfrey Wayland, start- ing up; and the delicate form of Italia fell from his embrace upon the floor. Otto plunged forward like a tiger after its prey, and snatching her with. a shout of triumph in his arms, the- big tears of joy rolled down his furrow- ed cheeks like summer drop's from a thunder-cloud. A fierce struggle ensued, the besieged contend- (226) -1 *   THE CHLD HEIRESS.     227 ing desperately for liberty. Swords clashed, curses loud and deep rose above - the war-din. The little hut quivered to its foundation beneath the mighty conflict. Bravely fought the outnumbered party, till two shots from the Yankee boys laid their victims low. One only remained; Godfrey Wayland contending against the fearful odds. Dashing through the door, he plunged into the gloom beyond, making a sweep at Otto as he went, which left upon his right ear a living monument to the memory of this traitor to his country and outrager of every feel- ing of humanity; but, fortunately for good old faithful, it merely proved the proficiency of the desperado in the science of Division. The three farm youths bounded after the flying foe, joined by Bob Winters and Jo Wilkins ; and anon a shot boomed in the distance. "Sissers tu grind I!" grunted Africa, holding on tenaciously to the assaulted protuberance-"I 'm not a hog, mister Godfrey, that I shood hav a slit in me yer, I ain't.

The brave lads returned with information high- ly unsatisfactory to Otto ; the flying foe had eluded their grasp, aided by the darkness of the forest. ' Dod-blast-im!" 'said Jo Wilkins,'venting his spite and: disappointment by sending his leather cap, rolled into a round ball, hard up against the old mouldy logs-don't I wish I'd had a hand in the beginning on 't!" "Say, Jo didn't make him ssmell"-said Bob, looking knowingly in the down-cast face of the honest youth. "You go tu grass!" said Jo, picking up a little ball, and, unrolling it into something like cap-shape, lie brought it with a nervous jerk over his flushed brow, and strode out of the hut just as the first red streak of dawn broke over the eastern hills. The two lifeless forms of the British soldiers being decently disposed of, the still insensible Italia was gently borne to the home of the good farmer, and committed to the motherly care of the pitying house-wife. At an early hour, Otto was again pursuing his Gilpin race in the direction of his mountain home, but with far different emotions than those that had urged him on the night previous. The heart of old faithful'was light and joyous, and'diffused its sunshine throughout the white. cottage of his despairing mistress, who was unexpectedly restored   THE CHLD HEIRESS.     22! to reason, and who, ere long, clasped to her mater- nal bosom the frail form of her only child. "Gosh-a-mity! ole flat-nose"-said Otto, as he finished recapitulating the marvellous events of the pursuit and rescue, to the wide-awake Patty, "didn't I ax ye whar ye 'd fine more curage dan in de heart of ole Otto.?

E'yahI E'yahl " and Otto shook his sides to his heart's content over the brave memories of the past. Weeks wore on, and shadows hovered darkly over two hearths ; uncertainty clouded the fate of Harry Verner, and the veil of mourning clothed each loving heart. The sister of Harry-the love- ly Alice-sat beside the slumbering form of her brother's love, gazing musingly upon the gorgeous beauty of an autumnal sunset, when her father entered the chamber, flashes of delight streaming from his blue eyes, as he joyfully exclaimed: "He lives, Alice! our dear boy lives, on the banks of the Thames, saved by the hand of our returning Julia, from the savage minions of the traitor Arnold, and will soon be back again to his long mourning home!? This cheering news rent the veil of care that shaded each Ione heart, and facilitated the recovery of the invalid Italia. A glad shout, and " hurraw fur gin'ral Washin'- ton! E'yah! E'yahll!" floated from the spread lips    230       ITALIA ALMAN. of our black hero, back to the happy homestead, as he- dashed down the hill-side in quest of "massa -Harry. A little group was gathered in the vine-latticed porch of Col. Verner, one golden eve. Bright, tearful eyes pierced the settling shadows of the dewy twilight, and far away, along the white road, a carriage rolled with rapid sweep. Nearer and still nearer it came, till the sound of its revolving wheels fell like sweet music upon the fluttering hearts of the anxious watchers. Nearer and still nearer, and the glad -words that rise upon the eve- ning air, as a pale soldier springs to the arms of waiting ones, tell that Harry Verner has come back again. The dark eyes of the beautiful Italia hid their bright sparkles in blushing tremulousness upon his bosom, as the manly arms of the young soldier drew, her willowy form, quivering like a frightened dove, in one long and fond embrace to his warmly- throbbing heart.   CHAPTER IX. W02 siiths llXymS.    W82 Rkbelmff   t.- AS the blue eyes of faithful Mary unclosed from her death-like swoon, they rested -upon the aged form of the mysterious stranger kneeling be- side her, and dripping with the glittering drops from the blue lakelet. Little Minnie threw her dimpled arms about her loved nurse, and with a childish scream of joy buried her golden head of wet and matted curls in her sheltering bosom, and sobbed in terror and gladness. "By zounds I " said the old gentleman, patting Mary's white cheek with much complacency-' by zounds I but you're a brave gal, if you are a saucy one. Now what would you a-done if it hadn't been for old Miles Howard, hey?" and he pointed significantly to the bright waters, and a dark form stretched upon the sandy shore. The young girl shuddered as her eyes fell upon the tall prostrate one, and turning to the old man she mechanically asked-"Who is she?" "Blessed if I know!" said the old gentleman; ' but let's look for dryer quarters, and a snugger- (231)   232     ITALIA ALMAN; ORj bed-" lhe added, lifting up the light form of the trembling girl, and drawing her, with the little ' child, away from the frightful scene.

Mary lifted her face with surprise to the strange man, at this declaration, but he turned from her inquiring gaze with a lurking smile, and added- "never mind!" As they neared the spot where sat Ellie beside the insensible Mrs. Wayland, she opened her lan- guid eyes, and extended her feeble arms towards the sweet child, then with a faint cry swooned again. Old Howard lifted her from the damp earth, and with the aid of the two girls bore her to her cham- ber.; Assistance was -called to the strange woman who had sought the life of the little innocent, and she, too, ivas conveyed to the mansion of Mrs. Wayland, with the hope- of obtaining from her dying lips the occasion of so unaccountable an adventure,-the wound inflicted by Mr.- Howard's weapon having been examined by Dr. Earle, and pronounced by him to be mortal. "Polly White!" almost shrieked Mrs. W., as she Ibent over and removed the dark hood and veil from her deathly countenance. The outcast opened her wild black eyes, and muttered-"Yes, Emma Villiers, it is I, your foe-   THE CHLD HEIRESS.     283 the outcast-you made me so--you stole 'him- William Wayland-from me, and I hated you in childhood, in youth, and in age, and I am revenged in your son.

I hated you, Emma Villiers, and I have ruined your son ; he is not, dead, but lives-a traitor, .a murderer, and a robber! Italia Alman is his victim. I planned it all, ha! ha!-for you stole him from me, and my hate has followed you. H--hate--" her voice became inaudible, a quiver convulsed her frame, the long white fingers grasped the coverlet, relaxed, and-the outcast was -dead I! Mrs. Wayland spoke no word-the mother's heart was crushed. Dr. Earle led her from the death- couch to her darkened chamber, and her low voice never echoed again beyond its limits. The daylight was fading behind the dim old hills, where the scattered leaves lay in gold and crimson heaps, moaning and rustling in the requiem winds. It was a sad autumnal twilight, and lonely and desolate seemed the still halls of Mrs. Wayland's proud mansion ; lonely and desolate--for death had been there, and suffering threw a dark shadow over each pale face that watched beside a breaking heart.

She motioned assent, and, laying her furrowed cheek upon an open palm, while the long hair fell over it in threads of silver-he began,   CHAPTER   X. i TN   youth I was wayward and passionate. 1 Proud and obstinate, I never forgave what I deemed a wrong. In early life, my parents were laid in the silent churchyard, and I was an orphan in a cold world. At the age of twenty-five I wed- ded a fair, frail girl, and forgot in her smiles my early loneliness." "I had a friend-a bold, stern man, the father of a beautiful girl-an only daughter. My son was two years her senior. She grew to- graceful, blushing womanhood, and the tendrils of a father's heart wound closely around his young idol. Bright and brilliant were the dreams he cherished for the future of his beautiful girl, but they melted away in darkness and mourning! A wanderer from the Western world came to our quiet home-place, and stole the heart of the youthful maiden. Her father forbade the dream of love-she fled from his heart, and they were married.

"A letter came from the New World--a long letter, full of the love of a daughter's heart. Pearls of past memories filled the old man's eyes, as he drank in the fond words of a loving child, but the hand of pride and unyielding obduracy sealed up again affection's missive and returned it whence it came-to this mountain village. "Years passed away. A direful scourge swept over the city, and all beneath the moss-spotted roof of the old castle perished but the unforgiving father. Mine, too, my wife and my noble son, fell asleep one blue starry eve, and awoke in eternity. ' And now was seen the wisdom of an all-wise and just God. The old man was alone now, in the evening of life, and his softened heart yearn- ed for sympathy. His thoughts came over the White foam of old Ocean, and memory drew strains of remorse from the well-attuned chords of con- science. "I had no tie to bind me to my boyhood's home, and my restless spirit longed for change of scene. I embarked on board a noble ship, and bade adieu to them shores of England for a land convulsed by the heavy tramp and loud booming of war, over the green shroud and -deep sepulchre of the ocean.

I learned that she was dead, the beautiful scion of a proud race, and he who lurled her to a stranger la-id. They told me of this child, and pointed to your mansion as her home. I came here one eve, purpos- ing to disclose all,-but you were not alone, and I hesitated. "I returned this morning and was repulsed,--why, I could not divine; but a vague apprehension took possession of my mind from the language of this brave girl here, whom I have learned to love, since. "Leaving your dwelling, I discerned the form of the little child, and, hastening forward, I con- cealed myself in a thick clump, wishing to look upon her unobserved. The flight of the dark wo- man, and pursuit of the girl, awoke me to a con- sciousness of ill, and, I followed. The rest you know. I have murdered an outcast, and rescued the child. This, Emma Wayland, is the old man's story." He. drew from his bosom, as he concluded, a golden locket, and held it up to Mrs. W. "Minnie's mother I!" ejaculated she, as her eyes rested upon it. "And my child!" said the old man ; "I am the repentant father."   238     ITALIA ALMAN  OR, , 'Minnie sprang froit her aunt's bosom' to the speaker's neck, and with her little soft arms twined around it, screamed "Grandpapa!" Mary dropped beside the "old-surtout," and cried for joy. A happy flush overspread the pale- face of Mrs. Wayland as she exclaimed,-- "Thank heaven, my darling has found a friend." The old man folded the tiny, clinging girl in his strong arms,: and bowing his head upon her little nestling one, the large tears fell from his dim eyes amid her silky curls. It was a happy group, though the rustle of angel wings was caught by the spirit-ear of the pale sufferer. She could lie calmly down, now, ill the lone hush of the voiceless tomb, with a smile upon her icy lip, for her darling, the sweet Child Heiress, had found a father in the venerable and mysterious 'stranger. Lovingly did the warm hearts nurtured in the mountain home of Mrs. Wayland watch beside her- pillow.  Aged matrons and young maidens glided noiselessly around the sick chamber, bathing the fevered brow and soothing the weary spirit of the victim: of an erring child. And little round'faces peered through the curtain-folds into the sad and silent room, white with the- thought of death,- Tenderly and with a daughter's assiduity: Italia Alman lingered around the heart-brokenimother; but futile were the efforts of love, for the decree had gone forth from the court -of Heaven--"Thy days are numbered," and the white angel bore the   THE CHLD HEIRESS,      239 vital spark that animated the clay-tenement, to the full blaze of eternity. They smoothed back the dark hair upon her throbless, brow, drew the snow-white sheet over the thin pale hands folded above her pulseless heart, and the muslin drapery fell around her rigid form, sweetly resting from the cares of life in one long and dreamless sleep. Mr. Howard lifted the little sobbing child in his arms, and, parting the curtain-folds, bent over the still slumberer for a last, last look. The little one threw her plump arms over the sleeper, and, pressing her rosy lips to the cold cheek, screamed and clung wildly to the throbless bosom. She could not then realize the extent of this be- reavement, but the tiny helpless one had lost a second motheir. Good and sympathizing in life, the broken- hearted was mourned and remembered by loving hearts long after the brown mould lay heavily above her hushed heart, and the green moss spread smoothly over her slender grave. The immense wealth of Mr. Howard was poured into the heavy coffers of his beautiful' grandchild, who was the pride and solace- of the good old man's declining years. Mary clung to her young charge, and learned to love the- "old surtout" as much as -she had feared and distrusted him.

Poor Julia loved her cousin Harry with all the fervor of a first affection, and secret sorrow preyed upon her young cheek from a consciousness that the heart she prized above all else that earth could bestow was given to the peerless daughter of widOw Alman. One moonlight eve she wandered from the bright hearth of her uncle's home, and strayed beneath the almost exfoliated grove that wooded the mountain side, the warm tears trembling over her pale cheek, and bedewing the crumbling foliage that rustled beneath her feet. Suddenly a tall form darted from a vine-covert, and seized her with an iron grasp. '(Peace!" cried a smothered voice, " or this mo- ment shall be- your last." ":Godfrey Wayland!" cried the startled Julia, and shuddered at his presence. "You tremble," said the cruel man ; " aye, well (240)            '   THE CHLD HEIRESS.     241 may you quiver, for here, on this lone spot, inj view of yonder home, but with no arm to save you from my revenge, you die, unless you swear to betray to me your rival, Italia A-lman." "And think you, bold man, that I will betray the innocent into your ruthless hands to save a life less valued? Falsely have you estimated my principles if you think to fright me, by your unmanly threats, to your base purposes." Wildly flashed the midnight eyes of the incarnate demon, at this response, and lifting his glittering sword to her defenceless breast, he spoke in trem- bling rage: "Julia Orme, you think I dare not dye this steel with your blood--you think this but a feint to extort obedience to my will. Risk it not, rash girl, if you value life. If you refuse compliance, I can plunge this deadly steel into your bosom with as little compunction as I would strike it to the heart of the veriest foe. Decoy her to my arms, and you save your own life and rid yourself of a rival. Blush not; I -can read the secrets of the heart with- out listening to the language of the lips. I pledge myself to promote her happiness to the utmost -of my power, and never raise my hand against him you love. If you refuse, I swear to pursue him to the end of the earth, till my sword shall reach his cowardly heart; and here, with no eye to witness the deed, it shall spill your own life-blood." "Then I die," said the noble girl; "for I will never betray the innocent." "   ITATjTA ATMAN; OR,  With savage fury he plunged his sword into her heaving bosom, and the warm blood bathed its pol- ished surface. Nought but the pale moon, and the stars that looked down from their blue home, witnessed this deed, whose lightest word would harrow up the soul," and the vile murderer fled unharmed from the bloody scene; but the mark of Cain was upon him. Slowly tolled the village bell for the burial of Julia Orme., Theylaid her in the cold grave when the morning dew glittered upon the drooping blos- soms of fading autumn, and the golden sunshine gleamed over the eastern hills upon her narrow home. They rounded the damp sod above her youthful form, so calmly resting amid the shadowy hush, and Harry Verner mourned in deep heart- sorrow the untimely fate of the preserver of his own existence.         ,    : Aslip was found beside the cold form of the mur- dered maiden, containing the words-" Behold, Harry Verner, the work of one who swears beside the dying-form of the object of his vengeance, to bury the same red steel in your own base heart! " and Harry Verner registered a vow above the new- made;grave to avenge the murder of his unfortunate cousin, In October,,after this unmanly and barbarous deed, Harry Verner',stood upon the banks of the York river,r tankig in the detachment led by the gallant Hamilton. A spirit of revenge for the   *   1'',   death of the helpless orphan burned in his bosom, and the cry of his heart was "blood for blood; whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." In raising the parapets preparatory to the attack of the foe, none labored with more diligence than he; and at each dismounted gun of the enemy, and as the dispersing smoke of the roaring cannon displayed to his burning eye demolished portions of their fortifications, his heart knew but one sound -revenge  All the energies of his soul were exerted to reach the treacherous& heart of the murderer of innocence and helplessness; but the powers of dark- ness seemed combined to aid- the miscreant in escaping every directed shot. Harry Verner was, to appropriate the language of Col. Hamilton, "incapable of imitating examples of barbarity ;" but when, by the impetuous assault of the detachment, possession was obtained of the British redoubt, and he met, face to face, the.defeat- ed Godfrey Wayland, he did not forget "recent provocation," but buried his sword in -his dastard heart, and let out the crimson tide forwhich his cousin's cold lips seemed loudly calling. Thus died this murderous traitor, Godfrey Way- land, " as a fool dieth ;" receiving upon America's slighted soil, and from the hand of him whom he had so deeply wronged, his infamy's reward.   CHAPTER XII. IT was a lovely May morning, in 1784. The village bell rang out a merry peal as a bridal party awound along the mountain path that led to the little white church. The gorgeous sunlight was gleaming from the azure skies and quivering in golden pools about their pathway, and the sweet wild notes of the greenwood minstrels went up in a glad gush to the bending heavens, while earth's orchestra of rills caught up the swelling symphony, and Nature's heart kept time to the full chorus of the joyous things of life. A slight form, in spotless white, leaned in blushing beauty upon the supporting arm of a tall, graceful man, who preceded the happy train. Know you, kind reader, that one was Harry Verner. The timid grace of the youth of nineteen was lost in the proud dignity of manhood, and as his dark eye rested fondly on the gentle one beside him, it spoke of bolder confidence than was its (244)   THE CHLD HEIRESS.      245 wont, when looking upon the fair face of Italia Alman. As they passed through the arched door-way, Harry Verner cast a sorrowful glance upon the grave of- her to whom he owed under God the happiness of this glad hour. How many memories clustered around that hallowed spot, where the round dew shone in the morning light, amid the soft moss and the opening flowers that- spread a mantle of beauty over the early dead, and bordered with verdure and bloom a narrow home beyond it--the last rest of the broken-hearted victim of an erring child! Our black hero, Otto, squeezed into the crowded sanctuary, resolved to witness the ratification of a treaty which bestowed upon " massa Harry," now that ;' the strife was past, the victory won," the rich reward of his virtuous merit. As the shadows of twilight lengthened along the breezy hill-sides, and queenly Night " threw her mantle o'er the world, and pinned it with a star," there were busy feet and merry voices beneath the low brown roof of the white cottage. The long 'silvery locks of saucy Mary's " old surtout" mingled with the golden curls o0 the Child Heiress, as, with her tiny head nestled upon his shoulder, they watched the smiling group, "tripping the light fantastic toe," as they whirled and floated and swam in the flood of yellow lamp- light. "God bless 'em!" said Jo Wilkins, as a bright   246       ITA LTA ALMAN. blush stole over the face of the girl-bride, when old Miles Howard laid a hand upon their youthful heads and blessed the wedded pair; and many a loving heart re-echoed, "God bless them." "Giory-tu-graciousl I? said Otto, as-he marched around the kitchen with all the dignity of a major- general surveying his troops, the fire poker sur- mounting his shoulder--" gory-tu-gracious 1 but dis is de gloriuses' nite ole Otto ever- winked in!

"What! come home in another fret, my dear?" returned Mrs. Monkton. "I believe that girl will ever arise, like an evil genius, to disturb your equanimity ; but what is the offence now?" "Offence now!" reiterated the enraged beauty, with a scornful curve of her cherry lip that looked like an opening rosebud,-" why, the same prepos. terous arrogance that ever characterized her: her self-confidence is insufferable, and I can't see why that silly-headed Merton suffers himself to be held "'         (249)   II *" il r :j   i   "LIA ROSELY; OR,              ' in leading-strings, just for all the world like a blind' beggar !" "I comprehend the offence now, my dear," said her mother mildly, "and I regret to find, my daughter, that you are disposed to be so censorious and caustic, because you have failed to enlist one more among your numerous train of admirers. I fear you have none of your mother's spirit, my child, or you would have more charity for one who has innocently come between you and your super- abundant vanity." "Innocently!" repeated Harriette; "yes, she was very innocent in calling Merton to come over to her when she saw him approaching me; she was very innocent in taxing all her powers of coquetry to detain him near her throughout the entire evening. Innocent! heaven defend me from innocence, then." "Bat let the remembrance of her unparalleled modesty and timidity exculpate her from intention- ally depriving you of his society; are you quite sure he was seeking you, or was he going in quest of something for her ?

Do be generous, my dear child, and- never condemn precipitately.  I am sure your father and myself never, instilled into your young mind such a principle of injustice." "I am not unjust, mamma," cried the wayward maiden, lolling back in her easy chair, and laugh-  THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.   251   ing pertinaciously in her mother's face; :'ah, mamma, I see you don't love me as well as-you know-I won't call her pretty name; and so I will accept young Rodman, and have a home of my own up on Broadway, and then you can take her here to comfort you with her 'innocent' and 'modest' teachings, for the absence of the 'unchari- table' and 'ungenerous' Harriette !" "My child, how can you pain me thus?" said the mother, tears gushing profusely from her eyes, at the heatlessness of her daughter: "you know, Harriette, I am more opposed to Rodman than any of your slitors, and I know you speak thus pur- posely to distress me." "How can such an 'unjust' creature as I am distress you?" ejaculated Harriette, not at all affected by her mother's tears. "I should think such an exchange would delight you.  I never knew one who did not decidedly prefer the society of a loved one, to one in whom they had no con- fidence." "Harriette ! Harriette!" cried the poor mother, starting up and taking her daughter's hand, "re- flect, my child, before you utter words that may one day be as a serpent's sting.  You know, Harriette, that I cannot long remain here; con- sumption, you are well aware, has long owned me for its victim, and when the cold earth shall hide me forever from your sight, then, Harriette, every unfeeling word you have ever spoken will rise up in judgment against you.

I cannot tacitly sub- mit to such imposition, and unless you can bring yourself to be guided- by principles of honor and reason, she must no longer remain beneath this roof; for she has already, like the torpid viper, stung the hand that warmed it into life." "Who is 'unjust' now, mamma?" cried the in- corrigible girl, trying to laugh away the effect produced by her mother's words; "poor, dear aunt Mary, that never did any body harm in her- life-who is as 'innocent' as a babe, and never spoke unkindly to any one; how can you, mamma, speak disparagingly of her V" Just then the door opened, and a woman of low stature, thin almost to emaciation, entered the chamber.

She was dressed in deep mourning, and a profusion of silver-tinged curls that fell around her pale brow, showed an effort at display not very becoming to one of her age, which must have been bordering on fifty. "Oh, aunt Mary, I want your consolation!' cried Ilarriette, starting up and twining her arms about her neck; "mamma won't comfort me for the loss of handsome Merton, but attributes injustGce to my indignation because of Lilia Rosely's ruse in wiling him away when I was about to triumph. I want revenge, and I will have it." "Oh! Harriette, that I should have lived to be subjected to the deep humiliation of hearing so debasing an expression from a child of mine!" exclaimed Mrs. Monkton, starting back, horror depicted on her paleface. "Mary," continued she, "you have instilled this principle in her bosom, and I cannot permit her to remain longer under your tutelary care. I am exceedingly grieved to be under the necessity of saying this to you, Mary, but for my child's sake I may not avoid it. You know what she once was, and what she now is; and to whom may the unhappy change be attributed? I know, Mary, your motives are good, though your actions are wrong ; and I have warned you ofttimes against fanning the flames of self-love, ;which like a sweeping avalanche scatters desolation before it; but you have added fuel to the flame of vanity, until she becomes miserable be-   254      LILIA' ROSELY; OR, cause of unsuccess in the effort to add one more to the list of her numerous lovers.

"Not merely for the sake of conquest," returned Harriette, hiding her face upon Mary's bosom ; "I would resign all my other lovers, to make him surrender." "You have unjustly} arraigned me, my dear madam, said Mary, with visible emotion, placing her pale lip to the beautifill fair forehead of the young girl, as it:nestled in snowy whiteness and purity upon her bosom,: amid the deep folds of her sable dress ; "I know Harriette's nature even bet- ter thian you do, because I have sought to under- stafnd it thoroughly ; I trust you will 'not consider her, little outhreaks of passion are owing to my injudicious:' instruction I You must remember, my dear madam, that love provokes jealousy, and jeal- ousy, passionate expressions; therefore you will pardon, with all- a mother's lenity, the little pettish- ness wtehali the blind god spitefully evokes." i'"-But love in a right bosom does not exhibit itself--in so unfavorable a light,' said Mrs. Monk- ton, mournfully,- leaning her head upon her hand with an expression of pain upon her countenance.

True love makes any sacrifices for the one beloved, and does   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.     255 not apply such opprobrious epithets as 'silly-headed,' through which Harriette conveyed her figure with reference to Mr. Merton." "But you do not suppose," returned Mary, now much interested in the conversation--" that a girl of seventeen can deport herself with all the for- bearance and self-command of a woman of thirty? You do not mean to imply that true love is never accompanied by impatience and jealousy?" "I do mean to imply this," replied Mrs. Monk- ton; "true love and petulant jealousy are alto- gether incompatible. That is not true affection that kindles momentarily into a passionate excite- ment when the object of it looks at or speaks to another. I call not this love, as some term it-- indeed I never could define it unless it is a tortu- ous monomania, for it subverts the peace of both parties, innocent and guilty, if manifested after marriage, and is a-a-feeling, or passion, if I may so term it, that absence will soon extirpate; but this is never cherished by any but selfish, con- tracted, and tyrannical minds. Jealousy! don't tell .me it is the inseparable companion of love-that love canniot be perfect without it; I never could believe in this system as some do-on the con- trary, I should never believe that love perfect or of long duration, where distrust was manifestly a part." "I never heard such a view taken of this subject before," said Mary, looking musingly at the bright coals in the grate, with an unusual wildness in her   256      LILIA ROSELYe-OR, large, dark eye; but do tell me what your ideas of love are."            ( "Certainly,"-returned Mrs. Monkton, "I will give you an illustration of my views on this subject. Love is an unfathomable deep, like the mighty ocean, still, calm, 'and peaceful, unless rocked by the battling elements of some adverse storm; but not lashed into fury by every little wind that passes' over it. True love is too stable to be shaken by trivial circumstances, like the passion that is frequently mistaken for it, and which may be reckoned like the eddies of the shallow stream that are everlastingly whirling and dashing, and cease- lessly heard in the distance. This is an indication that there is a deeper fountain far away; but it were a miracle, indeed, if the burning rays of dis- trust do not wholly absorb it, ere it emerges into its silent rest." "But you do not mean to say that a light pas- sion may not gradually flow into a deep sea of love?" queried Mary, looking piercingly at Mrs. Monkton. "I believe there is but one basis upon which love ever rests-namely, Virtue-and but one source from whence it can spring, and that is Purity," answered Mrs. Monkton.  "Now you may think it animates bosoms of the vicious as well as the virtuous, and that it may cling as tenaciously around an unworthy as a worthy object. I believe minds, noble by nature but degenerate by art, may love, in every sense of the word; but they plunge        s   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    257 headlong into the sea, dazzled by the extrinsic beauty or brilliancy of the object; but alas 1 how often do they split upon a rock of disappointment, and watch the wreck of hope tossed by the wave of time around them I then they reflect upon the folly of being blind because they would not see. But if you will observe it, such a one never launches forth again without a guarantee of per- fect security. But if the affections of a precipitate heart fortunately rest upon a worthy object, and that/ one, detecting the gem beneath its uncouth maasi, reciprocates the feeling, the least worthy imbibes the purity of its superior, and becomes re- fined and purified; for love purifies the heart, and as 'evil communications corrupt good manners,' so this rule may in all justice be reversed." "I never- heard such a- dissertation in my life, before," said Mary, half laughing, half musing. "I don't know how to decide, really, though it seems very plausible; but I have known one in- stance that would refute your argument. Do you know," said she, turning quickly to Mrs. Monkton, "that I have been married?" "You!" cried Mrs. Monkton, distending her eyes with astonishment-" no, indeed I 'I never had the most remote idea of such a fact." "Well, it is a fact," responded she, "and he whom I married possessed the most contracted mind that ever human form encased, and yet he loved me with all the fervor that ever a -virtuous heart was capable of cherishing."     258      LILIA ROSELY; OR,-. "Give us a proof of the sincerity of his love," said Mrs. Monkton ; " let us see if :my theory will not hold good." 2 W' Well, I cannot give you a more indubitable one, than that he committed suicide because he fancied I loved another." "And does an act of jealous desperation confirm the strength of his devotion? But tell me, was he invariably kind, and gentle, and affectionate, to you?" ": Kind, and gentle, and affectionate?" repeated Marv, staring at her; "no, indeed and that is what always puzzled me. - He was sometimes gen- tle as a dove,and his caresses bountifully be- stowed ; but if I cast a casual glance at a passer- by, or returned a salutation, he forthwith construed it into admiration or affection, and would weep and rant like a madman." "And you call this love?" answered Mrs. Monk- ton; "I 'should designate it tortuous monomania;- were you happy?" "Happy!" cried Mary--" do you ask it?" "But did- you love him?" inquired Mrs. Monk- ton. ' He is gone now," returned Mary, "and I must not reply to this." "Bt do tell me," said Mrs. Monkton, who under- stood her perfectly, " did you ever love him?" '":Yes, truly I did," cried she, with' an emphasis that admitted of no doubt of her sincerity.  "There is one of: my instances of precipitancy,"   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    259 said Mrs. Monkton, smiling; " you hit upon a rocky Mary, and the'vacancy of your eye, which I never- before could explain, tells but too plainly of the wreck of hope. Allow me to read your charac- ter." "Well." "You were once beautiful and admired, which inspired vanity. You possessed a naturally noble and gifted mind, but flattery subverted its best qualities. You met him, a stranger-is it not so?"  "I Yes." "He was handsome, ambitious, and conceited, and, withal, hypocritical. He wooed you from ambition to enjovy a triumph over his many rivals, and when his pride was gratified by the possession of your hand, he became jealous of your love, because he knew himself unworthy. Your daily- increasing indifference, arising from conviction of his unworthiness, drove him to desperation, and in a fit of jealous frenzy he perpetrated an act which you call confirmation of love." "You have read aright!" cried Mary, starting up and traversing the chamber; "it was precisely so; by what instinct judge you so rightly?': "By 'experience, observation, and a knowledge of human nature," answered Mrs. Monkton. "Experience! how?" cried Mary, stopping sud- denly before her, with. an- expression that Mrs. Monkton could not define. "I once loved one who I thought was a model   260      LILIA ROSELY; OR, of perfection; but my father, on his deathbed, in- sisted that I should marry Mr. Monkton, and ere he died we were united in his presence. I thought my heart would break then, when my dear fat!her died, for I had no other near friend, and I hated my husband - in my heart, because he had come be- tween me and Frederic Raymond." Mary started back, and fell against Mrs. Monk- ton's couch, who did not observe her intense emo- tion. "I did not know, then," continued Mrs. Monkton, "that he loved me, and that a contract between him and my father united him to one who he knew loved another. Mine was an instance in which the least worthy imbibed the purity of its superior, and oh, how grateful am I that Provi- dence interposed to rescue me! for I learned from good authority that the union of Frederic Ray- rmond with one who was said to be my counterpart in mind, though unlike in person, was a most wretched one." "Judge for yourself," said Mary, advancing towards her, with the wildness of a maniac in her eye-" behold his victim!" "Merciful Heaven!" almost screamed Mrs. Monkton, starting to her feet, "do I see -lMrs. Ray- mond?" "You do," answered Mrs. Raymond, in a voice strangely calmt-"You see one whom he you loved reduced fron affluence to beggary.

I knew you ere I came, a homeless wanderer, to seek a shelter beneath your roof; I came not to instil principles of injustice in the bosom of your daughter; for I have watched over her, and coun- selled her with the affection and solicitude of a mother, and from consideration for your feelings-- for there is a sympathy that unites me to you: I have rbfrained from exposing her faults, believing they were but the appurtenances of youth which maturity would dislodge. But you distrust my truth and friendship, and I must go forth from this shel- tering roof, where I have learned to be content, into the cold-hearted world, to find a, home else- where." "Forgive my injustice," said Mrs. Monkton, sink- ing upon a seat and weeping violently at the despairing tone of her friend ; "I have wronged you, I feel and know it, but distress for the unfold- ing imperfections of my child has led me to so egregious an error ; but you can forgive me." "I have nothing to forgive," said Mrs. Raymond, taking her extended hand. "I admit you have cause to doubt me, for Harriette's vanity and self- love are far greater then when I first knew her; but you will remember she was not then exposed to the deteriorating breath of flattery; she was too young then to be affected by its pleasing whispers. 7Tis the adulation of the society in which she moves that has wrought this change which you innocent- ly attributed to myinfluence.

BYRON. :]1 Y, DEAR," said aunt Mary to Harriette, who ni had been sitting before the -mirror several hours,-with two maids adorning her for the party that night, "I beg you will not wear that towering wreath with such an abundance of curls, and that diamond circlet; it really is not becoming to mai- den modesty. How much more meek and innocent you would appear with a simple white bud in your curls,or, if you prefer it, that circlet alone; super- fluity destroys all natural beauty." "Martha and Jane say it looks magnificently, aunt Mary," replied Harriette ; and you know I am to be queen, to-night, and- I must exhibit a queenly appearance." "Your mother will not approve of it, Harriette, and it is your duty to conform willingly to her wishes." "iOh, mamma is so methodical in her views I they never coincide with mine, aunt Mary; do let me have my own way once." "My dear- child, I have no right to command (261)   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    265 you, but I have much consideration for your dear mother's feelings. I was once like you, dear, ad my appearance on a similar occasion ruined me:. "You!l how, aunt Mary?" "Before I ever saw my husband, I was addressed 1Xy a noble man, who was the admiration of the circle in which we moved ; and, elated with my tri- umph over my young lady-friends, and fancying that dress rendered me fascinating, I one night appeared at a party adorned as fancifully as you bid fair to be to-night, and the consequence was, he discovered his mistake in estimating my mind, and I lost him for- ever. He had not committed himself with me, and the next day he left town and I have never seen him since. Much display may captivate some minds, . but they are too light to remain long in one place- every little wind tosses them hither and thither." "Here, Martha, give me that white rose-bud in the vase yonder; and Jane, take away these false curls--hav'n't I a plenty of natural ones without them, aunt Mary?" "Yes, indeed-you look far sweeter now,. said Mrs. R., as she pinned the bud, with a silver dart, amid her beautiful ringlets, and kissed her fair cheek; t"and now take off that rose-colored sash, and you will please me perfectly." "Well, for you sake and mamma's, I will; but I shall look like a cottage girl, in this simple white robe, and one pitiful bud for a head-dress." "You look more like the daughter of a Christian woman, as you are," said aunt Mary. "Ah, Har- 12   .                 ,(   266      LILIA ROSELY; OR, riette, there is a gem in that bosom, if it were only tished! 4 Now, girls, don't she appear lovelier?  The maids assented, and Harriette, pleased by their looks of admiration, descended for her mother's inspection. Perhaps she wasn't thinking of iaint M/y'sstory--not she; she only wanted to please mamma and aunt Mary. - Bit while mamma is smiling through her tears at the sweet simplicity of her daughter, at which Harriette seemed quite contented, although -she might be considered rustic by some-her mother didn't 'know the story of aunt Mary's-we will pass a little higher up'on Greenwich street, and ^ intrude into another boudoir, only we won't be b-: visible, for the conversation held between mother and daughter is quite confidential. "That:is magnificent, Grace!" exclaimed Mrs. Guyman, who presided' at her daughter's toilet; "you  ill bear off the palm to-night; with all Harriette's finery, she cannot excel you. That braid behind is the most beautiful one H ever saw, notthat comb fits it precisely those sweet curls hng just low enough, and those silver leaves peep out sufficiently to form a fine contrast with their color., But, Grace, this splended back wreath will correspond with the front one, and the prim- 'orlslribbon tied under the knot of your hair, will suit your neck-band and sash, as well as your chain anid, bracelets, and the diamond head-band that ifsl  your fa lse- curls. Ah, that is it! look, id:i&t tier," and she led her to the mirror.   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    267 "I don't know what I should do without you, mother," said Grace, as she viewed herself with a self-satisfied air; I have no taste at all. If I triumph to-night, which this flatterer tells me I shall, I will thwnk you for my good fortune. I wonder if Frank Merton will be there." *   i "If invitations will draw him, you. may depend upon it; Harriette would have a Dutch fit if he should decline; any one may see how jealous she is of Lilia Roselv. . Poor Lilia! she is too simple to set up her pretensions there. Frank Merton would never think of her." "I don't know--he pays her very special at- tention," said Grace, curling her red lip. "I can't understand him." l"Yes, he pays her attention when you are near -he sits beside her, but his eyes are always on Yyou. Poor woman! she did n't know what a flame she-- was fanning in the bosom of her daughter, and so she rattled on, filling her young head as full -of nonsense as it was heavily laden with trash out- side ; and when Grace stepped into the coach that night, she thought in heart a more splendid crea- ture never would enter a ball-room more elegantly and tastefully decorated. Poor mother! Harriette was in high glee, that night, defendi ' herself to " young Rodman, who lived up on Broad-- way," for her plain appearance, on the score of her, mother's met/odical views, when the door opened and the detested Lilia Rosely entered the hall,   268      LILIA ROSELY; OR, escorted by " handsome Merton," and an elegant, Italian looking stranger, who was introduced as Col. Bentley. Harriette shook like a rose in a north-wester at this apparition; and well she might, for she had deceived her mother with regard :.sending9ilia the'" first' invitation; and although :s ie had written the note and dispatched it, yet she -.had ordered the:bearer not to deliver it, and retired -I fromi his presence. Just then her father came in, and seeing it, "in the hands of the footman, took it Troin him, saying he would deliver it in person, as he was then goingAto Lilia's boarding-house. Col. Bentley,:-who was a cousin of Lilia's, was present on the, occasion, and received a verbal invitation to be present on New Year's eve; but Harriette knew nothing of this, and who can wonder if she thought it all. srather green." Hbarriette's dress caused Grace's eyes- to look a littl hiter than usual, owing to their dimensions, and:she crossed over to her. - i;'-In:-the name of all that is good! said she, :"!hat^induced you to look so Quakerish!

"Did you ever know such a speedy revolution in any character?" said she, -looking t Harriette, who caught her eye, and appeared a:thing but amiable; " nothing but :changel in thi world,( s there?" "If all changes produced a similar effect, we} should have no cause to regret them,"-replied Lilia. "This is a happy change; I never saw her look so sweet and lovely, and I never loved her half so well, because I never formed a right estimate of her character." "Is it possible you think it a change for 'the bet' ter?" said Grace, feeling reproved; "why, she is ready to cry with vexation, because she yielded to her mamma's wishes, (ah, 'there's the rub,'; and Harriette wished heartily that that had been :l! that subjected her to the ridicule of her light-headed-I mean internally-companions,) and I think sher i" not recover to-night; see how cross she 1t;^ : " "She should not have been laughed:,:.f0rvher sacrifice," returned Lilia; "she is a noble giri, :dlyi a little spoiled by flattery; I will endeavor to con- sole her," and she seated herself beside Harriette, leaving Merton with Grace,'who thought -her-vite wreath was about to -triumph, when she Sgwl'him turn his eyes from the simply-adorned heads. of Lilia and Rarriette, to her grand one, with a smile something akin to contempt; (she didn't know -ie ,   270      LILIA ROSELY; OR, looked at hers first;) but, alas for her sweet ribbon and diamond band, he, too, crossed the hall, fol- lowed by Colonel Bentley, and the plain Harriette :;!;f found herself surrounded. Grace could hardly A credit her eyes when she saw EHarriette's face ra- diant withi leasure, and her delicate form, support- eby Colonel Bentley's arm, gliding noiselessly around the room, till at length, altogether acciden- 'tally, of course, he drew her to a retired seat in the recess of a window; and so she turned away with an air of nonchalance, and entered into a desperate flirtation with Mr. Rodmlan..  "Pray tell me, Miss Monkton,' said Colonel ,Bentley, "- who is that young lady yonder," mean- ing Gracel; 'and is she a particular friend of yours?" with an indefinable stress upon the word friend. i' 'Thtat is Miss Guyman," returned Harriette, be- giminning to feel a-little uncoimfortable as she looked 'at her 'splendid wreath and thought of her poor pitiful bud, "and she is a particular friend of mine -t -t'tis, one of my associates." I "I am glad to hear that last clause," said he; "for I cannot think there is much sympathy exist- ing between you, if appearance is any criterion by whichi we may judge of character. I never see a well-aden head, but I am naturally led to think of the internal vacuity," and his eye rested admiringly upon the sweet little bud that nestled -in stainless beauty among her rich curls. Harriette felt dreadfully confused, and blushed a   THE TRIUMPH. OF VIRTUE.    271 great deal, when she reflected that this was thefirst time Grace had ever excelled her in finery; but she didn't tell her companion so, nor rehearse the story of aunt IMary's, whom she now loved as heartn- ily as she had a short time before hated, for her in-- terference in her dressing-room. The evening passed delightfully with Harriette, in whose bosom a friendship- had sprung Up for' Lilia, quite as unaccountable to Grace, as her newly- acquired penchant for "'Quakerism," and Harriette would have forgotten that Lilia had not been in- vited, had not a remark of Bentley's refreshed her memory. "- shall never cease to be grateful to the Provi- dence that led me to an acquaintance with your father," said he, bestowing a glance upon her that suffused her cheek with a bright tinge, and he went on, till she gathered the whole truth of the mystery. tHarriette felt more angry with herself than -she had ever with another then, and in her hear tshe:blessed the Providence that had thwarted her mean pur- pose. "And this is the reward of my little-souled in- tentions," thought she, as she ascended to her cham- ber, after the breaking up of the company, to half- stifle aunt Mary with kisses; and in her humility the good spirit triumphed, and her. delighted mother had never more occasion to impute-to her injustice. "Wherb is your pretty bud, my dear?" said aunt Mary, as she assisted in disrobing her; "I declare,   "LA ROSELY.  you have lost it-what a pity; you should have preserved it as a memento of this happy night, which is the beginning of your new. life ;" for Har- riette had told her how she had enjoyed herself, and how sorry she was for having given so much pain to mamma by her thoughtlessness, and declared her resolution to lead a new life altogether. "Yes, indeed, it is gone," replied she, putting her little hand, that looked like a damask rose trembling in moonlight, to her head, as if seeking the lost treasure, and turning away that aunt Mary might not see the blush on her cheek. She knew very well where it was, for Colonel Bentley had requested it as a pledge of future friendship; but Harriette didn't care to tell aunt Mary then; she felt fatigued and sleepy, and aunt Mary woun  laugh at her for "rushing headlong into the sea," and with the assurance that it needed not that to remind her of this night, she fell asleep to dream of- we know not what, unless it was of aunt Mary's story, Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;  If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep.

BUT what of Grace? Ah, poor girl I her splen- did wreath looked as fresh and snowy as ever, when she entered her chamber that night, and stood before the mirror; but she was in no mood to ad- mire the beautiful then; and she tossed it from her with an air of disgust. Tired and dispirited, she threw herself on the bed, and burying her face in the pillow, desired to be left alone; and, with.a long-drawn sigh, as much as to say, "how shame- fully I am treated," her mother retreated from the room, leaving her to give free vent to an over- charged heart. Unhappy mother I with what truth she might have said, " It is the work of my hands." Poor Grace! she had seen the last bright star fade from the horizon of hope, and well might that young heart weep in darkness amid the ruins of its sweetest joys. And why? was she not beautiful and rich ? and had she not been flattered, courted, and admired? True; but Grace felt it was the homage of fawning sycophants to wealth and sta- tion, not the tribute of true hearts at the shrine of 12*    274   -    LT A ROSELY; OR, worth. Had Grace possessed a less noble mind, she would, have returned in triumph to her mother, escorted by the dashing Rodman, who was one of  those butterflies who bask in the rays of fortune, and court alone its favorites, to laugh over the metamorphosis exhibited in the appearance of Har- riette; but Grace's good sense told her it would be the height of folly to ridicule that which had won the respect and deference of a heart she would have given worlds .to secure. The noble Merton, who had stood aloof in- the meridian of her glory and ; triumphant sway, had been lured by her sweet sim- plicity to, render to Harriette the'homage due to her worth; and Grace felt as jealous of her as she had ever of Lilia, because poor Lilia had nought but a pure "mind and lovely face to win her way through the world; while, added to these, Harriette possessed the irresistible charm of gold, and, of course, Grace thought the most powerful magnet- would be the most attractive, without for a moment considering that the proximity of the less would counteract the influence of a more distantf; and while aunt Mary watched the smile on the rosy lip of-. Harriette, and felt that she had been the instru- ment of calling up such beautiful dream-visions, the unhappy Mrs. Guyman bent over the restless piI- lowq of Grace, and through her incoherent wander- ings, that told of a deep heart-sorrow, the misguided mother received the reward -of her folly in the un- happiness-of her child, for with all her faults she possessed a mother's heart.   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.     275 The next morning, Grace received a visit from Miss Wilee, a very beautiful creature with azure eyes and jetty ringlets, who might, with all pro- priety, have been compared to the leopard, for ex- ternal appearance and-disposition. "My dear Grace," cried she, coming into the dressing-room where Grace sat en dishabilk, "how miserable you appear this morning, which is not at all astonishing, considering the dull affair last night; did you ever know anything so absolutely lifeless?" Now it must be confessed that Miss Wilee- had exerted all her powers to entrap Mr. Merton the night previous, and that her ill success had ren- dered her as jealous of Lilia Rosely, as Grace was of Harriette. "It zoas dull," assented Grace, leaning back in her chair, and wishing Miss Wilee any where but there. "And that Lilia Rosely," continued Miss Wilee, "she is the most-soulless, inanimate creature in the universe. I wonder Harriette invited her; I know she never liked her until last night, when there seemed to spring up, most unaccountably, a won- derful 'intimacy between them; but I suppose it was to answer some end which Harriette has in view; you know she is an artful creature." ' And the best skilled in the world," exclaimed Grace, taking fire at the mention of Harriette's name; " did you observe her dress, and what an effect it produced on Mr. Merton? Depend upon   276       LILIA ROSELY. it, we shall never see anything but rose-buds and simple robes henceforth." Grace should not have said so much, for she had resolved she would hereafter accommodate herself to the different tastes of persons ; but alas, for poor human nature I when it begins wrong it cannot be expected to end right, and so Grace and Clara talked on, the best friends in the world, deprecia- ting the absent, and winning each the other's jeal- ousy. Had Mr. Merton fancied either of the young ladies, the rejected one would have despised the other in her heart; but --they had nothing to fear from each other, and of course they were the best of friends. Grace had never felt much attached to Clara, for she knew her to be not very amiable. Mrs. Wilee was a cold-hearted, soulless woman, re- gardless of everything but display, and it could not be expected that Clara should be otherwise; but Mrs. Wilee could not be reproached as having spoiled her daughter--she was so from the begin- ning.

INTER, spring, and summer,-had passed away, T and New York was enlivened by the return )of those who had retired from the dull, heavy at- mosphere of the city, to the salubrity of the fresh country air; but ere we establish them   in their city residences, we will visit them once at their retreat. The sun was just going to sleep behind the white fleecy sheet that spread across the western heavens, and Lilia Rosely sat in a window watching the golden shafts, that ever and anon darted between the silver folds of the tinged curtain that obscured it, as it slowly sank to its rosy bed, wholly uncon- scious of all that was transpiring around her, until the door opened, and a tall, handsome man, of most noble mien and benignant contour of features, en- tered the. hall.  We have only to watch the deep- ening rose on the sweet cheek of Lilia, dear reader, to be assured that one was Mr. Merton; for Lilia [277]   278   -  LILIA ROSELY; OR, never blushed at the sound of any other foot-fall, and she could distinguish that one from all others. Grace and Clara, Harriette and Colonel Bentley, were all there, for Grace and Clara'declared they could not be separated from dear Harriette and Lilia, and they must assuredly visit at the same watering-place. Grace an'd Clara looked daggers at the bloom on Lilia's cheek, and very pleasantly remarked that her health had improved vastly since she left New York, which confused Lilia very much to find her sensitive heart had betrayed her. To screen her- self, she leaned out at the window, just as a very handsome man was passing it. He came up on observing her, and offered to her acceptance a beautiful white rose-bud. - Lilia blushed a -good deal as she- took it, for she thought it might appear as though she had inten- tionallyiarrested his attention. With some pleasant and graceful remarks he passed on, having first engaged her for a party the next evening, for it must be remarked that she was not yet engaged to Mr. Merton, and therefore could not, with the slightest excuse, decline; but Lilia felt exceedingly mortified by the circumstance, and wished, for the first time in her life, thatrMr. Merton had remained absent a few moments 'lo;er. "How very much you prize that sweet bud," said -Clara, as Lilia sat with it to her lip, unconscious of so doing; "you haven't ceased to press it to your lip since Dr. Clayton left."   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    279 Lilia raised her eyes at this, and they met the earnest, inquiring gaze of Merton, upon whose cheek not the least color was. "You know my passion for white buds," answer- ed she, trying to rally her spirits; " and I prize this only because of that fact." "Dr. Clayton appears to be well aware of your preference," continued Clara;'" that withered bud in your braids was given you by him yesterday." "Which must be sufficient evidence of my par- tiality," answered Lilia; "could I have obtained a fresh one, I should not have preserved this so care- fully." Grace gave her a quizzical look, having first taken care that Merton should observe it; then seeming to feel abashed at the detection, with a light laugh left the room. The evening wore away rather heavily to all but Grace and Clara, who were unusually animated, and laughed at Mr. Merton until they succeeded in wiling him away from the vicinity of Lilia, who was far from spirited; for, poor Lilia : there was a weight upon her heart, that rendered her most un- happy; and   Merton, misconstruing her silence, partook of her feelings, and the presence of each was a burden to the other,' Oh, surely, "The course of true love never did run smooth." Dr. Clayton was announced after tea, and took the vacant seat of Merton, to the inconceivable chagrin of Lilia; not that she disliked him, for si A   280      LILIA ROSELY he was a most worthy man; but lilia would much have preferred being left alone, for her head ached badly, and she felt averse to conversation, but courtesy demanded the sacrifice. Lilia had another reason for wishing this; she had scarcely spoken to Merton since the conversation about the rose- bud-a reserve had gradually stolen over both, which she could not shake off, for she felt that Mer- ton might misjudge' her conduct, which she would gladly have explained, had he given her an oppor- tunity, but he seemed determined to preserve ob- mutescence; and what could she do? Poor Lilia I! Merton's attention appeared to be wholly ab- sorbed by Grace and Clara, but his eye would wander to Lilia and Clayton, who sat apart from the rest of the company, and as he saw a deep blush suffuse her cheek, just at the moment her eye caught his, he rose quickly and left the room, though not before he saw Dr. Clayton replace the withered bud in her hair with -a fresh one. That night her pillow was moistened with the dew of an aching heart, and the morrow's sun rose upon her unclosed eyelids.     CHAPTER V.

SHAKSPEARE. WE will now follow them to their city homes, and   attend a party given by Mrs. Wilee, in honor- of her daughter's eighteenth birth-day. Har- riette and Colonel Bentley were there, and report said they were to be wedded in a short time. One thing we know; Harriette had told aunt Mary all about the rose-bud, and aunt Mary had patted her cheek, and said it was a  "precipitate" affair, but one which "the   least worthy would imbibe the purity of its superior ;" and Harriette laughed, and said her mamma was right in saying we could not apply opprobrious epithets to one we truly love. It was late before Lilia entered the brilliant hall, and   when she came, leaning on the arm  of her brother, all eyes turned with astonishment upon them, for it was the first time Lilia had appeared at a  party without Mr. Merton. All1 did I say? no, I meant not that, for Grace and Clara looked quite indifferent; they knew all about it. (281)   282      LILIA ROSELY; OR, Lilia's cheek was very pale, and the company thought her country residence had not contributed to her appearance. Mr. Merton came soon after; but he too, looked pale and dejected, and assidu- ously avoided, Lilia; and,scandalous whispers went round -the room, having first started from Grace and Clara. Lilia was -dressed& in a simple white robe, without a single ornament; her hair was smoothly braided and confined by a silver comb, and what; was most unaccountable to, some who knew her best, not a single bud nestled amid its darkl- braids.    - This circumstance was commented upon in the presence of Dr. Clayton, who rose immediately, and taking a beautiful, unfolding, snowy bud from a stand near by, carried it to Lilia. He presented it gracefully, but she did not directly observe him. She started abruptly, when she became aware of his object, and motioned him back, as if fearful of touching it. " hate flowers!" cried she, unconscious of the horror depicted in her countenance, or the construc- tion that might be placed upon her words-"I haven't touched one for years." "You haven't touched one for years!" reiterated Dr. Clayton, in consternation. "You wander, Miss Rosely; 'tis but a few weeks since you accepted one from me." "Oh, I had forgotten," said Lilia, as if awaken- ing from a dream; " but I have lived years since then," she added, seeming to speak mentally-   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    283 wholly unconscious that envious hearts were trem- bling with delight, to gather somewhat whereby they might crush her-to the earth. "Do accept this," persisted Dr. Clayton, placing it in her hank. She shrank back, and suffered it to fall upon the floor. Mr. Merton sprang forward, lifted it from the carpet, and threw it into the street, with flashing eyes. Murmurs went round and round, and Lilia found herself acting in quite a scene. "Pray tell me the cause of your newly-conceived prejudice against a flower that was recently so de- cided a favorite," said Clayton, stationing himself beside her. "I loved white roses when I believed in friend- ship,' answered she. "I once thought white buds typical of some hearts; but circumstances have convinced me that human nature partakes more the dye of the crimson rose,. than the purity of the white;" and her eye glanced towards Grace and Clara, who blushed and turned quickly away, pre- tending they had not heard her. "And you reckon all hearts alike!" said Clay- ton, looking earnestly at her; " do not place me on the crimson list; I deny the imputation of change- ableness.'" "Every one will," said Lilia, " every one is true and faithful till the test -comes-then it is--' Mene, kIene, Tekel, Upharsin. ' "I am utterly confounded," cried Clayton, " to hear you speak-thus; I thought your whole nature   284      LILIA ROSELY; OR, was love, and that you could. not exist without its balmy atmosphere." '"When existing in the sunlight of friendship," answered she, " we think we could not walk with- out; but when it is obscured by the blackness of disappointment, the darkness renders us totally cal- lous to what may surround us, and misanthropy makes us rejoice even in our loneliness." "Good heavens!" cried he, starting in evident surprise--" you surely do not mean this-you can- not!7' "You discover we are all liable to change!" said Lilia. "Your astonishment plainly declares you could not have believed me capable of it." "I cannot believe it now,"' said he-" for once you say what you do not believe; you are deceiv- ing yourself, Miss Rosely." "-You may think so," added she--" but the time may come, when you, too, will doubt the sincerity of all friendships." Metton sat a silent observer of this conversa- tion, pretending to be wholly absorbed by a book he held before him; but he forgot to turn over a leaf, thus inducing the belief that he was either a very slow reader, or a very inattentive one; but as Lilia uttered the last words, he rose and hastily re- tired from the hall. Whispers floated about, after his exit, quite detrimental to the fame of Lilia; who sat with stoical indifference to all around her. The girls drew back, farther and farther, till she was left entirely alone, with the exception of Harriette,   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    285 who clung to her during the evening. Week after week went by, and Lilia heard of parties being given by those who had never before slighted her, but no invitations came to her. Poor Lilia! well might she distrust the reality of friendship. She heard of a splendid affair about to be gotten up at Mrs. Guyman's, but she gave it no heed, for she felt quite sure she would be omitted in the in- vitations, for Grace and Clara had not called upon her since the party at Mrs. Wilee's; but strange to tell, an invitation did come, with a very affection- ate little note from Grace, begging she would not fail on the specified evening. Lilia would have de- clined, but her brother, her nearest relative, a proud, hot-headed, but withal, noble-hearted young man, of two-and-twenty, declared in positive terms she should go, merely to confront those who had insult- ed her, and consequently sent an answer to that effect. Let us go back a little, and investigate this mys- tery. Grace and her mother held. a long confab about the propriety or expediency of inviting Lilia, who owed her good fortune, if we may so term it, for the end proved it so, to the fact that Mr. Mer- ton had never attended a party where Lilia was not, and they knew he had special invitations, so they decided accordingly. This was the whole sum of the mystery. Well, it came at last, and with it Lilia, her brother, and the long secluded Merton. Lilia was dressed in white satin; chain, bracelets, and dia-   286      LILIA ROSELY; OR, mond circlet, that shone brilliantly amid the dark braids of her glossy hair. Not a single bud or delicate flower, indicated that softness of soul that had heretofore characterized her, but she had never looked so brilliantly beautiful.' There was a bright crimson spot on either cheek, that gave a radiance to her Splendid hazel eye, and a most touching deli- cacy to her transparent cheek. tHer slight form looked frail as a lily-stem drooping in an autumn blast; and as Merton's eye followed her, as she moved around the room on the arm of Dr. Clay- ton, there was a something in his heart that seemed to say he had contributed to the unhappiness of one he loved above all earthly beings; but he would question the possibility of this, since Lilia had re- jected his love; and how could he add to her sor- row? he would ask himself, without receiving a satisfactory reply ; and the mournful glance of her eye, whenever he casually caught it, made him truly miserable. ;Dr'. Clayton was untiring in his attentions to Lill, and some of the dashing beaux, dazzled by her transcendent loveliness, wishing to show off to adavantage by engrossing her-attention, were heard to' apply the term "monopolizer," in reference, to him. Clayton overheard it, but knowing the shal- lowness of[ the source, deigned no reply, nor yield- ed his charge, but walked to a stand of roses, and laughngly offeredj Lilia a white bud. Before we proceed, it must be told that Clayton had proposed to Lilia, who had'declined the honor   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    287 of his hand; with the assurance that her affections were not at her own disposal, else her decision had been favorable to his wishes, and he was too honor- able to feel mortified or piqued by. her rejection of his suit; and being really attached to Lilia, he re- solved to promote her happiness, to the utmost of his power, even should it be by facilitating her union with another. This, reader, is what we term love- the pure love of a noble heart! and woe to Merton, had he acted dishonorably, for the comparison would have been fatal to his hopes. But Lilia learned from her cousin Bentley, that Merton had never appeared in company when she was absent; a circumstance' which rendered his conduct un- fathomable, which she longed for an explanation to elucidate. Poor Lilia I she knew not an explana- tion had been sought and received, which drove Merton nearly to despair; but there was one in that assembly who could have revealed the -secret of her brilliant cheek, and Merton's heavy, restless eye; but no marble statue was ever more soulless, and insensible to human kindness than that one. Merton managed to get near Clayton and Lilia as if by chance, and, without appearing to do so; overheard the conversation between them. Clara and Grace had nearly despaired of ever winning him to wear their chains, for he had dexterously escaped every snare to detain him at their side, and thus induce the belief that he was -a devotee at their shrine; and they now watched him with jealous eyes as he stood near the rosestand.   288      TALTA ROSELY; OR, "Do allow me to affix this where it would look so natural," said Clayton, holding up a pretty white bud; "there seems to me to be something wanting, without a bloom of Nature's in your braids." "No," said she; "place it where it will be em- blematical of the spirit-I claim no communion with the soul's sweetness; these diamonds better bespeak my nature." Merton turned quickly- towards her, involun- tarily, but averted his head ere her eyes met his; and conscious of having betrayed himself, walked hastily away, and sat down by Miss Wilee. "Can you tell me," said he to her, trying to speak composedly- "what disappointment Miss Rosely has recently met with?" "Dear me!" cried she; "is it possible you are ignorant of what has agitated the world? but you have lived so retired of late, that I do not wonder at this." "And pray, what may the agitation have issued from?" inquired he. "Why, from Col. Delly's marriage with Miss Morse," said she; "which you know was con- summated a short time previous to our return from the country." Merton pondered it over in his mind, and dis- covered it was precisely the time the change had appeared in Lilia. Clara went on' "'Tis said Lilia was devoted to him, and we really thought, at one time, it would be a match;   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    289 but he finally left her boarding-house, and at length married the daughter of his landlady. I know Lilia wept bitterly the night we were ap- prised of his nuptials, but I have never touched upon the subject in her hearing, from an unwilling- ness to pain her sensitive nature. Poor Lilia I no wonder she doubts all friendships;" and Clara brushed a tear from her pitying eye. Reader, dear, I cannot leave you to suffer from suspense as Merton did, but must tell you that Col. Delly was a rejected suitor of Lilia's--that to ban- ish her from his heart he had left the house where she boarded, and after -one year wedded Miss Morse, whose sweetness of manners reminded him of Lilia's gentle nature. Lilia heard of his mar- riage the day after the breach between her and Merton, and for what her tears were shed can readily be imagined. This was what roused the tenderness of Miss Wilee's nature, and induced her to drop -a tear for poor dear Lilia's unhappi- ness. Merton did not remain longer with Clara, after gathering this information, but retreated from the room.  Lilia saw him depart, and her head grew giddy with some new fear she could not define; for she saw him sitting with Clara, whose friend- ship she had every reason to doubt, and' she re- marked, also, the wildness of his eye as he went out. Clayton endeavored to prevail upon her to sit to the piano, but she positively declined, and begged Clara- to supply her place, which she readi- 13    290      LILIA ROSELY; OR, ly did, not from a desire to gratify her, but from a wish tAo display her skill as an amateur. The company gathered around the beautiful pianist, delighted by her sweet strains, and Lilia stole un- observed from the room. Her head ached, and she felt sick at heart, and now she prayed the time -would come for her -departure. Merton she thought already gone, and she ran along, uncon- scious whither, in her excitement; for she had turned down a dark passage, and in seeking a win- do w at the farther end, she ran against some one, whose arms immediately closed around her, and she was pressed closely to an unknown bosom. 4Release me!" cried she, struggling for freedom, and terrified by the action. "Pardon me," said the mournful voice of Merton -.. I could not resist so favorable an opportunity of bestowing a first and last embrace upon one whdm H may never more see one whom I have so long but hopelessly- idolized." "You have not offended me," said Lilia, laying her hand upon his arm; " but I thought you gone." Merton said- not a word, but drew her to the window, and by the pale light, that struggled through, their eyes met. What a world of thought and feeling may a single glance express; words could not have spoken half so eloquently, and the first, tears of joy that Lilia had ever wept were shed upon his bosom. Oh, could Grace have seen her there, she would have execrated the hour in which she solicited her presence. And Clara too;   l-n"TRlUMPH OF VIRTUE.    291 she was in the height of her glory, exulting in tile success of her well-devised plan for confirming the tenor of the infamous note she had written in reply to one from him to Lilia, which she had bribed from the servant during their residence in the country. Ah, poor Clara! how little did she then dream she would ere long be dragged from security to open confusion, by the very one Whom she had-so deeply wronged. A step was- heard in the passage, and Merton disappeared through  a  side door, leaving Lilia alone at the window. It was- Clara, who had missed her, and  as guilt is ever cowardly had' gone out to seek her, lest, as she declared, she should become a prey to melancholy, which was evidently seated in her bosom. Lilia went back with her, and  soon after Merton appeared also. Dr. Clayton resumed his place by the side of Lilia, and Merton stationed himself beside Clara, who cast a  look of triumpll towards Grace, whose ill- concealed displeasure rendered Clara more ami- able; and a more spirited creature never received the attentions of an admirer-of wit and beauty Dr. Clayton again begged Lilia to favor him with a song, and unhesitatingly she complied. "How very impulsive," he said, as she rose from the piano; "you seem to think there is such an motion as love yet extant--perhaps you will now ?ccept this bud, which was a   short time since - ejected."  "Certainly," said she, as she received it from e   292      LILIA ROSELY; OR, him and confined it in her hair; "'ou see-all things are subject to change, but none more liable than one whom you imagined inflexible." Clayton looked earnestly at her bright cheek and flashing eye, whilst a shade of distress flitted , across his fine brow, and then followed her eye, which-involuntarily glanced towards Aferton. None but he saw the smile exchanged between them, for the action was too quick to be easily detected; but he comprehended it all then. Poor Clayton I! strange that he had not before thought of Merton, for how could he believe Lilia loved one who had wedded'another? Clara had told him all about Col. Delly; but now he sighed as the conviction that she was forever lost forced itself upon his mind. Mr. Merton attended Clara home thlat night, and Grace cried with spite, until " tired nature's sweet restorer" lighted -upon her lids, just as she vowed vengeance upon her dear friend. Oh, friendship! Well, time winged away very pleasantly to all parties. Clara thought her plan had succeeded to admiration, and Grace thought she was the favored one, for Merton was constant in his attentions, and the mothers wondered, which of their daughters would be mistress of the elegant mansion that was being fitted up for the handsome and wealthy Mr. Merton. But now another excitement was produced by the marriage of Col. Bentley with Harriette Monk- ton. Merton escorted Clara -to the wedding, and   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    293 Grace sulked through the evening.  Lilia was there with her simple robe and white bud, but none thought of remarking hier appearance, she was so vacillating of late ;--all agreed on one point, that she was a very unaccountable girl. Tears trembled in aunt Mary's eyes as tEarriette was pronounced Mrs. Bentley, and papa and mam- ma smiled upon their bride daughter. It passed off happily to all but Grace, whose good humor was not restored until AMerton called upon her the next day, and requested her superin- tendence, in connection with Clara and the young ladies who had slighted Lilia, in preparing for a party at his newly-fitted house, which was to come off next week. Grace accepted it, and a merry time they had, for Grace and Clara both thought they were adorning their own home. All things were arranged in order, and the guests assembled at the hour; but Lilia was nowhere to be seen. Clara thought this all right, and her fine spirits diffused light and gladness through the assembly, until the door opened, and a little party, headed by Bentley and his bride, entered the hall, and, wonder- ful to tell, Merton among the number, leading a lady whose face was concealed by a white veil, that defied penetration. An aged minister came for- ward-the party halted, and oh, horror of horrors I! a marriage rite began, which was to unite Merton to the veiled unknown!  The ceremony ended. Harriette removed the bride's veil, and the eye of Lilia Merton rested upon the colorless cheeks of   29.4     LILIA ROSELY ; OR, Clara Wilee and Grace Guyman, who disappeared from the hall without congratulating the newly wedded. "My own at last - ' said Merton, as he stood upon the veranda, in the calm moonlight, with Lilia- folded fondly to his bosom; "no envious heart, or lip of falsehood, can ever separate us now; and he warmly pressed her lovely, smiling lip, while tears of love and joy filled her beautiful eyes as she nestled her blooming cheek upon his bosom. Grace and Clara' did not accompany Mrs. Mer- ton and Mrs. Bentley to the country that summer, but Dr. Clayton and a fair cousin of Harriette's- Miss Julia Monkton-did; and Dr. Clayton was heard to say how very much Miss Julia resembled Mrs. Merton ; and when it called forth the raillery of his companions, because of a' blue-eyed, fair- haired girl being reckoned like a brown-eyed, dark- haired woman, he felt somewhat confused, and con- fessed the resemblance was more in disposition than personal appearance. ' My dear Mrs. Merton," said Dr. Clayton, one day--" do initiate me into the mystery of such sentiments- as you once expressed concerning the reality of friendship." Mr. Merton smiled as he looked at Lilia, then handed, Clayton a copy of the note he had written her, and her reply dictated by Clara, the truth of which she had learned from her maid, who confess- ed her own guilt in the matter, won by the rich   THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.    295 bribes of Clara. In justice to Grace, we must say she knew nothing of this ; for although shb rejoic- ed at the breach between Merton and Lilia, she 'was naturally too noble-souled to have recourse to so mean a measure to effect it. Clara stood alone in the matter, and alone she bore the censure of all but Rodman, who, to obtain the golden frame, beautified his house "up on Broadway" with the picture.           -  "Pray, what is that?" asked Harriette of Lilia, as she was examining a white rose-bud in a golden case richly set with brilliants. "This," said Lilia, " is the first bud Frank ever gave me; you remember the party at Mrs. Guy- man's?" This was what Merton was in quest of, when Lilia called him back, which excited Harriette's wrath when our story commenced; and Harriette recalled her mother's words on that occasion- "never condemn precipitately." At Dr. Clayton's marriage with Miss Julia Monkton, Grace was present with a winged caterpillar, whom she after- wards wedded, through her mother's influence. In conclusion, dear reader, we will only say that the unions of Grace and Clara made them feel more keenly-Lilia Rosely's Triumph.    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. [97]   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER,   CHAPTER I. POOR thing! My heart echoed the words as I looked at the object of the speaker's compassion. She was miserably mangled, and her coarse garments crim- soned with the dark tide that-flowed from the wounds, while groans and sobs mingled with the screams of the frightened little ones clustered around her. "Hello I what's the fuss?" squeaked the cracked voice of an elderly gentleman, with an astonishing circumference, and head so small that it looked ashamed of being set up on the conspicuous end of so big a body. His short legs seemed indignant at the little progress they were only capable of- making at each successive stretch, and as if to make amends. for the narrow space to whichi-they were limited by nature, they plied with a velocity that brough:t him to the spot, puffing and blowing like a steam engine. In spite of the sad spectacle of the wounded woman and weeping children, a sensation out of    300    THE DRUNKARD S DAUGHTER. character with the time and place was aroused in the most sensitive region under my blue cape. I I never could forbear smiling at a rotund piece of humanity in big trowsers, with a short neck swal- lowed up by a mammoth coat collar, with a small breastpin in a wide frill, and watch chain, like the Atlantic cable, swinging far below his last vest button, with a-handful of heavy seals, keys and peach-seed baskets, nicely wrought out with a pen- knife, dangling at the end, in the ample folds of his double-fall pants. I'm always reminded, on behold- ing a corpulent frame of bones and sinews, of the Israelites whiping for the flesh pots of Egypt. "Thrown from  the wagon-leg broke- horse skeered by a drunken beast--going to market-- she's done for'--were snatches of information, gathered from the increasing-crowd, as Julia and I turned away from the awful scene, and resumed our evening walk. She was silent and deathly pale, as we rounded the corner of the city garden, and pro- ceeded slowly towards the green banks of the shining Potomac. She was very beautiful--just eighteen, and an. orphan. I wondered, secretly, as I watched her white, lovely face, and large, burning black eyes. I -thought of the poetic sentiment-" a heart to feel for others' woe," as I observed her sorrow-shaded, marble-like brow, and: small, compressed mouth, about which quivered an expression of acute pain. "Do you suffer so deeply for others' misfortune?" I asked with assumed lightness.   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER,    301 '-YES!" the little monosyllable was firm as granite and icy as the North Pole. I marvelled at the strange air and tone of the girl. "If you grieve for every calamity you witness in your life-march, you'll have your hands full, and soon be in a strait-jacket with your black curls-cut short off!" "And sooner the better. Lunacy is a night of years, and maniacs sleep through it, free from all sorrow." I crushed down my consternation, and suited my tone to the necessity of the case. "I don't know about that-and if it were true, I hope the Lord will permit me to walk into the un- known land across the mountains of mortalityv with the eyes of my intellect wide open, and not go stumbling through the dark. Eternity is too long, to think with complacency of tumbling into it with- out first looking through the spyglass of full con- sciousness, and knowing precisely where we're going to land when we let go the cordage of life's ship, and drop to the deck of the broad Beyond.

"I know our religious faith differs, Florence, but our' hearts are alike-time has evidenced that." "Yes, I love you just as well as though we had been christened at the same font, and taught by the same Gamaliel. It is impossible that all should think alike, from -the very nature of our constitu- tions, and it is absurd for one to say to another, be- cause of individual belief: 'I am more righteous than thou ;' and a religious persecution, or proscrip- tion of one sect; is' incontestible evidence that the very spirit is wanting that avowedly prompts the crusade or denunciation.'- A smile, like the faintest glimmer of star-light through a broken night-,cloud, flitted over her bent face, and lthe deep shadows closed over it again. I was perplexed by herunusual seeming, and mentally resolved to: unlock the shut door of that sorrow- filled heart.   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.    303 We had reached the terminus of our walk, and stood now upon the dusky edge of the Point beyond the Light-house, with the dark purple waters of the Potomac tinged afar with the red sunset rays,- sobbing up from the deep channel, and moaning and rippling among the rocks at our feet. The south winds made slumbrous melody among the thick leaves overhead, and far away flashed out the glittering spires of the various churce steeples in the last feeble spark of the day's extinguished fires. Above, around, beneath, all was subdued tenderness -earth was rocking her tired children to sweet repose, in the soft, curtained cradle of the Night, . with the drowsy chant of the winds and waves for a soothing lullaby. I never could stand in the solemn shadows of closing day, with the slumbrous breathings of in- fant twilight rippling up though the great hush of pensive Nature, without having the lachrymal foun- tain of the soul stirred and shaken up by an indefin- able feeling of sadness. ';--That is not akin to pain, And resembles sorrow, only, As the mist resembles the rain." I sat down on an old mouldering, moss-covered log, upon -the river's rim, and looked away down the wide, watery path cut through green ridges-of grass and bordering trees, with here and there a snow-white hut specking -the distant, hazy banks, to hide the .gathering tears, just ready to drop at the   304   THE DRUNKARDIS DAUGHTER. slightest shifting of the surcharged lids. I did not wish to add to her own heart-heaviness, by a symp- tonm of grief or melancholy in my seeming or tone, and tried to crush back the blinding spray dashed up by the troubled waters of transient feeling.- She nestled down, suddenly, half kneeling, upon a grass-clump beside me; crossed her white' bare arms upon my lap, and laid one round, roseless cheek against my shoulder. The quick action displayed a large, overladen tear, that, breaking from the sustaining lashes, fell heavily upon her hand, splash- ing: the small golden-hooped wrist, as the big drop burst.    - She started nervously, and gave me a wild, search- ing look, then dropping her face upon her arms, burst into a low, heart-mourning cry, mingled with spasmodic sobs and stifled moans. It was all over now-my self-control was scat- tered! to the four winds, and I wilted like the mimosa at the touch of rude hands. But philoso- phy soon came to the aid of second thought, and throwing my head back against an old tree-trunk, I broke into a loud, merrywlaugh. The effect was satisfactory. She lifted her wet face, and wiping off the shining tear-drops, looked her unfeigned astonishment. My assumed gayety was rendered-real by her confounded expression. "If I ever wear a strait-jacket and short hair, it'll be after, you, I'm thinking!" she remarked, dryly. "And if I ever get into a Lunatic Asylum, I'll   THE DRUNARD'S DAUGHTER.    .305 laugh them all off the premises if they wear your face "  "I believe you would laugh if the earth's roof should cave in and crush three-fourths of humanity ; you are the strangest girl in creation.

I saw there was some mystery in the sad affair-something that concerned her person- ally, and my curiosity and interest were aroused. I maintained a lively aspect, to compass the desired end, and lightly responded: "No! your unappreciative soul is at fault. I laughed at that old gentleman with the little head and big chain, and wondered if there were more sympathy under his breast-pin than could be got into the seed-basket dangling by his watch-key!

She raised her wet Hlack eyes to mine, with an earnest, silent gaze.   306    THE DRUNIKARD'S DAUGHTER. "I half envy you your happy disposition, Florence; but then you have never had cause to wish the last beam 'of your life might fade out in the western horizon'of mortality, like the pale glimmers of this beautiful twilight, and the night of death fold your weary-heart away from the sorrows and sufferings of this sinful world "-her head dropped upon my shoulder, and a grieving sigh sobbed up from the young breast, that locked in a secret sorrow. "Havent1 I Could you go with me to a far-off yard, where the weeping-willows wave their long fringes in the solemn hush, and the evergreens pencil their feathery leaves, in the dim light, upon white sto0nes that sentinel the last long sleep of mother, sisters and brothers, and one who would have been nearer- than all, had not a fearful .scourge swept him into eternity in the first flush of manhood-and hear the heart-wails- that have sobbed out, in the sombre-shadows, and could number the bitter tears that the cold earth has swallowed up in that weird, memory-haunting spot, then you would not think I have no cause for sorrow." "Poor child!"--she clasped her slender arms around my waist, and her expressive face told the sympathy of her affectionate soul. "How can you laugh and be merry; with a sable-draperied picture of ruined hopes looking down' upon you from the walls of long-gone years?" "-How I Look-do you see that?" "Whlat?' "The bright stars and the clear blue sky."  -   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.    307 "Of course-what's that to do with the sub- ject?" "A great deal-in fact, everything. I 'smile at fortune, battle on,' because I know that spangled azure is only a thin veil drawn over the glorious land, where those I love have gone before, and are resting securely from all ' the'ills that flesh is heir to;' and the hope that when the little span of earth-life is measured upon the sands of Time, I shall part that blue veil with my spirit-wings, and pass, through the gate of pearl, to the golden city of the great King, and meet the loved ones safely landed there, never more to be dissevered, makes me laugh at the petty plagues of human probation, and bid defiance to the things that must have an end." "Ah! you have hope for those you love, while I have none!" she hid her white face and sobbed- - "If there were one dear to your heart as its own life-tide, of whom you could cherish no hope in this world nor the one to come, who, though living, is worse than dead-would you smile and philosophize then?" 4' My dear girl, while there is life there-is'hope. I should never despair of a loved one, howeyer degraded and seemingly lost, so long as a spark of vitality glimmered through the windows of the soul's tabernacle, and it is written that- "Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners," even the " chief." Despite all circumstances, there is a receipt for being always happy, that I learned in time agone, and can quote from memory, if you   308    THR DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. would hear it. If it benefits you half as much as it has me, then bit was not written in vain. I have treasured it up in my Bible as an apple of gold in a picture of silver." "What is it?" "An 'Italian bishop, who had struggled through many difficulties, without repining, and been much opposed without manifesting impatience, being asked by a friend to communicate the secret of his being so happy, replied: 'It consists in a single thing, and that is, making a right use of my eyes.' His friend, in surprise, begged him to explain his meaning. ' Most willingly,' replied the bishop. 'In whatever state I am, I, first of all, look up to heaven, and remember that my first great business is to get there. I then look down upon the earth, and call to mind how small a space I shall soon fill in it. I look abroad- in the world, and see what multitudes are in many respects less happy than myself. And thus I learn where true happiness is placed, where all my cares must end, and how little reason I ever-have to murmur, or be otherwise than thankful. And to listen in this spirit, is:to be al- ways happy."'  "I wish I had your faith, Florence." "You may have as great, if you will." "How?" "Try to believe. 'To him that hath, shall be given; ask, and you shall receive.'" "Ah! it is harder for some than others. You can't comprehend how difficult it is for me.?

"Never mind, it's as true untold as related. You will hear it now, after the- distressing occurrence of this hour, from some source, and I would rather you should learn it from one who will-give an un- exaggerated version; for tales, like melting snow, increase in size and impurity, by being rolled over the earth. Did you see the 'drunken beast' who occasioned that dreadful calamity, Florence?" "I saw a miserable wretch, in rags and filth, reeling off in the custhdy of officer Nabb. Was that he? I gave him but one glance, he was so disgusting. I hate the very sight of a brandy- bloated, fuddle-brained imitation of manhood. I despise a red-eyed drunkard so intensely, that I'd turn my back upon a brother, and run, if he were so mean as to guzzle-down the poisonous liquid that even a swine wouldn't condescend to imbibe. Augl I it creates a nauseating sensation under my neck- lace, to see a bipedal formation in boots and breeches, running a worm fence on the side of the road to eternity, I wonder the earth don't open and swallow up such contemptible, sickening, good- for-nothing myths of humanity,? as quickly as it once did IKorah and his company." I secretly watched the effect of this outhreak   310    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. upon her expressive face. She grew livid with emotion, and her pale lips compres'sed more firmly. I saw"I had sent a dagger to her young heart, but why I could not divine. She was the only child of parents that had passed away ere I knew and learned to love her. I waited impatiently for the promised revelation. She was gazing steadily at Venus, lying .round and full in the soft blue folds of slumbrous twilight. "No you wouldn't, Florence." "What?" "Scorn one you once loved, for the sin of inebri- ety." "How'do you know?" "By the nature that God has given you--you have a soul like hers." "Whom?" "Poor Mary!" "It wouldn't be well to test me, I'm thinking. Augh!. could you esteem and love a sputtering, staggering, human demijohn?" "Under some circumstances, I think it is possi? ble-indeed, I know she loves him, even the miser- able being for whom you express such disgust; and it is for her sake and her lover, that I sometimes think it would be a blessing if a suffering heart could forget, in the'night-of lunacy, the agonies of the day of life. You marvel that I should feel so deeply for another's misfortune-we have an hour to dark-I will tell you the wretched story of The Drunlkard's Daughter."   -           "   CHAPTER II. "In this degenerate age, men estimate character by a cash-balance." IT was a blue and breezy May morning, when Henrv Raymond and his beautiful young bride entered their pretty and pleasant cottage home on street.- It was, indeed, a " sweet home," white and modest in physiognomy, set down amid thick shadow-weaving maples, and clambering vines, that wrought lattice-workaround the cool little portico, and low, wide windows. A snow white paling shut in the grassy, flower-hemmed yard, and beyond the cozy cottage, you might catch, through the dark breezy hall and lace-veiled windows, sweet glimpses of the luxuriant garden, with its winding, pebbly walks and sea of fragrant blossoms floating upon an undulating surface of deep green billowy leaves. Nina R-,mond, the frail bride, was just blushing into womanhood-fair as a lily of the valley, and modest and unassuming as a meek spring violet. Her soft, heavenly blue eyes, clear anrd liquid as a cloudless June sky, looked melting tenderness through long, curving black lashes, upon her hand- some and manly bridegroom, and clustering curls [311] ,'r   312    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHT'IR. of richest hazel hue, rippled in silky clouds over plump shoulders of spotless purity, and round trans- parent cheeks, that wore only the delicate tinge of the wild rose save when sensibility painted them a richer red. Henty Raymond's black eyes grew brighter, and his tall graceful form dilated with proud exultation, as he looked upon the fair prize he had borne off in triumph from so many bold aspirants, richer in worldly goods, but not more noble, than himself. His wooing had been attended by many doubts and fears, owing to ambitious and mercenary parents, and now that the object was attained, he appreci- ated it more fully, because of difficulties he had encountered and surmounted in accomplishing the desired end. Nina's parents, though aspiring and avaricious, were devoted to their beautiful child, and through solicitude for her failing health, the effect of oppo- sition in her dearest desires, they yielded a reluc- tant consent to her marriage with Raymond, and saw her go forth from her early home, to meet tile responsibilities, and perform the duties, of a wife, with no fear for her future happiness, but deep regret that she had not chosen one whose pecuniary circum- stances would have elevated her to a loftier social position. Nina's girl-heart had been won by the no- bleness of Henry Raymond's soul, combined with the beauty of his person and evident devotion, and love in a cottage was far preferable to her pure mind, to splendor of surroundings and unsatisfied affections.   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.    313 Years passed quietly and prosperously away, and a little trio, of which Mary was the eldest, flitted and frolicked through the white cottage, and tracked the neat flower-beds of the blooming old garden, to the offence of Nina's well developed organ of order. Mary inherited the dark eyes, raven curls and intrepid spirit of her father, and grew, with years, into a beautiful and graceful girl, the admiration of the opposite sex, and envy of her own. Her fifteenth birth-day was celebrated in an elegant mansion, filled with the Elite of the city, in a style comrporting with the wealth and high station of the man who sixteen years previously had wedded the gentle Nina Rivers, to the chagrin of her proud, ambitious parents, simply because of his moderate means. Fortune had smiled upon the man of perseverance and integrity, and the moneyed aristocracy,- who once passed him haughtily by, without deigning even a nod of recognition, now courted his society,- and esteemed it a privilege and honor to enter his stately home upon terms -of friendship and equality. Brainless and soulless, they ran, at the ring of his silver bell, and flattered and fawned-little-souled sycophants, at the shrine of dollars and cents-and tagged behind him everlastingly, like lean dogs scenting a Coat-tail plethoric with some odorous substance calculated to appease insatiable greed. Henry Raymond well knew they worshipped his golden calf, and flocked around him from the seven principles that actuate the meanest of God's crea- tures, viz : five loaves and two fishes--yet met their " :r',   314  a THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGH'tIR. cringing civilities with gentlemanly return, when he would not have trusted them with a half-dime to drop into a contribution box. He looked upon them with supreme contempt, knowing them to be human flies, who swarmed around him merely to suck the sweets of prosperity from his golden cup, and would leave him to famish with hunger, should a shock of adversity devastate his immense posses- sions. Nina's parents now regarded their opulent son- in-law with proud affection; and submitted to -his judgment and suggestions with all the deference that sordid minds ever pay to wealth-- and station. They congratulated themselves upon having yielded their will to her desire, and commended her choice as heartily as they had once opposed it; andi'simply because Henry Raymond, though the same being,  morally and intellectually, had -pried open the +  oaken heart of the world with a wedge of perish- ing gold I Surely, if there is one niche in the torrid zone of Eternity that admits of the superlative degree of the adjective hot, it is reserved, by a just and sin- avenging God, for the mean and contemptible worshippers of Iammon.

Mr. Raymond was now called by the brazen lungs   THE DRUNKARD S DAUGHTER.    315 of the fortune-hunting community, from the quiet and obscurity of his former years, to the conscience- hardening, dissipation-tending arena of political life, and rode triumphantly into the State Legis- lature upon the high back of popular favor, that the assessment of his real and personal estate alone en-  abled him to mount. Though a public speaker, on patriotic and benevolent occasions, from his youth to the period of his nomination, yet his oratorical powers were never discovered to be of a superior order, until a golden halo, reflected from his accu- mulated thousands of double eagles, encircled his brow, upon which the groveling progeny of Demas had written "THE PEOPLE'S CANDIDATE!" He had been taught " temperance in all things," from early childhood, by a pious mother, and in humble life had faithfully practised her precepts; but during his electioneering campaign, he had con- formed to the custom of the times, and thrown off the restraints imposed through- long and peaceful years, by principle and early instruction. He had even committed some petty absurdities, during partial intoxication, which were received with up- roarious applause, by the money-honoring crowd and 'capital fellow ' ' perfect brick!" three cheers- for Raymondl' ' hurrah!'--burst simultaneously from the admiring audience-while 'put him out F! low rascal!" down with the brute!' greeted another inebriate, from all quarters, on the same, occasion whose seedy coat and caved-in hat evidenced a desti. tution of the means thatjustified the rich man in any ,1 * t' r   316    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. excess and absurdity! And the poor drunkard was hustled off, between two rough officers, to maintain order, while the wealthy wine-bibber reeled out -of the crowded hall, leaning familiarly on the -arm of a purge-proud citizen, to obviate the probability of gravitating to the first floor, down the long stair- case, in a horizontal position, to the peril of his opu- lent person, and was conducted safely to his aristo- cratic residence by'the obsequious friend (to his possessions /)whose thin nose would have done more than his sordid heart ever did-viz-: looked heaven- ward-:as he strided superciliously by, had he met his precious charge in his present condition sixteen years ago. Henry Raymond bade adieu to his happy little home circle, for his first term at Richmond, and the peace, prosperity and contentment that had char- acterized the past years of his wedded life, never again brightened and blessed his domestic hearth.   CHAPTER. III. "Where ignorance is bliss 'tisTfolly to be wise." HARLES PERCY was the only son of the opu- J lent citizen who manifested so great solicitude. for Mr. Raymond's safety on the occasion alluded to in the last chapter; and as Charles was a suitor for the hand of Mr. Raymond's lovely and wealthy daughter Mary, his consideration and tender care; of the intoxicated father might reasonably be at- tributed to selfish motives, particularly when in that. father's years of poverty, Mr. Percy, senior, had disdained to recognize him as-even a common acquaintance. Indeed, Henry Raymond, in retr0- specting his past life, recalled to memory the time when he had received an indignity from Charles' paternal relative, of mushroom-aristocracy-extrac- tion and belonging, who, ignorant as the beast thiat Baalam rode on his journey to Balak, and of vevy close affinity to said animal in character andde- portment, neglected no opportunity to endeavor to impress an inferior in wealth with an overwhelm-, ing sense of his superiority and grandeur, without an atom of regard for gentlemanly bearingor indi-. vidual feeling. (317) *i.          c 4-    318    THE DRUNKARD' S DAUGHTER. Mr. Percy's literary attainments had never ex- itended beyond simple division, and Murray's rules for spelling and writing correctly were as much Greek to the purse-proud gentleman, as the commu- nication traced upon a chip was to the aboriginal Indian during the early period of our country's history. His ignorance of Webster, and things "generally," was so intenie and startling, consider- ing his pecuniary circumstances and proud claims to the highest seat in the synagogue of upper ten- dom, that he had absolutely been heard to remark, with all the dignified gravity and importance of a self-sufficient ignoramus; that the situation of a cer- tain patient was utterly hopeless, " as the doctor had positively decided that he had a spine!" And the irrepressible smile that appeared upon Mr. Raymond's fine face, on that occasion, con- duced to the attempted insult (for it was a matter of impossibility to; insult Henry Raymond, who heartily endorsed the sentiment of Cowper: "An honest, liberal, and well bred man, Will not insult me, and no other can," of the poor, intellectual man, from the rich numb- scull. -But now the scorned of other years could com- pete in wealth and magnificence with the mean- minded money-hugger, and he courted and caressed the highly favored son of capricious fortune, with the blissful hope of uniting the two aristocratic houses by the silken cord of matrimony.   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGH'TER.   319 Mr. Raymond comprehended his motive, and smiled, pityingly, at the meanness of his sordid soul, yet he was too noble-hearted to suffer the events of the past to interfere with his child's hap- piness, and sanctioned her betrothal to Charles, knowing that her young heart was wholly in the keeping of the estimable son of so stupid and grov- elling a father. Charles Percy was one of those rare specimens of manhood who united personal beauty with high mental endowments. and acquirements, and was as unlike his leaden-brained slovenly progenitor in physique and morale, as it is possible for imagina- tion to conceive. His unpardonable ignorance inspired him with an insatiate thirst for knowledge, and his mean cupidity and sycophancy enlarged and ennobled his young, indignant soul, in exact. ratio with his in- creasing perceptions of the littleness and contempt- ibility of his greedy and grovelling nature. It was a matter of as- much surprise to the discriminating portion of the community, who entertained the be- lief in hereditary transmission, to find one so intel- lectual and estimable spring from so insignificant and morally stunted a stock, as it was to the Israel- ite in whom there was, no guile, to see something good come out of Nazareth. In Charles Percy were developed the higher elements of character, that, by proper culture and judicious training, might have eminently qualified his weak-minded father for the exalted social posi-   320    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. tion to which his wealth alone had elevated him, and which he filled with about as much grace as an ourang-outang would a royal throne. To those who repudiate the doctrine of heredi- tary transmission, a more powerful argument could not be adduced in support of their heterodox views, than the virtues and intellectual superiority of such a son, in striking contrast with the antipodaI char-, acters of such parents, (for Mrs. Percy was the precise counterpart, in mind, of her liege lord, and the only piece of advice she had ever been known to follow faithfully, was "take care of the pennies, and the pounds will take care of themselves," only Mrs. Percy had improved upon the maxim, and never lost sight of the greater in supervising the less.) What they would have been by mental culture and energetic exercise of the superior order of feel- ings, was demonstrated in their son, for the estab- lished Tact of man's free-agency refutes the argu- ment that human nature is ever so destitute of latent powers and embryo goodness, as to inca- pacitate one of God's creatures-rationally born- from  rising' from the slough of mundane meanness, and cutting its way, heroically, through a phalanx of ignorance and constitutional besetments, with the glittering sabre of moral courage, and intellec- tual might; else " the dear God who loveth, us, who. made and loveth all," were unjust in holding us responsible for what we are incapable of resist- ing or-performing.   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.    321 Mr. Percy gloried in Charles' triumph over the many suitors of Mary Raymond, and demeaned himself with so much tenderness towards the art- less and credulous girl, that he quite won her young, unsuspecting heart, and her pure love cover- ed his multitude of sins. Had a Gipsey oracle fore- told the agony of soul his hypocritical pretensions and mean cupidity would occasion her in coming years, she would have laughed merrily at the wild and absurd prediction. "*   CHAPTER   IV. ' He ihat soweth'the Wind, Shall reap the whirlwind." TR.

The splendor that prosperity had (322)   THE DRUNKARD!S DAUGHtlER.   323 showered around her since that humble but happy time, mocked the great agony of the true heart that; walked amid its unsatisfying brilliance 'back to the beautiful, blessed years smiling up like green isles lying far away in the broad blue Ocean of the past. Henry Raymond, the gifted and noble-hearted, like thousands who had gone before him, sank lower and lower in the scale of morality and-virtue, as the passion for intoxicating beverages grew upon him day by day. His powers of resistance seemed wholly subverted, and in one year from the day of his nomination, he had acquired the unenviable and shameful reputation of being " a confirmed drunk- ard "  His business -matters ,were confided to i clerks and hirelings, and supervisory neglect speed- ily told a sad tale of his pecuniary affairs.

Others far less substantial, withstood the shock, and looked with amazement upon the mighty wreck of the rich man's shattered barque, drifting upon the subsiding waves of a stringent monetarial epoch; and the last end of Henry Raymond's eighteen years of wedded life was worse than the first. in every point of view--pecuniary, social and   324    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. moral. Mr. Rivers' pride received a stab, by this sad and, sudden reverse of circumstances, from which he never recovered, and as- Mrs. Rivers had passed away in the richest flush of her child's pros- perity, ere long Nina Raymond was parentless and penniless, with a husband whose increasing aban- donment and unkindness, the inevitable result of intemperance, made her weary soul yearn for a quiet resting-place beside them in the sombre grave- yard. The bridal day of Mary and Charles was fast approximating, when the great world was astounded by the unexpected failure of the wealthy and popular Mr. Raymond. Despite his degeneracy in morals, he was still sought and flattered by those who would worship a dime in a den of infamy, but immediately upon his reverse of fortune, like summer birds, they were gone, early, and came no more, with soothing strains of sympathy and friendship, to cheer his winter of poverty. In other years Mr.-Raymond would have smiled with pitying scorn at such an evidence of false- heartedness and sycophancy; but having basked in the golden sunshine of prosperity and -popular favor, and his strong mind having been weakened by dissipation, the sudden shutting in of the great light of social life, and toppling over of lofty posit tion, -operated disastrously upon his shattered nerves, and plunged-him recklessly forward into deeper exchss and degradation. Ah! Henry Ray- mnond had fallen far from the manly height he main-   THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.    325 tained in early years, when his pecuniary circum- stances were as moderate as now, and lihe went firmly forward in the discharge of duty, regardless of the neglect and indignities of the wealthy and worthless; and all because the venomous WORM of the STILL had sapped the green tree of moral cour- age, and withered the fresh, cool leaves of self-re- liance and inherent energy. Mr. Percy peremptorily forbade his son's union with the bankrupt's daughter, and disinheritance was the promised consequence of filial disobedience; but despite her changed circumstances, Charles Percy, with the soul of a true man, pleaded earn- estly, with all the ardor of a faithful lover, for the performance of her vow made in brighter and better days, when his soulless and sordid father was proud to acknowledge her as the betrothed of -his son. Mr. Raymond stormed at the proposition, and in a state of intoxication ordered Charles from his house, with the furious declaration that "he'd see him in hell before the son of that damned rascal should wed one of his daughters; and he'd k-ick the miserable old money-hugging villain to ever- lasting perdition, if he ever ventured within gun- shot of him, henceforth and forever-the mean old ignorant, grovelling lhypocrite!" He pronounced a fearful curse upon Mary, if she dared to marry in violation of his express com- mands. Mary Raymond had too much pride of nature to   326    THE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER. enter a family opposed to receiving her, and the misery of refusing Charles was added to the great burden of her domestic misfortunes. Believing that circumstances justified the deed, Charles urged an elopement, preferring poverty and obscurity, with the -object of his heart's first affec- tions, to affluence and worldly honor, without her ; buther father's awful curse held her firm to her purpose, and her sobbing refusal, and look- of un- utterable woe, silenced his passionate pleadings. Possessing a soul of intensest feeling, and an organ- ism, one of the most refined and delicate of nature's workmanship, the rude fingers of Fate, grasping the broken buds of his youthful hopes, pressed the slender strings of his mental mechanism too roughly, and soon Charles Percy was borne from his brilliant home, made desolate and  dreary by a father's cupidity, to Mount Hope Lunatic Asylum, from which he has never returned.   CHAPTER V. "The rich man down, you mark his favorite flies." THROUGH the influence of his wife and daughter whom he tenderly loved and caressed as in olden times, when not rendered insane and brutal by the poisonous liquid, Mr. Raymond removed to the country, at length, to escape the irresistible temp- tations that beset him on every hand, in the rum- dealing establishments that disgraced and polluted the place of his birth. For a time high -hopes were -entertained by the little loving home-circle, of his entire reformation, but in an evil hour he fell and shattered: the golden vase that held the brilliant blossoms of sweet anticipation that gladdened anid made happy the domestic hearth. Henry Raymond "resolved and re-resolved? to abandon his pernicious habit, and live henceforth for his heart-broken wife, and pale, toiling chil- dren; but relapse succeeded reform, until mania a potu was the final result of his inordinate indul- gence, and it became absolutely necessary to ren- s rav]   'HE DRUNKARD'S DAUGHTER.  der the Work-House his temporary residence, to obviate fatal consequences in his own humble home. Intemperance effected a perfect transformation of his natural temperament, and- the gentle-souled, tender-hearted, sober Henry Raymond, was con- verted into a " roaring lion, seeking whom he might devour," by intoxication. During a dreadful paroxysm, Nina fled from their poverty-pinched home to the dark woods, in the deep night, with her two little frightened ones, to escape his frantic violence; and they were drenched with a chilly October rain, that laid the foundation of an insidious disease, that ere long sent them all three to the friendly grave, sweetly sleeping side by side, from the sorrows and degradation of a drunkard's home. This great bereavement prostrated the frail form of Mary, and she was borne from the drunkard's hovel to the home of a maternal relative in the city, apparently only to die; but a strong constitu- tion triumphed, and even the blessing of insanity was denied her. But the sweet spring of youth was forever dried in her desolate heart, and no cool gush of pleasant waters has since moistened its parched and thirsty urn. And the great world rolls heedlessly on, nor pauses in its round of gayety and dissipation, to think how desolate and yearning must be the heart robbed in its earliest bloom of girlhood of all the green things that gladden the May-time of life; and only God knows and pities the great agony   that swells and surges in that lonely breast, for the cold world has no sympathy for the poor and suffer- ing. And many a one, blessed with home and friends, murmurs and repines because of some thwarts ed purpose, and bemoans their unhappy lot, as pecu- liarly unfortunate, and themselves as God-forsaken, when the troubles they realize and repine at would be but "trifles light as air," to the crushed and writhing victims of the monster-murderer INTEM- PERANCE. Ah! if those who grieve over adverse fortune, could look down into the arid waste of lives that know real sorrow, how much more gratitude would go up to God for blessings unappreciated, and trampled under the feet of a murmuring and un- thankful world. Mary's proud spirit shrank from dependence upon relatives for subsistence, whose affection would have shielded her from individual exertioi, and her mu- sical accomplishments were brought into requisi- tion to subserve her independence. Mr. Percy, who once petted and praised her, with a greedy eye to her father's coffers, now passed her with a stiff jerk of the head,-meant for an aristo- cratic bow, and coarse grunt of " how-d'e-do" sig- nification, like any other swine. Mary's lip curled with supreme contempt at every sight of the old hoary-headed Shylock, with one foot in the grave, and both avaricious hands clinging tol the golden rails of the world with a desperate, miserly clutch; and memory of the noble lover, buried in the morn.  330    THE DRUNKARIDS DAUGH'TER. ing of his manhood, in a living tomb, by the old miscreant's superlative meanness, filled her heart with doulble-refined hatred for the despicable wretch, and gave her mind a tone of misanthropy that shut her in -from all social intercourse. The death of his wife and children, under the circumstances, stung the soul of Mr. Raymond to remorseful madness, and in a fit of drunken despera- tion, he inflicted a wound upon his person, that confined him long to the poor-house, and had well- nigh proved mortal, and by many who once knew him, he is thought to have died from the insane stab; but a long-suffering God raised him up for some inscrutable purpose, and to-day you have witnessed the result of his restoration to physical strength and access to the intoxicating cup."

The reader is already acquainted with the resul t of his gentle philosopliic reasoning--that is, the acquiescence of Eva to the proposed test. Herbert Henley was what is called, in common par- lance, a" handsome man.' He had the deep, dark and peculiarly expressive eyes, so wofully destruc- tive to the equanimity of young maiden hearts, sparkling :with animation or melting into sympa- -th y,- Bright, jetty curls heightened the purity of his -manily brow, high and full, betokening intellect, btl-the-:horgan of" ideality, that "spring that is  :touched by -all the beautiful in existence, and whose sean:s of enjoyment' are as unbounded as li e uni- 'verse is extensive, wanting to give that brow-abroaad and noble proportion.

But Wil- mer's philosophic mind required somewhat more than mere externals upon which to base the fabric of his sister's earthly hopes, and penetrating the superficial veil of seeming virtue that immorality borrows to conceal its own defects, he-discovered that to erect upon the principles of Herbert Henley ould be to build upon a '"sandy foundation" Yet Her/bert was not considered a vicious man. Oh the contrary, for one untempered by -religious feeling, his moral standing was of no common order; still, "A similarity of mind, Or something not to be defined " was wanting to satisfy Wilmer that the higher faculties, whence spring esteem and love, would-not grow restless and dissatisfied in the atmosphere of mental un'congeniality when confined within the limits of connubiality, and by arousing-those high- faculties, those"Cliords that vibrate deepest pleas- ure,' and " thrill the deepest notes of woe," he de- sired to teach her the capacity of Herbert-Henley    ,or          -   34^2:      AEVA .

"Are you, ill, my sister?" he Lasred- affectionately, bending his earnest. dark eyes, anxiously upon :her own dewy blue-ones. "No, brother, but Herbert has been here.

Would to God his powers for retaining love were equal to his personal attractions. But away with despondency, -Eva. -Come, and I will teach you the way to hap- :piness, and the art of enjoying it." The streets of N---.:ere almost deserted as the brother and:- sister wended along in the cold moonbeams :that fell In silver bars upon the pave- ment, between the exfoliated boughs of shivering trees that edged the walk. No sound disturbed the stillness, save afew low echoes of homeward- bound foetsteps. "Where are you taking me, brother?" inquired Eva, as they turned down a dim alley from the lighted way. "To a home of destitution and misery, Eva. To the hearth of the drunkard's wife." "( Brother I and is this the way to happiness?" -"The way to happiness, sister, is by contrasting our;-condition with that of others less fortunate, and the art-of/enjoying it is byadministering to the wants of necessity, and improving upon the ex- perience-of'error."

Wilmer cast one glance around, and introducing Eva to Mrs. Winters, disappeared through the door. "Your brother has been very kind, Miss Evylin," said Mrs. W. "But for him and Dr. Ervill I know not what would now be my situation, for comfortless as it no doubt seems to you, compared with the days ere chance gave me their friendship, it is cheerful and happy*.' Eva, who had never before witnessed such desti- tution, found it impossible to restrain her tears, at sight of which the tiny girl crept from the: expiring embers, and- laying her baby cheek upon her moth- er's bosom, put up her round, red lip, and sobbed. in sympathy. There is a voice in tears that tells the whole story of the heart in eloquent and touch- ing language, and- Mrs. W. knew that, in ,Eva Evy- lin, she had found a true and sympathizing friend. "But how long have you known my brother, Mrs. Winters?" inquired Eva, at length. "Two years ago he came to- my desolate home more cheerless than this, and relieved the adistress of a miserable wife, justly expiating the sin of dis- obedience, blinded- by a youthful passion. Since then I  -have been a wanderer from here,:till a-few days ago Ii returned, with my fatherlesa, babes, to 1  ;5*             - A.   3164-      EVA MfV YjIN. this myearly home. Throughl Dr. Ervill,- whom .I met; tii morning, your brother was doubtless ap- prised of my arrival." Wilmer- now  re-entered-the room, followed by Walter Ervill, who started with surprise and colored deeply on seeing Eva. Soon after their entratice'a: woodman supplied the empty fire-place, and a bright blaze sent its genial warmth through- out the apartment. Mrs. Winter's eyes filled with tears of gratitude as she bent them upon the noble' young men, but Walter hid his head behind the- iunni  curls of the little prattling girl, to keep them from Eva;, while the black-eyed -boy was doing his utmost to Full open the fingers of Wil- mer, in order to come; at something which he was assured lay concealed upon the palm. Eva,-wholly unconscious of having inspired Walter With- a sentiment warmer than friendship, felt :addened by his reserve. True, they had met in social --converse but rarely since the school-girl had-merged ---into womanhood; but Eva thought the intimacy and familiarity of youth, with some modifications, might have extended to mature years.     -   -  "My Friend, Dr. Ervill,--informed me to-day of your return, Mrs. Winters.- said Wilmer., but I he :yeLt to learn if your husband is living." "I He is nbt," repliedf'she; " he died two months ago, tinderciricumstances the most distressing.

Ah, Mr. Evylin, the world is darkly traduced when they tell us it is all false- hood, selfishness and sorrow." . -- "Those -who assert that, Mrs. Winters,"' said Walter, '4expose the weakness and ignorance-of their own hearts, for the world is arranged in har- mony with all our faculties, the moral sentiments and. intellect holding the- supremacv, and- those who fail to attain what the Creator intended-that is, the gratification of these powers-stamp upon their brow, by the signet of sorrow, non-conformity to His laws. You, madame, wear its impress, but your heart and lip confess that you have infringed those laws, and incurred the penalty of that trans- gression. Had you exercised the powers that God designed to be the guide and control of a being destined to immortality, obedience to their dictates, though adverse to the promptings of nature, would have been attended with a rich reward. Judgment and reason are the only sure -counselIors, and if dis- obeyed, will be avenged-upon the offender.' Wilmer watched narowly the effect of this speech upon Eva, and saw, with pleasure, that her interest was deeply engaged.  ' You reason like my brother, Wal-, Dr. Er- vill," she answered. (She had. almost said Walter, but remembering his reserve, she blushingly made the correction.) "But I cannot -comprehend, she continued, "how Mrs. Winters could foresee that poverty and distress would accrue from her union.' ! ^-   348       EVA EVYIN. "She could not, by possibility, have foreseen such a catastrophe, Miss Evylin, but as 'obedience to eachIlaft is attended with its own reward, and dis- obedience with its own punishment,' she could have foreseen that sorrow and repentance would be the inevitable consequence of setting at defiance parent- al authority." "Parental authority,. reiterated Eva, glancing l inquiringly at Mrs, Wintrs. , Alas, -it is too true, Miss Evylin, that I set at naught a father's superior judgment, and, yielding to a wild and enthusiastic passion, eloped with my husband... -"And do you attribute her present pecuniary condition to that fact, Dr. Ervill?" inquired Eva. "  Pecuniary embarrassments proceed from physic- al causes, Miss Evylin. Her present circumstances, though arrising from that disobedience, are not the direct penalty :of that transgression. Had she wedded- her husband with her father's sanction, and the approbation of the higher faculties, poverty might have overtaken -her, but the sympathetic fibres of: two kindred souls would have gladdened its dim way, for poverty is not sorrow if not the result of propensities that eventuate in shame and self-reproach."  : "But had fortune continued to smile upon them?" said: Eva.   -  :-! Her punishment was certain," answered Walter r     eor g heryoug hopes perished with the knowledge that her husband was a  " drunkard, he would ','" .   EVA EVYIN.       :349 have added, but consideration for Mrs. Winters' feelings induced him to hesitate. "But had he proven all that her young heart fancied him?" said Eva smilingly., "Where is your philosophy now?"      - "Had, he been that, Miss Evylin, there would have been no parental opposition." "And is it invariably thhus?" said Eva. "May not a parent err as well as a child?" "Supposing her father actuated by other motives than consideration ' for her' happiness," replied Walter, "his injustice would not have justified her disobedience. And supposing her submissive to his unjustifiable requirements, the consciousness of having sacrificed love-to duty would have conduced to the satisfaction of the higher faculties, and yield- ed a greater degree of happiness than by offending tlhose powers, gratify the inferior feelings."- "The inferior feelings,' repeated Eva, "has affection its origin from thence?---the love of the heart, Dr. Ervill--does your philosophy teach to subvert that?" "The love of the heart, Miss Evylin,  said Walter, in a :voice slightly tremulous, "is the sympathetic influence of two equal powers, acting in perfect harmony, and must, in themselves, become dissatisfied to destroy the affinity of mind'-with mind.  As an illustration, I 'would say, had Mrs. Winters been obedient to her father's demands,:that obedience would have yielded its own reward with- out lessening her affection for the lover so long as   850    -    EVA EVYIN. -her superior faculties received direct gratification from his. To subvert the love of thel heart, the basis upon which it builds must be destroyed, and the fabric will fall and lay its fancied bliss in ruins. The only security is to test the foundation ere it construct, for all is not tlove, Miss Evylin, that bears its semblance."  /Eva glanced towards her brother and saw his eyes fixed approvingly upon the young speaker. "' As the; art of enjoying happiness is by improv- ing upon the experience of error," she said, faintly smiling, -" will tendeavor to profit by Mrs. Winters, und with two such ,reasoners to school my untrain- ed sensibilities, I fancy I may yet learn wisdom and discrimination.' .,. Walter's pale brow :crimsoned with happiness, and turning towards the fair girl, he involuntarily uttered: .i           - ':"Evai if you err, it will be, through the reflection of your, own purity."  -zDi sconcerted by his unusual impetuosity, he hastily rose, and would have precipitately retreated, but- Wiltner, ever on the alert, and with an eye singlge to .the :accomplishment of one object, arose -also,: and bidding Mrs. Wilmer good night, the 4 three visitors retired in company. Walter, by invitation, accompanied them to "Loveland's," as Wilmer's residence was styled, fromn its spacious enclosure and rural scenery, thus riveting, as the brother desired, -the chains still closer around his impassioned heart.   CHAPTER IV. ITME wore away, and the New Year was fast ap- preaching. Wilmer adroitly managed to bring the silent and the avowed- lover, and the- maiden, frequently together, that Eva might perceive the contrast. He also drew forth Walter's' eloquent and poetic powers, that some times startled the no less the poetic Eva, by its brilliant and- chaste beauty. She would sit, at night-fall, and hear him descant upon the glories of the Spirit-world, till fancy flew above the stars and gazed upon its splendor, so vividly was it portrayed; but let the proud and stately Herbert Henley enter the- hall and ' all was earth again," so powerful is a first passion!          ' Herbert really loved Eva with all his capacity, the very fact of which would have rendered her more wretched, by an alliance. The most: vicious men seek an amiable and virtuous 'wife, thus dis- closing their appreciation of that with which they themselves are unimbued; forgetting, in the im- potence of their nobler faculties,- that the very principles of which they are enamored, would- con- duce to indifference in the possessor, when repulsed by their own unsympathizing propensities, which [851]   352o       EVA EVYIN. indifference would excite jealousy, in the least ' worthy, that seed of death, " sown in weakness, and raised in power!" Eva passed many pleasant hours in the society of Mrs. Winters. Walter encouraged- the intimacy, knowing that Mrs. Winters was well qualified to excite, rather than suspend the activity of the finest Sensibilities.   ' : The unfortunate widow at length confided to her youngE friend the sad story of her past life, only reserving some truths that can npver find way from the heart's secret depths; for the heart mayv grow cold and estranged from- the -object that once thrilled it with fond affection, but the lips must for - ever be sealed to the unworthiness of one we have loved. Flora Wilton was the only child 'of wealthy and indulgent parents. At the early age of fourteen, death deprived her of a mother's love and care, and the whole wealth of a father's heart, centred upon hionly tie to earth. In-, bestowing upon her every accomplishment, necessary to fashionable life, the cultivation of the mind was forgotten, and the dark billows of, that neglect, rolled back, in after time, upon the heart of the deserted father. Two years from  her mother's death, Flora gave her heart to' Harry Winters, a handsome stranger, touring through the States, to whom her father objected, on the plea that knowledge of cha-  racter was indispensable, to obtain his sanction to his daughter's union.  *v, J         ,   ,           .   EVA EVYIN.       353 Flora, unaccustomed to opposition, eloped with her passionate lover, and they were married I Mr. Wilton died, soon after the consummation, forgiving his erring child, and bequeathing her his whole possessions. Had Harry Winters realized her every anticipation, the memory of- that fond, indulgent father's cold, white face and shrouded form, would have left in the heart of that disobedient daughter, and too late repentant wife, a life-long agony. Winters proved to be a penniless wanderer and professional gambler. Flora loathed the principles of her husband, but the mother's heart preferred sharing the father's degradation, to deserting that husband and father with all his contemptible vices, for there is a tie in maternity, it is said, that nought can sever. Mr. W.'s strides to ruin were rapid and reckless. With the hope of retrieving what he had already lost, in a state of blissful intoxication, he staked his remaining all, and a single cast of the die beggared his helpless wife and innocent babes. The friends of his prosperous hours fled like sum nr birds before the winter's gloom, and the keenest poverty, and wretchedness was the award of. his crimes. It was in this state that Walter was. called to attend the miserable wife, while the brute- of a husband, the author of all-her destitution, lay upon the bare floor in a trance of beastly- intoxication. Knowing the charitable nature of Wilmer, and his abundant means, he communicated with him, and in t conjunction relieved the distress of the impoverished wife and perishing babes. With the return of perishtng babes   354       TEVA EVYTN. health, Mrs. Winters left town, unknown to her benefactors, who never- revealed this act of charity. "had the son of him who won my husband's wealth, been as noble a soul as your brother and Dr. Ervill,? Eva,?' said Mrs. W., in cncluionlusion, I might-yet enjoy days of peace and plenty." "' And will he not assist you, Mrs. W.?" asked the thoughtful girl'. Has he not a heart of suffi- cient flexibility to compassionate, and relieve the wants of an injured wife, wronged by his own father?  l'Hie tells me that he is not answerable for the deeds of that father," said Mrs. W. "I have little hope for mercy at his hands, though the amendment of those wrongs would little impair his immense wealth..l Herbert H-enley, though a brilliant star in the gay world, is sadly deficient at heart h Eva turned deathly pale at that name, and com- plaining of indisposition, returned home in a state of m'ental agony. Wilmer rose, smilingly, as she etered; and throwing herself wildly upon his bosom,: the poor girl wept long and passionately. Tenderly he inquired- the cause of her distress but promising toreveal all in the future, she retired to her chamber to weep over her disappointment.- ' Wilnmer's distress was no ways inferior to his- sisfer's, and learninglfrom her maid that she had visited -Mrs. Winters, he was s0on standing beneath her roof, and gathered- from the grateful widow'the source-of Eva's unhappiness, in" the recapitulation ,of the conversation.    CHAPTER   V. HE .new year came.  Clear and cloudless it 1 dawned, and the bright cold sunbeams glittered upon a thin snowy shroud, unrolled in fleecy white- ness over the bosom of earth. The hour for- con- fession had come, and Wilmer seated himself beside the pale Eva, and drew her young head upon his manly bosom. Thus they sat months agone; and what had the intervening period brought of joy or woe? All the hopes of a brother's heart hung upon the developments of that narrow space of time. Silently they sat, till -a low sob from Eva told that the past was fraught with sorrow and disappoint- ment. "My sister," he said, trembling, ":have you dis- covered aught in the character of Herbert Henley, to awaken regret'?" "I have Wilmer," replied Eva, lifting her tearful eyes to his; "and now, brother, recur nomore to the past. I :will never wed him as he is, but I can never love-another"    - "'I am no 'prophet, nor the son of a: prophet,' Eva," said Wilmer, making an effort to :cheer her sadness, " but, if I. should predict I would yet give (355) r.   356-       EVA EVYIN. -our little heart a victim to Cupid, and make it believe it had never loved by once." "Never, Wilmer, never. I can love no more." 'The heart that once truly loves never forgets;  But as truly loves on to the close: As the sunflower turns qn her god when he sets, The same look that she gave when he rose.'" "Hearts united by mutual sympathy will never forget, Eva, though distance forever divide them: but the heart, rudely repulsed -by uncongeniality, like the vine around the lightning-seared oak will fade and fall away, yet leave the germ unscathed. But tell me, sister, with the knowledge that you possess of Herbert Henley, do you love him yet?"  Eva hid, her face and was silent. Her higher  feelings -clashed with the inferior, and nature warred with judgment. Her trusting heart had invested Henley with every perfection;. and now that the weil tas lifted, and reason looked upon his deformed principles, still the tendrils of passion clung tena- ciously -around her first fancy. In proportion as the heart is easily ensnared, without the interven- tion of judgment, is it loth to relax its hold when intellect comes in to dispel the-illusion;i for the preponderance of propensities that urged it blindly onward, though restrained by the perceptive powers, hold in check the superior feelings, and leave i; to alternate between desire and will. A supremacy of superior :feelings, had Eva possessed it, would :hae held in abeyance the inferior, and permitted a . i      EVA EVYN.        357 her to resign Herbert Henley with less violence to "her faculties, now that the higher were offended. As the shades of twilight deepened, Henley was announced at Loveland, and ushered into the pre- sence of Eva. She rose to receive him, pale but calm, to an observer, yet mentally there was a struggle for mastery. A soft flush suffused her fair face as she met the smiling eye of the object of her first sweet dreams, but it quickly faded away be- neath the snow of her young cheek. Wilmer rose and left the hall, and Herbert availed himself of the opportunity offered, to again urge Eva to decide his fate. In a voice low and trembling, despite her efforts to subdue emotion, she gently but firmly declined the honor of his hand. Henley started, colored deeply, then became deathly pale. All the weak-- ness of the young girl's nature defied restraint as lie clasped her hand passionately, and bending over gazed wonderingly, yet mournfully, in her blue eyes, and yielding insensibly to his embrace, she sobbed hysterically upon his bosom. "Eva, I fancied I had awakened an answering echo in your heart, or I should not have subjected myself to the humiliation of this hour. Have I been deceived, dear Eva, in believing that you loved me?t "; I have loved you, Herbert," replied the maiden, rallying, and withdrawing from the arms of -her lover . "And how have I forfeited that love, Eva?"   EVA EVYIN.  With a mighty effort she summoned resolution to confess, that though her heart urged acceptance; she rejected his hand from conviction that happi- ness-c6uld not be long realized in an alliance where dissimilarity of disposition was so apparent. Hen- ley was confounded. He had hot dreamed that the Volatile and impulsive Eva could be controlled by rigid calculating judgment. " Andwill you lay the heart a sacrifice upon the altar of false philosophy ?"  : "It is not false philosophy Herbert. If similar- ity of, mind is necessary to the support of love, it were better, far, to 'part now in amity, than by uniting ':moulder piecemeal upon the rock' of dis- sension and discord." "You have never loved as I have, Eva," he said, bitterly," or you could not thus crush my dearest hopes."- "'-he! future must test that, Herbert. You know my motive for refusing my hand against the plead- ings .of my heart, Time will tell the depth and purity of your own affection." Hrberbert Henley left the hall, that ,night, with a heart, oscillating between love and pride. "To be rejected by her," he soliloquized, " when others far more lovely, and equally as gifted, would proudly wear the name of Henley." H'lEerbert was not deficient in intellect, and secret- lyiconfessed the wisdom of Eva's decision; and but for his indomitable pride, which he strove not to control, he might yet' have won her hand, but his   I   -j   EVA EVYLIN.               359 self-esteem took alarm, and in four months he was united to the beautiful heiress of Colonel Elton, of N Eva, as the intimate friend of Ella Elton, was chosen bridesmaid. She deliberated long, with regard to accepting the invitation, but virtuous pride came in to the aid of weakness, and she re- solved to go. "He shall see that I am capable of supporting what I have advanced ,nshe .said mentally.  " He shall not triumph if appearance; can-deceive; and yet, am-I equal to the effort ?" she asked herself. " Well has Byron sung  'Pride may cool what passion heated, Time will tame the wayward will; But the heart in friendship cheated, Throbs with woe's most madd'ning thrill.' He never loved me, or he could not so soon have forgotten. And should I not feel grateful for such an escape?  But, after all," she ejaculated, ' has he not cause for righteous indignation, to be discarded from so poor a plea?  What knows the heart of reason?   Can philosophy school it to apathy ? I know he is deficient in the noblest prin- ciples of human nature, but, I love im yet I and I can never love another. But I have sealed my own fate, and pride must bear me out. Oh, brother, your philosophy has destroyed my every hope." With such reflections she arrayed herself for the trying scene. "You look so pale, Missis," said her maid. "Jist   360,-      EVA EVYIN. let me put on a bit of paint, or you'll look like a ghost, to-nightt." Eva, though unaccustomed to sporting false hues, wishing -to conceal her own weakness, yielded to her maid's entreaties, and a soft tinge added lustre to her flashing eyes. Accompanied by Wilmer and Dr. Ervill, who -fancied she had never appeared more gay and lovely, she sprang into the carriage, and was soon set down at the brilliant mansion of Col. Elton. Firmly,.yet with a palpitating heart, she ascended to the bride's apartment to await the appearance of the groom, Soon the door was thrown back, and the lovely Herbert Henley en- tered, and sat down, smiling, beside the blushing Ella. Glancing around upon the train, his dark eye fell full upon the bright blue ones of Eva. A rich flush mantled his brow as he recognized her w-ith a slight bow -of ease and grace, Eva returned it- with calm and cool politeness. Walter felt her slight form quiver, as she leaned upon his arm in the crowded hall, and the words were spoken, "I, Herbert, take you, Ella, to be my wedded wife, to love," but no emotion was visible in :her smiling, -glowing face. Thus may the heart hide behind the veil of seeming. 'Eva was: -an accomplished pianist and sweet vocalist, and during the evening was frequently called upon for a song, which request she as often declined, tilloHenley united his importunities. "He is unfeeling," she said mentally, ' and exults in my incapacity. I will- teach him otherwise;"   EVA EYVYIN.         361 and taking the arm of Walter, she stepped lightly across the hall and sat down to the piano. A faint- ness came over her as her hands swept the keys and preluded the air, but the knowledge that his ear was attentive, gave her strength, and in a voice sweet and clear, yet slightly tremulous, she sang -the touching lines of Charles Jeffreys :- "Oh I take her, but be faithful still, And may the bridal vow Be sacred held in after years, And warmly breathed as now. Remember, It is no common tie That binds her youthful heart; 'T is one that only truth should weave And only death can part. T 'lhe purest hopes her bosom knew When her young heart was free, All these, and more, she now resigns, To brave the world with thee. Then -take her, and may fleeting time Mark only j6y's increase; . And may your days-glide sweetly on In happiness and peace." Her voice, which had become faint, as she pro- ceeded, suddenly rose, lute-like and thrilling, and in a firm, distinct tone, she repeated the last stanza, and turned her smiling eyes upon the wedded pair. Ella answered her with a loving glance, but Her- bert gazed earnestly into their azure depths, while a shade of thought flitted across his handsome face. Eva observed the change, and pitied the' trusting bride. 16   362        EVA EVYIN. "How unworthy," she thought, "to peril her happiness in seeking to be revenged upon me," and with a deeper insight into the character of him who had inspired her young heart with a first passion, she returned home, more aiive to the uncertainty of Ella's future happiness than her own disappoint- ment.  But I can never love again," was the sym- phony to all her train of meditations. Eva" felt confident of that. She had been deeply, darkly dis- appointed, and she resolved in her heart, never to trust more. CHAPTER   VI. ALMLY, yet very pale, she wandered through the silent halls of hqr lonely home, and amid the opening blossoms of the young spring. Wilmer's watchful eye saw her slowly fading, day by day, and every means thatlove could devise was resorted to in order to beguile her silent sorrow. Walter was her daily companion,--Wilmer alleging that the declining health of his sister required his careful at- tention. Eva learned to watch for his foot-fall; and the young physician experienced an exquisite thrill of joyful hope as he met her welcome smile. Walter had broken through all restraint from the , hour they met at Mrs. Winters'. Wilmerinformed him of her promise with regard to Herbert Henley, and with a trembling soul he awaited the develop- ment. Herdecision aroused all the hopefulnes of - ' '^.w^   EVA EVYIN.       363 his nature. "If I can but win . her heart," he mused, "a few years, with my prospects, will give me a name and fortune. What could I not achieve if stimulated by her love?" Two months from Henley's nuptials Eva was confined to her chamber. Disease bad not impair- ed her physical constitution, but an aching void within the heart had worn upon and prostrated her nervous system,and she lay in infant helplessness. Walters skill was brought in requisition to strengthen and invigorate the mental functions; and watchfully and tenderly he lingered beside the pale young sufferer. It was a lovely, balmy evening in' June. The breath of summer parted the light drapery and swept into thesick chamber, dalling with the brown curls that lay in dishevelled beauty around the calm, white face of the slumbering Eva. 'Wal- ter Ervill entered noiselessly and bent over the beloved sleeper. "Lovely, ardent girl," he murmured, "the world were nought compared with the love of that heart," --and in the ardor of his own, he softly pressed his ips to her unconscious brow. A hand was laid gently upon his arm; he started, turned and crim- soned on beholding Wilmer. "You love her, Walter?" said the brother. "Forgive my temerity, Wilmer," replied the young physician. "I do love her. I have loved her from childhood, but never till this hour berayed that affection." -  .  "  * :. ^    364     -  EVA EVYIN. "My sister's happiness is dearer to me than aught else, Walter. Win her heart, and, to you I will en- trust the keeping of that happiness with joy and confidence." Ervill grasped the hand of the noble brother, and turned- hastily away to suppress- his deep emotion. From that hour their hearts mingled in mutual sympathy and interest. In two weeks Eva was permitted to descend to the parlor, though pale and feeble. With the flight of time health returned, and with it cheerful- ness-though unlike the sprightly gayety of the maiden of bygone hours. There was now a sedate, thoughtful dignity in her deportment that repelled lightness, and her demeanor towards her brother indicated the purest love and deference; for Eva had learnedIto respect his judgment. Often she met Henley, who strove to engage her attention; but calmly and coldly, yet with smiling politeness, she eluded his efforts. Wilmer observed her acute- ly, and his eyes sparkled with pride and pleasure at the display of her indifference.   4;:   CHAPTER    VII. rWELVE months had gone, and summer came again.  Eva's cheek had grown bright, and her smile sunny as of yore, but her heart wandered away to all the beautiful of earth, and Walter almost despaired of ever imprisoning it in his own bosom. The destitute ever found a friend in {the gentle and benevolent girl, who truly sympathized with every sorrowing heart, and in administering to the happiness of others, Eva secured her own; and Wilmer's philosophy had accomplished this. "How ill Mrs. Henley looks," said Walter, as Ella departed after having passed an hour at Love- lands. "Her health is very precarious, she tells me," ans;wered Eva, glancing involuntarily towards- her brother. "She and Mr. Henley leave for Saratoga to-morrow." ' !"I trust it may not be in ,vain," said Wilmer. "The blooming Ella Elton can scarcely be recog- nized in the pale and dejected Mrs. Henley."; Eva remained silent, and sedulously avoi. her brother's eye. They had never spoken of tf past since the hour of confession, and she felt averse- to :*   -(365) \   '    ' / - *:   366        EVA EYYIN. prolonging a theme that revived therecollections of that. - Walter here proposed a ride ; and equipping her- self in an equestrian habit, they swept down the busy thoroughfare and emerged   into the fresh breezes of the cool, free woodlands. "How beautiful," cried Eva, with enthusiasm, as she gazed upon the flowery wild: " well has Cole- ridge said: ' Methinks it should have been impossible, Not to love all things in a world so filled; Where the breeze warbles, and the mfte still air Is music slumbering on her instrument.'  Walter turned his expressive eyes upon the fair girl, .and answered, in the language of Wordsworth, "Nature never did betray The heart that loved her. " Eva, met his earnest gaze, and slightly coloring, replied, with affected lightness : * "No, Walter; and why should we turn from all At:he beautiful and true to give its treasured worth to a mortal, changeful thing. Oh! give to me the full,:freel soul that spreads its spirit wings and circles all, spurning the fetters that would enslave it to an object subject to the sad reverses that Byron so touchingly bewails: 'Oh, would it were my lot To be forgetful, as I am forgot.'" "Biut the heart must have sympathy, Eva,"  said Walter. "The Creator has implanted a principle   EVA EVYIN.       367 within it whose natural tendency is to meet and commingle with a kindred spirit; and though we love and trust, and are deceived, yet will we trust again, and how blessed a thing it is that our souls are so constituted." "You know I never question'the truth of any assertion of yours," said his companion, smiling; "but I have yet to be convinced ofthat ; for I have loved and been deceived, Walter," she added, con-i fidingly, " and I fancy I can never trust again." But for the shade that deepening twilight threw along their way, the colorless cheek of Ervill would have betrayed his heart to the artless and unsus- pecting girl. He soon mastered his feelings ; and from a desire to spare her the pain of knowing the sorrow she had occasioned, answered, "We tan truly sympathize, dear Eva, for I, too, have experienced a- heart-disappointment, and can never love another."  i"Say not so," said she, affected by his sad tone, "' though deceived yet will we trust again.' " "I have not been deceived," he replied. "She ;: was worthy, but gave to another the heart from - which the tendrils of mine can never be dissevered." Eva lifted her eyes to the tiara of stars that glittered upon the brow of young night, and Walter saw that they were liquid with tears of sympa- thy. "I never look upon the spangled heavens," said she, mournfully, "without recalling the lines of poor Byron :-   368        EVA I;VYIN. "Tis night when meditation bids us feel  We once have, loved, tho' love is at an end; The heart, lone mourner of its baffled zeal Tho' friendless now, will dream it had a friend.'" Walter exerted his powers to revive her droop- ing spirits, and, never unsuccessful, she alighted at Lovelands smiling and cheerful. CHAPTER VIII. ANOTHER year rolled away, and Eva was still the free-hearted; happy maiden. Lovers bowed at her shrine, but left untouched her heart, and the gay world whispered, "she is invulnerable"-but some asserted that Walter was the chosen. Eva laughed at Madame Rumor, and informed her she felt no disposition to quit the pleasant shores of celibacy and launch out upon the uncertain sea of matrimony. True, Walter was her constant attend- ant-for with him she was ever happy. He could soothe her chafed spirit in hours of sadness, and lull her restless thoughts upon the Aide of his deep eloquence,- but it was the love of a Slster's heart the maiden gave to the silent lover. Walter was -happy in the society of the loved one, yet despaired of making her his own. But Wilmer was more san- ' guine. It was a pleasant eve in the autumn time, peculiar only to te stheh ou th, when the last roses of summer give their wasting perfume to the low winds as   EVA EVYIN.        369- they rustle through the fading garniture of nature, making soft music with its flutterings. Ervill had not visited Lovelands during the day, and Eva re- clined within an open lattice, gazing out upon the night-shades, murmuring:  "Why don't he come? Ive watched afar, By the feeble light of yon glimmering star, Till my weary eyes grow faint and dim, And yet thro: the mist I trace not him." "Why does not Walter come?" she -said, aloud, to Wilmer, who sat with an open volume before him, seemingly absorbed, yet, in- reality, watching with pleasure her attitude and anxiety. He strove to suppress the glad smile that longed to leap out upon his lip, and answered, soberly and carelessly, "His professional duties have, perhaps, detained him." A step was heard in the hall, and Eva's eyes grew bright-as the night-lamp revealed the tall, fine form of the young physician. His face was very pale, but the sunshine of a loving heart irradiated it as he received the maiden's welcome. "Truant," she said playfully, as he gently pressed her extended hands--"l why have you remained so long away? I was growing dull and spiritless, for some wretched fairy has run off with brother's phil- osophic heart, and my 'pent-up' thoughts were .be- coming restless, for Dr. Young says, 'thoughts pent  up want air.'7  Wilmer and Walter exchanged smiles, and the latter repeated: 16'.   370       EVA EVYIN, "I have been necessarily detained, Eva, or I should ere this have luxuriated in your smiles; and yet the pleasure I now enjoy renders me more sen- sible of the truth of your author's assertion that- ' blessings brighten as they take their flight.'"  Eva looked earnestly and inquiringly at the thoughtful speaker, and he continued--"I have but come to say farewell, dear Eva,; to-morrow I go to the far West, perhaps to be absent long." "Eva's cheek grew white as the rose-bud half buried amid her curls!, and she turned silently away. Wilmer smiled significantly upon the lover, whose face glowed with the rapturous emotions that quivered in his heart; and whispering the brother, who retreated noiselessly from the room with a heart exulting in his sister's distress, he approached the casement and stood beside the maiden. His eyes followed hers, and fixing them upon the stars he Sbftly -repeated:  "'Tis night when meditation bids us feel, tWe once have loved, though love is at an end." She turned involuntarily and met his joyous smile. "Dear Eva," he said, "can you- yet make a self- appropriation. of that sentiment?" She blushed and-trembled, but:remained silent. "I once told you," he continued--" that I had experienced a heart-disappointment, and that I could never love another; my heart has known no change, for I love, nay, idolize her yet; but Eva, dear E:va,"-and his arm stole around her slight form-" myfirst, my only love is here."   EVA EV Y I1.      ,"' She started convulsively;, a rich glow overspread her white face, and laying her cheek confidingly upon his bosom, the trembling maiden wept Wal- ter's arms closed fondly around her, and bending his lip to the half-exposed brow, he softly asked- '"You love nme, Eva?"She raised her blue eyes to his, and answered fervently-"I do love you, Wal- ter!" He pressed her closely to his heart, and the pent- up love of years found vent in the simple words, - ' My own!" 'Twas night again, and the mansion at Lovelands was brilliantly illuminated. Fair forms thronged j the halls, and a buzz of expectation wavered throughout the assembly. "Behold, the bridegroom cometh," cried a light- hearted maiden, as a white train entered and the company rose. They were a lovely pair. Walter, with his tall, fine form and beaming blue eyes, through which the gentleness of the soul looked forth :-a bright flush was on his cheek, that swept upward and gradually melted away in the purity of his broad manly brow, that softened in the shade of dark chestnut curls- and Eva, with her delicate form robed in simple white. A trusting smile was on her lip, and her azure eyes looked lovingly up in Walter's bending ones as she answered distinctly-"I will."  Two years have gone since then. Eva accorm :: panied Walter to the far West, and returned to witness the nuptials of the noble Wilmer, who was   3w2:      EVA EVYINT. happily wedded, and adopted the bright boy of Mrs. Winte'e, who bids fair to be as great a philos- opher: as his benefactor. Mrs. Winters has learned to smile again; and the prattling girl causes the happy home of Ev-a to ring with silvery music. Herbert Henley is yet the proud, sordid lover of gayety and fashion, and Ella the pale, thoughtful wife. Walter often steals noiselessly in to watch the rosy Si ibers of a tiny cherub, with all a father's love and pride, and Eva still blesses the hour that gave her to the arms of her noble and idolizing husband.  f    THE GEM; OR, THE CHARM THAT WINS.

Had you seen her last night, as I did, kneeling beside a bed of straw, ministering to the wants of a dying child, when she thought that no eye save His who never sleeps witnessed the outpourings of her noble and generous nature, you could not but confess that pure and holy feelings may dwell in a heart that lies enshrined within a bosom of so cold an ex- terior.

Cruel Miss El- wood, to attribute that obnoxious characteristic to one of my unassuming and unsophisticated nature! But say, Mr. Melville, are you equally unfortunate?" "I presume,"replied Melville, " the excess of my gratification is equal to your weight of mortificatioan for I have a portion of that last gift of the interesting flower-girl. Though deeply sensible of my utter unworthiness of the appropriation of the sentiment --yet I esteem myself most favored by receiving it from such a source." "Yes, the smooth-tongue Hthat's always ;the way with men!-flattery is a natural propensity, an inherent quality, appertaining to that sex." "Not so, Kate-a pious man s encomium is not flattery, and Edith knew from the calm tone, and  mild, unaffected air of Melville, that no false display was meditated. Any woman, Kate, of sound sense, like Edith, can never suffer imposition from such a course, and though she may despise a coxcomb's panegyric, yet nothing is more pleasing to the ear than a wise man's praise; and mark me, Kate--a wise girl can never be flattered. Though Edithll's cheek blushed at the declaration of Melville, there was no flash of indignation emitted from her eye, for she was of too frank and unaffected a nature to assume aught not truly genuine.

Either ex- treme, Kate, is reprehensible, particularly the last, which is the more general." "Well, there's another lesson I will think of, cousin-but where did you leave off ?" "Why, cousin," laughed Lucy, "I thought you were not sufficiently discerning to form correct views at first sight !" " And have I not evidenced it by the distribution ? Mr. Seyton denies' the imputation of changeable- ness, and Mr. Loland of vanity-but come, cousin, we9aait the development of your judgment." "'Well, there's a sprig of clematis for you, which betokens ' mental excellence ;' a magnolia for Mr. Seyton; a hydrangea for Mr. Loland, and a piece of laurel for Mr. Melville."

" Oh, yes,' said the gay Lucy, " be patient-one moment-there," said she, as she wrapped a small slip of paper around the last blossom, "now for an exercise of your powers of discernment."

"I can point you to one instance, at least-Mr. Melville declared himself unworthy to receive your gift." "I said however much they might be deficient in noble qualities." "Oh, I comprehend," said the laughing Lucy, " you would insinuate that the most worthy make the least pretensions." " Precisely, and that I may be counted worthy to rank among that number, I will accept Mr. Seyton's gift with as good a grace as possible' "'Behold how great a matter a little fire kind- leth,"' said Lucy, with mock gravity.

"' And Miss Elwood this, and Mr. Melville-" "Are you ill, cousin?" said Lucy, as Edith rose from her seat with a face ashy white, and walked towards Nancy, who was gathering strawherries not far distant, but soon returned with a firm, proud step, and a glow upon her cheek, which added brilliancy to her dark eye and a threefold lustre to her charms. "But pray, explain the cause of this sudden trans- ition, cousin Sarah--I do not comprehend?" "Well, Kate, his gift signified 'disappointed hopes.'" "Oh, I understand you now--he must have been a 'i/heartless' creature to have presented that to her." "Yes, indeed, but such is frequently the result of insensibility and indiscretion, and being sadly defi- cient with respect to both of these qualities, and his little soul being piqued at her distribution,.he awoke a fount that for a moment swept away the ; veil that hid, her heart-from the eye of the world. But invoking pride to her aid, she succeeded in h ehiding its mighty gushings beneath its deceptive /:; /tasfk.

(' Yes, cousin ; but did not Mr. Melville display his intuitive powers?"      .  ' In a manner, Kate, most interesting. To the two gentlemen he gave a geranium oak, which signified 'true friendship,' and called forth great acknowledgments 'from Mr. Loland, whose beauty was wholly lost on Nancy's 'jejune powers of rati- ocination.' Lucy received a China aster, whose language corresponded with what he had previously declared in reference to her laurel gift, since it was 'your sentiments meet with a return.' But to Edith-" :"Aye to Edith, cousin-what did he give to Edith?-a moss rose or mignonnette?" "Neither, Kate, although they would have been appropriate, but a simple sprig of coriander." "Coriander i-what 1 'that ugly plant?" "And are plain objects less meritorious than lovely ones, Kate?" "Not always-but in this instance he should have selected a beautiful flower with a beautiful emblem --a moss rose would have been suitable, for, beside - being the queen of flowers, the emblem would have f suited her character."'  , Very true, Kate; but the idea he intended to ' convey would have been expressed, for, instead   396       THE GEM-; OR, Of' superior merit, as- your moss rose signifies, his gift spoke of ' concealed merit.' " "Indeed! well that was better-but who would have thought that so common and insignificant a flower contained such a sentiment? I suppose it was derived from its intrinsic worth, and not ex- ternaI show." "Yes, Kate; and thus it is with many human beings--you pass them by unnoticed, because of their plain appearance, until your hybiscuses and hollyhocks and primroses have disappeared in the winter of adversity, which only serves to reveal their concealed merit." "Well, don't preach now, cousin, but tell me the result of this singular selection of Mr. Melville." "Well, as you may suppose, it elicited ejacula- tions of surprise from the party, whose secret, astonishment exceeded their involuntary tmanifes- tation, when they saw the' cold,' 'stupid' Edith's hand tremble and a tear fill her eye as she received itifio-n him." And  what was the cause of that, cousin?" ' "Tre are some persons, Kate, whose sensi- bilities are too deep to be comprehended and ap- preciated by light natures, and such was Edith -^ - Elwood.

"Well, but how did she bear up under this new, weight of sorrow? I suppose she abhorred the simple face of her lover's wife?"

Tolton had first won her confidence by his sanctimonious deport- ment, and how could she regard him otherwise than, contemptuously when divested of that garb which alone had taught her to love? .No,: no--!Edith's mind was too pure to loe a worthless being. ]Had he been worthy, she couldhave descended cheerfully to the lowest shades of pofverty-s-e could have defied the scorn and malice of t heartless world,  had it pointed at him the finger of derision, and like as the tender vine around the mountain ash, supports its slender boughs, even in clinging for protection, so would she have comforted him in sorrow's night, and deemed no sacrifice of wealth, friends or station too great, if rtaderfor him. But that heart, capable of such deep emotions, and which he once called his own, was now cold as -the bosom of the dead towards him who kindled its earliest flame. Believe not, Kate, that true love never dies-the warmest emotions that can possibly animate the human bosom will dwindle into nothing- ness unless nurtured by the' charm that wins.'" "Here is one instance, at least. But did this Tolton render his wife happy?" "Happy I yes, if, being reduced from affluence to the capacity of a seamstress, in order to secure daily bread for herself, himi rnand three helpless babes, can be considered happiness! Don't look so incredulous, Kate, for this is no fiction.

Edith was herself a wife, and a happy one, too." "Ah, indeed, cousin!--well, I positively thought that was a desperate case.  But who was the winnier?"

The : gay and the noble came around, to win her from her sadness, but none could boast -of having made the slighlltest impression upon her invulnerable heart.   THE OHARM -TAT WINS.     a408 She turned a deaf ear to all cries but those of the poor and needy, and many were the young voices and tearful eyes that hailed her approach with gladness. She often met Melville at the bedside of the sick and the dying, and as his deep, manly voice went up to the ' Giver of all good,' in behalf of the afflicted, she regarded him as a brother, in her love for the good' and noble, almost doubting that the fall of man from his high estate, extended to so true an image of his Maker. Consequently, entertaining such views of his superior merit, she avoided him not as others of his sex, and their united efforts soothed many an aching heart, and- lighted with joy many a dimmed and hollow eye.; thus :strengthening, by daily intercourse, which only served to adduce incontestfible proof of his genuine piety, the sisterly regard that had sprung up spontaneously in her bosom for him; but Edith never dreamed of Wilmot in any other light than that of a br6ther." It was a sweet evening in June, that Melville and Edith were wending their way slowly towards the deep old woods wheroe;two years before he had presented her the coriander. There was an un- usually sad expression upon Edith's pale cheek, the cause of which may be gathered from their c6n-- versation.       -           : "Ah, my sister, for such you have ever been to, me, and as such I must address you, how many changes- have taken place since first I sat within these shades 1--and many may transpire before I - c   **- v ,"'-..,        , '        - '2 - "* ^N'   TE ,fEjfEM; OR,   -    - "  am again privileged to. visit them!
