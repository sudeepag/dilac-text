The unfortunate young lady whose history we are about to write
was' the only daughter of one of the "Merchant Princes," of New
York. Her father, Jacob Fosbenner, was a man of German extraction,
very rich and liberal in some respects, but in the way of business, ex-
tremely "close," exacting the last cent from his debtors, and paying
all his own liabilities with the punctuality of clock-work. His only
daughter Adeline, and his only son Frederick, were educated in the
best manner, according to the American standard of education, and
their natural talents were far above mediocrity. Adeline, especially
was an object of general admiration, on account of her mental gifts,
her many accomplishments, her amiable disposition, and her large
fortune. .The last named advantage probably gave additional lustre to
all the others.
In order to make this narrative easily understood, it is necessary to
explain that Mr. Fosbenner's exact business habits were carried into his
domestic concerns. He allowed a certain sum for every family expense;
so much for provisions, so much for fuel, so much for clothing, etc.
Each of these allowances was quite sufficient for the specified purpose;
more, indeed, than was absolutely required to keep up the elegant style
of living in which the family indulged-but on no account would the
old merchant permit the expenses which he so handsomely provided for
to be exceeded by a single dollar. Such was his humor, and it is a
strange circumstance, that this peculiarity of the old gentleman caused
all the trouble we are about to relate.
The sum which Mr. Fosbenner allowed Adeline for the purposes of
dressing, was no less than fifteen hundred dollars per annum, and she
easily contrived to spend that amount in dry-goods stores, milliners,

mantuamakers and jewellers; indeed her taste, in this particular was
somewhat extravagant. Her pyirchasea were so large and frequent, and
her. bonnets,, shawls, mantillas, etc., were changed so often, to conform
with the variations of fashion, that the sum supplied for her wardrobe
expenses was often exhausted, leaving her without many articles of
dress or ornament which she earnestly desired to have, and it was very
seldom that she was quite satisfied with her equipments.
At times, therefore, she was discontented and unhappy, complaining,
like FloraMcFIlimsey, that she had "nothing to wear," and believing
that tie restrictions which hyr father had placed on her inclinations for
dress were niggardly and tyrannical, although the sum which he had
appropriated for that use was more than would be required for the
maintenance of a respectable family.
Yet Adeline possessed an excellent heart and a good understanding;
she was benevolent and charitable in the highest.degree--her faults were
the effects of improper training. She had been taught from her infancy
that to follow the fashions was a necessity of her being. 11cr mother
had pursued the same course, and on her death-bed had exhorted the
weeping girl to persevere in the effort to become a leader of the beau
monie, which had always been the high st object of her own ambition.
Such was the last advice of the dying parent, and Adeline promised
to obey the counsel; we need scarcely add that she religiously fulfilled
that promise, while she had the opportunity to do so, but circumstance
soon placed it out of her power to obey the injunction of her departed
parent.
Adeline was in her sixteenth year when she lost this exemplary
mother. It was inithe autumn of 1860, about two years after that
melancholy event, that the4 fashionable circles of New York were
thrown into a state of fermentation, on account of a splendid fancy ball
which was soon to take place, and at which all the monied magnificence'
of the city was expected to be present.
At this very juncture, Adeline, to her great dismay, found that her.
wardrobe fund had been sadly diminished, and that the residue would
hardly enable her to make that dazzling appearance at the gay festival
which her position in the social circle seemed to retire.  This d
-was terribly afflicting to her; she was compelled to make her purcovesy
for the occasion with some regard to economy&amp;.ubt very soon her ls
dollar was expended, arnd by a strange oversight, she had neglected to
provide herself with a suitable pair of gloves. The remembrance of
this want occurred to her while~she was yet in the store where she had
sought several articles and laid down the last piece of her money.

What was she to do ?  The gloves must be had--but how were they
to be obtained ? Many persons would have solved this difficulty by
resolving to borrow some cash or to purchase the goods on credit.
Adeline was shut out from both of .these expedients. - Her father had
taught her that borrowing was a beggarly practice, and almost as dis-
graceful as stealing, aid the credit system was equally an object of his
detestation. Adeline, from her knowledge of his character and senti-
ments, had every reason to believe that her father would be very much
incensed if she should use either method to supply herself with the article
wanted.
While these thoughts were revolving in her mind, a lady entered the
store and requested to be shown some white kid gloves of the finest
quality. A package of such gloves was placed on the counter by one
of the salesmen, and opened for the lady's inspection; having purchased
a pair, she departed, and the shopnman being called away to a distant
part of the store, the gloves were left open on the counter.
Before we describe what followed, which may seem incredible to
many who have an imperfect acquaintance with human nature in its
various phases, let us consider all the circumstances of this extraordinary
case, and the constitutional peculiarities of'Adeline Fosbenner. In her
ordinary mood, she was perfectly honest, and few persons would be-
more unlikely to commit an unlawful act, even under, the strongest
temptation. But Adeline was one of those-strange mortals who often
do things totally inconsistent with their general character, so that their
most intimate friends are frequently at a loss to account for some part.
of their conduct. Indeed, there are persons of this sort, who are often
unable to account for their own actions, and who believe that they are
controlled by some influence, which is totally independent of their own
will. Such "impressible" persons sometimes, without any apparent
motive, commit deeds, at the recollection of which, they are shocked
and horrified during the remainder of their lives. This is not the-
effect of spiritual or demoniac possession, as some people imagine, may
result from disordered mental action, or a species of partial or temporary
insanity, causing impulses, which cannot be resisted.  Tnder some
such influence, a young man who was watching the motions of a forge-
hammer, was impelled to place his hand under the ponderous instr-
ment, and the consequence was that he was maimed foie. hvn
thus endeavored to account for the fact we are about to relate, we will
proceed with the narrative.
The package of gloves, as we sai, was left open on the counter, and
the salesmen were engaged in sttiendink to~ customers in differe-en part&amp;

had better' not try. If you don't hear what I have to say, you'll
have to listen to a police officer, and that may be still worse for you.
'Turn down Varick Street, and I'll follow you."
She gladly turned out of the public thoroughfare into the more
retired street pointed out by her persecutor. Within a few minutes, he
was again at her side. The 'whole deformity and repulsiveness of bis
figure and countenance, were now displayed to her observation. lie
was a short, square-built man, with very round shQuld ers, long arms
and bandy legs; his face was' seamed with -scars anderstudded with
pimples ; his dress was coarse and badly fitted,.and he addressed Addino
with a rude familiarity, which shocked her still more than his general
appearance, although that was inexpressible disgusting.
"That wts done pretty well,"'said he, as soon as le overtook her,
"but I can larn you how to do it still better. You'll make afirst-rate
prig with a little training."
"I,--I don't understand you, said Adeline trembling and averting
her eyes, "you must be mistaken in the person."
" Not a bit of it," said the ruffian, "I reckon Isaw you hook them
gloves. You thought I was looking another way, eh, my girl ?  That's
the beauty of having a good squint. When you think I'm looking due
north, I can see all that's going on at south-west. I'm a lucky feller,
Iam, to have that nateral gift."            y/r,
"You are mistaken," said Adeline, but with faltering accents, "I am
not what you take me for."
" Why Miss, I take you for a thief, and I can prove that you are
one, for the very gloves you prigged are now in that 'ere pocket. No
use of denying it you see, but I don't wish to spile your trade, for I'm
in the same line myself, and I want you to come to my 'cdemor
larn to operate in a better style. You can make lots of moneyify a
choose, and all I ax, is for you to give me a sheer of the proceeds."
"I do not wish to make money in that way," said Adeline sorrow-
?ully, "I have money enough, and will give you fifty dollars if you will
'leave me instantly and promise never-tojspeak to me again."
" Where's the cash Miss; I'll promise to obleege you, though I think
it's a pity that we can't keep up our acquaintance and work toget
But for them fifty dollars Miss, I'll agree to your conditions.'g" r.

"Podh! I can't be fooled in that way;" said the man, "there is any
quantity of them shining articles selling in Chatham Street for twenty-
five cents apiece. I must have better security than that.'
"I will meet you here again to-morrow and bring the moniy, or
something of equal value, as you yourself may judge. But leavenm
now; I would not for the world be seen by any person-who knows me
. " In my company you mean, Miss," said the fellow with a satanic
smile, "but I guess you've been in worse company than mine, or soon
will be, if you force me to have you arrested. As for leaving you,
don't think of it ; I'in going to stick by you, until some satisfactory
'rangement is made atween us."
"Oh heaven! what shall I do ?" said Adeline, wringing her hands.
I tell you," said she, again addressing her tormentor, "my father is
one of the richest men inthe city, and if you will do as I' bid you, I will
be soon able to give you more money than ever you bad in your life."
"Ahern! what's your papa's name, Miss :r"said'the fellow in a
mocking tone. " It's very strange, Miss, that sich a great young lady
should have to steal a pair of gloves. That rich papa of your'n must
be a mighty stingy old curmudgeon, I .hould think. But what's his
name, that's the pint I want to fend out."
"I must not tell you; I had rather die than tell my name," said
Adeline.
" Oh, ho! then I'll keep with you, till you go home, and I can spell
it out on the door-plate."
Adeline stood, irresolute on the pavement. The curiosity of the
passers by, appeared to be excited by the appearance of such an ele-
gantly dressed and seemingly respectable young lady, in earnest con-
versation with a man, who was evidently a plebeian of' the lowest order.
Some persons seemed to.walk slowly, or to make a half pause, as if to
catch a word of their discourse. In the meantime the anguish of the
wretched girl was reaching its climax ". bf
"I will drown myself in the dock," said she at last, before I will
go home followed by you. You will gain nothing by driving me to
desperation.- But come after me to that jewller's shop, on the other
sieof the street, and hear me ask him what this. racelet is worth
IHis reply will convince you that I have not deceived you."
The fellow acceded to this proposal, and the report of the jeweller,
when he had examined the bracelet, was so favorable, that the 'rascal
snatched at it eagerly as soon as Adeline and he had emerged fom th
shop.

SmE REALIZES$ HER TERRIBLE POSITION.

"You stole it of course," said he, "and you must understand the
game better than I thought. Well, I'll'dispose of'this affair, and give
you half the money, but as I find that you're.so well up to the trade,
I must insist on being your pardner. -You must do reglar day's work,
and be industrious. I'll sell whatever you can fetch me, and make an
honest division of the spiles."
"But you promised that you would leave me on receipt of fifty dollars
* or an equivalent."'
"I've changed my mind," said the fellow with dogged resolution, "I
must know where you live before I lose sight of you."
Adeline now remembered a poor Irish woman, residing in Church.
Street, for whose family she had done several acts of kindness, and
being unable.to think of any better expedient, she determined to go to
'this woman's dwelling, and so make her troublesome companion believe
that it was her own place of residence. On her way thither, he still
walked by her side, offering her great inducements, as he thought, to
engage in the occupation of a thief. Among other confidential in-
formation, which he vouchsafed to her, he gave her to understand that
his name was. Hickson, and that his business was "fencing," meaning
to signify that he was a receiver of stolen goods.
It is impossible to describe or even to imagine,  iss Fosbenner's
agonies of mind, when she found herself associated with this infamous
person. Glance at that proud beauty, who but a few hours before was
an object of universal envy or admiration, in the higher circles of
fashion. See her now cowering before one of the most degraded of'
human beings, submitting to his insolence and pleading'4for his com-
passion.
IHere was a change indeed; and it came on her like some mighty
convulsion of nature, an earthquake, an overwhelming torrent, or a
tornado, producing a 'kind of stupefaction or lethargy, which almost
deprived her of the power of thought /or action. She found it hard. to
realize the truth, that all this trouble proceeded from so trivial a 'matter
as a- pair of gloves; but then she remembered that she had comma fitted
a criminal deed, a felony, an act which might consign her to a male-
factor's cell in the state's prison. And here by her side was the ac-
cusing spirit, who controlled her destiny, who could instantlysumn
the ministers of justice to take her in charge.        stmo
It was in the power of this bad man, to have hor dragged like any
other criminal, through the' crowded 'streets of the city, to make her a
spectacle for the jeering populace, to blast her reputation for ever, and

ADELINE ESCAPES FROM HER PERSECUTOR."2T
to have the story of her guilt scattered abroad, through the public
journals, to the remotest part of the country.
She felt that she was a slave, and that a being whom she utterly
despised and loathed was her master.
Her faculties. we say were overpowered by all these terrible con-
siderations. Had she had more experience in the ways of the world,
or had she retained the power of reflection, some means of extricating
herself from her calamitous situadon, might have presented itself to her
mind. She might have made        situation known to her father, orb
some other experienced friend. That, indeed, would have been the
wisest course, but to her perceptions, death seemed more tolerable than
a confession of her fault to any human being.  She might .have sought
the advice of a lawyer, who could easily have effected an accomodation
of the. matter, but had she even thought of this expedient, she could
not have made use of it, without stating the disgraceful fact to her
legal adviser, and for her to do that would have been impossible.
The Irishwoman to whose dwelling she now directed her steps, war
named McFadden. Her'husband had been killed in battle about the
beginning of the war, and left her a widow with two small children.
A-few weeks prior to the events, with which our 'narrative commences,
one of Mrs. McFadden's children, while begging in the street, had,
excited the compassion of Miss Fosbenner, who learned from   the
child where his mother lived, and- she had several times since visited
the poor widow's house and relieved her distresses, without making the
object of her bounty acquainted with her name or condition in life.
Still accompanied by Hickson, Adeline now entered Mrs. McFad
den's house, and taking the widow aside, she begged her in a few
hurried and almost incoherent words, to assist her in making Hickonk
'4     believe that she resided in that place. To this Mrs. McFadden made
no objection,.as she was under great obligations to MissFosbenner;,
and iickson being now satisfied that he knew where Adeline might be
found, gave her an expressive warning not to make any attempt to
elude him and then withdrew.
For some time after his departure, the miserable girl sat still in Mrs.
McFadden's humble abode, her alarm and sufferings having deprived

28                 HER RELATIVES ALARMED.
o ject now was to destroy the fatal gloves, which had been the cause
o  all her affli tion.- When they were reduced to ashes, her harassed
nd experien ed some temporary relief. But the events of a few
hou    ad   de alterations in her personal appearance which could not
escape the notice of her relatives.
Miss Dorcas Fosbenner, a sister of Adeline's father who resided with
him, was the first to observe the change which had taken place in
Adehines -countenance and demeanor, and being very much alarmed
thereat, she called Mr. Fosbenrier's attention to the subject.
Indeed, the appearance of the young lady was calculated to awaken
the apprehensions of her affectionate aunt. The roseate tinge of beauty
had fled from  her cheeks, a ghastly paleness overspread her whole
countenance; and her eye, which lately sparkled with animation and
happiness, now alternated between the wildest expression of terror and
the fixed gaze of despair.
As soon as Mr. Fosbenner's attention was directed to these wonderful
changes, he inquired with much anxiety, if anything extraordinary had
occurred to alarm or distress her, or whether she had been seized with
suden illness.  The manner in which she, evaded those affectionate
inquiries, served only to increase' the uneasiness of her father and aunt,
but they found it impossible to obtain any satisfactory explanation.
For several days, Adeline kept her solitary chamber, brooding Rover
her misfortunes and refusing'to see any company.
The great fancy ball had passed away, but she had ceased to feel or
express any interest in the affair. She could not be persuaded to
appear at that grand exhibition, and her relations were now convinced
that her intellect was disordered. This suspicion was probably correct
in a measure, as it is impossible to account for all her subsequent cor
duct, without supposing that her reasoning faculties had been impaired.
She sat for uncounted hours in listless idleness, her eyes fixed on the
ground and her whole appearance indicating the d e pest dejection.
This state of things continued for two weeks, at the end of which
time she began to recover some of her former cheerfulness, and at length'
hewas persuaded to walk abroad occasionally, but it was observed that
she always did so with evident reluctance.
One day she had agreed to accompany several of her young friends
in 'a promenade to Union 'Square. One .of the party was Charles
Mayherry, a young naval officer, who appeared to 1)e deeply in love
with Iiss' Fosbenner, and it was believed by many that she was not
indife ent to his merits. While the young peor le were walking through
mh enclosure, Adelmne, who seemed for the time to have resumed much

off her former vivacitsuddnly uttered an exclamation of terror and
laced her hands before heeyes, as if to shut out some frightf:d
apparition.
IIer companions looked in the direction from which the object of her
alarm seemed to approach.
A man of very unprepossessing appearance was advancing towards
Adeline, hisserpent eye being fastened on her with an expression of
tinumph. When he came near, he yelled out in most discordant toncsi
"Aha ! Miss, I have found.-you again
She made no answer, except adeep groan.
Mayberry, being very much incensed at the behaviour of the intruder,
advanced, seized him by the throat, and after shaking him violently
threw him on the ground.
The man arose with some difficulty, having been considerably
punished by the vigorous handling he had received, and without takiog
yny notice o- his assailant, he again addressed himself to Adeline,-
"You cheated me the other evening, young woman, but I will make
sure of you now.",
Mr. Mayberry, observing the increasing distress and alarm of. Ad
line, said=
"Do you know this person, Miss Fosbenner, or will. you permit me
to give him the chastisement he deserves, and drive him from your
presence.
"Oh no! no!    For heaven's sake, no,"answered Adeline, in great
treidation, "the man has a message for me, and I must hear him.
The surprise of her companions was boundless, but they withdrew to
some distance and left her alone with Ilickson.'
"N~ow, my gal," said he~ "your hot-heated beau has given me a
pretty bad hurt, but I'll not take that into the account. .But you must
gve me some kind of security for your appearance, whenever Iwant t~
see you.
" What kind of security can I give you ?' asked Adeline, piteously.
"If you want money, you shall have it as soon as I receive my next
quarterly allowance, I can do nothing more."

ADELINE. TAKES A TERRIBLE OATH.              8
mice little article among sicn crdnies,'.and I-can dispose of 'em to niore
ad] wan tage than any -body 'else.in this' city  .But .you must swear asrI
tell you- and heaven'-help jou if you don't keep your oath.'.'
"What must I swear?"
"That you will meet me at the woman, McFadden's, over Friday
at three o'clock, to 'give an account'-of your week's work."
"I can not make such an engagement," answered 4deline.
"Then you shall never leave this ground,.till you' are arrested'!" said.
Hickson, in a loud and angry tone; "and I will begin by telling your
proud friends, yonder, to give you -the ,dead-cut, because you are a
thief, which they. don't seem to know at present."
"I will engage to give you a hundred :dollars on the first day of every
month," said Adeline, "if you will have pity on me,:and not drive me
to some'act of desperation."
"A hundreds dollars a month ? tut! that's a flee-bite.' A smart ga
like you can 'arn. ten times.as much by pigging small fancy articles
from the trimming shops; but if you go into. the.je welry line, your
pickings will be worth thousands a nionth instead of hundreds."
"I have no wish to follow such . trade, and I never will consent *
do it."F)
" If that's your resolution,:I'velone with you, madam, and I'll ban'
you over to that policeman that's jest coming in at the gate. Shall.I
call him,?"'
"Wait one moment. I will write to my brother, who is nom,    _
Princeton College, and entreat him to lend me some money. You shai'
be well paid for your forbearance."
"No. Promises won't do.   Your brother at iPrinteton Oollge !-
more likely he's at Sing Sing. Swear this instant, o rby--.....' I'll settle
the business at once, and you'll be locked 'up befureshalf an hour."
lIe then dictated a terrible oath, the terms' of which almost froze
Adeline's blood, but. she saw that there was no alternative, exceptare'
posure and utter ruin, or a compliance with the villain's dem~and.
The oath was taken ; she bound herself not only to meet Llickson ~a
the titne and place specified, but to -remain in the city and to make no
effort to escape from his control. All this he required :of her, and 'all
her tears and entreaties could 'not 'prevail -on him to mitigate these

requirements.
Ilickson, having thus .accomplished his objet, charged her to be
punctual in her engagement, and4 after 'uttering various threats- to
enforce his authority, bade her a surly good morning, and left the
square.

Miss Doreas, thinking there might be some truth in Mary's supposi-
tion, which indeed was partly confirmed by her own observation,
immediately went to communicate the whole matter to Mr. Fosbenner,.
giving it as her opinion that it was "a very, serious case, as her niece's
health, and life, perhaps,.would depend on her father's decision, whether
she should or should nt be united to the man of her choice."

4           FEARUL MYTERY--ADELINE'S    CONDUCT.
This man's tyrannical behaviour to Adeline seemed to proceed from
some' other motive besides avarice, although that was, certainly one of
his ruling passions. He..seemed to take a diabolical pleasure in
tormenting his victim  and triumphing over one, whom he must have-
felt to be, in some respects, superior to himself.
Adeline's companions now returned to her, but all' conversation was
at an end. The whole party seemed to be occupied with thoughts and
conjectures.respecting the scene they had just witnessed, and which, ofr
course, it was impossible for them to understand.
The distress of Adeline could not be concealed, and Mr. Mayberry's
dejection of spirits was scarcely less than hers. The attachment he
had formed for her could not blind him to the fact that there was some-
fearful mystery in her conduct. She evidently stood in awe of the,
ruffian who had accosted her in the square; circumstances had proved
that she dared not offend him. How did she become acquainted with-
that suspicious person ? And how did he obtain such an apparent
ascendency over her?
These were the questions which agita  Mr. Mayberry's mind, as
the conducted Adeline to her home. On arri ng at the door, he took
leave of her with a sad countenance, and  deline, hastening to her
apartment, threw herself on her bed and abandoned herself to the most
-agonizing and terrible reflections.'
Meanwhile, a female domestic who was very much attached to Ade-
line, and who was deeply concerned on account of the deep melancholy.
into which the young lady had fallen,'informed Miss Dorcas, Adeline's
aunt, that she knew the cause of Miss Fosbenner's unhappiness; " but,"
said she, "I would never have told what I know, if I did not think-
Miss Addy's health would suffer if the whole truth should not be made
known to her father."
Miss Dorcas, suspecting that some extraordinary revelation was about
to be made, requested Mary to tell what she knew.
"Well, the whole matter is," said Mary, "that Miss Addy is in love
with Mr. Mayberry, and because he is not very rich, she thinks her'
father will never consent to -their marriage. -I am quite certain that
this makes all her trouble."

This direct appeal to the parental affection of Mr. Fosbenner, had
the desired effect. He expressed the highest esteem for Mr. Mayberrys
'character and declared that his want of a large fortune, should be up
obstacle to his union with Adeline, if both of the young people were
inclined to the match, Miss Dorcas thought there could be no doubt
on that point, and this assurance being given, Mr. Fosbenner promised
to open the negotiation, as Miss Dorcas suggested that the reason why
Mr. Mayberry had never proposed, was his dread of a rejection by
Adeline's friends on account of his inadequate fortune.
The next day, ,Ir. Mayberry called to enquire after Adeline's health
and Mr. Fosbenner took that opportunity to broach the subject, which
was uppermost in his thoughts. lie signified to the young gentleman,
that he had taken notice of his attentions to Adeline, which had been
continued for nearly two years, and he thought it was time to come to
n understanding on the subject.
To deal frankly with you," said the old gentleman,'" I have
accidently discovered that my daughter is favorably disposed towards
you, andi'yur feelings towards her are such as we may infer from
your   quentvisits, there is nothing to "prevent the settlement of the
.affair to your mutual satisfaction."
Mr. Mayberry grasped the old merchant's hand, and pressed it with
grateful cordiality as he replied:
"Mr. Fosbenner, the proof you have just given me" of your good
opinion and friendship, is most gratifying to my feelings, and two days
ago the intimations you have made, would have overwhelmed me with
joyful emotions, but- '
" Well sir,"said Mr. Fosbenner, somewhat stiffly, "perhaps we have
misunderstood each other ; if so, let us drop the subject at once and
forever."
"D'o not be offended with me, my dear sir," said Mr. Mayberry,
still pressing his hand, "there is a circumstance which I ought to have
communicated to you before. My friendship for you and the fervent
love I feel for your daughter,, should have prompted me to do so, but I
was unwilling to take a step, which I knew would be a cause of um .
easiness to you, but I will hesitate no longer, as the kindness you have
ghown me, and the debt of gratitude which I owe you, would make it
almost criminal on my part to keep the affair concealed any longer.'
He then gave Mr. Fosbenner an account of the scene in Uniorn
~Square, and although the incidents were softened and made more favor-.
able to Adeline in Mr. Mayberry's statement, Mr. Fosbenner was
absolutely dismayed by the recital.

"My dear boy," said he to Mr. Mayberry, "advise me if you can.
I need not request you to refrain from repeating this frightful story to
others, but tell me- candidly what you suspect. Good heavens! I
would as soon have suspected&amp;an angel in heaven of any improper act
or of any disgraceful associations. What can it mean-?"
"I can form no conjecture," said Mr. Mayberry very sadly, "perhaps
such an explanation ma    given by Miss Adeliie herself, as will re-
move every unpleasant suspicio from our minds."
"No," replied Mr. Fosbenner, "she will explain nothing.  We
questioned her closely concerning her melancholy, and the strange al-
terations which have tiken phice in her habits and appearance, but she
will give us no information whatever. I will go to her once more and
insist -on a full explanation of this most unaccountable conduct."
"Let me beg you not to be harsh with her," said Mr. Mayberry,
"perhaps it would he better to wait until she recovers in some measure
from he- present state of dejection, and it may be that when she is
more composed in mind, she will voluntarily give you all the information-
you wish."
Having offered this suggestion, Mr. Maybery endeavored to comfort
the afflicted father by expressing a hope, which he scarcely felt, that,
-all might turn out well. Ie then took leave of his old friend, and the
latter hastened to make Miss Dorcas acquainted with the facts of
Adeline's case, which had just come to his knowledge.
In the meanwhile, Adeline herself was enduring agonies of mind,
compared with whicli all bodily torments would have been insignificant .
She could not violate the dreadful oath she had taken ; for it seemed
to her that the safety of her soul depended on the fulfillment of that
obligation. - She must meet Hickson at the appointed place, but as for
beginning the career of a professional thief, in obedience to his require-
anents, it was a thought, which she could not bear to entertain for
moment.
The night was passed in sleepless anguish ; the day dawned, but in
Adeline's soul all was still, dark and comfortless. No means of de=
lverance presented itself to her mind. - She would trust no one with
her secret, and of course she could have no adviser or sympathising
friend.
Jn this way several days passed over and Friday came. Friday!
the day appointed for her interview with Ilickson. Feeling that she
must endure that trial, she prepared herself for it with a desperate
6fort. She was punctual to the hour and found Hickson already at

THE HEARTuEss VILLAIN.
" What have you got for me ? Give me what you have collected."
" I have nothing," said Adeline faintly, but seeing that he was very
much disappointed and enraged, she added "except these," taking
several small articles of jewelry from her dress and presenting them
to the heartless villain.
"This is not much," said he, "you must do better or I shall have to
punish you. But you must go with me now to a place where you will
learn something useful. After all, I don't think you're very well up
to all the tricks of the trade. You must take lessons. Come with
me.
"For mercy's sake let me go home," said Adeline, "I cannot go
with you; I cannot be seen
"Ha-! ha ! ha !'' laughed Hickson, "ashamed to be seen with men
By      you act -,that well. .But I have no time for such fooling.
Come along."
He seized her by the arm and dragged her towards the door. She
begged him to desist and promised that she would follow him without
compulsion.
"Well, if you choose to follow me like a dog, rather than walk by
my side like a lady ; well, have your own way," said 'Hickson, "so as
you come somehow I'm satisfied."
Followed by Adeline, Hickson passed through several bye street
and alleys, till he came to a snra1Twooden building, situated in a nook
among those intricate passages. Hickson opened the door withod
knocking, and led the way into a shabby apartment on the first floor
where two young women were seated, each one reading a Sunday paper
and apparently very much absorbed in'its contents.
"Come gals, you are losing too much time," said Hlickson, "don't
you know that time is money, and every minute lost is so much cash
out of your pocket. Have you been out on your beats this morning.'
"We were out till one o'clock;" answered one of the girls, "and as
we met with  retty good luck, we thought we might. take an hour or
two to improve our minds."
"Why, I've no great objection to that," said Hickson, " I rather
like to see gals fond of reading. I take pretty well to perlite literature
myself, and some of them stories in the weekly papers are jest to my
liking. But let's see what you have picked up this morning."
Each girl produced a package, opened it and spread the contents out
en a table. The plunder consisted of fine handkerchiefs, stockings,
gloves, pieces of lace and ribbon, and other small wares, such as could
conveniently be stolen from the counters of dry good's stores, millinery

shops, &amp;c. Hickson examined 'the goods without any particular signs
Qf approbation.
"lHumph! no great matter," said he, "but I'm glad to find that
you've been doing something at all events. Gals should be industrious.
You've heard tell that idleness 'is the root of all evil. Now Bet and
Sal here's another crony for yob. I don't know her name, but you
can ax her what 'tis and so get acquainted. 'She wants training ; show
her how you work, and if you choose, when you go out again, you can
take her with you to learn the practical part of the business."
So saying he gathered up the stolen goods, and mnnde a portable
bundle of them, by tying them up in a handkerchief; then giving each
of the girls a small sum of money, he went away leaving Adeline with
her new associates. The young women scowled at her with evident
dislike. Her beauty, probably, and a certain air of superiority, which her
sorrow could not conceal, did not prepossess them in her favor. They
stared at her in silence for some minutes and then one of them abruptly said:
"Well girl, what is your name ? "
"Adeine with some hesitation answered, "Susan Baker."
"Susan be d-   d," said the other girl, "we shall call you Suke."
"And what's your lay Ske ?" said the first interrogator.
As Adeline made no answer to this question, which indeed she.did"
t understand, the questioner anglicized it by saying, -
"What's your line of business, Suke ?"
Adeline seemed to be still at fault, and Bet bawled out in an angry
tone.

steal ? Do you understand that  rNow, what is the fool crying about?
What a confounded baby that old rascal has brought us ! Does he
think that I'd go a prigging in such company. Why some of these'
tricks of hers would be sure to have us grabbed."
That's so," said Sal, "she shan't work with us; see her blessed
first. Let her try it awhile on her own 'sponsibility."
But I s'pose we'll have to show her some of the dodges," said. Bet,
relentingly, "we mustn't be too hard on her, if she hastn't got any
'complishments.  Every one must have a beginning. Now Suke, did
you ever steal a piece of ribbon."
" No, never," answered Adeline mournfully.
," Well, I'll put a lot of ribbon blocks on this here table. Now,,
emadgin that every one cf them blocks -has got twelve yards of
satin ribbon wotuid around. it. Let's see you slip one of them

To                'ESQ., ATTORNEY AT LAW.
Sir. The writer of this is a most unhappy gir, who has become int
evolved in great difficulties by one criminal action.. Some influence
for which I cannot now account, prompted me to steal: an -article of
trifling value from a dry-good's store. A man of very bad character',
ivho happened to be in the store at the time, was the only witness of th
tieft. Ile has, ever since, exercised a control over my actions, b
I ijreatening to have me arrested, and he uses this means of intimidati4
to compel me to steal continually, for his benefit. My family is in affluent
Oireumstances, but nothing can induce me to reveal my name. tf
you are disposed to advise and assist me,-in this difficulty, you shall be
well paid for your trouble. Let me know if you can suggest' Any meani

Adeline took up one of the blocks.
" Is .that the way you'd do it," said Sal with a sneer, "then
angme if you wouldn't git what you deserve for your cussed awkward-,
ness. I tell you what it is, Bet, I don't like to speak disrespectfully
of my feller creters, but my solemn 'pinion is that this gal will never:
make a decent prig.
"It's not in her," said Bet, "she hasn't got the lateral genus."
"But Hickson's got a different notion," said Sal, "he says he saw
her hook a pair of dollar kid gloves quite slick at Baldwin's store, and.
she .hooked that bracelet he showed us, so she can't be sich a clumsy
fool after all."
"I s'pect Suke," said Bet, "you kin do better with jewelry; stick
to that and it will pay you well."
"I should like to go home, if you have no objection," said Adeliiu
timidly.
"You maly go to the d-, for what I. care," answered Bet.
"And further too," said Sal, "if you don't feel comfortable when yciu
happen to get into decent company."
Availing herself of this leave of absence, Adeline hastily departed.
A  new cause of - terror now presented itself. She saw that her fate
would introduce her to the companionship of disreputable women, such
as those she had just left. This thought was more distressing and
terrific to her, than her dread of the State's Prison. She resolved to
do something to put an end to these intolerable troubles and persecu-
tions. - Death itself would have been a most welcome relief, but her
-religious feelings would not allow her to determinO on suicide.
It was. about this time, that I received from  her the following
letter

of ecape for me, and I will write to you again. Address S. B. at
Mrs. McFadden'g No---Church Street.
I answered this note, by informing the writer that I could not advise
her unless she could make me acquainted with all the circumstances of
the case, and the names of the parties.  This, it seems, she was un' il-
ling to do, for the correspondence was dropped, and the hurry of busi-
ness. prevented 4me from thinking any more of the matter. I now
deeply regret that I did not give her my assistance, which I certainly
would have done; had-I believed that her representations of the affair
were true. As Ilickson was the only witness against her, and as he.
was a man of infamous character, the charge of theft preferred by him
would have obtained no credit. Indeed by having him indicted forde-
ceiving stolen goods, which could easily have been done, he might have
been put out of the way, before he had an opportunity to bring a charge
against Miss Fosbenner. But, her excessive anxiety to keep her name
bidden, deprived her'of the benefit of legal advice, and left her in the
power of one of the blackest villains, that ever disgraced the human form.
At the time when the letter came to my hands, I observed the singu-
lar beauty of the chirography. It was the prettiest female hand I had
ever seen, and this circumstance enabled me to recogniz the same
writing afterwards.
During the week succeeding the events we have related, Adeline,
instead of employing herself in thieving, according to the order of
Dickson, selected some of her finest jewelry as an offering to this
severe task-master, intending to make him  believe that the articles
were obtained in the manner he had ordered. The trinkets were o
great value, but when Adeline presented them, the wretch whose avarice
was insatiable, still expressed his discontent.
"Why it would be very easy," he said, "foryou to collect a bushel of
these things in a week. You must bring more of them the next time
you come, or we sh-ll have a quarrel. Now I want you to go to- the
house where I took you last Friday, (you know the way,) and help the
other girls to do some work which I have set them at."
"I would rather not go there," said Adeline, ".I am quite ill to day
and unable to work."
" None of your idle excuses, i'eplied ilicison, "go you must and
that's the end of it."
This was said in such a brutal and decided tone, that she despaired
of producing any~iffect on his mind by expostulation or entr-caties, and
although a visit to the house occupied by Bet and Sal, was one of the

severest trials to which she could have been subjected, she'found that
it was unavoidable, and proceeded at once to the detested place.
While she was pleading with Hickson, in the manner we have
described, she observed that her Irish friend, Mrs. McFadden, seemed
to be very much excited. This woman had always disliked Hickson,
and at times when'he tyrannized over Adeline, her indignation. ap-
1  pearedto be roused to such a degree, that it threatened to break forth
into some violent demonstration.
Once when 'she was alone with lMiss Fosbenner, she informed the
young lady, that Iickson had endeavored to "pump " her as she ex-
pressed it, that is, by cross-questioning, to btain some account of Ad..
line's history and family connections.
"In coorse," said Mrs. (McFadden, when she related this to Adeline,
"I tould him.nothing, seeing that I knew nothing' myself, and if I had
known iver so much, sorrow a bit of information should the rascal have'
got from me. All that I know of-you is, that you helped me to get'
food and medicine for my sick children, and if you were as bad as
Hickson says you are, or if you were the divil himself, I should love
and honor you for your kindness to my poor little Johnny and Ellen,'
and if it warn't to plaze you, sure I wouldn't let the ugly baste come
into my house."
With some, difficulty Adeline found her way to the obscure dwelling
of Hickson's female confederates. They expressed no gratification at
seeing her again, but ordered her to join them in a task at which they
were busily engaged when she entered.
This task was the removal of all the store-marks, from  a large
quantity of fancy goods, which had unquestionably been stolen, and
the object now was to leave no signs about them, which('vould enable
the rightful owners to identify them, if any clue to their whereabouts
should be discovered.
Very reluctantly Adeline began to, assist in their nefarious labor,
Bet and Sal, all the time, making her the butt of their malicious ridi-
-cule; but her -spirits were too much prostrated to allow her to resent
this insulting behaviour, . What must then have been the bitter re-
flections of the fashionable belle, who had always boen accustomed to
the kindest 'and most respectful 'treatment from all who 'approached
'her. It is really wonderful that she' could retain possession of her
lenses under such a dreadful reverse of' fortune.
It was almost night when the work was finished, and then Bet in-
formed Adeli'ne, that she was at liberty to go, but immediately added :
"llickson says we must take you out with us to-morrow, and see,.

PERILOUS ADVENTURE.
if y9u can help us. I don't like the notion myself, but I s'pose I'll
have to run the risk of being nabbed to please him. But if any trouble
comes to me on your account, cuss me if I don't stab you. Now be off
and see that you are here to-morrow by nice o'clock."
With a swelling heart and streaming eyes, Adeline left the place and
began to search out her way among the intricate streets and alleys,
but the confusion of her mind and the increasing darkness, soon caused
her to go astray.
In about half an hour, she found herself in a part of the city, which
she had seldom or never seen before. Many drunken and disorderly
people were perambulating the pavements and the whole neighborhood
.seemed to be in a state of unhealthy excitement. Before the door of
a low grog-shop, several dissipated-looking young men were gathered.
By the light of a dim crimson-shaded lamp, which hung over the.door
of the groggery, she saw enough of these persons to make her wish to
avoid them. Being about to cross the street for that purpose, she dis-
covered that a still more repulsive gang, was^ stationed orb the other
side, so preferring the lesser evil, she proceeded on her course.
One of the rowdies immediat- tooktok a position in the middle of the
pavement, and stretched out his ums as if to intercept her on her way.
In great alarm she paused, and the fellow advanced to the spot where
she stood. He was dressed in something like fashionable array, but
the flashy style of his equipments, and an ostentatious display of glittering
chains and other bijouterie, which might have been either gold or copper
confirmed a suspicion which his manner and general appearance ex-
cited, namely that he was not a real gentleman.
" Here is my girl now," said 'this unattractive person. "How are
you Lizzy ?" Then grasping Adeline's arm, he added," come in and re-
fresh yourself ith a gin cock-tail."
"You are mistaken, sir," said the affrighted Adeline, "my name
is not Lizzy' andI never saw you before. Let me pass."
" Can't think of it, my dear. beauty like yours is a cash article in
this neighborhood, but as for letting it pass without some examination
it's not our custom, and blow me high if I don't have a kiss or two
before you proceed any further."
H-ere he attempted to throw his arms around her. Adeline uttered
a piercing scream, which was answered by a loud 'laugh and cries of
"'go it Joe," " take care of her claws," "hold her, tight," &amp;c., from
the various- group of spectators standing about the neighborhood.
At that moment, a carriage was' driven rapidly through the street.
'The sound of Adeline's scream seemed to: attract attention. Tha

vehicle paused, a gentleman leaped out and approached the spot, where
she was struggling with her assailant. A blow from a walking-stick in.
the gentlen.an's hand laid the ruffian on the pavement. At the same
moment a rush was made by some of the spectators, as if to take ven-
geance for the assault on their comrade.
The gentleman taking Adeline's arm, led her towards the coach, and
at the same time kept the rowdies at bay with his cane, several  them
receiving some severe blows, while they were endeavoring to clseI with
him. The afrighted girl was placed in the coach and her protector
follow ed. A shower of stones was sent after them, as the driver, putting
the whip to his horses, drove off with his beat speed. The windows of
the carriage were broken, but the persons inside fortunately escaped
injury.
The gentleman endeavored to soothe Adeline with assurances of her
safety, but these assurances only increased her dismay. The voice
was that of Mr. May berry, and the dread of being recognized by him
was no less appalling to Adeline, than the danger from which she had
just been delivered.
It was Adeline's custom, when she went to make her weekly report
to Ilickson, to dress in thme plainest manner, in order to avoid obser.
vation as much as possible. In the simple garbs which she wore on the
occasionto which we ,ow refer, Mr. Mayberry did not recognize her.
He saw a woman ill-treated and his chivalric spirit prompted him to come
to her rescue.
Nothing could have been further from his thoughts, than any sus.
picion that this woman, subjected to the insults of a low ruffian, in one
of the least reputable quarters of the city, was Adeline Fosbenner,
lately the object of his adoration. .Though there was something inex.-
plicable in her recent conduct, which excited a feeling of distrust in his
mind, he cou'd not imagine that she had fallen so low, as to become a
forlorn wanderer through these discredited streets in the hours of
darkness. .'
He was, for reasons which the reader may guess, almost the last per.-
son in the world, by whom Adeline would have wished to be recognized
in the eircufhstances we have described. While she was in the carriage
she did not venture to speak, lest the tones of her voice should beti ay
her, and when they had, proceeded the length of a few blockgs, she sig..
nified by a movement of her hand, that she wished to- get out. Mr.
~Mayberry ordered the driver to stop, assisted Adeline to descend' the
steps, and bade her good evening. She hurried away without making
any reply, and the carriage drove off in another direction.

On the following morning, at the hour appointed, Adeline who had
passed another sleepless night, repaired to the house where she had
passed the preceding afternoon, intending to plead illness as an excuse
for not accompanying Bet and Sal on the proposed thieving excursion,
for the risk of being seen in their company by some person who knew
her, was so:obvious that even the dreaded anger -and resentment of
Jlickson could not reconcile her to this expedition.
When she entered the room where Bet and Sal generally sat, she
found that they had a male visitor, whom she instantly discovered to
be the same man, who had been punished by Mr. Mayberry, for mo-
lcating her on the precedingsevening. A purple mark on his forehead
-here the cihe had taken effect when he was felled to the earth, was
very conspicuous, but could scarcely make the revolting and sinister
expression of his countenance more remarkable.
l1e evidently did not know her to be the same person, for whom he
had suffered so severely, but as soon as .she came into the room she be-
came the object of his undivided attention, and Sal who claimed him as
an admirer of her own, was obviously enraged at the preference he
discovered for the new-corer. In the course of the conversation, it
appeared that the name of this unamiable young g man was Joe Bates,
and that by profession be was a "knuck," but what that term signified
Adeline was left to conjecture.
Bet and Sal by the most contemptuous .treatment of Adeline, en-
deavored to lower her in the estimation of Mr. Bates,,but it was too
plain that he was. fascinated with her beauty, and the conduct of the
envious young women gave him so much offence, that he d--d dhem
for a couple of unrcvilized jades, adding some otner terms still more
reproachful and concluded with the following speech:
" I see this young lady has been in good society, and I'll bet drinks for
the whole company, that she can -tell that I've enjoyed the same ad-
vantage, for genteel people can read each other as easily as I can tell
the Jack of Diamonds. Now, I tell you what it is, I'll not see a real
.lady insulted by a pair of infernal dabs like you two, and if you think
that I ever cared a d--n for either of. you, you're cursedly mistaken.
Excuse me, Miss, (to Adeline,) for speaking to you without a regular intro-
duction, seeing that nobody present has politeness enough to do the
genteel thing and present me in due form; but my name is Joseph
Bates, Esquire, and I'm the best knuck in New York City, nind blow
me as high as Mount Atlas, if the first sight of you didn't penetrate me
to .the very gizzard, (pardon me for the somewhat precipitate- decla-
ration,) and if you'll condescend to hear my vows and reciprocate my

THE NEW LOVER.--JELOUSY.

affection, blast me if you shan't dress every day in silks and satins,
and live on pound-cake and champaign, or whatever you like better,
by-- and if that d.-.--d jackass Hickson, or any of his small-ware
priggers, male or female, dares to interfere, I'll smash them by thunder.
I have an appointment to meet some other gentlemen about this hour,.
so I must bid you adieu for the present. When next we meet this bud
of love may prove a beauteous flower. As for you, Sally Jones and
Betsy lIoskins, I don't wish to say anything ungentlemanly to persons
of the gentler sex, but I want you to take notice, that if this lady makes
any complaints to me against either of you, I'll lick you as long as I can
find a square inch of skin on your carcases to plant my fist on."
having made this harangue, 1Pr. Bates stalked out of the room, and
he had scarcely shut the door after him, before Bet and Sal assailed
Adeline with a storm of abuse, which was kept up without intermission
or abatement, until they had finished their preparations for the intended
excursion among the. shops.. Adeline endeavoredto mollify their wrath
by assuring them that she did not inteid to encourage the addresses of
Mr. Bates, and that she would endeavor to avoid him in all time to
come. The infuriated damsels were somewhat appeased ,with these
assurances, and Adeline then ventured to beg them to go without her,,
andto make the excuse that she was veryiill.
"Very ill, are you-?" said Sal with a sardonic smile, "I wish I had'
a chance to physic you. I'd let you see what it is to come between me
and, my sweet-heart. You know Befrthe feller was as fond of, me, as
if I was made all of maple sugar, till this cudfed trollope came along
and tried to cut me out. D---n the hussy; I'll kill her if I have to
hang.for it."
The two confidential friends whispered together for some minutes..'
The only words overheard by Adeline were, "it's a lucky chance that
we can get rid of her any how; let'her slide." Bet then informed her
that she might go, and that they would try to make all right with
Hickson
"But if he won't take your excuse," she added, "you and him must
settle it between you."
"Merciful heaven! where will this end?" though t A decline as she
once more hurried homeward. " Would not a quiet dungeon be better
than such a life of torturing suspense ? I cannot be more degraded
than I am; I cannot despise myself more than I do now. I can never
fall lower; why then .should I resist what is plainly my destiny? I
see DOW that it is ignpossible to hide my guilt ; daily associatio-es with
these wretches must lead to exposure. I will set Hickson-at. defiance.

VISIT TO THE ENCHANTRESS.

Let him  do his worst. I cannot be more miserable than I am. But
my fatherl I must not disgrace him, he could not survive it. If I am
to be a thief I need not be a parricide. I will cease to be an inmate of
his house; I will no longer be known by his name. Any home is good
enough for one who stands in momentary dread of the State's Prison,
any name is good enough for a criminal and an outcast. I will change
my name, abandon my home, disconnect myself from my family, forget
what I have been and reconcile myself to what I am."
While these thoughts were passing through her mind, she chanced to,
recollect 'a conversation, which she had once heard between .Bet and
Sal, in which one of them spoke of a certain Jewess, who possessed the
art of changing the complexion, the color of the hair, and other items
of an individual's personal appearance, so that the person who under-
went the transformation, could not be known to his or her most in- i
timate friends.
This skilful Jewess was in high repute with the thieves, counterfeiters,.
house-breakers, pickpockets, and others of the same. dangerous class,
for many of them had escaped detection by means of the metamorphoses'
which the female Israelite had taught them how to make. When Ade-
line heard the conversation aforesaid, it occurred to her, that by the
aid of the Jewess, she might so disguise herself as to avoid the danger
of recognition, while associating with the vicious people among whom
her strange fortunes had thrown her. Fortunately, (as she thought,)
she remembered the place mentioned by the girls, where the Jew woman
was to be found, and she resolved to seek an interview with her, without.
delay.
Accordingly she proceeded to the cell of the Israelitish enchantress,
which was situated in a small street near the East river. The woman.
was called Mrs. Ramoth ; on enquiring for her by that name, Adeline was
shown a small wooden house, painted red, with curtains of excessively
gay calico at the windows and other symptons of the eccentric taste of
the occupant.
Mrs. Ramioth was a very corpulent lady,'with a decidedly Jewish
physiognomy. She was showily dressed in a calico wrapper almost as
flashy as the window curtains, and a profusion of'gold or gilded orna-
ments on her per on. When Adelin~e had made known the object of
her visit, Mrs. Ra oth promptly undertook to make her "so much not
like vat she wash, dat her own muzzer would tink it wash ,somepody
else."
The price charged for this service was ten dollars, which Adeline
promised to pay at her next visit, leaving a bracelet, (the fellow of her.

frst gift to Uickson,) as a pledge for the fulfilment of ,biW ,bligation..
Mrs. Ramoth then gave her several vials, one of which entdneI a wash
for her face and hands, the second held a hair dye,. the their a prepar
ration to obliterate moles, &amp;c. She also instructed her how to iress im
order to disguise her figure, and gave her advice with respect to her gait,
the manner of carrying her head, &amp;c., &amp;c.
Adeline was naturally of a very-fair complexion ; the wash given her
by Mrs. Ramoth, was intended to give her skin a brown or swarthy
hue ; the natural, color of her hair was a light chestnut ; Mrs. Ramoth
:Formed her that the dye would change it to a jet black. The old.
lady, moreover, gave her other directions, intended to make an apparent
change even in the cast of her features and the expression of her counte-
oance, indeed, the art of Mrs. Ramoth was almost miraculous, having
been inherited from her Asiatic ancestors, some of whom l ad been among
the most astonishing jugglers and wonder-workers of the East. Every
thing having been provided for the intended transmutation, Adeline took
leave of Mrs. Ramoth and proceeded homeward.
On the following day, Adeline received the quarterly sum, which her
father allowed her for the purchase of clothing, &amp;c. This sum as we
have stated elsewhere, was three hundred and seventy-five dollars. As
roon as this money came into her possession,,.she made preparations for
leaving her home, according to the resolution, which she had already
formed. Part of her plan was to take boarding with Mrs. McFadden,
And to improve the condition of her humble friend, by enabling her to
hire more commodious apartments, and to furnish themz in a plain bud
comfortable manner.
A great part, of the day was spent in weeping and lamentation on
account of the necessity, which drove her from the home of herbchild-
hood, and it was almost night, when with ~a small package under her
srm, containing a few simple articles of clothing, the daughter .of the
"merchant prince''forsook the. superb residence of -her father, and
sought to hide her guilt and shame in the obscurity of a hovel. But
before she left her home forever, she deposited the following letter on
L   her dressing table.'
"Ay dearest Father. A dark cloud Irangs oyer me ; I cannot escape
from the fury of the tempest. Believe me, that Iam more unfortunate
than guilty, and let that thought conifort you for my absence. Oh ! my
father, I know that I am about to- bring sotrow to your old age; but

grace / am about to sacrifice myself. I have committed an act, whici

Your wretched and unwoorthy child,
.                A]hLIKE.'
The events of the next two weeks, may be related in a very few
words. Adeline having left her father's house, fixed her abode in the'
humble dwelling of Mrs. McFadden. She had made use of Mrs. R-
moth's assistance and transformed herself in such a manner, that she
could venture abroad without much fear of being known by her former
acquaintances
She was cormipe     yickson's authority, which she dared not dis-
pute, to assist Bet and Sal in storerobberies. When she went but in
company with one or both of these girls, they would steal the goods and
adroitly transfer tiem to Adeline's possession. It was her part of the
duty to. take charge of the plunder, and with-a view to the promotion
of this object, the practiced thieves caused their novice to wear dresses
constructed especially for the purpose of concealing stolen articles. In
this way, Adeline incurred more danger than her artful companions,
although they were the active plunderers, for if the party had been sus-
pected and searched, the goods would have been found on her, and the
ether girls Would probably have disclaimed all knowledge of the
matter.
She was compelled. much against her inclinations, to pass some part
of her time at the dwelling place of Bet and Sal. One day while she
rwas assisting those girls in removing store-marks, &amp;c., Joe Bates en-
tered and agluted her with his usual gallantry, but scarcely vouchsafedd

'i supercilous-nod to her two companions.: The attentions of this yoimi
man, were amopg Adeline'a greatest annoyances. She seldom made any
answer to his fine speeches,' or, took any ntice of his civility, but Jo
seemed to think it imposible that she intended' to give him a serious
repulse, for in his own opinion his fascinationswere irresistible.
"Aha," said he, "I ,see old Ramoth has been at work on you. She
could not spoil your beauty, only changed the style of it. You were
formerly the most enchanting blonde in creation, now you are the most
heart-breaking brunette."
He then turned to Sal and ordered her in the most imperious tone to
go to a neighboring "hotel " and buy him a pint of brandy.
"And' don't think,' said he, " that I'm going to treat you or Bet'
for you belong to the plebeian order, and I cannot compromise myself
by drinking in your company. This angelic creature and myself, being
of a more elevated and refined nature, will quaff the nectar together."
For a moment, Sal's eyes gleamed with "pernicious fire, but with
an effort she assumed an appearance of good humor, ,and taking ade-
canter from the cupboard, she was about to proceed on her errand, but
after opening the door, she closed it again and addressed her faithless
lover:
Joe, you are mistaken, if you think I'm troubled about you
changing your mind. If you like Suke better than me, make much of
her. I'd swap all the claim I've got on you, for a pair of shoe-
strings."
Mr. Bates answered only with a contemptuous smile, expressive of
his unbelief that Sal. cculd give him up without a severe struggle.
While she was gone after the brandy, he remarked that it was " d--d
queer that a girl of that sort should mistake a few civil speeches for any
thing more serious."
Bet in defense of her absent friend remarked:
"Joe Bates we all know that you are a deceiver. It's the way with
all you handsome fellers. You don't know your own minds for two
days together. Suke will soon find you out."
YHere Mr. Bates laid his right hand on his bosom, andgave Adelins
a glance expressive of unalterable affection. Had she been at alln
sible of the ludicrous, she mst have smiled at this pantomimic display of
his feelings. But Adeline was never known to smile after the fatal da~
when her first crime was committed, 'and her life of servitude aind
suffering commenced.'''
Sal soon returned with the liquor, an d placed a dlecanter and
two wine glasses on a table, between Adehne and Joseph B~ates.

Taa MURpER.
The. ardent lover poured out a bumper of the fiery liquid and
urged her to drink, but she positively declined the offe.ng, at
which he seemed to be very much surprised and a little offended
He consoled himself however by drinking glass after glass of the un-
diluted liquor.
Soon, however, some unpleasant thought seemed to force itself
on his mind, and he held a glass of the brandy in his hand and tasted
the fluid deliberately.
"This stuff," said he, "has a deuced queer taste. Sal, it strikes
ne that you must have put bitters in it. Eh ! did you not."
"Yes," answered Sal with a burst of ferocious rage, "you've got
your bitters youfalse-hearted rascal, and all that I'm sorry for is that
your new fancy-gal didn't get hers."_
"«What do you mean ?" said Bates, turning .as pale as the deeply-
dyed crimson of his complexion would admit of. " What have you
been doing with the brandy."_
Only put an ounce of strychnine in it," answered Sal, " and if
you've any account to settle-in this world, the sooner you get about it
the better.".
"Yes, I've one account to setttle," replied Bates, as he drew a
pistol from his bosom and fired at Sal across the table. The ball
entered her bosom and she seemed about'to fall, but Bet supported her
in her arms.
"Ydu've killed me for nothing after: all," said the dying girl,
"I only put a little extract of tansy in your drink meaning to
frighten you. Make your escape, Joe. I don't wish you to be hanged
on my account. If yo- had killed that gal too, I. should have been
satisfied. My curse upon her! it's all owing to her that I'm cut off in
my sins."
A stream of blood poured from her mouth and stopped her
utterance. The murderer without waiting to see the final result of
his deed rushed from the house, but scarcely soon enough to avoid
a police officer, who hoard the report of the pistol and. quickly made
Disappearance at the tragic scene. After~ a few spasmodic movements
the wounded girl expired.
Tlhe officer arrested Adeline and Bet, the only persons found in the

"WOMAN KILLED. A young woman named Sarah Jones, was
shot about nine o'clock last night, by some person- unknown, at a
house of suspicious character in Star Alley. She died almost immel
diately. Two girls named Betsy iloskins and Susan Baker, who
are supposed to have some knowledge of the murder were arrested and
will have a hearing this morning."
Who that had any acquaintance with Adline Fosbenner, could
have imagined that she and the "Susan Baker " mentioned in the
foregoing paragraph, were one and .the same person? At the In-
quest, she and Bet gave in their evidence, but the murderer could
notbe found, and as the victim was a person of little note, not much
search was made after the criminal.
The wretchedness of Adeline was increased, if possible by thiB
tragic event. The "dying curse which had been pronounced against
her, constantly rang in her ears. Though she was really not charge-
able with any participation in the murder, her morbid fancy made
it appear that she was guilty; for, (to follow her own reasoning,) if
she had not committed her first theft, sho would not have been
thrown into the company of Bates and Sarah Jones, and then the
former would not have become a murderer, and the latter would not
have been murdered.
Such reflections made her more desperate. than ever.  She felt
that she should never enjoy peace of mind again, and this assurance
made her more reckless in pursuing the course of ife, which fate, as
she supposed, had ordained her to follow. Shosoon began to-find some
relief in the excitement of pilfering, and for some weeks she engaged
in it with i sort of phrenzied enthusiasm.
But another change came over her. The truth is, perhaps, that
the phrenzy, the moral insanity, which had possessed her, began to
abate. Suddenly she became scrupulously conscientious. She wept
for -her past deeds and prayed for heavenly assistance to preserve her
from future sins'of the same kind.
In the meanwhile her health was seriously affected; she had fre-
quent and violent pains in the breast, fainting fits and other symptoms
which physicians suppose to indicate " disease of the heart."
The experiment of changing her personal appearance, under Mrs.
Ramoth's directions, was so successful and her disconnection from.
her family and former acquaintances was so complete, that the gxieat
object of her dread, identification and, disgrace, was in a great measure
obviated.

58                   MURDER OF HIC8ON.
.If arrested under her assumed name and. altered appearance, she
thought she might he tried, sentenced and imprisbned without' being
known as Adeline Fosbenner, and so long as her. family name was
concealed, the legal punishment to which she was liable, seemed to be
nore desirable than otherwise, as she believed that imprisonment would
be more tolerable than'her present condition.
She was therefore prepared to throw off the iron rule of s ickson,
ja nd she resolved to do so, at the next interview with her tyrant.
When he made his next call to demand the' produce of her ''week's
work," she had nothing to give him.
He reproached her in the bitterest terms. She heard 'him with
apparent indifference, ie attempted to influence her by a repetition
of -his former threats, but she was still unmoed and plainy in-
forined him, that nothing would ever induce her t steal any more.
During this altercation, Mrs. McFadden was 'employed in cooking
her supper.  She had listened with increasing Wrath to the abusive
language which Hickson applied to Adeline.. But the affair was
now reaching a climax. Adeline whose patience, for a long time,
teemed to withstand 'every provocation, had made no reply to the
Villain's 'scurrilous -language, but at length,-she seemed to' be aroused,
and in- a somewhat defiant tone, repeated her declaration that she
would never steal again.
This excited Hickson's rage to such a degi-ee that he struck her,
e and was about to repeat the blow, when Mrs. McFadden interposed
nd received the blow on her own person.  ith no very light hand,
she returned it, and the cowardly ruffian drew' a dirk or dagger,
ahid made a thrust at Mrs. McFadden, who grasped the "skillet,''
a cooking utensil of solid metal, *hich she had just been using, and
While- Hickson stiil pressed 'on her with'the dagger, she dealt a well-
directed blow with the -skillet, at. the caitiff's 'head, and as the Irish
woman's strength 'was prodigious Hickson's skull was crushed by the
stroke.
ieT snk on his knees, the bl od streaming from  the terrific gash
and ;his -limbs quivering with -the convulsions of death; but he
truggled to recover his feet, and actually rose once more to a standing
position, presenting one' of the most frightful spectacles that thought
can conceive, throwing out his arms and' clutching at his head, which
asan indisdn guishable niss- of blood and carnage so completely-
hady it been derhiolished by the forced of' the woman's ar~m and the
N~eight of the instrumentn. At length he sank on-'thie" floor, an

of the room was absent,..while the man received his fatal injuries ot
her premises.  Adeine wished to produce this impression, and shyG
said nothing to correct the error, as she ,had determined, no. matter
At what hazard to herself, to shield Mrs. McFadden from danger.
In .answer to enquiries made by officers of the law and others, who
soon gatheredin the room,,Adeline said:
"You see as much as, 1 do, judge for yourselves. You will not ob-
taii any information from me."
Such - answers -of course, were calculated to fasten suspicion on
herself. ,In fact, she was taken into custody and after a short hearing
was fully committed to answer the charge of murder, as lickson was
uite dead before the arrival of the surgeon.
Leaving her in prison, and in danger of being convicted of the
highest crime punishable by human laws, we must now take notice.
of some prior transactions, an account of which will: be.necessary to er
plain the following pages of this narrative..
Ever since Adeline's disappearance from her home, the nost.diligent
search had been made after the lpst daughter. Her brother had
been summoned from college to assist in this search, and Mr. Charles.
Mayberry engaged with equal zeal and activity in the same duty, but
all their efforts were unrewarded with success.
The letter which Adeline had left on her dressing table, convinced
her friends that her mind was disordered. In that letter 'she had
charged herself with theft.
Her relatives thought it impossible that she could have comipitted
such a crime while' in possession of her senses. :They believed that
her gudt was imaginary, a creation of her own mind under the in
uence of melancoly insanity. But her interview with the strange
man i1, Umion Square, and the control which he, evidently had over
her, might have made, them suspect that there was-so e truth in her
self-accusation. Yet any one might be excused for doubting that a
young lady, who. like .Adeline, duly estimated her, soni. position, and
indeed was proud of it, a young lady, who enjoyed all the comforts
apd luxuries, .hich wealth. a afford, could be. tempted to, commit
the most despicable and degrading of all crime, uness. she Was in-
fuenced by some species of insanity. ..
When Mr. Fosbenner assisted~ liy his son and Charles 'Mayberry had:
continued his search after Adln for.neorly'two months, without aiy
prospect of successs, he determined t~o call ora. me for counsel, as 1
had gained some notoriety by prosecuting a, somewhat .similar search,
severall years before, and my~god fortune 9n. that occasion, made the&amp;

three gentleman hope,' that I might 'be equally sucessful in the present
instance.
Accordingly they came to my rooms one morning, and stated all the
circumstances of the case. At my request they furnished me with a
written description of Adeline's personal appearance, and in the course
of conversation, the last letter written by her .to 'her father happening
to be 'mentioned, I desiredto see it, and as  Mr. Fosbenner had it with
him, it was instantly produced. . I gazed at.the writing-for some minutes,
satisfied that I had seen a similar manuscript before, 'but in what circun-
stances I could not immediately recollect. Suddenly I remembered the
note purporting tocome from some girl,'living in Church Street, who
desired to have my advice. As I had put that note on file, I now brought
it but and compared it with the: letter;, whidh, had just been handed' to
me by Mr. Fosbenner. The writing was identical." On that point there
could be no mistake ; for, as I remarked once before, the .beauty and
feminine' grace of the chirography, surpassed everything of'the -kind,
that I had ever beheld,
"I think, at- least, it is possible," said Ito Mr. Fosbenner, "that
I have some clue to the whereabouts of your daughter. There may
e some mistake in the matter, however, and I advise you not to be too
sanguine in your expectations. If 'you and these. other gentlemen will
accompany me, we may soon ascertain whether my conjectures con-
cerning her present place 'of abode are correct or otherwise."
They all gladly consented to go With nre without delay,: Accordingly
I conducted them -to the iouse in Church Street which had been deilig-
n'ated in the note I had received, as the place to which an answer might
be addressed'. When we arrived at the spot, it appeared to'be the scene
of some confusion. Groups of people stood 'on the pavement, hear the
door and even in the entry, apparently engaged in discussing some sib
ject of general interest. 'I surmised from this circumstance, 'that soine:
thing extraordinary had occurred at "the 'place.  We iade our way
through these knots 'of debaters, to a room on  the first floor, from which
the furniture had been removed'and two stout women,  with a tub of 'hot
water between them, were engaged in scrubirig alarge' space in the
boards, which appeared to have been stained with blond. Glancing: at
my companions, I- observed that: they were very much affected, and' in-
deed, greatly alarmed at this 'spectacle. I addressed myself civilly 'to
one of the women, and 'aked:
"Can you inform me 'where the people 'are who lately occupied th~is

"Yes, indeed, she had, two childer; and very pretty ones I must
allow, although their mother was a she Bizebtb."
"Was there anybody else living with her ?"
" Ay !'she had a boarder."
"Man or woman'?"
" A girl, and a very good-looking one-tco and she's the very one that
killed ould Ilickson.".
"Do you know her name."
"Very likely she had a dozen names to suit her convaynience, but
Bet Hoskins, her crony, told me that her common name was Suke Baker."
I now remembered that the. initials mentioned in the note, to which
my ,answer was to be addressed, were S. B. So far' we seemed to be;
on the right track. As the woman seemed to like the subject and gas
waiting for more questions, I asked:
"Was not this Suke Baker of a light complexion ?"
"Divil a bit, she was as brown as a bunn."
"Her hair was of a light brown ?" said I..
"No, it was as black as ink, ,or her own heart, may the divil con-
found her."
This intelligence afforded the gentlemen who were with me great
relief. In fact they were now certain that 'the girl we ,bad been en.-
qiring after, could not be Adeline. But I was not quite satisfied on
this subject and I ihow remembered a paragraph, which had appeared
in the papers of the preceding day, and in which it was stated'that
Susan Baker had been committed on the charge of murdering John
Hickson. It occurred to me that by visiting this Susan Baker in prison,
we could easily ascertain whether she was or was 'not the person we
sought. lMy oompanion&amp;,Shough they bielieved that I was on~ the wrorg
trail, readily agreed to accompany me to the prison. On our arrival
there, my professional character enabled ue~to obtain permission to see
the prisoner, and we were conducted by one of the keepers to her
apartment. On entering we ;saw a young girl reclining in pensive
attitude on a settee ; her hair was dishevelled 'an'd partly concealed her
face, and she seemed tot be so much abeorbed in her own reflections,

that our entrance was unnoticed. I looked at Mr. Fosbenner and the
two other gentlemenn, but could see rio signs of recognition. Then I
began to suspect that I was really mistaken in the whole matter, but ink
order to obtain a view of the' girl's face, I repeated the name by which
she had been committed:
" Susan Baker."
She looked up, uttered a scream or rather a cry of agony and then
covered her face with both hands.
"cThat is not my daughter "said Mr. Fosbenner in a low tone, "her
appearance is totally different."
Frederick and Charles Mayberry, however, looked at her with earnest
scrutiny. Her disguise perplexed them for a moment, but after ert.
changing a glance with each other, they simultaneously exclaimed:
" It is Adeline, it is my sister."
The elder Mr. Fosbenner hastily advanced, took her hand, gently ro,
moved it from her face, and after gazing on her features, cried:
" It is indeed my poor child. Thank God that we have found her.
Speak to me my daughter. Fear nothing, all is forgiven. (some to
my arms, anaslet us once more be happy. Come with me, you have been
too long in this horrid place. Speak, for heavens's sake,,speak to me."
She had swooned. The paleness of death was on her countenance..
The exclamations of grief and alarm uttered by Mr. Fosbenner, brought
several persons into the room. The keeper's wife chafed Adeline's tem-
ples and used other means to restore her. A physician who happened
to be visiting at the. prison was called into the apartment. lie ex-
amined her condition and, remarked:
"This girl is suffering under'cardial disease ; you should excteher as
little as possible. Violent emotions in such cases as hers are dangerous."
After some time, Adeline was restored"to consciousness, She grasped
Mr. Fosbenner's hand in both of her owyn and exclaimed:
" Oh ! my father, what have you done!. I hoped to suffer and die
without 'being known, but you have deprived me of that last consolation.
Disgrace is now certain, it will fall on our whole family. By what
dreadful mischance did you discover my secret?  In little time I
should have been safe, safe in a dungeon, and the name of Adeline Fos-
bonner would 'never have been coupled with infamy. 'But new all will
be 'known, and death itself will not shield me from that share, which I
feared more than imprisonment, torture or any punishment, which the
eruelty and injustice of men, can inflict on me."
" Do not reproach~ me, my dan.ghter," said Mr. Foshenner,e deeply
.fected, "I have indeed done wrong, but my anxiety on yorr amount

The, physician'observing that the presence of Adeline's relatives kept'
her in a state. of egcesgive agitation, advised them to withdraw. The
room was soon clearec'of every person except the prisoner, the physician.
and nyaelf. Ve soothed: her with the mntle language of sympathy,
and when I made myself known to her and promised her with confidence,
thatI could bring her through all her troubles, that I had in fact; been
engaged by her father to advise and befriend her in this emergency
she voluntarily. gave me: an account of her sufferings, her temptations,,
her sins and repentance. The narrative was interrupted by many tears:
and sobs, and I observed that she seemed disposed to magnify her own
errors, rather than to conceal or excuse them.
In the meanwhile, Mr. Fosbenner accomipanied by his son and Charles.
Mayberry, visited the offices of the different newspapers, and the olds
merchant by liberal donations, induced the publishers to suppress aP
accounts of the identification of Susan Baker, with Adeline Fosbenner,-,
which might be furnished by their reporters, several of. whom were
known to have been in the apartment of the prison, wherehsdert
fication took place.
But one paper, a weekly sheet of detestable character, was overlooked
The news collectors of that sheet had-been' among the crowd, whichin5
traded into the room and witnessed the affecting meeting between father
and daughter, which wne' havei.described. This scandal-monger ein
ployed himself through the whole day, in endeavoring to trace the his.;
tory of Adeline, during her'  absence frpm her father's house. He ob-
tained very little information on that subject, but his depraved fancy
supplied all deficiency of facts. According to the customs of his tribe,
he perverted and aggravated everything that bore any resemblance to
truth, and by adding much that wa absolute y false, he contrived to
make' out a story and earn the wages of iniq ity on which he lived,
The paper containig this monstrous tissue of f1~sehoods, was published
the next ,morning, and- a copy of it was brought by the keeper's wiff
into the room of thie prison where Adeline was confined. This woman
afterwards declared 'that the article relating to the prisoner had 1geex
overlooked by her,, and that when she carried in Adehine'a breakfast, shq
took the paper also, withithe hope that the melaiwholy girl might find

on the heading of one. particular column, where in glaring  capitals ap-
peared the following words:
THE MURDER IN CHURCH STREET.!
WoNDERFUL DISCOVERYI IDENTIFICATION OF THE MURDERESSlI
SHE PROVES TO n3E A GIRL OF WEALTH AND FASHION I1
DISTRESS OF HER FAMILY! !!!
Adeline snatched the paper with 'a convulsive grasp and read on, every
word no doubt striking her with the force and effect of a poisoned arrow.
"Our chief reporter, a gentleman of untiring industry, in his profession; waa en-
gaged through nearly the whole of yesterday in collecting the facts, which we now,
lay before our fifty thousand readers, facts more extraordinary and astonishing
than ever were detailed in the pages of romwnce.
"The girl who was committed for thema.,-ker of John Hickson in Church street,
last-Wednesday, and who has passed under the name of Susan Baker, proves to be
Adeline Fosbenner, a fashionable belle, very beautiful, but infinitely depraved, who
has been for a long time, secretly pursuing a.course of life, unsurpassed in'the an-
nals of crime. She-a has employed herself for years in stealing jewelry and other,
valuables, although the. wealth of her father, placed her out of the reach of tempta-
tion to commit thefts, unless it was done for amusement, or innate love of wicked-'
ness: some months ago, she became acquainted with John Hickson, a poor but
honest man, who kept a junk..shop in Anthony Street, and sihe induced this Hick-
sn by various false hoods, to sell the articles she had stolen, and to take a share of
the;proceeds, making the simpleand unsuspicious man believe that the goods came
honestly into her possession. She also persuaded two friendless young women,
Sarah Jones and'Elizabeth uHskins, to accompany her o' her walks among the
shops, and endeavoredto make them assist her-inher thieving operations, but they
refused .to do so, and abandoned her company as sooin-as they became acquainted
with her character andhabits. At this time, Susan BakeraliasAceline Fosbenner
was the kept mistress of a notorious pickpock#*,named Joe Bates and she left her
father's house and forsook the fashionable society, to which she had so long been
accustomed, in order to carry on her intriguewith Bateswitlhout interruption from'
her family. But becoming jealous on account of some attentions paid by Bates to
Sarah Jones;,who was unacquai ted with his real character, Susan, tia Adeline,
induced her paramour to shoot the innocent and unfortunate girl. In accordance
with this devilish suggestion, Bates did shoot Sarah Jones with a pistol, and killed
her on the spot.' Helted from justice; and his female instigator also, in some way
that we cannot understand,escaped punishment/

boarded, and charged -her with the fact, exhorting her toamenI her wicked course

have her released on bail. Will the publicalliow such a shameful perversion or
justice? We dIo not. approve of -mobbing as general thing, but i this female

bribing th press to silence, his efforts were directed to having her re
noved to her home. My assistance was now required to effect this ob-
jet, which wa 'tended with some. difficulty, as murder, in general, is
not a bailable .oe ce. But wealth can- accornlish much in this cit.
By offering security to a large amount, accompanied by evidence, that
she was laboring under aberration of intellect, we obtained the power to
take her from prison, and to place her under the affectionate care of her
own family. By the wa   it should be remarked that none of us be-
lieved that she h ad anything to do with the murder" of Hickson. There
was no evidence to convict her of that crime, and in fact scarcely at y
ground for suspicion. If the case should come to a trial, I had no.
doubt of her acquittal.
On the next morning after our first visit to her prison, her father,
brother, Mr. Mayberry and myself, went in. Mr. Fosbenner's family
carriage to remove her from that abode of gloom and sorrow to her
proper dwelling place. We tapped at Adeline's door and receiving no
answer    r. Fosbenner and his son gently entered the room; Mr. May-
Ferry and I remaining without, for fear of startling her by the sudden
appearance of so many persons. Soon after we heard the wildest ex-
clamations of grief and anguish' from her father and brother. Mr.
Mayberry and I rushed into the apartment. Adeline was still reclining
on the settee, her head resting against the back rail ; a newspaper was
'clutched in lher hand ; her eyes were fixed and glassy, he!' form motion-
less, in short'she was dead, quite dead. The false and scurrilous pub-
lication she had just read, co-operating with the disease, under which she
labored,  d terminated her earthly existence and placed her forever
beyond th   ach of human kindness or human wrongs.
The sad story is told. My object :n this publicatioaisto do all the
justice that is possible to the deceased. The cruel newspaper slander,
which was the immediate cause of; Adeline Fosbenner's -death, had cir-
culation enough to mislead the judgment of many persons, with regard.
to her real character, and in this way her mnemorfr has .been exposed to
more 'obloquy than it- deserved. In the statement of authentic facts
which I have given, I have viihdicated her from unmerited reproach, with-
out attempting to conceal any of the errors or sins which she really
committed. -Whether a~ was more unfortunate than guilty, let the
reader now judge.
