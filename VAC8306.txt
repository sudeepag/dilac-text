As I entered the school-room, this morning, my
teacher called me, saying: "Violet, do you remember.
it is now the 22d of October, your bir\th-day?"
"0O, yes ma'm,y7 said I, " I should think I would, for
I received from father a present of Peter Parley's.
Tales, and from mother, a very pretty work-box, with
needle-book, scissors, thimble, and every thing I need
to sew with; besides, the girls gave me a number of
whippings, and those I am sure to remember ."
"Let me see," said Miss Manton, "you are eleven
years old now, quite a large girl-almost too large
for a romp, but still you can be of considerable as
sistance to your mother and sisters; and are suffi-
ciently old, I think, to have your school duties en4
larged. Now I am not going to make 'yoau a present,
or give you a whipping; but I shall, in future;. give
you "-here she made a pause-'"something more to
do in your school hours. How would you like that?""
"Very well,"  nswered'I, turning quite red in the

face, as she smilingly bent down toward me for my
reply; but I don't yet know what you would have
me do.
"I would like to have you commence writing a
Journal. It is quite time you began to put some of
those thoughts, which are, knocking at your 'little
heart, on paper. Let us see what they will look like?
Some of them, I expect, will be a little ild; but no
matter; let them come, they will soon be made tame ;
and with careful culture, and perseverence, they may
yet be a pride and honor to you. Commence by
writing this morning's conversation; put down every
thing you remember; write a little every day; then
you will not forget what occurs to you.  Copy it
neatly, and hand it in on Friday morning."
The proposition was not very pleasin ; so I told
her I didn't know as I could sit still lbng enough. I
thought writing was very hard and tedio s, and-as for
having any thoughts to write down, I di not believe
that I ever had any that I could get old of; for,
when I tried to write a letter, so soon as I took p
my pen, my ideas flew away like frightened birds.
0 O," said she, "if that is the case, then it is high
time you disciplined yourself. Ihave long since seen
the necessity of tasking you a little more; for you
find too much time'to look around you, during school
hours. I shall not require any thing you are not
able to perform, nor anything but what will be a benefit,
and perhaps a blessing. After you hav  written in;
that way a few weeks, you will find it quite easy, and
will grew to loving it. In after life, you will revert
to it, as to the remembrance of a dear friend, and will

never forget your teacher's request. Will you try,
Violet ?" said Mis Manton.
" I will," answered I, " but I don't believeJ I shall
succeed."
" 0 yes, you wil," said she. You may take your
seat now and thiin~ on what I have said."
I could scarcely walk up to :my -division, I-was so
full of cry. The task looked like a mountin to me.
The scholars were singing ; I tried to join them, but
soon ceased.. Miss Manton said: "Violet, why do
you not sing with ,the scholars?". Every attempt I
made was useless, my voice grew so husky; my
throat felt as if I ad three or four hard-boiled eggs
in it, standing up  dgewise.
The more I thi k of my task :the worse I;feel.. I
don't want to commence it, any why. i I hdve had
poor recitations al1 day. I cannot keep it out of my
mind one minute, not even at night. I keep dream-
ing-dreaming of it continually. . I do think it is very
hard of my teacher, to require me to write-a Journal!
There are larger  irls than I, upon whom she never
thinks of imposin such duties. There isMry Hart,
who sits near, w o has no more to do than 1 have.
For my part, I do not see why she does not require i
her to work. I r ther think Miss Manton will. soon

The first thing I did this morning
dressing, was to speak cross to little Su
years-old sister, who asked me to get
her shoe-string; I snatched it so rudely
she cried; and when I returned it to h
ugly a manner as possible:
"There Miss, take it! don't you ever
such a thing again! Thenext knot, you
yourself."
When I went down to breakfast, I t

so I spilled the water all the way dow

the table, mother called out:
" Which of you spilled the water a

Carrie answered, (she's always telling

I not to obey her; but she stood

ck to the table my father said:
ay leave the table until we call

you."
That command put the finishing touch to my ill-
humor; and I commenced crying right heartily.
Most bitterly did I repent of my conduct when alone.
I thought of the unhappiness I had- created around
me ; how disagreeable I had appeared to others, and
how wretched I had made myself. I thought too of
the tempting food I had left untasted, consisting of
rice cakes, delicately small biscuits and fresh fish,.
which I love so well ! Every thing tended to increase
my discomfort. My parents seemed to be in earnest
conversation. How I did wish I could know what
they were saying. Pretty soon they all laughed'
heartily.  "What could it be about," thought I.
Then the aggravating rattle of knives and forks fell
fresh upon my ears, as I pursued my unpleasant re-.
flections. "When I return to the table every thing
will be cold and' comfortless ; besides no one will sit
near me, to whom I can smile, or with whom I can
speak, and that is not a pleasant prospect, at all.
This thoughtful conclusion produced a fresh passion
cf tears."

CHAPTER II.
OUR parents are very pious. They
ticular as to our behavior at. home, as v
and when we go to the table, we are o
orderly, and move our chairs quietly
noisy, and rough, that I have to be s
often.
When father says grace at table, w
omits, he wishes us to sit with our hanu
our laps; but just as sure as it is quietly
am sure to laugh, especially if I ought
never could smother it as some do, lbut
outright, so that everybody bears me.
Cousin Joseph, from Buffalo, has b(
for some time ; he is a very pleasant m
but he really delights in tormenting
me, for he knows how easy it is to
laughter or my tears. He sits next me
and I hardly know how to behave wh

whispered something in my ear, whichmade. me titter
till I laughed aloud; when father looked much dis.
turbed, and told me "I mist not sit with them at
table till I could learn to behave properly."
After dinner, mother told me she was very much
pained and mortified at my conduct and example, and
that she was nearly discouraged at making anything
of me. I believe her, for I don't think I shall ever
act like other people. I shall never know how to be
good enough to eat- a meal with the family, when it
is brought in nice and hot.  I declare! I do wish I
as a woman; then I could laugh just as much as t
want to. I don't like restraint better now, than when
I was a little, very little girl. Mother says whenever
she wished to do anything very particular, and di"
not want me in her way, she would resort to tying
me up; but when she did, I was sure to let the whole
neighborhood know it, by my violent screams, and
sraggles to liberate myself, although the line would
be long enough to permit me to visit any part of the
yard.
If cousin Joseph had done right, he w  d have
told father it was his fault, not mine. I did not feet
myself to blame this time- but I did not wish 1to
inform against him, for he is usually so kind to us
carrying us out walking, riding and sailing, besides
he is a great hand at playing ball or. graces; and i,
ever ready to join us.
This morning, I awoke very early, long before
light.  Grandma perceiving me, told me to got
bed again, and when it was time to rise she would
call me. She refused to answer any of my questions

Mother allowed me to stroke her head; it was a l

close into her neck; and right in the middle of her
little head, there was a small place that beat so fast,
it seemed as if one could hear its throbbings. Little

and said it looked as if it were dancing. Then she
cried because Grandma would not let her take the

While we were talking, a strange woman entered
the room, bearing some gruel on a tray, telling us if

vhile, if we wo ld be very quiet. Grandma gaveus

usual, I stumbled over a chair, and made a great
noise, which woke the baby. .She gave a scream loud

Didn't we have a nice time, though,at the break-
fast table ! Father, and all the men h d eaten; so we
had the table all to ourselves.  Sister Annie said, as
she was the oldest, she would play mother ; we all
agreed to it, provided for once we could talk as much
as we wanted to.
When Annie passed me my cup of milk and water,
susie jogged my elbow, asking me to hand her some
johnny-cake; I did not have the c p firmly in my

Now Carrie is just as opposite to -e as possible.
She, is. the neatest little body one  versaw.  She

seldom, she can mend the ren as easily as any woman.
Mother says she will make a good house-keeper by

Annie said she was up the first on  this morning.

all tried to think of some very pretty name for her.,
Susie lisped out, "I thould .like to hiave her named

having been at a school:where I was expected to give
reports as to behavior. When I wished to speak with

quiet;about it. I did one thing which I- well, remem-

just previous to singing, I had become very restless;

CHAPTER    III-
School time has come again, and I don't know that,
I am sorry, for.I am beginning to feel very much in--
terested in study.
Mother says she has found me very useful, the past
week in holding the baby, wiping dishes, sweeping
and dusting.
We expected to have a very pleasant time at vaca-
tion, but our holiday season was saddened by the
death of our dear Grandpa. It makesline feel very
sad. It seems to me, I feel his last kiss even now on"
my cheek.. When . .entered his room I found him
propped up by his pillows; father, mother and aunts
were all weeping. Soon as Grandpa aw me, he put.
his hand out  d drew me toward, hir for a farewell;
kiss. Oh dear it seems so lonely to live without my.
dear, old friend. When I hear little girls callings
grandpa, it makes me start and choke. It was so
nice to be petted by him, to sit on his knee, with hi,
hand resting 'on my head. Our grandpa seemed very;
fond of us, and seemed to try to interest us in many.
ways. At times on going to.school, he would meet:
us, and stooping, would spread put his arms, saying,;
"Come buss your dear father." _, That's the word he;
used when he wished us to kiss him; and he taught
me to say, dear father, and dear mother.. Some of,
the girls laugh at me for it; but J don't care much if"
they do. M4er says I must never blush for doingm.:

and you will hear the company laugh heartily as they
respond: "Well, everything is in admirable confusion
here! It looks like a museum. See here are bits of
colored paper, old drawings, stones, shells, pieces of
old flowers, torn books, broken paint boxes with the
paints scattered all around, broken slates and bits of
pencils, half worn baby socks, and little green shoes,
all mixed in a heap with her clothes."
Carrie's baby house is in complete order, while
mine, mother says, looks as if the witches had been
playing with it. Even when Carrie plays in the sand,
she returns to the house just as clean as when she
went out; the dirt does n't stick to her, but has quite
an affection for me-an affinity as they call it, of the
earth, earthy. I am always playing in it; and it seems
to like me.
I don't know as father ever can\do any thing With
me, as Aunt Katy told mother the other day, when I
caine in the house with my skirt torn half off. I
really do not wonder that she said so, for I always
happen to tear my clothes whin she comes.. Mother
looked very much discouraged, to see my new school
dress rent so badly: I think I had worn it but a few
days, when, in playing " catch," I ran against a board
of the garden fence which was loose. It is strange,
I never see any nails, or boards. I am always falling'
or running over somebody; and if any old lady comes
to visit mother, the first thing she does is to move
out of my way, and if Icome near, she will cry-
"Take care of my corns,' or, "1Oh dear! Violet, you
are always getting on m feet," or, " If there's any

3ek I was hurrying to school when I ran
e iron ball of the faiing belonging to the
Mrs. Brown's house. I was thrown down
force, striking my temple and hurting nme
rs. Brown came out of the house saying-
le dear ! are yoA hurt ?' So she took hold
helped me in the house, bathed my head,
water to drink, then brought me out a piece
,eat. I thought myself fully compensated
,by the kindness. Blessings on that dear,
ady, I shall always love her. Through the
Lool, and two or three times in the night,
would say, "Poor little dear;" I loved to

body looks so funny, so small, just like the fairies I
have read of.           '
Somehow I always forget father's commands with
regard to my going on the roof. After returning
from school last night, I thought I'd just go up for a
little while, to see the sunset, when I said to myself,
" What a good view I could have here of the street,
where I could observe everything going on."  After
resting a moment there, I felt tempted very strongly
to go down to the edge of the roof, so did not re-
member the warning father gave me. I went first to
one corner, then the other; while I was looking
around I thought I saw a gentleman cast his .eye
toward me ; but as he walked along very leisurely,
I concluded that I must be mistaken. Very soon I
heard father call, "Violet." I looked up and per-
ceived him beckoning to me. I. walked up very
-carefully ; ,when near my father, he extended his
hand to assist me in; then he talked very seriously,
and asked me if I knew what I deserved. I remem-
bered v:ell his promise, in case I disobeyed him, and
in that respect received just what I expected, a go od
whipping and an "early to bed."  When I thought
seriously about it, I could not blame him for his fears,
although I had none, and it was quite difficult to
understand why be had any, unless it was because he
is older, and can perceive danger where I do not
dream of it. I cannot say it will make me better as
to climbing, for it is so natural, I forget all commands
when the temptation is presented to rame. .I make a
great many good resolutions ; but when I am enjoy-
ing myself, away they all go, like little birds, just let

ingly; every day is new to me. I have one of the
pleasantest homes a child ever had, and the best and
kindest of parents, also, a darling brother and sisters.
We have very plesant .times together; there's Wil-
liam, Annie, Carrie, Susie and our precious baby,
Ella, six of us; just enough to have a good time. - I
do pity little girls who have no brothers and sisters,
they must be so lonely, with nobody to work or play
with ; why, when we retire at night, we lie and tell
stories to each other until we talk ourselves asleep.
How it rained yesterday ; it was like a torrent ! As
we were coming home from school, it rained the hard-
est. I wore a navarino bonnet; and before I reached
home my crown was washed out entirely.
I remember a severe storm when I was a little girl.
It rained quite hard when we started for school, but
mother did not think it best for us to remain at home,
for we were tell protected with homespun plaid'
woolen dresses high aprons, pantalettes like the
dresses, stout shoes,, ,cloaks, hoods and mittens; so
there was piot much danger'of taking cold, unless we,
were very careless. The storm increased rapidly ;
and when it was time to return home at night, it was
violent. Fatlier was there with. the umbrellas, and
we thought we could get along nicely under his pro-
tection;, and so we did, until we were turning the
corner of the Parade. I being the youngest, father
took me. in his arms! holding an umbrella over my
head. The other he gave to sister Annie, and told
her to walk beside him. Just as we were turning the
corner,, there came a strong gust of wind, which.

We have our tasks to perform daily. .Saturdays
we have a double share of work. Each one knows
her duty. We take turns for each coming week, in
grinding coffee, sifting meal and flour, cleaning silver

call us his little bees; he would say, "That's right,

can we help what is natural? -When my mother is
about to turn her cakes out, I almost put my head in
her mouth, so eager am I to secure the drops. Many s
the one she has broken, through my means, from an

In the Fall of the year, everybody's mother, as well
as mine, preserves fruit for the winter.   One very
lovely day I saw the preparations going on for the
doing up of Quinces, and other good things ; and "0,"

phatically to myself.
When I came home to dinner, I thought I would
step into the cook-house, and take a peep at the quin-

How could I withstand the temptation?
"Oh ! dear! I must have just one taste, a Yvery little

" Take care, Violet! you'll get burned }ere! get
out of the way, Miss Busy-body!" were t.e words
which went in at one ear and out at the other.
"Just one, one drop, mother! I'll be very careful;"
said I.. So I seated myself in a low, old-fashioned flag
chair, with my spoon at the side of the jar.
Some .one was entering the room at the time, and I
turned my head to see; for I can't bear tl e idea of

funny mistakes.

gook-house, and bring in the clothes-horse." After
being absent 'some time she returned, leading a live
horse by the bridle. He was very noisy; and.on his
resisting, she tried to force him up the steps, saying,
"An' indade ma'm, an' he won't come no how."
Another time, mother sent he for the spider; and
she returned after a lengthy time, with a live speci'

We enjoyed ourselves finely last evening before
the lights were brought in. Mr. Linden took Carrie
on his knee ; Mr. Hodges, Ella; and Annie and I
grouped around; while Susie, for a wonder was
mother's baby. The gentlemen entertained us high-
ly by relating, for our pleasure, many anecdotes, and
amusing incidents connected with their own lives,
their own families, and the little girls they had met.
Before we retired for the night they wished us to
say our prayers and verses to 'them. Ella com-
menced her's first. She is very fond of coarse
bread; and when she came to the words, "Give us
this day our daily bread," she added,' " Gaham, Lord;'

as they were to leave Very early in the morning for
their homes.

When I first commenced, it was with. rather a
feeling of sport, not .in ridicule of the observance,
however, but it was not long ere I warmed with my
subject, which was, "Christ blessing little children ;"

shed a few tears by my pathetic entreaties. We then
concluded services with prayer from each member.
After reciting all the prayers and verses we knew,
Susie repeated, "Now I lay me down to sleep." and
concluded with, "Mary had a little lamb;" I could

hard work-to keep from laughing aloud.

doubly interesting. Our father is Superintendent,
and his school is said to be one of the most flourish-

many members. He hhs also an unusually large adult
class, numbering men and women upwards of eighty
years, who barely totter with their canes, and whose

the boy plead thai he might be baptised. He lived
only a few hours after the baptism; and died making

"Why do you wish to be buried there ?" was

did not then observe what she was doing, but saw
very readily when I seated myself. The afternoon
was very muddy. Mary had completely covered the
soles of.her shoes with mud, and stood on the !seat
and desk, after which she had rubbed ink upon it
to drip in upon my books.
No one can .imagine how I felt as she gave me
such an exulting, scornful laugh, and whispered out,
"How do you like that? it looks quite showy,
doesn't it ?"
I felt the blood boiling in my face with anger; the
next minute I was so wounded, it was with difficulty
I could restrain my tears.
"Would I have treated any one so ?" said I to
myself.  "No; never, never !"  My .mind was so
troubled in. regard to it, that I failed in two of my
recitations; and Mary laughed as she gave a sly
pull at my dress as I was being sent down in the
class.
Miss Manton, for the past few weeks, has been
quite ill; and her place has been filled by Miss Free-
man, a lady from the West, who is intimate with the
family of Mr. Hart. Feeling my own inability to
obtain redress, and scorning to retaliate upon Mary,
angered and hurt with the cruel indignity, I went to
Miss Freeman and stated the facts. She said there
must be some mistake; she never knew Mary to
possess such a disposition; she would call her, and
enquire into it.
"Mary Hart, what time did you enter school this,

She then showed me a pencil and picture she had
taken out of Miss Manton's desk.
"Give me some of your drawing -paper will you,"
she continued. I made her no answer, but bent my
eyes to my book, when she said:
" If you don't I wiTl tell Miss Freeman something
about you !" As I took no notice of her, she went
up to Miss Freeman, handed the pencil and drawing
and whispered in her ear.
"The school may stop their recitations," said Miss
Freeman, looking very angry ; Violet Angel, come
here 1"
I started up in affright, and the tears filled my eyes
as I walked up to the platfornt, for sad misgivings of
what Mary Hart had done entered my mind, and I
felt the cruel fate I was to receive.
" Violet Angel, did you take' these things out?"
and she held them up in view of the pupils, as she
added, "and break the school rules by whispering,
asking Mary Hart for drawing paper ?"
" No ma'am," answered I; looking her full in the
face, for by this time. I was completely roused.
"Mary Hart," said I, loud enough for all the school
to hear, "showed them to me, and asked me for the
, paper; and I made her no answer.
"You bold bad girl,"" said Miss Freenan; "what
will become of you?   Was there ever a teacher
punished with such a wicked, hardened scholar as
you are ? I should n't wonder if you would be struck
down dead, any minutes"
Just then several girls in the farther part of the
room, raised their hands. Among them was Winnie

the few first blows, for all at once 1 felling of indig-

school. hours; and' after the dismissal Miss Freeman
remained with me, talking 'very sternly, and waiting
for my petition for forgiveness. But I was not guilty
and could not confess what I had not done. My
mother had implanted in me too strong a regardfor
.truth, even though I be threatened with punishment.
I remember once of yielding through fear; but the,
compunctions I felt afterward could not be described;
and I am determined nothing shall make me swerve
from the truth whatever punishment I have to suffer.
I told her respectfully I had nothing to confess.
Seeing she could not move me she left me in solitude
to commune with my wicked, ungrateful heart, she
said. She hoped and prayed that God would soften
me, and recommending me to the Throne of Grace
locked me up alone. How quiet it seemed in that
large school room, with io other sound save the buz-
zing of the flies, and the beating of my own wild
heart, which was so loud it seemed as if it must .be
heard in the street. I did not feel at all like a culprit
as I sat probing my heart, but like a poor prisoner
unjustly accused and no hope of redress. My resent-
ment and sense of injuries softened into pity-for Miss
Freeman, that she should be so blind in her partiality;,
so mistaken in her judgment.. And for Mary Hart I
truly grieved. How could she be so cruel!- Then
my tears flowed freely! I was so wounded-wounded
almost to death; I sought the Throne of Grace then,
but with far different motives from what my punisher
expected.
It was quite dark when Miss Freeman unlocked the
door. She called me toward her, and asked me if I

had anything to say. I told her no I ad not. She
then gave me a note, requesting me to ive it to my
father. I promised her I would, and ten ran home
as fast as possible; for I was afraid to be out so late,
so far from home, and alone.
When I entered the house, I foun the family with
some company, seated at the supper table. Father,
on seeing me, asked me what had detained me so late;
I made no answer but handed him th note, then hung
my.things up, and with a chokin  heart and sick
feverish body went to bed. There I lay trembling
alone, in this, my first great sorrow. ;It seemed as if
I would grow wild with thoughts of tlhe deep dis
grace, and.cruel unmerited punishment. That thought
for awhile after I laid my head  pon my pillow,
crushed out every other.  Who co ld paint my an=
guish?  One minute my heart tos ing madly with
hatred, bitter and burning, toward the parties, the
next, completely broken down with grief.
"How cai I bear it ?" I would shriek; " How can
I bear it ?" and then, in a state of frenzy, I leaped
from my bed, and wildly paced the room. I had lost
entire control, and was crying most bitterly when
mother entered the room and open wide her loving
arms to me. I rushed to them and obed, and sob-
'bed, until it seemed as if I must die.
Mother did not say anything to  e1hen, but only
stroked my head and whispered: "'ush, hush, my

" Oh ! mother ! I did not do it !" I burst out. "I

then wept with more violence than before.
When my tears subsided I related to her the whole
facts of the day's occurrence, and implored her to go
to the scholars for the truth. I gave her the names;.
and then implored her to tell Miss Manton not to be-
lieve it.
After giving me the promise, she bound up my
stiff, and swollen hands, bathed my aching head in ice
water, uttered a most heartful prayer by my bedside,
kissed me, and told me to compose myself for sleep.

CHAPTER        VI.
I have been very ill; am just getting up. My jour-
nal has been neglected for a long time; it seems to
me an age since I took up my pen. I now hasten to-
ward it as I would to a dear friend, just as my teacher
told me I would. For the past three weeks I have
written a very little each day. I am gaining my
strength very fast. The past seems like a sad dark
dream. I try to forget; but it is impossible to throw
it by.
Mother says, after they left me that sad night, she
was roused by a great noise. She followed it to my
room, and found me so ill with the croup I could
scarcely breathe. They immediately sent for a phy-
sician near by and saved my life. I was also threat-
ened with brain fever. The skin is peeling from my
face and hands; and my hair is cut vei-y close to my
head. Poor Bridget wept and wrung her hands,
when she thought her dear Violet would die; she is
very attentive to me, surprising me often with some
tempting delicacy.
Miss Manton has been to see me. The case has
been examined into. Mary.Hart was expelled from
school, because she would not acknowledge she had
done wrong ; Miss Freenian felt so badly about the
affair she has left for a distant city. She has obtained
a situation as Governess in a private family, I, hear.
Having the croup, makes me think of a time when
I was quite a little girl,

It was in the winter time, when the snow covered
the ground many inches. I was heedless and daring,
as I am now, and like most children, very fond of
the snow. Often at night when returning from school,
we would loiter on our way, (I don't do much better
now, sometimes,) and jumped into all the banks we
could find. At times we would lie in it long enough
to impress our forms; then we would print our din-
ner baskets, measure our feet, or try to make houses
of it. Sometimes, with the help of brother William,
w  constructed a fort, with a snow man as sentinel.
There was a field in which we would stop often, and
where snow would lie in abundance.
One morning when I started for school, I was, suf-
fering with quite a severe headache and sore throat.
I was unable to study all that day, and was glad
enough when our teacher dismissed us.
The snow lay in high, white, tempting banks, on
either side of the street, and to pass it without put-
ting our hands in it, seemed, as I oft n think now,
too great a temptation for human natur to resist. I
suppose I ought to have played blind, until I reached
home; but that was almost impossible. I was com-
pletely fascinated with the beauty. "How much I
have to work with here," thought I, "and it is so
light. The sun has shone upon it, just enough to
render it pliable, without marring or melting it. It
is undisturbed by a single foot-print."
While I was looking, thinking and admiring it, 'ere
I was aware, forgetful of mother's command and my
illness, I was hard at work, building a house to sur-
prise the school girls with oi the morrow. All at

once the approaching darkness reminded me of the
wrong I was committing by disobedience. I hurried
home, and met my mother at the door, anxiously
looking for me. When I spoke to her my voice was
very hoarse. Mother looked very sad as she handed
me some warm drink, telling me I had given her niuch
trouble and sorrow, and that she would have to pun-
ish me by sending me to bed supperless. She knelt
by my bedside and prayed that God v+uld forgive
her little girl for her sinful disobedience.  I could not
rest until I had asked her to overlook it, and the tears
would keep coming all the time I was repeating my
prayers.  In the meantime my cold grew rapidly
worse. I suppose I had slept only a short time when
I was awakened with a sense of suffocation. I could
scarcely breathe, and felt entirely unable to call
mother; but-she heard my loud breathing and put
me immediately in a hot bath, with wet towels around
.my throat, at the same time giving me some medicine.
Before the physician arrived I was considered some-
what out of danger.
The following morning the Doctor called to see
me, he took a chair with a grave "ahem "-seated
himself, felt my pulse, looked very thoughtful for a
half minute, then said in cheerful but subdued tones,
"Well, how does.my little daughter do to-day ?"
I was forced to make great effort even to whisper,
but I answered,'"Pretty well I thank y u; how do
you do ?"
"You are, hey?" and he burst in a  iolent fit of

thank-you."  This is pretty well indeed, so sick you

can hardly speak, and a high fever to boot !"
Since then, whenever he meets me, I am sure to be
hailed with,-"pretty well, I thank you; how do you
do ?" I met him not long ago, as he was walking
with a gentleman. He called out to me as I passed,
and told him of the circumstance.
Mother obliges me to walk every morning. I met
the'Doctor yesterday, who said, "that is right; your
mother knows what is good for you. I well remem-
ber when you all had the whooping cough, your
mother had you out in the sun and air daily, and you
were often choking and coughing in the street;,but
it did you no harm, for you improved faster than any
little girls I knew of."
While I was getting well, then, father presented
me with a lovely wax doll, and my school teacher's
daughter kindly offered to dress it f r me. My good,
dear father, gave me also, a cradle, and a little wooden
house big enough to put the baby ia, and adorned it
with furniture of his own making. My baby house
was in the garret. As the bed-clothes were not com-
pleted, I laid her at night in the cradle bed, with but
very slight covering. One morning as usual, I made
my visit and was lifting her up to Ombrace her with
a kiss, 4s was customary, when, to my great surprise,
I found she was headless, and her little hands and
one of her feet were completely gnawed off. I took
up her head to see if it could be replaced; but the
sweet blie eyes in which I loved so well to look, hung
drooping from the sockets, and one of the ripe-red
cheeks was bitten into, taking part of the mouth that'
never did anything but smile. The mice had been there.

Carrie and Susie came home last night, crying bit-

they, living in the-street where their school is situa-
ted, who molest them-when I fail to accompany them;
lying in wait, daily, to torment and abuse them. The
children usually carry their dinners if it is cloudy
weather, and mother is sure to put up some tempting
thing, rarely failing to give them apples.
For a long time Susie has said, wheni she returned
at night, she was so hungry she could ardly wait for
the supper bell. Last night she made ome such ex-
clamation, and looked as if she had be  crying quite
hard, when mother said:
"How is it you are so hungry? I gave you a good
full dinner, enough I am sure !"
As mother questioned them, they i$eth burst into
tears; and when she insisted upon   explanation,
they wept violently.
Carrie said, "Mother, we, cannot tell you, for we
promised not to ;" but mother said  "it is a bad
promise. You have no right to bind yourself not to
tell your mother,, whatever happens."
Susie then brightened up, saying-K FI'l- te 1 you
mother. Some girls took it away front us before we
reached the school-house.T
Mother insisted upon knowing more bout it when
Carrie made a clean heart of it, and said
"Why, mother, they take it from us very time we
carry it; and then they frighten ids, and whip us if
we refuse. I told them this morning we want d our

imaginations of us youngsters with their singular ad-
ventures, and hair-breadth escapes, their illustrious
acquaintances, their sweet monients of pleasure, and
their distressing hours of sorrow and misfortune
brought on by the cruel war. At times I am just
foolish enough to wish I had been a worker and a
partaker in those stirring scenes; I do so love excite-
ment.
Father says, if it is pleasant to-morrow, he will give
us the desired pleasure. A few of mother's friends
will accompany us.
We were all ready for our sail at half-past two.--
Some of the ladies whb accompanied us were very
much afraid of the water. One of them, who delayed
getting into the boat until we were all seated, seemed
much frightened; and standing with one foot on the
wharf and the other in the boat, said, " 0, Mr. Angel,
I dar'nt go; I dar'nt go. I'm afraid for my life; We.
shall be upset, As sure as you live,"
"0 dear; O dear ! said she every time the boat
moved, "we are going !( Boatman, don't you think
us in danger of striking , rock out there ? What a
foolish woman I was, to leave my home and my chil-
dren, and peril my life just to gratify my curiosityI!
Well, .I shall learn a lesson from this !"
We had a very fine sail notwithstanding ; and after
a while the lady forgot her fears, related many amus-
ing anecdotes, which made us as happy a boatload as
can be.
When we neared the ship we foun   it crowded

We were doomed to meet with another accident
before reaching home. It might have been because
some of us were so cowardly. We proceeded only
a short distance when we lost our rudder. Then
you may be sure exclamations of fear from certain
quarters were quite plentiful;, and even my owa
courage abated considerably.   Visions oame 4p
before me, in a new view of the danger of nights
spent in the open air, on some of those islands. I
imagined myself, like ,Robinson Crusoe, deprived of
cloth s, and fire, subsisting only upon wild nuts, and
rootsand leaves, reduced to such extremities, as to
follow the example of' cannibals, as people do some-.

misfortune and thus relieved us.
Home, home once more! Did n't it seem good?
For once my love of adventure wa     completely
satisfied. Right glad were we to lie down to sleep
that, night. I do not remember of dreaming of our
perils; but the first thing I did in the morning was
to recount our wonderful adventures and escapes to
my teacher and school-mates, who lstened with
attention and evident interest. I suppose I enlarged
upon my subject slightly, though I did not at the time
intend to do so. I must be very careful; for perfect
truth is so much better than momentary display.
Election week has passed. I was not able to walk
with the crowd, and it sorely disappointed me. But
I had the comfort of a dear friend's visit. Minnie
.May, who attends, the same school with myself came
to see me. 0, I do love her ! She is so good. Not
many girls would deny themselves, by staying in of
an election day, to please a sick gi'l!  Mother
thought that I might be injured by the crowd, and
so prevailed- upon 'me to remain at home. I was
obliged to deny myself from eating cal e or candy;
she gave Minnie and the other girl a plentiful
supply; however, I had all th oranges I wanted.
Somehow I feel more hungry on that day than on
any other ; and every body eats then  s though he
never saw any food before, and it was his last chance
for procuring it. I did not feel so badly this time as
I do generally. I suppose it is because I was not
allowed to eat much ; 'and then I ge erally get so
tired walking around all day, seeing thie companies,

and looking at the crowd. Besides, I usually wear a
thin dress, as all the little girls do, and new shoes
which are stiff and often tight for me. Such looking
feet as I will have for a long time; but father says
that for every pleasure we must pay the price, and it
would be well to count the cost before we received
it. The companies from the Fort, the Flying Artil-
lery, and German Band, with one from Providence,
and a conipany from Warren, passed the house
several times escorting the Governor, who was
seated in an open carriage.  He takes his seat on
that dhy, as it is called. As they rode past us, the
children in the street cheered him. He stood up in
his carriage and waved his hat on all sides.
I had quite a good-time after all. Election day, in
our State, occp1rs on the last Tuesday of May;
and we have ou vacation at that time, which makes
it very pleasant. Aunt Katy says, "Lection day is
the most tiresome one on airth," she does n't see why
such a fuss is made about it; and as for the powder-
crackers, whistles and jewsharps, she would like to
make one large bonfire of them, for they almost
crack her ears open with.their noise.
Aunt Katy did not like Carrie's correcting her the
other dlay, when she asked for one of her "reasons,"
which lay in Carrie's hand.
"Not reasons,' said Carrie. "You should say,
raisins."
" Well 'raisin' then," said Aunt Katy, angrily.
"When I was young no little gal was allowed toKcor-

which are generally colored, and make comparions

but I really did so d little less than two years ago. I
am right glad to be old enough to select my shoes;
for I am heartily tired of red and tea olor; I think
violet or black is much prettier for a large girl.
The streets are filled with strangers from far and
near. A great many men come from t ae cities, who
are very respectable and well-behaved then at home;
yet when they get to Newport conduct so badly, I
should be quite ashamed to recognize them as rela-
tives. There is a great deal of intemp rance at such
times ; and the young men imbibe qu'' te too freely.
They sometimes deck their coats, canes and hat with'
remnants of bright-colored velvet rib on, riding or
walking, and singing, and hurrahing, through the,
streets. Sometimes they stop and kiss the girls who'
pass them; then again they will take them up and
run with them, which causes some ala m among the
fair ones. Father thinks it is hardly sate for us to go
without him on the most public streets. When a cara-
van of wild animals is here, we have an addi ional
pleasure; and usually father takes us t see it.
Our parents say that Annie, Carrie nd I m y go
into the. country to-morrow and visit Uncle Thomas.'
Joy! joy ! joy! won't we have a nice ieme. I wish

would have fun, bathing, walking and riding; and

September. It did seem very good to see my parents
and all, once more. We have enjoyed ourselves
much; yet, there has been a want in our hearts, for
so many of our loved ones were absent, and could not
partake of our happiness. I never saw any children,
so delighted with their freedom as Ella and Susie.
They skip and leap, just like the little pet .lamb Uncle
gave to Ella. It's a dear little thing, and already fol-
lows their steps wherever they go, rolling with them
down the grassy banks, or, when tired lying on their
laps like a little kitten. sometimes she will go to
sleep so; and when night comes on she will come at
their call, and lie down quietly on the soft bed of hay
Uncle fixed for her in one corner of the barn. It is
really a pretty picture to see Susie bending forward,
feeding her, and Ella kneeling on the grass, with one
fat arm laid over the curly neck, and in her hand a
bunch of clover blossoms, which the lamb regards
with sleepy eyes, making a feint of nibbling, more
from love of the dear little hand than from any sense
of appetite.
Yesterday afternoon we went berrying in the woods;
and a nice time we had of it. We set off very early
in the morning, taking our luncheon with us.. The
older people rode in the family carriage, while we,
children, in company with. two or three of the neigh..
bor's girls, whom Aunt invited to go with us, rode off
in fine style' upon a load of hay, which was on its way
to a neighboring town. We' were a right merry party,
and enjoyed ourselves finel , telling riddles and puz-
zles, and singing. It soon c me to my turn for a song;

dear, dear friends. Now that we are going, it seems
as if I could not wait to see my dear Grandma, Miss

country and its simple enjoyments. It is so delight-
ful of a warm summer day, to lie and dream in the,
shade of' a broad-winged elm, with the head resting
on a soft green knoll. Then the happy shouts of
laughter, the ringing chorus of glad voices echoing
over the hills, which one cannot hear without catch-
ing the spirit ; the loud caroling of birds, the hum
of insects, and the frolicing of the berry parties, the
picnics, the planting, sailing bathing, walking, and
baying are all charming in their way. In the Fall of
the year they have apple gatherings parties, huskings,
paring bees, and many other simple pleasures. What
I like is, everything is so hearty and full of life in the:
'country. Oh ! these are golden days. Dear old Un.

of water in her hand, and looking very anxious.
"Violet," said she, "I wish you would open the door

You must not co e in now, for the doctor is with
her. Take good c re of Ella, and amuse her all you

I went to Ella, who was sitting ;on the, door-sill, with
her head resting on her hand. She looked up as she
heard my footsteps, and putting her little arms out

is sick; Ella must see dear little sister.".
It was very difficult to pacify her; and every-now
and then, she would plead most piteously to see Su-
sie. They are very fond of each other, rarely caring
for other playmates ; and Susie has felt great pride
when allowed the privilege of' leading Ella down to
Mrs. Borden's. I did all I could to console her; so
at last had recourse to story telling. As sheasked

th as if enjoying a taste. "I know where she
aid them away, too," she continued, as she held
he keys of the preserve closet, jingling them in
ears. "Don't you want to see them? I'll give
a little peep; but we must be very careful not to

fully examining all the good things there. During'
ol hours that afternoon, we thought of nothing

recitations, was to fail, and be sent back to our

the cake, with the great plums, hid the spelling-lessonr
entirely from our minds. At night, previous to retir-
ing, we thought we must have one more peep at the
cake ; we kept turning it and turning it, moving it
on 11 sides. To take one more plum a-piece seemed
irr sistible. They would scarcely be missed thought
we; for the longer we stayed, the stronger the temp-
tation became.
' Mother says," interrupted Ella, ",-we should
tura, away from any thing we covet belonging to
an oher."
Yes, little Ella," said I, "if we had oily remem-
be 6d what mother had taught us, we should have
be n saved much sorrow and wrong. On the follow-
in morning, instead of raising our young hearts with
gr teful praise, to the kind good Father who watches
ov r us, our thoughts were entirely occupied with
th cake. Another cautious peep was had and a few
more raisins were taken. When we had fairly set in,
it vas not long before the cake was entirely covered,
w'th holes. It was no hard matter after that morn-
in 's naughty work, to take each a small piece from
d y to day,.until we had eaten it half up.
One Friday morning, mother met us in the hall, as
w  were hanging up our, bonnets, and said, in her
u ually calm tones:
"Children, I want you to assist me in washing th4
d shes this noon, for Bridget has a great deal to do 
i the kitchen, and I expect a few friends to tea. I
ant you to return home as soon as scl ool is over,

there until I come for you."'

with thick grey hair, brushed up from a full broad
forehead,I bearing on his face the most benevolent
expression, and the sweetest smile I ever saw. He',
too, love little children, and in that respect he makes
me think of our own kear minister; only our's is so
much the older man, very serious in manner,. very in-
firm, and said to be quite near the grave.
Mr.     , of the   -. Church, frequently invites
his singirig class to hi house, where, in his spacious
yard, they make themselves very merry.
I. passed an evening there, not long since, in
company with Minnie, and was introduced to his
daughter, whois but one year younger than our-
selves. She is a very pleasant-spoken, lively, good.
hearted girl. If her father does not leave here, she
will soon attend school.
After tiring ourselves with the play of "Fox and
Geese," and "Hunt the Slipper," Mr.  , who joined
us in our sport, proposed the game of backgammon.
We closed the evening with singing, his eldest
daughter, who .is a fine musician, presided at the
piang.
The time passed delightfully. He spoke with us
on the subject of religion; and presented it in such
a lovely light we felt strong desires to be after God's
own heart..    spoke of God's claiming oir love, of
His affection for His children, of the kindnessew
bestowed upon us, of the great proofs of His care-..
surrounding us, and' the happiness: we would receive,
in striving to follow out His laws, physically, morally
and spiritually.
He Wished us, while our hearts were young and

Oh there is nothing that wells up in my heart with
such yearning tenderness, as a blessing, and a dying
blessing, too. "God bless you my child " is the rich-
est music that ever found its home in the soul, the
gentle fall of which can never, never be lost.
It is a rainy day, a:d I have been very busy in
looking over the contents of my writing desk. I find
there many things to remind me of love. In one box
I have several miniatures. I have one of a dear
grandfather, who bears an unusually kind face. He
has fine dark eyes, brown hair, which is powdered,
according to custom in those days, parted in the mid-
dle, falling to his shou ders, and tied in a cue. He
has a mouth which lcoks as if it was meant only
for pleasant words, yet exhibiting sufficient firmness
to give it character. Rie wears a drab dark velvet
coat with large button , a straw-colored embroidered
satin vest. and ruffled shirt, with his drab breeches
fastened on the knees with silver buckles. I never
had th pleasure of seeing him, for he died when
mother vas very young, but I love most dearly to
gaze upon, his face. Among my miniatures I have
sweet child faces, and cne of a dear friend now very
near death. In. anoth-i- box, I have quite a number
of ringlets, light and dark, and plain locks of hair, all
bearing their seperate names, severed from the heads
of persons who are very dear, I have beautiful,
choice minerals, giver me by different ones, each
giver seemingly anxio s to cultivate my love for the
beautiful, pressed flo ers arranged by dear hands,
made delicate and trer ulous by sickness and grief.
I have many other m mentos of friendship, such as

What is the need of binding one's self to certain
rules upon which to base' our opinions? All cannot
think alike. There's Minnie May who agrees with me
generally in sentiment, but in religious matters our
ideas differ widely. We view things from our own
point of observation, our own individijial perception.
Our education has been different, the circumstances
by which we have been surrounded differ, the differ-
ent medium of mind which receives our thought, com-
pels that thought, to take an opposite color. It seems
to me God would have formed us more alike if He
had intended us not to vary; and if we all wish to
serve Him, what matter for these slight differences of
opinion? We can walk in the same baths even if we
do not resemble each other; we can unite in pleasant
converse, and meet at the same point, though we take
different roads.

He would notice my frightened face, and bowing very

At times he would alarm us considerably, by sud-

"But, father," interrupted Annie.
"Hush," said father, "hear me out. I wish you to
try to cut out your dresses\; I will give you all the
cloth you will require to learn upon, if a dozen pieces
are spoiled by experiment; and you shall have as

They said they were getting old, and probably should
not live long. Aunt Susie was blind and very feeble,
and she united with them in their wishes.
"If I had only a housekeeper, now," said mother,
"I could go. Bridget needs some one to look after
her, and Miss Martin is too old for such a responsi-
bility."
"0 , do go," plead Annie; "I -can leave school a
little time, and take care of the house as nicely as any
one. Say, mother, wont you try me ?
' And, mother," chimed in Willie, "it is a duty you
owe to them. You know Aunt Susie is so chfldish
she will take it very much to heart if you don't go.
I shall have every Saturday night, and will assist in
many duties. Come, mother, you had better conclude

neck.
Miss Martin camb in, and wished to know what the
conference could be about. Mother then told her.
She advised mother to go, by all means, and she said
the children would get along nicely.
What an exciting time the packing business makes

such circumstances, in the present instance I was
doomed to disappointment; for mother had every-

much we do miss her. She writes she is enjoying
herself finely, making many new acquaintances,
visiting places of amusement, sailing, riding and.

long the time seems to wait ! I feel as though I
must fly to her.
To-morrow there is to be an excursion to Conrad's
Cave. The several schools of the town will unite
with ours, starting very early and taking their lunch-

it will not be best when father is absent from home.
Next Saturday they will go to the Lily Pond; and
every succeeding week, when pleasant, they intend
visiting all the places of interest.
Yesterday we had quite a jubilee, a Temperance
pic-nic. As it was held in our vestry, Miss Martin
thought we had better go. Our society is quite'
large, composed entirely of children. We had quite
an interesting time. After walking vin procession
through the principal streets, carrying our appropri-
ate banners, with a slight feeling of pride- at the
display, we repaired to the Church, where we listen-
ed to speeches from several of the ministers, and one
or two earnest workers in the Temperance Cause,
who discoursed most eloquently of the sorrow and
suffering intemperate habits brought upon us. We
had a right merry time. I think nothing occured to
mar the enjoyment of- any one there.

CHAPTER X]

Snow has come again; how glad an I to welcome
it ! It is pleasant to watch it fallin g so gently, so
softly and steadily. Ella seems beside herself with
delight. She came to my room this morning, waking
me up by crying out : "Violet ; oh Violet! do get up
and see the snow. Oh, it is so beautiful! so soft and
white; just like feathers, or little things alive, and
dancing as merry and spry as fairies ! Just look on
the ground, too.! Isn't it the sweetest carpet you
ever saw? Won't we have fun, snow-balling? There
goes a sleigh !  Do look, Violet!   And there 's
another!  0, there's the baker's cart on runners !
I mean to ask him to give me a ride !"
Away she bounded down stairs; and before I could
get my dress hooked, she had mounted the seat, and
was off. When I went down to breakfast, the first,
thing I saw was Ella running up and down the yard
with Willie's sled in her hand, and some bells around
her neck. She inquired of me if she did not sound
just like a sleigh. My heart is so impressed with the
beauty of the freshly falling snow, I feel forced to
give it utterance.

shall do. I was thinking yesterday, mine were out-
grown, and quite shabby.
Father has been visited by a great number of the
Church the past few weeks. They come often to see
him, and seem to be in close conversation.  They
look quite angry while talking. What can be the
reason?
I asked mother to-day, what was the trouble now ?
She says he is being "churched" for entertaining
sentiments differing from their creed ; that father
does not believe in close communion; that he thinks
it is not right for us to deny the Lord's Supper to
any one who sincerely desires it. It has caused quite
a difficulty with some of the most rigid members.
His teachings are considered by them as injurious to
the children. I cannot think so.
To-day. when father addressed the Sabbath School,:
many of the teachers wept violently ; and when they
left, shook hands with him, and plead that he would
still remain their superintendent. Father is told by
the chief members,. that if he will teach what they,
the head, direct; according to their creed, he can
remain with them. This quarreling on account of'
difference of creed, or opinion,:does not look right.
There is a great evil somewhere. I cannot see how
father can be prevented from keeping. the school, if.
he'i turned away from the Church; for the school
was first got up by him, and was sustained mostly at
his own expense.
Well, it is all over with him now. Father would not
consent to teach, otherwise- than from his own
convictions of right.. He was not willing to depend.

ceive things calmly. I fear this affair will spoil me
for the church. I have hitherto had such a great
veneration for it and all its teachings. I have been
rudely awakened from a very pleasant dream, and I
look upon tie members now as only men, very com-
anon men. Perhaps it is for the best. I had placed
them so high in the scale of excellence, the world's
amen could not reach them. Since gratitude, love,
honor, principle, must be sacrificed on the altar.of in-
tolerant bigotry and injustice ; since the Christ is hid-
den behind the door of the church, and selfishness is,
:set up before the people to worship, I must say my
faith is waning, dying all out ; and I. look around in
any helplessness, crying, whom now can we trust,
.since they, our pillars, have crumbled to the dust?
What can we lean upon, what can guide us, since our
lights are sunk into darkness ? All for this mistaken
sense of Christianity, my dear friends "must be aliens
:from home," through this lonely world, groping in
their sorrow:! The faith so warm, so rudely broken,
scan never be restored. It is right, for it may bring
them nearer to the dear Father of all. May od
comfort us, for we feel so alone in our woe.
Father has not been well for some time. I think
this trouble has, preyed upon him. He now seems
threatened with fever-billious fever-the doctor
says. . Je is very ill.
Father's symptoms are worse to-day. The disease
is pronounced-small pox, or rather varioloid. How
I dislike to write that word.! Of all diseases the
most to be dreaded in a family, the mos repulsive.

Father is improving fast. He sat up o-day a short
time. If he continues to do so, he wll remove up
stairs next week. Doctor says a chang of room will
be of benefit to him. Such fun as we have frequently
in drawing up provisions in a basket, 'nd, talking to
our friends across the street. The only drawback
there is, there can be no privacy said, or everybody
can hear us. It makes us feel as if w were in jail,
and pitying friends were bestowing favors upon us.
How amusing it must look to our neighbors.
To-day we had a kiss from father, b t a glass door
separated us. He does not look very much altered.
Such a dust has been raised for a few days! The
whole house is open, and we can.drink in all the air
we wish. Oh ! how' sweet it does seem. We are
having a thorough airing and cleaning  Our carpets,
bed and bedding, which father used, were buried sev-
eral feet under the earth; but we did ot weep much
at the burial. I know they are havin  a sure purifi-
cation. Snow, wind, and rain, with ccasional sun-
shine, have poured and beat fully upon them.
We all went to church to-day, and it afforded us no
slight amusement to see how soon we had the side-
walk by ourselves ; and those on the_ ther side were
afflicted with such a sudden cold in t eir heads, that
their handkerchiefs were indispensable. Such a scat-
tering as there was when we went up the steps. We
found plenty of room to navigate. almost wanted

to shout, the "C''mpbells are coming, Oh, ho! Oh,
ho!" or the " Lpers." We took our seats in the
gallery, but even from that distance there were many
who seemed as i they feared they would not reach
home alive. Th sermon was not very effectual that
day, if we may judge by the timid, glances and restless
movements made by the congregation. The text
should have been ''"Contagion."
To-day we resumed our seats in school. My teach-
er seems delighte to see us, but the girls appeared
very much alar oed, and even Winnie Wright, I'
thought, spoke quite coldly. I put my hand upon my
new seat-mate's shoulder to. inquire where the lessons
were, when she  oved very quickly away, as far as
possible from me, and said, in a tone of indignation;
"Whiy, Violet Angell, I should be ashamed to speak
to anybody. I mean to tell my mother ! I shouldn't
wonder if I had taken the disease ! So she went off
pouting, and reported me to Miss Manton, who only
smiled in answer.
Oh dear, it is trouble again, nothing but trouble,
now before us. One misfortune has only opened the
way for another. How I wish Minnie would return,
I do so wish for some one whom I can trust, to open
my heart to. Really, it is becoming very heavy. I
try hard to shake off these feelings, and hide them
by my usually light, happy exterior; but if' father is
unhappy, 'how can I, if I allow myself to have any
sympathy, help feeling and suffering with him. -You,

else? If I do trouble you, you have never revealed
it to me; and your covers are ever open like the
arms of a loving friend. I do not know what I
should do without you, it is so sweet to lay my
sorrows here. I feel as though I had thrown half
my load away. Since father's recovery, he finds it
impossible to collect in his heavy debts. If he only
could, we could pay all, without any sacrifice of pro-
perty, and still remain comfortable. Business is dull:
banks are failing; and father fears he  ill break also.
Another little one is added to ourcircle, a dear
brother. He has ehone just whonwe feel as if we
could not receive him. I feel so sorrowful I do not
know how to welcome him with gladness; but Ella,
like all little children, is evidently delighted, and is
already trying to make herself useful by amusing and
holding him. We will try to love our baby stranger,
it will not be very hard, and shield hinr all we can by
our affection from the heavy clouds surrounding him.
He is a darling dark-eyed boy, plump and pretty, with
an abundance of straight, dark hair.
Mother lies tery low, and is no   expected to
recover, The rooms are al darkened; the knocker
is idffiled, and we have to walk with a stealthy tread,
when engaged with our duties. They told us yester-
day we must expect to lose our mother very soon.
The thought is too agonizing to bear for a moment.
I will not accept the supposition, but wYill inspire her.
with all the hope within me, until she is called to
lie in the VALLEY OF DEATH. I. feel impressed she is
dot to leave us yet. May God grant our prayer !

and poor all of us. May we now have assistance
from a higher source in this our time of greatest
need!
Ever thing that can be gathered around our dear
home, books, that we value most highly, our few
treasures, our comforts, even things that belong to
our necessities, are to be put up to the highest
bidder.
Several' of our friends are angry with father,
because he will not transfer his property to them,
under cover of their protection, until the affair is
hushed up; but father is too strict in his integrity to
bow or bend to such temptation.
Most of our creditors are very gentlemanly and
kind; but a few were so greedy, they hardly wanted
us to keep the bare necessities of life. One person
even strongly urged taking up the carpet of the
room  where mother lay very sick.  I was told,
gentleman said to the man, he should walk over his
dead body before he would permit him to perpetrate
such an outrage.
Willie has been obliged by our common misfortune;
to leave College. He has procured a situation ii
Philadelphia. He will leave home next week for the
uncertain comforts of a stranger. Poor boy! What
a disappointment is his! For awhile the novelty of
his position will occupy his attention. After that has
died away, and every thing around him becomes
familiar, then how strong will be the yearnings for a
mother's soft hand to rest upon his brow with :gentle
words, and a fat er's earnest, well-timed, counsel.

the faults of others so easily, and are inclined to be
rude also. Kate has called here several times for ,m
to walk with her; but father did not think it best for
me to go."
"How strange !" said Jane, "your father should do
so, when they are so wealthy ! She would not come
to see you now; for your father's failing makes a
great difference to your position in society, especially
as you are growing older. You would n't be received
any where, and-."
"0, as to that," interrupted I, with a slight tone of
anger, "we never pretended to ape fashionable
society, and never mean to, let our condition be what
it mnay. We always intend to cultivate the society of
the intelligent, the educated, and the good. Father
often says if we were as rich as Croesus, he would
rather see us sleeping beside his father in the grave-
yard, than following the absurd, life-destroying follies
of. the day, crushing all. that is noble out of use and
making woman merely a simpering doll-baby.'
" Well," said. Jane, laughingly, "you are in for the.
big talk, at any rate. I should think you might ghe
a lecture to the public, you feel so warmly upon the
subject; and I'll get up a subscription for you. It is
likely you will find use for it," she continued, with
a slight sneer; "however, I have not come to
quarrel with yoti.
"But Jane," said Annie, who took no notice of the
last remark,, so intent was. she upon what was first
repeated to her, "I do n't know why property should
make any difference. The losing of our comfortabl&amp;

I was standing in the door-way bidding good-bye
to a friend, when Jane, who was returning hoie
from seool, ran up the steps; and to' avoid beig
seen by er sister, who was coming up street, stepped
behind he door. This roused all the pride of my

to go her way, and I would go mine; for after what
had bee said, I did not care to renew the acquaint t-
ance. I conclusion, I reminded her that there wee
a few, who were, left to us, who loved us for our-

the contrary, they who have fed at our own table
and partaken with us of our simple pleasures, reward
us only with a timid glance, or the col stare of-"I
do not know you."
While walking down street this evening I met Su-
sie and Carrie Edgar, with their friend  ill Haywood.
Being acquainted with both parties, nd forgetting
the distinction a few dollars makes in the feeble minds
'of some individuals, I was, as usual, prepared to meet
them yery cordially, but they merely gave me a side
glance, and then suddenly perceived something ex-
tremely interesting to look at on the other side of
the way.
When the heart of such an individual is opened to
'sny view,' exposing to the full light these little etty
?foibles, my yearnings for the society of such all die
out, no matter what their attainments or attractions.
:I am apt to idealize every one I come in contact
with, and my venerative principle places them upon a
pedestal so high that -few can reach it Then if they
fall from it by any act of meanness, I may forgive, but.
can rarely bow again. As the characters of many are
being opened before my gaze, my heart grows dis-
trustful, overthrowing this worship which I know
must meet its punishment, impressing upon my heart
such a powerful feeling of contempt, that'-I often fear
I am becoming very wicked, and that .its hateful ex-
pression must be left upon my face. Mourn that I

e house where we go daily is delightfully situ-
and very prettily surrounded with shrubbery
owners. It is also finely furnished, and singing
are making merry through the spacious halls.
Taylir, the mistress of the mansion, is a very
ant, benevolent lady, with two daughters. One
em i about my own age, the other a few years
er. Mrs. Taylor is very indulgent to 'us. She
will permit us to work until we are fairly rested

and the condescending manner which I see in
of the inmates, renders me unloveable and very
t toward them. Mr. T. offered to;take us home

cepted the invitation before I could give her a
e look, so I consented, in order not .to appear
gracious for his well-meant kindness.

family at noon, bu I could not help feeling a little
foolish pride, nor peep the choking tears down, as
they set my dinner before me upon a waiter. During
the afternoon I was rather unamiable ; an old lady, a
relative visiting there, who remained at home while
the company were riding out, after trying to converse
with me, asked m  if I did not wish to examine the
house, an invitatio  I had many times declined, for
Various reasons. She then opened the reception
room, with a mani est pride.
"There," said she, " is where they receive the
grand company."
"Don't they receive any but the rich there ?" asked
Carrie.
"No, indeed! not the poor folks."
There was ano her home thrust to swallow ; but
Carrie looked as thoiigh she had not heard it.
-' Is it not the sweetest room you ever saw ?" said
tshe, turning toward d me.
"No." I answered, "I have seen many I like as
well, but this is pretty."' I added, a moment after,
trying to soften  y answer.
We then inspected the grand parlor-bedroom, as
she called it, after ,which she opened the spacious
drawing-room.
" There, did you ever see anything half so beauti-
tiful as this ?" and she opened wide the blinds, for us
to take a full survey of the really beautiful carpet,
and the various curiosities worthy of attention, that
adorned the room. "Say, girls, did you ever see
anything like it. There are not many people who
have got such a fine place as we have I"1

Ella's in her own.
"Shocked almost beyond belief, the young girl
hastened to Mrs. H., who was coming through the,
hall, and had also unintentionally become a listener
to the disgraceful plot. She then told the young la.
dies to go to their respective rooms, She proceeded
to the schoolroom, and with the assistance of Ella'
friend, raised the poor girl from her lowly situation
She had fainted,. and. round her mouth was trickliiig
a dark stream of blood, which, gushed fearfully as
they moved her. She was carried t her apartment,
and a physician called, who said there was but little
hope. She lay senseless the entire night, the blood
continuing to flow at short intervals. As morning
advanced she opened her eyes, but was too weak to
speak or even move. Mrs. H. sent for her parents to
take her where she might be made more comfortable,

with the needful wants, and promising that she would

" Ella continued very low for a long time, but her
disorder, contrary to the expectation of all, took .a
more favorable turn. We who had been most inti-
mate with her, were favored with a seat by her side.
Could you have seen the look of high resignation
during her sickness, beaming over her face; could

glimpse of a spirit lit up with so much beauty and
truth, so mu h serenity and love.
" The night that a change was perceived,  innie
Wright, who was spending her Sabbath at hone, and
who is now  teacher in music and the languages, in
the seminar* where Ella attended, offered kindly to
accompany me in my watch, it bein  my turn. We
were seated by her bed, holding each a thin, trans-
parent hand, stroking occasionally her soft hair, when
very.suddenly she grasped our hands very tightly,
opening her eyes, whispering, 4 Raise me, raise me,
and call mo her, for I have but a short time to live.'
"We spoke to her physician, who was lying on a
couch in a room adjoining, and called her beloved
ones, as w eall thought, to receive the last fare-
well,
"She could say but little before she eho'ked so it
seemed quite impossible for her to I ve more than a
few minutes. We had all exchang d the farewell
kiss, and were watching anxiously for the parting
breath, as it became fainter and fainter, until it seemed
to stop entirely. As the grief-stricken parents
turned to leave the room, we motioned for the Doc-
tor to approach. He stepped to the bed-side, took.
her pulse, and, after holding it 'fo some time, he
whispered in my ear, 'she still breat es.'
"Then he grasped both hands, and wiith his eyes
bent earnestly upon her, he sat for t least an hour,
and we beside him. I shall never fi rget the expres-
sion of his face. It seemed to me 3if' his soul had
taken hold1 of hers, and held it. Never felt so in
my life before. It seemed as if he had commanded

her to stay, and that she must. He is a strong man
-strong both in body and mind-and moreover, he
is what every sensible man is not, kind and good. He
has been deeply touched by Ella's pitiful story, and is
a sincere admirer of her genius and her many virtues.
"I felt then, as he sat there looking at her so, that
he' was .doing battle with Death himself, and deter-
mined to save her. but what an hour was that.! It
seemed as if we almost strained our lives out to save
her's. But I think we did, save her. I say we, for as
we drew nearer together in the deep silence, where
our very breaths were audible, it seemed as if we all
understood and resolved to help each other.
" I was not surprised when at length the Doctor
looked up with a hopful smile, saying, 'Tell Mrs.
Clarke to compose herself for a little sleep. Ella will
live ! Her pulse beats stronger than it has done for
many days. She is now sleeping comfortably.)
"Ella lay in her quiet sleep the entire ight. When
she awoke, which was a little after daybreak, she
seemed quite bright, gazing around the room with ate
inquiring look. I put my fingers to my lip, motion-
ing her to silence, for the Doctor expressly forbade
any conversation. She continued to improve steadily
from that time. The Doctor did not encourage her
with any prospect of health, only by the strictest
care, and even then, he said, it would always be deli-
cate.

You know she stated to him she wished to have a
careful inspection by a competent judge. Well, do
you also remember her appealing to two or three
persons of literary attainments, for heir judgement
upon the self--same piece, craving pe mission to come
to them occasionally, asjhe wished " o assist her pa-
rents, who had many cares, and she had none to'
whom she could apply for aid. You must know it:
was a hard task for Ella, with her natural reserve,
and delicacy of feeling, to make su h proposals to'
people who were almost entire strangers; but, as she
told me in confidence, there was one thing which
rendered her strong to bear it, and that was the
hope, which should never fail her while she lived, of
being the means of assistance to her eloved parents,
who were well-wearied with their hard battles, and
well-stricken -in years. Ella had very little personal
acquaintance with those to whom -sh applied for ad-
vice, but she was hardly conscious of it, they were
brought so close to her by their beautiful writings.
Their elevated conversation,. their noble thoughts
gushing out so warmly for all humanity, in the shape'
of public lectures, kind words spo en of them by
friends, whose high-toned sentiments awoke in her
heart a corresponding warmth, all co spiring tp exalt:
and idealize them. Judging them  y her owh natu.

course, she sought their acquanintance ; for she had
not then learned that most usually a tranger has the

ries without the wish, or if the w sh, without the

ability to practice them; and that few are so regard-
less of self, and many are too distrustful of mankind,
to be willing to undertake a task of that nature, unless
a' previous interest has been excited, appealing to
their sympathies through personal acquaintance, or
judicious praise of a friend.
"Though disheartened by refusals which she had
reason to expect, and disappointed in not finding
mankind as she -had read them from her own blind
heart, she did not allow herself to be crushed. Some-
times I have thought it had made her stronger in the
performance of the duties devolving upon her,.more
determined to persevere through the obstacles imped-
ing her progress. A short time previous to Ella's
illness, her seat-mate received a visit from a friend,
distinguished, in the literary world, and introduced
him to Ella. After a short conversation on general
topics, he stated, that having heard she had a scrap-
book of original pieces, he had a great wish to exam-
ine it. He was. interested, he said, in the efforts of
the young, and would like to assist her. He had not
forgotten the timely aid rendered him when a youth,
and he was struggling with poverty and its attendant
evils. Would she not be willing, he said, for him to
take them to 'W-. He would, when he had leis.
ure, look them over, point out her: errors, and, if de-
sirabe, make- arrangements with a friend  of his, a
well-known editor, to publish them. Perhaps, he
said, it maay-lead to something more advantageous:.
" That was the, last she heard of her pieces until

promise th t.should she consent to forward others of
equal merit, they should receive the same reward.
Whenever she has had the strength s e has continued
to do so. She is now in a female ollege out West

of forgetti ig self.
"Poor Mary Hart! I have left her1 far behind-

Mary was publicly expelled from scool, as she stout.

affair, and boldly asserted that th 3 composition, for
which she received the prize, wa written by her-
self, thou h upon serious investigation, ample evil
dence was brought to prove the ontrary. JInvita-
tilons were sent out to parents and friends to be prese
ent, at wh ch time the stain on El a's character way
effectually removed, concluding with addresses from
several individuals; among them w s the literary per-
son who had befriended Ella, an   had read the
first. copy of her composition o  Discipline. He
spoke most feelingly of Ella, of her faithfulness to her
duties, he bright talents, her perseverence, and deli-
cate health, dwelling a long time upon the danger of
cultivating such wickedpropensitie3, endeavoring to
imprint upon the spirit of Mary Hart a feeling of sin-
cere sorrow. There was not a dry eye in the room,
with the one exception of Mary, who bore a bold

look of defiance, through the entire service. Mary
went from there to New York, to the house of a
friend, to drown in fashionable excitement, her deep
disgrace. It was not long before she- became a
thoroughly finished woman of the world, cold, heart.
less, and dissipated. She at last eloped with James
Arthur, much to the annoyance of her friends. For
awhile they went South, and she seemed happy in
pursuing follies, still keeping her late hours, sipping
her mint-juleps and' sherry-cobblers to perfection.
Not long since, young Arthur deserted'her, going no
one knew whither, and she returned a Wreck of
the once beautiful, to the home of her broken-hearted
parents.
"Not long since I was passing along the street'
where they reside, and seeing quite a crowd collect-
ing round the steps of their home, I stepped forward
to inquire the reason, when I learned that Mrs. Ar-
thur had fallen in a fit of delirium tremens. It was
a shocking sight to see her lying in such a state,
decked out with her silks and laces-dying such a
death !-and a woman,, too ! They tell me she gave
up entirely to the excitement of drink after her re-
turn. I am indebted to Winnie Wright for the gen-

CHAPTER X Y-
MY DEAR JOURNAL
How long I have neglected -you !  Many years
have passed since I opened your pages, aid traced
thoughts which burned on my brain, and which at
times almost seared my heart.  Many trials have
come to overshadow our young lives, and many bles-
sings have sweetened our oftlerwise bitter cup of ex-
istence. Through the clouds ave been many, and the
thorns have grown thick, sharp, and plenteous by the
dusty roadside, yet  there has been. enough of sun-
shine to enable me to find now and then a sweet rose,
to strengthen me with its beauty, though it might lie
sleeping beneath the thorns. Our lives have been so
chequered with heavy burdens, pnd overshadowed
with 14 hopes deferred," that I have not cared to record
thenm. I left you when I was just abuot entering a
new duty. It was ark unpromising season ofthe year
when I opened my school, most of the children hav-
ing left for country seats. As my mother was so
wearied with the additional charge my absence
caused, and my prospects for the time were so poor,
after two months' trial I abandoned it, to return to the
arduous, unvaried life, of a housekeeper. It was,
however, only for a few months. An excellent open-
ing unexpectedly presented itself; and as affairs at
home had put on a rather more promising aspect, I
entered at once upon my present situation, and have
never in the least regretted having dons so. It is a

'12                 VIOLET:
There" have been many changes in our family.
Willie, Annie, and Carrie, are all ma ried, happily, I
hope ; 'and I am  content to receiv the blessing,
though long delayed, that has fallen upon me, the-
completion, of, all my cherished desires.  Loving:
friends have come kindly to- my rescue. I found:
when I least expected them-when  y-soul was cry-.
ing aloud in my hours of distress, " , for a friend ".
They came and blest me. Seeking   e out through,
their own intuitive powers, they have been my coun-.
sellors and guides, encouraging me, and pointing the
way, where I may make myself permanently useful;
to my dearly-loved family. Through the unbounded
influence of Mrs. G-, I am now a s ocessfnl teach-
er, as Principal in one of our public schools.
My duties are arduous ; my cares are many; but.
my hope, and my reward, are sure. I am becoming.
strongly attached to my new vocation; and I flatter
myself I am much beloved by my pupils. The.little,
feet that come running toward me, as I enter the
shady street. leading to the school-house, the bright,
loving eyes, and eager faces, greeting me as I enter
the room, the readiness to comply with requests they*
scarcely can understand, the delicate offerings laid"
on my desk,. the many invitations received from, the,,
parents, and their hearty concurrence in my views.
and wishes, compensate for all my wearisome hours,;
imparting to me' a strength, a hope, a joy which I_;
cannot..express.

kind, affectionate parents, are now enjoying the tran
gquility of their own home, free from worldly cares and

anxieties. Their little ones are growing up around
them, crowned with virtue, truth, and all that is
excellent and good. They are all receiving excellent
educations; 'and two are intending to be teachers.
Soon will come my vacation, a rest of seven weeks;.
and then, after the lapse of many years, shall I re-:
visit the dear place of my birth; the sweet, sunny
scenes of my youth. I shall have ample time then to
look around, before the gathering of the sons and
daughters of Newport takes place, which will he the
last Tuesday in August. Our family will join me
there, so I shall have company enough on my return'
home.
Pet Isabel says: "Take me out to walk, Vio, after
you have done writing; please do'?" .And this
request I am forced to comply with, especially after.
her little rose-hud of a month has been pressed to
mine.  So I bid you, dear Journal! adieu, for the
present.  i
I am now in the steamboat iengjoying a lovely breeze,
and, to me, as sweet scenery as the eye -ever beheld.'
I am wending my way toward Newport, 1she dear
place of my birth. Is it possible I shall so soon see
my dear,. dear friends?  I can sca cely realize that
years have passed over my head sinbe I beheld them.
Little Isa, is bearing me company; and by her cheer-.
ful prattle and engaging ways, is ap arently beguiling.
the monotonous 'hours of many. o the passengers.
She is flitting around like a little fairy. One minute
she is ,sitting by my side, busily' ooking over the
boat-side, watching.the wide foaming wake, the great
wheels make as they roll in the water, and puzzling.

my brain, with her thousand-and-one questions,which
a philosopher could scarcely answer. At present she
is sitting in the lap of an elderly gentleman, whose
gold spectacles she has monopolized and mounted on
her own forehead, helping him to read the new,
occasionally spicing the silence with a faithful ac-
count of family affairs in general; and of sister Viov
in particular.  It is the first time she was ever in a-
steamboat, and the novelty of her position amuse
her exceedingly. For some time she has been sitting
opposite the' looking-glass, watching intently' th&amp;e'
various things reflected there. I had observed an'
unpleasant expression shadowing her sweet eyes,
when she turned around to me, saying:: "I do' n't like
those people in the next room; let's move our seatg
for they mock every thing' every body does out here"
A man just went to drink some water at the table',;
and another man in the other room- did just so. That'
woman out there moves every time you do ; and that
little girl, dressed just. like me, does' every thing I
do; and I do-n't like her one' bit.' I think she is very
wicked:; do n't y'ou,-Vio ?"
It was a long time before I could persuade her she.
was deceived by a looking-glass. In order to' be&amp;
convinced, she had to lay her hand upon it. After
that, for a long time, she has seemed to be enjoying
the mistake', as well as the' passengers, laughing
quietly to:-herself; as 'she watches the movements'
refiected° there..

" Those are cannons," said I. "Cannons, cannons!
I wonder what they are for?" muttered she. "O, see
that funny little man, walking close by the edge !
Won't he fall off, Yio, into the water ? Hark ! do n't
you hear music ?" and she clapped her hands with
delight, as the clear, sweet tones of a bugle echoed
over the water.
"Here we are close by the wharf. . Come Vio,
come ! .We shall be alone, and then we shall have to
stay out all night on the water, arid may be we shall
be drowned; then, what would father do for his lit:

Her question was unanswerable and she clung to
my dress and plead so piteously, I was forced to pass
my- way through the dense crowd; but after mush
pushing, and squeezing, and tugging, we reached the
wharf, where I found my friends waiting in fond. ex-
pectation.
I am now in the home of my childhood, or rather
my father's home, and a very welcome greeting have
I received.
"Is it here," said .little Isa; "where you told me
you got so many cakes, pies and kisses, from dear
father and dear mother?".
" Yes, darling, and. it makes me very sad to see
that seat in the corner vacant. TlIe great arm-chair
is now rarely ever disturbed. Tle -form that was
wont to fill it, where has it gone ?. Death has visited
our hearth-stone, and on his dusky wings borne our

"Don't you miss her," said Isa. "I wish I had a

"Miss her? Oh, the sad loss of her we loved,'
said I to myself, more than in answer, to her. How
ca  we speak of it?. Let us walk through these
open doors. It seems as though I must see her'
standing near her bureau, adjusting her cap, or tak-
ing out something nice from the tall cupboard,' to'
place in my liand. My heart gushes with all j my
childishness and yearning .love, and my arms almost
open to enfold her in my embrace. We miss her, we
say. Is there a word that can express our heavy
loss ?  She shed such a beautiful light upon her
home. All who enjoyed a seat in her family circle
felt her sweet influence over them. May we not hope
that she will bless with her holy presence the ever to
be remembered Union. God grant it; I feel it must
be so.
" Do you think, Vio," said Isa, who requested me
to read to her what I had been writing, "that grand-
mother comes down from Heaven such a distance,
to see us ? I should- think she would lose her way,
shouldn't you? Well, she wont. know me any how
will she? I wish I could see her just once, though.
When I shut my eyes on the pillow, I can see stars
and ever so many pretty things ; may be I could see
her if I'd only look longer. I mean to' be goo all
the time, so she'll come to see Me," she whispere , as
she seated herself in my lap, for me. to undress her._
When her 'night dress had been adjusted, she put
ber arms round my neck, saying, "Let me be our
baby to-night, and rock me just one little while. I-

After-saying "Qur Father," and "Now I lay mne,"
she then plead that I would tell her- some stories,
which I did,.-until she dropped-asleep.
Dear: little thing! how sweetly she looked: her
bed draped with moonlight; one impled hand: over

brilliant colored spread, of"" Job's troubles," which"
she had chosen to sleep under-" S I can have some-.

Long before. the light, when Ilay in a partial sleep
I heard her talking to herself about the dear grand-
mother, who she 4as told patched.the spread during
her sickness. " Grandma, did you: come down~ to see
your little Isa to-night ? If you did, why didn't you
wake me? Are y u little, just: like-me, now you've

the steps are more uncertain ; the grey hair is deep-

while the crown is as purely white as the mind of a

As I review it, what a tide of feeling does this dear
spot awaken ! The home of our sorrows and our
joys! It stirs, up a fountain that has 'not been dis-
turbed for a long time, and causes it to gush forth in
the perfect abandonment of grief-grief for the lost
home, the lost hopes, the lost joys, never restored to.

so heavily with sorrow, and that care and adversity,
have riveted their irdn bands around jhem, unmind-

wearing hard 'nes in the brow, and sinking, with a

is easily rubbe l off from our exterior, and 'oftimes,
from our' spirits, by the harsh encounter with the
world. Our fohd anticipations vanish, like the rain-

but bubbles, cast up by the rolling waves of time ;
we grasp them, and they disperse in air. We follow
their beckoning rainbows, only to find .ourse ves in
the wilds of despair. They lure us to a trackless

a strong will, as we enter the world-" a will to do-
a will to be-a vill to bear." We should strengthen
ourselves by co stant intercourse with Heaven, by a
generous culture of that beautiful faith which a large
charity brings, by shunning all that conflicts with o r
inward consciousness of right, and by receiving onl
that which. our own hearts can accept as good. W
cannot judge what will be good for one another , but
if we all live closely up to our inner light, unbiased
by creeds, made from the spirit of intolerance and
selfishness, we cannot go astray..

of a kind Father's hand over all, I am loth to believe
there is in reality a single infidel.
To my mind the Creator has spread such glorious
everlasting proofs, there cannot be a sincere doubt
er; and if there is one of those persons living on this
broad earth, then should our sympathies close around-i
him, for rest assured, not a more wretched person
lives, than he who thinks this world was made by
chance, and that when the friends he has most tender-
ly loved and cherished, pass from his sight, they are
lost forever. It is hard to conceive of that darkness
of soul that shuts out hope. Let us seek to shew
such unfortunates whose hopes go out in the eternal
shadows of the grave, that there is no death. Love and
pity the poor soul that cannot see the kind hand
stretching over the broad ocean, the wide-spreading
fields, the fragrant flowers,, and all that earth is
strewed, with, an d the numberless worlds lighting up
the vast heavens; nor read the imperishable 'truth
that shines alike in minds noble and ignoble, the im-
mortality of the soul! 0, I say, circle such a being
with your love, and try gradually to lead him to the
light, for such a one needs allyou can gather around
him.

CHAPTER XVI,

. I suppose, Dear Journal, before I tell you. of the
pleasant hours I enjoy in reviewing my native home,
you would like to have a slight description of New-
port and its surroundings, as it appeared to me from
my own stand-point of observation, this afternoon.
I shall commence inspecting the charmed beauties of
the place.
Newport is situated upon' the island of Rhode
Island. It was called Aquidnek by the Indians, sig-
nifying the "Isle of Peace," and 'on account of ithe
mildness of its climate, and the beauty of its scenery,
it was known by the early settlers as the ' Eden of
America."
The waters around are studded with little green
islands. NewTport is in the form of a semi-circle, and
is seated on a gentle declivity, gradually sloping
to the water's edge, where the Bay tenderly kisses
it with its sunny ripples on one side, while the Ocean
comes thundering against the rocky fortress on the
o ther. The distinguishing features of the scene are
not to be read from the bay, for almost all that can
be seen of the shore isa pile of dilapidated wharves
and buildings, whose weatlier-beaten visage indicates.
rough usage from the heavy hand of time.
The old, quiet, dull picture is now and then relieved
by a red-shirted sailor, half leaning upon a wood-pile,
or mounted upon a barrel, with his head resting Lon
the window sill. You will sometimes see companies
of them sitting in groups around the half-open doors

Men and boys may also be seen immersed ii water
knee high, searching for clams, or bending over their
slender shing rods, holding up in the silver sunlight

fore the observer. The whole scene is s pleasingly
combined, and so delicately shaded, that t e true lov-
er of the Beautiful never wearies with the varied
views that compose a picture, whose exceeding love-
liness cannot be excelled.
Newport is a place of great romantic beauty and
interest, rife with the traditions and ari tocracy of
the olden times.  Possessing a very heal hy climate,
it is at present a pleasing resort for strangers, where
many an invalid is being renewed in body and. mind;
where the fire returns to the eye, the ros -warmth to

her genial tide, through the combining influences of
the cool, bracing atmosphere, sea baths, fishing, rid-

the pleasant rambles in the sweet scenery of the
present, and the slumbering ruins of the past.;.

equipped for her walk; " Aunt Jenny says she has
been waiting between five and ten minutes for you."
We set off, Isa capering like a little dog., s de-

Touro, a wealthy Jew.

were prosperous, The town then was -in a highly

breathing out their lowly lives in this enchanting
scenery, and catching inspiration from this Heaven-
freighted island.
As we entered the building, Isa crept close to me
and endeavored to hide herself under cover.of my
mantle.
"0, I am afraid, ;io don't let us go in !" and her
voice sank, to a whisper. " Arn't you afraid the
' Mummy' will come out? I'll sit on the door-step,
while you go in. I like the sunshine 'better than
those old walls," she added, dropping quietly be-
hind.
As I gaze upon the Temple in its simple, quaint
grandeur, how can I picture the thoughts that come
crowding up so thickly before me, bringing sweet,
sunny memories of the past, in the local legends that
were given to me by old and revered friends, as they
were given to them by those who had gone before.

friends, with hushed breath and wildly throbbing
hearts, pressed on, urged by a' restless curiosity
for exploring, until we had searched every nook open
to view, for the "mummy " Isa spoke of, which was
said to be encased here. There, too, I have lingered
long at nightfall, to catch a glimpse of the ghosts
that were expected to flit through the galleries in the
hush of evening, to review thel4ecenes of their mor-
tality.
How many times I have tried to decipher the in-
scription on the. marble slab, and longed to raise it,
thinking that that carefully preserved remnant be-
longing once to the beauty and dignity of woman,
must find a home here. I would sit and think of the
life that was once bustling and moving there ; of the
warm hearts that were lightened of their load, by
the eloquent, earnest words, stirred up from the
depths of sincere conviction, relating to the " Messi-
ah " of the "Kingdom to come," listening, as we
listen now, to what appeared to them to be the re-
vealing of truth.
I ever enter this sanctuary with a feeling of rever-
ential awe, not unmingled with deep sadness, for the
Jews of the Bible times, come up powerfully before
me, while I gaze on the things that once bore the
stamp of life, with all its spiritual and passional emo-
tions. My whole soul is filled with devotional ten-
derness. The echo of our voices moves me, amid the
stirring, waving silence, like the sweet, sad murmur
of the sea-shell, that seems to be made real only by
what it has lost. But I must fling off the dust and
gloom that have gathered upon me, and emerge once

more into the open air, where the free sunlight'can
exhilarate the spirit, as well as refresh the form.
From the Synagogue we went to visit the Ceme-
tery. Isa looked pleased as we entered the gate, and
soon ound herself at home among the long grass
and butter cups, nestling .in among the graves, talk-
ing and singing to herself. I sit upon the marble
slab or lowly mounds of the earth-dead, and then do
I almost feel their shadowy presence around me, my
thoug ts so quickly follow their bidding, and for a
long ti e I feel as they have felt, and see. as they
have s en.
Afte leaving t e Cemetery, we called at Redwood
ibrar y, which was erected through the generosity
of Abr ham Redwodd, in 1747. Very few of the old
ooks 're now remaining, most of them having been
estroy d at the time of the war.
It is 'xceedingly refreshing after taking a stroll on
he hill, and the beach, to sit down quietly with one
f the many interesting volumes which grace the
helves of the library; or if too wearied to enjoy the
weet  occupation . one experiences quite as much
leasur in examining the works of art, or the many
uriositi s and antiquities which have; from time to
me, been gathered into the library.
From there we walked to Mill-street, where is
tuated, in 'n enclosure, the "Old' Stone Mill," or
ower.
It is a builng in a circular form, supported by
ght pdlars, prettily arched at the top, above which,

ance of a floor being laid there formerly.
" Is n't this a pretty building ?  Did you use to
play here, when you were a little girl, like me, Vio ?"
asked Isa.t
"Yes. I used to come here very often with my
companions, and play ',catch.' I was told it was
haunted, and if we could run around it a certain
number of times, the ' old man,' would certainly
appear to us. Being very anxious to test the truth,
of it, and besides having considerable curiosity to'
see him, gave me great desire to try the experiment."
"Diydhe ever catch you?" questioned Isa, with
her eyes staring in affright, while peeping into it
cautiously, as if she expected to see him hiding be-
hind one of the.pillars.
" No, for before we had completed running around
the number of times, my limbs refused to support
me ; so you see I lost the pleasure of being chased
by that celebrated individual."
This morning I fulfilled my pifomise of calling on
the young stranger who had given the flowers to Isa,
Afew days previous.
I found he had'not been too lavish in the praise
f sweet Leone Rosemeir,. for, if ever I saw an angel
personified on earth, it was she. I. think I never saw
a being endowed with such a pure, lofty expression,
plainly indicating that she had placed her heart in
the kind keeping of God and His angels. Even little
Isa, felt it; for she looked when she spoke to Leone,
as if she could kneel to her. Her mother, Mrs. Rose-
meir, wore a settled expression of sorrow on her face,

into every little child's face, interrupting

pleasure-seekers, I doubt not, or at least they looked
so. At length I spied her far above me on a bank,
seated on the grass beside a gentleman, chatting
gaily. Upon a nearer approach I perceived he was
her new friend of steamboat recollection. As I drew
near, he rose with the gallantry and agility of a much
younger person, and, spreading his handkerchief on a
piece of rock, he offered me the seat.
When in the steamboat, having his back partially
turned to me, I barely saw his features; but now,
when seated so closely, I had a fine opportunity to
observe the quick play of the pleasant thoughts on
his benevolent face. He smiled as he met my earnest
glance, and said:
"I have not missed witnessing this healthful, charm-
ing sport a single morning since my arrival here,
when the weather has been, fine. Very often I join
them, and I feel as bright and blithe as the youngest
here. Look there, just see the fathers and nurses
flinging their babies into the sea!' Hear the little
fellows cry. I don't believe- they'll die of consump-
tion, with such good stout lungs as they now have."
My elbow-friend looked upon Isa with an indulgent
smile, at her observations, then pointed out to us a
party of young ladies who were -enjoying their sports
finely.
See, those rogueish elves," he exclaimed, 11"have
got hold of their father now. The old fellow will
catch it this time. There. he goes, good, good, good.
Ha! ha! ha! how I wish I was in his place. They'd
get it ;" and he rubbed his hands with evident plea-
sure. " See those countless heads that are bowing

ning through the fields, the animated objects, and the
old wood-colored house, standing on the summit of
the hill. I well remember how we used to watch the
smoke pouring out from the chimney, ascending,
wreathing, and curling, higher and higher, until to
our gaze it seemed lost in heaven, with the splendid
sunset filling up the back-ground. There were birds
dipping their white wings in the foam, white as the
fleecy clouds above ; and the quiet town beneath our
feet completed the picture. And to these noble
sights, came fitting sounds, the trembling, the rolling,
the unceasing heave of the moaning sea. The whole
scene filled our hearts with so. much joy, so much
love, it is impossible to express it.
' Then. father would relate to us many stories of
the good old\times. Where we had seated ourselves
we could just discern the spot where our great-grand-
mother lived so comfortably in her new house,-previ-
ous to the breaking out of the war."
I entertained Isa with many stories, among which
was that of a ship that once rode gently over the
billows, darting in and out, through the threatening
rocks and dangerous breakers, unharmed, until at
length, with the lightness of a bird, it landed safely
on the glistening sand, unpiloted by a human behng.

peated, and the chills, would creep .up into my hair,,
until it seemed to stand out stiff and straight with'
terror.

repeated tale of the terrible gale that visited New-

On returning from our walk Isa plead earnestly to
call upon her friend Leone, a wish which I readily
gratified. We found. her very ill,-but still able to
converse with those around her. She seemed very
glad to see us, and on our leaving presented Isa with
a cage-bird, as a memento of love,
The next day. we received sad news of dear Leone,
who that night breathed' out her lovely, though sor-

the good angel who had long been waiting for her.
Never shall I forget the pure, the angelic smile,
lighting up the still features, as I viewed for the last
time the remains of her whom we so tenderly loved.
Her friends bore her away to the place of her
birth, to lay her in a sweet valley, which is watered
by a river and shaded by mountains. As Mrs.-

slight token, dictated from my heart, dedicated to-

S"Poor little birdie! you've lost your sweet mis.
tress now," murmured Isa sorrowfully, when, on re-
turning from the funeral, she stepped up to the cage
where the bird was doing his best to give her one of
his sweetest songs of welcome. "You could not love
her as I did, for I used to lay my head on her lap,
and she would talk, 0, so good ! You couldn't un-
derstand it; b)it I did. And she -would tell me all
about Heaven, and the dear Jesus, wlo, she said, had
taken her heart, and that she was going to live with
im all the -time.. I cried when they carried her
way, for they told me they would have to cover up
er dear face with the cold earth, and I cannot bear
o think of it. It is too bad! .isn't it, poor little or-
phan birdie? But her mother says she will some-'
imes come to see us, though we can't see her, and
he will watch over us, anal whisper in our ears how

he people get asleep; and we wont wake anybody,
ill we? But we will keep just as still as little mice,
and if you don't understand her when she says good
night, I will tell you what she means.'.
"0 dear.! I feel so bad," sighed she, throwing down
er bonnet and cape, and laying her little head on my.
boulder, as the tears were ,fast raining down her
plump cheeks, gemming with "the bright .drops her
long curls.

and around my eyes, hen'I could control myself no
longer, but burst  out right with merriment ; when
she very innocentlyasked: "Why, who woke you

She scarcely touched her breakfast, although there
was set before her scme of Aunt Jenny's tempting
johnny-cake, and delicious blackberies; but she kept
rising from the tabl to look out of the window,
watching for Mr. Seymour, Minniers husband, who
was expected to call for us.
"Come Vio, come ! here, is the marriage ! Hurry!
hurry !" said she, as the last look proved successful.
She was in such a state of excitement, I could
scarcely tie her bonnet; and bhf9r  was ready, she
was snugly seated in the carriage.
"Waiting for you, Vio,", said she, as I gage my
hand to Mr. Seymour.
We enjoyed our rid exceedingly, though it seem-

" Those are very foolish ideas for a woman to ad-
vocate, Miss Angell," said Mrs. Hay wood, on rising.
"It's my opinion you unsex yourself very materially,
by uttering them. St. Paul teaches us to be silent on
such subjects, and I answer you for ne, I am glad to
follow his advice. I don't see why  omen need in-
terest themselves in such matters; and, let me tell
you, that in my opinion, it is not ery lady-like, or
becoming in you, to speak in that crude, independent
way. Woman had better let such th ngs alone. Men
love to have us lean on them. The are much more

proud of us, and are willing to pay the price, if we
can keep ourselves looking delicate and richly
dressed. What do they think of a woman plainly
dressed, with coarse hands and red face, brought on
by her vulgar work? Place her in a drawing-room,
even when richly dressed, and what a figure she
makes ! Do ou think they will notice her? No, in-
deed! No more than would I or other refined wo-
men. What signifies her education, or her mind, to
them ? They can talk upon subjects that, are deep,
when they attend their Lyceums or Clubs; but when
they come among us women, they want and expect to
be amused. For my part, I want nothing better to
do, than to attend to their wishes ; and, as I don't
love work, and never mean to work, let the case be
what it may,. I think a little flattery will do no harm.
And in keeping them pleased with ourselves, they
will certainly be good-natured with us, and give us
all the fine things we want ; besides, they will be apt
to return the compliment; and that: is just what we
all like pretty well.!"
"I beg leave to differ from you," answered I, "I
think you lower man very much by giving him such
a miserably weak character. It is only one that is
greatly minus in the brain who entertains such views
of woman. Certainly, if it is so, I do not think we ar
very highly complimented."
"Well, we are getting into quite a lengthy argu.

A TRUE STORY.              21
from the present scene, I could not find it in my
heart to refuse her reasonable request, so after a
slight adjustment of dresses and seats, I related the
following little story:
OUR KITTS-
Our Kitty was very beautiful, and none could see
i.ir but to admire. The fur on her back was very
ieng, and of a glossy brown and black.  fer ears
and nose were tipped with white ; and to crown the
whole, she had a long ring-striped tail. ° We all
thought her the dearest and cunningest little thing
one ever saw. My playmates, and the friends visiting
my mother, were delighted with her.
We had a box prepared for her in a room opening
from our chamber, with a comfortable little bed and
soft pillow in it, though I suppose Poney never took
great pains to lay her h ad on the pillow, or tuck
herself very nicely under the bed-clothes. Very often
at night we were obliged to wrap her up snugly, to
protect her from the 'cdld; but she was such a rpst-
less little sprite, she would not stay long in one pbgi-
tion.
Kit was a very early riser. She would come to
our door just as soon as the first streak of light
peeped in through the blinds, and mew and scratch
for us to admit her. Then she would jump on our
beds; and. snuggle in the warmest conner possible,
until, the time arrived for us to rise. As soon as
she saw us making preparations to dress, she would
make all amends for her quiet by her sprightly, mis-
lhevous ways.
-'a19

Before we could put on our shoes and stockings,
she would begin to play with them, drawing out our
garters, which were of long bands of bright woollen
braid, and pulling with her teeth the strings out of
our shoes. In Kitty's room we had a barrel, where
mother kept rags. We children called them baby
rags, because we selected many a pretty piece of rib-
bon or lace, that had become useless to others, but
which found great value in our eyes, to dress our
very large family of doll-baby-boys and girls.
After Kitty had pulled out our strings, she would
frisk about for a little while, then watch her opportu-
nity to steal away with them, and put them in the
barrel. 'She would then come running back, and
jump up and down, to attract our attention. Some-
times we would feign'not to notice her, after which
she would walk around.and mew again, looking back
to us, to see if she was noticed; when she succeeded
in finding this out, she would purr and lick, ,our
hands, occasionally looking up into our faces; thenJ2
would say-" Poney, where are our things? You
.naughty girl ! Go and bring them to me right away."
She would then frisk her tail, and look while winking
her eyes very saucily, as though she was saying, "I
will do it again if I have a mind to," and go straight
to the barrel, pick up our strings and lay them down
at, ur feet. Very often, when we were tying them
,on, she would play with them constantly, and some-
'times would snatch at them again.
:Sometimes when we were sewing, she would snatch,
'at:ourthread and work, running away as fast as her
little legs could carry her, to hide it. When com-

manded to return it she would lay it again in, or
laps.
She entered: into our sports with as much zest as;
we did. If we were playing'" catch," she would runi
up and down the yard too, and if. she reached the'
fence-post first, she waited for us. When playing-
"hide," she would always join us. We would then:
say-" Now, K ity, you stand still 'till we hide.'' We.
would generally creep under the bed, or behind the-
door, somewhere so she could find us readily. When
we called, out "whoop !" Poney would run. and .find
us ; and when she found us, she would jump up likes
a little dog, mewing all the while.
We would often say,. "now Kitty, you hide.'r
When we thought she had.gotsettled, we would pre-
tend to look a long time for her, and when we found
her, vould scream and laugh right merrily, whilst she.
look ,d delighted.
When coming from school she would lie in wait for
us behind the door, and jump out so as to frighten
us. At times she would be on the stairs, and as we
passed by, suddenly leap over our heads, and often
alighted on our shoulders.. Then again, she would be:
under the stairs, where we kept our school clothes,
aid strive.to pull them away from us.
Nice times have we had with Poney, and .many a
little frolic- have our schoolmates had with her:.
Whenever we were invited to play with other chil--
dren, Kitty received an invitation,, too. If we swung;
she would mew to be taken up into the swing. . If we:
walked;.she joined. us; or if we had anything very-
good to eat, she also had her share.

ing-her question, we were looking out of the sitting-
room wiridow, Willie and I, talking and twisting the
button of .the cellar door, which was fastened against
the window ledge, seeing who could turn it the
quickest, without dropping the door. Brother took
hold of the button,. and, was turning it to the last,
number, when, unfortunately, Poney hearing our
voices, ran to the edge of the steps. Just then
brother unintentionally dropped the door, and it fell
upon dear little Kitty. We ran out frightened and
crying, and took her up, but found we could do noth'
ing to restore her to life.
" 0, my Kitty ! O, my poor Kitty !" exclaimed Car.
rie. "0,. mama, my dear kitty is dead I What shall
I do? I can't live without her,' cried she, most pas-
sionately,
"Poor Kitty! Never more shall we see her look
up into our face, thought we, with her pleased, rogue-
ish, smiling eyes. Never again shall we hear her
sweet purr and mew. We shall have  .o more frolics
with her, no one to lie in wait for us behind the door,
weary with our absence, and longing rfc our ret rn.''
We could not forgive ourselves- for killing by our
carelessness the dear household pet, whom we all
loved so fondly. How could we have been so heed-
less ? How much we should all miss her ! Oh, th
thought was too much to bear..

A TRUO STORY.              221-

When we found nothing could be done with t1er, we
held quite a long consultation as to, how we should
dispose of her. Brother proposed we should bury
her, as e would anything we loved, carefully and te:
dearly. He prepared a bow, and we girls put- little
Kitty's bed in it, and dressed her in a long white'
robe. While we were decking her for the grave we
could not help shedding a great many tears. We
could not bear to put .omt little: playmate away froin
sight. Could I have had my way: she- should' have
been stuffed, and put in a glass case inr the parlor,.
where I could have seen. her every day..
Brother dug her a grave ih the. corner of the- ga'r-
den, and prepared a pretty white stone.. It Was a.
very solemn scene to us child-en) and'will ever be re-
membered. Satmedy- was appointed for the funeral.
We had permission. to invite some of our young
friends to be present during the service. Brother-
Will was to officiate as chaplain.
At half-past two- we all ,assembled in the sitting--
room, where lay all that was left of our darling pet,
shrouded and coffined, upon a stand in the centre Of
the room. As we circled around her, Willie,. witha
all due solemnity, read an appropriate chapter in:the
Bible, and a hymn After singing was over; hethen
most feelingly addressed us, implored us to' take-wan
ing of Kitty's untimely fate, and  be' pure" and good
while here, so we might live happy' whenGod called
us to his home.
He dwelt long upon her rare qualities-her love of
fun and ir~ischief, her gentle and affectionate disposi..
tion, her uncommon, reasoningpowers;,and her soft,.

ent. It exceeded our warmest anticipations. The
hospitality received by us from the hands of our
brothers and sisters, can never be obliterated from
our memory. Many of the guests. arrived here the
night previous, and as they walked up from their na-
tive shore, their eyes were delightedly greeted with
the " Welcome Hom(," which was inscribed ire prom
inent letters, and looked out invitingly from every
convenien  place. The town was brilliantly illutni-
nated ; t e Ocean House presented a splendid ap-
pearance. The old Stone Mill, which was decorated
with Chinese lanterns, was beautiful as the magic
work .of old. The arches on Washington Square,
Thames street, the Mammoth Tent, and the triangle
fronting the Engine House, No. 3, presented as fine
a spectacle as one would wish to see. At the Stone
Mill were- stationed two bands, at quite a distance
apart, discoursing fine music. The sweet strains of
that well-remembered "Auld Lang Syne," and the
dearly-loved "Home, sweet Home," which will never
be forgotten, but which seem refreshing and sweet
as when first listened to, fell upon our attentive .ear ;
our hearts drank in with avidity, the enchanting
sounds; and when they melted away in the quiet air,
we felt ourselves almost too happy in having enjoyed
the blessed privilege.
The following day, after the Sons had registered
their names, of which'ther&amp; were said to he eleven
hundred, bearing their tickets of admission in their
hands, and blue badges on their breast and shoulder,
they assembled- on the Parade, where they formed a
noble procession, and at one o'clock, escorted by the

band and several societies, proceeded to the Tent,
which was beautifully decorated, with n and without.
There they were regaled with soul awakening mu-
sic, and heart-thrilling song of prose and poem.
spoken from the lips of the Newport born, who were
only too happy to breathe one more breath from the,
sweet meadow of their native air. Soul spoke to
soul, and heart-pages, whose clasps  ave long been
closed down from the eyes of the world, were opened
and revealed to the tender gaze of on another. The
poetry of the past, which has been emb4lmed beneath
their shut-lidded lives; came up to  heir senses as
fragrant and sweet as when first rever ntly laid there
by a soft and gentle hand. Outwa d change was.
plainly written upon the faces of those who had not
seen each other for years; but the festive occasion
which brought them together, very re dily freshened
them with the rose-tints of youth.
The evening passed off charmingly. There was a
slight degree of respectful, but unavoidable crowd-
ing; and many little things transpired to call a smile
from the most gloomy hearts.' The- entertainment
was most liberal; and, let it be said t the honor of
all present, the fete was not marred b the usual dis-
turbances which, accompany the gathering of such a
rarge concourse of people.

And their little feet were just as blue when they
would stop to look in at' the windows full of toys,

'explanation to his little brother. "It' only said for

Amelia, warmly.

the long, white stockings. On his feet were slippers,
of the same color, trimmed with fur, as were also his
mittens. I wish that all my little friends could have
been present.
On either side were two trees of pine, taller'than
the mantel shelf, each planted in a large tub, that
was, however, concealed from view b a variety of
fresh mosses, interspersed with shells. The branches:
were all covered with presents for th  young com-
pany-simple things-but they looked very beauti-
ful. There were apples in almost every variety, red,
white, and yellow, with nuts of all kinds, in clusters
or single,with a variety of packages, neatly enclosed
in paper, and suspended by the boughs. But what,
had the most, beautiful effect was a large number of
fetters in white envelopes. They were tied with gay
ribbons of different colors, and the white papers,
with their bright ends streaming over the deep-green
foliage, had. a beautiful effect. On the summit of
each tree was a branched candle, with the divisions
all lighted, and many little candles were hung over
the tree, throwing over that part of the scene a bril-
liant light, so that at first they did not see that the
room was dressed with evergreens. There were
arches over the doors and windows, and over the
platform there was one larger than the others, and
the children grew almost breathless as they read,. in
large letters made by evergreens, with the light shin-
ing clearly through-" THE CHRISTMAS TREAT."
"Oh, oh! isn't it beautiful 1" were the suppressed
murmurs throughout the room.

The curtain fell suddenly and unexpectedly, and
before even Isa could ask a. question, the poet, or
hero of the piece was, shut out from view. The buz-
zing and humming of small voices had begun again,
and already was reaching a high pitch of wonder and
excitement, when the rising of the curtain again
brought as profound a hush as before.
The figure that now appeared was the strongest
possible contrast to the previous speaker. From
head to 'foot it was draped in pure white muslin,
while a long veil of blonde, ethereal as mist, was
looped back from the side of the head with three
downy plumes, and then fell, with the lightness of
snow itself, over the fair neck and shoulders.
There was almost a shout of joyful recognition
among the children, as they saw, and welcomed with
audible murmurs of love and admiration, our favorite
Amelia. How fairy-like-how spirit-like, she ap-
peared, as she came glancing in, with steps almost as
li-ht and noiseless as the snow-flakes themselves.
She was touched with the sweet tribute to her
charms, and at first could not speak. But recovering
voice and confidence, with a most charming vivacity
of manner, she recited the
SONG OF THE SNOW.
Tripping lightly as they go
Sing the glad sprites of the snow.

But suddenly all was hush again, as the curtain
rose. This time it was Tommy. He entered confi-
dently, as he does everything, but not boldly. Rais-
ing his fur cap as he, advanced, he flourished in his
right hand a pair of new skates, with gay, red trim-
mings-one of the first fruits of the Christmas Tree,
and then, with untutored grace, and in right good
boyish spirit, he recited
