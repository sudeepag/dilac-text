Thinking   ! you might like to have it, I have -written it out just as I have heard it v from time to time, and you will find it jotted down on the enclosed sheets  ( of paper. ;I get the facts from' old Mr. and Mrs. Londer, Uncle Joe Hanckle, Aunt Mary Steners, and other old residents here, who can vouch  ? for the fac-.s, as they have known of the Parks family for manya long year.

"To-day happened what may prove to be the final, or at least next to   i he final scene in the history of th' Wild Parks Family.

'Tie fathber and mother seem to have been not only intelligent persons, but ,xceedingly well educated and refined; indeed our older citizens have assured us that they never came across a more learned man than the elder Parks. He is a man, too, iof fine, commanding presence, witl a splendid intellectual development. Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Syriac, he speaks : with the same facility as the modern languages. HiIs conversance with the - Bible and the most abstruse studies, such as Astronomy, Ethics, Higher Trigonometry, and so on, is absolutely astounding. Of the Bible he can repeat by heart whole chapters at a time. If you recite a verse, the old man will instantly tell you the chapter and number, without once making a m stake. Give him the most difficult problem in Euclid, and he will demonstrate it at once, with graceful'ease. And on a starry nijght'nothing delights him so much as to stand beside a stranger and point out, with unfaltering pro- cision and speed, each distant star or constellation, give their ancient heathen mythology, or their later and scientific names, and describe their peculiar influences in their respective universes. IFe is a firm disciple and student of the science of Astrology,-indeed, this is his hobby,-and ne will talk for hours and hours together about the conrol which the stars have over the destinies of human beings. The moment you utter a doubt, the old man fixes his piercing eyes upon you, and solemnly says:  "You believe in God, of course; you believe He does and creates all thir gs with some good object. He makes the wheat and corn grow for your sustenance in season. The summer he sends to you every year. He sends you the flowers again and again, and the song-birds again and again. He'sends you the sun every day, and the moon in her season. Now does  he do all this, and yet have no object in sending you the stars every njighlt? You do not mean to tell me-that you believe those distant shining xiorlds have no use? Ah, no! every creation of God has its definite usI and object, and every passirng year and fleetimg day teaches more and m6re of these objects and uses. And the time will come when every human being wil- know and appreciate the fact that his or her destiny, on this earth at least, is influenced by the stars in heaven. We do not understand it thoroughly .yet; but our knowledge is progressing; the day is surely coming." In his manner, old Parks is exceedingly courteous and gentlemanly. He will invite you into his wretched cabin in the woods, with all the pol- ished suavity of a merchant asking you intoh luxuriant parlor. yet to-day the son of this intellectual man was cast into the strongest eel. of our prison, to prevent him murdering his father, in the same hor- rib-e manner in which he had killed his sister. We saw the officers of the law, four powerful men they were too, p itting his soan-or rather this wild brute beast- into the cell; manaclei. and   THE STRANGE PARKS FAMLY.            5 ;  -ied and bound with ropes like a second Orson. This was the only son  ;j and child of that learned man;         i            , , The contrast between the two was positively frightful; for a nearer approach to, the Gorilla of Equatorial Af'lica thanm the frothing, maniacal Aii ' Bill I arks," we have never Iseen in the jumrnn shape Ite is'naturally aomewhilt tall; but the constant habit of stooping down on his hands and -  knees grubbing in the ground for beech-nuts and wild roots, on which he and lts sister used to subsist, has considerably cohtracted his iron-like L ':! rame/]                                . ;^ On thl fronts of his knees and also his hands, or paws, there are hard .. ,iJ callosities, or tough leather-like folds of skin; the same also on the back :' and lower part of his body; fo"r, when not pressed by hunger to search fbio ' Ood, both he and: his sister would squat-for hours together upon'the  groundi or on logs, exactly like monkeys or baboons, basking in the warm i sun. For it has always beeni the custom, or rather, we suppose, the, :- 1 necessity for them to go without a stitch of clothing upon their bodies.  A The officers who captured himn put shoes, pants and coat on hinm by  ;1 nlain force, that decency might not be offended as they brought him along. - And while he was securely bound, these were not interfered with by him. (: ,;; But the instant after being placed in the cell and the restraining thongs . were removed, Bill, in frantic rage and haste, bit and tore every shred : 1 flom h:s person, actually inflicting wounds -upon himself with both teeth '- ;ii and nails, in his insane desire to be naked. Throwing himself down upon the rags, he continued biting and teari:g at them; till he had reduced them to a heap of small bits. When tired' od" tIis amusemoent, he squatted himself down and glared out upon us exactly :S: i ike the gorilla. Da Chaillu describes. His eyes flashed fire, while his '- ; heavy jaws, flecked with foam, now and then snapped together with lorribly suggestive sound. His head is altogether of the idiotic, or rather - d baboon shape; the forehead so small and retreating as scarcely to be-a , forehead at all. His hair is stiff and wiry. Indeed his whole body, quite A: / I ikely from the constant exposure to the elements, is covered with closed , , . short, bristly. hair, giving him quite the appearance'of an Esau. We 01 never beheld in the shape of humanity a creature that so nearly approached; r :he lower animals as this crouching, horrible, naked man-fiend.   ':' "Poor Bill!" half groaned the father, "I do dislike to see him treated !I o30; but he would kill me, certain, before I had him back at the cabin ' twenty minutes. He knows no better, poor fellowl"  We left the scene with a sickening sensation at the heart, a deep sorrow . for the wretched captive, and, a mixture of contempt, anger and pity for .,: dis refined but eccentric father; whom we could not help thinking Was 'X  responsible not only for the son's condition, but also that of the equallyg ,4iX k rrmible sister, whop: Bill had. so brutally murdered in the forest. ,. ' : Naturally our thoughts then reverted to the wife of old Parks, the   B6 [      THE STRANGE PARKS FAMI:c mother of these two frightful monstrosities. What kind of a person could she have been?  We could note help makin$, inquiries about her. It seems sh6 was not only handsome, but equally as refined as her husband. Yet she had lived with him in his lonely forest cabin, from the time shb mar- ried him; that the two children, William and Malvina, were born there, and,.raised in the wild, neglected state we have recorded. But aS they become full-grown, and so vicious that they often attacked and beat not only the'father, but also the mother, the latter finally made up her mind to leave, and return to her people. Whatever has become of her ro one seeas to know. Some people hint that the wild son killed her also. Be that as it may, she has disappeared for several years and her relations, it, is said, have never heard anything of her fate. Altogether this is a most singular affair, and one which fully proves to what depths of degradation the human being may descend. MR. STENER'S STATEMENT., One day, about a year ago, having often and often heard such curious stori'es regarding the Wild Parks Family at Monroe, in this county, two relatives of mine who were stopping at my house, suggested that we should make up a hunting party, ostensibly to go after game, but really to see the "wild wood people," as the Parks were sometimes called. You see it would ,not have done to tell our objeot, as our women friends! would cer- tain'y have been tortured with great anxiety until our safe return. For there were the most preposterous, silly stories constantly circulated con- cerning the wild people; how they laid in wait for unwary travellers and slaughtered them  with huge cluibs, carried their bodies to their den, and there devoured them  at their leisure. The women had a special story about the daughter, Malvina, something like this:  S le was exceedingly beautiful, and that, set on by her father, who was a magician, she would go hide herself near some bridle-path in the forest, and there await the, appearance of any man who might chance to be travel- ling that way.  Suddenly showing herself, she would engage the strLngier in conversation, and win his confidence and admiration. This accom- plisl ed, she would entice the said unwary fellow to her cave, and there she and ;he father and brother would bind him securely and then torture him to death for some occult purpose of the old man's. OO course, we men knew that the women, after, dreaming these terrible  things, told them to us men as stern facts and horrible realities to scare us from going to the wild charmer's neighborhood, and thus courting a like dreadful fate. To be sure, there were several citizens of this town who had, in the course of their lives, been there, and had seen all the family, and they endeavored to destroy the romance of the matter by stating, that the old man and his wife were perfectly harmless btt eccentric people; that Bill, the son, was an idiot, running around the woods in a state of nudity, 9    i              ,                " . ' I  , '1,i TH  STRANGE PARKS FAMLY,            7   , summe and winter; that the sister, Malvina, lhad grown up In the same  ; way; and that though she was naturally quite a pretty girl, her wild habits had made her very repulsive,    - But 'hese matter-of-fact statements receivebd no encouragement from the . women who, with that tact so peculiar to the female nature, instantly con- t ;k\ jured up the explanation that this nymph of the forest could, on such occa-  sions as, it suited her, change her appearance from her own natural'loveliness .  to the hideousness of an old witch. From this we were left to the con- elusion' therefore,: that when: she was ugly she was not dangerous; but ' 7 that whern she looked most beautiful, then we must look out for her;and ' be careful not to follow her. Keeping our intentions to ourselves, therefore, we got ready, and the next morning started off on our adventure. On arriving in the region - ' of the wild people's cabin we-began our search; but were unsuccessful in  finding even the slightestl clue, or sign of the existence there of any hum1an being, though we looked most thoroughly.       -        ' Still, We were not disposed to give up easily, and therefore we camped :' down for the night when darkness came on, started a fire, and preparedi ;, our supper;. This over, we lit our pipes, and sat talking over such adven-.  -ures and subjects as camelinto our minds. So we passed thk time plea.-  santly enough till about ten o'clock, when we!got our blankets out and! - prepared to go to sleep. Two of us were to sleep two, hours, and, then eac Fi! : Nas to watch the same length of time. Not that there really was any..': necessity for the precaution of a watch, but we thought we would. keep up. : -he appearance of a hunter's camp.                   ;: I had the first watch, and as I was not in the least sleepy, I took from, my pocket a little book, called the History of Poor Lizzie Lee, the. New' J:i York Heiress, who married her father's coachman, and began reading it, . intending not to waken my companions till I should become tired; That; : book was the most interesting one I ever read, and I do not deny that my  Dyes get-dim with moisture as I perused the paragraphs describing the ' dying s3ene, where poor Lizzie begged her father to take care of her baby,. X: after sLe should be dead and gone.* Finishing the narrative, I stirred the fo are, pushed a fresh log on, and sat down in a musing frame of mind. ; How.?" ong I sat thus I do not know, but, all of a sudden, I was startled by some-:. ::! hins: making its way through the bushes close at hand. Bears, lions, catamoilnts, wild cats, and every other species of wild, beast flashed through f '  mly mind, and slipping my rifle across mny left arm, I hastily cockedit, and -  mnade ready to receive whatever creature might present itself.  x  ;.- Steacily, I peered in the direction of the sounds, which were evidently Hi coming nearer and nearer. While doing so, I reached out my foot andi v.-+ gave each of my companions a slight kick or so) to rouse them. As they: " :.; *Poor Lizzie Lee was published some time ago by, the old Franklin Publishini.: House. ;  68      THE BTRANGE PARKS FAMLY. - awo Ce I whispered- t Ust!" in as low a tone as possible, and held up my riglt hand to caution them not to speak, nor make any noise. thcy at once heard the stealthy, crackling noise in the bushes, and quickly but sile'ltly prepared for whatever might be at hand. C ur suspense was over in about a minute more', for then, thrusting their heads through the surrounding thicket, we behleld the two wild Parks Bill and his sister Malvina. In an instant we all sprang to our feet, aid in ano-her instant the intruders disappeared and ral away through the wood&, uttering the most piercing harsh cries, which, while they could not be said to rssemble human utterances, yet were not like those of any wild a inmal I ever heard.' It made the blood run cold to hear them; and as the fc:tr'- ful shrieks died away in the distance, we stood and (-zcd at each other for several moments in mutual wonder and astonishment.  "Why, they're regular screechers; aint they!" at length exclai med olle of' my companions, he being the first of us to recover his composure. "I wonder if we are a long or short distance from their cabin?" que- rie .          ,. "We might be, and then again we might not; it's hard, to tell," said the third. "At any--te," added I, "we will make another search to-morrow." "And let us stick at it till we find them," resolutely added my cousin; "for I am determined to know something positive about these queer folks. I wjuld not mnind wagering a good pile of money that there is some deep !. ronance or mystery about their origin.

My cousin was to take the next watch. I did not wake antil sunrise, xnd when I did wake, I found that our attentive guardsmuan had succumbed toi drowsiness 'and was enjoying a mnost profound slumber, snoring away at a great rate. His negligence made me feel a little itischievous. So, quietly -slipping his rifle away; I stooped down and hlallooed close to his ear: Quick!-the wild Parks! ' Quick!" With a yell he started up, and cut, an exceedingly ludicrous figure for aboit two minutes, in his half-awake, half-asleep condition, grasping round for his rifle, pulling out his pipe instead of his hunting-knife to defend hinself, and meanwh le calling on us alternately to save ourselves, and then not to leave him ,alone with the ferocious wild man. By the time he fouid out the joke I was nearly dead with laughter, while he was consider-: ably chagrined as well as agitated, to find what a careless fellow he hakd 'bee), in falling asleep while on guard. However, we satisfied ourselves with inflicting the punishment of making the delinquent cook breakfast for the party; after partakin of 'which we    - THE STRANGE PARKS, FAMLY,.          l again set off in search of, the Parks' cabin. For two hours we wandered about, at the end of which time, by the mierest accident,-cw disc vered the anxiously-sough i-for abode of the Wild People. Really, we had, on the day previous, passed within a stone's throw of it several times, without being aware of the fact. We should have been moro likely to find it, but for the reason that it had been described to us wrongly by a party who asserted that he had been to see the Parks; about whom also he Larrated a long rigmarole, without the slightest foundation in truth. And here, in passing, I would remark, that the great majority of the items and paragraphs that for years have been going the rounds of the news- papers are nothing more than the imaginative fancies of their writers, and, as is generally the case, what is therein narrated of the Wild Family is not half so startling or romantic as the plain truth itself. The cabin, or rather hovel, stood back a little distance from a' bit of clearing in the woods, completely hidden from sight to a casual observer; and ever if he had looked at it, it would not be likely to cause hinm to note , it, for thehighest part of it was not over nine or ten feet, and it sloped down to about six on the front wall. About midway in the wall was the door of Entrance and exit, while immediately beside that, to the right, was the only'window the wretched tenement possessed. The door was a curious piece of carpentering, being composed of straight, smooth branches of  - young ash or hickory, laid close together, and then interwoven across the  top, middle and bottom wi;h small twigs of the same, the whole forming a strong, I ght door, moderately weather-tight. The hinges were quite primi- :.} tive, being nothing more-than double loops of deers' sinews. A piece of :4: rock, weighing about fifteen pounds, performed the offices of both lock and ,. latch, being pushed, aside -from or behind the bottom of the door with the A: foot, as .,occasion might recuire. The window. was one ordinary sash of six 't broken panes of glass, which I suppose had been brought by the old man 1 Parks when he and his wife first left the pale of civilized society to come .  and live in the wilderness forest.                  ;" After standing some little time, and examining the exterior of the hovel, ? we advanced, and knocked upon the door. "Is that you, Bill, you infernal rascal? I'll whale you if you make me ,:: get up from my studies, or disturb me any more."'          ..- This exclamation, uttered in quite a rough tone, was the response our 1 ; summons brought forth.             .           ::!  With the second knock, I replied:               .:   "It's not Bill; but some gentlemen come to see you, Mr. Parks."  ' Ah I gentlemen to see Mr. Parks?  That sounds very strangely." ;' '-: uttered the same voice as 'efore, though in far different tones than when :  previously speaking. And the next minute the old man himself, kicking away the stone, pulled .1, open the door and stood before us, clothed in an exceedingly dirty, tattered .: ...   13         TMt STRANGE PAR IS fAILY. suit of clothes, yet, for all, appearing majestic and patriarchal. 'Ie is above tmedli an height, well shaped, though, from a constant habit of stooping over his books in study, his shoulders were somewhat bent. His face, somewhat long, is, grave, and generally benevolent., Yet, here and thcre is a hard line or two; that to the shrewd observer of physiognomy inddicltes a look of those softer, finer traits that make man admirable to his-felloVw-nI t. His forehead is high, broad and intellectual, while his head is 1aloc quite wells iaped. His hair is long, and quite white, as is also his beard, whchl being worn by him quite untrimmed, reaches quite to his waist, and gives him altogether that patriarchal appearance we first noticed. His mar ner and deportment are perfectly elegant. I never witnessed more case and grace and affability exhibited by the most refined man I ever knew tien Parks showed, as he invited us into his wretched hovel. ( Really, gentlemen-"Said he, with a bow and wave of, his hand," you do me a great'deal of honor-a great deal of honor. Walk in, walk in andcl b-e seated."  There was no furniture in the room excepting what hbad once been a trunk, a three-legged stool, and a log standing on end, something like a butchbr's block, min lis the feet. This log was worn smooth by apparently constant use in the capacity of a table. A small, rough closet in one corner, made of bark, contained a cup or two, a saucepan, and rusty looking tin cup.  tyhll an article as a fork, or spoon, or plate, was not to be seen- neither any kind of dress or clothing for man or woman. , The wretched abode was entirely clear, also, of any such thing as is usually seen ever! in the most poverty-stricken dwelling in the land. As for a bed, there was, none, excec t the term,llight be apt lied to a heap of matted straw, leaves and tatrs 1r;' w;s laid in another orner of the place. 1}I en I   ; (t{:tcred, the old man -.ls preparing his breakhfct, Which coni-  sisted of a -thing more thin four or five nubs of potatoes he was boiling in a littl old iron pot. This utensil was supported in its position on the fire by two stones, between which were the stioks of wood burning. Be-roe wp left we gave our singular host a box of matc'les. which was She only gift liD would accept, although we offered him other matters we had with us, and which we thought would be useful to hbm. And even the matches he would not have taken, but because, as he explained it, his son Bi 1, who was very wild and 'wicked, might sonietime, in one of his tantrLtuls, I;ick the fire out, and leave him alone in the cold winter. "Yol see," said he, though I am exceedingly hardy, still I cannot stand the weather like those two can. Why, during the most severe frosts, Bill ahd Malvina will run about through the woods all day, and not mind it at 11; though they like to lie up close to the fire all nig it.^ I By the by, Mr. Parks," said I, in response to this rer nark, " will you excuse pe for asking you$how i' is possible that you can al-ow them to go about it a nude condition!?"   THE STRANGE PARKS FAMLY.            3  "Oh, well" readily replied he, "they were born riglit here in the wild.  h7well," readily repl'-ed h,- lj rlrNr  erness. and we were so poor that we could not afford to get them clothes;  so that when what little tEey had wore out, wo let them run in that way, We did not mind it, as there was nobody in the woods to see them but our-  selves. You know, gentlemen, how ways and habits will grow upon people.  Gradually, Bill and Malvina got older and older, .and when we began to . Gradually, Bill and Ma       lifnr t ll'; : think about the matter seriously, they would not wear any clothing at all.  Il fact, they got completely beyond all control."  I How do you find food for them ?                 ; ' a Oh, dear, they never trouble me about-that point, for they find their  own food in the woods."!) "Then I suppose they catch fish and wild animals, and bring them home ,  for you to cook."  "Oh, no, you could not persuade either of them to eat cooked victuals. ' X They likie everything raw." ,  "My, my, how horrible!" exclaimed my companions, in one breath.  "Oh, no, gentlemen," rejoined old Parks, in quite a diied tone,." a ; such thin rs are mere matters of taste. Now, I have no doubt that you all  eat considerable quantities of meat-beef, mutton, poultriy, and so forth.  Yet such food would make me deadly sick. I eat nothing but cabbage, or ,' potatoes, or beans. I am a vegetarian in my diet.' Inever could study the {.,ta abstruse subjects I do, we e I a consumer ofVanimal food."  At this mloment we heard te h t sounds of two voices talking; or rather  uttering some sort of gibberish, of which we could not understand a single ,j syllable.                ,       -       X, The nest moment, just on the edge of the clearing, appeared,t the two  The next moment,.I1     .   i  wild beings Bill and MaLvina; the children of the man, who, in such a J polished manner, had mace us welcome to the cabin.          A We all stepped to the door to gaze at the creatures, who, witot a soli-  tary shred of clothing Upon their bodies, were half-creepig, halialking, Ad toward the hovel, pickingr up beech and other nuts and eating thiem. As :  I looked at them I was forcibly reminded of the account in the Bibleoft of the ancient heathen king, who was condemned to wander in the wilderness - so long, feeding, like the herds of cattle did, on herbs and grass. "Mr. Parks," said one of my companions, turning to our host, " it really true that that young man and that young woman are your- children"                   - "  "Yes, gentlemen;" .as the prompt reply; given without the slightest . apparent concern orshamne, but as a natural matter of fact.  sW ill you excuse us, Mr. Parks," remarked-myself, "for saying to you/  in candor, that the special object of our visit to you here is to seeithestK children of yours, and to hear whatever you may choose to 'tell us relating, to their and your own history.

"Oh, well, gentlemen," rejoined Parks, "I have no grea- objection to impart any information yoU may wish to have on the subject; though 't 'may occur to you that there are some matters connected with all family histpries, too sacred to bde dragged ruthlessly forward to satisfy mere idle curiosity."                          . . 4hougl not spoken in any tone but one of courteous suavity, yet there was such a quiet dignity and real reproof about this reply, as to caus3 me a feeling of deep regret for having said what I did; or at least for net having coiched it in less direct language. I at once excused myself, pro. testing my innocence of any intention to hurt his feelings or to pry into secret family affairs. I! . "Oh, no, gentlemen," said Parks, "praydo not offer any excuse, for I am quite certain you are not to be taxed with more than ordinary curi- osity, an i that, therefore, you. intended no insult to me. I could no- expect to be living il this way without attracting a good deal of attention from travellers. But I assure you that all you see results from a concate- nation o;' influences and circumstances, which, thougll they once migaht have been under my control, have long since ceased to be so." Just ft this juncture, the old man quickly caught'up a heavy cudge- that lay against his bench, and, jumping past us through the coorway, rar. across the clearing, towards Bill and Malvina. For the instant, we were quite staet:ed at this proceeding, but quickly saw what it meant; for, as we followed him with our eyes, we saw that the former had sudd lenly seized his sister by the hair, and was dragging her around at a territi rate over  ! the rough, jagged stones and brush. "You Billl you savage! you villain! let your sister alqnet Do you hear me?  I tell you to stop that; stop that, or I'll beat you ;o a jelly!" Thus shouted the old man, as he ran, and soon getting close to his two naked wild children, he belabored Bill,. th- aggressor, at every opportunity, with blows  so hot and heavy that they bounded like those an incensed teamster mght administer to a mule. Yet they had to be repeated several times ere Bill quitted his hold upon his sister, who rolled over, screaming, Dr rather howling, not at all like a human being, but exactly as some wild nondescript animal might have done. And more astonishing yet, in a moment more, as soon as-she found that she was no longer in t ie clutches of her brot ler Bill, she leaped to her feet like a flash, and began to caper around  her father in a most comical manner, while Bill ran off into the woods again and disappeared. Old Parks brought his daughter directly to the cabin where we men were, without apparently one particle of shame, or even hesitation, on account of her being so completely nude. She, herself, as soon as she    RR    THE STRANOG PARKS   .1 rLY .       17  .1 saw us, exhibited the utmost feari:terin, il trange, p;0illt ivC, te7rifled '  sort of cry. Her father spoke to-?;v9r in a kind of gibbersh, of whi h- we could understand but little; bit wich ' lhe certainly did, and thus succeeded in pacifying her, and inducing her tc come along with )lim. , n, Doubtless owing to her habit of squatting about, and guing on her hands :! and knees in search of the nuts and roots on which she and her wild  brother lived, Malvina did not walk erect at all; but she half'-waddled, half-sprang along, with her head and shoulders leaned forward consider-. 4 ably. Though of course she was not beautiful, still she was decidedly pretty, and it is almost certain that had she been reared from her child-  hood in civilized society, and had the ordinary advantages of such rearingo. ; " she would have been lovely. The complexion of her skin, in such spots. as were free from the dirt with which she was covered, was' very lair.  Her hair was long, and had it been cleaned and properly combed, it would? have been quite luxuriant, being in its natural color a chestnut brown and ' ofi a wavy nature. her eyes were really beautiful, being bright blue and i large. Long, drooling Ilashcs added 'to their beauty, thoughl when yout. scanned thiosc eyes closely, there was a vacancy rwhich plainly.'indicated a': something lacking in the mindl. Her eyes in conjunctiotn with the narrow ?? back-sloping forehead, told plainly enough that Malvina was idiotic. One thing I took' particular notice of was, that this wild girl, tliis nearly.. - 'imbecile child'of old Parks, possessed the most perfectly beautif{ul shape -  imaginable, with the exception, of course, of her hands and feet, wlich,:-  from her manner of life, were terribly misshapen; looking more like pawn ,: and hoofs than the extremities of a human bein.

"( Well, she became afraid of Bill. You see, for several years Bill has been getting wilder and fiercer.' At times he would fly at all of us. He beat his mother on two or three occasions, and twice he has att acked me." "Then don't you think it would be advisable for you to have him put under some restraint, so that he cannot do either you or his sister any harm?"        ; "Perhaps it might; but I know that if I once do so, he will be treated with exceeding harshness.

A repetition of the, sound, prolongled this time t.) a kind of dis- . mal howl, caused the idiot sister to manifest the utmost uneasiness.  She glanced first at her father, And then at us, crept into the corner, and then to the side farthest from where we stood, never ceasing, meanwhile, to     ; utter the most piteons, whiining ind of groan and indesoribable guttural ounds.          i   '   THN STRANaE PARRS FAMLY,          ta V "You see, gentlemen, what a control Bill has over Malvina- She wate "' to get to him again, though he has just beaten her so dreadfully."

"Just imagine us in the role of Barnum, with the Fejee Mermaid.",  Old Parks noticed the drift of these remarks, and seeing that he had L:X.: made a   mistake, he'in turn made haste to explain as follows: , "Gentlemen, do not think me discourteous; but when I heard you speak 'i of finding Bill and  alvina, Ithoug ' of my past experience.

And whlat was sth more horrible, 3ill and his sister destroyed theo child shortly aftr its bir h." A long s'lence followed th'ls frightful confession, for we were all comr- pletely stur ned by the exposure. At last I said:  "bMr. Parks, was it previous or subsequent to this event tha; your wife left?"           A "It was after it, about three weeks ." "This is very horrible, Mr. Parks," said my cousin, "and I should think you would be very anxious to have these poor, unfortunate children of yours placed somewhere. where they would receive proper, kir d and con- siderate treat mlent.'  i  "Lately I have thought seriously of the same thing, but I scarcely know how to go about it.

"Yes, yes, quite likely-q-uite likely," assented the old man, in a sighing kind of voice,                      - It was evident that he loved these two wild, idiot childrenl of his, that he did not wish to part witt them, and yet that he dreaded loager to allow them to be roaming the woods together.         i "If yol say so, Mr. Pavks," said I, after another lengthy pause, "we will interest ourselves in behalf of your son and daughter, to have them properly taken care of."

But Bill is a wild, fierce fellow, and he may kill her, and me, too, for that mat'er, for he is getting too strong for me." After zalking farther to the old man, to confirm him in hip rew and wise resolution, we took our leave of him, promising togo back at lla stipulated time.   THE STRANGE PARKS FAMLY.    , ANOTHER VISIT TO THE CAIBIN IN TIE1 WOODS. ; According to our promise, we went again to old Parks' cabin. W hi we entered the wretched ltovel, the only change-there was in the appea ance of thile place from the previous visit, was that the file was out, thoou the same old iron pot lay on its side, with the hollow place in the grout in which the faire was usually made. Old Parks was not there, accordin to lhis promise. Seating ourselves upon the log, which apparently, in pr vious years, had served the singular people as a table, we began to conver, about the object of this second visit.      *      ' "'This is a wild-goose- chase, you may depend," laughingly remarke my cousin.' "Maybe the old man has changed his mind," added the other.  "Well, let us wait and see how it will turn outJ," advised myself. ] certainly looks to me, like as though tie old man has been away the whol time since we were here last."    ,  ,' Wlho knows! Perhaps that wild fellow, Bill, has finished both: hii sister and the old man!".said the other one. Alter we had sat there a long time, we concluded to take our lunch. 8So drawing the edibles and our bottles from our pouches, we comimeneiied u meal in downright earnest, for our appetites were wonderfully sharpened by the long tramp through the forest. Throur h'with this, we set ourselves again to the task of passing away the time; for we resolved to wait until night before giving up the object ofto visit ... It was a strange, and I may say, quite a solemn watch.

'It would not require morel than one chap, though, like old Parks' son 1, to ma]ce things lively." $ This droll remark, by my 'cousin, destroyed all the poetry a d romance was trying to' weave round the subject, and set all three of us to the inost coarious laughter. So the rest of the time, till evening, ve spent in eking jokes and amusing ourselves. When ttle sun sank behind a fringe of light, fleecy clouds which had ne upon the horizon during the previous half-hour, we bega to talk of ing up Our errand, and returning home. That old Parks h id reconsid- d his priomise and was absenting himself purposely, so as to a oid meeting we all felt pretty well convinced. Because, argued we, if it were not he wou d have been here to see us, and tell us that he had failed to find wild son and daughter. pr if he knew he could not be at ils cabin on s day he had appointed:, he certainly could have written a vord or two, I left tie message on the bench, or stuck up somewhere thet we might it. There was but one or two contingencies that might arise to )revent this. might be led a great distance away from the cabin, and ;hereby pre- ited from returning on thb time he calculated. Or he migh:., as already s been suggested, have fallen a victim to the murderous pission of his i, Bill. Somehow or other this idea obtained the most favo with us. When night came, we concluded to stay until the next morning at any e; for we had, each of us, become so thoroughly in earnest w ith our mis- an, that we had resolved td see it through to some definite result, either  icessful or otherwise. Accordingly we disposed ourselves around the fire that we had lit, and Loked our pipes and talked away the time till about eleven o clock, when rolled ourselves up in our blankets and went to sleep. Before lying down, ,wever, \we took the precaution of fastening the rude door and window surely, s) that in case thq ferocious Bill should chance to come to the bin dur ng the night, he Would not find us unprepared and do us harm ile we , lept. All of s slumbered soundly and awoke, at daylight to find (urselves the e occuplants of the hovel. No one had been near all night;. At least, ien we vnrent outside to see if any one had knocked over the light railing twigs, which we had placed in front of the door and winlow for this press detective purpose, we found them there undisturbed. We no, gave up further-hope of having an interview with Parks, and tl d. ourselves to the task of eating a good, hearty breakfast before start- or lip e. We contented ourselves with giving the old man, what my U3a denominated a "Qual;er Blessing," instead of asking grace over our   - - THE STRANGO PARKS FAMLY.      '28 :,  breakfast, and during the meal we ignored the wild people altogether, nd Ad talked only about other subjects.             ;       Through with breakfast, we hastily packed our haversacks, shouldered X our rifles, and for all the world like three brigands. marched off through ; the forest in the direction of home.             ]  After a tramp of about two miles; during which we shot a few s bit  of game, my cousin suddenly crouched down and motioned to us to dp the : same and to keep silence. Of course, we instinctively obeyed, and thenou  he turned and said in a whisper:                   . i ".Wait a bit. There they go now toward the cabin, all three of them. ., P Let them go ahead and we can follow them at a distance."        i Listening intently, we could hear the tramping steps of the father and , i his son and daughter crackling among the crisp, dry leaves and snapping t branches with which the ground was covered. They were, walking at : quite a brisk pace, and waiting till the sounds had completely died away, ? we then cautiously raised up and glanced after them. But not until they ' were completely out of sight did we attempt to follow them. .    . tol-^rt, my cousin, as he had! had considerable experience in scouting- : -i having beeal . -nion of the famous Kit Carson in crossing the West- ,: ern 'lains-took the lead, while we, two kept back in his rear as far Uas A[, possible without losing sight of him.             :' At a middling rapid rate we traced our way back to the cabin, within., .'S;Y whose wretched walls we beheld the objects of our curiosity disappear.  We stopped, and slipping behind a deep thicket, held a consulttionas to, ^)l what would be the iost advisable Course of action now.

Yet" :i: g this was done in such an apparently accidental manner as, not to attra1! ;^^fIS" any attention.       I              , "( Ah, gentlemen," said old Parks, with calm suavity, as he saw us enters, .  "I am very glad, very glad indeed to see you.,             ; "We were here yesterday, Mr. Parks," rejoined I, " waiting for you, and ' :t: having staid until nightfall, and still you did not come, we concluded to,:. , i turn your cabin into a hotel de Gypsey. So we built a little fire and sleo :  as comfortably as though we had been ensconced in the sky-parlor at thei -/: Astor House."        I            .     '   .... Ah, yes, I was exceedingly sorry to. be obliged to disappoint you, gen- , ; tlemen," answered Parks, "but circumstances compelled it."    ' " "We began to fear that perhaps Bill there had done you some fatal ' violence."                ' I        '  "' On the contrary, gentlemen, he has been exceedingly docile. But the: r two of them had wandered a long distance away fromn here. I did not finda; l   THE STRANGE PARKS- FAMLY. them entil yesterday, when I at once started on my journey back; and I I ave j ist returned." i              l We explained to him that we had seen him go into the1 cabin and had fillowed on. After a little further exchange of remarks I opened the main chject of the visit by saying: '. "Well, Mr. Parks, what are your intentions now in regard to these two children of yours. You know what we proposed was ertilrely for their enefit, and not through any idle-desire upon out part to meddle with our private affairs." "Yes, gentlemen, I am satisfied upon that point. I [m convinced it would be better for their welfare and my own peace of mir d, to have them placed in some quiet asylum where they would be taken pro(per care of." "Do you rot think it would be the best course for you to pursue, to go with t em yourself and Stay by them-always? No one could understand, and t erefore no one cor trol them as well as you." "That would be impossible," quickly replied Parks. "I have lived here 'n this solitude for a quarter of a century. All these years I have spent 'n studying my favorite sciences. The habits I have ivan: ped myself into *n tha: lapse of time, would render me altogether unfit to- mix in ordinary :'.ociety. Were I possessed of wealth, this might pechaps make no differ- ence. But as I am entirely without means, I could not lnake my living, and I could never submit to being a pauper. Oh, no, gentlemen; here, on this little patch of ground I can raise enough of vegetables to suffice all my moderate wants, and so be perfectly independent of-my fellow-men. I know I am eccentric, and this peculiarity alone would render my life among civilized people anything but happy." "Well," remarked I, "the suggestion was made merely because we thoiughlt you nmight not like to be separated from yourlinlortunate chil- dren."                       I  "Many thanks for your kind consideration, gentlemen; but, as I very seldomi see them, and as: I know Bill is becomting dangerous, the intended separntion will be more Satisfactory to me than otherwise. I shall thereby be relieved of that dreadful anxiety which is daily growin9 more and more oppressive to my mlnd.'i 's "lo you think they will go along with us without trouble?"I asked, glaneiig at Bill and his sister as I spoke. Oh1, yes; they are in quite a docile humor, and I hardly think they will caange before we .et them to the asylum. When they see me going along, they will thinklnthin(g suspicious." "How soon will yot lBe ready to Start?"I inquired of the old man. "In about half an hour, or an hour perhaps. I must boil a few potatoes, ,or T shall not be competent for the journey. I have no; eaten anything since yesterday about noon."  On this remark, we at once. produced bread and coffeel from our haver- I/   'THE STRANGE PARKS FAMLY.          '25 sacks, and, in a short time, had/a tempting meal spread out on the log which stood Parks instead of a table. We also had meat, but he would.:- touch nothing except the bread and coffee. Parks having asbured us that there was no danger of Bill or Malviria attempting to leave the cabin, we had all tihree seated ourselves oh'the ground. As soon as the odor of the boiling coffee began to fill the cabin, Bill and his sister were evidently much affected by it, and edged over :i, toward us in a way that astonished their father, finally coming quite close,  and squatting just behind us, and uttering low-toned sounds which the old  man interpreted. "They want some of the coffee." 'Two tin-cups were filled' up, sweetened well with sugar, and given to : them. After sipping it, they drank it all off at a single draught. . This-was a great mistake on our part, and defeated the whole object of , our mission.     -                        ,: Shortly after the meal was finished, we hastily, repacked our haversacks, ready to start back, when all on a sudden, Bill became violently excited, as ' also did -Malvina. Never before having tasted coffee, their nervous systems ' were so unused to such stimulants, that the strong beverage acted upon them just as powerfully as alcohol would upon ordinary persons who had ^' never' tasted it.   Uttering wild and discordant cries both of them leaped up, and; in a moment more, had bounded through the doorway into the open  air. anid -' ere we could run out after them had gained the woods and disappeared' , , from sight. Yet we could still hear thea screeching forth their singular[. I ries.         -                      t " '. "Let us give chase! Maybe we can catch them!"I' exclaimed, at th' ":  same instant running-in the direction in which Bill and'his sister had di :i,' appeared.                            -  I am considered quite a swift runner, and I am sure that now I did my ;: very best to overtake the fugitives. But it was a vain -hope. for though'I - ; ran till perfectly exhausted, I never came near them; 'They were asfl8bt as deers. So, panting for breath, wringing wet with perspiration: and,  chagrined at my failure, I made my way back to my companions, wh'I'ad  run but a very short distance after me.             .

The wild family, after the first excitement of their discovery had died o it, were almost entirely forgotten, for no one scarcely i ever went fai enough out of the road to come anywhere near their squalid cabin in the mountain forest. But in the beginning of this year thre was another exciterr ent, when one molning old Parks, with his fiace ard head cut and swelled up, and presenting a frighltful appearance, came, into, town and begged of the police to arrest Bill and take him away to lomle asylum, as he was now living in daily dread of his life from his violene.. In order to obtain his son's arrest he was obliged to swear out a charge against him of assault with intent to kill. A warrant was ;thereupon issued, and three constables were detailed from this place to: make the arrest, or rather the capture, They went back with the old man for a guide, and in due time reached the squalid cabin. Upon entering it they discov- ered evidences of a desperate struggle, in the shape of patches of dried blood en the earthen floor and' log walls, mingled with tults of long white hair, here and there, which the son had pulled out of his father's head. But the wild son was nowhere to be seen, though the fatlher had assured t'iem tiat, after knocking Bill down with a-heavy hickory club, he had tied him securely with a hide rope. Neither the rope nor Bill were there. Doubtlaess, as soon as the son had recovered from the partial unconscious-. ness to which his father's cudgel had reduced him, and4 found hinseli bound, he had quickly succeeded .in freeing himself, an e then made his escape to the woods. After a short consultation with old Parks the officers con cluded to search for Bil by tracking him, as there had been a light fall of snow. In this they ware assisted by the father, and, after a search of several hours, they ,    -' l, :C  THE STRANGE PA-.KS FAM1 i.          27 traced the wild son to a cave in a rocky ravine about an vils off from the  cabin. Here was a dilemma. They could not see Bill, and the approaich to the  mouth of the cave was by a narrow footway, along which- ily one man  could walk at once. And to fall from this path was to pitch down into the; bed of the ravine, at least forty feet below, among hleaps of broken and" jagged rocks. Besides, a man acting on the defensive from the mouth of the cave, could, without much trouble, pitch any person over: thus makinmg it almost certain death to the officers to approach their intended prisoner'si stronghold. Another consultation was therefore heldand it was agreed to try a: : stratagem, as follows: The officers were to withdraw out of sight altogether, and, taking a course to the east, were to again approach and conceal them-j selves beside a large mass of rock that stood at the right of the path as it left the forest and entered the ravine. Then the father was to advance a short distance along the ledge and call the son. They supposed that the latter, as soon as he heard his father's voice, would rush out and pursue him, with the object of revenging himself for his recent defeat. In accordance with this plan, old Parks walked toward the cave as soon as the officers had taken their position by the rock, and called to lhis son. He shouted several times, and finally out sprang Bill, and, the instant 'he saw his father, he made toward him with the most ferocious .cries. The father quickly retreated; and, as the son ran past the hiding-place of the three officers, the latter bounded forward and closed with the object.' of their search. Being, as he was, entirely nude, the officers were at a great disadvantage in taking hold of him, his flesh being as hard as iron, and the development of his muscles being prominent and lumpy. But they were determined as well as brave men, and, though the wild young man bit and tore them at a fearful rate, they stuck to him. Yet, for all, he would certainly have escaped, if one of them had not seized him by the hair and clubbed him quite vigorously on the arms and head. This treatment tamed him for a short interval, during which the other two' adroitly passed manacles over his wrists, and cords round his legs'in such a way as to conquer him and render him helpless.            ' "Lord!" exclaimed one of them, wiping the blood and perspiration froln his face, "I would just as lief fight a grizzly bear as this wild chap. HeI must be a descendant of Orson we used to read about in our story-books when we were boys."   . "Pretty rough   customer I that's certain 1" said another, wiping his face. "' No more jobs like this for me!" said the third, puffing for breath, and ; feeling in his side where Bill had butted him with his head like a ram.  ; "'m  not taking any more of this, you may bet. I believe he's: broken - one of myn ribs."                  .    28        THE STRANGE PARKS FAMLY. Af'te resting themselves a little, the officers thoroughly secured Bill in such a manner that it would be impossible for him to break away, and then, wrapping an old blanket around him, removed the cords fromn his legs, and at once started back towards town. At first the father did not wish to return with them and enforce the  "' charge against his son. ', All I desire," said he, " is to have the poor fellow well taken care of, and at the same time be safe in my own hulmble cabir- from his attacks. God knows I would not have done this except I had been driven to it." He then approached his son fobr the purpose of biddir g him farewell, not that the wild fellow could appreciate his motive, but Le did so to satisfy his own paternal feelings. "'Good-bye, Bill, my boy. Good-bye, and God bless you. I hope to meet you again in heaven." The son merely glared at him in an idiotic manner, but made no other sign either of recognition or anger, as his father took hold of his hand. "O, that won't do, old man," exclaimed one of the officers. "You can't leave in that style. No, sir, you must go along with us and swear out the chagoe.'! Parks looked in astonishment for a moment or two, and theyl remarked: W Well, then, I suppose I must, but I dislike very much to do so." Thereupon the party, with Bill in their midst, took up their line of march for the town. For a little while the wild son was exceedingly wicked and obstinate, refusing to walk and snapping with his teeth at his captors whenever they came near enough to him. But after awhile, finding that his efforts were useless, be 'became quite tranquil and obedient, though morose and sullen. As they walked along, the curiosity of- the officers was deeply excited, and each of them in turn plied the old man with all sorts of questions con- cerning himself and his family. Some of these' queries he would not answer, and to others he replied with evasion, while the rest he answered fully and pleasantly. After the conversation had gone on for some time, one of the officers said': "Oh, by-the-by, old man, what has ever become of that wild daughter of yours? We have often heard of her. She is the girl you had going round with the show that time, when you had this Bill along too." "Ah! God help me, gentlemen," answered Parks, "poor Maivina was killed one day by Bill.' "What! murdered!" exclaimed all three officers in a-breath. "She was killed by Bill. I was always afraid it would happen. She would not bo. separated from him, and he used to fly into his tantrums for no cause at ai; and whenever he did, he was sure to vent his spleen upon tier. Malvina was always mild and gentle, except once in a great while.   THE STRANGE PARKS FAMLY.           29'  She was never the same girl after that exhibition tour. I little dreamed, when I agreed to that, that my poor girl would be made the victim of such a brute as the manager proved himself to be. "Unfortunately, I knew nothing about it till months afterward, when she became a mother, and she and Bill destroyed her infant child in the woods here, when it was but two or three hours old." "And 'now this wild beast of yours, this Bill, has killed-her, too!" blurtecd out one of the officers, during the silence which followed the father's nari'ative. "Yes, yes," groaned old Parks, "How did it happen?" "Right before my own eyes. Oh, it was too horrible. You noticed the cleared patch of ground round the cabin, did you not?" / "Yes, we did." { "Bill was in the cabin at the time, and'Malvina and I were in ,the middle of the patlch. She was looking at me cutting herbs. Getting tired, I let her have the old wooden-handled butcher knife I always used in the garden, and she went to digging with it, while I walked into the cabin to rest myself. As I entered, Bill went out, and idq half a minute more I heard Malvina  screech. Turning quickly round, I saw her lying on the ground and'Bill on the top of her with the knife, driving it into her like a demon.' I grasped nly club and ran over and beat him off. But Malvina was dead already, with at least a hundred frightful stabs and gashes in the breast, stomach and face. Bill ran off into .the woods and did not come back for nearly three months. I buried my 4ear girl in .the patch, and ever since that I have lived in daily dread of my life from Bill. Several times since then he has attacked me, and this last time hem has nearly killed me." All the officers were so horrified and disgusted with the old man's story that they hardly made any remarks to him during the rest of the journey. This was finished without farther incident, except-that, just before they entered the town, the offcers, by main force, dressed Bill in a pair offpants, * shirt and coat, in order not to offend public decency. Of course there was the greatest excitement in the place on their arrival. On putting the wild, man into the cell, and loosing him from his bonds, his frightful disposition manifested itself as previously described, stripping himself, and howling, and snapping his teeth like a perfect d'emon. His father, for vhom, however, no sympathy was man:fested by any of'-. the spect tors, was much affected by his son's fate, and when the cell door was locked, and he was ordered to go away, he wept like a child, and lin- gered round as lonr as possible.

' '     '       o       k  -V     LETTER FROM MR. STENNERS. TUIKHANNOCK, P., Feb. 10th, 1874. DEAR SIR: As thereeappears to- be some question as to the cause and time of the mysterious disappearance of the wife of old Parks from the cabin, I have been at some trouble to make inquiries concerning the matter, and from what I can learn the facts are about as follows: , It appears that Bill, the son, has been quite vicious in his disposition from the time he was fourteen years old, and has been steadily growing worse and worse. 'He often attacked his sister with clubs and stones, and the only reason be did not kill her before he did, was because she was fully as nimble as he was himself, and could elude him. His mother had time and again urged the father to go to town and get the authorities to take the young man away; but the father appears to have been too lazy or too careless to' do so. The result was that Bill one day nearly killed his unfortunate mother. This was too much for the loving, devoted, but broken-hearted wife, and in her just anger she took her baby, then only three months old, and bidding her husband adieu, started, as she said, to return home to her' friends in New York. What ever really became of her, cannot be found out. Her fate is a complete mystery, though people in this region have their own surmises about the matter. Respectfully yours, o E. SsTENNERS.  The nude girl bounded off like a deer' at the hunters' approach.
