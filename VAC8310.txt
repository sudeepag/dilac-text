CHAPTER     I.
THE PROPOSITION.
[~OTHER, has Ernest come ?" said Grace
Winthrop, as she came into the cool milk-
room, here, with housewifely pride, a quiet ma-
t on stood counting the bright rows of tin pans
which adorned the shelves.
"Ernest!" said her mother, as .if only a sound
fell on her occupied thoughts. "Twenty-four pans
of mil ; the weather is' getting so warm that I
must make cheese instead of butter this week.''
"Why, mother ! you seem to dare more for the
butter and cheese than you do for me. I have been
waiting for Ernest a long time. I thought it was
such a lovely evening he would take me to Julia
Thorn's."
" I haven't seen him, child, since he came in to
supper, I suppose he, is very'tired, and perhaps
gone to bed.. You are rather late. -Was n't grand-
ma as well as usual?"
Ye;ma'am; but; I thought father told Ernest
he must go to mill after supper. I waited to ride
home with him. Ukcle Henry .came with me to.

bed, wanted to see Julia a little while to-night
erhaps he has not. I've been too busy to
hi    You can surely find him if-you set a
it."
On went Grace through the great, old kitc
through the sitting-room beyond, and out into
porch.
This porch fwas a cool, inviting. place,
benches on each side of it. Its cover was a qu
gable roof, shiglding it from the broad sunli
and from the storm. Lilac bushes grown to tr
threw their Fragrance into it in May, and
double roses' 'udded, blossomed, and scattered t
fading leaves on its benches and floor in J
Just outside the gate, stood an i old elm tree
broad-spreadipg that its shadows fell over the w
front of the house and covered the little yard;
night it let the moonbeams through, reveal
Ernest, sitting without his' coat, on the stone s
of the porch, his elbows resting on his knees,
his face covered with his hands.
' Here you. are, naughty brother !" said Gr
coming close up to him. "Why did n't you

"Well, then, I've got a plan in my head.
not mean to tell you quite yet, but you are so
to see a way out of difficulties, that I might a

"Not to g~o away from home, Ernest."

his habits were different from the old ways at h
and all his 'nterests were different. Mother
she should like to see him once more, but she
posed she never should. 'No,' said father,

Ernest looked u  with a start. He had great

her judgment,-and all of his plans were spoilt by
this premature dis losure. But Grace was clear-

ence. of her children,i.as in a' good mood to listen
to a little "foolish tal," as she sometimes called
Grace's playful sallies. Ernest was a noble boy;

"Well, mother, Ernest thought this all out him-

very incomplete. I know you will think so when
you hear it."
" If you tell me, you will have to get to it pretty
soon, for it is bed-time now," said Mrs. Winthrop.
With another look at her brother, from which.
se .gathered neither encouragement nor discour-
agement Grace said: "Ernest and I want to go to
Boston, to visit Uncle Edward."
"Boston! child, do you know where that is,,or
what you are talking about ?" and good Mrs. Win-
throp fairly raised her hands in astonishment at the
wild proposition.
"I do, mother, and I really mean what I say. I
don't think it would be such a very wonderful
thing for Ernest and I to go to Boston. You
always say you think I am safe if he is with me.
I heard you tell father that we balanced each other
very nicely. Of course, I wouldn't think of your
trusting him alone," added she, looking archly at
her silent brother," but we, Ernest and Grace
Winthrop, could find' our way to Boston and back
again, and tell you-all wonderful stories' of our
adventures. Come, say '.yes,' please, mother."
"Why, don't you-know, mychild,. that if I should
say 'yes,' it would not help you ? You have neither
mo ey nor clothes. You do not even know the way,
and, if you did, you have no means of conveyance;
and, if you, had, do' you suppose I would consent to
two such children going off to find the way alone

Grace, it's time you were in bed, with
of waking up with something more rat
young head ; ' and Mrs. Winthrop ma
rise, which somewhat disturbed that
head, and brought a face so shapely
character dir ctly to her view, that sh

" Wait a  minute, mother. Promis

grandmother's this morning. Have grandfather
and grandmother taken it into their heads to go
traveling, and want you to go with them?"
"No, Annie! Ernest and I are going," and then,
as quickly as possible, she told the delightful plan
which by this time seemed to belong to her as
much as it did to her brother.
Mrs. Winthrop and Annie exchanged glances ;
they were accustomed to Grace's rapid conclu-

admit their correctness; but this one did \$eem

1Irs. Winthrop ended the evening's consultation
by saying, "It is too late to talk any longer, we
must all go to bed; this sitting up late in harvest
time will never answer."
"Good night, Ernest," said Grace, and leaning
over to him she whispered, "are you sorry I'm
going with you ?"
"Going with me ! Judging from your success -
to-night, I think I see us both going."
"Don't give up so. I believe we shall go. I

"No; I dbn't think it will make much difference
in the end ; but I thought you told me good night.
As mother says, 'it's time to go to bed.' "
"Good night, then." And as Ernest heard her
light Footsteps on the stairs,. he could not help
thinking she was a sister of who  any brother
might be proud.
"She is provoking sometimes but she does
carry her points even with our goo mother; 'and
I should no' wonder if in the end I found myself
with her on the way-to Uncle Edward's."
Two hours later the tall old clock, which had al-
ready measured off the years of'one generation,
strikes twelVe. The moon shines quietly through
the many-le tved elm, and throws shadows all over
the ancient roof. Quiet and refreshing sleep has
fallen over every inmate of) the ousehold ; it
touches us, too, dear reader, and we must wait for
another ch 4pter to tell all we kno  of the Win
throp family, into whose home we h ve come with

CHAPTER II
INTRODUCTION TO' THE FAMILY.
IXTE must first seek an introduction to the head
of the household, good Deacon Winthrop.
The evening our story' commenced he was too
tired to find any rest i the old  orch ; but to-
day he is taking his" nooning" in the oaken chair,
and while he dozes we can tell you that he is the
youngest of a family of six brot ers, all born in
this same old mansion. By the ommon routine
of human events, he has come t6 be his father's
successor at the homestead. The other brothers,
except one who died in early life, have wandered
away. and found homes and employment in new
places-all enterprising men. By careful industry
Henry, now Deacon     inthrop, has added his
brothers' portions to hi own until nearly all the
paternal acres are in h s possession. He is not a
man of many words, b t he is known to possess a
clear, consistent Crsincharacter..
The Bible "is to him tl e foundation of all knowl-
edge. No season is sq hurried that he does riot
find time to open its pates and gather at least one
precious morsel to swee en his daily toil. Elevated

in caring for her children; they were "the joy of
her heart," and "the light of her dwelling." Still
she was so oppressed with care and the many de-
mands on her time, that she did not often unbend
in playfulness, except with mirth-provoking Grace!
Annie, the eldest child, was now twenty. She
possessed all her mother's housewifely attributes.
She was a perfect home treasure, caring for her
brothers and sisters with almost maternal tender-
ness. ." And yet,."\ she would sometimes say to
Ernest, "I don't know how it is, father and mother
seem to have great confidence in me, but Grace
can accomplish more with them than I can."
Ernest was a fine specimen of a New England
youth fifty years ago-a son in; whom his parents
found rest. During the summer months he worked
on .the farm, and in the winter he attended school.
His face was noble and ianly, and his form finely'
developed; his words were much more abundant
than his father's. A stranger would have thought
him more accessible. As we have learned from his
conversation with Grace, he was not fully content
in his present mode of life, and was far from being
a fixture in it. He' had made up his mind to teach
school the coming winter, and before that time to
get a sight of the world beyond Eagle Mountain.
Grace! I hardly know how to present her, s e
was so like and so unlike the rest ofthe hoseholi.
Her face was very fair, and her violet eyed pal d
and darkened with her different emotions. She
was full of vivacity, kindling and sparkling in the
life about her; ever respectful to her father and-
mother, but encountering. their opinions with 'a

monized finely and balanced well. His advice
often modified her schemes, and her disregard for
petty annoyances helped him cheerfully over many
difficulties. Life at Deacon Winthrop's involved
great economy .and care. The sheep contributed
their share of food and raiment, the cows yielded
stores of milk, butter and cheese.
It was, as Grace had said, a busy. household;
but it was the abode of cheerfulness and refine-
ment-a refinement which being inborn, a native
element of the, soul, developed itself as clearly as
if its revelation were made through the medium
of more costly surroundings.
Now the ever watchful old clock strikes the
early morning hour, and all through the east rosy
tintings outskirt the dawning of another glorious
summer day, and rouse the different members of
'the refreshed household to their allotted tasks.
Grace's first thought was of that wonderful journey
in October, and how it was. to be accomplished.
"I'll begin on the flax," thought she. " Mother
expects to tell me about it, and wonder why I do
not keep at it just as Annie would. She will be
surprised if I get it done before bleaching -time
next spring. Now, I will try and. let her see how
well I can do a thing if I really set about it. ±.I'll
make my fingers fly and the wheel,'too."'
Annie, who was an early riser, had.not yet gone
down; so Grace b unded out, of bed, and, quickly
dressing herself, w nt up to the garret to recon-
noitre.
Close by the chimneystood the wheel, with its
empty distaff; there lay the bundle of flax, and

heard the call

to breakfast. She' had fully intended to be ready
for her share of the \morning work down-stairs,
but the time had gone faster than she thought, and
here she was late at breakfast.
" Idid not' knew but you had gone to Boston,"
said Ernest, in a quiet undertone, as she took her
seat beside him at the table.
An appreciating smile was all the return she had
time to make when her mother said: "I doubt if
it is a good plan for you to sit up so late at night
planning to go off visiting. I wondered why you
did not come to set the table and help about break-
fast."
"She got up before I did," said Annie. "I'm
sure I don't knox;i what she could have been do-
ing."
Grace wanted to excuse herself very much, but
that would be spoiling it all; so she said, with her
usual vivacity, " I'll make it all up to-day, mother;
and to - morrow morning I'll get breakfast before
the cock crows if you want me to."
"Take care," said Deacon Winthrop, smilingly.
"Mother believes in more moderation than that.
An early breakfast now and then would never suit
her. She likes things in an even way."
" That is Annie" thought Grace. "I wonder,
if I shall ever get 4n the 'even way.'"
Breakfast and prayers were over, and the busy
household went to their daily tasks. Only Arthur
and .Mary went to school durin' these harvest
days; the others were large enough to be very
serviceable to their father and b other. Arthur
and Mary had their tasks, too, for they fed the

chickens and the ducks, the turkeys and the gos-
lings ; they gathered the eggs, and saved many a
step for the weary 'feet of their mother. Grace
superintended their simple toilette, filled their
lunch-basket for school, and then went hither and
thither doing nameless necessary things. Mrs.
Winthrop proceeded with her cheese -making,
which was, indeed, a wonderful process.  She,
managed it so nicely that it did not really seem a
great deal of trouble. She had a way of doing
things quietly, and as the snow- white curd was
separated from the watery portions .of the. milk,
she packed it into a strong cloth, inclosed it in a
hoop to give it shape, and put it under a heavy
weight to press, and was glad so.much of the day's
work was done.
Annie, meantime, was busy preparing the sub-
stantial ginger -bread for the field lunch. In har-
vest days extra food was necessary. Cake and
cheese, and a most excellent root-beer, which Mrs.
Winthrop knew just how to ,compound, formed a
substantial repast between the early breakfast and
the dinner. Charles came for the basket, which
was always in readiness to be sent into the field by
half-past ten, and then came the preparations for
dinner, followed by that peculiar stillness which
foretells the coming noon in the country.
"1What is Grace doing up-stairs ?" said Mrs.
Winthrop.   "I want her to go over to Aunt
Nannie's for some sassafras root for the beer. I
see the last I made is almost one."-

bleach it too. Aunt Nannie kept a-good look-out
for "bleaching time." She knew just when the
sun would do such work most effectually. The
busy hum of their wheel might be heard. many
hours of the winter's day, as they drew out and
twisted into threads the wool and the flax. Then,

Charles and Henry made it, but she kept it in or-
der. She had "alley beds," where the pinks and
sweet Williams, the poppies and red and white
hollyhocks grew in profusion. There were daffo-
dills and ladies'- slippers, and such a wealth of
roses ! Aunt Lois loved flowers as she did the sun-
shine, and they always seemed to grow wherever
she put them. AuntLois and flowers were always
associated in Grace's mind, and from her she had
learned many things about them. From her earliest
childhood she never went in summer time, even on
a hasty errand, that Aunt Lois did not find time to
give her a "posy just to smell of," and then to go
with her after wild flowers! It was astonishing what
treasures she found hidden under dry leaves in
early spring, so delicate that the wind would almost
blow them away. Grace always accompanied her
on these occasions. They were perpetual sources
of pleasure to .her. Sometimes, in autumn days,
she would come home wreathed in clematis, and
wearing necklace and bracelets of spice-woo'dber-
ries. Aunt Lois never thought these devices were
Tfolish; she had an eye for the beautiful, and some-
times she would tell Nannie that '"it beat all how
that child would- rig- up in flowers, and look as
handsome as a picture."

Then came the hour of rest, on the old porch, or

on. Mrs. Winthrop and the girls usually had more

Bible, with notes. A few high-backec chairs were
ranged round the room, and before t e front win-
dow was an armed-chair. The chief rnament was
the open fireplace, in which stood a ja always filled
in summer-time with sprays of feathery asparagus,
enlivened by the different flowers, in their season.
It was Grace's especial delight to make this fire-
place very blooming every Saturday afternoon, for
after the early Sunday supper the w ndows were'
opened, and all the family gathered  ere to read
from the sacred pages of that holy bo k which was
so surely preparing them for life's conflicts, and
giving them power to triumph over t em.
The hymn and prayer that follow d were like
invisible cords drawing these young hearts up to
their covenant God. The ""spare-roo "witnessed
the family meetings on Thanksgiving-days, and
was used when invited friends came t partake of
'their hospitalities. The children remeibered-when
one of their number, a dear little sister, had lain
with closed eyes and folded hands under the mir-
ror between the windows, and bee  borne from
thence to rest under the green sod by the valley
church! We will not enter this quiet, darkened
room to-day, but come into the porch where Mrs.
Winthrop is sitting. Her simple afternoon toilette
is made, and her mending-basket is beside her.
Annie is here, too, with busy fingers remodeling

"Grace must help rpe mend, this afternoon," said
Mrs. Winthrop.. "What do you suppose she is.'do
ing, Annie ?"
"Coming to help you, mother," said Grace; en!
tearing that moment and holding out her finished
task for her mother's inspection.
" Really.!" said Mrs. Winthrop,-as she passed her
fingers over the smooth brown threads, "this is
very neatly done, and I am pleased with your per-
severance. I knew you were able to accomplish.
any thing that could be done in a hurry, but I did
not believe you would get up an hour earlier thar
usual for six weeks, and actually finish the flax."
"Annie, you are too bad ! Did you tell mother
about my getti g up?"
"No; Annie has never said a word to me about
it; but do you oppose I have no thought for what
is going on up- tairs? I know when my children
try to do well."
Mrs. Winthrop laic the skeins on the bench beJ

for such article as needed her fingers most. There
'was -a quiet snile on Annie's face, for she knew
that Grace had pome to the point where the never-

They sat q quietly sewing, when Grace said,

planned and planned until we, know the way ; just
where we are going to stop at night; what we are
going to do when we get there; an   all about
uncle and aunt and Cousin Laura." And Grace
fairly caught her breath in her eagerness to show
how every difficulty was removed.
" I anx afraid you have forgotten th  money to
pay the way,(and the clothes to wear when you
get there ; btt how did you make so sure of the
way ?"
"Ernest has inquired of Edward Nelson's uncle ;
he has been there two or three times. If we only
had a carriage, we should be almost re dy to start.
Ernest says 'Fearnaught' is handsom  enough to
drive anywhere; but the wagon w uld not be
comfortable for such a journey, besi es it might
not look very nicely driving up to Un le Edward's
door."
Grace paused, feeling that she had g ined an im-
portant point; her mother actually 1 stened ; and
she had at least an opportunity tq d sclose plans
which she and Ernest had come to thi k very com-
plete. She knew where it was possi le to obtain
the very carriage they wanted. A  riend of her
mother's, a widow lady, owned a neat wo-wheeled
gig-a great rarity in those days, a there were
only three in the whole town. She t ought if her
father should ask for this for a couple of weeks, it
was possible he might get it. Ernest as not quite
so sanguine ; he called it a good sug estion-just
the thing. Grace had drawn such  lowing pic-

tures of their ride, and the delightful, wonderful
visit they were going to have, that he had come to
regard her as quite a necessary part of it.
"I should like to hear of the road you would
take and where you stop over-night," said Mrs.
Winthrop, quietly.
Now was Grace's opportunity. Down went her
work, and her violet eyes grew intense in their ex-
pression.
Ernest says we must be about three days and a
half going. We can have an early dinner and go
as far as Dover the first. day. I know Cousin
George and his wife will be glad to see us, for
when they used, to come here and we were only
little children, they asked us to make them a
visit whenever you would let us come. I remem-
ber Cousin Sarah was very'pleasant; don't you,
Annie?"
"Yes," said. Aiinie. "I went there -once with
father and mother when I was quite srdall. But
what would you do after you had stayed there one
night ?
"A bout fifty miles from Dover," continued
Grac , with the air of one who had learned her les-
son p rfectly, "father's Uncle Josiah lives."
Here Mrs. Winthrop smiled, and Annie remark-
ed, "Relations are very convenient when they live
on the way. Uncle Josiah would not know you,
and perhaps after your long ride, he would not
take you in.
"'Yes he would; we could soon convince him
that we came from-the old homestead. Wasn't he
.born here, mother?"

had discussed it pretty freely. Mrs. Winthrop had
heard the low mnurmurs of the wheel every morn-
ing. She had noticed the many confidential inter-
views between er son and daughter as they sat oi
the porch in th twilight ; and understanding them
so well, she expected to hear more about their in-
tended visit. To her astonishment, Deacon Win-
throp had listened with a good deal of interest to
S     her statement of Grace's sudden announcement.
He did not see how the journey could be perform-
ed, but recollections of his boyhood clustered
-thickly about him. He thought of himself and Ed-
ward as boys on this same farm, doing the many
errands that came into their daily life, enjoying
many pleasures and sharing many privations. Then
the long years of their separation, unintentional on
either side, might be bridged by consenting to this
visit ; perhaps he should behold his brother's face
once more at the old homestead. The more he
thought of it the more he inclined not.only to give
his consent, but to aid their going.
Mrs. Winthrop raised-many objections.. She had
never been much of a travele , and she did not see
how "these children" could go so far from home
alone. Her husand's judgment was a very safe
starting point, a id from it she gradually came to
think that if Grace could make he way reasonably
plain, she would not oppose their going. This is
why fshe listened with so much real interest to the
plan of the proposed journey. She had-talked it
over with Annie, who thought it a great under-
taking, but if they were disposed to go, and father
did not object, it was best to help them off. -To

Grace's delight, her mother made no great objec-
tions. She only said, " I can't promise, but you
may ask your father, and if he thinks that Ernest
can take good care of you and find the way there,
perhaps I shall give my consent ;-tak care ! t ke
care.! there goes the mending basket.
Sure enough, it had gone over, and all its con-
tents weresan the floor. Grace could not sit still
and hear so much of an assent from her mother,
and the basket did not know enough to hold fast
to the bench on which it stood, when in her joyful
uprising she bounded against it. So down it came,
and our young lady had to restore order, but she,
made such slow progress that Mrs.  inthrop sent
her to get supper, which her father wanted earlier
than usual.
It came about soon after supper  eacon Win-
throp.had gone out into the porch o rest in the
oaken chair. Grace had waited for his opportu-
nity ; so she sat down on the bench beside him and
told him how much she and Ernest anted to go
to Boston, and how they had planned to go, if
he would only give his consent. 1e heard her
through, and then came the usual question, "What
does your mother say ?"
"She told me to ask you."
"Well, if she is willing and you w11 promise to
do me credit with Uncle Edward, I wil1 let you go."
Deacon Winthrop smiled at the bright face which
for a moment was turned in its unspeakable pleas-
ure towards him. He fully believed he would do
him credit anywhere, and then he heard the clear
ringing voice saying,-

"Mother! mother ! father says we may to.
Where is Annie ?"
" What ails Grace ?".said Arthur. "She nearly
i    pushed me into this pail of milk ;" but Grace had
gone, and her light step might have been heard
around the corner of the barn, where Ernest was
unharnessing the horse.
"Ernest ! Ernest !" said' she,. "we are going to
Boston !-father and mother both say so
"Really, Grace !-does mother say so ?".
"-I had a 'talk with her this afternoon and she
told me to ask father. I asked him just now and
he gave his consent, and we are really going," said
she, dancing along and clasping his neck in the
outgoings of her joy.
"Wait until I put Fearnaught into pasture, and
then come and sit in the wagon and tell mne how
you brought it all about."
The wagon was rolled under its customary cover,
and then, away from all the family, Grace related
to her equally interested brother, the story of her
triumph. "Now, I am sure, you are glad I invited
myself to go v ith you," said she, as they walked
slowly into th house.
"Of course I am," said Ernest, " but who would
have thought father and mother would consent!
Your are 'a clever sort of girl, and I don't know
but your' way of going right at a thing will accom
plish the most in the end."
After a due amount of talking, it was settled that
our young friends should leave home the first day
of October. Mrs. Winthrop had many misgivings,
but her husband was so cheerful about it~ that she

tive ease and self-possession would distinguish her
anywhere, even if her dress was plain. She had
such a natural love for the beautiful, that she could
iot help adapting herself to it whenever she found
it. She had been trained in a household where
the texture  and shape of the outer garment did not
comprise the highest aspirations of the soul. So
she had a joy independent of them.
Leave we now the preparations,  nd hasten on
with the days until they usher in the first day of
October.
It is plain the glorious morning heralds some. un-
u sual event at the Winthrop mansion. Aunt Nan-

fast dishes, both looking rather downcast, and oc-
c sionally strengthening each other by wondering

rs. Winthrop is busy with various things at the
kitchen-table. Annie is packing a small trunk up-
stairs, and Grace is dressing in her very "Sunday
best." The childre  are everywhere, full of ex-
ci ement, they run up and down stairs, from the
k tchen to.Grace's rom, hindering every body.
With a sudden shout, Henry and Arthur go leap-
i g down stairs, and out the door. Ernest has just
d iven up with Mrs. Wheeler's shining gig, and
h ndsome Fearnaught harnessed before it. How
the daring request for the use of that gig was ever
g anted, nobody seemed to know. Ernest under-
t ok the negotiation, and its presence on this event.
f 1 morning, was ;sufficient proof 'of his "success.

"Ii' this basket are two chickens, icely roasted,
with plenty of bread and butter filled in ; and in
that one, you will find cake and cheese. Aunt
Lois brought over a pan of crullers. I have put
in as many as I could."
"Thank you, mother! I knew you would never
send us away empty. Ernest will like this, I am
sure."
"Yes, indeed," said Ernest, coming in .at that
moment," mother knows how to help travelers off."
It was soon time for the early din er, and all of
the family sat down to share it. Aunt Nannie
and Aunt Lois stayed too, for sad as it was, they
would not miss seeing "the children" off. Deacon
Winthrop's petition for blessing on the food, was
lengthened into a dedication of his sor and daughter
to any service in which their Heavenly Fath r
might accept them, and that in all their goin s
they night be kept from temptation ind sin.

It required all of Grace's fortitude to keep 'back
her tears, home seemed so inexpressibly dear, to
her just then, but the cheerful voices of the chil-
dren, and their wondering speculations as to what
ihe would see, helped her to be glad that she was
;oing. Nobody seemed very hungry, so there
was not a long sitting over the early meal. f/
And now came a bustle equal to the occa ion.
Ihe baskets were carried out, and stowed away in
:he box of the carriage. The trunk was strapped
n behind, each boy giving the strap a pull to
assure himself he had been useful in helping them
)ff. Bundles were bestowed in corners, and lastly,
clean bag, fill with oats, was laid on the bottom
)f the gig, and covered with a blanket.
"Yoi can use the bag for a footstool until the
)ats are gone," said Deacon Winthrop, "and then
f it rains, or is chilly, you will have the blanket to
Iraw over you."
Now came the adieus, and Grace and Ernest
vere seated in the gig all ready to go. Deacon
inthop must take one more survey of the horse
ind harness, and repeated his admonition to "drive
low, not to ride at evening, and be careful where
hey stopped over-night."
Mrs. Winthrop once more impressed on Grace
he importance of thoughtfulness in everything,
nd to be surely not to go out alone in Boston.
\unt Nannie added, "Don't get a cold, but if you
hould, be sure and ask your aunt to make you

Ernes touched Fearnaught with the whip and

away they drove, followed by every lessing which
such a household could bestow. The first ten
miles were familiar, then came new hills, and new
towns beyond them.
"Can you believe, Ernest," said Grace,' as she
rode along in quiet satisfaction; "that father and
mother have really consented to let u go. I almost
think we ran away."
"They all saw us start, if we did" said Ernest.
"So if they send out to find us, they will know
which way to come. Grandfather and grandmoth-
er looked very sober whgen I ran in there this morn-
ing on my way from Mrs. Wheeler's  And Uncle
Henry said he did n't see how mother ever gave
her consent to our going off like this."
"When. I went to tell them good -bye," said
Grace, "grandmother said she hoped nothing
would happen to us, but it was a great ways for'
such children to go alone. I told he I was nearly
seventeen,. and you are almost nineteen, and I asked
her if, she did not think we could ehave pretty
well when we tried. She smiled a ittle, and said
we were good children, but she wi hed we were

rdial grasp. " I was visiting down to your

first Sunday I was there, Henry nudged my elbow
and told me to look at that girl! I should think
that was the very one."
" People say I look like father's mother," said
Grace, not knowing what else to say.
"Is your name Annie ?"
"No, sir ; my sister has mother's name. I am
named Grace, after father's mother."
"A good name, and a worthy person who had
it. But come, mother," said he, addressing Mrs.
Wilbur, "you see that they have a good supper
while I look after the horse."
By the time the ;horse was well disposed of, the
supper-table was spread with its tempting old-
fashioned cheer, not forgetting a delicious pump-
kin-pie which Mrs. Wilbur had baked that very
afternoon, the first of the season. Their early din-
ner and long ride made our travelers hungry
guests, but they were obliged to declare them-
selves more than satisfied long before the variety
gave out. Then they were takes into the "spare
room," where Mr. Wilbur had kindled a little fire,
"just to take off the chill," he said.
Grace wondered where he found "the chill,"
for the day had been warm, and her unusual ex-
citement made it seem like midsummer; but the
blaze was cheerful, and she was disposed to enjoy
everything.
"I must begin to ask you questions t9-night,"
said -Mr. Wilbur,." or I shall not get through in
the whole of your visit."
"We shall have. to talk fast," said Ernest; 'for
we mustbe on our way again to -morrow morning."

The morning dawned fair and beautiful. Ernest
was up early to look after Fearnaught, but Mr.
Wilbur was before him, and Fearnaught had only
time to stop a moment over his ample measure of
oats to whinney his good-morning tQ his master.
A bountiful breakfast was waiting for them, and
Mrs. Wilbur had put them up such a lunch that
it was. hard to refuse ; but, as Grace told 'her,
"Mother had filled every spare corner."
"You shall, at least, take this pumpkin-pie," said
she.    .
Grace saw Ernest give it a wistful look, so she
determined to find room for it somewhere, which
she. accordingly did, quite to Mrs. Wilbur's satis-
faction ; and again, to use Aunt Nannie's peculiar
phrase, they "set away" on their all day ride,
carrying many cordial wishes for a successful jour-
ney, and giving, in return, a promise to call for a
night with these kind friends on their return.

fence eating on a board. Aunt Lois would call
us 'tramps,' and wonder somebody did not look
after us."
"Poor Aunt Lois !" said Ernest. -" She told me
the night before we came away that 'children took
a good deal on themselves now--a-days.' When
she was young, things were very different. I sup-
pose we have been on her mind most of the time
since yesterday noon ; but where is the cup, I
must have a drink  of water."
" Not out of this brook !" said Grace. "Fear-
naught may drink, and I'll wash my hands in it,
but we must wait until we come to a well."
" I do not believe a dinner is often more thor-
oughly enjoyed than this of our young friends
under the maple-trees, with now and then a golden-
tinted leaf dropping at their feet, or a wandering
squirrel pausing to see who could have invaded
his retreat. Behir d them lay home, father, mother,
brothers and siste s, an unbroken band, no feelings
of uncertainty as to what might happen while they
were gone, sadd ned their bright anticipations.
Before them was the long-talked-of visit, with its
half-formed visions of something different from,
and beyond anything they had ever seen. Few
such rests will come again in their life-journey;
but they do not know it now, and we will not dim
-heir clear sunshine with the dark clouds of com-
ing experience.
Fearnaught ad enjoyed it too. Ernest took off
his harness and let him have a good roll, and then,
leading him to the brook, left him to drink at his
leisure. " Nov', then, old fellow, you must do your

days come; the sun had set, and still they were
some miles from Uncle Josiah's.-.
"I have inquired for the town so long," said Er-.
nest, "that I almost .expect to see Uncle Josiah's
house the first thing when we get to it. Who
knows hoaw many miles we shall have to ride before
we come to it?"
At last the town was reached, and then came in-
quiries for Mr. Josiah Munson. Every body seemed
to know him, but that did not hinder his house
from being at the extreme end of the town,
stretching the twenty-five miles to nearly thirty,
and causing Ernest some anxiety lest Fearnaught
should be overtaxed.
At last the moon shone on a long brown house
which a passer-by said belonged to Mr. Josiah
Munson. Here, then, our travelers were to stop ;
so, fastening Fearnaught at the post, they went up
the path and knocked .at the front door. No an-
swer came. Only the moonbeams touching up the
sombre-looking dwelling gave any light to objects
within or without.
"hKock again," said Grace, after waiting for
some minutes; and knock, knock, went Ernest's
knuckles, as if he meant somebody should hear.
" Oh, dear !" said Grace, "it looks lonesome here.
I believe I am homesick."
Ernest smiled ; for his brave-hearted sister had
never faltered a moment before since he first told
her his wish to make the journey. " Har {.soma-
body's coming."
Just then an inner door opened, and there was a
pause, as if a listener ,waited. to hear a sound.

"'Where did you come from ? Is Henry with you ?
Come in, come in. Mother, bring a light. Do
you hear what he says? They are Henry Win-
throp's children !"
Mrs. Munson was not far away. Her surprise was
quite equal to,.her husband's... With  candle in one
hand, and the other extended in cordial welcome,
she advanced to meet them. "Why, children !
how did you come ?" said she. "How did you
ever find the way out here? When did you come
from home ?"
"Our horse and gig are at the gate," said Ernest,
"and we left home day before yesterday."
"Come right in ahd sit down by the fire," said
Mr. Munson; "the nights are coolish this time of
the year," and the old gentleman bustled round
with uncommon activity, and placed two high-
backed chairs in front of the fire. "I'm sorry

"Yes, sir," said Joseph, glad enough to have
something to do with the new-comers.
While Ernest had gone out, Mrs. Munson took
Grace into the spare-room to take off her bonnet
and shawl, and then seeing her comfortably seated
in one of the high-backed chairs, proceeded to get
supper. Mr. Munson went to the door every few
minutes, as if his anxiety.must make up for his ina-

" What made you think of coming to see us ?"
said the good old lady; "yohng folks don't usually
care about looking up old ones."
Then Ernest told his story of going to visit his
Uncle Edward.
" That's right !" said Mr. Munson; "but you ex-

"Not now. When we come back, we hope to
stop another night, and tell you about our visit."
"When we went to Beechford the last time,"
said Mrs. Munson, musingly, "I left a hou se full

now-and they have all gone. How time does

"Well, mother ! the clock says it is time for
these young folks to go to bed. If they must go
in the morning,. we must help them off."
"I'm so sorry about Jared's being away, but
they can't wait for him." Then the old man knelt
by his armed-chair, and thanked God for b inging
these ,young friends from his early home tp glad-
den his way with good tidings of those he loved to
remember. He prayed that they might be kept in-
safety by the way, and 'return with rejoicing to
their home. Rising from his knees, he extended a
hand to each of them, bidding them sleep soundly,
for they would need to be wide awake early to-
morrow.

in slow, indirect and tedious, dear friends were
ig oran of each other's welfare for months, and
so etimes for years. It required more relaxation
fr m care than usually tell to the heads of families
in Newx England, to accomplish a visit. To-day,
when we have every facility to keep upwith our
ab ent friends, we can hardly appreciate the im-
p0 tance which attached itself fifty years ago to
the arrival of a guest who brought tidings of ab-
se t .loved ones. It was equal to volumes of let-
te s, and files of newspapers; it freshened and
str ngthened old ties, and filled up a vacancy which
we never know. We must not stop to moralize, or
we may lose sight of Fearnaught, who trots off at
go d speed as if his night's rest had made him
equal tc the toils of the day. They were many
mi es from Uncle Josiah's when the silver watch
told the hour of twelve, and their prompt dinner

M artha's pie was an addition to its relish, and Un-

some farmer's by the way.
They rested again, as on the day before, and
then rode on until the afternoon shadows reminded
them that no more uncles or cousins were waiting
to welcome them, and they must begin to look out
for the 'tavern " about which Edward 'Nelson's
uncle hadl told- them. Fearnaught tried to make
the most of the waning daylight, but evidently he
was tire:1 ancd after going on. without. seeing any
house which looked 4s if it were waiting for tray-

Still they say if we can put up with such accom-

What do you say ?"
"I'm sure I do not know."
Fearnaught decided the case by a beseeching
whinny. He seemed to think he ought to be con-
sulted and his decision would be, "No more ex-
plorin to-night."
"T hat expresses your feelings, old fellow," said
Ernest, giving him  kindly pat. "You are. tired,
and have gone far .nough for one day. We will
take your advice. Come, Grace ; Fearnaught was
brought up at Beechford, and he knows what it is
best to do in this case," and helping his sister out
from the gig, he went with her into the house.
Mrs. Lester had disappeared, and a young lady,
evidently her daughter, came to meet them, and
took them into a little side-room, already well
filled with hoods and shawls.
"We have a good many friends with us this
evening," said the young lady. "My brother is
twenty-o e years old to-day, and father wanted to
notice it in some vay. A few of our friends will
stay all night, so w  shall have to give you a very
small room."
"That is much better than riding in a strange

lined with pink,I tink I should like a little chat
with its owner," an Ernest pointed to an unusu-
ally coquettish little head-covering which lay amid
a heap of grave one.
" For my part, I like the hoods best. I would
not go in the othe room for anything," said his
sister.
Grace had hardI finished her sentence before
the young lady who had met them at the door ap-
peared, to say tha her mother would be very
happy to have Mr. nd Miss Winthrop come into
the other room and spend the evening.
Miss Winthrop w s on the oint of declining the
invitation very decidedly, w len Ernest accepted
it. He was out on an expedition, and had left all
the cares which made him "as old as father" at
home with that'same father, and the novelty of
going with entire strangers rather pleased him.
Without appearing to notice his sister's reluctance,
he drew her hand i his arm, and followed Miss
Lester into the other room. Mrs. Lester came to
meet them, and conducted them to a seat, then,
with motherly pride she brought along her son,
who was the hero o the evening, and introduced
him.
Their entrance was rather an interruption to the
games which were going briskly on. "Who are
they ?" "Where did they come from ?" went in
sly wb ispers around the circle, until it was fairly
understood that Mr. and Miss Winthrop were
brother and sister, stopping over night on their
way to Boston.

which Ernest had eaten before dark, seemed to be-

prepared to do justice to the birth-night supper.
Grace had very little appetite, so she amused her-
self in a quiet observation of the mirthful company,
participating only as ,far as absolute politeness de-
manded.
It was son e time fter their return to the "front-
room," before Grac got an opportunity to tell her
brother how tired she' was, and how necessary it
was that they should get rested for their next day's
ride. Out of compassion for her, he excused both
her and himself to Mrs. Lester and her daughter,
and bidding them good-night, escorted Grace to
her little room close by his own. Many inquiries
were made after them, and many regrets expressed
at their early departure, but the festivity went on
while they slept, and were refreshed for their next
day's journey.

Ernest made, or of the winding ways he drove; it
is sufficient to say, that about twelve .o'clock Fear-
naught was drawn .up in front of an imposing,
three-story brick house, the like of which, neither
Erne t nor his sister had ever seen.
Gr ce followed. her brother up the broad stone
steps, feeling strangely forlorn, and wishing, with
all her heart, that she was standing at the old porch
at home. The huge,. brass knocker shone like
gold, even the lion's mouth- which held it looked
formidable, but Ernest had, not come all this way
to be daunted in the end, so he knocked bravely.
The summons was answered by a shining black
man, neatly dressed.. He held the door open with
a look of perplexed curiosity.
"Does Colonel Winthrop live here ?" said Ernest.
"Yes, sar," said Ralph.
"Is he at home ?"
"Yes, sar."
"I wish to see him."
The door was opened wider, and with a wonder-
ing look, as if he did not fully comprehend his vis-
itors, Ralph showed them into the parlor.
This was so different from the picture Grace had
drawn,! She thought her cousin Laura would
come to the door, and she should tell her who they
were, and then her uncle and aunt would come
right in, and they would be taken into the spare
.room, a great deal handsomer than theirs at home,
of course, but not in the least like this !

Ralph gave them another look, and went out,
leaving them alone in these wonderful parlors.
Colonel Edward Winthrop, the owner of this
stately mansion, and indeed the whol block in which
it stood, left his father's farm at Beechford, a youth
of seventeen, to serve his country in its mighty
struggles against oppression. Entering the army as
a private, he had, by his coolness, courage and mark-
ed ability to carry out plans, been raised to the rank
of Colonel. He suffered with the army in its
winter at Valley Forge, and shared in its victory
at Yorktowp. When peace was declared, and the
army disbanded, Colonel Winthrop Ihad acquired a
spirit of independent-adventure which the quiet
of his native hills would never sati fy. Through
some army acquaintances, he sought and obtained
an advantageous mercantile situation in an import-
ing house in Boston. Here his corr ctness of de-
portment, his unbending integrity, and his finan-
cial ability so thoroughly won the  onfidence of
his employers, that. in time they received him as
sharer, and t last into equal partnership with them-
selves in the firm. Wealth had come into his pos-
session with astonishing rapidity, and now at sixty-
two he is tall, erect, and very dignifie in his bear-
ing, with ceremonious habits, and fixed ways.
The dinner hour must not vary, the carriage must
be at the door for his daily drive at a near eleven
o'clock as possible. His wife he always expected to
accompany him at this hour, and his daughter, too,
unless she chose to do something els. It was so
manifestly his pleasure, that she counted it among
1.er daily duties. He always rode on horseback

before breakfast, but was sure to be back in time,
not to keep it waiting a moment;. His friends
called him cold, and unapproachable, still they en-
joyed .his genial moods. His hospitality was un-
bounded, his kindness reaching into many a poor
dwelling, where the donor was unknown.
Mrs. Winthrop was some ten years his junior.
She was born, and had lived in England, until her
eighteenth year, so that her tastes and habits par-
took strongly of her early education. Loving Col-
onel Winthrop devotedly she accepted his country,
and sympathized with him as, far as she could, but
their early training had been so different, that she
could never understand that part of his life which
had stamped the man so indelibly.
She had never visited the old homestead and
knew little of his brothers or the scenes of hisboy-
hood. He could not tell why he never spoke to
her of them; only such was his nature that he-*kept
them as hidden treasures. -He had met and won
her in scenes so widely apart from them that they
never blended in his mind. His father and mother
died before his marriage ; and without the bonds
of letters and occasional visits, he seemed, almost a
stranger to his e rly home. Of late his thoughts
had often gone ba k to the dear old starting-place,
and sometimes there would come a longing to
drink from the clear water of the well, or sit in the
old oaken chair on the porch. At times he could
almost hear the murmur of the little stream which
ran through (the middle of the farm, where he had
so often stopped to let the cows drink when he was
driving them home at night. Then he would think

bom in America had ever produced such a mavel
cf beauty ; it was a study in itself to their n-
sophisticated eyes. Then the mirrors! it would
surely tak e three or four of those at home to make
one of these; and the tables were so beautifully
carved, and the chairs were so handsome!
"Ernest," whispered Grace, "what is that long
narrow table on the other side of the room, with
so many twisted legs, it .looks as if it opened with
a lid."
"I don't know," said Ernest. "I'm getting pretty
near the end of my knowledge, and if Uncle Ed-
ward does not come before long, I shall find my
way back to Beechford. I had rather cut hay all
day than sit here perched up in this strange place."
"It is so different from anything I expected,"
said Grace, "it seems alniost like fairy land. Hark!
I hear somebody coming!" Just then the door
opened, and the stately man advanced to see who
waited for him.
With a native dignity, as rhuch a part of himself
as it was of his uncle, Ernest rose to ,meet him.
"It is Colonel Winthrop, I 'believe?" said he.
"Yes ;" and a pair of kecn eyes rested on the
young man's face with sudd n intensity.
"I am Ernest Winthrop, your brother Henry's
son, and. this is my sister Grace."
Grace had risen and stood by her 'brother's side,

"Laura," said he, goingto the door and speaking
to some one who had just come in, "I want you
here."
Laura came; the expression on her father's face
was unusual. She saw the strangers sitting near
the window ; she hardly comprehended when he
led her towards them and said, "Your cousins,
Grace and Ernest Winthrop, from Beechford."
She had heard of her Incle Henry, but of his
children she knew nothin . Sometimes in her
yearnings for brother or sister, she had wondered
if she had no cousins who could in any degree fil
the place, but she seldom sp ke to her father about
such things. One glance revealed that her cousin's
dress was provincial; but that sweet face! and
that irresistible charm of a refined nature which
spoke in the simple act of salutation,,opened Lau-
ra's heart at once. She felt that there had come
to her the very love she had so long desired. Er-
nest pleased her too; he did not seem out of. place
in his new surroundings. There was such a quiet
independent manner in his, greeting, that she felt
an involuntary respect for him.
"Come, daughter," said Colonel Winthrop, "take
your cousin up to your mother's roam."
"I suppose I must look after my' horse, Uncle,"
said Ernest, going to the window.
"Give yourself no trouble about him. I will see
that he is taken care of."

Mrs. Winthrop met her niece with kindness.
She was never demonstrative. She was glad she
was so pretty, and if her husband and daughter
were pleased at her coming, she was glad she had
come.
She came down to the parlor just before dinner
to be introduced to Ernest. She was very cor-
dial, and.even fancied he bore some. resemblance
to his uncle.
The announcement of dinner came very soon,
and our travelers who, for the last three days, had
dined by the road-side, found themselves seated at
an elegant table in a richly-furnished dining-room..
The goblets were of silver, the dishes all perfectly
matched, and Ralph, the shining black man, who
met them at the door, took his place behind his
master's chair. Grace instinctively felt that here
was a new place, and that awkwardness or mistake
would annoy her uncle especially. It was a mutual
mystery to. herself and Ernest how they ever got
through with 'that, ceremonious dinner. They
thought of home, and the table set with blue-and-
white dishes, and di-shes that were, not white-and-
blue. Several variet es they could have mention-
ed-it was not the dishes, it was the freedom they
.were thinking of, and they wished Ralph would
have some errand that would take him out. of the

room entirely. It seemed to them  ha4 they could'
not eat while he stood there watching them.
Then tney thought of their last thre dinners, how
free and easy they had been with orly the squirrels
to watch them. They felt greatly relieved when,
at last, they rose from the 'table without having
made any positive mistake. "Going to Boston"
was a more wonderful undertaking than they had
imagined.
"I shall go to drive this afternoon, and take Ernest
with me,"'said Colonel Winthrop.
Grace went to her room to unpack her trunk,
and to begin a letter to her mother.
Laura went to her mother's room. "Is n't she
lovely, mother ?"
" Yes, she is ; but you must put a few touches to
her dress. You can attend to tha better than I
can. She might think I was finding fault."
About an hour 'after, Laura tapped lightly at
her cousin's door, and found her busily writing to,
her mother.
" I was going to ask you to let e come in and
sit with you, but I shall interrupt you."
" Never mind that. I did not intend to finish
my letter until I had seen Ernest again. 'Do come
in."
It was astonishing how rapidly their acquaint-
ance progressed. Laura was asking about "mother
and Annie and father and the boys and little Mary,"
and Grace felt as if talking about them to an inter-
ested listener was next to seeing them.
After awhile Laura unrolled a beautiful piece of
ribbon which was lying in her work-basket. " Isn't

FIFTY YEARS AGO.

that pretty ?" said she, handing it to Grace. "I
bought it this morning to trim my bonnet."
Grace had. never seen anything so beautiful in
the way of ribbons, so she expressed her admira-
tion of it.
" I am going to treat you just as if you were
my sister," said Laura; "and as I never had one,
maybe I shall- be tyrannical. But you must not
rebel. You must not say a word if I put this rib-
bon on your bonnet and get some' more for my-
self." She took Grace's bonnet in her hand as she
spoke, and laid the rich ribbon over it. "There !"
said she. "Your straw is very white and neat-
looking, but I know you cannot get such ribbon in
Beechford."
Grace did not tell her she went six miles on
horseback to get a brand-new ribbon for this very
visit, and paid more for it than for any she or
Annie had ever owned before; how Aunt Lois
had admired it, and thought there' could be none
in Boston to vie with it. She only thanked. her
cousin in her own sweet way, and begged her to
do just as she pleased with her bonnet.

CHAPTER VI.
INCIDENTS OF THE VISIT.
NATE sill leave Laura and Grace to their pleas-
ant chat, and follow Colonel Winthrop and
his nephew in their afternoon drive.. Colonel Win-
throp had not been long in discovering that. his
nephew's coat did not do him full justice. If there
had been no way to remedy it, he would have
thought it a very secondary' consideration ; but
there was, and, with a feeling of relief that he
could express his joy at seeing him in some tangible
way, he ordered John to drive to his tailor's.
Leaving Ernest in the carriage, he went in to in-
quire how soon it was possible to make a new suit
for a' young gentleman.
"We will attend to it immediately," said the
proprietor. "Wait a moment, sir, if you please,",
said he, as if a sudden thought had struck him.
"We have just made a suit for a young gentle-
man, a very handsome one. Unfortunately there
was a mistake in the size, and he has brought them
'back. They are a size too large, anyway. Per.-
haps, as you are in a hurry, you would like to look
at them."
Colonel Winthrop examined she garments which

the tailor produced,' and pronounced them just
what he wanted, provided they would fit. Telling
the man he would return soon, he went ont to
Ernest. Speaking so that John need not hear,.he
said, " I want you to go in here with me, and ac-
cept what I do, just the same as if you were with
your father. If he thought you ought to have a
new coat, you would not refuse it. if I can afford
to buy it better than he can, then it is my right to,
I think, so you must come in with. me here for a
few minutes and do just as I think best."
It was Ernest's turn to be amazed now. He be-
gan to say something, but his uncle stopped him
by saying, "No time for words now,; this is ac-
tion."
There was something so decided and prompt in
his manner that .Ernest started as if he must 'be
out of the car iage' and following him quickly.
Once before they reached the door he managed
to ejaculate " Uhcle !" but the rest of it was never
heard, for he was hurried on and into the back
room to try on lie-new suit.
It was prono nced a perfect fit; and if he could
have fully understood the light in his uncle's face,
he would have k own that this outlet was reliev-
ing the pent-up emotions of his heart. It was the
first active expression he had given to the mem-
ory of his home in Beechford for m py years,
and he wondered if it could be true that such an
opportunity ha really come to him to-day !
He enjoyed 3rnest's looks of surprise, remon-
strance, appreci tion and gratitude; and as they
continued their ride, and he :attempted to thank

him, he stopped him by saying, " I know you are
pleased, and so am I; now we are on equal terms.
Remember, I was once a little boy in the same
house where you have grown up--that the same
parents loved your father and myself; and now,
when it is so many years since I have heard from
that home, I want you. to understand how glad I
am that you came to tell me about it."
By this time they had reached home.
You can, at least, dress for tea," said his uncle,
smiling.
Fortunately Ernes met no one as he carried his
bundle to his own room.
Grace,. at Laura'ssuggestion, had arrayed her-
self in Annie's silk. It seemed to her like trespass-
ing, for Annie never wore it except on very pleas-
ant Sundays, or on some great occasion. She
smoothed its folds very tenderly, and assured her-
self that she would treat it with great care ; but,
of course, she must wear it if Laura wanted
her to.
"I like the way you arrange your hair," said
Laura. , Now, you must wear this collar and rib-
bon, and here is a ribbon for your hair to match the
one for your neck."
It seemed to Grace a ldng time since she h q
seen Ernest, and as Laura was not quite ready, s e"
thought she would go down to the parlor, hopir
to find him alone. She drew back as she was en-
tering, for a strange gentleman was there, standing
with his back to her.as he looked out of the win-
dow. She turned to go away, supposing herself to
be unseen. The gentleman turned around and

.Tea was less elaborate than dinner had been.
Grace did not pay so much attention to the beau-
tiful silver service as she'would have done if her
eyes had not wandered continually over to the fine-
ly dressed gentleman who sat opposite her. There
was a merry twinkle in her eye which could scarce
be held in check by her strange surroundings. The
evening brought some friends of Colonel and Mrs.
Winthrop to call. Colonel Winthrop introduced
his nephew and neice with evident pleasure, and
they quietly enjoyed their new surroundings.
"Come, daughter," said Colonel Winthrop, "give
us some music. Your cousins would like to hear
some, too, I suspect."
The gentleman with whoin Laura was convers-
ing rose immediately, and went with her across the
room to the "long table with twisted legs," which.
had attracted Grace's attention when they sat
waiting for their.uncle. He raised the lid, and
Laura drew out a curious chair from under "the
table,"placed some music in front of-her, and with
her fingers on the-ivory keys, made such a delight-
ful combination of sweet sounds,'that her cousins
were silently enraptured. They exchanged most
expressive glances; no other manifestat on showed
that they had never heard or 'seen a piano before.
When Grace laid her head on her pillow that
night, she tried to realize all that had befallen her
since she left home, but it seemed weeks and weeks
ago. Even this first day in Boston had been long-
er than three ordinary ones. She felt a ittle afraid
of her uncle and aunt, and yet she liked them both.
She was delighted with Laura. She wondered

how Ernest lik d them. She had so much to say
to him, but she did not see as there would be much
opportunity urtil they were on their way home.
She woke the next morning to wonder where she
was-a wonde{ which her waking senses quickly
dissipated. Laura came for her soon after she was
dressed, and they went down-stairs together. Col-
onel Winthrop had returned from his morning
ride, and Ernest from a short walk. Mrs. Win-
throp soon joi ed them, and .then breakfast wa
ready. Ernest spent the morning with his uncle,
who took him to places of interest in the city
Grace went wi h her cousin on a shopping expedi
tion. All he   life long .she had , only known
the buying w ich necessity prompts. it seemed
strange to see aura selecting from so. many beau.
tiful things just what her taste dictated; such
marvels of silk and ribbons almost confused her.
She had never even thought of such stores where
ladies chose shades and fabrics as their fancy dic-
tated. Occasionally she expressed h r admiration,
but her wonde ing thoughts were no often suffer
ed to escape. As Laura afterwards told her moth
er, "She took o pretty things so naturally."
The dinner id not seem quite so tedious to her
the second da . She enjoyed the long, delightful
drive afterwards, and listened with great interes
as her uncle jointed out paces of revolutionary
interest. The  the grand harbor, with its white
sails and many islands stretched away in the dig.

surroundings, nd made home seem dearer than it
had since they left it.
The Sabbat- daypassed on. Ernest and. Grace
remembered the gathering in the "spare-room "
at home ; they knew that they were missed and
remembered there.   With Monday came new
'plans for riding and sightseeing: Colonel Win-
throp, with his usual precision, had arranged t
have their whole visit comprise as much of Bosto
-and its belongings as would be possible to get mto
the time allotted for it. At first he objected to it
shortness, but at last compromised the matter by
insisting on Ernest's writing to his father that, in-
stead of leaving on Thursday as they intended,
they should wait until the following Monday. The
only real objection was the gig, and that they
thought Mrs. Wheeler would excuse when they
explained it to her. Ernest's school did not com-
mence until the first of November, so he had the
time on that account. Colonel Winthrop pro-
posed. that Ernest should join him in his morning
rides on horseback. Fearnaught always had the
appearance on these occasions of being occupied
with some mysterious subject, which he vainly tried
to solve. It was plainly evident that there was
something wrong in his surroundings. He neighed
at Ernest in a demanding sort of way, as if he alone
could tell him what all this meant, and where "his
barn and pasture lot could be found. Grace watch-
ed h m from the window, and longed to go out and

ively that her uncle would not like t have her;
he did not understand what a familiar, home-friend
this favorite horse was. Laura and Grace were
becoming excellent friends. Laura made so many
improvements in her toilette, in such a delicate
way, that she never felt hurt by seeming to be de-
ficient in the many luxurious articles which were
so,.indispensable to her cousin.
It was Thursday evening, and they had been near-
ly a week in Boston. Colonel Winthrop, with his
hands folded behind him, was taking his customary
walk back and forth throb gh the parlors. Mrs.
Winthrop, leaning back in her easy-chair, silently
contemplated the group at the piano. Ernest was
finding a song which he wished Laura to sing.
Laura was softly playing a prelude whilst 'she
waited for the song. Grace's attitude was one of
unconscious repose. She was thinking of how
Annie would enjoy the music, and o how many
things she would have to tell her when she got
home.
Thus communing with herself, her face reflected
the quiet happiness within. "My mother!" said
Colone Winthrop, to himself, "how she comes
back to me in that face; I cannot spare it yet."
"Grace!" said he, pausing in his w lk directly
in front of her, " I think we must keep you
here all winter, and let Ernest go back with-
out you."
"Father!" said Laura, turning suddenly around,
"that is just what I have been thinkin  about to-
day.'. I -should be delighted to have  er stay all

be glad too ?"
"bCertainly, daughter. I think it is quite singu-
lar that we should each have.thought of it without
speaking to any one about it."
Grace did not say a word; the proposition was
so unexpected, and so impossible, that she only
looked her astonishment at Ernest. Then there
came such a vision of home, and the dear ones
gathered there, that her heart nestled back asiif it
would rest in it forever.
" Oh, thank you, uncle !" said she, recalling her-
self enough to know that they were all waiting for
her answer. "I could not let Ernest go. back
alone; besides, mother and 'Annie need me very
much this winter."
"Suppose 'I should write to them, and tell them
how much we need you here? -I.think they would
consent."
"Oh, yes !" said Laura," we will all write ; I must
have you for a sister.. I was thinking to-day, that
it was you I had- been wanting for a long time.
You will let her stay, cousin Ernest, won't you ?"
"I hardly know what to say. I think mother
would be very much disappointed to see me com-
ing home without her."
"I know she would," said Grace. "I have had
a delightful visit, and shall want to come again very
much; but I do not believe, uncle, I could let Er-
nest go home without.me." Her tones were al-
most tremulous, for the thought of that dear home
fading out, of sight for the whole winter was full.of
uridefined sarrow..

with Ernest. I had to urge mother very hard to
let me come for only a week, and I know she will not

effort, and she waited: to see how it was received.
" Well then ! I have thought of a new plan.

"Do you really mean you will come to Beech-

"It is looking into an uncertainty. I do not
know what may happen to prevent, but you and
Ernest have made me feel so like a boy again, that
I am very anxious to see the old place once more.
I should like to have your aunt and cousin see the
spot where I was once young like you."
"I should be "delight d with that plan, father,"
said Laura; "only I ha1 rather keep Grac now,
and take her home fo : a visit then. It is a long
time to wait-a whole year."
" Oh! it will come quickly, Laura," said Gi ace,
with one of her pleased smiles. "I should like that

so glad to see you, and then they might think it
best to. let me come back with you."

"Will you come ?" said Laura, rathe sadly.
"If they will let me. I should be very happy
here, if I had come from home expec ing to stay
away so long, and they were reallywilling to let me."
Ernest rode up to, the carriage jut .then, and
Grace 1 aned out to tell him of their u cle's propo-
sition. He smiled his approval of th settlement
so heartily, that his sister felt that he. as as much
relieved by it as she was herself.
Ernest rides splendidly," said Laur .
'" Yes, yes," said her father, "we had a fine gallop
this morning; it almost made a young man of me.
Even your mother told me this morning that I had
grown fifteen years younger in the last week."
Mrs. Winthrop smiled quietly. She was accus-
tomed to seeing her husband polite, but unap-
proachable even to his most familiar fri nds, and it
did seem to her strange that these two young peo-
ple, with whom he had no particular association,
should so move him. She had never thought of
him as related to anybody but herself and Laura.
She enjoyed the new phase in his character, and con-
gratulated herself that his nephew and niece were
presentable; "for," said she to Laura, "if they
had been awkward and disagreeable, your father
would have insisted on having his brother's chil-
dren made conspicuous when they came so far to
look him up."
"But she is lovely, mother! Henry Marshall
told me last night that she had one of t e sweetest
faces he ever saw.
"Your father says she has so. much character.
He thinks there is something about h r so much

like your grandmother. He says she could sur-
mount almost any difficulty, and always made
things look bright and cheerful about her. He
has told me more about her since Grace came,
than I ever heard him say before. Did you notice
last night how he drew Gr4ce on to tell him how
she and Ernest ever got their mother's consent .to
making this journey. He told me afterwards that
I could not understand the difficulties that lay in
the way as he did. But he was convinced that
Grace had his mother's way of accomplishing what
she set about doing."
" Well, I like her as much as father does. I
think they have enough at Beechford without her,
and 1 wish she would be content to stay with us."
"There is not much use in wishing at present.
We would not want a captive: and I am sure she
would be one, if she staid now. Your father thinks
he shall surely go to Beechfo 'd next year. Then
she may like to come home wlth us."
It was a great relief to Grace, when she found
the idea of. going to Beechford was making things
smooth. It grieved her, after receiving so much
kindness,-to seem so unwilling to stay longer with
her friends, and perhaps, by another year, her
fath r and mother. might think ,it best, and she
might want to come back very much.

CHAPTER VII.
"HOMEWARD BOUND."
M      ONDAY morning came. Fearnaughi, look-
ing fresh and sleek from the hand of his city
groom, stood harnessed before Mrs. Wheeler's gig
ready to carry our adventurers home. He pawed
the stones with .an impatient hoof, as if some new
idea had taken possession of him. .Home must be
somewhere in the wide world, and he was deter-
mined to find it. Grace's trunk was packed to
overflowing. It was astonishing how much it
could be made to hold. Besides, there was a
carpet-bag filled with remembrances for those at
home. Not one of them had been forgotten. The
box of the gig was packed full. Aunt Nannie and
Aunt Lois" had each a white neckerchief. Laura
had been so-.interested in Grace's description of
them that she wanted to send them something, and
Grace had suggested these. Even Fearnaught's
bag for oats was filled with packages which were
never designed for him to eat up.
At last, everything being ready, our travelers
took leave of the friends who had welcomed them'
so cordially, and done so much to make their visit

Ernest gave a meaning rap on his pocket.
",Uncle was equal to mother, only in another way.-
He gave me money enough to .take us home.
We can have a good dinner if we can find it."
"How kind he was. At first it seemed strange ;
but I kept thinking he was father's brother, and
then I did not wonder so much.'"
"Yes," said Ernest; "-if a stranger had taken
me to a tailor's and dressed me up, I should have
thanked him, and ut on my old clothes again. I
did feel rather uncomfortable at first, as it was ;
but I thought father would have been just as gen-
erous if he had had Uncle Edward's purse ; and I
know, by the way he did it, he meant it."
Ernest left his incle's house in these same new
clothes, but the second morning of their journey
he folded them carefully up and attired himself-in
the garments he had worn away from home.
Their ride was marked by no especial incident.
They spent one night at their Uncle Josiah's
whose welcome-was like one who had known'them
for years. The shortness of their stay was all that
troubled him. H6 wished to hear all about "Ed-
ward" and.Boston, and sent so many messages to

and "your grandfather and grandmother," that
Grace was afraid she should forget them amid the
multitude of things she should have to say.
"Tell them that I shall go home before long,
and I shall expect to see them coming, when their
work on earth is done. And I want to see you
there, too, my dear children; .don't forget that.

"He told me he had no active connection with
the firm in which he used, to do business, but he
had influence, and he would remember me if a de-
sirable vacancy should occur. In the meantime,
he advised me to read and study all I can keep on
teaching, and working with father for, at least, a
year longer. He encouraged me very much by say-
ing that young mien who are educated -i such a
home as ours make the firm, reliable men of the
country. He saic I would never be a loser by
staying with father, at least, another year, unless a

more like a glad child as they drew nearer home.

mysterious wrappings.
"Children !" said Mrs. Winthrop, in a tPne of au-
thority, "don't you touch one of the bundles until
Grace gets ready to open them. I shall send you
away unless you are more quiet."
Ernest's first care was to take the carriage back

and son clasped hands most warmly. Grace was
not' far away, and quickly ran out to greet her
father. ~

crowned the home-table that night, made a picture
refreshing to remember; for remember i they will

"Come, children," said Mrs.: Winthrop, "that
will do; you must be more quiet or I shall send
you to bed." This was a quietus. Children have
a natural aversion to going to bed, especially if
anything unusual is going on. Arthur and Mary
subsided at once; being the youngest they knew
they were in the greatest danger of banishment.
The old porch vas neglected now, for the even-
ings had grown so chilly. A cheerful fire blazed
on the hearth in the sitting-room, and sent a ruddy
glow over.the' white walls and simple furniture. A
little round stand was in the middle of the room,
on which burned two tallow candles. Mrs. Win-
throp and Annie had honored the occasion by
"only knitting to-night." There was so muchto
say they wanted to give their whole attention.
Deacon Winthrop sat in his armed-chair in the
corner revealing, even by the "fitful fire-light,"' a
face on, which was written, in well defined expres-
sion, "Godliness with contentment is great gain."
Ernest sat opposite him with little Mary on his lap.
Grace's face was lowing with animation as she
repeated incident after incident of her visit. Ar-
thur sat on a low  ench at her side. Henry leaned
over the back of her chair and played with her
curls, expressing thus his caressing gladness at her
return; while Charles, a step.higher in the scale
of boyhood, sat demurely in his chair quietly di-
viding- his attention between .Grace's story and
Ernest's new clothes. It was a beautiful picture,
over and around which the light of home love was
laying.

inthrop.
Ernest took Annie's chair by the stand and read
a clear, reverent voice the inspired -words,' so
ted to convey the grateful emotions of the soul
r continued mercies.  Especially did Deacon
inthrop dwell on the words, "Bless the Lord, oh
y soul, and forget not all His benefits."
Even little Mary never forgot her father's prayer
at night; it seemed to fold them all so tenderly
thin the Saviour's arms, and though she did not
lly comprehend, she did not wonder that her
other's face was tear-wet when she kissed her
od-night.

CHAPTER VIII.
DOCTOR ALLERTON.
MONG the first items of news which Annie
communicated, was the arrival of a new doc-
at Beechford. Old Doctor Stanhope had min-
red long and faithfully. He was regarded as one
he institutions of the place; but of late years
strength had declined, and the fact that he must
ner or later.give his duties into younger hands,
growing more and more apparent. Nobody
compelled to take the responsibility of inviting 'a
one into the place. As long as Doctor Stan-
e could ride out, he seemed a reliance. Sud-
ly Doctor Allerton appeared in their midst,
ging very reliable credentials from very re-
ctable sources. He called on some of the lead-
people of the town, and received from them suffi-
nt e encouragement to decide him to take up his
)de w th them for the present. He had procured
oardi g place.in a good location, near the cen-
of t e town, and, by the middle of November,
ectel to establish himself in Beechford.
How old is he ?" asked Ernest.
Twenty-eight, I believe."
Is he good looking ?"
(103)

"He i s fine looking, and very social and gen-
tlemanly, 57ou would never think of calling him
handsome; 'but there is something about him wh ch
attracts your attention and commands your respect.
Father and mother liked him very much. By the
way, Ernest, he proposed to father to take a class
of young ladies and gentlemen for the winter. He
said he, should probably have to wait for practice;
and if Mrs. Lee would let him have an extra room,
he could devote a couple of hours three evenings
in each week to recitations, with the privilege of
being professionally absent, if it should be neces-
sary. Ordinary practice he could regulate so as
not to interfere with these hours."
"Capital !" said Ernest; "just the thing we want.
I will call on Doctor Allerton this very evening."
"But he will not be here in two weeks; so mod-
erate your joy, young man," said Annie, with mock
gravity.
."Well, then, I'll do what I can to get up a class
when he gets here. I shall have time enough to
study, these .long winter evenings. I have been
wishing, of all things, for just this opportunity ;
and it has come almost as unexpectedly as my new
suit did. Hurrah for Dodtbr Allerton, say I! Be-
hold me, his attached friend !"
"hReally !" said Annie, ' you begin your rejoic-
ings in good season. Yogi had'better wait and see
where the scholars are coining'from."
"No, I sha'n't wait. I m going to do allI can to
help him find scholars, and if nobody else cares to
study, I think I shall offer myself as a private pupil.
I can't get sick, to induce him to stay ; but I'm

" Suppose you should be disappointed in him ?"
"From your account, I do not expect to be."
A nie," said Grace,' " do you believe mother
'ill let me go? I want to go to school this winter,
nd I m sure this will be an excellent opportunity.
believe Julia Thorn, and Mary Ross, and all the
irls will go."
"Yes," said Ernest, "I'll answer for her. Mother
lways approves of schools. So 'll put you down
cholar number two, and leave  ou to make the
rrangements for getting there.  ome, I'll go with
ou to Julia Thorn's this evening, and get her name
nd Charlie's."
"The very thing I wanted you to do. I have
carcely seen Julia since I came back, and I've got
great deal to tell her."
"But, remember, you go in my interests to-
ight ;-first the school, and your talk afterwards."
Ernest's efforts for the next few eenings were
ond rfully successful. He had twenty names
nough to form a fine clasa of really determined
pint. Charlie and Julia Thorn Edward Nelson,
nd   ary Ross, were among the  embers.
Gr ce had obtained her mother's permission to
join t e class. Mrs. Winthrop did not exactly like
n evening school, but as the necessities of her son
ould be met in no oth r way, sh made as few ob-
ectio s as possible.  here were fher good moth.

ould they withstand it ! ' '   *,

For convenience, it was arranged that each
young man, in his turn, should carry all the pupils
in his neighborhood. They had yet to submit
their plans to Doctor Allerton, and now his coming
had grown to be very important.
Doctor Allerton came at the appointed time, and
was quite'surprised to find himself so anxiously
expected and so warmly welcomed by Ernest Win-
throp, Charles Thorn, and Edward Nelson, as a
committee from the class to make arrangements for
hearing their recitations. He met them very cor-
dially, and after talking the subject over in its va-
rious aspects, he invited. thenA to call with the
whole number of proposed pupils the next evening.
The evenings they mentioned would suit his con-
venience. At present they interfered with none of
his arrangements. It must be understood that he
should be at liberty to attend to any unexpected
call. The young men left, highly pleased with
their interview, and quite enthusiastic over their
plans for study.
And now, a word about Doctor Allerton. He
was, as Annie said, about twenty-eight years old,
with a strong, well-developed physical frame. His
eyes were deep hazel, and full of expression. There
was something in them which made you involun-
tarily feel that their owner looked beneath the sur-
face and was forming an opinion of his own. His
firm, well-set mouth expressed fixedness of purpose.
He had fine natural talents, was gifted with a rare
memory, which placed his knowledge of men and
books at a ready and practical command. His
manners were courteous, and his powers of conver-

tion unusually fine. He had studied faithfully,
ad a natural love for his profession, and a hopeful
ispos tion to inspire his efforts: All ready to work!
ut" there .should he go ?" had been a difficult
uestion to solve. Cities and larger places were
lled with toilers in his profession, and he had no
ieans to support him in years of waiting. The
oungest of a large family, he had been tenderly
sared by a widowed mother, and received from
er such lessons of wisdom, that his heart was filled
rith high purposes and, earnest desires for useful-
ess. "Do not be ambitious about place, my son,"
te had said to.him, when he was filled with anx-
ity a out his field for labor. "Fird something to
o, and do it well. Then leave the results with
rod. Honor him, and he will honor you enough
r your earthly needs." His uncle, whom he had
onsulted, and who was himself a physician of high
andi g, had recommended his present location.
Bee hford is a quiet town," said he, "possessing
reat natural beauty. The people are staid and
itelligent. I think you will find strong elements
f growth among them. You will not want for
lateri l on which to exercise your knowledge and
kill, for disease reveals itself as surely in the coun-
ry as in the city. A well stored mind, capable of
ringi g its power to bear upon the occasion, is at
ome, and in its place, be that place city or coun-
ry." So, taking his letters of introduction, he had
ome to Beechford to meet with as cordial a re.
eption as any stranger could, expect. The plan of
°achi g had suggested itself as'accomplishing a
iree- old purpose. It would be a slight foothold

in the way of certain occupations. It would
him into closer acquaintance with the young
ple, and it would open a way of usefulness i
parting instruction to others. Of course, it
cheering to find himself so pleasantly expe
when, with his few worldly effects, one chilly
vember day, he returned to take up his abo

On the appointed evening, the young physician
received the proposed members of his class in-Mrs.
Lee's pleasant sitting-room. His easy, happy man-
ner did much towards overcoming the stiffness of
the occasion. He made his inquiries of each one
so quietly, and drew them out so unconsciously,
that the reserve gradually wore away, and he was
enabled to get some definite idea of the plan of
study best adapted to their wants. He arranged
for as few classes as possible, made suggestions as
they occurred to him, and formed a general plan
subject to such improvements as his better knowl-
edge of their needs would enable him to adopt.
As he knew better than they where, and how: to
buy books, it was proposed that he should furnish
them. This would cause some delay, and as Thanks-
giving was not far off, he suggested that they should
wait until its festivities were passed before they
entered upon their winter's work.
Thi4 met with a cordial response from them all.
And thus their first meeting passed pleasantly
away. They were pleased with Doctor Allerton,
pleased with the new arrangements, and pleased
with each other.

Doctor Allerton improved. his time by c
on all of his, proposed pupils, and becoming
acquainted \ith them. He was very much pl
with Ernest Winthrop. He found him thi
for instruction, and anticipated pleasure i
companionship.
Ernest had spent two evenings at his office
given.him some insight into his silehtly-che

Doctor A lerton had also spent one eveni
Deacon Winthrop's, where he mad  himself

- "Why, Grace !" said Ernest, in astonishment,
"I thought you like Doctor Allerton."
" So I do, in his way. But he is so old and
wise. I want to 1ugh and be happy over my
Thanksgiving-dinner, and I shall feel as .solemn as
I used to at uncle's able if he come"."
" It would be a pity to make you 4#ela'ncholy on
Thanksgiving -day," said Annie. \ I shall not

silent, and I doubt i even 'wise old Doctor Aller-
ton' can make you act uch a part."
"I don't care. I don't want him to come. Do
you, mother ?"
"Let'it go, daughter," said Deacon Winthrop.
"Mother will not miss him, and you may lahigh
as much as you like. I suppose you do not object
to your grandfather, grandmother and Uncle
Henry on account of their age."
" Oh! no, indeed! They are part of my Thanks-

Annie wants a certain Mr. Ross, I shall not mind

Annie blushingly told her that she should be
able to enjoy her Thankskiving dinner with grand-

just as well as she should ; so she need not invite
anybody on her account.

Thanksgiving morning dawned one of the 1
est, cheeriest of the whole month. There w
keenness enough in the air to make it exhil
and send the blood tingling through the vei
parting -a glowing life, which made itself f4
a blessed possession.
Aunt Nannie and Aunt Lois were always
of the Winthrop's on Thanksgiving -day..
usually rode' to, church with them aind cam4
to dinner, but to-day Aunt Lois insisted upo
ing at home to help "Mis' Winthrop."
"I reckon I can fix potatoes and turnips
equal to any body. Let Annie and Grace b(
to meeting, and I'll look after things while th
gone."
To "look after things" meant a great deal
Aunt Lois said it.  Annie and Grace kn
well what an extensive ground it covered
they felt that their places would be well sup
so they weje soon ready to go with the rest
family to church. ,The boys wore their new
nut-colored suits and Mary her  right,
dress.
The sermon was sound and excellent, but
scarcely appreciated by the younger meml
the congregation, their thoughts were so oc
with sundry things at home. If Grace, for
meant, felt t at she had been selfish in not w
Doctor Allerton to share in their leasant
dinner, she was relieved when Julia  horn tc

Aunt Lois had lighted the wood which. Ernest
had laid in the fire-place in the "spare room." It
glowed and sparkled, and sent up fantastic flames,
and looked cheery enough to wake up a spirit of
thankfulness in anybody's heart.
The old mirror opposite reflected its glow, and
seemed to kindle and keep up just such a fire, on
its side of the room; even the cherry tables tried to
twinkle with little fires all over their polished sur-
faces. In the sitting-room, the bright blaze leaped
out between the great sticks cf walnut-wood, then
suddenly disappeared, and soon revealeditself in
a broad, enveloping sheet, sending out such waves
of genial warmth that they pervaded every corner
of the room. The door between the two rooms
was open, and everything wore a festal look, which
the fires seemed to vie with eachother in keeping
up. Modern furnaces warm as well, but they haye
no language, they are dull, gloomy, uninviting
companions, only tolerated because they are so
convenient. When the dear, old -fashioned fire-
light went. out, a charming household spirit went
with it. That spirit was at the old mansion to-day
working faithfully, and well did it succeed.
The dinner-table was always in the sitting-room
on Thanksgiving-day. -This was left for Grace to
arrange-only Grace could produce such an effect
with such limited means. Every choice 5lish the
house afforded was pressed into service, and with
the ground-pine, "Everlasting," and bitter-sweet
berries, which she and Aunt Lois had- collected,
the table was prettily adorned.  There were
bunches of ground-pine, dotted witi everlasting,

Winthrop disappeared to.add a few touches to her
holiday dress.
Then the family, fourteen in all, gathered round
the table. Grandfather always asked the blessing
on Thanksgiving-days. The .family stood instead
of sitting while he said grace in his own peculiar
patriarchal way. The clatter of knives, forks and
plates announced that the feast had begun. Every-
thing was goo1, and enjoyed to its fullest extent.
Love presided, giving to grandfather's laugh a
merry ring, and to grandmother's faded face and
silvery hair a quiet beauty; it touched father,
mother and Uncle Henry with smooth "erasing
fingers,", making the care lines almost invisible.
It revealed itself to Annie, Ernest and Grace in
bows of golden promise, and into the children's
hearts it poured floods of undefined happiness over
which no shadow rested ; it whispered gently to
Aunt Nannie and Aunt Lois that past trials were
only seeds of quiet joy ripening in their autumn
years, and enduring enough to afford them shelter
as far into life's winter as they should need.

blessing, mde for us such a starting point in, life,
and whose influence over us can never end.
Mrs. Wiinthrop realized it as her eye rested fond-
ly on the faces of her father and mother. She felt
that in the home where she was mother, her moth-
er's life work was carried on, and that her father's
wisdom and counsel had made her stronger for the
right.
Ernest in his new suit was the perfect admira-
tion of his brothers, while Annie and Grace in
their bright ribbons, looked more than beautiful to
them. Mary expressed her views particularly to
her confidant Arthur, and taking it altogether was
one of the most satisfied little beings that day's
Thanksgiv ng sun shone upon.
"Don't you feel sorry, Grace, that you would
not let Doctor Allerton have a taste of this good
dinner?". hispered Ernest, as h  sat next his
sister.
"No!    hy should I.  Mr. Wilson took him
home with him, besides, if we had any company, I
should rather have Julia and Charli Thorn."
Doctor Allerton's con ing was fully discussed by
the older members of the family, an was approved
of by all. Doctor. Stanhope had received him
kindly, and expressed himself as  eling relieved
from a heavy burden by his coming. He had re-.
ceived no professional calls as yet, but he had only
been there two weeks, and it was a time of unusual
health.
Grand other did not know about the evening-
school. ay-time seemed best to her for such

things, still she wanted Ernest to attend it, and
that rather modified her views.
When dinner was over, Aunt Lois.said, "Now,
Mis' Winthrop, fou go right in the other room, and
see 'your folks,( Nannie and I don't want you
'round. Annie and Grace may clear off the table
and put things to rights in this room, and then we
don't want any more of them."
Mrs. Winthrop hesitated,. but Aunt Lois again
assured her that she would "look after things,"
which in this case meant put all the broken
pieces and right slices into the baskets waiting to.
receive them when their poor owners came for
them .before dark. Aunt' Lois knew the li~t of
Mrs. Winthrop's "poor folks," and Mrs. Winhrop
knew her kindness and judgment were equal te the
occasion, so she went in with her father, mother,
and husband, to chat by the glowing fire in the
spare room. The children were in and out, some-
times bringing wood to heap on the fire, then a
pan of walnuts which they had cracked for even-
ing, to see if here was enough, and then a basket
of rosy - cheeked apples, to see if they were the
right kind, until' the daylight began to fade, and
grandfather and grandmother mu t go home be-
fore it was gone,
Then evening came, the fires sent up fresh glows,
and reddened the white walls, and looked as cheery
as the children felt: Grace brought extra candles,
and drew up the chairs for Aunt Nannie and Aunt
Lois where her grandfather and grandmother had
.sat. Aunt Nannie thot ght they had better go

The rest of the week was a continued holiday.

the younger children-went to grandfather's to din-

and Grace were invited to the Thorn's. And
Aunt Nannie and Lois partook of a nice dinner at

of their own childhood'and youth. Saturday was
full of doing last things, to be ready for the im-

Annie smiled at Grace's earnestness; it seemed
as if she had grown suddenly thoughtful: She had
always been efficient, but had not yet learned to
bring this efficiency to uniform action. Now she
must have a definite time for study. If it was only
summer-time, and she could sit in the window
where she spun the flax,. she could secure plenty
of quiet. One thing she could do. Aunt. Nannie
always had a good fire. and a quiet corner; here
she could retreat at any time and be always wel-
come with only the buzz of the spinning-wheel to
interrupt her. Aunt Nannie'was rather doubtful
about the wisdom of going to school evenings; but
Ernest and Grace had got.it into their heads to
go, and she supposed there would be no stopping
them. So it was settled that Grace's chairshould
always be ready ii the corner fot cher whenever
she chose to take it.
It was Ernest who was to take the neighborhood
circle the first evening. Deacon Winthrop wished
to aid him as much as possible, so he harnessed

was made to hold six and could. accommodate

eight. The early tea was ready ; and. then with
father to help them off, the three boys leaning over
the fence to watch them, and mother, Annie and
Mary looking out of the window, he  drove off.
Grace's heart beat faster than it id when they
started for Boston. She actually felt more per-
sonal responsibility. They found the four belong-
ing to theirkcompany waiting to coe out, and
punctually at seven o'clock they, were seated in
Mrs. Lee's pleasant sitting-room. The whole twen-
ty were there. Doctor Allerton  et them with
an ease and cordiality which made them feel that
he was glad to see them. He had purchased the
books; and after these were talked over, he pro-
ceeded to arrange the classes, and in a familiar,
conversations way give various suggestions about
studying. Their work was so. laid out that on
Wednesday evening they could begi in earnest.
It was soon "next week," and he beginning
over, and then the skillfully-conducted classes
moved smoothly on with a steadily-growing inter-
est in their work. Doctor Allerton. as an excel-
lent instructor, and was fast gaining their respect.
He was beginning to be occupied professionally
too. His first case was one of surgery, which he
attended so successfully that it aforded him a
pleasant introduction to others. He had a case or
two of fever. The various pains an aches which
come and go wherever man abides, aimed his at.
tention enough to -make quite an important ent y
on his day-book. Occasionally he was absent from
his evening circle; then Ernest, at his and t-he pu-
pils' request, presided.

It was a winter long remembered by the young
people of Beechford. They had all varieties of
wind and weather ; but as no one had to be driver
all of the time, they did not mind it in their turns.
Sometimes when the sleighing was fine, and the
moon brought out the glorious frost-work in forms
of unspeakable beauty, we will not call them un-
scholarly if there *as some changing of seats, and
the ride home was  a few miles longer than usual.
Once, on such an evening, Doctor Allerton's sleigh
was standing at the door when they all came out.
He had some calls to make, and as he stood wait-
ing to see them off, Ernest playfully said, "Your
sleigh looks lonely, Doctor Allerton."
"I was just thinking so; perhaps you will lend
me a little cheer from yours. Miss Grace, I think
your brother will not accuse me of trespassing if I
ask you to change your seat in his sleigh for one
in mine."
The, proposition was so unexpected that Grace
hardly took it in before the doctor was extending
his hand to assist her out from the comfortable seat
where she was stowed away between Julia Thorn
and Edward Nelson. She knew the girls were
smiling at her discomfiture. A tete-a-tete ride with
Doctor Allerton in exchange-for the capital time
she was going to have with her boon companions !
He inspired her with respect. She always admired
him when he conversed with others; but if he ad
dressed her particularly, she usually answered him
in monosyllables, without any attempt to .prolong
the conversation. Now here she was actually rid-
ing alone with him. She hoped Ernest would go

home the shortest way, but instead.of that he turn.
ed the corner for a half hour's longer ride, and
Doctor Allerton turned the corner too.
"Will not this detain you from your patient,
Doctor Allerton ?" asked Grace.
" Oh ! no, I have plenty of time ; besides, 'I must
see your brother safe home."
Happily the doctor asked her some questions
about her visit at Boston; this put her quite at her
ease, and before she knew it she was talking and
he was listening. They were just behind Ernest
when he stopped to leave his first way passengers.
Doctor Allerton passed him with a cheerful good-
night, and reached Deacon Winthrop's just in ad-
vance of him.
Will you go in ?" said Grace, rather doubtfully,
as he held open the gate for her.
"Not-tonght, thank you ;" and he drove away
leaving her standing in the porch waiting for Er.
nest to come up.
After the horses were disposed of, Ernest joined
his sisters by the warm fire in the sitting-room.
Grace had been telling Annie of their evening les-
sons, but said nothing of her ride home. Ernest
looked very smiling as he poked the fire and drew
the brands closer together, and then he asked.
Grace how she liked the teacher out of school.
"Only think of it, Annie !" said he, "Grace ac-
tually rode home with so 'old and wise' a man as

home, to show him how much he appreciated it."
"Well, Grace, a man must have something be-
sides books and medicine, scholars and sick folks.
I don't knoW but Mrs. Allerton elect writes to him
every day, but he did look lonely to-night ; of
course I did not think of his asking you to ride
with him. You always look so demure when he is
around, I s would not think he would expect much
cheer from  ou. Did you discourse on the benefit
of pills and powders ?"
"Ernest, you are too bad; we did not talk about
medicine og, books either. I always imagined he
was bound up in both. Come to think of it, I be--
lieve I did most of the talking; but what did the
girls say to my sudden leave-taking?"
"Julia laughed heartily, but I don't believe Ned
Thorn liked it quite so well;.it took a good deal
of the fun out of him, On the front seat we got
along very nicely without you; only I kept think-
.ing what a colding I should get when I got home
for my innocent share in the matter; but if Doctor
Allerton only got you to talking, yoU enjoyed it, I

fire," said Annie; ".so you can go to bed as soon
as you like."
There was little time for idleness that whole win-
ter in the Winthrop household. Except to spend
a day with her grandmother. once a week, Grace
rarely went out. Her books, her household duties,
and her needle, kept her constantly busy. Meet-
ing the young circle to which she belonged three,
evenings in a week, and in their rides to and from
Mrs. Lee's, she found no lack of social pleasures.
She could always secure a quiet hour at Aunt
Nannie's fireside, when the busy sounds of home
were likely to trespass too. far on her attention.
Sometimes Aunt Lois would forget that "the
child" could not study and talk at the same time,
'but after awhile she held the .study hour quite sa-
cred, and kept all of her thoughts and questions to
herself, until it was over.
One morning, in February, Grace had taken her
books and her sewing and started to spend the day
with her grandmother. The clear, bracing air,
and the smooth, well-trodden snow made the walk-
ing very agreeable. She felt just like enjoying it.
The hills, and the trees, and the white-robed earth
never appeared to her n ore grandly beautiful than
on this winter morning. Out from her full heart
came the thought of whata beautiful world this is,
and how much there is in it to make one very
glad. She had been so absorbed in her own re-'.
flections that she had not even heard the sound of
sleigh-bells. The pleasant voice of Doctor Aller-
ton aroused her with a " Good morning, Miss
Grace."

",Why, Doctor Allerton! I did. not hear your
bells."
"I though t not," said he: " or else you intended
to make me tipset in this bank, in turning out for
you. I dro   quite slowly before  knew who it
was, hoping  should get my share of the road, at
least. You must allow me to keep you out of dan-
ger the res tof the way,"said he, stepping out of.
his sleigh a offering to help her in.
Grace th riked him. She did not care to ride.
She was only going to grandmother's, and needed
the exercise 6f walking.
"You can take that to-morrow," said he, still
holding out is hand to assist her. Grace took it,
and allowed im to seat her in his sleigh, wishing
in her heart hat she had walked 'faster and turned
the corner, little way beyond, before he overtook
her.
Doctor   lerton had just come from the bed-
side of a p  r suffering man, one whose "bed of
languishing' had no divine support. He had been
full of sad thoughts; and when that bright, glow-
ing face looked upon him so suddenly, he felt that
it was like carrying a sunbeam. To have it in his
sleigh for a little time would brighten the whole
.day. He hJ quickly discovered that Grace Win-
throp. wasn ordinary girl. Her recitations were
excellent. 'he comprehended things easily, and
was in her class, as everywhere else, a leading
spirit, yet she never seemed to know it. She was
so unselfish, 1oo ; the happiness of others was a&amp;p$'r
of her happy ness. Her ready, appreciating syii

right place. Her laugh was full of merriment.
Nothing escaped her quick perceptive faculties.
Doctor Allerton had observed her easy flow of
conversation with her companions, and had been
highly entertained at her remarks, when he was
not directly listening. To him she was always re-
served. If he called at her father's house, she
seemed to consider him as belonging to the elder
members of the family. The evening she rode
home with him from Mrs. Lee's was the first time
she ever really talked with him. His skill in-the
selection of a subject had drawn her out very suc-
cessfully, Since then her bow and smile had been
more kindly, but it was always as if their pathways
were in different directions. He had an instinctive
idea that if Charlie Thorn or Edward Nelson had
overtaken her this morning, she would have bound-
ed into either of their sleighs, almost without an
invitation, and chatted gayly the whole way. 'Why
did she take his offered seat so reluctantly?
"You seem to be a combination of occupations,"
said he. "Books and work-baskets are both rep-
resented."
" Oh, yes," said she; "time is very precious
now. I must work when I visit, or else not visit
at all. Cousin Laura asked me if w e did not get.

think if she could see how this.winter is passing,.

hours with iy class are very pl asant to me. I
am afraid I  fight get dull, as y ur Cousin Laura
expresses it, if I did not meet so many cheerful
faces."
"Don't you like the country ?"
"Yes ; butthis beginning life among;strangers,
with all the anxieties attending my profession,
is often depressing. I have been to see a patient
this morning who ought to be better, but he is
not; he need a little of your cheerful spirit to tone
up his system."
Grace looked up astonished. Here was Doctor
Allerton talk ng to her j st as Ernest would have
done. He was not all hooks and medicine'then !
and he was lonesome and discouraged sometimes
just like other people. She had never thoughtyif
him in this light before, and a touch of something,
akin to symp thy filled her heart for him It wvas
not exactly lke riding with Doctor Stanhope, after
all,and her manner was more free and cordialtlhan
it had ever been before with him.
He left her at her grandfather's. The cheerfTul
old man was standing at his gate as they drove up.
He saluted the doctor very cordially, and expressed
his satisfaction that he had so much to do. Doc-
tor Allerton declined his invitation to go in, and
drove ~away, cheered by the little interview he had
had with Grace Winthrop.
"Riding out with Doctor. Allerton, this fine
morning, eh, Grage !" said her grandfather, as he
poked the  re and sent the sparks fl ing up the
wide chimney.
" He over ook me, grandfather, and asked me.

to ride; so I could not very well help it, you
see."
"Need n't help it, child ! it is alwaysbetter to
ride than it is to walk, when you can just as well as
not. Doctor Allerton is a young man of great
promise, I think. Did you hear him say how Mr.
Fleming is this morning ?"
"Not any better, I believe."
"I'm afraid he won't be, poor man. It's my
opinion that his mind is more in fault than his body.
He's very fretful, they say. It's a dreadful thing
to be old, without an interest in Jesus Christ. I
remember talking with Fleming some years ago.
He told me there was plenty of time to look after
another world when sickness and old age gave a
person nothing else to do, and now he is finding
out his great mistake. His great mistake !" said
the old man, musingly; "his 'want has come like
an armed man,' and there is nothing to supply it.
'Cast me not off in the time of old age, forsake me
not when my strength faileth."' He held his hands
to the blaze, and seemed lost in his own tl oughts.
Old age had come upon him like a finishin. touch,
mellowing his heart, and making him ready for the
harvest.
Grace looked at his time-worn face and thought
there was something beautiful in its calm repose.
Now she began telling her grandmother of the
little home incidents ,she always loved to hear,
until, warned by the clock, she gathered up her
books. " I will study awhile," said she, untill it
is time to help you get dinner, grandmother."
" No, child, I can get dinner without you as well

to-day as yesterday. Attend to your lessons, be+
fore anybody comes in to'interrupt you."
So, in the. quiet of her grandmother's kitchen,
she got possession of the remainder of her lesso s,
and was ready for dinner ,and its after duti s.
While her grandmother slept "just fifteen minute,
and her grandfather dozed in his armed-chair, she
sewed and thought over the lessons she had been
learning.
These quiet days were feasts to Grace. From
her earliest childhood she had been often at her
grandmother's; sometimes staying weeks at a time.
As she grew older, she loved to listen to, the 4lsl
lady's stories of her own childhood and youth.
She almost fancied she was acquainted with 1he
young people of her day. She knew all about her
grandmother's two young sisters, who died of con-
sumption, before they were twenty. years old. She
sympathized in her loneliness after they were gone,
and was always glad that she found such a dear,
good companion as grandfather to cheer and com-
fort her. Unconsciously this dear grandmother
wove many an enduring truth into the woof of he
young girl' life, which time brought out ith
astonishing vividness. The fifteen minutes nap
extended into half an hour, and then,'with  er
clean cap and apron, grandmother took her eat
by the south window, and, with her knitting-sheath
adjusted, was ready to give-the. bright needles a
chance to work. "I'm getting behind with  y
knitting,". said she ; "the boys wear out their
stockings so fast, that it will take us all to keep up
with them. I don't know what your mother would

father, roused from his pleasant nap by t
of his wife's voice, arid comprehending

as good a woman as your mother and grar

The short afternoon soon wore away

SUMMER DAYS.
TpIME has a way of hastening on, carrying days,
weeks and months along with it. Just as you
think you are nicely settled for winter, the pro-
gramme of spring is before you, and you must lay
aside what for the moment seemed a permanent
way of living and take up something iew.
Before our friends were half ready for them, the
blue birds came and told, in sweet warbling strains,
that winter was over, and with-it Doctor Allerton's
school. It was a regretful parting. for all of them;
they had enjoyed it, and felt that it had done them
all good. Doctor Allerton was regarded as a fixture
now. He had treated his cases with skill, and had
gained the confidence of all whohad employed-
him. He took an active interest in church matters,
and was regarded by Mr. Wilson as 4 great addi-
tion to the town. He had become well acquainted
with the young people. His cultivated mindhav-
ing been brought to bear so directly upon them,

find the family quite frightened about little Mary,
who had come from school with a .violent head-
ache, and was now so dull and sleepy that her moth-
er's practiced eye discerned symptoms of illness
which demanded immediate attention. Aunt Lois
had been there all the afternoon, but her usual
remedies had failed. She roused at hearing Grace's
voice, but it was only momentary, she was too
sleepy to respond to her inquiries.
"We must send for the doctor right away," said
'Mrs. Winthrop.
"I shall go for Doctor Allerton," sail Ernest.
"No," said his mother, "Doctor Stanhope has
been our faithful friend ever since I can remember.
It would be very ungrateful to leave him now for
a new one."
"He is very feeble. :I saw him yesterday, and
he looked as if he needed a 'doctor himself," said
Ernest.
"Well, I shall not forsake old friends for new.
If you were sick, you could have who you chose.
You must go for Doctor Stanhope first, and if he is
not able to come, of course you must go for Doctor
Allerton."
Ernest was not long in finding Doctor Stanhope,
too ill to attend to a patient, and Doctor Allerton at
his office ready to accompany him. He was soon
at the child's bedside, administering such remedies
as her symptoms demanded.
For nearly a week little Mary was very -ill, then
her disease began to yield, leaving her feeble and
very dependent on good n rsing for her recovery.

Aunt Lois had been invaluable in her aid to Mrs.
Winthrop and Annie during the doubtf1 days;
but as the child grew better, she was left for Grace
to nurse and amuse..
I was July now. Grace would bring hr sister
into the porch, and soothe and divert her in vari-
ous ways. She grew stronger daily. Doctor llerton
no longer came professionally, but he ofte found
it convenient to drop in when Mary was comforta-
bly seated in the armed chair, which was rought
into the porch for her use, with her doll and its
wardrobe on one side, and Grace and' the nend-
ing-basket on the other. He always had scme en-
tertaining story for the little invalid, making her
quite; forget her doll and her  earjness, and Jausing
Grace to wonder how a man who knew so much
of books could tell a child's story so p ettily.
These visits seemed all for Mary, and she looked
for his coming with great eagerness. Sh4 even
knew the sound of his horse's footsteps before he
came in sight.
Was it the shadowy coolness of the old eln,; was
it the:deep interest he took in his fast conval scing
patient,;or was it the bright, fair face he  as so
sure to find a this hour attending the littl girl,
that made him call so often ? No matter which, ome-
thing made Doctor Allerton very attentive.  ary
was such a pet in the household, that it was very
easy to believe that anybody would take great
pains to make her happy  but it came to an end.
Mary was well again, and ran merrily abott en-
tertaining herself. Grace went back to her hare
of domestic duties, and I5octor Allerton called oc.

casionally, as a friend of the whole family,.though
Mary claimed him as her special property.
The harvest days ca e, and seemed very like the
harvest days of the last yar. The old porch was
again the family meeti g place at evening. A nd
sometimes Ernest and Grace discussed the possi-
bility of their uncle's coming in September.
" Shall be glad to see him if he comes," said
Deacon Winthrop, "but I hardly expect him.'
Grace wondered if they would want her to go
back with them. She was very doubtful of her
own desire to do so, even if her father and mother
shouldbe willing. It was to her -a peculiarly pleas-
ant summer, she was busy and happy at. home.
And after harvest, 'Ernest, Charlie Thorn and Ed-
ward Nelson, got up such delightful berry parties
and horseback excursions and rides to the lake,
that she could .hardly tell where the days went,
they glided along so full of work and play. ,She
was at home on horseback. Caesar was her favor-
ite for riding, she could gallop over the hills with
Ernest, Charlie Thorn, or Edward Nelson, and not
tire any .sooner than ,they. Her life was such a
freedom from care, such a mingling of childhood
and womanhood. Of course there were vexations
and perplexities in her daily path, but they were
such as 'ended with the passing event.
"Grace !" said her mother, .one day, "how lit-
tle you knob what life really is.'
"Sevente'n years old and not. realize what .life
is ! Why, m ther ! how strangely you talk."
"1 suppose I do to' you, my child ;" and Mrs.

By this time Grace had come out to welcome
her uncle followed by her mother a d Annie. The
children meanwhile suddenly disappeared into their
mother's bed-room,- leaving a crack of the door'
open, so that they could get a clear idea of what
was going.on. The carriage no  came up. On
hearing it Charles and Henry jumped out of the
window and ran into the garden to get a bet-
ter view through the fence. It was truly a rare
sight that cartage, and those horses. And when
their uncle opened a door in the carriage, and let
down some stairs, arid ,gave his hand to two such
finely dressed ladies to come out, they were ready
to believe that Cinderella and her coach had really,
come.
Mrs. Winthrdp nd Laura met Grace as if they
had kno n he   always, and were very cordial to
her mothr and sister.

little of country life. Colonel Wintirop had given
them no idea of his early home; understanding
him as they did, they knew his heart was both glad

very dear spott, and they must resect and honor
it, however plain and homely it might seem to
them. Grace. 4as a little embarrassed at first. She

way what my errand is."
What Grace told her brother, or what her errand
was at her grandmother's, we will not stay to hear.
When tea was ready in the sitting-room, and Mrs.
Winthrop began to fill the cups, she discovered
her mother's hina was on the tray before her, and
an unusual number of.silver spoons were at her
service. She smiled to herself and remembered
that Grace had been mis ing just when she wanted

they were intensely interested in watching all that
went on.
"You know our errand, sister," said Colonel

throp; "even this tallow-candle seems to flicker al
sort. of welcogie."
After theiriguests had retired, Grace assisted her
mother in some preparations for breakfast, and
then had a little chat with Annie. She was anx-
ious to know what impression her aunt and cousin)
had made. Annie never made up her mind hastily.
She liked them very well, especially Laura. She:
wanted to. see more of her aunt before she could;
tell what she thought of her. The next day was
very beautiful. Colonel Winthrop spent the morn-
ing in wand ring over familiar spots, and in the
afternoon,, accompanied by his. wife and daughter,
Ernest and Annie, he started for a ramble about
the farm. Laura was delighted with the beautiful
views. MrsJ Winthrop managed to get up all the
interest she could, but she soon tired of walking
and climbing stone fences. Ernest went back with
her to a path which led to the house, and she came
up to the porch and seated herself very gladly fobl
a talk with little Mary, who was alone there play-
ing with a pair of frolicksome kittens. .  n
Mary was very much pleased with "the new
lady," as she called her aunt. She grew very con-
fiding and told her that she was goings to have
some of the ''beautifulest" cake for tea that she ever
saw. Grace was making it now, and she was "put-
ting sugar all over the top;" then she thanked her
for the pretty dress she sent her when.Grace went
to Bostonandtold her items of household doings
which greatly,amused her.

Mrs. Colonel Winthrop was taking a new view,
of life; it seemed to her so, impossible that this
large family could go on so quietly without the aid
of servants. She did not even see that their pres,
ence caused extra labor. They helped each other,
and everything seemed to go on so harmoniously.
It was a new style of life, and its .novelty pleased'
her.
Just before sunset Colonel Winthrop appeared
he had taken a different route from  rest and the
girls.
"I am more changed than the old arm," said he
to his wife. ' I have had a sad enjoyment all the
afternoon. I wonder I could be content to stay
away from the _old place so long. .'Look at that
sunset! it is just such as I used to witch from this
very place. I can almost hear mother's voice call-
ing me to do some forgotten thing. e boys liked'
play, and mother's hands were ver busy at this
hour." Again the boy stood in th man's place,.
and Mrs. Winthrop was silent.
Annie and Laura soon came. Ernest had left
them at the gate and gone to attend to his evening
tasks. Laural was glowing in her description of
her ramble. Her mother called her attention to
her torn dress as a testimony of some of the incon-
veniences attending the. way.
"Never mind that, mother ! the rock I climbed
was worth more than my dress. I was the one;
where father used to call the sheep to give them
salt., The top of it is broad and flat like a table..
To-morrow, Ernest is going to take us to ride in:
the wagon. I shall enjoy that, I know."

father used to; but my recollection of toil and
hardship is so much more in the army than on the
farm, that I never think of farm life with any feel-
ing but rest and enjoyment."
''Not much rest," said Ernest; ' for nothing:
stays as you leave it. The weeds and briars keep
up a constant strife with the corn and otatoes, and
in the garden the work is never done."
" I have not come to the restingpla:e yet," said
Deacon Winthrop; " but I suppose he world is
alike all over ; it was intended to be 4 busy place,
and, if we are good for any thing, we niust all have
our share in its labors."
By and by Col. Winthrop led the co versation to
the subject of Grace's going home with them.
" We shall not be content to go back without her,"
said he, "unless there are positive obje tions to her
going."
"Don't you know, Brother Edward," said Mrs.
Winthrop, "that she cannot dress as aura does,
and that it would ,be impossible for her father to
increase his expenses ?"
"I. know it perfectly well; and, if I take her, it
shall be at my own expense. Laura wants a com-
panion. Her aunt is very anxious t have her,'
and to me she will be a link from the old place."
"How long do you mean to keep he ?"
"I will not .promise to bring her back under a
year, unless some of you are sick and really need
her. I do not mean to rob you' of G ace, sister;
though I would gladly .adopt her. Oily promise
she may stay a year with us, and then be guided
by circumstances afterward."

said she. "I should think the young ladies here
would enjoy his society.".
"He does not seek ladies' society," said Ernest.
" We have an idea that he has an interest outside
of Beechford."
"1 think the girls are a little afraid of him," said
Grace. "He is always polite, but he seems so far
off.''
"That is your opinion," said Ernest. f'The
truth is, Cousin Laura, Grace likes to have a good
time, and manages to find plenty to jdin her.
Here are Charlie Thorn and Edward      elson,
always ready to do whatever she says, and he rest
follow. Doctor Allerton strikes out his o n path.
She regards him as quite too 'old and wise for her
notice."
Grace laughed, and said, "Ernest Winthrop had
a path of his own as well as Doctor Allerton; at
least the girls thought so. She was sure they
could never manage him, if she was gone; but, for
all that, he is one of the best brothers in the orld,"
and she laid her head caressingly on his shoulder,
and was half a mind not to go'away and leave him.
Sunday, Deacon and Mrs. Winthrop rod in the
carriage with their brother and sister, littl Mary
accompanying them ; while Laura rode in the
wagon with the family. Such an establishment
had never come up to the village-green before, and
we must not think it strange that many ey s were
directed to it. Its owner was thinking  ore of
the faces that were gone, and enjoying th shake
of the' few friendly hands that were left t greet
him, than of the sensation his carriage was making.

If they had not been determined to car
off, the old ladies would have considered

Laura took them to ride in her father's

She wen alone to her grandfather's and staid
with the ol people to an early tea.
"Remember, my child !" said her grandmother,
at par ing, ' your Bible and your prayers. I may
be go e w en you come again, but I would have
this t oug t abide with you always. Unless you
love tM Lord Jesus Christ and serve Him above every-
thing ise, our life will be a failure.  May He
'keep you from temptation and deliver you from
evil.'"
" Ycur grandmother's words are good, my child,"
said her grandfather; "and I will add to them,
'Be not wise in thine own eyes ; fear the Lord and
depar from evil,' and 'the Lord shall guide thee
contin ally. "-
Grace was weeping now, and with one, more
farewell from these faithful sentinels of 'her child-
hood and youth, she. went on her way. Once she
turned back to look, and there they stood. watch-
ing her out of sight.
There were two ways home--one by the usual
road, and an other more retired, where they walked
or rode on horseback ; it was once the highway, but

had been so ittle used since the shorter road was
made that it had growh impassable for wheels.
She chose this latter path, that she might have
time to compose herself without much  anger of
meeting anybody. She had gone about half-way,
-and was trying to look at the bright side of things,
determining that her last evening at home should
be a cheerful one, when the was aroused by the
sound of horse's feet coming in the path behind
her. Who could it be? Her first impulse was to
wait behind a tree until the rider passed, but be-
fore she had time to get out of sight the horse was
beside her and its rider had dismounted.
Her eyes were so swollen and so red from the
tears she had.. been shedding that she di not look
up until a pleasant voice said, "Is it possible that I
find you here, Miss Grace ?"
"Doctor Allerton !" said she, in equal astonish-
ment, "who would have thought of meeting you
here?  I did not lknow that you ever ame this
way."
"I have learned all the traveled path of your
town. I was going to your house, and, for con-
venience, came across here. Most fortunately, I
think, since I have overtaken you in it. Is it"
really true, Miss Grace,. that you are going to
leave us ?'.
" I suppose so. I have just been to bid grand-
father and grandmother good-bye, I did not think'
it would be so hard to leave them." .
"And are they the only ones you regret to
leave-?"
" Oh, no ! I -have so: many friends that I won-

der I can go at all." And she choked back the
tears that were ready to start again.
"Did it ever!occur-to you," said her companion,
gently detaining her, "that anybody outside of
your imr mediate home circle might deeply regret
your uncle's invitation ?."
"Yes, the girls all do. It has been a great trial
to part with them."
"Grace Winthrop !" said Doctor Allerton, tak-
ing her hand, "you must pardon my abruptness,
and, listen while I tell.you something which, but
for your going I should have kept longer to tmyselt
and revealed at a moie fitting time. I hoped, as
we saw more of each other, you would understand
my feelings towards you, for I have learned to love
you very much, and to hope that sometime in the
future yo will return my love, and-consent to be-
come my wife."
Had any earthquake uddenly rent the ground at
the young girl's feet, she could not have been more
utterly astonished. S e had been so full of happi-
ness, had had so many to love,.and so much to inter-
est and occupy her, th t she had had little room
to dream of what mig t be. When she got to it,
possibly she might marry, but not for years and
years.i She was not uite eighteen, only a dear,
home child, and Doctor Allerton, of all persons,

older and so much wiser that, she never thought
he self a companion for him. What could have
pu such a thought intc his head! Had she heard
aright ? Yes, she had, or it was very plainly said,

I wanted to see you young doctor again," said
Colonel Winthrop. "I thought he might happen
in to tea."
"I did not know but e might be here when we
got home," said Mrs. W nthrop,-"has he been here
this afternoon, Charles ?"
Charles having been left ii capacity of liouse-
keeper, quickly responded.  No, ma'am, and
Mrs. Winthrop surmise that he would probably
call in the evening.
Grace felt the blood rush to her face at the very
mention of his' name.  he turned to speak to her
little sister, though she scarcely knew what she
asked her. Mary was a good covert, for she was
too frill of the grandeur of her ride in ",that beau-
tiful carriage," to hear a word her sister said.
Doctor Allerton did call at evening, and was
to all appearance quite absorbed in conversation
with their guests. Several of Grace's most inti-
mate friends came too. So she had enough to do
to talk to them all. S-e did not once speak to
Doctor Allerton, but sh felt 'his- presence every-
where. She was more grave than usual, but that
was easily accounted for in the jct that she, was
leaving so much that she loved. To have a some-

life-long confidant Julia Thorn, was oppressive, some.

and- did not wake until the, sun was shadowing the

Things look to us so differently by daylight, es-
pecially when there is something to'fill out every
moment of our time, even her interview with Doc-
tor Allerton involved less than her midnight view
of it presented. She had only promised to answer
his letters. After all he might not write.. If he
did he would soon tire of it, and she should not
have to see him again until she had forgotten what
he said. She went down stairs, determining to be
very cheerful, and assist as usual in the breakfast
duties, but Charles had entered the service before
her.
"Mother says'I must try and fill your place,"
said he; " but should not wonder if I should be
missing a good .many times this winter just when
she wants the table set, boys are so unrelia le, you
know," and he gave his sister a wise, comprehen-
sive nod. "I suppose she will not expect me to
sew, and do all the family things you do. I won-
der what sort of a cap I should make for grand-
mother, or how Annie would like the way I should

CHAPTER- XIII.
THE JOURNEY.
rP.HE journey to New York had variety in scen-
ery and in people. Sometimes when Laura
and Grice were tired of riding, they walked for a
mile, stoppino- to admire the fine views. Every-
thing was different from the journey which Ernest
and Grace took the year before, no wayside din-
ners or friendly cou ins were in this.
Colonel Winthrok .never went beyond a certain
degree of familiarity, and his excessive punctuality
made no allowances for any waiting on the part of
his family. Mrs. Winthrop often said she had to
live half an hour ahead to keep time with her. htis
band, and Laura was fast learning this half hour
principle. Grace did not anticipate much trouble
from this point in her uncle's character, she had-
never been in the habit of k eping people waiting.
At length they reached N, w York. New York
fifty years ago! .Where are the hotels and places
of note to-day, which were so conspicuous then?
Where are the old forest rees that were then
strong undisputed possessors of even the "down
town" of to-day ? Who could have foretold that the
on-marching tide of life and ctivity would in fifty

years uproot them all, and plant in their places
broad 'venues and princely d ellings, with the
ever-ircreasing' demand for "more room, more
room." Well! New York met all the necessities
of the country then and it on y doe's that now.
Probably in another fifty years he wonder will be
how we ever called it "'a gre t city." Colonel.
Winthrop knew where to find he best accommo-
dations the city afforded, and having established
his family quite to his mind, he left them to enjoy
themselves for the rest of the da in their own .way.
Grac's perceptive faculties vere on the alert
now, for everything was strange and new. She
felt more lonely than she had one since leaving
home, and was glad when she a d Laura could go
to their room and be themselves again. Her trunk
looked like an old friend. She pened and shut it
with special satisfaction, and almost felt like pat-
ting its unpretending surface.
" Cone, Grace," said Laura, "you have done all
homage to that trunk. I wish  o'h would leave it
and sit in this window with  e and look at the
people and the fashions; that's t e way when you'

joyable to live over again. Mrs. Oakley was talking
with Mrs. Winthrop, but her eye often wandered
to the merry group where her sons vere.
"I have a very happy thought, Mrs. Winthrop,"
said she. " I wish you would leave these two young
ladies with me a couple of months. I think I could
make it very pleasant for them."
" Thank you," replied Mrs. Wint rop. "I have
no doubt of the pleasure they would have, but Colo-
nel Winthrop would not consent to that; heis fond
of having young people in the house. Laura has
been away at school a great deal, and his niece is
a prize too hard to obtain to part with so soon."
" I am afraid you are making-Colonel Winthrop
your shield," said Mrs. Oakley, laughing. "Will
you consent to it if he does ?";
"I am so sure that he will not, that it is quite
safe to say yes."
"Here he comes " said Mrs. Oakley. "I will
see what his unbiassed opinion is.  o you know,
colonel, that I am strongly dispose to keep these
young ladies for a couple of months, and giVe them
some idea of New Y rk ? You Bostonians are not
half aware of our superior advantages."
"Don't forget that you are a Bostonian yourself,
Mrs. Oakley !"
I'll promise not to, if you will leave these girls
with me ; it is just he season for enjoyment, and
I shall be most happy to chaperone them."

them now, our journey is not yet. completed.- I
propose to start for Philadelphia to-morrow."
"Oh, you had not told us that !" said Mrs. Oak-
ley; "then you can leave them on your return."
"Thank you; it will be impossible. I like young
people in the house in the winter."
Mrs. Oakley understood Colonel Winthrop's "im-
possible " so well, that she did not press the sub-
ject any farther, and shortly after her guests took
their leave.
On their way home Laura asked her father "if
their going to:Philadelphia was not sudden."
".No," said h ; "I thought of it before we came
from home. I did not tell your mother until we
got to New York, for my mind was not fully made
up. I did not like to drive my horses on so long
a journey, and unless I could hire a pair that suited
me, and leave mine in good care to rest, I did not
expect to go. I have found a pair to-day,-.and a
driver, so I shall leave John to take care of mine,
and they will be fresh for starting when we come
back. I suppose you and Grace will not object to
seeing a little more of the world, even if the an-
nouncement was sudden."
"I shall enjoy it doubly for having Grace, and I
have long been wanting to go to.Philadelphia."
"New York and Philadelphia !" thought Grace,
as she leaned back. in the carriage and thought.
"I suppose Iram Grace Winthrop, but I almost doubt
it." The poor girl had had a succession of  doubts
ever since she .met. Doctor Allerton on her way
home from hex grandfather's. The rapid succes-
sion ofevents since then had somewhat diverted

her thoughts from the scene, but now and then it
came up very forcibly. On reaching the hotel the
girls went directly to their room, and after laying
aside their. shawls, they sat down to talk.
"Were you not surprised to hear we were going
to Philadelphia to-morrow ?" asked Grace.
"Yes ; but father likes to surprise us by some
plan he thinks out and expects us to enjoy. It is
very pleasant this time, surely. You don't know
how much more I enjoy this journey for having
you along ; I am always so lonely in my room at a
hotel. I even enjoy d the dinner at Mrs. Oakley's
to-day better for hating you there. I was think-
ing when you sat so quietly dignified at the table,
how thoroughly yo'9 were taking in every thing
around you. What a happy thought it was for
you to come to Boston ! It will be such a pleasure
to me this winter to have some one to enjoy things
with me. I know now how lonely I have been.
I felt it more when I saw how much you all loved
each other at your house, and how many ways you
had of being happy without riches. But I am run-
ning on about myself, without asking you how you
like New York dinner-parties."
"I got through this one a great deal better than
I expected to. I was so entertained with the
novelty that I forget to be embarrassed. I .never
once thought about my ncw silk dress."
"I thought you did not," said Laura, .smiling.
"Iow did you like Mrs. Oakley's proposal ?"
"I had better reply by.asking how you'liked it,
for I am so bewildered with New York, Philadel.
phia and Boston, that Iyam sure I cannot' tell."

FIFTY YEARS AGO.

"I knew father would not listed. to it; in the first
place, he would not leave us anywhere ;- and in the
next place, he does not like Robert Oakley. ,It is one
of his unaccountable dislikes. When they lived in
Boston he fancied he was too attentive to his daugh-
ter. We were very young, and father seemed pos-
sessed with the idea that I should be snatched away
from him before he was ready to let me .go. He
and mother are great friends. of Mr.. and Mrs.
Oakley, and he never speaks-of Robert now. I

he will not leave us to. visit with, Mrs. Oakley.
Mother told re to come to her - room," said
she, suddenly starting up. "Be sure you do
not run away if I leave you alone a 'few mo.
ments."
Mrs. Winthyop was lying down after the fatigues
of the day.  he only wished to.tell,Laura to send
everything to her room that she and Grace could
do without on their trip to Philadelphia, as her
father desired as little baggage as possible, and to
tell her that she should not go down tothe parlor
again this evening ; so, of course, she. and Grace
need not.
"Crace may. send her black silk dress- to my

the morning. Your father says we must leave by
ten o'clock."
Punctually at ten o'clock Colonel Winthrop's
carriage, with its new horses. and driver, stood at
the door of their hotel, and his family were soon
in it driving towards Philadelphia.
It was now the second week in October, the
weather was fine, an 1 in due time, by easy stages,
they reached Philadelphia.
" What a contrast to Boston !" said Laura, as
they, drove through its regular streets. "I am so
used to going crooked at home, that I really be-
lieve I should lose myself in this-good order."
Here, as in New York, Grace gathered up every
thing of interest.
"How shall I ever keep so much to tell them at
home," sai she to Laura one day; "letters are so
poor to cairy the half I have to tell."
"You must see the old State House, where that
glorious Declaration was read," said. Colonel Win-.
throp the first morni g after their arrival; and to
the State House tlhey went. They visited the
library which Franklin's public spirit founded ; the
Athenaum, the Academy of Fine Arts, and- he
United States Mint.
Colonel Winthrop was intensely national; he
looked upon these foundations of future improve-
ment, as foretastes of the country's growth in peace
and prosperity. In its days of darkness and peril
he had fought for its welfare, and now its omens
of future life and g eatness filled him with rejoic-

I shall think my sun1y cousin has a shadow some-

Grace did smile, end drop the thought which
Laura's remark had brought to light.
Just then Mrs. Winthrop came in to tell Laura
her father thought that she had made so many
purchases, that it wpuld be necessary to get an
extra trunk for packing, and send it by the mail-
coach to Boston.
" So you must send all that you and Grace can
do without to my room as soon as possible."
While Laura was packing, Grace wrote to An-
nie. She had only sent one letter home since she
left, and had not heard a word from them.. She
expected to find a letter waiting for her when she
reached Boston. The horses were fresh and strong
to undertake the journey, and.John had them in
readiness for their homeward trip the next morn-
ing at an early hour.
November is fitful, and if she beams softly through
hazy vapors on her "opening days," she may sweep
away every vestige of such moods in one of her
gustful attacks. Colonel Winthrop made no un-'
necessary delays, driving as far each day as he
could, with safety to the horses. Two or three
days of rain were the only interruptions they
had.

Doctor Allerton looked less iormidable than he had
ever done before, and for the first time she thought
of his letters as a source of unexpected pleasure.
Her heart was aching to ask if there were any letters
waiting for her; but there was so much bustle and
inquiry after this and that, that she did not venture
to mention it.
" I am tired and hungry," said Laura, coming in
from a general survey of the house, and throwing
herself on the bed. "After dinner 1 expect to
sleep until to-morrow morning, if I can, and then
we will begin housekeeping. Such a cleaning of
drawers and closets as I expect to make ! You.
shall have your share of'all the conyniences,' as
Mrs. Clark says.
" Do you keep a fire here all of the time ?"
"Yes, always.. Ralph fills that box :wice every
day, and Mrs. Clark looks after the fire when I am
out. This fire has been my special companion. I
shall not be on half as social terms with it, now that
I have you to talk to. .I'm so glad to see you sit-
ting in that chair, Grace Winthrop, that I do not
believe I shall ever let you go away. Come to
this window," said she, rising up and going to it.
"See what a beautiful view we have ! I have
watched all of these surroundings so ong, that I
feel as if they were my especial friends.'
It was rather a chill November day, and people
w ere hurrying along as if increased  peed were
necessary to keep up a brisk circulation. Grace
tried to think how it would look under a sunny
sky, and Laura was satisfied that she would admire.
it sufficiently by and by.,

FIFTY YEARS AGO.

There was a knock at the door, and Mrs. Clark
appeared, holding up a letter. "It came for you
three days ago Miss Grace. I forgot to give it:to
you as soon a you got here, though I kept it by
itself on purpose."
"A letter !" and Grace's face lit up so beamingly
that Laura called it very beautiful.
"Oh! thank you, Mrs. Clark. It is the very
thing I wanted.. Annie !" she exclaimed, and dance
round the room in very joy.
"Good-bye," said Laura. "Don't fly out of th
window and go to Beechford, while I am gone,'
and in a moment Grace was alone. She opened
the dear letter and read, and-read, and laughed,
and cried. It was the first sound from home for
six weeks. There were messages from, every one
of them,.and little items of news. They had missed
her so much! Mother had no idea of how many
steps she saved her.' Ernest said the house was
lonely from top to bottom, and the children were
always in trouble about -something which would
not be so if-Grace were here. "Father and I make
the best of it," wrote Annie. "If we did not, I
think you would see the whole family, with Aunt
Nannie and. Aunt Lois, in close pursuit of you.
Aunt Lois says, 'It's a-foolish piece of business to
let young gals go off with their fine relations, but
folks must do as they are a-mind to with their
own.' Mother says, 'Remember your uncle's kind-.
ness, and repay him by your dutiful attention to
his wishes.'

aloud. 'Why did I come ?" Then the thought

CHAPTER            XIV.
THE NEW HOME.
HEN Grace opened her eyes the next morn-.
te fing, Mrs. Clark had been in and lighted
the fire. Sl ei had thrown open the blinds and let
the sun in through the curtains. The room had a
very cheerful aspect, and there, in the corner, was
. her trunk, the most attractive thing on which her
eye rested. She got up quietly, not intending to
waken Laura, but in a few moments she sprang. up,
exclaiming, "Grace! where are you? I was just
dreaming that I got up and could not find you any-
where. Father and mother were looking and call-
ing, and finally somebody told us that Annie sent
for you in that letter, and you had gone home. I
was so grieved and indignant that it woke me, and
when I saw your place empty, I did not know but
you had gone."
"No, I anm not quite so uncertain in my move-
ments as th t," said Grace; "I shall take daylight,
when I run away."
" When did Mrs. Clark open these blinds? That
is always  y signal for rising. I do not suppose
breakfast w 11 be one minute later, for all the long
ride we have taken. I have no doubt father has

been out on horseback a full hour this morning I
don't believe he was ever tired in his life."
" I was wondering how you ever knew wh n it
was time to get up. At home, the children are
always awake so early that I depend on them."
"You, will find Mrs. Clark equal to a host of chil-
dren. She never gives me any peace when she
thinks it really time for me to get up. She always
.lets in the sun as soon as the fire is kindled."
As soon as the girls had completed their morn-
ing toilette, Laura proposed they should go down
stairs. "Father always comes into the back parlor,
after his ride, and he .considers it a great omission
if I am not there."
Colonel Winthrop looked quite satisfied when
he saw the two girls waiting to receive his good-
morning. The keen, frosty air had given a glow
of health and cheerfulness to his face, and his smile
was most gracious as he remarked on the benefits
of the morning air. "If you want to keep young
and vigorous," said he, "never lie in bed in the
morning."
Grace remembered that she had always been ac-
quainted with this same morning air, and she
thoughtof it at that moment reddening the cheeks
of her young, healthy brothers as they were about
their morning tasks.
When Mrs. Winthrop came-down, breakfast was
served, the coffee came steaming from a massive
silver urn, and Grace was again reminded of her

in daily use there, that it did not lose one particle
of its dignity in her estimation.
CoJonel Winthrop never made haste over break-
fast, dinner o tea; his time was. so much at his
disposal that he could arrange its expenditure to
suit his own convenience.  Grace. was. so much
accustomed to dispatch, particularl-y in the morn-
ing, that she could hardly feel content to sit so
long only for breakfast.
This ended, Laura sat down to hear how the
piano sounded after its long silence. Grace was a
very ready listener; but Laura, after playing a few
times, said, ." Come, Grace, we must proceed to
business. . Don't expect to see us again until din-
ner, mother," said she, as she went gaily up-stairs.
"Unless I tell you that'my trunk from New York
has arrived, and you want some of the things that
are in it."
'-' That, of course, might induce us out of our
retreat.  ut has it come ?"
"Yes, it as here before we were, but you must
not come down at present. I 'am too tired to open
it. I am going to get rested before I do any--
thing."
Mrs. Clark :had put the room in oruer while the
young ladies were down -stairs. Two easy- chairs
were drawn cozily up before the fire, and the
whole room had a most inviting aspect..
" No use for easy -chairs this morning," said
Laura. "We must get ready to live first."
It did, indeed, prove a very busy morning.
Bureau drawers were emptied and re-arranged,
and plenty of room made .for Grace... Summer

apparel was packed away and winter things un-
packed and brought out. Grace had no longer any
use for her. trunk, so she regretfully saw it put away
ip a store-room in the attic.
At last, everything had a place-the easy-chairs
were one at each window, a table standing between
them. Laura had produced a' basket well sup-
plied with sewing materials, which she placed on
Grace's side of the table.
"You see I knew the habits of your busy
fingers," said she, "and here is amusement for
them."
The morning had gone so fast, that, before they
knew it, dinner-time came.
Grace had read over her letter from home, but
she had been so interested in her busy morning
that she had not felt the dreadful homesick feeling
which so troubled her the afternoon before.
At dinner, Colonel Winthrop said the horses
were too tired to go out to-day, so they would dis-
pense with their ride if Mrs. Winthrop felt so dis-
posed.
" I am too tired myself," said she. "I feel as if
I had had riding enough to last for a long time,
and shall esteem it quite a privilege to stay in the
house. The girls can walk if they reed exer-
cise."
"We are something like you, mother too tired.
to need.it. -.Besides, we have seen so much lately,
we prefer quiet and rest for a day or two."
After dinner, the girls went with Mrs. Winthrop
to her room to examine the contents of the trunk.
Grace found that a beautiful blue cashmere dress'

J

and sundry collars, handkerchiefs and ribbons had
someway got in there for her. Laura had ascrim-
son cashmere to match the blue one.
"My brurtte and my blonde," said Mrs. Win-
throp, "are represented in these two dresses."
Grace adinired her's very much; and, as she
passed her hand over the soft material, she asked
her aunt if she could not cut and make it herself.
"No, child, you want it at once ; Laura's dress-
maker will do it."
"I wish, aunt, you knew h w nicely I can fit
myself. I shall have so much time for sewing. I
am sure I must have something to do."
"Time wiil get away faster than you imagine;
but you need a pretty morning dress ;" and Mrs.
Winthrop went to her wardrobe, and, after search-
ing for  few minutes, took down a handsome one
of her own. "Here is a dress which I was unfor-
tunate enough to upset ink on the front breadth ;
you may take it, and, leaving out that breadth,
make it over! for yourself, taking one of Laura's for
a pattern. ;Here is plenty of new material for.
waist and'sleeves."
Grace's "thank you,"-was very genuine,,for she
had begun to wonder what occupation she should
have.   he had been so used to a busy life that she
easily imagined Boston, with nothing in it for her
to do, ould be very dull.
The twilight hour, again, brought visions of
home. She strove to be cheerful, but she'was not
sorry when she could go to sleep and dream of the
life she had left, and which seemed to her now
must be always fresh and beautiful.

The next day was cold and wintry, but Grace
did not heed it much, she was so bisy with her
needle. The morning dress was f st assuming
shape ; and, before her aunt thought such a thing
possible, the young lady presented, herself most be-
comingly arrayed in it.
Grace had been in Boston nearly two weeks, and
was sitting at twilight in her room thinking of
home, and wishing she could hear fro  the  when
Laura came smiling in.
" Suppose I were a fairy," said she, 'what would
you ask me to bring you."
"A letter from home," said Grace.
"Granted. HMere is a letter fro  Ernest; he
writes very well,'' said she, glancing at the address
as she handed it to her cousin."
Grace took the letter eagerly, bu the moment
her eye rested on it her deep blush drew Laura's
attention.
"All that over a letter from Ernest! I am afraid
I must call you to an account for this; but you
shall have a fair chance to enjoy it while I go and
try a piece of music which came this afternoon.'
Grace went to' the window, and, with a beating
heart broke the seal. It was, indeed, a letter from
Doctor Allerton, written so full of pleasant things,
that she smiled, involuntarily as she read. Not an
allusion to any thing that occurred he afternoon
before she left. He told her of ho e, and of his
own doings, in a way that held her an attentive
reader to the end, and made her tur the sheet to
see if, in some corner, she could not find another
morsel.

Graced roused very quickly at this, and turning
to Mr. Sinclair made a truthful.apology, that she
was thinking very strongly of .home, but she had
conie back now, and would promise to be very at-
tentive in future. She enjoyed the music, and re-
sponded very heartily to her uncle's smile, when
he told her how glad he was to have some, repre-
sentative from Beqchford at. his Thanksgiving
table.
After Thanksgiving the odd routine of the house-
hold seemed.established. Colonel Winthrop's uni-
formity was unconsciously felt in all the family
regulations. After breakfast Laura usually prac-
ticed, while Grace read,-or sewed or wrote, just as
she fancied. Then, if they had shopping, they
went out, but were expected to be at home by
twelve, the hour for driving in winter. They were
usually at home again a little after one, in time to
dress for dinner. Mrs. Winthrop remained in the
parlor after that, and expected the young ladies to
sit with her. They usually had some light sewing
or embroidery. Then Grace often thought of her
mother's mending-basket, and felt almost reproach-
ed when she remembered how much she must be
needed to take stitches which were necessarily
added to her mother's and Annie's already filled
up time.
Mrs. Winthrop and Laura had a large circle of
acquaintances, so th t they usually had calls after
dinner. Wednesday afternoon Mrs. Winthrop made
calls. Of course Grace was soon included in their
list of friends, and began to go out with them.
After tea they had music. Colonel Winthrop al-

glowing in her heart,.and when a letter ca e, her.
gladness was child-like in its expression. She had.
answered Doctor Allerton's letter finding it not
such a difficult task as she had anticipated. Her
journey furnished themes enough.  His second
letter had been even more acceptable than t e first,
it 'seemed less like a stranger. On the whole, thirst-
ing for home news as she was, the arrangement
might be a very good one, since it involved not the
least obligation on either side.
Ernest had written, but he was very bush. He.
was teaching again, and reciting by himself to Doc-
tor Allerton, of whom he spoke in term of in-
creasing respect and confidence. He missed Grace
every where ; it seemed to him that all Beechford
was lonely without her. Annie, out of the multi-
tude of her cares, wrote very seldom. She wrote
cheerfully, but Grace always felt a little sad after
reading her letters. .She thought of her o vn leis-
ure, and Annie's busy hours, and still shecculd not
see how she could help it. Once she spoke of this
to Laura.

CHAPTER XV.
HOW   THE DAYS WENT ON.'
. rp HE sewing was like a charm to Grace, and
T   the days flew on rapidly, until the earl part
of January had come. She sat by the bright,
cheerful fire sewing and thinking when Laura came
up from practicing. "Here, Miss Grace," said she,
"see what is expected of you. Mrs. Marshall has
sent invitations for a party next week. So you
will have to lay asides your practical work, and set
about preparing for t e occasion.".
i Oh, Laura ! I can' go ; I have n't any th ng to
wear, besides  -"
S" Not another wor I; Colonel Winthrop will not
excuse you, unless you are sick in bed. The
Marshall's are his special friends, and go you must.
And by way of encouragement, let me tell you'
this is only the beginning of a series."
"'Oh, Laura !"
Laura laughed. "Mother is going out this
morning to get you a dress."
"Let me wear one of your old ones."
"No, Miss Grace, I shall not agree to that; you
are to be new entirely. Mother says she shall shop
(zoo)

this morning, and we can go oi not, as we
please."
"I'll stay-at home, then.. I had rather aunt
woulld select what she pleases without asking me."
"And I will go; so you- may sit in expectancy
until our return."
Laura was -soon ready, and accompanied .her
mother out, while Grace sewed on and wondered
if going to parties would be half as, pleasant as
their social evenings at home.
When Laura returned, she placed in her cousin's
hands a roll, with her mother's compliments. Grace
open d it and discovered a dress-pattern, of rich,
white silk.. She surveyed it with afeeling akin to
dismay. It was more elegant than she. ever saw
for a bride to wear, and now she was to be arrayed
in it for an evening party!
" When you recover sufficiently, I should like to
show you mine," said her cousin, highly amused at
the expression of her speaking face. Opening her
package, she, displayed a dress of the same mate-
rial, only it was pink.-
"Are you relieved by seeing this ?"
"Yes ; that' seems so beautiful and proper for
you, but I think I should have a less costly mate-
rial."
"Don't criticise your aunt's taste," said Laura.
"Shemight not like it, you'know; she has engaged
the dress-maker to come to-morrow, so behold
yourself arrayed ! Will you take a pocket-hand-
kerchief to-hem,.you queer, old-fashioned body, or
will you spend the evening.at Mrs. Marshall's, just
as I ave had to spend a great nany. I'm so glad

mother has somebody to, fix besides me, and that
that somebody is you, Grace Winthrop."
The dressmaking was accomplished and every-
thing in readiness for the party. The evening was
clear and cold, and the two girls were in their'
room dressing. Grace's beautiful hair had a way
of its own, which Laura. always insisted should be
followed in dressing it.  Her cheeks wer rosy
with health, and her violet eyes were full f ex-
pression.  She was taller than Laura, th  two
formed a striking contrast.. Laura's pink silk and
flowers of the same hue in her jet black hai were
very becoming.
"Here, Grace," said she, "you must wear my
pearls to-night; they are all you need to complete
your dress."
"Pearls, Laura! I think I have on borrowed
plumage enough ; please do not add your beautiful
pearls. I shall surely lose them ; besides, I've got
into the mist of fairy land again. I expect all my
fine things may vanish at any moment."
"Grace Winthrop, you are a queer girl; you
will appear in Mrs. Mar hall's .drawing-room to-
night as if you had worh white silk always; and
my pearls will seem 'to de honored by your wear-
ing them. I think father must have been thinking
of you when he bought them. I admire them very
much, but they are too fair for me. I must see
them on you to-night. I am sure you will wear
them to please me."
"Yes, to please you; but if I lose them?"
I will take the blame, then." So Laura clasped
the pearls about her cousin s neck and arms, and

FIFTY YEARS AGO.         203

smiled in quiet satisfaction t9 see how well they
became her. The mirror reflected a lovely picture,
as Grace stoo before it to see the effect of Laura's
pearls, and just at that moment she remembered
a verse her mother gave her to learn once when
she was a little girl and had shown strong symp-
toms of vanity: "Whose adorning, let it not be
that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of
wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let
it be the hidden man of the heart." It came like a
gentle, friendly whisper, and seemed to give the
outward adornment its real place. The principles
of internal beauty, in which she had been so thor-
oughly trained, asserted their supremacy and
quenched the uprisings of vanity. She knew that
her dress was rich and becoming, and she admired
it, but she knew that it was not herself.
Mrs. Marshall's drawing-room was brilliant with
the guests .assembled there, the very lite of the
city  Colonel Winthrop was always one of the last
to arrive on such occasions, for the sole reason that
being obliged to stay until a proper hour for leav-
ing, he shortened the time while he had it in his
control. An hour later in his arrival, made an
hour less to stay. He liked dinner parties; but he
only endured evening parties because .he wished
his wife and daughter to observe the customs of
society.
Mrs. Winthrop was conscious of chaperoning
two. very pretty girls; and enjoyed the attention
they received. T~o Grace the scene was novel and
interesting.. She enjoyed it in perfect unconscious.
ness of the pleasing impressions. she was making.

She forgot her white silk dress,.and even Laura's
pearls, in' listening to and observing the people
about her; nor was she deficient in her share of
conversation. Shehad met Henry Marshall and
several other of'the gentlemen at her uncle's house.
She had met all of Laura's particular lady friends,
so she was not quite a stranger. She designed to
keep as near Laura as possible, but they were often
unavoidably separated ; then her quick perceptive
faculties proved verge reliable friends. During the
evening she was introduced to a Mr. Lenox, who
like herself had lately come to Boston. He was a
nephew of Mrs. Marshall and had just commenced
practicing law. - He attached. himself particularly
.to her, quite to the annoyance, Laura thought, of
some who called themselves older friends.
The evening had its variety of amusement and
entertainment and quickly wore away. Colonel
Winthrop was as sure to be the first to go as he
had been the last to come. His friends laughed at
what they termed his "military precision," but'
that never moved his purpose.
"It is time to go,' Mrs. Winthrop," wasthe sig:
nal for that lady, without undue haste, to assemble
her forces and be ready to leave. Henry Marshall
and Mr. Lenox were waiting to escort the young
ladies to the carriage.
"Well, Grace !" said Colonel Winthrop, on their
Way home, "how have you enjoyed your first party
in:Bostonb?"
"Very much, uncle; it seemed to me something

in it."
"I do not 'qdite understand who that Mr. Lenox
was, Laura," said her father.
"He is a nephew of Mrs. Marshall's, a young
[awyer lately come to Boston. Mrs. Marshall in-
troduced him to us."
" Oh!.very well.", And Laura knew her father
was satisfied so far. When they reached home the
girls went directly to their room, where they found
i cheerful fire, and Mrs. Clark asleep in an easy
:hair. i She was a faithful old sentinel; and after
luly admiring -the young ladies, and putting up
:heir wrappers, she left them to get warm before
;hey went to bed.
" Here are your pearls, Laura," said Grace, as
;he carefully replaced them in the jewel case. ":I
im h ppy to return them safe and sound, and to
ay that they did not keep me in an anxious state
ill the evening. My attention was so occupied
vith he people about me that I forgot all about

the people if I had ! I saw some ladies there to-
night who were all made up, of fine clothes; it
seemed to me that they laughed when there was
nothing to laugh at, and talked when they had
nothing to say. I saw a lady hanging on Mr.
Rexford's arm., who reminded me so strongly of
one of the pictures on Aunt Lois's fan that Ilwas
half a mind to shake - hands with her, for old ac-
quaintance sake. I saw some very pretty ones
too, and some beautiful dresses."
"Did you see much of Lizzie M rshall ?"
"Yes, and I liked her very much."
"How.did you like the gentlemen-Mr. Lenox,
for instance ?"
"Very well; I think he is very agreeable."
"Do you like Henry Marshall ?"
"Yes, I do; better than ,any of your gentlemen
acquaintances; he seems to me frank and sin ere,
like Ernest."
"How does he compare with Robert 9ak-
ley?"

"I like him better. You know I did not
much of Robert Oakley, but I think I should

Ernest's manly ways that I do not fancy pe
who say so many things which I am sure t
cannot mean."

som thing better suited to 'going right to bed,' as
Auntie told us to when we came up-stairs?"
Laura roused herself and began to lay aside her
dres .
"I is such a luxury to have, somebody to go out
with me and then come home and chat over a nice
fire," said she, "that I shall forget to go to bed at
all by-and-by."
It took Grace some time to get asleep after she
and Laura had said good-night. She was thinking
of the last winter evenings, where they all met in
Mrs. Lee's sitting-room and recited to Dr. Aller-
ton. She was very happy then, and as she went
over the scenes - and contrasted them  with .this
evening, she fell asleep and knew no more of the
joys and sorrows of life until Mrs. Clark opened
the linds and let in a full tide of morning light.
H nry Marshall and Mr. Lenox were guests at
Col nel Winthrop's house the next evening after
Mrs. Marshall's party; indeed, from that time they
were often there. Mrs. Marshall's party was, as
Laura had said, only the beginning of a series.
More new dresses were purchased, until Grace
found herself in possession of quite an extensive
wardrobe. She had persuaded her aunt to dis-
pense with the dress-maker beyond fitting. She
proved herself so skillful and capable with her nee-
dle, that Mrs. Winthrop was quite satisfied with its
results. Her time was now fully occupied ; they.
rarely had an evening to themselves. If they were
at. home, .Henry Marshall or Mr. Lenox or Mr.
Rexford were there, sometimes all three at once:

sation, and Mrs. Winthrop, in her easy chair,
always an entertaining hostess. One evening
the early partlof February, they were all at a pa
at Mrs. Sinclair's. .Grace had been listening tc
entertaining account of some of Mr, Lenox's trav
when she bethought her of Laura and proposed
go and look her up. Mr. Lenox rallied her on'
great devotion to her cousin, remarking at
same time that she was standing nearly oppo
them in the next room apparently quite interes
in conversation with a gentleman who was
stranger to him. Grace looked over that way a

i her father's mind, was his probable errand.
Until their visit, in New York, she had never
t ougit of any closer friendship between Robert
akle and herself than had always existed. At
times, Isince then, she had not felt, quite so sure-
perhaps not quite so sure of herself either-at

Henry Marshall,  during the winter, that she had

She had from the first liked him; because he was
in some .things, she fancied, after the manner of
Ernes". To be "like Ernest," Laura knew meant
as high a. compliment as Grace could pay, and
Grace had such an instinctive insight into charac-
ter, that Laura found herself influenced by her
more than she could have thought possible.
To-:bight, when they were seated by their. own
glowing fire, ready to talk over the events of the
evenirig, Laura's face wore a troubled look, and'
she poked the fire in a restless sort of way, as if
she hoped to rouse up something cheering from its
embers.
.What a dreadfllyunsatisfactory fire that is;'

York I hardly knew what to think of myself or
him  ither, but I am convinced now that we can
never be any thing but .friends. I think he was
disappointed in my lack of pleasure at meeting
him this evening. -I did not mean to be unkind,
but I was sorry h6 had come."
"I do not see any great difficulty in getting
along with uncle, since you are going, to do just
what he wants you to."
" I had rather ie would never know that his
sure prophecy w s fulfilled ; but I will leave the
management to you. I feel better, now that I have
told you what tr9 ubles me, and a little sleep, if I
can get it, will ma ke me better still."
The next day, at the usual hour for riding, Grace
came down stairs alone, and met her uncle just
buttoning up his overcoat in the hall. "Where is'
Laura," said he.
"She wishes yqu would excuse her, uncle. She
wants to stay at home to-day."

obliged to make. She knew her fearless, winning
way was equal to an emergency, and that she

did, for- she advised me to let you take your own
way. She thought your companionship would be
of service to Laura, and so I think it has. You are on
very friendly terms with Henry Marshall I observe."
"Yes, sir, I like him, and I think Laura does,
too. I liked him from the first, because I thought
he had some ways like Ernest."
"He is to be relied on, and his business habits
are excellent. YoU have had such a home educa-
.on, Grace, that you know what real worth is, and
1 would trust your judgment sOoner than I would
some of our Boston girls."
Colonel Winthrop was by this 'time in good hu-
mor, evidently quite relieved by the truthful man-
ner of his niece. When they reached home, he
looked at his watch, and said, as they had 'nearly
an hour before diner, he would drive on and walk
back. Grace wen in, and as the parlor 'door was
shut, she went on utp to her aunt's door and knockeI
softly. There was no response, and thinking she
might be sleeping, she went on to her room.
Laura was not there, and after :making herself
ready for dinner, she sat down to sew for Annie,
thinking what a satisfactory ride she had had, and
what an unsatisfactory one she might have had if
she and her uncle had been in opposite interests.
Just before the hour for dinner, Laura came up.
stairs, looking as if she lacked the vigor which a
cheerful heart anl the invigorating morning air,
had given her couin.
" Has Mr. Oakley gone ?" asked Grace, after
waiting awhile for Laura to speak.

DEVELOPMENTS.
f   NE morning,   few weeks after the events
mentioned in the last chapter, Grace had
been out alone to buy some of the innumerable
trimmings which her aunt deemed necessary for
an eveni g dress. She had finished her errand,
and was r turning, hen she met Mr. Lenox. He
turned and joined her in her walk. The day was
fine, and the sleighing excellent. He proposed
calling for her after dinner to take a ride.
"If Laura has no engagements, I think we can
go," said Grace.
"Your cousin is a very agreeable companion,
Miss Winthrop; but for once I would like to see
how you appear separately. If you have no objec-
tions, I will only extend my invitation to you this
time."
. Grace thanked him and accepted, feeling half
afraid she had done wrong. She never went.out
without Laura, and if her uncle should happen to
fancy that it was not desirable for her to do so, she
had certainly got herself into trouble. Mr. Lenox;
of late, had been very attentive. Doctor Allerton

"Shall we take a look at Bunker Hill? It seems
to be the attractive spot just now."
"Any where you please," said Grace.
"I please to ride," said Mr. Lenox, laughing,
"and just now Bunker Hill seems the most famil-
iar spot I can remember."
"I forgot you are a new-homer,' said Grace,
" and perhaps do not know the drives about Bos-
ton as well as I do. Uncle considers riding part
of our daily business; so we get very familiar with
the beautiful views in the whole vicinity. He
minds the cold very little, and fresh airis his rem-
edy for every thing. Laura says she and auntie
ought to be order-loving, for they have had good
military training ever since she can remem-
ber."
I suppose your uncle owes his good health to
his uniform exercise," said Mr. Lenox. "Uncle
Marshall tells me he was a man of great energy
and constant-activity. The change from a busi-
ness-life to one of comparative rest must be very
trying to such a person.'
Unconsciously, then, Grace spoke of her father
and of home until she almost forgot that her at-.
tentive listener was so lately a stranger.
It was enough for Mr. Lenox to watch the kind-
ling, glowing face of the young girl beside him as
she spoke of Ernest, an the many rides she had
had with him,coasting nd sleighing and on horse-
back.
Before they knew it, they had reached: Bunker

She saw that her answer did not please him.. In
her own sweet way, she quickly added, "I have
had a very pleasant rid , Mr. Lenox, and shall
hope to see ±ou soon."
"Perhaps I ought not to have said that,' thought
she, as she stood waiting for Ralph to let her in.
She went directly to her room to lay aside her'
wrappings and get warm before going down to the
parlor. She felt troubled. An undefined sense of
something real, into which she must enter, was
somewhere in the distance--.a feeling akin to that
which one might have in watching a net-work
weaving about him without consenting to the pro-
cess and yet seeming to have no power to escape.
She stood thinking so intently that she forgot
how near the tea-hour was until she heard Mrs.
Clark coming to look for her. .Turning, to pick
up her handkerchief, which she had laid on the
table, she saw a letter directed to her lying there.
She took it up and recognized Doctor Allerton's
writing.
How strange it is! Doctor Allerton always
comes in collision with Mr. Lenox.- Here I find
him waiting for me; and with a sense of gladness
and relief she put it ii he po ket and went downs
stairs.
"Why !" said Laura," did not know you had
come in. Have you been at home long ?"
" ot long ; only time enough to get warm."
" You look as if the air had done you good,"
said\her uncle. "You haia fine ride, I suppose."
After tea, Grace joined Laura at the piano.

home and its association 'than she had ever done
before. He did not see  to be such a "wise, old
man" as she had always thought him-not that his
wisdom grew lcss in he estimation, but she was
becoming more' accustomed to the society of
gentlemen of his age.
Charlie Thorn and Edward Nelson were more
like brothers. They had been school-mates from
childhood, playfellows with whom she had always
felt such equality. that sh could laugh and enjoy
their mutual sports without remembering that she
was no longer a little girl. Now it was all differ-.
ent. She was brought in contact with people so
much older than herself and was expected to rise
to their level. Mr. Lenox was as old as Doctor
Allerton;, Henry Marshall/and Mr. Rexford were
older. As she grew better acquainted with these
gentlemen, it had the effect of making her feel bet
ter acquainted with Doctor Allerton.
Her revery could not last, for her uncle would
notice her absence at this hour; and as she only
mentioned Ernest's and Annie's letters, she pre,

Laura knew, by her bright expression,,that some-

" Is it Mr. Lenox or octor Allerton ?" whis-

eye.

Lenox played the flute and Mr. Marshall sang, so
they often had musical entertainments.
Mr. Lenox was not here this even ng, but Henry
Marshall and Mr. Rexford were, and     Laura
thought her cousin's voice had caught the echo of
the birds, it rang out so clear and sweet.
"I never told you much about m  mother's sing-
ing," said Colonel Winthrop, as he paused in front
of Mrs. Winthrop's chair.  "Our Laura .has a
sweet voice, but Grace has tones o exactly' like
her grandmother that I hear her almost as dis-
tinctly as I used to when I was a ittle boy; and
the world held no treasure like my  other."
He .did not wait for Mrs. Winthrop's answer,
but continued his walk, with 'his thoughts turned
backward to old scenes which he had deemed all
faded out. When the music ceased, he said, "Sing
again. I l ve to listen to.you," and they sang on
until the evening was nearly passed, before their
host remembered much of present things. "Home
is the pleasantest place, girls," said he, after their
guests were gone and he was securing the win-
dows. "I shall be glad when our evening visits
are through with."
"Grace and I enjoy our evenings t home," said
Laura. "I think we have been out a great deal
this winter.'
They had, indeed, accepted more invitations
than usual, ut Colonel Winthrop's abit of going
late, and co ing away as soon as politeness would
allow, had s vd them from very late ours.. Some-
times his friends rallied him on hi early leave-
taking, but he only shook his head, and..said, "I

approve of sociability, bu I do not approve of late
hours. Besides, we go o t so often, it is necessary.
to be in the habit of reaching home before morn-
ing."
Mr. Lenox was a ple sant friend, and always
ready to attend Grace o these occasions, but she
was careful not to give 'him too much opportunity.
She could not define her eelings in respect to him.
She certainly liked him. His pleasing address
and cultivated mind made him acceptable every-
where. And what of    r. Lenox? -.He certainly
liked Grace Winthrop.  e was attracted by her
face the first evening he et her at Mrs. Marshall's.
The whole company were strangers to him, and
he had come more in the mood to, criticise than
to cultivate anybody's acquaintance. He had
been introduced to several ladies before the Win-
throp party arrived. He did not see them when
they came in, but, in looking for Henry Marshall,
he saw a beautiful girl standing near his aunt. H r
attire was rich, bpt so simple and so in unison wilh
the style of her face and figure, that he paused to
admire her, and then sought, an introduction.
From that evening he had cultivated Grace Win-
throp's acq uaintance.  e was charmed' with her
sprightly, intelligent conversation , so unlike the
style of the young' ladies he was accustomed to
meet on such occasions.. He was a favorite in so-
ciety, and used to flattering attentions. But she
puzzled him. She was always polite, but never
manifested any especial pleasure at meeting him.
He had been wishing for an informal opportunity
to get her all to himself for a little while. Eve-

could ask for her. His delicate attentions and his
thoughtful kindness were such as her refined taste
could -fully appreciate. He could make her future
home one of luxury and ease. Thrown so much
into his society, she could not fail to know that her
coming gave him pleasure, that his hand extended
to greet her and draw her to himself, whenever an
opportunity occurred. .As the weeks went on, she
grew more conscious that an interview she dread-
ed would meet her somewhere. Sometimes she
thought she really loved Mr. Lenox, and if Doctor
Allerton's image came thrusting itself between
them, she would grow indignant and determine
never to answer another of his letters. She' usually
ended in wishing for the days of her childhood,
when her mother could decide doubtful question.
She did not know that that same mother was
daily praying that she might he .led in a way
which would 'work out the most abundant honor
to her Heavenly Father, and be for her own high-
est good. She did not realize hdw deeply inter-
woven with her very being were the prayers she
had heard, and the principles she had been taught,
all through that childhood for which she had
longed. She did not know that she had come to
one of life's turning points around which clustered.
'so much of the great; shadowy future. The path
she would 'take seemed all of her own choosing.
" Except thy presence go with her, take her not
hence" was uttered in faith, when she left her fa-
ther's house; and that " Presence" was with the
maiden, tQ guide and influence her in all the trying

as a good omen, and determined to decide the mat-
te r as soon as an opportunity presented itself. Par-
ties werd done with for the present, and neither of
the girls were sorry. Grace could not divest her-
self of the feeling that she was living very much
for herself. She often thought of her mother's
weary footsteps and Annie's busy fingers, and then
she sewed industriously on the yet unfinished gar-
ments for her sister. Jaura shared in the pleasure
'of Doctor Allerton's letters, and often remarked,
that they always made her feel as if there was
something higher to be attained than she had ever
found.
"lHe does not preach," said she ; "he carries you
right along aid makes you think as he does, and
he tells of things at home so charmingly that I al-
ways see just how it looks there."
Grace thought so too, even if she did not say so.
She did not find them difficult to answer, either;
they were so suggestive, and she never thought
how much thmy influenced her.
One evening in the latter part of April Colonel
Winthrop was suffering fro  a severe cold and
headache, a ting so unusual with him, that he re-
quired Mrs. Winthrop's constant attention.  He
went to his room as soon as tea was over, and the
girls were left alone in the parlor. It seemed so
still all over the house, and so unusual to have a
quiet evening down-stairs, that Laura declared it
was either the Spring air or t, e silent house which
had made. her -very sleepy. She believed she
should go to lied.
" I am not sleepy," said Grace. " I do not be-

lieve we shall have any company, so I I ill let you
go while I stay and finish the book which I began
last .week."
"That is a very good example for me, but I can-
not follow it to-nfight. I've been sleepy all day."
" Mother says sleep is a very good medicine,"
said Grace, laug ing. "So go and take it and I
will have a nice time all to myself."
Laura went, and Grace, drawing her aunt's easy
chair near the light, sat down to read. Her book
was very interesting, and she was soon deeply en-
gaged in its contents. How long she had been
reading, she did ot know. She did not hear any-
body come in uptil a familiar voice said, " Good
evening, Miss Winthrop," and looking up she saw
Mr. Lenox standing near her.
" Why, Mr. Lenox !" said she, "how did you
come in ?-e--I did ot hear a sound."
"Not through the key-hole, or down the chim-
ney ; the day for doing' such things in Massachu-
setts is past, you .know ; but I found the house
so silent that I almost fancied I had got into the
wrong one. Are you lady hostess alone to-night ?"
"Not lady hos ess, exactly. I was more selfishly
occupied. Laur and I make a great many resolu-
tions to read, an I have been trying .to carry out
one single one of mine. Uncle has a headache and
went to his room after tea. Aunt is with him, and
Laura, I am so ry to say, Mr. Lenox-but if I-
should go for he , I am afraid I should find her fast
asleep. She was very tired to-night."
Mr. Lenox had been standing near the fire oppo-
site to Grace; h~e had' hardly listened to a word

she said, he was so charmed with the picture she
made in her ait's deeply-cushioned chair. The
light from the tll wax candles fell on her shining
hair and bright face. There was nothing studied
in her attitude or in anythin  she said. It was
God's gift of beauty, and simp e unaffected grace,
that made her o lovely to loo upon, and. His gift
of higher love which had kept pack the dark shad-
ow of vanity and pride from sp oiling the fair tem-
ple. Mr. Lenox's silence mad  Grace look up to
meet his eyes,,o intently fixed upon her that the
color came quickly .to her face, and she said, "I
will go and see if the journey up-stairs did not
wake Laura up if you will excuse me."
"No," said he; "I cannot e cuse you, or allow
you to call you  cousin. I do not wish to see her
to-night; this ,pportunity to ee you alone is just
what I have been seeking, to ell you what I am
sure you must know already."
He had cone nearer to her now, and Grace lis-
tened to his words of strong pleading affection with
a frightened, aching heart,; for weeks she had fear-
ed that this hour would come' and she-how was
she to meet it?
Mr. Lenox was every thing she could ask, so far
as this world goes, and the wonder to her had often
been that a gentleman 'so accepted and flattered by,
ladies generally, should'seek he so decidedly. She
adnaired him nd enjoyed his society, and yet she
could never think of him, except as a very pleasant
friend, just as! he did Henry Marshall. .She had
studiously -avodeed being alor e' within him, and he
knew it; but le was none the less determined to

win her. It was late when the interview closed.
Mrs. Clark had come at the usual hour to put out
the lights and shut the house; but quickly taking
in how matters stood, she kept her own counsel
and waited until the quiet shutting of the front
door reminded her that she might again appear on
the scene of action.
Laura had awakened and wondered where Grace
was; the fire was still burning and the light was
not put out. She looked at her watch, and finding
it so late was just going to look for her when she
heard her come in and shut the door, so still that
she evidently designed to disturb nobody.
"Why, Grace !" said she, "do you know what
time it is? I shall never leave you down-stairs
alone again, if this is the way you are going to do."
" I am sure I hope you will not," said Grace, as
she threw herself on the bed and, covering her face
with her hands, weptsuch bitter tears as she had
never shed before.
"What is the matter-what has happened ?" said
Laura, really alarmed ".is father sick ?"
"'No; it's Mr. Lendx."
"Mr. Lenox sick ?" said Laura.
"Oh, Laura! nobody is sick. Mr. Lenox has
been here this evening, and I'm so sad and wretch-
ed," and again sheawept convulsively.
" Oh, that is it !" anda very clear light dawned
into Laura's mind, " Wait until you have lived
three years more. Have you refused Mr. Lenox,
Grace ?"-
"Yes; and he is angry with me, and he has been
so kind ever since I knew him. He was willing to

wait without ai answer, and le every thinggo on
as before. I k  w that was no, best, and told him
so; but he says he shall not consider himself an-
swered until I ave waited two months. It is very
foolish for him to prolong the matter. I'm sure I
have considered it enough. I vish uncle need not
know it."
"I think he suspects the state of affairs now, but
it is not necessary for him to k ow anything more.
1 aln sure it would please him very much to have
you marry Mr. Lenox. You #illnever do better;
and if you do not. love Doctor Allerton, I cannot
understand yo r indifference to him."
"Please, Laura, do not speal4 of Doctor Allerton
or anybody e e. I wish I could stay up.in this
room and se only you for a hole month. I do
not believe Aaie ever had so much trouble. She
liked Sandford Ross and he li ed her. I think it's
dreadful to bea young lady."
"Well, don't cry about it a y more. If you do
not look after he fire and the light, you will have
to cone to be  in the dark, a d ,that will not help
anything, yo  now."
Grace passed a wearisome night. Sometimes
she would co trast the ease which wealth brings
with the cars and toil of her mother's daily life.
She knew sh couldenjoy the leisure which might
be hers, and  en Mr. Lenox was such a pleasant
friend. She really enjoyed his society. Why could
she not accept what really. seemed to be a most de--
sirable offer. Doctor Allerton was nothing to her;
he had startle her by his unexpected proposition;
while Mr. Lenox had given her timely warning.


232.,

So Iar as she was concerned, the result was the
same in both cases. The more she thought, the
more perplexed .she grew, until at last, in a strong,
fervent petition for help and stre' gth to Him who
giveth wisdom to His children when they ask it,
she let the urden go and fell asleep.
The dayswhich followed were sadder than Grace
had ever known, life seemed. to her so real and
earnest. She thought of the time when she felt no
responsibility about anything, when she just min-
gled with all the joys and perplexities of home, and
frolicked with the children, and went and came
with Ernest, and had such a free, bounding world
of happiness.
Her position with Mr. Lenox was painful, he was
so delicate in his attentions, doing just the things
which she could not reject, and never presuming
on any claim. He gave her no opportunity to be
annoyed, and yet she felt that he held her to the
promise of another interview. Things were in
this way when one day about the middle of May,
Colonel Winthrop handed Grace a letter to read.
It was from Ernest. The vacancy which Colonel
Winthrop had so long kept in view would occur
the first of June. He had written to Ernest mak-
ing the necessary arrangements, and informing him
to come on a week before the time, to mike a visit,
and get ready for his r'ew occupation. 'his letter
was Ernest's acceptance, and announced his inten-.
lion to be with them in a few days. Grace could
hardly believe it possible that he was actually com.
ing. To see him and talk with him would be al-
most equal to going hme:

"Now, Grate," said Laura, " I expect you will
bid me good-bye for some days, until you have ex-
hausted Ernes 's whole catalogue of news."
The day hewas to come Grace watched and
waited. At last, leaning over the balusters, she
caught the sound of his well - known voice, and
went down th stairs in most undignified haste to
welcome him. Ralph smiled all over his face to
" see Miss Grace so happy." And. Ernest felt that
her fond greeting .was worth all the world to him
just then. " hy, Grace, how you have changed !"
said he, as he held her at arm's length, and sur-
veyed her wit mingled love and pride.
"Oh,. no !  have not changed, Ernest, only
grown older. I'm going to be nineteen, sometime,
and that is older than you used to be,".added she,
laughing.
Grace's styl of dress was so unlike that in which
he had been accustomed to see her, that at first
glance she see ed unlike herself. She looked old-
er, more like  beautiful woman, than the thought-
less girl he had always known rher. The' new
scenes through which she had passed, and being
obliged to ac on her own responsibility, had in-'
sensibly developed her character.
Ernest was cordially welcomed by the rest 'of
the family. Colonel Winthrop smiled to see how
happy Grace looked. " I knew it would be neces-
sary for you to come in advance of anjy busine is
arrangements,'' said he, ''for Grace must be satis-
fied about Beechfo~rd before she can let you go."
Grace had indeed a great many questions to ask.
Annie had written her by Ernest, but her letter

covered only a small part of her inq iries. She
wanted to know every thing that had happened in
her absence.
Ernest had much to tell of his final c rming. "I
missed you, Grace. I wanted you to h lp me over
the difficulties; but then, perhaps, you h lped me as
much being here. I should be almost faint-hearted
without you, father will miss me, and mother's
face looked so sad when I told, her good-bye, that
my courage half failed me; but Charles is getting
to be a big boy, an  Henry and Arthur are fast
coming on. I did n t know that I lo ed the old
farm so well until I eent over. it for the last time.
It did not seem much like our journey with only
the prospect of staying away two weeks."
Grace understood it all, but she was too happy
to think he had come to be where sh could see
him perhaps every day, to allow him :o bed very
despondent. She adked about every body but
Doctor Allerton, and of him Ernest had much to
say. "I feel greatly indebted to him for many val-
uable suggestions," said he, "his teachings and. his
society have been highly useful to me.  was sorry
to leave him, but I ail glad Beechford has so val-
uable a man in it.  do not expect to find many
such men even in Bo ton."
As the days of Ernest's visit wore on, Grace
found herself no nea er the end of her conversa-
tion with him. He old her how much they all
missed her, and that mother had often s id she did
not know that Grace flled so .large a place in the
house.
Colonel Winthrop would have offered Ernest a

home in his amily if he had thought it the best
thing for him. "Our hours do not suit the hours
of business men," said he. "I want you. to.have
no hindrance . You have a fine situation, and I
expect you to fill it with fidelity. Come here every
Sunday, and as often as. you find it convenient dur-
ing the wee , but attend to your business first.
You shall have a room which we will call yours,
and a welcome always."
Grace saw t once that, this was best, though it
would have. rejoiced her heart to meet him every
day.
Ernest entered, upon his new duties in humble
reliance on that Divine aid which had so effectual-
ly kept him thus far on his way. Religion had
become to him a living reality.; before he left his
father's house he had publicly professed his faith in
his Saviour. This had softened t e parting to his
mather's heart; she could trust h r boy, when  e
trusted his Saviour. The changes in his life was
very great, but he was determined to meet it faith-
fully; of course he had much to. learn, but he had
all of the elements of success in his character.
His uncle's recommendation and influence gave
him a good foundation in the opinion of his em-
ployers, and right manfully did he undertake the
task.
If he had loved and confided in his sister before,
he found her doubly valuable now. Her clear
views, and bright color gs, lifted him out of his
sombre moods. He looked forward to the even-
ings he would spend with her with a sense of rest,
and through her he began to feel better acquainted

with his aunt and cousin, and the house assumed
more of a home look  She had found great relief
in telling him of heri correspondence  ith Doctor
Alleton, and her acquaintance with Mr. Lenox.
He was "surprised and delighted at the former.
"I used to wonder, Grace, that he never made
many inquiries about you. I think you may feel
yourself honored that he has chosen you for a cor-
respondent. If I only knew half as .much as he.
does I should be glad; he has been of great assist-
ance to me in fitting me for my place. I am sorry
for Mr. Lenox, and if I am going to liv in Boston,
Isshould consider my happiness complete to have
you here, too; but don't marry a man whom you
do not thoroughly like, Grace."
"I do like Mr. Lenox, but I do not want to
marry him. I have about made up my mind not to
marry any body ; you will be surprise when you
come home to visit a few years from now, to find
me making clothes for the boys just as Annie does.".
"I suppose so," said her brother, with an incred-
ulous smile. "In the meantime,.you tvill, doubt-
less try your-skill on me. Annie has been fitting
me up all winter, and at present I am in a very
good condition ; but by , an9 by the buttons will
begin to fall off, and the rei ts come, and then I
shall know where to go."
" You cannot find a busier needle. Aunt thinks
I need every thing new, now that sumrher is com-
ing, and I suppose I do. I am so glad that she is'
finding out that I can help myself a little'. She

myself yesterday. I always think how pleased

mother would be when I doa thing nicely. Some-
times I imagine I hear her say, 'Annie, what do you
suppose Grace is doing?' and I answer back in my
heart, 'Remembering what you told her, mother;
remembering it always.'"
"That is just the way with me," said Ernest.
"Mother's words come 'to me many times in the
day. They seem to be part of myself. I do not
think we had better talk about it any more, or I
shall go straight to Beechford."
The green leaves, the budding flowers, and the
singing birds told that.June had come, and changed
the whole outward aspect of the goodly city.
Laura's world was changing, too, for she had prom-
ised Henry Marshall she would leave her father's
house, and go to dwell with him. Her father and
mother approved her choice, and Grace extended
a right cousinly hand to one whom she had learned
to esteem and respect. It seemed to be another
link binding her to Mr. Lenox. Laura told her
that it was the only thing wanting to make her
happiness complete. Ernest was a great comfort
to her. He made no attempt to influence her, nor
was he greatly surprised, when, one evening in the
early part of July, she told him, with more cheerful-
ness than he had seen her have of late, that Mr. Lenox
and herself could never be any more to each other
than they  ere at present. The question was de-
cided, and painful as their interview had been, she
had been happier ever since. ,The result of; that
decision was of greater importance than she could
then comprehend. The -choice was hers, apd .she
decided it as she wished.

Mr. Lenox was what the-world calls a brilliant
match. What hindered. her from walking with
him through the paths of ease and luxury which
were his, and which her presence would have ad-
orned ?
Had she not been given to her Saviour in the
very dawning of her existence, and had not fervent
petitions gone up from the heart of her father and
mother that she might be kept from temptation, and
delivered from evil? Mr. Lenox's loves with his
views of her faith, would have been a sn re, a vital
hindrance to her earthly mission. So, walking free-
ly in directed steps, she went on her way without
him.

1;ESULTS OF EARLY TRAINING.
G RACE'S final decision in regard to Mr. Le-
nox was a real disappointment to Henry
Marshall. He was so happy himself, that h's cous-
in's sadness oppressed him. Besides, he thought
Grace so fitted to complete Mr. Lenox's character,
he wondered she could not see how necessary she
was to his uture life.'- Laura shared in' his grief.
She wished now more than ever that her cousin
had been prevailed on to stay without going home
when she and Ernest came to visit them a year ago;
then she would not have known Doctor Allerton,
and though Grace did not acknowledge it, she was
very sure he was the strong power which held her
so firmly, and made her indifferent to Mr. Lenox's
love, and the advantages which his position offered.
Occasionally she would think she could not have
it so; but her warmest remonstrances were met
with so much sincerity, that she-ended with a con-
viction that Grace acted from right principles, and
there was no use in trying to influence her to do
contrary to her inclinations in the matter. One
thing she resolved she would do. She would cease

to feel any interest in Doctor Allerton's 1Ktters. She
was vexed at him, but she forgot it when the next
one canie, and listened to it as she always did, and
felt involuntarily drawn towards him as a personal
friend. She was perplexed and vexed, and finally
gave. the matter up: as something beyond her con-
trol.
Colonel Winthrop had been a close observer of
the way things were 'going ever since Mrs. Mar-
shall's party in the early winter. H  regarded
Henry Marshall and Mr. Lenox as every way de-
sirable matches for his daughter and niece.
To have Grace so finely provided for, "set in
the very niche she seemed made to fill,'' as he told,
Mrs. Winthrop, was a matter for quiet  ongratula-
tion. He kept his own counsel, and expected the
satisfactory ending with certainty, when suddenly
Mr. Lenox's frequent -visits were discontinued.
After waiting long enough to assure  imself that
somethin was wrong, he took an opportunity'
when he was alone with Grace to ask, with as-
sumed indifference, where Mr. Lenox was.
Grace was conscious of blushing very deeply,
and betraying a good deal of agitation; but she
managed to reply, " We do not see him as often as
we did in the winter."
Suddenly stopping before her; he said, "Is Doc-
tor Allerton in the way of your choice of Mr. Le-
nox
It was terrible for her to be thus questioned by
her uncle.. With a beating heart, she only replied,
" I do not think he is.",
" Doctor Allerton is a gentleman ; I admired him,,

but he has his own way to make, while - Mr. Lenox
can place his wife in a home of ease and luxuy.
The woman of his choice may feel herself honored.
I should be sorry to have you act unwisely in this
matter. Young people do not always know what
is best for them."
"I do not think-I am almost sure--" began
Grace, but the seal of silence fell on her lips. She
could not vindicate herself to him; he would not
understand her. Besides, she was so overcome by
his gentle ess, when she expected severity, that she
could no trust herself to speak; and when she
looked u he had gone without saying .another
word.
Her uncle had been her great dread. She ex-
pected little less than. positive displeasure, if he
ever knew it; but even he had uttered no, reproof.
She knew she had disappointed him, and that was
hard enough for her to bear.
"I have gone contrary to the wishes of the dear-
est friends I have outside of my home, and I cannot;
cannot help it. Ernest thinks I have done right,
and that is such a comfort."
Ernest came just.then, and a long walk with him
in the cool evening air refreshed and strengthened
her spirits. She had need of these .lifts out of her
daily life, for' besides the consciousness of her
friends' disappointments, she had occasionally to
meet Mr. Lenox. He endeavored to conceal his
wounds froni observant eyes, but to one who knew
him as she id, his bitterness was distressing. She"
could not.show him the kindness she felt; and was
greatly relieved when she learned through Henry

Marshall that he would be absent on business for
some weeks.
The evening after he left, Henry Marshall
brought her a note and a little sealed package.
She excused herself, and went up-stairs. She
opened the box, and found it containe  an exquis-
ite gold watch, just the mate to Laura's. The note
was from Mr. Lenox. The language was as kind
as a brother's could have been. " If," said he,
"you will accept and wear this, I shall regard
it as a seal of friendship, and will promise you,
with it for my token, that I will endeaor to culti-
vate less of bitterness than I have known since my
last interview with you. I am convinced of your
sincerity, and shall not seek to chang your decis-
ion. If you return this, I shall consider it a rejec-
tion of a peace-offering, on your part to one who
has great need of peace. Its acceptance cannot
involve you in any trouble; its return will grieve
and disappoint me." Grace took the beautiful
little timekeeper in her hand ; it was something
she should value-but ought she to keep it? Wear
a watch which was a gift from Mr. Lenox, when
she had rejected him! That did not coincide with'
her views of things, and she laid it back in its vel-
vet case. Then she took up the note and re-read it.
Taking in view her whole acquaintance with him,
and its results, was it right to reject this "peace-
offering," as he had termed it? "It is beyond my
power to decide, to-night," thought she; -"I mnust
wait. One thing I do know: it cannot entangle
me as Doctor Allerton's letters have done. It ohly
says 'forget, and be friendly ;' while they are con-

stantly drawing me on with heir charming variety,
all woven up with home and every body I know
there," and she blushed at\ this unexpected con-
fession, as if somebody  ad heard her make it.
Laura had told her ndt to .be gone long, for she
wanted to practice some songs which Henry had
brought. So she put the package and note into her
drawer, and went down to the parlor. Henry gave
her a searching look,.and she wondered how much
he knew pf the contents of the 'parcel. When they
.were alone, she gave the package and the note to
Laura, without .saying a word. When she had
read the' note, and admired. the beautiful gift, she
listened to Grace's "What shall I do?" uttered in
beseeching terms.
" It seems to, me you had better keep it. You
cannot return it at present, for Mr. Lenox has
gone. I know he has suffered very much, from
what He'ry has told me."
"Does e know it ?"
" es."
"I am sorry; but I cannot help it. If-I thought
it would really gratif him, and he could perfectly
understand my moti es, I would keep it. It is
beautiful; and if Ern st had' given it to me, I.
should be in ecstacies over it. How strang it is,
that the thing itself isn't the thing, after all."
"I must repeat the same expression I have so
often used. What a queer girl you are! You
seem so old and so young-all mixed up together.
Sometimes I should think I had your mother for
my room-mate, and then I might believe your little
sistw Mary had ;dropped in. I wonder if there is

any thing in that old house at Beechf rd which
makes people prematurely wise! I am glad you
cannot send this beautiful thing back to-pight, and
I am stronglydisposed to think, in view of all the
circumstances, that you would do wrong to do soat
all. Ask Dr. Allerton. I believe-he is accountable
for some of your strange fancies, ignorant as you,
seem to be of the fact. If he only lived in Bostcn
in time I might learn to forgive him." .
The world went on as usual; only to Grace life
was more serious than it used to be.
Henry Marshall had a long talk with Laura
about his cousin and hers. He could not under-
stand why she had refused him, but he never once
accused her of seeking to mislead him. "She is a
rare treasure," said he, "and' would, I think, have
sufficient influence over Lenox to brink him into
clearer view on some points ;where he is rather
wandering. He is very fastidious in his tastes,
and now I shall not be surprised if ht is never
suited. I hope Grace will keep that watch."
"Then you knew about it ?"
"Yes ; he told me all about it. It se med, after
his first sorrow had passed, to be a decided com-
fort to him to express his continued regard in some
way that might occasionally remind her of him.
He proposed several .things, but nothing suited
him until he saw a watch exactly like. fours. He
could see no objection to this: it would be useful,
and he was sure she could. accept it as a token of
his continued friendship. He sent no chain with
it, on purpose. He designed to have jno links in
any way connected with it. I think sho ought to

the watch. So many advisers ought to help me dc
right in the matter."
One evening, Grace had been sitting in the twi-
light with Henry and Laura, when Ernest came
for her to. go .out to walk. "Poor Lenox," said
Henry, "I seldom see that girl, that I do not wish
it had-been in her power to love him."
"I wish it could have been so," said Laura. " It
is a greater trial, since it is just what we would
have it, if we could arrange it. It is a great dis-
appointment to' father and mother, but they aston-
ish me by their quietness about it. Mother says,
father ,thinks she will change her mind; but I
know she will not. She is a peculiar girl. She is
one of the dearest companions you can imagine.
She has done me a great deal of good. She always
sees things in such a cheerful way. I' tell her
sometimes I believe she was born to conquer diffi-
culties. Right and wrong are very clearly defined in
her mind, and, without seeming to know it, she
brings one to her way of thinking."
"Just the qualities Lenox needed. It is well he
is not your listener. You would destroy all the
effects of his change of scene and stoical determin-
ation. I hope she will be wise enough 'to keep his
watch. I'shall think her lacking in appreciating
circumstances, if she does not."
" I think she has decided to do so, for even Er-
nest did not object."-
"Her brother has decision enough to be your
father's son. I saw that, by the exptession of his
mouth, the first evening .I met him. I like him
much. Are the rest of the family like these two ?"

which the easterly wind rolled up. They were so
grand, that I could not speak a word. I kept
thinking of 'terrible majesty' all of the time. I
cannot explain what I think about it; only I like
certain things in certain places. I enjoy the ease
of my life this summer, and the beautiful drives,

people I meet; and I know how different it is at
home, where we have to be so careful of every
thing, and father and mother have so much to do,
and I have to set the table, and wash dishes, and
sweep-things that you know I do not really like
at all-and yet I am going back to my old life,

can."                                  .1,
"How would it be if father, mother, Annie, the
children and-and their family physician were com-

Grace blushed in spite of herself, and. added:
"Of course, if father and mother and all of the fam-
ily were coming, I should feel very differently. If

w e had always lived here as uncle has, I suppose
I hould wonder how I could be content in Beech-

" Unless-you know you asked me to explain,

to do so-unless Doctor Allerton should write one
o his charming letters and tell you he was very
lonely at Beechford, that he had discovered that

u y of a wealthy -home in Boston would suffer in
comparison with the domestic happiness nestled
away in Beechford."
''Ernest, you are too bad. I shall not accept

w nderfully discerning. Sometimes I think if
mother sends for me this Fall, I will urge her to
le me stay all winter, just to prove how mistaken
y u are."
'That would please us both. I'll keep on ex-
pl ining if you will stay all winter. Now, shall I
tell you something more? I think Mr. Rexford is
very polite to somebody ; he certainly is to me,
an' I never called myself particularly attractive."
'He comes here to sing with us; he has been in

ask her to let you stay all winter. Oh, Grace Win-
throp ! I wonder if all the girls in the world are
like you."
I don't suppose they all have such brothers.
I wish you were going back to Beechford to stay
always. Are you really glad that you have come
here to live ?"
" Yes, I can say I am; for you know I could not
always be a boy and live at home with father and
mother. I must make a home for myself some-
where, and I mean to carry out their principles in
it. I hope I shall be able to say, ' The lines have
fallen unto me in pleasant places ; yea, I have a
goodly heritage."
"That -sounds just like 'mother. You know she
has a passage of Scripture ready for any occasion.
There is one thing here, Ernest, so different from
home; it seems as if people never think of.anything
but this world. When auntie has one of her ter-
rible headaches, 'she always seems so frightened
and asks if headaches do not sometimes kill peo-
ple. Once when I told her of Aunt Mary's dying,
just .as grandmother has told it to me so many
times, she said it did not seem to her possible
that a young girl of e ghteen could be happy at
the thought of dying. She asks me if mother does
not scold and fret when she has .so much to "do,
and how it is possible that we all seem so happy.
One Sunday when she was not well, and I stayed at
home with her, she wanted me to read her some of
the chapters which mother likes." Uncle seems to
respect religion, and he always goes to church; and
here is another thing which I cannot explain, fa-

th r's religion seems himself. Is cannot separate
hin from it, while uncle's seems like our Sunday
clothes at home-the very best things we can have,
but not absolutely necessary to our real comfort
an happiness."
'Uncle came away from home very early. Moth-
er says he had so many temptations in the army,
an his success in business was so uninterrupted,
an  his wealth so abundant, that he had greater
te ptations to 'feed on husks' than father. had in
hi, self-denying life. I do not believe I shall ever
forget the conversation I .had with mother about
.a week before I came away. She made it so plain
that earthly riches were dangerous possessions,
and increased a' man's responsibility so much, that
I am trying to keep to her motto of diligence. 'She
marked this text: 'Seest thou a man diligent in
his business, he shall stand before kings; he shall
not stand before mean men.
"Isn't it strange, Ernest, that the Bible has some-
thing in it for every body's troubles. I think I am
something like uncle. I have the greatest respect
for it, but I never could see how mother could re-
member so many passages that were exactly the
thing you wanted. I remember once when I was
a little girl, she sent me with some broth for old
Bethia Newal, She seemed very glad to see me,
and I thought I would do as I had read about good
peop e doing when they visited the sick, repeat
some comforting passage of Scripture; but the
more I tried the more I could not think of a single
one ; and finally, when she asked me if I could not
tell her a little news to cheer her tup, I asked her

if she knew about 'Joseph and his brethren.' She
did not seem to know who they were, but she liked
the story.
"1This winter when I have been so really troubled
and perplexed, all of a sudden up would come a
text without my looking for it, and it would be
just the thing I needed and make the way seem

you thought I had grown older, and sometimes I
think I have, for I feel so much more responsibility.
than I used to when I knew that father and mother
were thinking for me. I did not, trouble myself
much about anything, but here it is different. I
often find myself questioning the right and wrong
of things which people do and say. I try to throw
it off by saying they are older and a.great deal
wiser than I am,.but that does'not satisfy nie. I
know that mother's views are right and her texts
mean just what they say."
"It would make mother very happy if she knew
that you remember these things. She used to say
last winter, 'Grace is so young and thoughtless,
and so. fond of things which please the eye, that
I'm afraid she will get notions which will hinder
her from being happy in the plain ways she has
been accustomed to. If I only knew that she was
a Christian, I could trust her better.' "
"I am not a Christian, Ernest, I know I am not ;
but my life has been so entirely different from ours
at home, that I. have thought more of the difference
between those who are. Christians ,and those who
are not, than I should in years there, with father
and mother and grandfather and grandmother. I

had no contrasts for them. I thought, if I ever
thought at all, that all "fathers and mothers were
Christians."
"Grace ! where are you ?" said Laura, coming
out to look for her. "Henry has gone and Mrs.
Clark is waiting for you to lock the hot se."
"If I have outstayed Henry," said' Ejnest, rising
quickly, "you must charge it to this cousin of
yours,l who has a way of keeping folks longer than.
they mean to stay. I'll take it off of my next even-
ing," said 'he, laughing, as the girls followed him
to the door and bade him good-night

CHAPTER XIX.
THE BEACH PARTY.
M    R. LENOX had     turned, and Grace had
met him two or, three times. He was kind,
but evidently avoided her. And she, understand-
ing him, managed to keep out of his way.
There was less necessity for their meeting now
than during the winter. He did not call, and there
were no parties to throw them together.
"Mr. Rexford calls oftener than he used to ;
have you thought of it, Grace ?" said Laura, one
day.
"Yes ; and do you know, Laura, that I am getting
to be suspicious, or vain, or something else disagree-
able, because instead of. enjoying 'his society as I
used to last winter, I begin to imagine I shall get
into trouble again. It is dreadful to be suspicious,
Laura.".
"I'm suspicious of Doctor Allerton's letters as
the occasion of a good deal of your trouble. Why
don't you give them up ?'"
Grace blushed, and answered, with some diffi-
culty for her,. "How can I now? Ernest likes
them as well as I do. Annie is so busy, she has n't
time to write-us half we want to know."

"Well, I advise Mr. Rexford not 'waste his
veetness on the desert air.'"
" He shall not, if I can help it," said Grace.,
A long silence followed, in which both girls were
idently thinking. Laura, looking up, saw such
serious expression on her cousin's face, that she
immediately called her to an account for it.
"Taking yourself to task, I always know, when I
e that expression. What have you been doing
ow ?"
"It's what I have n't been doing. I've been con-
asting my life with Annie's. Sometimes I feel so'
le-just as if I was doing nobody any good."
"How glad I am that I feel so well qualified to
nsweri some of your doubts. , In the first place,
ou have been teaching me ever since you came
ere, Do n't look so incredulous, Miss Winthrop !
'he lessons you hare given me I could never have
:arned in any othe way ; and if I should attempt
draw up a set o1 resolutions, you would be as-
nished at their extent."
Grace did look incredulous, forthe idea of being
y real benefit to Laura never came into her
cad ; and that very evening, when Ernest told her

be was where he could tell, her of his perplexities,

ew mode of life, a light seemed to-dawn upon her.

and make friends who would esteem him, and then
he could do without her better. She was sorry
there seemed so little that she could do to show
her affection for her uncle and aunt. She did not
know that her bright, cheerful face, and her thought-
ful anticipations in little acts of dutiful, attention,
made him wish that she might never leave him un-
til she had a home of her own. He had been real-
ly tried in her refusal of Mr. Lenox. If the matter
had been reversed, and she. had fancied some one
whom he disliked,. he would never have kept so
quiet; but he could not see how any interference
on his part would help the state of things.
"That young doctor at Beechford has something
to do with her decision," was his-usual response to
himself, when he thought the matter over. He
made very particular inquiries after him of Ernest,
and found that he held him in high esteem. He
was making his mark, and promising to be a man
of much importance at Beechford. He poped
nothing would be said of Grace's going home for
another year'; perhaps in that time things would
take a different turn.
Mrs. Winthrop had gone beyond loving  race
because her husband and daughter did. She loved
her because she could not help it. Her fingers had
a kind of. magnetic touch which soothed her fre.
quent headaches more than medicine ; anc now
that Laura had so many exclusive demands upon.
her, Grace filled in the vacancy most acceptably.
She thought if her mother should send for her, a
visit would satisfy her, and she would consent to
her returning with them for another year at least.

She 10lt more sure of it now that Ernest was there,
for she knew that he would not be willing to have
her o away, if it was possible to keep her. Grace
had been trained in active usefulness; so that she
did, ot really understand or' rightly estimate the
passive form. There are so many departments in
the great work-shop of life, that it needs time and
severe discipline to open our eyes to the fact that
our a customed way is -only one.of the infinite ways
in which the workman is employed.. We cannot
judg of the importance of our task simply by its
relative position. Grace was standing - on the
thres old, with only. a dim perception of what was
folde up in the leaves she was daily turning.
" 'other told m two years ago that I knew very
little of life," said. he to Laura. "I thought she
had very limited idea of my attainments,.but' I
begi to see'that she was wiser than her daughter.
[ think I have learned something in these two
years Ernest say I seem older than I used to;
but, good-bye, there comes Henry Marshall; if he
s really disappointed at not. finding 'me here,' you
an call me," and lughingly she ci sappeared. In a
ittle time, Laura came for her.
"According to agreement, I am here to find
rou. Henry wishes to see you especially."
"I oppose so," aid Grace, without showing the.
east ign of obeying the summons.
" He does, really I. came on purpose to find you.
If you had been a little less anxious 'to be out of
he way, I should not have had to come up these
ong fights of stairs."
Henry was in the summer-house, which was

built under a broad elm that had been left sta ding
in the enclosed space back of the house.
"My call at this hour was on purpose to see you,
Grace ; but, as usual, you were out of sight. I am
going to get up a beach party, and my first ques-
tion is, what shall I do with you ?"
" If Ernest can go, I will quickly tell you. Will
it do for him to leave his business ?"
"Better not until he has been there lodger.
Laura says you must be talked, over and disposed
of before hand, or you will give us a great deal of
trouble."
"Quite a compliment !" said Grace, laughing.
"I'll stay with aunt, and after dinner ride over to
Charlestown, call and invite Mr. Ernest Winthrop
to tea, and be ready to welcome you home hen*
you-come.".
"Exactly what I said!" responded Laura. 'But
you must* go, Grace; I want you to very much.
We are to go early in the morning, take lunch with
us, and eat it on the rocks. It will be delightful,
if you will only do as.we want you to."
"What do you want me to do.?"
" Go with whoever of Henry's friends ask.you.'
"Not Mr. Lenox! You would not approve of
that, Henry, I am sure."
"No, Grace; Lenox believes in you; he will not
ask you. .I hope he will go;. but if he does, it will
be on horseback. . The truth is, if you are disen-
gaged, Rexford will ask you. He is a'good fellow ;
but if you mean to spare him, I should not advise
you to spend much, time over him. You have
proved yourself such a dangerous companmo, that

and if [ tell him first of the party, he will have the
a van age of Rexfo d, and I think you will find him
a agreeable companion. I can recommend him.
Will ybu go with hi ?"
"Say, 'Yes,' before he asks me-is that what you
ean  y doing what you want to have me ?" said
Grace, laughing.
" No,.my lady, not at all. I know what I am talk-
i g about. Will your go with Russell if he asks
you?"
" Yes, to please you and Laura I will, if you
will promise not to say to him, I de n't exactly
know   hat to do wit Grace Winthrop. I suppose
,Laura and I can tak her.' But remember, I 'shall
not go with Mr. Rexford, and I shall not be unhap-
py to tay ,at'home. Please, can- I go now, Mr.
Marshall?" and Grace assumed an air of mock hu-
mility quite ridiculous to behold.
"I must, if you do not; remember you are to
leave your fate in my hands, so far as this party is
concerned."
" Yes, sir," said Grace, making a low' courtesy,
and then she was gone back to her room, where
.Laura soon joined her,-and their talk and work
went on uninterruptedly for the rest of the morn-
ing.
The party was arranged for the last day of Au-
gust. M~[r. Russell's early invitation was accepted.
Mr. Re ford' came as soon as he heard of it, and
seemed decidedly surprised that somebody had
secured Miss Winthrop before him. He declined

going entirely, but Henry Marshall ignorin the
fact, that he cared particularly for any young lady,
urged him to make some other arrangement  He
must not stay at home for they could not spare
him.
Six o'clock is a very pleasant hour to start on a
long ride of a warm summer morning.     rnest
longri   ff nd oinGrac inthewish
came up to see them off and join was a verypleash
that he was going. Mr. Russell waavey Pleas-
ant companiongand the whole party were in excel-
lent spirits. Without driving fast they rached
Lynn before nine o'clock, and after resting at hour
were ready to drive to the beach. Here they stroll-
ed about, watching the play of the good-ntured
waves. They climbed the rocks and found sats as
they could in groups or single companies. Every
body had come for a pleasant day, so they wer social
and merry, enjoying the refreshing breeze . Mr.
Lenox came much later than the rest, and as Henry
Marshall had predicted, he was on horsebac. He
was cheerful, but not a leading spirit, as he once
would have been. He joined the group where
Grace was sitting, and occasionally addressed a
Grark was her nce he asked her about her broth-
er and of his success in his business, but he offered

Lunch was in thiscase really an enterta nment,
for it not only ministered to their appetites, but its
arranging nd serving furnished a good  eal of
amusement    Cold, roast chickens were plenty,
and sandwiches and a variety of cake and fruit.
Each carriage had a basket, and altogether the

good things would have been sufficient for a party
of twige their number.
The repast occupied some time, and then Lizzie
Marshall proposed to explore among .the rocky
cliffs. Grace joined her, and in ashort time all of
the party were in motion. Grace was very inde-
pendent in her efforts, climbing rocks was no new
thing for her, it really was very exhilarating; and
brought a glow on her cheeks such as they used to
wear at Beechford. She was quite in advance of
the others and thought she was a one, making a
bold effort to go round a point she missed her foot--
hold and would have fallen if a str ng hand had
not caught her, and held her firmly until she stood
in safety. It was Mr. Lenox. She had come into
his .lonely retreat very unexpectedly. ~His sur-
prise, and her sudden danger, threw him off his
guard, and caused him to utter an expression of
passionate tenderness. His quick apology had
something so painful in it, that as he turned away
and left her with Mr. Russell, she realized how man-
fully he had striven to 'keep his pledge, and be to
her only.a friend.
Henry Marshall and Laur coming up just then,
found Mr. Russell and several others assiduous in
their inquiries after Grace, who was sitting, unusu-
ally, pale, but very quiet, on the rock.
"Your cousin, Miss Winthrop, came very near
paying dearly for -her independence. She is in-
debted .to. Mr. Lenox's sudden appearance from
somewhere for her ability to look .so composedly
over it now. She so outstripped me;-in, the race
that I could render her- no assistance."

Laura looked alarmed, but Grace assured, her
that she did not fall, only a stone rolled and  ade.
her lose her footing, she was not hurt in the le st.
"I shall have to put an injunction on    iss
Grace, to the effect that she shall stay d wn
where the rest of us mortals do for the remai der
of the day," said Henry Marshall, with an ai of
assumed authority. " I also propose that we ave
a little music on this festive occasion, provid d I
can get our forces together."
Grace would rather have sat awhile in sil nce
waiting for the shock, and the expression of Mr..
Lenox's face, to pass away; but with her sual
effort at self-command, she joined her voice vith
the others. Mr. Lenox's part was wanting and
there was'a general call for him, but he had disap-
peared, and they were obliged to go on without
him.
The waves sang, too, regardless of the tiny
sounds on shore ; the world was wide enoug  for
both. By and sby the horses were brought an the
party rode slowly up and down the wonde fully
beautiful beach, watching the declining sun as it
poured its farewell flood of golden radiance all
over, the unmindful waters. The hard san  had
retained sufficient water to give it the appearance
of a high polish, and the tread of the horse was
so soft, that they might have be n shod wit vel-
vet for any sound they gave. G ace took i the
beautiful outline with its varied sc nery from  each
to lofty precipice, with intense longings for rnest
to share in, er enjoyment of it. She was in no
mood to express to Mr. Russell the half she felt,

so she kept reasonably silent:. The ride liome was
very pleasant, the m on supplying the sun's place
most acceptably.
Grace's accidenta encounter with Mr. Lenox
had been her greater t drawback in the pleasures
of the day. He di not join the company any
more. His cousin c vered his retreat, by saying,
"He was an uncerta n guest, and had only prom-
ised to ride out'and lok on awhile."
Ernest was waitin for them, and listened with
interest to Grace's d scription of the excursion.

Grace knew that Ler mother really needed her,
especially. if Annie was going. It was a great trial
to leave Ernest, butl her mother .knew that, and
. would not separate them if she cojild help it.
The evening before Annie's letter came Mr..
Rexford had found. an opportunity to convey to
Grace in language sh could neither misunderstand
nor evade his life pla for her.
The interview, on her part, was less painful than
the one with Mr. Lenox, because she had never
come so near loving him; but, with the feelings
of a true woman, she was pained to be tlle cause
of disappointment and sorrow to one who so earn-
estly offered her his ichest gifts. She had never
given him reason to s pposeashe liked him beyond
a .pleasant friend,. and when she grew conscious
that he was advancing farther than this she had
withdrawn, sometimes almost to coldness.
"Another friend lost," said she, in answer to
Laura's inquiries. "I am glad I am sure of Ernest
and Henry Marshall."
Her mother's desire for her to come home seemed
an outlet for the troubles she had so unintentionally
encountered.
Related to Henry Marshall and Laura, as she and
Mr. Lenox were, they must meet occasionally, and
when winter came it would be impossible to avoid
meeting often. Every thing would be changed.
Mr. Rexford belonged to their musical set and to
all their social gatherings. It would be impossible
to get back the old, careless friendship  New

seemed strange that in one short year she should
have become so much at home in her uncle's
family and have so many pleasant friends who re-
gretted he going. Mrs. Winthrop felt personally
aggrieved she did not trysto be reconciled to it.
Ernest made the. best of it, but he dreaded the
vacancy which her going would leave. The last
of October Mr. Olcott, Colonel Winthrop's friend,'
came, and willingly promised to see his young
charge in safety until she met her father.
. The little trunk was brought down from the
attic, but its owner's wealth had so outgrown .its
size that the large one Mrs. Winthrop had brought
from New York had to take its place.
"Shall I take these handsome evening dresses,
aunt ?" said she, as she thoughtfully surveyed
them, and remembered that they would be rather
out of place in their little .social gatherings at
Beechford.
"Yes, child, take every thing; they will be old-
fashioned when you come back next winter. You
will want new ones then."
It seemed to Grace that her wardrobe was very
extensive. She thought her mother and Annie
would think so too.
" Here is something for Annie," saii Mrs. Win.
throp, handing her a parcel. "Tell her I do:not
like her getting married and taking you away ;
but I will forgive her enough to send-Fer this."
It was a silver-gray silk with the necessary trim.
mings, and Grace added it ,to her store with great
pleasure.

wished he had never come to Beechford. It would
have been a great relief to her burdened mind to
pour out a torrent of wrathful words on his far off
head just at that moment, but she was perfectly
conscious that it would not do a particle of good,
so he at once smothered it down and busied her-
self with her cousin's trunk until she grew cheerful
again.
" I cannot wear this to-night; uncle would notice
it, and I could never explain 'it to him. I hope
you will tell Henry that I appreciate his beautiful
gift. I shall wear the watch with more pleasure
for his association with it."
The last evening brought a good many calls.
Mr. Lenox was among. the number, but Mr. Rex-
ford was not. Mr. Lenox only staid a few mo-
ments, but he. seemed cheerful, and told her good.-
bye so kindly, that it vas pleasant to remember.
She was glad he came; it seemed to quiet the
painful recollection she had of her meeting hi  at
Nahant. Colonel Winthrop spoke of her going as.
of a visit she was making. ° "'If, nothing happens,
I shall come. for you next year," he said.
Ernest caught at this, idea, and wore a. more
cheerful face than he had, for several days. As he
was leaving for the night, his uncle said; " I saw
Mr. Hillard this afternoon, and asked him to give
you a holiday to-morrow. I want you'to drive
about twenty miles from here with this young lady.
Her baggage will go with Mr. Olcott, by the stage,
and you can see her safely on board."
This thoughtful kindness on the part of his uncle
was so unexpected, that Ernest said goo-night

with almost as light a heart as if h had been go--
ing all the way.
The November sun strove to gladden the earth
and give a cheerful look to the stirring city, as Er-.
nest and Grace once more drove cut of it. The
parting was past; her going was regretted in the
household, from her uncle down t Ralph. This
ride with Ernest was a great help to them both.
There was so much to say, that the were in dan-
ger of being behind the stage-hour. Grace looked
at her watdh, which she wore for the first time to-
day, and found it was necessary t drive a little
faster. Ernest had messages for is father and
mother, Annie and all the rest, not forgetting Doc-
tor Allerton. They reached the appointed place,
a little in advance of the stage-coach. Mr. Olcott
and the trunks were both along with it. The
horses were changed, the horn blew, and Ernest
saw his sis er seated, and watched the wave of her
handkerchief until the vehicle was out of sight.
With a lonely heart he turned away and drove
back to Boston. This sister's love had been one
of the strong daily influences of his life. How
would he get on without it now? It was a slight
hope that she might come back the next year. He
tried to shut out the thought that he should never
again belong to the home circle as one of its daily
members. He must work on manfully. He had
a place to ill, and he would not lse strength in
useless regrets. So, with thankful memories for
the treasures he had in such safe keeping, he went
back to his duties. He had no fe:r of being for-
gotten in ~he welcome which would be extended

CHAPTER       XX.
B EECHFORD AGA I.I-
MR. OLCOTT proved himself an excellent
traveling companion. He was about Colo-
nel Winthrp's age, and had daughters older and
younger than Grace. Without naay delays, the
lumbering old stage-coach, the da it was due,
drove up. to the little inn at A  . The first
face Grace saw was her father's. That dear face!
how it beamed upon her, aid how tha hand clasped
hers as it helped her from her seat ! Let those who
have known a loving father's welcome understand
how glad lher heart was. In a few moments, who
should appear but Charles and Henry, grown taller,
but smiling all over their happy faces!
"I should think I had got hom," said Grace.
"Did anybody else come with you ?'
"No," said her father.  "Arthur and Mary
wanted to. It would not have take much to have
brought your mother and Annie, too ; but I thought
four would be enough for one wagon."
'Grace remembered to introduce her father to
Mr. Olcott. He joined her in thanking him for his
kindness, b the way, and then the tage rode off.

"Is that big trunk you 's, Grace ?" said Charles,
looking in amazement at the large one which the
driver had set down beside the small one.
Yes."
"Whew !" says he. "They have big things in
Boston, don't they ? What have you got in it ?"
The boys .soon drove Fearnaught and Caesar
round to the door, and, with their father's help,
lifted the trunks into the wagon. They were very
anxious to be on their way. They had so many
questions to ask, they wanted their sister all to
themselves.
Deacon Winthrop had, of course, much to in-
quire about her journey and of Ernest.
The twenty miles were soon passed over. As
the early twilight deepened into night, the '"oid
house at home" came full in view.
" Please stop at the corner of the garden, father,
and let Grace go in -by herself," said Charles.
Grace was quickly out of the wagon. and open-
ing the gate, without making any noise, she went
into the porch, and looked in the little window by
the side of the door. Her mother and Annie were
sitting . before the fire, in quiet expectancy, while
Arthur and Mary had' gone to the window, for per-
haps the tenth time in the' last five minutes. She
lifted the latch,  and in a moment her arms were
about her mother's neck.
"Gracel my. dear child, have you indeed co e !"
Then the mother cast a longing look beyond her,
as if Ernest must not be far away:,. Annie, Arthur
and Mary all gathered round her, full' of rejoic
ings. Deacon Winthrop and the two boys came

in to see how she really looked a

Nobody tells us any stories now, for mother and
Annie never have any time."
"Tea is ready," said Charles, and the announce-
ment wasfolloweci by a general gathering into the
warm kitchen.
"It does not loo much like your uncle's dining-
room," said Mrs. Winthrop.
"It looks very much like my ,old home," laid
Grace, "and you look very much ,like the dear
good mother I have always seen sitting at the head
of the table."
There was a hush, and from the earthly father's
heart there went up to the heavenly Father a sim-
ple petition for a. renewed blessing on every fresh
token of His love. Grace had heard nothing like-
it since she left that table morethan a year ago.
"Ernest's seat seems very empty to-night," said.
Mrs. Winthrop; "it seemed as if he must be com-
ing with you, Grace."
" I think mother is almost as much disappointed
as if he had not come home with you two years
ago," said Annie, trying to be cheerful over it. 'I
am so glad to get one of you back that I feel like
rejoicing."
"So do I," said Mrs. Winthrop. "I am; sure
Grace knows that well enough."
Just as the tea was over, Aunt Loi slowly o en-
ed the kitchen door and looked cautiously in.
Grace saw her in a moment, and welcomed her as
cordially as her kind heart could desire.
"Wall, you've come, and I'm about as glad as I
know how to be. I told Nannie that I must run
over if it was dark. She's'got a dreadful cold, and

her lap. .Arthur stood by her side and Charles and
Henry sat on each side of her. It seemed so. ex-
actly like the scene two years\ ago, when she and
Ernest came from Boston, that Grace felt strangely
lonely; but she cheered herself and them by telling
all about his coming to her uncle's; of his success,
and her uncle's satisfaction in finding how well he
pleased his employers. She had a very attentive
audience,,for the letters had told so little compared
with their wish to know so much of all that con-
cerned him.
Though Grace was talking, she had time to look
about her; it seemed strange that the rooms had
grown so small and the ceilings so low. She was
lure they could not always have been so, and yet
everything was just as she had left it. Her moth-
er's face, in the fpint light which fell upon it, looked
weary and care-worn, and she felt th t it would
have been wrong for her to have stayed away when
she might lighten some of the burdens at home.
Her father looked quietly glad, and the children
seemed so deligl ted to see her that she knew they
must have missed her sadly.
"Well," said Deacon Winthrop, as the clock
struck ten, "we are no nearer through being glad
to see Grace, or coming to the end of her stories,
than we were when she first came in, so I propose
we shall go to bed and.take a fresh day for the
rest."
Charles had taken Ernest's place in. reading the
chapter, and when Grace heard her father's prayer
for the absent brother, she realized how fervently
she had been remembered all the days she had

b'en. away. She went up to her room, so plain,
c spared to the one she had occupied the past
year, impressed with the feelings that her father
and mother were very dear possessions, and that
their presence in the old house would make up for
t1 e lack of beauty there. Her mother's weary face
tro ubled her, and she waited for Annie to come to
ask if she was well.
"Yes," said Annie; " but I think she has had too
much to do all summer. When we talked of your
coming home, and uncle wrote that letter, she
hardy knew what to say. She really needed you
so much, and yet she was sorry to send for you,
whe they were all so unwilling to have you come,
especially when your coming would leave Ernest
alone."
"You mean especially when you were going to
run away and leave her. I don't know as I shall

"Did Ernest, tell you I was going ?".
"Yes; I do not want you to go, Annie; I shall

"I thought you would bestised to it by this time.
What is this ?" said she, suddenly attracted by the
glitter of the chain which' had -been concealed By
her dress. Grace took it from her, neck and placed
it and the watch in her sister's hand.
" Is this yours?" and "Who gave it to you ?"
were questions which quickly followed each other.
" It is mine, Annie, and some time I will, tell you
all about it, I must tell you and mother, for I can-

Mary made up her lost opportunity by waking
very early in the morning. She had a'great many
things ,to tell her sister ; among others, that she
met Doctor Allerton the afternoon before and told
him that father and the boys had gone for her.
" He and I are great friends," said she. Annie
looked in to see if they were awake. "Must I
come down and set the table ?" said Grace, laugh-.
ing.
If you are ready' to come down when it is ret,
we will excuse you from anything else this morn-
ing," said Annie.
Grace was ready and received .a most hearty
welcome as she toolk her old place. "I must go
up. and see grandfather and grandmother this
morning," said she. 1                  .
" Before you open your big trunk? I was going
to stay at home from school on purpose to see
what is in it," said Mary, looking very much dis-
appointed.
"Perhaps mother will let you go with me to
grandfather's, and that will do as well, won't it ?"-
Mary's face bright tened ; she was ready 'to ac-
company her sister on her. morning visit. The
first thing was to look into the little brown house
and say, 4"How do-do," to the loving old inmates.
Aunt Nannie seemed more feeble, but Aunt Lois
said it was only her dreadful cold ; she would get
well right away when she saw Grace sitting in her
old corner again. " Nobody knows how we've
missed you," said she ; " I had n't no heart for any
thing last spring. Mary, here, set away with me
to gather wild flowers, but she soon got tired of it,

FIFTY YEARS AGO.           28.1
and my pinks and sweet Williams and roses hung
on for days with nobody to make urn into flower-
pots. I told Nannie last. night that I was dreadful
'fraid I should ear by and by that somebody was
coming to take ou back to Boston to live."
"No, Aunt Lois," said Grace, "I shave come
back to help yo  'look after things.' You need
not be afraid of losing me-it is Annie we are go-
ing to lose. Mother and you could not spare us
both."
Aunt Lois wa a little comforted, but she could
not quite believe, a she told Nannie, that Boston
folks would let such  beautiful " garl" as that come
back to Beechford if they could help it.
Grace found er grandfather and grandmother
looking not a day older than when she left'them.,
The same restful, sunny old people, waiting for the
ummnons which would transplant them to their
heavenly home.
They were delighted to see their granddaughter,
and had many questions to ask after Ernest. "We
miss the dear boy," said the old gentleman, wip-
ing hid eyes. "I wish he could have found some
thing to, do nearer home, but it does me good to
see your face again. I was afraid, from what they
told me, that your uncle would think he had a
right to you."
"Your mother has missed you, my child," said
her grandmother, "and I am glad you have come
back to her."
The visit lasted until after dinner, and then, with
blithe little lMary for her companion, she wenit
back through the same path she so well remem


bered the day before she left home. The' walec
and the call had done her good.
The trunks were opened, and Mary's wonder-
ing eyes feasted or their contents. Ahnie was
very much' pleased  ith her. dress. "It is some-
thing I needed, but ever thought of having," said
she.
Mary's remark's over her sister's dresses were.
most original and amusing. She was sure nobody
in the world ever looked half, so pretty as she
must have done in these beautiful things.
Grace folded and carefully laid away her white
silk, her pink crape and her soft, India muslins-
they already began to seem to her things of the
*past. . Then, she produced the garments she had
made for Annie.
"A whole set ! Why, Grace, such unexpected
riches. will turn mf head !" and she sat down,
hardly knowing whether to laugh or to cry.
"You must thank Aunt Winthrop a d Laura. I
nly made them; it as one of my greatest pleas-
res last winter. Here is Ernest's gift. He told
e to tell you he had had only one payment, so he
ould not buy just What he wanted to"
Annie untied the package and found a beautiful
collar and a pair ofwhite gloves. '1 And here is
omething to pin ypur collar with f om Laura ;"
nd Grace handed her a little box containing a
yery pretty breast-pin, the like of which Annie had
never owned.
"Do call mother, Mary," said Annie. '"I am
so overpowered with my sudden wealth that I can-
not xnve."

Mother came, and smiled, in, her loving way, to
see her daughters so happy.
Mary had some useful remembrances, too. Her
heart was bubbling over in its joy. First it was
Grace, then it was her beautiful clothes, then it
was Annie's fine things, then it was her own.
It took Grace some weeks to get back into her
old routine of home duties. Sometimes they seem-
ed wearisome to her, but her love for her home
and friends helped her over these points; and, as
her old interests came back, she entered on her
daily life with increasing desire to meet the de-
mands upon.her.
The second evening after ,her return she came
into the sitting -room and found Doctor Allerton
there talking with her father. She was conscious
of blushing deeply at this unexpected 'meeting,
and making a wrong answer to his pleasant greet-
ing, but he did not seem to notice it, He was self-
possessed as usual. He placed a chair for her near
the fire, and began asking her of her journey and
of Ernest.
The mention of Ernest seemed to restore her
quiet tone of thoughts. She delivered, his mes-
sage, and spoke of her regret at leaving him.
Then followed'a pleasant conversation, easily main-
tained. She did not feel afraid of him, neither did
he seem so near her father's age as she had im-
agined him to be. His easy flow of choice lan-
guage had not, in the least, diminished; and, on
the whole, she passed the first dreaded interview
with less embarrassment than she had anticipated.
His letters seemed to her iiow a part of her Bos-

ton life ; he made o allusions to the , and but for
the fact that, in s me way, she un erstood and
appreciated him m re than she used o, she would
almost have believed 'that they had never been
written.
Annie expressed astonishment at er sociability
with Doctor Allert n. She really belieyed she had
grown older since she had been, away. So all of
her friends said-nit less cheerful, but more digni-
fied and womanly:
The year had, indeed, been an evbntfuil one to
her ; one-in which 'er character had developed rap-
idly. Charles persisted in saying that she had grown
handsome, and nore of her friends  ere disposed
to contradict him.  Charlie Thorn and Edward
Nelson declared that she had grow  just a little
haughty, but that was only because they did not
understand the change.
She was no longer the light-hearted, thoughtless
girl they had known all of their lives but she was
justas good a friend.  Sandford ,oss playfully
told her that it was Annie's mantle of eldest daugh-
tership falling on her that impressed er so much.
She found the old church as muc changed as
her father's house. It had grown so small and
plain. It seemed to her, as shesat n her seat in
the choir, that one could almost shake hands across
the galleries.
Her good, common sense, made her keep all of

and she, " a natural branch," was soon at home in
her "own olive-tree," realizing where her love. and
duty lay. She told her mother and Annie the
story of the watch. She could not wear it until.
she had dole this. Mrs. Winthrop was heartily
sorry for Mr. Lenox, but glad her daughter had
come back to her.
"I did not tell any body all the fears I had," said
she. "If I had not been so afraid of loping you, I
should have borne your absence better, but it has
all come out right in the end."
Grace did not mention Mr. Rexford, it was not
necessary, neither had she told them of her corres-
pondence with Doctor Allerton. She knew .how
highly her- father aid mother esteemed him, and
that he had done nothing of which they would
not approve. Perhaps that was all past now, and,
if it as, silence was its best keeper.
The days were very busy ones, and Grace rmiss-
ed Ernest every-where. Thanksgiving carne and
went-a good, old festival, though Ernest was.not
in it. Doctor Allerton spent the.evening at Deacon
Winthrop's, and seemed quite at home in the
family. His manner to Grace was deferential and
friendly,-but nothing more.
In writing to Ernest, she said, "Your friend
Doctor Allerton was very polite' to mother, and
made many inquiries about you. He treats me as
if I was a strange lady-some distant connection
of the family. I thought I might feel sorry for the
obligation our correspondence would almost insen..
sibly impose, but I might have spared myself, for
he has evidently forgotten it."          ;

Aunt Lois always had a way of -answering her

cheerful when the time to need it came."Be-

Grace had got some new 'deas which she could

very happy in all the comm tion. It was just the
thing to brinback her old spirits and make, her

mother's dishes and spoons were on duty, and her
bright brass candlesticks, too. She had sent half a
box of her nicest tallow candles, made on purpose
for this occasion, and Grace had disposed ofther
with an eye to effect. Aunt Lois had brought
over a basket of dishes, out of a closet she ,seldom
opened, except to brush away the dust, and Julia
Thorn and Mary Ross had contributed from their
households. They had also helped Grace tie ever-
green wreaths for the walls and mirrors, and over
the- high mantel-shelves. The new striped carpet,
which Mrs.. Winthrop and Annie, with the help -of
Aunt Nannie and Aunt Lois, had made duringtghe
year, -h~d been .put on the .sittingeroom floor, and

The bride was dressed and waiting., Her silver-
rey silk was very becoming. Ernest's gift of col-
ar and gloves, and Laura's pin, were just what-she
eeded. Like Grace, she had soft, abundant hair.

Mary wore her crimson dress, and felt very..con-

Grandfather and grandmother came early, 'and
were seated in state in the- warmest corner.
Charles and Henry were charged with opening
the doors, snuffing the candles, and arious other
important small things.' Aunt Nan ie and Aunt
Lois took possession of the kitchen, ith most reli-
able intent to respond fully to the various demands
upon its resources. The man who was Deacon.
Winthrop's principal help. on the arm had the
fires in charge, and another man, ho was often
employed as a day-laborer, was instructed to help
look-after the horses at the door. And now every

they knew he would not come.. So Mrs. Winthrop,

face both: sad and glad, went into the spare-room

She thought of it after she got home that night,.
and wondered'if he had forgotten whit he told her
the afternoon before she went away. He. must
have changed his mind now, for le had never
alluded to it, or even to the letters. She had met
him quite often during the winter, 1ut, save for a
consciousness she always had that he knew she
was present, and' from some quiet anticipation of
her wishes, she felt that they were more strangers'
than they had been during her absence.
She never joined the girls in their laughing sur-
mises about him. She seemed not to hear them.
She knew that he was a general fa yorite, but the
impression seemed to be that he was more devoted
to his profession, and the interests of education,
than to, any lady in particular. Well, why should
she care? She certainly had no claims on his par-.
ticular attention. She had fled from  is unexpected
declaration, and refused to be mote than a very
indifferent friend.  She wished s ,,e had never
consented to correspond with him for then she
should never have cared whethe he spoke to
her or. not. Cared for him! .Wh  said she did
care .for him, with his grand indiference?  She
was sure she did not. If she could only have
loved Mr. Lenox, she would hav   shown how
little' she cared, for him! .But thai was all past,.
and she had enough to fill up every moment
of her life. She would try to be to her mother all
that Annie had been, and forget the range reams
which had disturbed her for the last. two years.
She. could not go back to Boston, however much
they might want her. Mother and the boys need-

ed her more -than any body else ; and, with an at-
tempt at cheerful resignation, she at last fell
asleep.
The first few months after Annie's wedding
seeme very strange at the old mansion. She had
never een from home many days-at once; it seem-
ed as i she must come back and fill her accustom-
ed plage, but the household moved on. Aunt Lois
said Grace was as "spry about the house as. she
used to be climbing rocks."  Her mother often
commended her for her helpful ways. The boys
were rowing more helpful, too. Charles had be-
come o accustomed to answer his mother's calls
while  race was away, that he fitted in very nicely.
He wa a great comfort to.his sister; he was so
compa ionable, and her influence over him showed
itself i" many little refining ways. Henry had a
decided taste for study, and found in Doctor Al-
lerton an encouraging and helpful friend. Mary
was very fond of her sister. She missed Annie,
and had never half forgiven Sandford Ross for tak-
ing he away; but she comforted herself by saying
uncle ould never take Grace to Boston any more.
Ernest and Laura wrote occasionally, so that she
was to erably well informed of what was going on
in thei circle. She never read to her r other the
portion s of Laura's letters 'whichspoke of her com-

of pleasure, and Sandford Ross, with his kind
brotherly ways,. added to her list of real friends.
She was quietly happy and' very busy, more
thoughtful than .when we first met her three years
before. She had had much occasio 'for thinking
in these three years, and its results were written in
the sweet expression of her beautiful face.
"Grace has grown so womanly,' her mother
would say to Annie. " I used to think she would
never care-for anything serious,.like plain house-,
hold ways. I expected when she went to Boston
things there would be so much to her mind that she
would never care to come home to live again. We
can't always tell, but I should have expected she
would 'have found in that Mr. Len x the very'
things to please her. Sometimes I think now that,
she is a little too sober for her, and yet I can't think
anything really troubles her."
"Oh, no !" said Annie, Et she is always very cheer-
ful when'I see her. She misses Ernest, and I sip-.
pose has not got quite accustomed o being' the
eldest at home. I do not believe she egrets leav-
ing Boston."
" It's home where the heart is,' you know, moth-
er, and I do not believe Grace's heart is in Boston."
Mrs. Winthrop was so accustomed to counsel
with her eldest daughter, that she still clung to
her, and often sent for her to come and spend the
day when she was more than usually oppressed.
Thus the world moved on until June. The day
had been lovely; every unfolded leaf and bud had
waved a perfume in the quiet air. The birds had
warbled volumes of sweet melodies, and now in

"No,'' said Mrs. Winthrop; ".Grace can go if
she chooses."
"I really see no good reason for excusing you,"
said he, turning to Grace and extending his hand
as if to help her rise. "While you get your shawl
and bonnet, I will show your mother what a com-
fortable carriage we have."
So I'm to- ride when his lordship condescends
to ask me, thought Grace, as she gathered up her
things by the moonlight which streamed into her
window. "I wonder I care to go." She did not
hurry'; she, came slowly. down-stairs and -lingered
in the porch, not long, for Doctor Allerton came
quickly, and with a protecting care quite unnecep-
sary, considering th;e shortness and security of the
way, led her to the carriage.
"I wish I 'was going," said Mary. " Isn't there
room for me, Doctor, if mother will let me go ?"
"Some other time I will take you," said Doctor
Allerton, and with a cheerful good-bye they rode
away.
Yoi and I, dear reader, have 'certain invisible
privileges; if we chose we might go with Doctor
Allerton on his moonlight ride; but we think they
have a right to enjoy it entirely' to themselves;.
only we cannot help knowing that the horse went
very slowly on his way to the lake ; that the moon-
beams fell on the rippling waters very beautifully,
but all unheeded by the occupants of the new gig;
and that the new gig itself might have been only
ah ordinary wagon for any special notice it'g-ot after
its first starting. But the ride -marked a new era
in the lives of Hugh Allerton and Grace Winthrop.

she could rest- when her footsteps were weary.
this:time .her heart responded to its call" s truly.
as it phad grown. sill and heavy when Mr Lenox
sought to win it.
It' was late when the new gig brought th riders
back to the gate under the elm tree. After seeing
Grace. safely within the unfastened. door, Doctor
Allerton, with a rejoicing heart, drove' on to his
home. He drore slowly still, for he was glad to
be out in the air, he wanted all the spac9 about
him to expand his thoughts and take in his new

D acon and Mrs. Winthrop consented to, give
hei daughter to Doctor Allerton more willingly
han they would have done to any body else.
In her .-heart, Mrs. Winthrop wanted, to keep

good people of Beechford, by a series of gradual'
convictions. Nobody wondered that Doctcr Aller-
ton should fancy so lovely a girl as Grace Win-
throp; and, after the usual adjusting of the affair
i, the public mind'it came to be an accepte thing.
Of course, this settled the question of her next year
in Boston.
During the sumner, she wrote to Lauraof her
new' plans, leaving her to see that it would be im-
possible for her to- go home with them n Sep-
tember, and asking her to tell her father and
mother so.
Laura's congratulations were mingled wit many
regrets. "I had so set my heart on having you
here next winter," she wrote, " that I can hardly
forgive Doctor Allerton for interfering w th my
arrangements. I wanted you for my ride's-.
maid and my chief counsellor in many things.
How can I consent to your engagement ! Father
looks blank, and mother is ready to cry over it-
they-felt so sure of you to fill my place for  time,
at least.. Father says he shall not go to Beech-
ford in September, for, as mother continues not
strong, she will not be able to accompany s, and
hi'principal object was to bring you hom. He
says, in his decided way, 'Doctor Allerton i a fine
man, I liked him very r uch, but we    anted
Grace in Boston.' Henry says this accounts for
ydur indifference to good people in general ; and,

Dodtor Allerton smiled very quietly over this
tter, which Grace gave him to read. He remem-
ered when her going had been to him the cause
hidden pain, and her knowledge of the fact had
nly made her the more glad to go. Now his ex-
ressed wish would detain her willingly; and with
glad feeling of conscious power he left her to
nsole her cousin as best she might.
Ern st received the tidings with real pleasure.
s he ecame acquainted with other men, his' re-
ect for Doctor Allerton increased. It was a sor-
Dw to give up the hope of seeing his sister in
oston the next winter ; but he was not sure that
is mother would have consented to her coming
yen if no new causes had detained her.
Charles wrote him a comical description of
Weirr mother's consternation- when she found that
[e must give up her second daughter.   "She
kes Doctor Allerton too much to make any real

" Well, Grace," said her grandfather, when, in
process of time, he learned the fact of her engage-
ment, "I am glad to hear this. I have always liked
Doctor Allerton, and I have always thought he
liked you. I'm glad you did not find any body out
to Boston. I used to tell your grandmother that
I was afraid you would have such a notion for
riches that you would 'never want to come back
to us again. I tell you what, child ! when any
body is as near the end o life as I am, it is pretty
plain what is worth living for. Doctor Allerton is
an excellent young man, and I hope you will make
as good a wife as your mother and grandmother r
have done."

dents unrecorded. Laura's bridal festivities

inthrop urged Mr. and Mrs. Marshall's remain-

eling unwilling to leave her mother, alone until
le grew stronger.
Grace had found each day full of occupation.
he had endeavored to lighten her mother's tasks,
nd her mother had managed to. leave her-many
interrupted hours. in which she could ply her
usy needle in her own service. She had ,found
pleasure in ,Doctor i Allerton's companionship
which gave promise of a happy future.    He
rought her .as many books as she -had 'time to
"ad; and some delightful . rides she took in that

faithfulness.
Julia Thorn and Edward Nelson were looking
forward to a united home some day, so the girls
had a new link of sympathy between them.
Aunt Nannie's spring bleaching exceeded all her'
former efforts. She and Aunt Lois were very
much pleased with the' idea of Grace's marrying
Doctor Allerton..- He. had grown to be quite an
oracle with "hem, and they wanted her to have
what they called a nice outfit.
" Lois," said Aunt Nannie, one day, as she sat
by her "chest of draw" carefully looking them
over, "here's a pair of my fine linen sheets. I spun
them before Grace was born. They are as handsome
sheets a§ you'll see any where, and as white asi
snow. I never used them a dozen titnes in my
life, and 'taint likely I shall ever want them. I'm
a good mind to give them to Grace-she'll set
store gy them."
"So she will," said Aunt Lois, "and you've
plenty to last without them. I thought I'd look
up a couple of pair of mi e ; we've got more than
e shall use,_and I want to give her something to
remember me by, dear Ghild." And Aunt Lois
wiped away the tears which would come.
Again' the old mansio$ gives tokens of some
coming event.,
It is a lovely morning in the latter part of June;.
the doors and windows are -'all open; beautiful
bunches of fragrant roses are on the shelves and on
the .tables;'\and ini the fire-places in the "spare
room" and sitting-room  re the old familiar jars

anhoo4; he is chatting familiarly with his father

and t.ken his seat with them. Annie is up-stairs

she puts the finishing rose-buds, all dewy and

at Annie, who is seldom moved to enthusiasm,
ters expressions of affectionate admiration over

smoothed the folds of he dress as if she wou d ex-
press to it her fondness for the wearer.
There was a fluttering in and out of white
dresses. Julia Thorn and Mary Ross had been
there all the morning arranging flowers and as-
sisting generally ; they'had been dressing, too, and
were now joining Annie. and Mary in surveying
the bride..
Grandfather and grandmother had comelooking
quietly happy. " I did n t expect to wait for this
wedding," said the dear o! d gentleman. "I feel as
young as I did when I ca e to see Sandford carry
away Annie. I cannot  xpect to be here when
little Mary goes; but the Lord knows best and I
must bide my time."
The .guests were now arriving fast, until in a
short time every body had come. Ernest conc uct-
e  Doctor Allerton to his fair bride. As he ook
her hand and looked into her deep blue eyes, so'
tender and womanly in their uplifting to his, hat
wonder is it if his proud, thankful heart was ful1 of
unspoken happiness! She was to be his cornan-
iort until death should part them ; he had toiled to
win, but this hour repaid it all. In a few moments
they. were standing between the two windows in
the spare room listening to Mr. Wilson. as he asked
God's blessing on their coming vows. Then the
words were spoken which made them one, andas
Grace stood receiving the warm congratulations
of those she loved, she; could scarce realize the oc-
casion, or believe she was going out from home
bearing another name and with a new protector-

ridegroom did not forget his. character as enter-
aier, and was, as usual, self-possessed and thought-
il for others. It was strange how stiffness melted
way under his efforts to dispel it at any gathering,
nd to-day he was too happy not to diffuse his spirit
1 about him. Ch'rlie Thorn and Edward Nelson

laymate, but they had never ceased to be friends
Mrs. Winthrop- was far more cheerful than she
ould have been without Ernest, and. Annie was
t ho e, going about as .if she had never been
way. The grand old elm seemed to spread itself
new to keep out the rays of the summer's sun,
nd the birds came into the branches and sang some
f their choicest melodies. The delicious home-
iade entertainment was abundant and :tempting.
nnielhad been there several days; bringing all her
xperimental knowledge-into service.
Doctor Allerton had so many friends that at
.rst he had -proposed. to have the wedding at the
hurch ; but as this did.not meet Mrs..Winthrop's
views . it was given up and the invitations confined
o mutual friends. Doctor Allerton had arranged
o take a vacation of two weeks, and in' that time
isit his mother whom he had not seen for a year.
About three o'clock his neat gig and strong, hand-
ome horse was brought to the door. Grace had
hanged her bridal dress for a traveling habit and
was standing with her fiends grouped about her.
Charles and Henry brought down the same little
runk that had accompanied -her on her former
ourneys.

" Iwas a wild thing, Ernest, for you two young
peopl to go off on such :a journey, btit it-has all

you could do to go away from Be chford ?"
" Yes, mother, the very best.  course I lose a

"I'i going to be a doctor,'' said Henry.; "my
mind is made up for that. Doctor Allerton says
he wil help me; he thinks it is the best thing I
can d.
"It looks like something a good way off, your
being a doctor," said his mother; " but 'I used to
think it would be a great while before Annie, Er..

it the time has comb."
" Rather a lonely time,.too, isn't it, mother ?"

Charles looked so indignantly grieved, tha

pillow, and scattered in the folds of his dre s. Very
quickly the day came when this beautify 1 image
must be hidden from her sight-hidden until the
trump of the archangel should bid it cone forth
free from the bondage of sin. Taking Ernest's
hand in hers, the.smitten mother went o nce more
to look upon her baby's face. The w ndering
child had sought in vain to solve the strange mys-
tery of the household, the baby's long, quiet sleep,
his mother's sad, tearful face, and his father's grave
manner !-he could not comprehend it. Doctor
Allerton paused when he came to find his wife,
where he knew she had gone. In the same parlor
where, so few days ago, we saav him enter-and sur-
prise the laughing group, he found her sitting with
Ernest on her lap, while her bowed head and fast-
coming'sobs told of the grief within. The boy's
childish words were awed into a whisper and he
went into his father's arms with a subdued glad-
ness, greatly in contrast to his usu al mann r.
"God has taken his own, mydarling." said Doc-
tor Allerton, Ttenderly drawing his wife towards
him.
"I know it now, my husband," was her quiet
reply, and, with one fervent:kiss on her baby's
brow, she went away and left im. Many sympa-
thizing friends came and listened with her to the
tender prayer offered by her kind, fatherly pastor,
and to the precious, wonderful words . e read
from God's own exhaustless book. When the
short, simple services were closed, she flowed
the little one to its resting place on the hill-side,

The years rolled on, and, other children were
given to her keeping. Her husband's professionaI
duties led him much abroad, out into the toil 'and'
weariness of life, but she kept the altar-fire of his
home burning brightly, :and reared his children
in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. It
was a strong, distinctive element of her educa-
tional training, that her .children were cre ted to
do God's will, not "as of necessity," but as glad,
willing servants, esteeming it. greater honor than
any earthly thing. With ever buoyant. spirts, and
tender sympathies, she combined the discreet,
guiding mother with the loved companion and
friend. Nor were her efforts confined to ler own
household. It was said of her,' "Such a woman as
Mrs. Allerton is one of Heaven's blessings to the
community in which she dwells." She found un-
told strength in the firm, reliant power of her hus-
band. Even on earth she learned whiy she was
kept from the flowery paths of ease, wher , rest-,
ing idly, she would never have finished  er ap-

to Mr. Welford's .at once ; tell him the papers he
told me of are not here, and I must have them at

Allerton was prompt to do the bidding. Arrived
at Mr. Welford's elegant mansion, he was shown
into the library, where that .gentleman was sitting,
conversing with a middle-aged gentleman   who
seemed to be an invalid. Ernest hesitated, 2on:see;

he had a message from Mr. Marshall.
".I understand it," said he, "and so does this
gentleman. He is a friend of Mr. Marshall and
myself, and I have just been telling him the whole
story of the case."
The message was delivered in such a manner
that it was plain the bearer understood why he
came. "I shall have to detain you a few moments,'
said Mr. Welford, "though. I think I know exactly
where to find the papers.". He left the room; with-
out thinking to introduce the young rhan to the
elder one. So they sat awhile in silence, Ernest
turning over the leaves of a book which he took
up from the table. The elder gentleman rose and
walked slowly back and forth, keeping his eyes,
Ernest. thought, very keenly fixed on him. At
length he stopped directly in front of him. ".Par-
don me,,young man," said he, :"may I ask you
what your mother's name was, before her marf
riage?"
"Grace Winthrop," said Ernest, looking pleased
to repeatit.
"Was she a cousin of Mrs. Henry Marshall.?"

CASTLES, IN THE AIR.
By RosE PORTER, author of "'Summer Drift-Wood
for the Winter Fire."
Miss Porter's first book revealed purity of
thought, and adelicacyof sentiment, combined with a
facility of expression, which at once recommended it to
the favor of the best portion of the reading public.
The present story is simple and touching; and yet it is
but a framework, upon which to hang beautiful
thoughts and the fragrant blossomings of a pious
soul.'"-N. Y. Observer.
" The tale is simple, natural and interesting, the
characters are well drawn and wellsustained. The
style is pure and flowing .while it is full of life and ex-
pression. The sentiments are the overflow of a refined
and deep Christian experience.'! -.Bardford (ourant.
"It is a story that has power, not as whirlwind;or
a thunder-bolt, but as a quiet -surn ner ,ay, whose
very stillness is its power." -arper  aqazue.

"It is one of the most beautiful Stories about Chili
have ever read-natural and simple. We cannot to
commend the volume to those who can appreciate a t
story of child-life with its manifolI small interests
joys and trials. *e most sincerely wish that every p
the land could read it."- Ifacon Weekly.
"As a pen picture of boy character, we think
scarcely be surpassed."-Church Recprd.
"Somebody's own impulsive, excitable, blunderil
boy, his heart never given the credit for its true asp'
or its warm and tender love ; nor his head for its
seeking for light and knowledge. If any one has am
household treasures such a child, this book will set hi
ing, and its lessons will touch his heart strangely.
of truth, pathos and beauty."-Presbyterian.

"A tale of girlish experience during a summer of travel,
and the writer has delicately woven through the whole a story
of love gradually developed. Miss -Porter has a deep appre-
ciation of all that is beautiful in nature and lovely in charac-
ter,- and while there is no sickly sentimentality, nothing
strained or overwrought in her book, its purity and sweetness
of thought, naturalness of expression and beauty of style,
will win for it the attention and interest of many readers. No
purer, sweeter, better volume in its way."-N. Y.times.
