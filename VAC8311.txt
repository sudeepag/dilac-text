THE ALDEBARAN, See now comes the captain all daub'd with gold lace; O ! the sweet gentleman! look in his face. SW "IT was with: little dissatisfaction,?' quoth my frienid, Brevet Major June, of the Light Artillery", " ha. opened the yellow document containing orders for nmeito  report at Governor's Island.  "Our own garrison was dull. rpoked about daily with my cane, watching vessels from the rampartis. Two soldiers had just deserted with their famTnfl'is,:in- cluding, of course, a flock of noisy children, whom I delighted to tease, anrd. who loved to cry out-- "' THE MAJOR!' and scamper away and hide themselves behind the. guns. In fact there was nobody now to keep me com- pany, since I had quarreled wimtMh the surgeon about the superiority of our respective timepiees. For having   12        -  FACA. nothing else to talk about, at twelve o'clock precisely, over the doctor would hobble to my quarters, watch in hand." "' There!' says he,' I'm right to a minute!' "No," says I, "you'rhalf a minute tho slow: here is the instrument which regulates the sun; my watch says - "'Ha! ha! he! he!' "The old chap would chuckle, ' you are a whole min- ute too-fast!' "But," says I, "a minute has elapsed." "Not a qiarter would he allow, and so we strove and parted in anger daily. In fact, I never expect, what with breakages and stoppages, and being cheated by, silversmiths, and quarreling about the time, I never ex- pect to enjoy true peace and happiness till I give up wearing a watch altogether. "But, as I was saying, there was nobody now to keep me company; nothing save a solitary yellow chicken, one of the families had left behind. The little impu- dent creatu e seemed to. do nothing else but stand on one leg and wink in the sun, and eye me askance. Doubtless she missed the children as much as I, though the ragamuffins were the torment of jer life. And there we used to stand, I on my cane, and she on her one leg, till, Christopher! it was enough to drive a man mad!"  "Sir,"' aid Major June, with ceremonious etiquette, *          I   THE  ALDEBARAN.         13 to the Superintendent of the Recruiting Service at Gov- ernor's Island, "I have the honor to report for ordeims." "You will, sail to-morrow, Major, with troops' for Texas." "What is my command, Colonel?" "Five officers, four hundred men, and,^ added he smiling, , any number of women and. children." "Children.! Christopher! that's good!" It was early in June, in a shower--it 9lways rains' when troops embark--that the Major's command was tugged away from Governor's Island to the ship Alde- baran, lying out in the stream. The men scrambled awkwardly on board, but, carefully helped the women up over the high bulwarks. Night set in soon after; thedecks were wet, the cooking-range disused and rusted, -the coal lay some- where in the unfathomable depths, and clamorous stom- achs went empty. There are few things so provocative of disturbances as empty stomachs. Here was swearing .and confusion sweet brogue and jangling German, pushing and fight- ing, miraculous escapes from breaking of necks on the slippery decks, sly jokes and loud laughter. But at length supper. came: it was 'a ration of bread to each man, and the tumult was at once calmed. Then the soldiers, forgetting all their griefs and ennities, began to settle down glumly with'their pipes, and soon thawed 2    "          FACA. into a rippling flow of words over the prospect of get- ting to sea on the morrow. The officers' cabin, too, was out of joint that night. The captain was ashore, the steward was half-seas-over already, and did not condescend to serve up supper un- til eleven o'clock. Then it was that His Celestial High- ness, Shanghai, came on in state, swimming in fat, never his own. The reeling steward went for coffee, but while bearing His Highness to the cabin, some roguish soldiers had invaded the galley, and bore away the coffee as spoils of war., A brisk game of euchre fol- lowed the meali'between the pilot aneC Major June, but the younger officers were glad to retire, and soon lay fast asleep in -heir berths. With 'the morning sunshine, whichi broke over the steeples in the city and the topmasts in the harbor, fall- ing upon!he sea, so clear and silvery, in a flood of spark- ling glory, appeared Major June, himself, rosy and fresh as the month whose name he bore. He saw with satisfaction, that good humor prevailed among the men. The smoke of the cooking apartments was climbing" the ropes and coiling itself around the rigging.          l "Well! said he, "there is a prospect of breakfast," as he saw the good humor which showed itself on the faces of the men.                X Simple major! t The hope of speedy breakfast was   T "E ALDEBARAN.         15 not the soldiers' only solace. Por numerous small boats were lying alongside and hovering near the' ship, from which suspicious-looking packages came gliding up the bulwarks and disappearing among the men, -and there was a general fumbling about the regions of the pocket, It might be seen at a glance that John Barleycorn was at hand. Finall, the officer of the day detected John, and sent his boats away--swearing.       l Then other small boats, with men, and -kits and; trunks, came out, and sailors jumped- aboard, one and another, till the ship's company was complete, even to the Skipper, who appeared last, as, skippers now and then do, summoned speedily and unexpectedly, as they often are, from the midst of their little families in the country, many times after a long voyage and little rest, and sometimes never to come back. Though it is with the fortunes of army people, that 'we shall deal mostly in this "strange eventful history," yet we hope the reader will pardon us, if, in the course 'of the work, we strive to interest him somewhat in! the politics of the sea, Pardon us, likewise, gentle reader - we know, at least the fair sex will- if we touch upon its poetry., To many dear souls, the sea seems no other than a huge tank of rain-water, klive, with such uncouth wrig- glers as the microscope discloses. But perhaps there is no portion of God's fair domain more fruitful in all   16           PACA. that is Zouching to the heart, ticklirg to the ear, or de- lightful to the imagination. In the first place, sir, sea life is uill of character- erratic, wild, sportive, superstitious, and child-like as its own playful dolphins. Then consider the multitude of events that drive mankind to seek u-on its fickle bosom their livelihood and sweet solace. Poor children of un- thrifty fortune they, full of home, mother ana sister, and a sinigle relic of all, a bible, in their slender kit. Children, many of thdm, of proud people too.  There is no end to the variety of sources from which sailors des- cend, rain-like, to be sure, from every quarter of the heavens. Sailors, dear sir, are the gipsies of the sea, the janizaries of old Neptune, the zouaves, made up of all the tribes and nations of the ear-h, a peculiar peo- ple, little cared for, coming into port with a song, going down to their watery graves "unknell'd, uncoffin'd and unsung." However, to the American, the name of sailor often presents cuite a different picture. He stands the bluff embodiment of generous daring and hardy manlinpss. Such is tLe native American sailor; socn lost to the fore- castle by rising to the quarter-deck. True to the life, we hope to present a specimen of each class. They shall be such men as God and the sea have made them, and not ideal images. As for thosb children of the ranks, and their daunt-   THE  ALDEBARAN.         17 less simple-minded officers, to whom we shall introduce the friendly reader, God bless them! they must speak for themselves. They belong to the country; our greatest, loftiest-minded country-womer. shall have no cause to blush for one at least, their spirited sister, Faca. We hope you will pardon Major March this lengthy digression, ud so, all! ,                 ' 2,:' .    * *  * *  B     .          'i   CHAPTER      II. A MUTINEER. Beings deathless as their haughty lord, Are hammered to the galling oar for life, And plow the winter's wave and reap despair. YOUNG. Ou0 skipper was one of those gentlemanly, active, young, clipper-built fellows, who have supplanted the old-fashiofied gruff sea-dogs. Moreover our skipper had none of your antiquated sea names, short and thick, but something modern and sounding,- it was Hands- allaround. The sailors, when they did not call him the "old man," cut it down to *' Harnsomre," the carpenter called him  "Handsaw," the cook clipt it shortest, and spoke of him as ' Old Hans," or in moments of. spite as "All Hands."  Thus the vanity of: the skipper's chris- tening progenitor was foiled by fate, and that beautiful name was never heard in full. The bells of the city rang out, &nd threw a sabbath on the air\ But a   sabbath-breaking steam-tug came see-sawing out, black with mischief, nipped on, and after the little dwarf the noble Aldebaran followed, like a queen led captive.          A ,   A MUTINEER.          19 Reaching the lower harbor, the tug let go and darted off in pursuit of other prey; and just inside Sandy Hook the ship dropped anchor, and lay waiting for a breeze.      '. Then decks were ordered to be scrubbed.    : As it was Sunday, perhaps, or because the sailors had come aboard in an uncomplying,' humor, or from John Barleycorn, or other cause, the order was obeyed slowly and sullenly. Whereat Mr. Clincher, the first mate, was exceeding wroth, and went about making unfriendly demonstrations, twisting and crooking a mouth naturally twisted and crooked already. At last one man threw down the "swab," and doggedly refused to work "Bring that man aft!" sternly commanded4toe: cap- tain. "Ay yi, sir 1" said the first mate, giving an: awful crook to his mouth. He brought the delinquent upon the quarter-deck.  The mate with a mouth, was a rolling, bandy-legged, middling-sized, man, with a queerly compounded ex- pression of humor and offended authority upon his face. The revolter was a thin man, with haughty-.and, once handsome features; now swollen with dissipation,.and evidently the seat of hotly contending passions, For the Iface is the play-ground of the passions, till like a school-yard, in time the flowers and grass are gone, and the ground hard-beaten and tracked., 4 '   20          PAF 4CA. A As he appeared upon the quart r-deck, a very old woman, who looked like a Spanish duenna, was stand- ing. among the camp-women near the taffrail, gave a quick start, and gazed upon the man from beneath her dark Shaggy eyebrows, with evident concern. "My man;, asked the captain, " what do you mean by refusing to work?" "First, let me ask what means tlat man," pointing to li: Clincher, "by going among seamen armed with brass knuckles? What right has he to strike me with them?-here, here!" he cried, placing his hand upon his side.             ! "Silence, sir!" The man stood twirling his doffed hat in scornful silence. "Are you drunk,: my man?" asked the skipper. "No, sir; I am not drunk. But wIong and tyranny make me mad.   It is revenge I want " Quicker than thought he sprang upon Clincher. The women screamed, and all 'ran below s ave the dark wo- man whose eyes glared so. She stood crect and motion- less, gazing on the scene. Captain and pilot coming to the Rate's rescue, the, combatants were soon parted. Then two other sailors sprung up the quarter-deck. "Down, men! down!" shouted the captain. They hesitated; their motive seemed unfixed; per- ', A   A   MUTINEER.         21 haps it was to intercede; possibly to interfere; and their broad fists were clenched. In any event they had no business there; and Major June, not wishing to bear part in this matter, but to leave the ship's officers to vindicate their authority, stood violently shaking his cane at the intruders. Not long had they to decide. The pilot turned upon them in their irresolution, and hurled them both head- long down the stairway.              . "Mr. Clincher," said the skipper, "put this man in irons." Mr. Clincher disappeared awhile, and returned 'with a pair of handcuffs. Still the old woman stood gazing unmoved.   The mate approached the rebel with the irons. Onhis right hand were seen the formidable knuckles of brass. The sailor's eyes flashed as he saw-theem, and again he rushed upon the officer -friendless as he was there. Clincher did not strike. A scuffle ensued, and the man was fettered. Words flew: "tyrants!" " venge- ance!" " liberty!" " blood!" were heard addressed to the skipper. "My man, I give you fair warning to be still." "Never!" shouted the prisoner, blind and mad with fury: and again those fearful words, and others worse. Let us not dwell upon the scene, Authority and dis- cipline were vindicated, as the victim fell heavily upon   22          FACA. the deck. At the same moment the dark old woman fainted, uttering no word. Two females bore her down into the cabin, and one was young and beautiful.- A fearful shudder went through the ship, and it was whispered, fromrpallid face to pallid face, that George had met the fate of a mutineer. The dark woman came slowly again to her senses.- Then she fixed her eyes on the young girl with a wild confused stare. "Francisca," she murmured. "What say you, grandmamma?" "Ha! no, Faca." "Dear grandmamma." A short old woman, with a pleasant, dimpled face, came into the state-room ; she said nothing, but casting an anxious glance towards the duenna, began setting things in order for a sick-room siege. Possibly her gentle bustling disturbed Constanza, the dark woman. Her face underwent a variety of contortions, which greatly alarmed the girl. "Mother," said Faca to the short bustling woman; Mrs. Trainer stepped up promptly to the bedside. The duenna rolled her eyes upon her: speaking with diffi- culty she asked, "Was it he?" "Who, Constanza?" "Jesu Maria!" groaned the woman turning .away   a A M UTIEER.         23 her face. "Alone on earth! alone, alone!" she mur- mured.  The dark shadows of the past hovered wer her. Its brooding wings seemed to gather her poor senses beneath them J 'How is it, man, when you can /take shelter only under the remembrance of troubles, when hope dies, and you take counsel with despair? The stern spirit over which the billows rolled, strug- gled with its pain, which grew gentler and gentler, till Constanza turned again towards her attendants, and asked, with tolerable Calmness,     - "The man who was struck down on deck--is he dead?"   .  "Men say so," replied Mrs. Trainor. "Cannot you tell me for certain?" ".I cannot tell, mother." Constanza relapsed into silence. The dark wings of the past again enfolded her; the present and its sur- roundings seemed forgotten. She began talking in a low hollow tone, that seemed to belong so far away!  Mrs. Trainor noticed the excited curiosity of Faca, who listened with amazement. Mrs. Trainor bade the child leave her grandinother, and go on deck, or down in that part of the ship where the other soldier-women were, for this state-room was one belonging to the officers' cabin. l   o CHAPTER III. THE DOUBLE CHASE. FACA obeyed. Then Mrs. Trainor bustled back from the door which she closed after her daughter, to the berth where the sufferer lay, and said in a firm voice - "Mother, you have nearly betrayed yourself to the child. Do you remember your promise?" "I do; I will keep it," and a hard stern look settled on her face. "Gentlemen," said the skipper to the officers, as they all sat down at dinner, after a long and painful silence, , before the unrelished, almost untasted food, ,' it must seem brutal." Judging from those cloudy faces, that was not a hazardous remark. "It is painful to me," continued the skipper. "I would sooner lose a finger any time than lay it upon a seaman, but I had to do it. Our government will not protect us-we must protect ourselves and run the chances. Had I not tamed that man, I should have had the whole crew down upon me before long. And they might have joined with them some of your soldiers - and whereas the end to the trouble?'9   THE  DOUBLE    CHASE.      25 The question wetr-t unanswered. "There is always one question to settle aboard ship, sooner or later. Who's to rule? you or I? the ship's officers or the ship's crew? I take it now, that this, point is decided, and I hope we shall have no more trouble, and witness. no more such scenes." "Th;t chap," ;aid the pilot, "was what we call a (sea lawyer.' They come on board with their long tongues, and talk to' the hands of rights and wrongs, and all that sort of d-i nonsense.  I overheard this 'ere. very chap say he'dl make a good ship of her before- she returned to New York."'  "Yes," said thej skipper, getting the upper hand of the officers is what they call making a good ship. I've \ known a whole crew refuse to work, and what are you going to do?"  "Poor fellows.! sighed Major June, so as not to be heard by the captain."  "Poor fiddlesticks!" ejaculated another officer, towards whom all faces were turned with some, surprise. The speaker was a tall gaunt man, with rather & wearied look upon his brown features. Time seemed to be making premature havoc there. Without another word he left the table. - "Don 't mind him,captain," said Major June., "That's . old Sol, the Father 'of Lieutenants, we call him. He fancies he has' outlived .the weaknesses of 'men in the twenty years he has been waiting his untastedd promotion. i   26          FACA. I 'll lay a wager now, you'll find him with a tear in his eye this minute." "The sailors are to be pitied indeed," said the skipper. "Take these men of mine. -They haven't been ashore perhaps more than a week after a long voyage. As soon as they go ashore, pockets full, the boarding-house keepers, or boarding-masters, as they call 'em, get 'em ' drunk, cheat them out of every copper, club in with the shipping-masters and ship them off before they get sober. As for the shipping-masters they often rob them of the month's advance pay, under some pretence or other,--a board-bill or some other debt, and so com- pletely impose upon credulous Jack, that, he turns round and says, ' thank ye, sir!' " "Christopher!" exclaimed the major. "No wonder they won't work!  I'd mutiny myself, sir!" At this moment the cry was heard overheard-- "A duce-, a duck overboard!" The officers rose from the table and ascended the dee, where they saw the soldiery, lately penetrated with awe and terror, now jeering and laughing with infinite good humor at the erratic performances of an escaped duck. The gladdened little creature, having by a skillful movement thrust himself between the bars of his prison, and either smelt or seen his native element, had itncon- tinently flung himself into the sea." With joy he dipped down his bill; then finding it so salt, and different from all former experiments, he   became frightened and swam again rapidly for the ship. Here he encountered the high wooden 'wall, and a human enemy still more forbidding, in the second mate, worthy Mr. Junks, an old whalesman and experienced harpooner, stood ready to fling a slip noose around the timid bird's   long neck, .and away he swam, instinctively cautioned agaainst the common enemy of his race. It was a matter of interest to see what he would try !  next. Again he dipped his bill into the briny water, sliook his wise head, tried it once more, and then essayed i  to fly away. But his wings refused their office,-he was neither a salt-water duck, nor a wild one, but a weak, civilized slave of man. J   Here his cogitati ns were startled by a bullet, whose.,; before-unheard-of muisic came singing but too near. his I  head, and down he dived; then up he came, and swam around and around, bewildered and frightened, and div ' I  ing and paddling this way and that, as ball after ball flew into the water, near him, now on this side it came, I  and now on that, over his head, or falling short. Oh! it was rare but savage, inhuman sport. It was from the revolver of old Sol, that the bullets came; whether to save the little creature from- a still worse fate, or what not, no one knew so, well as old Sol himself.,  iL fMr. Junks!" ca'-ledaout the captain. S' Sir!" responded Mr. Junks. "Let down the qlzrter-boat and catch that fowl." E        ,           -   28          FAC A. "Ay yi, sir! I 'll make sure of him," The gentlemen remonstrated; even eld Sol pleaded "that the bird had fairly won its freedom." "There is no telling holw important it may be before the end of the voyage," coolly replied -,he skipper, as Junks and two seamen pulled away in the Small boat. But ere many strokes of the oars the water-fowl scented the danger, and began to use its own paddles. In a few minutes however the f chase " was over- hauled. Junks'stood in the bow, bent down; the boat is almost on the bird, Junks snatched below at the water, and lo! he missed him." "Bravo!" shouted Major June. New Junks took the oar; again the boat is on the enemy; the oar descends--surely that head is worth nothing to thee now, my long-billed friend! No, he has dived down and come up away yonder. "Bravo! ' again cried the cheery mator.  Then 'the quarter-boat was signalled in, and Mr. Junks returned somewhat discomfitted. While Mr. Junks was pulling in, the people on deck were startled by an apparation, for surely it seemed no less. There is the pale and bloody mutineer. His hands are free; he holds a long knife; he sees Clincher, he comes, the avenger! Tearing through the thick crowd, the terrified mate fled towards the cabin with the ghost at his heels. Each moment, each millionth part of a moment, is   I         TH E  DOUBLE    CHA:SE.!     29. marked in that race of two score feet, between the two pale faces, with the knife glittering above. The mate    reaches the cabin ere the steel descends; and the pur- suer vanishes." -- Then the captain, and Mr. Junks, and that pale mate, are seen, the latter with a pistol in his-trembling hand, I  searching the ship. A hiss, and cries of "shame!:" are I  heard rising, from - the soldiers, who witness the search, ;  stifled by their offcers, who fly among the men with' drawn swords.   ' The moments again seem   ages, each one expected with a shot from Clincher's pistol. But it is not heard, i  nor is George seen.

Mr. Junks was a short, erect, laconic man. One of those people who look wise and say nothing. So nothing could be drawn from Junks, and the fate of George, the mutineer, remained a mystery.            , 3*    CHAPTER IV. FACA AND THE     LIEUTENANT, Love is a pearl of purest hue, But stormy waves are round it. L. E. L. God gives us love. TENNYSON, A LIGH   breeze from the south'ard and east'ard caused a sensation of relief and pleasure among "all hands." The anchor was lifted, sail after sail was set, and like a new-born spirit, arming himself with great powers, the ship raised her white wings and bore (away with her mighty unknown world. A little vessel appear- ing in the distance, the pilot watched it narrowly. The only talkative pilot ever known was he. With their eyes aloft, or ahead, and mouths full of quid, this class of men are noised abroad for their authoritative, dogmatic, taciturnity. None such was Pilot Friendly. He delighted in talking. He called the captainihis "i boy," after the fashion of nurses who are fain to claim all the little ones they marshal into existcnce,-so often had he -brought the captain into port, and then seen him fairly to sea again. With one eye on the man at the lwheel, and another forward, or upward, this pilot gave his tongue to the passengers.   FACA  AND  TIIE LIEUTENANT.     31 I    "( -My grandfather was a pilot," said Friendly, '"my , father was a pilot; my brothers are both pilots, and- !t  my mother was a pilot." I   .(!"What's that, sir?" asked the major, pricking up his ears. "Yes, sir," replied Friendly, smiling on the simple major in a patronising way, "I'm pilot from both sides of the house. I'll tell you how it was. The pilot boat, had been out cruising round a week or more, and every man who could steer a ship was suddenly enmployed,! leaving no one on board but the old lady and two boys., It was twenty miles off Sandy Hook. A ship hove in sight and had to be taken in; my amother took the helm, crossed the bar, made the Narrows, and sailed up to the city safe and sound. Captain, where 's your bawling- iron?"  "My what?' "Your bawling-iron, boy! or speaking trumpet, or! whatever ye call it?" The pilot hailed his little clipper-built schooner, which  sent a boat off to the Aldebaran. Friendly took "the. last letters,"--the officers had each written a score, at least, of " last letters," - gave his 1( boy " awarm grip of the hand, and descended the side of the ship to his jolly-boat. "Never-Sink' lighthouse did "sink" that night, at least Junks said so. And next morning the ship was fairly at sea, for a flock of Mother Carey's chickens were !    32-          BACA. seen, close at hand, following in the wake of the vessel, and picking up the crumbs that fell. What sweet, cheery little sounds they piped forth! Some off the soldiers' children had great full catching these little birds, by means of fine spool thread, which they suffered to unwind and stream loosely in the air: the foolish chickens knew no better than to entangle their wings, and were hauled in amid wild shouts of childish delight.' It was not Junks, but Clincher, who taught the urchins thus to inveigle the silly birds. Yet Clincher was not a bad man, but delighted in small children, and small jokes, too, as we skall see in due time. The poor old woman was able to be on deck to-day. There she stands, with that beautiful girl and a young corporal- we know it -by the chevrons on his arm- Corporal Marshal, reader. The old woman wears a mantle over her head, and a white cap of many folds beneath; and her hair is very grey. The girl is dressed in a neat, closely-fitting dress of grey linen, which sets off a graceful figure. Her features are very chastely chiselled, and 'er eyes, how intensely black, and yet how soft they are. The thoughts of the dark woman are evidently wan- dering, but those of the young couple are nearer by, for they seem to watch the little petrels with some in- terest.   FACA    ANID  TIlE  LIEUTENANT.     38. ( I know of nothing more solitary," said the young man, speaking to the old woman, "than a lone stormy petrel far out at sea." Tlhe young girl looked grateful for the word said to her aged companion; but the latter, if she heeded'the remark at all, said nothing. "Shall I sing you some verses about one?" asked the young man.  Again thB grateful lookl of those eloquent bright eyes. The duenna only nodded a stern sort of approval. The young man walked away in an-easy, martial manner, followed by the soft beautiful eyes. He, re- turned soon with a small guitar, and looking over the, sea, by the side of Faca, who stood facing the dark woman, sitting near the taffrail with her hands folded, the young soldier sanlg to a low plaintive melody his SONG OF THE STORMY PETREL AND POND-LILY. "Pretty pond lily, wil 't wander with me? I wait on the storm-iing far o'er the seCa; AMy winglets are fleet o'er the billowy'foam; ! .  I 've never a resting place - never a home.". ' Stormy petrel, thou art sighing for rest ; Come sleep on my bosom; come dwell in my breast; The storm-king shall call thiee in vain from the shore; Thy trumpet-scream lead on his battles no more."   34            FACA. "Pretty pond lillyj the sea must be crost;j The knight-clouds are must 'ring their helmeted host I 'My destiny beckons from love and from thee; In dreams let thy gentle thoughts wander with me." "Stormy petrel! I will sail o'er the main!  This bosom shall bear thee in peril and pain." "Yet, where were the shelter, fair lily, for thee;- Thy soft petals scattered abroad on the sea?  "'T is home where my love is, by sea or by shore;- Thy winglet my shelter, I pray for no more: A providence cares for the stormy petrel; ! The sea-weed is watched till the opean is still." There was a hush on the quarter-deck while these simpl- words were singing, though few besides Major June caught their meaning as they fell.    He watched the young soldier as the latter turned towards his fair companion, saw the little blush which tried to hide it- self under her ringlets, and noticed a silent tear trickle down the wrinkled brown cheek of that old woman. "Christopher!"  exclaimed  the major, "lthat girl runs in my head like a new tune." "  What girl?" asked Old Sol. "The one in greylinen, with the old woman.     Ex- cept the raven of her eyes and hair, she! is of the pure American order."  "American order!" sneered Old Sol.   -FACA!AND   THE  LIEUTENANT.     35 it Yes, sir! I throw down. my gauntlet on that! We  have an American order of female beauty. It is not Greek, after Scopas' Venus, nor Italian, after the Venus de lMedici,-aan imitation of Scopas,-'nor after the Madonna,--an imitation of both, with a. trace of He- brew; nor yet English, nor French, nor Spanish." 'Then what is it?" asked Old Sol, now curious. \' Composite, sir, and distinct as the composite order of architecture.'        l "Can you define' it?" "Yes; the oval face, brown hair, blue eyes, jaw not so, square as the Grecian, cheek-bone less protuberant. than Spanish or Indian, nose less prominent than He- brew or Italian, eyes less almond-shaped than the Ori- ental ;-the oval, sir, perfect oval! that is the highest expression for the American style of beauty. lChristo- pher, there she stands, now! -I hope she has not over- heard me." Thus Major June established it, that Faca, with her oval face was the pure type of American beauty.    ] A black boy came upon the quarter-deck, and an- nounced the evening meal to-the party, with a ludic- rous bow and scrape. As they went below, one by one, Old Sol lingered be- hind the others,. and stole an inquisitive shy look at Faca; then he Iblushed as he saw her- advancing or   i 86          F A A.  making an involuntary movement towards 'him. He was quite sure now. "Little Faca!T "he exclaimed. "Lieutenant Soldan, I am so glad, sir, to meet you again." "I must not call you' little Faca' now." "O yes, sir, more than ever," was her eager reply. As he left her, Faca blushed, and then sighed, to thiink how womanhood was coming to separate her from such a friend--womanhdod was not all, alas! their ranks in life were so different. , Thus we go on dividing, we grown up children! Shall not the Fates draw'Faca and her old friend together again? I Far ahead we see the ,ending forms of love, mutiny, eath  The child shall prove herself a woman, ,.the man 'a child.

Evening fell, and the wind fell. Up rose a fog.- It swallowed up, at eight o'clock, the foretop, the stars, the sea and sky. The officers settled gloomily in the cabin. The men dropped away into their berths by fours. Tattoo broke from the bellies of two drums and the threoats of two fifes, and fell from the precipices of night, as the herd, possessed by evil spirits, broke down the crags of Judea, fell into the sea. "Taps" beat, and  all the world swung in ham- mocks at rest. The mist rolled up, pile on pile, of moun- tains, Alps of the sky. Now a great ball of white fire flies from those cloud- craters, upwards t upwards! and the moon bestrides the sea and heaven "like a Colossus." O, the moun- tains of cloud-land! are they not more beautiful, with night and morning sitting on their grey and blue cliffs, like watchful shepherds with their crooks, while God's lambs roam the hills and valleys of-the ocean, than the mountains of " this too solid earth." It may be that Faca was romantic, for she- stole out of her berth, above the duenna, flitted through the empty cabin, and gained the quarter-deck, to star-gaze; the full- orbed radiant moon shone down upon the ship, and flooded the sea - the wide, wide mystic sea! Except the watch and sentries, all the hundreds of souls with whom the Aldebaran was freighted were bound in sleep. Major June, standing not far off, alone   NOON    AND NIGHT.       39 -was alive to the glories that sparkled around in the full tide. of moonlight. The whee:sman silently stood at his steadfast work, now gazing aloft, narrowly watching the sails, and now peering into the binnacle, to keep the ship on her course. Near the m'zzen-mast stood the second mate, ever and anoI scanning the horrizon with his " weather-eye "and kee ing a strict watch upon the ship's motion, calling out at ldng intervals, "How does she head??" "South-by-West, sir!  Ol1 either side the wheel, seamen lay "keeled up" with sleep, ready to spring at a word, while forward, stooc: one looking out with sleepless eyes, ahead. "Sail ho!" he cries. "ahere away?" demands the mate, "r Hhree points o' the weather bow, sir!" OL the main deck walks the sentry, with sleepy, mondtonous pace, waiting impatiently to be relieved by some' one of those buckled and belted figures stretched out at the feet of the corporal of the guard, who leans over ;here against the railing, nodding. - Silence and the sea; two sublime infinities! incapa- ble of comprehension, what eloquence!". murmured the devout major to himself. "And  amidst it allliton her lonely way I y. thousands of heavenly lamps, with her white topsails steepling to the sky, the precious bur-   40            F FAcA. dened ship shakes the light sea-dew from    her strong waist, and goes lounding along like a lion." "Yes," again murmured the major, " a ship at sea is one of the three most beautiful things in the world." Then lifting his eyes to the starry heavens, he repeated to himself those glorious words of Milton:-- (Moon! that now meet'st the orient sun, now fly 'st, With the fix'd stars, fix'd in the orb that flies; And ye fivel other wandering fires! that move, In mystic dance not without song, resound Hfis praise, who out of darkness called up light Air! and ye elements! the eldest birth Of nature's womb, that in quaternion run Perpetual circle, multiform, and mix And nourish all things; let your careless change Vary to our great Maker still new praise."

FED A ND CLEANSED AT SEA., The beaten soldier proves most manful, That, like his 'sword endures the anvil,  And justly Is held more formidable, The more his valor's malleable. HuDMAS. OUR hero, Corporal Marshal, was lodged aboard ship -n the most unromantic manner. Soldiers always are. !oretimes they are made to stretch out, without mat- rasses, on the soft side of a plank, between decks, or !nywhere.  Sometimes they have mattresses-most oix-monly only blankets-one each; but they club to- getjer, and bunk in on shares. The Aldebaran was a egilar emigrant ship, and provided with bunk-frames e I   e   s  a uspended by iron rods, between decks, Four men Slept in a bunk, where four Irishmen, four Dutchmen, r four women, or three men and one woman, and a few chiliren, or three women and one man, had often slept together before. There were bulk-heads in the after part of the ship below, fited up with bunks. In. these separate apart- *  .

The crowds in these rooms were thicker, the air more confined. : The deck, still further down below, served far storing away the provisions required for immediate use, and was likewise used as a drill-hall. Further down still, was the hold, where the water hogsheads, and the greater portion of the provisions and ship's stores were packed away.    The crew slept in their own castle the forecastle. Major June's command was divided into companies and detachments at Governor's Island, where they had been drilled awhile. These divisions were preserved on shipboard, and the first night it was important to have them all assigned to their respective bunks, for the neat police of which the men were held severally accountable. This is an important matter in all transport ships,-- the basis of order and cleanliness. Cooks and cooks' attendants were selected from the soldiers. Each day the rations for the day were deliv- ered to these "chosen few," to prepare for the many. The recruit, unlike the state of things in garrison, had no plates, knives or forks, tables or napkins. In his knapsack, rolled up in a stock or stocking, was an iron   I j ,THE   B EIG.-1T BUTTONS,      43 s00oo, ard from his waist-belt dangled a tin cup.

They marched towards the galley b, file on one side, filled their cups, moved around the gal-  ley, and, returning down on the other dide, took the bread or meat, or whatever was to be eaten, on the b hnd as a plate, and bestowed themselves in- whatever pCrt of -the ship was handy, and secure from sailors, music-boys, dogs, pigs, or other beasts of prey. Tken the. next company marched up with the like. "intrepid tread," received'their rations, and hied away, a alad several, to some place of security. [THle American soldier's ration is good and liberal, utormparable in any other community-life, military or civil, froir Shakerdom to Sebastopol, or from an asylum down to a Fourierite phalanx, to wit.;- Three-fzurths of a pound of pork or bacon, or One and one-fourth pounds of fresh beef, and Eighteen ounces of bread or flour for each man per day, and at the rate of             I Eight cuarts of beans or peas, or in lieu thereof, ten poinds of rice, Six pounds of coffee, -Twelve pounds of sugar, Four quarts of vinegar, One and a half pounds of tallow, or !    d44      !  .

Besides this, at sea, or wherever it is deemed, by thi surgeon and commanding officer, to be necessary, thern is a liberal supply of molasses, onions, pickles, driec apples, and other anti-scorbutics, and, if at a post, what ever fish may be caught, or vegetables raised. The human form divine is never a pleasant specta cle when feedin7g; but recruits! hurly-burly, scuffling and "grubbing,'? growling like wild beasts, cramming like pelicans or sea-ravens: "stealings in, and de'i take the hindmost!" is the cry. There the officer of the day stands, above the herd shaking his fist, his foot, his hat, his sabre, anythinf he can lay hold of, bcalling for the guard, swearing anc storming! O! ho*w our officers swear at - recruits! Some of the non-commissicned officers are, if possible yet more fierce, bearing a personal interest in the fray and they accordingly drive, and pull, and push, anc knock, and kick, and tear, the men from their victuals ill-gotten, and sometimes, well-gotten, but under sus picion.

"Wash; him!" was the simple advice of Mr. Dick to Aunt Betsey, over tae forlorn runaway, Master David Copperfield. I On the second morning at sea, the officers in the cabin were awakened from   their dreams of the 'St. i Nicholas, or the June fields in the country, pinks, pop- 1es, and rosies, red cheeks, white muslin, sweet eyes, ;litter-cups, and buttermilk, by the cry of-"O! ho! F osey, haul!" to which a violent stoppage was put, and tie sleepy dreamers jumped from their berths as the vvessel shook, rith the shout that went up. It seems Ithat a hundred or mord of the soldiers had 'tken hold of a rope to aid the sailors in bracing up tlhe yards and were pulling away in lively chorus, lwhen, by. alsudden, and possibly accidental slip of the rope, the multitude were precipitated upon the deck. At surgeon's call that morning, sundry unaccountable "pumps" were complained of. A--r'ter surgeon's call came guard mounting. A guard of twelve was daily formed; four sentinel' paced the   -46         jgFACA. decks, at a "relief7", of two hours each, or were posted over the water-tank, or at other spots sacred to the pro- fane mob.       i , ;  And now while two companies go below to drill, which may be -heard, tramp, tramp, tramp! those ' remaining are aligned on the upper deck. "Two ranks face inwards " is the sergeants order. "Off shoes and stockings!" "Roll up your pantaloons to your knees!" "Now, fire away! ' A stream of cool salt-water issues from a pipe, along the ranks, delicious to the legs and feet of the soldiers. One may little imaginel the excitement, the almost fear, the thrilling bodily tremor, previous to the first shock. That over, they, delighted in the cool deluge, hold forth their brawny limbs eagerly for the water to breathe its freshness upon them. ; They huddle up towards the gushing pipe in groups, impatient of the momentary delay ere "their turn comes," and dance and shout for joy.

FACA  OF  'OUIRS t  With thee all toils are sweet; each clime hath charms ; -Earth, sea, alike - our world within our arms. !THE unconscious beauty of the ship was Faca, adopted daughter of old Orderly-Sergeant Trainor, of the 8th Infantry. Tke sergeant had married a better person than camp- I wmen generally are. He was in his youth stationed A at; New London, in" the State of Connecticut, where he forind his pearl of a little wife, the daughter of a once wall--o-do farmer in the country near. Tfaca, their only child was carefully brought up, for   a soldier's child, and was just returning to the regiment af er a three year's cheap but thorough finishing up in i  a girl's school. So much for Faca and her happy parents, whom she deeply loved - above gallant lovers, above fortune and w  at is smoothly called  "respectability," above the comforts of divil life. Faca was enthusiastic in her love ofk ths army, for officers and men had always been kind to the shy;, mysterious, yet well behaved child. The young soldier seen singing last evening at her   48          F AOC A) ? side, and looking fondly with his fine eyes upon Fa( was no hero of romance -he was only a corporal in o Sergeant Trainor's company. He had lost -his fath when a bit of a lad, and enlisted for a musician , Governor's Island. William had grown up under S( geant Trainor's eye. "The lad has sent h's poor old mother all his pay said the sergeant to his wife. ",General Jackson! I' not afraid to have him g with our little daughter. F a boy that 's good to his mother will be good to his wil and- if Faca falls in love with the like of William Ma shal what's the harm?." .         - "Yes she may go farther and fare worse, that s] might, old man; but its to think of ever parting wil her, that mnakes me afraid of all young men," replic the anxious mother."        - Faca herself was innocently and strangely puzzled, - for was not William a gentle and handsome, and a bran youth? Yes, but Faca wished not to think of love f( many a year yet; not at least till she had made up, l personal services, for the expense and self-denial of h( parents in keeping. her so long at school. That Williai was marvellous well-looking could not be gainsayed but in New England schools they are taught to gen, ralize, and to view things and people in the abstrac and Faca preferred to pass by the attentions and eve notice of the genus liono. And as for flirting, Faca wc t6.          .        .    FACA  O:F "OURS."       49 c!    such a sim ple goose of a child, that she abominated it; mo, in few words, Faca was coy.  This very timidity had attracted William towards hex I 11 the mrore, especially during the few weeks they had spelt together on the lovely green walks, and under the wide trees, and down the purlng beach, at E:i;il 'Governorfs Island, where William had last served on Irecruiting duty, and where the Trainors had been kept waiting a time, for an opportunity to rejoin their regi- tt  " ment.      '  X^ill  But there was a greater foe than Faca's objections to fthe "geni's man," in the path of William 'Marshal,a i j!  i very lion. Poor William could not resist one insidious X^l   enemy. He got tipsy on occasions. At least Mr. Bar- i    ^ldo:ph said. so; perhaps we shall see who this Mr. Bar- f olph was presently; and, furthermore, he accounted for e  strange fact, that nobody else ever suspected,--in this way.. He said, that "an old infantry officer had early taken a great fancy to William, and taught igji'  Fim: his (wn three accomplishments, when camped amid  he everglades of Florida; these were poetry, music, and tippling secretly, and so as to hide the effects from com- aon observers. But one pair of sharp eyes had made the discovery I f Willinm's third accomplishment. and he was a rivaL iA great bushy-bearded, tall man, the drum-major of, a ba id, a new acquaintance, and William's profess'ed X ^ , -   -: , ^ .

He had hovered aroun him, hid behind trees, looked in at windows, dropped i upon him at bed-time and at rising-time, but hithert had discovered nothing of consequence in William's lov affairs. Faca always shrank from Mr. Bardolph instinctively "Gentlemen with bushy beards are seldom favorite with beautiful young women.

"Mr.- Bardolph;had- heard the song of the Storm] Petrel and the Pond Lily. His mind was made up. "Sergeant Trainor, my very dear old friend!"

Mr. Bardolph, this place is full of whmeri." Mr l:Bardolph was polite; he ithdrew. Possibly the expectation of meeting Faca en dishabille had urged the d'rum-major into one of the married people's'apart- m renits, for such things sometimes urge polite ren- against their will, of course. In a moment the sergeant followed Mr. Bardolph out.   tFACA, OF  "OURS.. '      51 a( t   "'ly dear friend your daughter is in danger!"

With no little display of pity, the' wily Bardolph sup- ported the old sergeant a moment at the door. Then X1:;l Mrs. Trainor came and relieved him of the' precious burden. Let the loving heart only tell how many bur- : i1ii dens there are that we find precious, an aged father, or Xi;  a sickly child. Mr. Bardliph sauntered slowly along the dim passage, triumphing already, in. his imagination, and charmed that ]is poison had taken so well, when he heard a step behind him, and a voice striving for utterance, he turned. There was Faca's grandmother. Her face was almost liii hidden beneath her mouth, but a fearfilly flaming eye shot :rom beneath its heavy folds. When it was'seen. that Mr. Bardolph awaited her, out of the cloud came a   62          PACtA. trembling finger, a long, and bony fore-finger, and then was heard a shrill voice. "Man! man! thou liest! , beware!" "Ha! ha!" laughed the drum-major, in h's easiest manner, "old lady, you are excited." But the duenna turned and re-entered the married people's apartment. A month or more Mr. Bardolph had known the Trainors, but now for the flrst time' he asked himself, "Who is this mysterious old witch of their's?"   CHAPTER      VIII.

It is thought worth while for the tailor to learn his trade, the judge must be a lawyer, the doc- tor take his degree.

Old Sol meant only to condemn such practices as that prevalent in the Mexican war, of appointing gentlemen out of civil employments, with perhaps some smattering of militia, not military, experience, into the higher com- missions, whiile there stood, by, neglected, hundreds of gallant, well-trained, and- talented officers. "It was no less an abuse :upon -the country than an outrage on military men," said he.

The mate and Old'Sol1 hurried below. They were joined by Major June in demi-costume. On reaching that portion of the ships assigned to the married people, they found a swarm!of: soldiers and their wives, already aroused, and filling the middle space or hall. Near the door of the room where Sergeant Trainor lay sick, a young woman had fallen down, pale and-speechless. It was Faca. The tears dropped from the face of Old Sol as he cart ried the beautiful young creature to her state-room, and admitting no one except her mother who followed fright- ened; he closed the state-room door, and went aBer the surgeon.

DURING the day following, three distinguished sports- men made their appearance. Shark, grampus and sea- gull. The grampus belongs to the royal family, the whales, whose pedigree is more ancient than -that of English lords. The whale was set apart for royal use by the common, law of England- as everybody knows, and hence -called the "royal fish."  The head was appropriated to the kings use,I and theail to the quee's. This latter was accounted for by one learned law com- mentator, on the necessity of whaleborne for her majes- ty's petticoats. But a later commer-tator upsets the supposition completely, by stating that whalebone comes from the head of the royal fish and no- the tail. This, therefore, remains one of the greatest points of dispute in the legal profession - What did her majesty do with the w}ale's tail? On casting the lead, morning and evening, it was found the ship was drifting towards the coast of Virginia; the weather continued warm and foggy. "No observation of the sun to-day," said the skipper, "we have to steer by the blue pigeon."   FISH  STORIES I        67 "Pray what's that, captain?" inquired one. "The lead and line, sir." A laugh was heard among the troops. The officers looked, and saw that it arose over the antics of two funny pigs, little black fellows, always playing with the men, or a sociable Newfoundland dog belonging to Captain Handsallaround. The dog was of their own color at least; but their consortingwith the men was inexcusable, for a pig has four legs and a man but two. Grant that man has five faculties to the pigs four, it leaves an odd leg to account for. We leave the ques- tion to legal men, with that of the tail-royal. !" ta! ha! ha!" the men laughed again. One of the pigs in chasing the dog "slipped up" on the wet deck, and rolled down to the leeward side of the ship. "( Pigs are capital scavengers," said the skipper, " and they are very much improved by sea air and ship diet. Nothing so sweet as their meat after a few voyages. We killed one on our last run from Liverpool that had made five voyages with us, and I never tasted anything so sweet." 4( Yes," growled Clincher, " and had a devil of a gale too; we always do when we kill a pig at sea; its a sure sign of a storm."         : "Ask him about 'Braddock's Pigs," said the-skipper winking towards a young officer. , Old Braddock of Fssex had three pgs," said- the  s s ai ,ie   68             .   ...ACA. mate, quite gravely speaking, "he put -hem in three pens, one over the other, and fed only -Jie top one. They turned out the fattest pigs in the county, and the bo0ttom :one was the fattest of the three; that's a iact." Clincher's gravity, and look of worder and credulity were irresistible. His eyebrows were highly arched, but humor lay around his slouched mouth, and what be said, his eyes seemed to believe, while his mouth flquted and made fun of it. The fog, now driven away from the Aldebaran, retired upon the horizon, where it appeared likse a huge sea-ser- pent devouring' distant ships. Sails came and 'nent amid its mighty coil, rising up and going down. The sun, shining out but too brightly, drove a couple of young officers into the cabin's shade: they had been listening to Clincher's whale stories. "He vows,^ said one, f"that he has a whale-jook now, with which he has taken many a great whale." "A whale-hook, sir?" cried Major June. "Yesj sir,"replied the youngster, Lieutenant Swallow, a simple fellow by nature, and unspoilt by education at 'the Point.' "Don't you believe it? he swore to it ' roundly., "And then he told us," said another officer, "that a whale struck the ship thij morning." "Yes," said Swallow, 'a'nd the man at the wheel said he felt the jolt; I heard that.' "And that he was on?offrq a ship once ,.icl cap-   I S H  S O R I ES.      69 tured' two whales, off, Hatteras, and towed -theWanlmals into New York, both bigger than the ship herself. One grounded off Sandy Hook, and was wrecked.- "Christopher! that 's capital!" laughed Major-June, rubbing his hands. "And the other," resumed the Lieutenant, "waws towed into the harbor, and: afterwards used as a dredge- boat."              -  Golly!" exclaimed young  Swallow, very much excited: "I wonder if that's the one we saw? O! i I don 't believe- that story!"  '\ "Did he-tell you of Braddocks fishing excursion?' inquired Captain Handsallaround. 0- .     : "No sir."'     .          .  . '"One day,' he says, ' Braddoek and anotner old cove, a chum of his, went a fishing; on coming- back home at night;, they hung up their lines to ;dry from the front of the house. The hooks hung nearly to the ground? -there were twenty five of them. On turning out next morning, what do you think Braddock found?' Here the captain began to arch his, eyebrows and slouch his mouth in mimicry of Clincher, ';why there wasa a c at caght on every hook, and one hook had a cat and a young kitten besides -!"       - :-  - ; ;  - It was as if a bomb-shell had burst ;in th6e cabin, it was cleared of occupants in a moment, exept :* ho fell from their chairs-unable to rush on-deck.

He came from Hartford, and lived in Essex. He was a sail maker. I 've known him; ever since I was knee-high to a chaw of tobacco. We boys always called him "Old Hooks ; nothing made him madder, because it tWitted on facts, His fingers and toes were hooked up like harvest sickles, and he always went bare- footed, summer and winter. One day he was standing on the wharf chawing to- bacco till the streams ran down both sides of his mouth, and he couldn't talk plain from it, and a passenger on a steam boat asked " how his fingersocame so crooked?" "Woping sails," says he wiping his mouth. "Well," said the stranger, "do you rope sails with your feet too? Old Hooks shook his fist at the stranger, and the boys on the dock laughed, and this made him perfectly raving. Swallow. Is he a living character now? Clincher. Yes, livin' and pious - never brags either. He goes to prayer-meeting and prays like Goliah of Gath. There's something in scripture about the roar- ing lion, ain't there? Swallow. Yes. Clincher. Hooks called him the woarin' pigthat went about seeking to bite somebody. But the way he caught them geese was a caution.   FISH   STORIES.       71 Swallow. How was that? Clineher.

Well, you see, they'had been shot at so much they were too wild for -Braddock to come nigh 'nough to git a shot, so he took a hundred-fathom dine and triced it round an eel amidships. The geese were all squatting out on a sand-bar, and swimming round near it. The eel swam out there in the course of the morning, and first one goose swallowed it, and then another, till the whole flock were strung onv the line. The eel toggled in the last goose, and Old Hooks drew in five hundred and twenty-three wild-geese at one "hauL" Keep her up Jackr  The man at the wheel had colapsed. Clincher always looked the personification of simple truth.  He never laughed, and seemed quite hurt atany sign of suspicion concerning his veracity. It was not till the very best of a knotty yarn, that you could detect the slightest sign )f inward delight. Even then, the least possible curl in one corner of his crooked mouth, a minute sparkle of laughing light in his eye, was all.   CHAPTER XII. A NEW  ALLY. OLD SOL'S prejudices against the softer, weaker vessel of humanity was inveterate. He had sworn on the    j bible not 'to marry, and had harangued every young  graduate on the folly of "mamrrying in the army."    J "Dancing and Sirting at home in civilization with the bright bright buttons, is one thing," said Old Sol, j oftentimes, "but love in a case-mate, or love in a tent, is another." And he frequently wound up his discourse with the emphatic remark, "Besides all women are    ! fools"         * But Old Sol was determined on investigating the  cause of Faca's scream. With maidenly pride, Faca refused to betray her   0 affairs.                         "But," remonstrated her father, " the lieutenant be- longs to our regiment; he is an old friend; that is, he never put me in the guard-house for persuading a man." "Persuading a man," meant knocking him down, in the old sergeant's vocabulary. Soldiers are mere chil- dren in the hands of their officers; but soldiers' children   A, NEW' ALLY.          73 \ ire the most independent of little folks, and Faca re- used to tell. Mr. Bardolph soon saw that neither Old Sol nor Faca's Parents knew cf his behavior that night. This made he bushy-bearded Man rejoice again. Confident in her iscreticn,: he resolved to make the most of it. Neither fficer of the day nor sergeant of the guard inspected Lt night that par- of the ship in which the band and larried people were quartered.  The lantern was "ourning dimly in the middle of the lark passage: like a beast of prey, he lay in wait for is victim, after the " taps" had be4tten sounding all ) bed. Old Constanza always retired early, and it was Faca's V abit to sit with her parents at night until they sought leir beds, when she ascended to her state room. Old Sol, with unselfish passion, stood guard at the ead of the stairwy, i. e., he sat there, looking at the ars, smoking lhis cigar, and listening for sounds below. b was ten o'clock, tour bells had just struck, when Old ol caught sound. o: a light footstep, the quick tread of man, a slight scream, the slam of a door.

BENEATH the shadow of the spanker sat three musi- cians next morning - two violins and a trombone. Hark to the waltz! German soldiers on deck are at once in lively motion. Now it is a jig. Jaclk dances a hornpipe, and every soul aboard; the Aldebaran gives token of life and animation. Men sea-sick yesterday are dancing to-day..  The band-master yonder has furnished this musical treat, but he is too proud to take part with the compar- atively raw musicians, part of the' band recruited for an infantry regiment, and on their way out " to join," it is beneath his dignity. A bandmasters "position" is equivocal; his education, and frequently his associations with superior people in former days,-possibly your bandmaster may have been a nobleman,- render the company of common soldiers, even if musicians, disa- greeable; and yet his present rank precludes him from the society of officers, for distance, you know, is the soul   BURNT   POKER   PORTRAITS.      75 of discipline. There this gentleman stands, looking over the bulwarks, with his arms folded, a- musical Na- poleon from his St. Helena looking on the sea. "There are vqrious degrees of pride," said O0d Sol, philosophically, t the skipper. "There was Mrs. Portfire, 'the ordnance-sergeant's wife at Fort Knox; as her husband ranked above the other sergeants, she drew   ! herself up above their wives. Indeed it was only by  \ the greatest effort of complaisance, that she could per- suade herself to be civil even to the officers' wives, And, sir, such was tLie sense of her self-importance, that, she could not sell eggs to the ladies of the- garrison without demanding thrice their value! In a word she)- stood isolated,-like the bandmaster yonder. "Next in official grade to the bandmaster is Sergeant, Trumpet, the acting sergeant-major. While strutting about amongmthe men, he preserves' always that stately reserve peculiar to half-way greatness. He is called "Old Trump," by the men. Then. there is tLe soldierly old Sergeant Trainor, you wouldn't suspect his age from his looks, who, carries about with him the quiet wathfulness of an old ' house-dog." J' ust like many an honest old sailor, regular-built and thorough-bred," said the skipper. "That big dragoon with a bold front, is Sergeant Bootlice. It is thought that he is the devil among the   76          FACA. girls; that is the best thing about the man, for he is the most overbearing of tyrants among Gte boys. Yet, with all his devil-may-care look, let him catch the eye of an officer, how obsequious! how officioLs! how whim- pering and ready! A ship's a good stage on which to view human nature played as a -farce, captain. It's as good as' a play, to view the same characters thrown so clearly under your eye in different circumstances of power and dependence; yet the worst to show off their nobler qualities. You should see them ir the field. "Here comes the sergeant, O'Connor, who presides over the regions below, where the provisions are laid out for daily use. He deals out " rations in bulk " to the cook's corporal ; there are so many men to be fed they require a corporalto make it his business. Sergeant O'Connor delights in a business-like bustling manne-, never so con- sequential; now holding a memorandum book and pen- cil. in hand, and now wielding a hatchet or tap-borer, as if triumphantly elate in what constitutes the happiness of the troops -their grub. Had we a legion of honor, O'Connor would .now be wearing  his star for gallant conduct at Contreras. "The cook's corporal, O'Rourke, may be seen forward there, insensible to the charms of violin and itrombone, intent on his own musical department, the galley. ' There 's music in the female voice; There 's music in the lyre;   BURNT   POKER    PORTRAITS.     " There 's music in the coffee-pot A boiling on the fire.' "He deserted the fl sh-pots, however at Buena Vista, and fought like a dev'il.  "The corporal's four cooks delight in their greasy, black, grimy aspect, and set police regulations at open defiance as to personal appearance. But that corporal is fascinating; he is a tall person, and has a mouth with a continual smack on- it, as if always employed tasting the ,men's bean-soup. He overlooks the cooks at their labors, as they wind around each other and dis- appear in the steam of the kettles, very much as a tall crane might regard a nest of eels on some misty morn- ing; the men call him ' Forks.' "Other non-commissioned officers of the command are chiefly distinguishable for their voices, bass, tenor, con- tralto, falsetto,; and variously suggestive of big manli- ness or young boyishness, and rank, and consequence. The little brisk Irisl corporal, withl a fiery red head, has an abominable squeak.  Yon tall dragoon, a thun- dering cannon; he was in May's charge." Old Sol was now called off on duty. But with our reader's consent we will take his place at the skipper's elbow and the reader's ear. The music ceases. Cert'ain of the non-commissioned officers fly about forming the ranks; others are driving the men down below for drill, or some other dire pur- 7                 r !

It is laughable to see them now, swaying to and fro, and keeping their legs as best they can, as the rolls are calling, and the ship begins to feel the rocking mo- tion of some long Swell that comes from heaven knows where! the last wreck, perhaps. As for the sailors, they revel in mischief: they take pains to let slip the soldiers' clothing, across the ropes to dry. One tarry imp with a 'skull-cap, a skin-tight shirt, and patches sewed to ibhis legs for breeches, while swinging between the masts and   balanced by a tar- bucket, very innocently lets fall a rope, or splash of tar on   the head of a( strutting sentinel, or some other drowsy unexpectant.  The mustachiod dragoon feels tile adhesive black coloring matter on his mustache, and looks up fiercely and swears. Now one catches the grinny stain upon his cheek, and shoots off to the officer of the day amid the jeers of comrades.

Having told all -hey know, they begin to tell what they believe, whence comes con- troversy; the next and last step thereafter is puns-- say the sixth or seventh day; this was the fifth Clay, and the point at issue was Unitarianism. Old Sol was a warm Unitarian. "Christopher, sir!" ejaculated the major, "Unitarian- ism  is lahomletanism-only without Mahomet; the play of Hamlet with the part of Hamlet left out; in short, emphatically, sir, it is Christianity without the Gad Christ!" "I don't know much about theology," said Captain Handsallaro nd, " but if a man will only act up to what he believes, he'll go right straighlt to heaven, and no one will ask him a question on the road.

This opinion Mr. Bardolph took care to foster among the me:-i although he made no such attempt upon the good sense of the officers; he told Sergeant Trainer that Corporal Marshal was confined for drunkenness. Poor Faca! she had not surrendered her little heart to William, but she was fas; driving towards that rock on which so many women, stronger and wiser than she, have split, an imprudent lore; she did not, believe Mr. B&rdolph's first story ; she scorned to believe the last.

IWORDSWORTH, HE had borne the title during the past ten years. Le:j it not be supposed that Old Sol was really intent in self-sacrifice at the shrine of Love. It was not alone to save Faca that he had resolved to marry her; but it :was to have a companion to whom he might tell his sor- ,rows. A man with a grievance is a bore among men, but a martyr and a hero among women; at any rate he can tell his grievances to his wife, and be listened to possibly with a degree of pleasure. And Sol had a grievarce; it was slow promotion. I:s West Point comrades were captains, even majors; *.his fellow-officers had been breveted on fields where h le had been no less distinguished, on the spot, though sless so at the seat of government. Officers had even been breveted for staying at home during the war, and none of Old Sol's age were left of Old Sol's rank. Poor Old Sol!    96           ACA. No greater blight can fall on the flower of human happiness than hope too long deferred; and surely blight had fallen on the veteran lieutenant: it falls on many, not the dull contented ones, but the bright, eager, and lofty, panting for fame. Here he had stood in the whirl, the keen high wind of the new time blowing on others all around him. The activity of men and wo- men in civil life crowned with all earthly honors, he be-i held--but afar'! Not his to enter the arena! his pro- fession excluded him in a manner; and here, in his profession he was rusting useless, neglected, away. Pro- motion! promotion! give men promotion, or they die! -But need of sympathy was not Sol's only motive to perpetri'ate matrimony. To tell the truth, he liked the sex better than he made believe to others, or even ad- mitted to himself; but he was afraid of them,--gar- rison beauties, or watering-place belles, fast young wo- men that are on the wing away from home mostly, strong-minded women, who stand ready to throw a book, at your -head, or bore you witlh' toutomon-tootletittlt- tootle-traddle-ology, or drag you to the fashionable and brilliant scoffers' lecture, or harangue you on homeo- pathy, send you her compliments with a box of globules and a copy of her verses-Old Sol had fallen deeply in love with Faca Trainor, simply because she was not one of these. Besides she had been brought up modestly in the   THE  FATHER   OF  LIEUTENANT'S;    97: army, and would prove not only a meet helpmate, but a gc-od te nt-nate; she was accustomed to poverty, and co ild live on Old Sol's pay.

She had no great house at home for which to pine; she "knew of ing relation in the world save her parents; she iWLS pretty, beautiful, on the severest models of beauty. "In short," thought So8 to himself, cologning his ,handkerchief, and shaking it till the perfume filled his state-room, "it's a capital arrangement all around,-and the father of lieutenants -ha! ha! the mess go to the deuce--is on the highway to happiness at last! IBut supposing she refuses? Whew! Yet, she cannot, [she won't refuse me, me nearly, a captain, though I've }been that a whole eternity. Her father, her mother wi1l not let her." Qld Sol paused and reflected a long time, with a long land earnest face.

I THE C-ULF STREAN. "Do you notice that change in the color of the water?  asked the skipper of an officer. " Yes, what is the cause of it? ' "The Gulf Stream; we crossed it last night, sailed. eastward on the long tack. Those lines of sea-weed mark the presence of it." The sea-weed appeared like grape-vines trailing over the water, heavy with multitudes of clustering fruit. An almnost continuous series of lines are thus formed, stretclhing from the Stormy Gulf nearly to Labrador. Here and there a flying-fish scooted from ,wave; to wave, crossing the sea-wee4l n light wing, pursued by golden dolphin, or intent of sport. "Off Hatteras," said the skipper, "the stream is about seventy-five miles wide, spreading as it advances north'ard, and diminishing in temperature and swift- ness ; there is no constancy in it; at the same point the temperature may vary from five to eight degrees warmer than the adjoining waters, and the current from one to three knots. The sea-sparkles which you have noticed   106 -         ACA. on the sides of the ship are not witnessed in the Gulf Stream, except with a bleeze from the south-east." "How do you account for this wonderful Gulf Stream, Captain?" drawled out Nebulus. "I do not pretend to." "In the absence of Clincher," said Major June with one of his rosiest smiles, I will try." ".Do!" exclaimed Swallow eagerly. "The Gulf Stream," said Major June, in the manner of a school-boy, " rises in the Equator and empties into Symms' Hole; it is bounded, North by the Aurora Borealis, South by Colonel Kinney's Expedition, East by the savlns of Europe, and West by Lieutenant Maury.

It went into the Ark with Noah, and came out of the Crys- tal Palace with Mr. Barnum, who has contracted to ex- hibit it at his next Baby Show, where he will baptize young America in its waters." The major paused, and looked pleased at the manner in which his recitation had been received; Swallowr only wore a dubious expression.

"BuT I don 't understand," said 5Major June to Clincher and Junks, as the three sat on the forecastle- deck, "I don't understand how it happens that the sailors are so easily duped by those imposters you speak of; many of them certainly appear to be intelligenit men." "No ,matter for all that, sir," said Clincher, "poor Q Jack goes ashore with pockets full of money, maybe was paid off 'board a man-o'-war, two or three hundred dollars.

But the boarding-master comes to him with some new yarn, 'just had the old house fitted up fresh; don't take any more hard cases to lodge; lkeeps a good respectable home for poor Jack-full, to be sure - but just to accommodate an old friend, and keep him out of difficulty, and prevent his losing his money, he'll just take him, seein' he's a particular friend; 10 T   "O          F A A. don 't like'to be bothered by too many, but as its iam, why ---"  "Thinking it all just so, Jack goes to the house, de- posits his cLink in the hands of this friend of his'n, and they get him drunk first thing, add before they let him loose they swarab it all out of him clean." "That 's not aw, sir," said Junks; " when I came home 'board the man-o'-war, we were paid off at Norfolk.: Six of us, chumloies, came to New York together- we qrn 't aw chummies either, but shipmates, you see, be.. cause only two are chummies, -took a carriage from the Jersey Ferry to ride up in style; prevailed on 'em to go with bre to the Sailors' Home, and they'd agreed; stopped there before, and knew they sold no rum.

"Do? raise the devil and break things! complain to the police! tear down the house! raise a mob! seek re- dress or revenge!" said the major, starting up and shaking his cane.     ; "Hardly, sir," quoth Junks, laughing at the major's excitement; they'd just turn round, and thank 'em for taking such good care of 'em. Theywouldn't do it right off, perhaps; liked as not they'd git mad, and haze and storm; but the boardin'-master would show 'em their bill: 'here's a basket of champagne;' Jack scratches his head,; ' here's a " dinner for twenty;"Jack stares; ' here's " breakage, ten dollars ; Jack remembers none of it. But the boarding-master brings up a man who 'does remember,' and who ' saw Jack invite many more, and give- a dinner, and they aw got drunk, and, if 't hadn 't been for the good care of the friendly boardin' master, the bill would have been three times as big, and Jack in jail besides.' Jack is dumbfoundered!" A long time the pItying major mused. "Good thing, I should think, for sailors to marry then," was the ma- jor's conclusion aloud.  Clincher had gone aft; Junks had become confiden- '           k '   "2          FA C A. tial, a quality in which sailors are never lacking: "I 've got a gpw, sir; I ve dreamed of that 'ere gaw now three nights, hand-running..'

"Married?" asked the major., "Lord, no, sir!" replied the blushing lover, "Ive not knowr her but three days; but  engaged." Clincher soon returned with a look of unusual grav- ity "I wish, sir, you'd issue an order about the soldiers falling dowrn." "Why, what is the matter, Mr. Clincher?" -"The ship give a lurch just now, sir, and a man was pitched over, head-first, and struck against a bunk; the board happened to be a little the softest, and split; so now every soldier about the ship will be staving in the bunks with their heads, if you don'j issue an order against their falling down." Junks tittered; the major went aft; the surgeon re- ported that the soldier had been thrown against the bunk with such violence as to render h'm insensible. Imperturbable Clincher!   CHA?T E    XXII.

"Ah! then you favor my ardent respectful suit no longer, sergeant?"     -.    i    'Personally, I must say I do; for my daughter's sake I must say I' don 't." It is a shock, Sergeant Trainor, a severe blow to my happiness to have my cherished hopes nipped untimely -so!" and Mr. Bardolph went to the hen-coop, sezed a young chicken, and wrung off its head with malig- nant energy.  "Here," said. the forlorn lover, "is my mortal existence," flinging down the carcass, "and there is my soul, my life, my only hopes of happiness," a(cnd the wretched man tossed the head into the sea. Old Sergeant Trainer knew not whether to laugh at  the drollery of this freakish acting, or to weep at the violence of the polite Mr. Bardolph's grief.   On the whole the good sergeant felt sorry for the discarded drum-major.  "You. wouldn't blame me if you' knew," said the ser- geant, pausing as if considering the propriety of dis- 107              t -so!" and Mr. 'ardolph went to the hellwotip, sexed / a y nant ellergy.

The drum-major was silent, eager as he was to learn the cause, sure that some other hand had spoiled his game, yet, he had more cunning than to put old Sergeant Trainor on his grard by asking any questions. "I kr-Lw I shall lose her, for how can an officer ever belower himself to the company of a sergeant?" "Ha. an officer!" said the drum-major to himself. , She will, perhaps, be too prolid to own her old father and m-,her. No, no!" said he;, shaking his head and flinging out the tears, "Faca's too good a girl for that; she's been educated fit for a lady, Iut she loves her old parents as much as ever. Mr. Bardolph continued silent, but his eyes glistened, and there was a'satanic play of his sharp-cut mouth, terrible to witness. "I had rather Faca would marry in the ranks,'" said the fat}er, " but such a good cLance for her--besides her mother ---" "Who the deuce is this oficer?"' questioned Mr. Bardolph to himself. "Whoever Le is, he don't catch the girl so easy."

"Then hoe don't drink?" ":No, sir; he;'s as sober and worthy a young man as there is in the regiment, or in the whole American army." The sergeant could only stay long enough to grasp and shake Mr. Bardolph's hand vigorously between both his own.           , "I'll run and tell the old woman, and Faca, and Constanza." "My dear, dear sir," said Mr. Bardolph, returning the shake warmly, "you see my friendship for you and yours. It is some consolation, after having done wrong for the sake of my love, to do right for the sake of my ' friendship. I feel I may now ask who the happy son- in-law is to be?

An, hour afterwards Corporal Marshal was released from the calaboose, and that evening, at sunset, was seen with his small guitar, standing [n a certain corner- singing ditties to a certain grand ramma and grand, daughter. The drum-major hovered here and there in unusually fine spirits. He knew what he was Ibout, as gentlemen with bushy beards and thin-cut lips requently do. ok, '            ..    CHAPTER bXXIII. FORT MFFLIN. AT this point of our narrative, we must beg the read- er to jump overboard with us, mount upon the back of a dolphin, and go ashore for the brief space of a. few chapters. At the junction of the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers there is a large region of fen-land, patches of which, here and there, have been reclaimed and converted into- agricultural uses by means of dykes. 'The portions not reclaimed are swarming with reed-birds, sportsmen, musquitos, fen-ducks, fen-crickets, and other fen-fowl and fen insect creatures, all which make the neighbor- hood resound with fen-noises, and'fen-bites. Thisde- lightful corner of the globe rejoides in the name of Mud Island. Besides the farmers who cultivate dykes, raise cattle on the meadows, and shoot reed-birdsi or ortolans in the marshes, Mud Island is chiefly occupied by a pest- house and a fort; the pest-house is known, to seamen and landsmen as The Lazaretto, and the fort is cele- brated in American history as Fort iifflin. It is upon Fort Mifflin that we Wish to concentrate the  '.       I   "8         FPACA. attention of our readers. Its outsidel is of eartlheln- work, whose grassy ramparts falelost hide the brick quarters from the traveller journeyinag by. It standls, or lies, no matter which, enveloped in its green mantle, at the southe'rn cxtiemity of the island, comminanding by its impertinent loking .guns, (whlose lips are turned up like the black lips of bull-dogs,) the channels of both rivers that flow peacefully down rippling at its feet. It is hlot iaked of historic associations, complaisant to remember, nor is there wanting its mysterious legend of a British man-o'-war, that was caught in a cross channel behind the fort, grounded and captured, but. which fiequently appears, a phalitom-ship, in dim moon- light nights, manned by spectre British tars, and com-  manded by a tall, guant figure, in cocked-hat and quan- tities of tarnished .gold lace, with a marvellously large speaking-trumpet il his haild.; And the wind, as it rata ties the halyards of the flagstaff that peers up from a -bastion, makes many a sound of orders that must; have issued from the marvellous speaking-trumpet, and noises of rattling ropes and cracking timbers and even guns and cannonades are heard, that must have been dis- charged from the phantom-ship. But it is not with his- tory or legend that we have to do. Less than a quarter of a century ago, there lay at the wharf of Fort Mifflin a steamer disembarking troops-- a company of infantry. The work had recently been evacuated by another company, hurriedly ordered off to   L  I                 .  e'   I  ,F ORT 31 IF F LIN.   1.M19 the Florida war, and thus forced to leave the quarters and the gardens in an untidy and cheerless condition- even for such a cheerless spot. The young quarter-' master, sent up Jo reconnoiter - had returned with a wrathful visage, reporting that the rooms were littered with straw from the emptied bedding, the parade ground was a mere heap of rubbish, the gardens were sprinkled over with bits of glass, and reeked with smell of turpen- tine and other. vile stenches, worthy a place upon the catalogue of Cleridges "Two-and-Seventy 'i in Cologne, and the hospital, he said, was filled with .invalids left behind, to the mercy of musquitos and the care of a civil physician in the city, seven miles away: This was certainly a promising istate of things; but the men-were disembarked with their muskets and knap- sacks, which/ they stacked uponl the wharf; their boxes and camp kettles, were hoisted over to -them, and the women and children got ashore as best they could, while the enigine ejaculatged short, impatient, huffy sounds, as if half mad; and the polite polite officers of the steamer, anxious to be rid of their freight, get their pay, arid be off, were hustRing .and jostling the poor -camp women without stint or mercy. Among the female ranks of this army of occupation was one pale creature, an\ officer's lady, who was carried ashore in a litter by tender-handed and gently-moving soldiers, attended, by a tall, sallow-faced officer of noble   120          FACA. bearing, and followed by a tall, dark, duenna-like numme The sad procession wound its way up to a bridge which crossed, the moat, and disappeared through the sally- port beyond; then, in a few minutes, the officers and soldiers re-appeared, the steamner gave a sea-snort, the soldiers gave three cheers to the crew, the crew gave three cheers to the soldiers, the steamer gave a fe v still more huffy puffs and went barking off, and the soldiers strapped on their knapsacks, shouldered their muskets, and marched up the winding road, over the bridge, and into the sally-port, to the fife and drum music ok The Campbells are coming!  Hi-yo! hi-yo!: That merry music was a god-send to the place; and how it flew into the air, and- among the willow trees, and over the ramparts, rattling down among the reed birds like mustard-seed shot.

Out they came, first angular and sharp, growing round as they ascended, then spiral, then vortical, and finally floated off in wreaths of per- petual, vortical, celestial, spiritual." And the sober drummer walked like a well-proportioned alderman in procession, steady enough for a while, till he too, grew excited, and commenced such a rolling and hoppir g and 'See Swedenborg.

HOW LITTLE FACA CAME INTO THE WORLD. WHiTHER it was before the doctor came or after the doctor came, the domestic authorities do not agree. But it was up stairs, and the duenna Constanza was there and Mrs. Trainer, the sergeant's wife; and the husband, Captain Poe, was below, writing till Constanza came. This woman, for' aught that appeared, might be a Spanish gipsey, or la Bedouin, or Moorish woman, so dark her strange face, so peculiar her dress; or, she might be a cloud from the desert, standing at the door of the wandering sdldiers tabernacle. "Senor captain, the senora is sick e "Good God! in this unhealthy spot " The duenna's hainds were folded across her breast, she bowed coldly and was silent. The captain's fingers dropped the pen and played idly with his glassy hair. "The doctor, sendr captain." "Yes! yes! I will send for him, good God! yes." The captain hastened to the fiont door, and called for: the orderly, who promptly came and stood at attention before his commanderi till he received his orders, when   ILILTLE  FACA.        123 he marched stiffly but rapidly towards the quarter-mas- ter's office. The quarter-master sent for the quarter- master-sergeant, who sent for the ostler, who saddled a wheezy horse, andi the orderly galloped and halted on the wheezy horse, Jill he reached the city where the civil physician dwelt, and in four hours time, he was at the bedside with the dark-visaged Constanza and Sergeant Trainor's wife. Again the tall, 'dark duenna stood like a cloud at the captain's door; "Lhe senora has a child, captain." Suddenly the. pen dropped. "And Francisca?" he inquired huskily. "Is very sick, senor." "In such! a place as this!" he cried bitterly. "See Constanza! since we came ten of my men have been taken with a dreadful fever, one has died, another will soon die,-and now, my wife, my angelic Francisca! my darling Fanny! But is the child alive, Constanza?  "It is, senor captain." - "A boy or a girl?" "A girl, senor." "Thank God! No, no! that would be selfish,--  would it not, good Constanza? A girl, the'- image, the companion of my Frances, how happy sh all we all be with her. But to bring her up in the'army, to drag her from pillar to post, half-educated, wild; mas-   124  I    , :  ACA. culine, hardened, giddy, spoilt; no, no! 1 would it were a boy!   ' "uWhy did el senor capitan bring my Francisca in the army?" exclaimed the duenna: wild and harsh was her voice. "Why tear Iter away from her people, her warm country, the holy church "- Constanza crossed herself--"to banish her among Americans, the Pro- testants, the rude soldados?" The captain turned his 'face away from the dark du- enna, and held his hands upward as if to avert a storm. "To blame! to blame!" he cried.. Constanza heard the doctor's footstep on the stairway and withdrew, reproachfully glancing at Ithe unfornate self-criminal before her. She flung the robosa over her shoulders, enveloping her head deep in its folds, and bowing to the physician as she passed him, went up to the sick-room. It was Mrs. Trainor, a bunchy and bustling littlewo- man who performed the first offices to the little Faca, thus stormly announced. She held -the infan- on her lap, and, as the door opened, raised her apron to shield the diminutive thing from the rude draught of air which the cloud brought with her. The cloud came and gazed thoughtfully over the child, as Mrs. Trainer continued to dress it, then went to the bed where the mother lay, and after adjusting the covering more snugly around 'the invalid, who re- (   e "TTLE  FACA.        125   a warded her with a sweet, wan smile, and after stuffing some material unknown into the wide cracks which gaped between the wall and the window, letting, in the damp air from the fen; she stole again softly to the bedsidei kissed Francisca on the forehead, and sat down watching her beloved ward, with a rapturous and mo- therly interest. Then little Faca was dressed, and Mrs. Trainor had some nourishment to make for one or other of the help- less ones, and called to Constanza gently. Constanza arose and took the child, and sat down by the fire, and sang to it in a low, wild monotone, as it lay there, a wee thing, on her broad lap; then she looked tenderly down, upon it, ceasing her chant and kissing it now, and again and the tears fell down upon the little one's blanket. -So it appears there was not only warm sunshine behind the cloud, but nourishing rain likewise. Meantime, the captain below consulted with the phy- sician. The child had come. a month or two before :its time, but the doctor gave encouragement to the father, that both mother and. child were doing well, and he hoped they might live. "Yes, sir," said the captain, low and mournfully, "but if ore must go, let it be the infant." "God knows what's best," replied the physician curtly. "But, concerning the crevasse, captain, it must be filled, or the whole country will suffer. - My patients n    126          PACA. in the hospital are growing worse, sir; fevers of more virulent character are coming upon us -hick and fast, Sir." The captain arose from his chair witl a heavy sigl, and began walking up and down the apartment, tossing his arms wearily, and wringing his hands absently to- gether. "Sir," said he to the physician, "1 I have done, and still am doing, all in my power. During the inter- val between our arrival and the departure of the late command, the banks of course could no-, be watched, and the water animals have been at work.  As soon as the water broke through, sir, I reported tho fact to the department, telling them I had not sufficient force, and no money; to stay this damage. I pointed out the con- sequence; this overflow, which is now making the air so malarious -that it was in the highest degree important to both the health of the garrison and of the whole neigh- borhood, with so much rank vegetation   unharvested, and exposed to th6 alternate heat of ar. August sun, and the influence of the tide sweeping in and out: I even suggested, doctor, that in a dollars-and-eents point' of view, the repairs should be effected at once. But all to little purpose. It is a mlonth since I wrote; they got my letter in twelve hours. I have written again and again, but they do nothing for me." The Captain sat down, wretched; his hands dropped between his knees, as he continued, almost as if solilo-   "TTLE    PACA.       127 quising': "My poor wife; my brave men, who have marched many a night thllrough the Florida everglades uncomplaining, giving up here, in sight of a wealthy city, in mute despair.

"A man!" he wlhispered between his teeth; "-you know not to whom .you speak; my constitution is broken; a few more snappings of the  cords, and the Florida campaigns will Llave done their worst.

"Why, man, you are chicken-hlearted." "Do not say that, si; in one quality I am not lack- ing."  The captain glanced at his swoiad, which stood by in the corner, reposing onlaurels won in Florida. "Well, well," said the doctor, coloringr but changing his tone to one of imore respect, "comne let us go see youf little hcir He .      . ! , [   128         FACA. The- good physician drew the captain's hand across his arm, and the two ascended to the' siek room. ( Comeome,me, said he, going up the stairway, " there is good in store for. you, and your wife, and all your men: the first bite. of frost, will cut things up, and I dare say you 'll all be well again. Come, come." They entered Whe apartment on tip-toe, and not long afterwards came down again looking less unhappy. An absent-mindied man was the doctor; he stuffed a napkin into his br6ast for a handkerchief and wore the captain's dress cap away in place of his civil black hat; but he was a kind 'old man for all that. On the following day the physician came again, and he continued to come, day after day, g'ving doubtful but not cheerless tidings to the heart of the distressed father, And so a week went on, and mother and child were pronounced to be safe. It was on this, the most happy day, that the captain accompanied the doctor a little way beyond the fort, towards the city. The sun was shining with unusual splendor, th willow trees 'waved their long slender arms in the breeze, the water and all nature looked bright, yet the sentinel noted the pace of his tonce proud-bearing chief, how heavy and slow and weak it .was, as he went out ltaning on the physician's arm, smiling half happily. He smote the end of his musket gaily, and presented arms with unu- sual alacrity.    129 "TTLE  FBAA.        129 In a little while the captain returned. The sentinel saw him sta'ger as he passed; then he saw him fall heavily in the middle of the parade-ground. He ran to his help, and amused the guard, who quickly came and bore their beloved comniander to his quarters. The doctor was soon back on the spot; but there was a heat on the captain's head; the sun had smitten him' to the earth with a great stroke, - so the soldiers thought and said; but the doctor knew it was the malaria, and with- out coming back to his senses, without bidding Fran- cisca or Faca farewell, his noble spirit fled away. Constanza lay all night, and the next day, watching by his corpse in the room below, where she had so sharply reproached him, till the soldiers came and took him away, and buried him in the field beyond the moat, with music and firings and many, many tears. "*           .   CHAPTER. XXV-. THE CREVASSE. YES, the noble commadder had done all in his power, and he was a man of many resources, ,o stay the huge tide pouring through the crevasse, and overflowing all the fields around; the meadows, and the potato and corn fields, and so cause the malaria and the deathlto cease.  Among other expedients he had called, the people of the neighborhood together, and laid before them the state of the case. One man was bound by the signing of a contract to keep a particular dyke in good repair for the protection of his own property. But he was a ion-resident, and his "property" had rot yielded well that year, so he was inclined to let matters go their worst gait.        .          ' The neighbors thought that "Uncle Sam" should shoulder the burden alone, as it was his fort and his people that suffered first: and worst of all, and better than that, he could afford it. One man, fond of sporting, proposed a war of exter- mination on musk-rats; and some one thing and some another.  One threw a stick in the torrent and watched it whirl out of sight.   TE  CREVASSE.         131 Another ejected from his sagacious mouth, after much twisting and turning, as if about to utter a satisfactory solution- a yoluminous decoction of tobacco, and was ominously sildnt. An action of tresspass for damages was proposed. The common law was wisely and learnedly quoted. The statute law of Pennsylvania, in Colonial times, was pleaded. At last a proposition satisfactory to all parties was made, and the inquest of view adjourned to a little house near thb Lazaretto, to take a drink of " old rye." After ,the drinking was donei one of these deliberate neighbors stole over to the fort, with much circumspection, there was some malice felt towards the fort, and entered the captain's quarters. "The trouble is," said he, "there are no gentlemen left; now our family,", he continued, pulling up a down- fallen and exceeding soiled collar, "is the only one left that may be called decidedly genteel." The captain stared at the creature. He was a long man, with a faded eye, and dissipated world-worn ma/n- ncr, despising the superfluity of a coat in warm weather; his shoes werl run down at the heels, his breeches bore evidence of .hiving laid in sundry untidy plhaces, his hat was shocking,I and his shirt unwashed for an age.  The best evidence he offered of the truth of his "genteel blood" was g mouth, well, and even aristocratically drawn down at the corners, and a nose turned daintily   132     '    rACA. up. Besides the man was effiminate and carried a greasy pillow about, whereon to sit, when fence or stone might offer; for true aristocrat, he was confessedly lazy. "Yes, the gentlemen of the neighborhood are gradu- ally thinning out," said this scion of high birth. "Tom Hazledean, and I are the very last of -he ancient stock, and Tom's father shot my father in a duel, and Tom's father died soon after in another. Duelling's only fit for yentlemen," he added par parenthesis. "But they would have fixed this little matter of your's about the crevasses, in no time. Indeed I 've tried my best to bring these neighbors of mine, as I have to call them, to the point, yet they won't do anything for me. They have a little prejudice against me," he mused thoughtfully, "on account of some paltry pecuniary affairs on my hands; but a gentleman is not to be annoyed about such trifles as a few dollars, this side or that, you know."- "Well sir," asked the captain 'impatiently, "what may I infer from the honor of this visit? Time is pre- cious to me,but if you have any proposition-- " "No particular proposition, captain, only its my opinion, all these farmers are to be had." "Had?"   :       .

The captain looked fixedly at the man. -His eyes fell.  The captain arose, took the creature by thee arm, walked him i tk te door, called the guard, and the " only gen- tlemran it the whole neighborhood" was ceremoniously conducted away from Fort Mifflin. The letters, which firom time to time went forth call- ing for help to the sick and, dying garrison, :were addressed to the Red Tape Bureau, by the Bed Tape Bureau they were referred to the Paper Bureau, by the Paper Bureau, they were tossed to the Brick and Mortar Bureau, from the Brick and Mortar Bureau they went' flying back whence they came and found no rest, and the soldiers went on dying. These things, impossible in any other epoch, occurred urings the reign of King Andrew the Good and Great. And when King Andrew heard of the death of that valuable officer and ornament of the service, our noble  friend the captain, and the cause thereof, he:was very- wroth, and summoned into his presence all those men of note, to ,;it: the head of the Red Tape Bureau, the ead of the Paper Bureau, and the head of the Brick and Mortar Bureau, and after a patient hearing of their c-amor, and fit animadversion on all these delinquents, hA decided that the Brick and Mortar Bureau should at oace cause the crevasse to be stopped, and to that effect  slould bring to bear all the power of that mighty de- partment. Then General Mortar commanded Lieuten-  [ ; '12  .

Accordingly, Lieutenant Brick, with a party of divers men, a Gunteris chain, a theodolite, a level, a-tape-yardi, and other instrument; of admeastre- ment, proceeded to the spot, and, after regaling himself with meet refreshments, the gallant Lie'tenant made an elaborate survey, and drew up a painted map, set forth with many words, signs, and figures, together with a voluminous report, all of which, duly endorsed and enveloped according to printed directions, were forwarded to General Mortar; whereupon the distinguished and scientific veteran sent another lieutenant, a man upon whom he leaned, to the crevasse, to see whether Lieu- tenant Brick's mieconnoisance and repot were proper to be acted upon; which confidential office having reported favorably, it was resolved by the Brick and Mortar Bu- reau that, if possible, a compromise should at once be proposed to the farmers, by whose default it was that the bank broke away, and meantime to consider soberly what should be done in case the farmers proved incor- rigible. While all was thus regularly, proceeding, according to established form and well-digested regulation, man after-man, strong, muscular soldiers, ardent recruits and tried veterans, were carried out with muffled drum and ') !

"None," cried the duenna, with a stifled groan. "Now, it crouches beneath his picture. That shadow now on his brow, so dark, so pale, it drops across his breast.

"THEN I am too late ." exclaimed the physician.  "Yes, alas! too late!" replied the young quarter- master, and now only officer, at Fort Mifflin, as he brushed away a tear.   . "Confound the wind, and boat, and everything!" "Confound the crevasses first, doctor." "Yes, confound the crevasses, and everybody, and everything connnected with them and resulting from them. I have -been two hours crossing the river in the boat, when, had it not been for the crevasse, I should have ridden down here on horseback in time, perjlaps, to have saved the lady." "I wish I knew what to do in this sad case, doctor," said the young officer,--his name was Soldan ;-- he was a tall, awkward, shy youth, newly graduated from r the military academy, thus thrown into circumstances of distress and responsibility. He then went on to avow to the good gruff physician his belief, that the [ lady of his late commanding officer had suffered for the want of common nourishment; so difficult to be procured by strangers.

The child Faca, was cradled in a gun-box, to which the company carpenter had added a pair of rude rock- els.       I  Then after a year or two there was often seen, going and coming gently, and shyly, yet playfully enough, the little child, sometimes alone, sometimes with the soldiers' children, yet most often with the tall, dark, muffled duenna. Hier constant watchfulness- and devo- tion knew no limits, no relaxation, no hours of weari- ness; one would almost believe she slumbered never at her post. The officers would hush their speaking as the two came by, a little playful kitten with its wild, stately, almost fierce old dam, a very tigress, as some thouglt. Yet we see her now, beneath her close and' many-folded cap and overshadcWing head-dress, a mantle or robosa descending fiiom her shoulders, and the large crucifix hanging over her heart, upon a rosary of many beads. And ,when we behold that brow of midnight sorrow and care, where love and constancy keep watch and ward, and the dark deep shadows around her eyes, so highly arched, and mouth so stern, and the prominent thin nose, and her long ;sharp Ichin, which seems almost to quiver with deep emotion, we feel like crossing ourself and crying- - C"Come not near us for we are a stranger to thy hid-   t-                 l' THE  PET  OF, THE  GARRISON.

The officers loved her, and would fain have caressed and given gifts to her, and provided well for her, I dare say, in a more respectable way, as the world goes; but the duenna never countenanced their advances; she would snatch her away and hide her, and point to the common soldiers to divert her. These men in roulgh clothes, and great beards, and big voices,--to them she was the light of the garrison. One would come and ask to walk with her, or carry her round the green ramparts. Tley would catch the little brightscarlet fish that swam in .the moat, and put them in glass vessels for her, and make great necklaces of'their bright buttons, and deck her with their lace and epaulets and feathers, and blild little doll-houses, and carved dolls, and horses, and troops of little wooden soldiers Ion horseback, with huge black mustachios; it was considered a great privilege to do anything for little Faca; the men would always save a. few pennies on pay-day to buy nick-nacks and pretty toys for her. And there was the baker; he revelled in happiness when he could mqke little 4Faca's dark eyes open with wonder at some new device of his, in ginger- bread -some little bird or kitten, or Jack-the-giant-kil- ler, with a club-and a great head held by the Lair. This delighted! the post-baker, and made the soldiers almost JS, e ,:   f THE PET  OF  T rHE GARRISON.   147 jealous, I fear. But they did not always stay at that fort. Lieutenant Soldan, with a new captain, and the Trainors, aad the duenna, and Faca, and many other little and big people, went from one post to another; and old soldiers went, and new ones came, but all loved her more and more as she grew. The time came for her to go to school. There was a post-school taught by a good Sergeant iBoyne, who had a smattering of learning- more perhaps than any one there knew of, becausq he was well brought up and edu- cated, and grew wild, ran away, and changed his'name, er-listed, and now kept everything concealed,: so his pa- rents should not heair of him, till he could carry back substantial evidence of reform -- perhaps get a commis- sion as an officer, for his new life and good .behavior, for even Faca found out, that there were some noble- hearted, erring, and repenting, and reforming men in 'the ranks. So Sergeant Boyne taught the child to read and write, ani do little sums in arithmetic on the slate, and all other children wondered at her getting on so much faster than they. This sergeant, one Could have thought him in love with the child, he used to spend so much of his pay on her, b-ying all sorts Eof queer fairy books, and funny story bookEs, and every other nice sort; and he used'.to go out a great deal with her, when :the duena: would   "8         FACA. let him, which she did a little oftener as sh-e grew older and could not walk so far, and knew the sergeant. Many a time have we seen them sitting on the glrassy ramparts, where the bright yellow dandelions and the little starry daisies grew, all unconscious of the warlike cannon near by ;--seen them in some little nook of the bastion reading, till the sergeant would fall asleep, and Faca would steal away and pluck the beautiful flowers, and make wreaths and crown her friend all over wilh. them, or play still moreq mischievous wild pranks with him, hiding his hatin the long grass, or creeping under the pent-houses which covered the guns, woulcd awake him with a loud call, and bid him find her if he could, and he would look beneath every other great gun but the right one, pretending not to lknow. No one knew .what manner of heart beat under thlat blue jacket, - what longings, sickened hopes, and great pride all lay smothered beneath that decent demure face of his. But as Faca advanced in years she caught glimpses of it all, and more than that, to Faca he was a bit of a wag at times, as what Irish son or daughter is not? "Bless me," quoth he, " the bare stones of old Innis- fail have a smirk on 'em! 'T is a country wh:ere the faces of the tombstones themselves are not grave." "I'm sorry for it," said she.   CHAPTER     XXVIII. T4E  DRUM-MAJOR'S   DOWNY PILLOW. IN a room with his band lay the smooth Mr. Bardolph, often pointed at as the pattern of politeness to all good soldiers. So amiable a man sleeps well. Ah! he moves! possibly he dreams! Bright, doubtless are the angels that hover between the golden cherubim of Mr. Bardolph's lare of dreams- heavenly thoughts! visions of paradise! No; he is awake!   The bandmaster lies by his side, on the back side of the bunk; the two dignitaries have a bunk all to themselves. Mr. Bar- dolph looks at the bancmaster, who sleeps soundly. He raises himself partly up, throws his legs out, and stares around the room. All the band are asleep-snoring. Mr. Bardolph arises, steals across the apartment, opens the door, looks out into the passage, closes the door after him, and glides down beyond the dim lantern, finds the stairway, ascends to the ship's dispensary at the head of the stairs, puts a hley-it must have been a false key- into the padlock, which is then removed, andlthe figure of George, the mutineer, glides out and disap- pears down the stairway. Tile padlock is returned to 13:   , 1S0   ,         - r'ACA. its place, the click of the spring is heard, and Mr. Bar- dolph disappears. The two' figures crouch together in the dari' end of the passage and whisper low. a"I  ar a-most dead." "Stick it out a little longer.!' "No, I cannot. I will beg the captain's pardon to- morrow, and I know he will release me. This confine- ment and. my wounds wh kill me." "Hark ye, Jorge, the girl is lost." "Ah! you love her!" "Fool, no! but Iull nomt lose her. My rival now is an officer." "Which one? "I dot 't know. Bu-J Jesu Maria! I will have her. Nvow, I will not marry her; she shall be my mistress. Ionly want you to play ghost a little longer." At this moment the door at the opposite extremity of the passage was openel by the sentry. The ghostly figure of George advanced, at first bent down, and gra- dually erecting itself until it loomed up blocdy, pale, and terr'bly indistinct in the dim yellow ligjt of the lantern, 'efore the terrified sentry. He staggered back land half fell out of the door, and again all was still. - "You ask too much of me for a mere girl," said the ghost resuming its crouch. "Listen! for I shall whisper low. The girl is not all.   THE DRUM-MAJOR'S DOWNY PILLOW. 151 BRemember our great scheme, the thing for which we suffer, for which we lEve, our country; we shall see her free! I see it as if 't were written in words of fire on the bulwarks of this ship. And the life of this officer, whoever he may be.- I hate! him   already!- shall be the first blood shed to water he tree of our liberty." The ghost shuddered.  "Not another murder! you would not kill him in cold blood! I know what is sudden hate, what the frenzy of a, moment may do, but so deliberate! and for a girl! no, no!" "You were always too scrupulous, Jorge,"  "I cannot help that." "We shall never accomplish anything, mind you now. Behold aboard this ship, on which a lucky fate has brought us together, the fuel for kindling our insurrec- tion. But we must clear away the incombustibles first." "What are they?" "The officers;-they must all die!" whispered Mr. Bardolph. "Ha! ha!" latghed the ghost, "you're clever, you 're no small plotter. All of them, eh?" "Yes, unless  -  but never mind now. Go now. Wait; here is a flask of brandy and some craclkers." "Good!"' chuckled the ghost. "I'll stick it out, I warrant ye"  "And here is the key.'"  I   I 2         F ACA. The ghost retreated, and vanished away into his hole. Mr. Bardolph waited, listened awhile, and tLen went up, locked the door of the prison, pocketed the key and went to bed again. Wide staring awake lay he till morning, caressed by his sweet bedfellows, Passion, Hate, Fear, Remorse, Des- pair, and Horror, one coming on the, heels of another. Now the sweat stood on his forehead, as it were drops of blood; and, now, pale and exhausted, almost inanimate, but chilled to the heart, he lay shrivelled between his blankets-a human    agony.  And anon, the warm blood return ed, and Hope stood by his bedside, pointing to the past, through all its darkness, and animating him with visions in the future, more successful too, more brilliant.' lAnd the thing to do!M to dar3! beckor-ed him over the wreck of all that sweet multitude of pleasures that spring up in the path of the innocent man whose happiness is, to be!

The love of freedom is divine'; but it is a fire that "Closest kept burns worst of all." It kindles jealousies, rancors, revenges; it .knows no limit. It would burn t;e world, and sit solitary upon its cold ashes, could it buz be free. Adolfo and Jorge were early imbued witlh this fierce love. Their father, while they were yet at a tender age, was ba,nished; they went forth, with :imn, the blas- ted branches of a twithered pine.  No country owned them, no hope encouraged  them, they were friendless and poor. His books, his intercourse with the free, and his kind yet rash:; advisers had sown free sentiments into the heart of Don Ianuel Jarerq, long; long ere his country was ready, yet, fired by thef enthusiasm which,  comes with the divine instinct when it is fully awakened, he had raised his arm too soon, and fallen beneath the recoil of his own blow,  All Spain was too ssmall a prison' for him now; all the world too narrow for his desperate sons, banished from thcir beloved Cuba..

TRACKS AND TRACTS-- FAVORABLE weather! fine! veryr favorable, but a head wind!" said Captain Handsallaround coiring into the cabin at breakfast time. He was an uPndespondent man, and rubbed his hands, not as other men do, with satis- , factioan, but with hope ; an unccmmon man was the skipper. The wind had hauled a little to the west 'ard and the ship went on her course for an hour or two, and then the wind hauled back to the southward. The Bermudas were not far off. "Here we are!" ejaculated N bulus, at last out of patience, "nine days out and scarcely three day's sail from New York  I've lost six dy s at the St, Nicholas and Broadway." "well," said the devout skipper, "the dispensations of Divine Providence are unaccountable, but, patience and shuffle the cards. While the ice holds out we ll have fresh provisions." Thb skipper was a capital provider; a turkey. graced the head of the table daily. The cabin passengers were 1    "  '    *  '   TRACKS   AND  TRACTS.   1   5 even tired of fresh provisions, preserved on ice. A dish of pork and beans was hailed with a silent "three cheers'! The troops however did not complain that" way; their appetite shot ahead of their fare. A barrel of dried apples was knocked in the head. The rascals demanded, it would seem, dessert; but this is not pro- vided for in the Rules and Articles ofLWar, besides, going into the tropics at mid-summer required a little abstemiousness. This was the business of the commis- sary, who, to the evident dissatisfaction of the men, kept them a little below the regulation allowance. One lean, hungry-looking fellow, haunted the commissary; that is, he came with a quire of paper and stood near the quarter-deck, looking up at the stony-hearted com- missary, and took notes. He wore a " complaint in the New York Herald" in his very looks. But the best abused man aboard the ship is Snowhall, and many-mastered. The captain and each cabin pas- senger is his master. Clincher, Junks, the steward, the cook-all his masters. The steward calls him a mon- key, and cuffs him; Clincher kicks him; Junks ropes- ends him. While blacking the boots in the cabin the cook calls loudly for him in the galley; while he waits- on- the cook the steward wants him; and while waiting, on the steward the mates swear at him for not cleaning  the binnacle lamp . He was threatened with total banishment from the ;    -    156 iF PAoA. society of, the aristocrats in the calbin to that of the de- mocrats in the forecastle. This would have broken 1his heart; and he las manag ed, witlh all enemies around him, to maintain his position in the pantry, where he still sings Fra Diavolo, and threatens the mlates with the "Fulton Marlket, Boys.    i To relieve Snowhatl of a polmtion of his eares, an. Irish orderly was brought in to wait on the officers; but he was summarily and spontaneo lsly ejected one day with a1 the 7zair brushes flying about his ears, with which he had, it was found, made his head only too familiar already, though in a less violent manner.

One by one, however, a new hand was trouught into the little orchestra of the quarter deck, until now vthe tuneful nine, chmplete, diffused their sweetness' from under the shade of the spanker. This "band," is led by a thin! Italian withl a vil- lainous look, on the cornet-a-piston, and overlooked by a remarkably tall,G spider-legged German, on the trom- ' bone;--he carries his wind in his legs apparellntly, firom the effort they mllake in the quick parts.

Gradually they grow familiar with the M"Iarch in Nornma,' "God Save the Queen," "Partant pour la Syrie;" "Auld Lang Syne," '"Home Sweet Home," of which, the two latter delight the sol- diers most. They also begin to abound. in dirges. In short, there is hope for them now. Every evening, the Germans, the only musicians ap- parently in the world that had rather sing than fight about it, gather on the forecastle deck, and chant the hymns and choruses of the dear old faderland.. "No American," said Major June, "lif h be /true to his country, can listei to a group of Germans,; thrown by accident together, '(yet uniting their different. har- monious parts, well performed, in hearthstirring songs,) without a feeling of self, and country-self reproach. Why are we not musicians in the practical, wise, delight- ful sense of the word? Must our education forever content itself with shreds of negro melodies for -he people, and Italian trills for the so-called polite?" "Then," said Old Sol, ( in most senses we are a nu- sical nation ;  to say nothing of the music.6f " the tin; " we enjoy and appreciate, discriminate and pay for fine music as a universal pleasure -- so brief, so little call- ing for time to listen, so ennobling, so softrlling, so 1.-   158         F CAO relaxing from mammon, that it Las got to be a want with us, as we pause in our pursuits after pelf." "The fact is," said the major, " that the nation are not so much at fault as composers. Our newspapers and magazines teenm with poetry and songs-; how few that the people care to remember,! or to sing together? Of all the' tunes,' how few are there that embody words in the honey of sweet sounds, sounds' of home, love, school, state, nation? Nonsense to look for them." "If the foggy, lager-beer cranium of a German can conceive," ,replied Old Sol, "and his patient, dull pen, pronounce poetry, and set it to sociable, national music, why pr ay not our clearer, finer brain, and wider culture, do so too?" "Such songs, too, would perpetuate the union," added-  the major. "Here are some German tracts,' said the skipper to Swallow; "you will find a large package of all sorts in my state-room; they were brought on board by an agent of the Tract Society, for emigrant passengers. I always conver- myself into a marine colporteur, pro tern, and distribute them. Here are some in French, some in Spanish." "Do the emigrants read them?" "Gladly; some to while away the time, and others for the pleasure of reading their cwn native language. Now, if you want to convert the Leathen, give them to the soldiers.'  , *                . :       ;   TRACKS   AND    TRACTS,.   .  153 "I will,"' said Swallow, "but soldiers   are  not heathen." - Ain't they? O; I don't know! Well, after they reach Texas, when they have got through with them they can shift them over to the Indians." Those tracts at sea, are literally bread cast- upon the waters. Blessings on Tract Societies! Let no man think a good work ever dies, it shall return after many days. Like an arrow that disappears in the air, truth may disappear, and yet tell on the ranks of the enemy. That evening Swallow showed Maj'or June the follow- ing note: "GomMNDINo OrFFIOER, - TRUSTING you will excuse my liberty, I would ask a small favor of you, which, I trust you will grant me.

OLD SOL had despised women a I his life, because he never knew them; and like most men of that sort, he fell in love with the first specimen he examined. Faca,  the chd h he ad known formerly. I           Chance had thrown him aboard. the same ship with  i F aca, the young womin. Chance laad brought him in close contact. Pity for her pale, se seless form, interest  awakered for her recovery, sympathy felt for a genuinely  higrher character than belonged to Ler class, yet was she chained to her class; a few sentences of intercourse, a feIw, nay many bestowals of looks of curious wonder and admiration, had altogether overthrown the forces of his heart, horse, foot, artillery, and sand-bags. Lucky, most fortunate, for Old Sol, that the conquest  was made by so good, so generous a foe--superior to most women the blind god, Chance, irright have employed. And yet Faca was a woman; nay, she was almost a child in some things. She cried when William was thrown into prison; she cried when her father made known the wish of Lieutenant Soldan; she cried, and   NEW   LOVE  IN  AN OLD IIEART.    1 61; became pettish and pouted whenever he pushed the sub- ject home to her. Most girls, situated as she was, would have danced for joy, to be elevated from the ranks to ladyship, (Faca never suspected her true origin,) to the society of intelligent people, to the atmosphere of proud station and refinement.  Is rot that the way the world would reason? Yes, and very, properly too, good world. The whole thing, however, was precipitated upon-her in a moment of surprise and astonishment, and Faca saw nothing, while she felt the blinding dust, and heard, bhe racket, silly child. As she stood not far- from the quarter-deck, the day ifter Old Sol's proposal she saw that soldierly gentle- nan approaching her, and glided away out of his sight. It was evident then and thereafter that she slyly avoided tim.  In vain the old sergeant reproached. Faca always )lushed, and turned pale, at the sight of her lover. To a 'egular knowing one, a fop, a lady-killer, such as Nebu- us, the symptom would have been thought favorable; cut to honest, ignorant Old Sol, it was very painful, hilly, and killing  Achild belonging to a camp-woman had been en- rusted to Faca, while the good woman was washing her iusband's shirt below. The child in merry mood, ran rolicing about the deck. Now it danced airound one of   ' he little pigs, now it pulled the Newfoundland dog's ail, now it made faces at an officer, now it played "   162         FACA. bo-peep! with a soldier. Faca followed, endeavoring to curb its wild glee. Her attention was diverted a moment by the sight of a school of porpoises, sporting near the ship, and the child ran and perched itself over the border of the hatchway., The dangr was imminent, for the hatches opened down through all the decks, The scream of a woman turned Faca's face towards the child, but terror fastened her to the slot. Down the'quarter-deck strode Old Sol, advancing rapidly towards the rescue, but ere he gained the hatch, Faca had sprang forward, seized the infant and borne it away in safety. He blushed and stammered at something as she passed near him, and took off his hat, and looked after her'ewith heightened admiration: Poor Old Sol, he nould have given a years pay to have saved the child himself. A low laugh was heard behind the officer, who imme- diately recovered his self-possession and turned to see whence it proceeded. He discovered no one near but the polite Mr. Bardolph walking away, it could 'nt be he, gailty of such rudeness - of course not! Mr. Barpolphl's plot, whatever it was, had now a direct personal view; a figure stood prominently in the foreground, that must be swept away first of all. Again that laugh might be heard in the passage -below. "tHo! ha!"    THEE ANGEL IN TH     SHP.

CHAPTER XXXII. THE  FIRST "-   . AT a time after dinner, when -he gentlemen were isually on deck, Old Sol entered the cabin, on the way o his state-room. Faca had picked up a book belonging to the officer, mnd standing near her own state-room door, was deeply engaged perusing its contents. She did not notice Old 3ol's entrance, bLt went on reading. He paused and ;tood gazing at her many seconds. Faca was beautiful' ler figure was rather tall, and though not quite devel- )ped, perfect in its harmonious proportions. Her profile vas (as the major had said,) of the purest American ,val. The glossy black ringlets thrown back from her temples, the earnest depth of her Liquid eye, shadowed by its long fringes, like a raven s image in a willow brook; her bosom throbbing with sympathizing interiest; ler figure draped in a close-fitting dress of grey linen, with a severely s'mple white collar; her attitude and whole appearance entranced poor Old Sol.   i Then an idea seized him. It made him look ten rears younger, positively boyish. With a mischievous bright light in his eye, he stole softly towards her, and   166          FACA. ere she was aware of it Old Sol had caught a rapturous kiss. Did she scream? did she faint? did she fly 'nto the state-room and slam the door in his burning bright face? No! a moment she gathe ed herself up to her -loftiest stature, and flashed iindignation at the daring lover. Then seeing the blushing bashfulness and comic look of fright upon his features, her haughtiness relaxed into a smile. The next moment her anger came back again, and dashing the look in his face she flung -her- self into'her state-room and locked the door. Old Sol was dismayed. He picked up the book; it was Lamertine's Memoirs of my Youth." Cursing it as the cause of his puerile audacity, and then caressing it as associated 'with her, he turned 'over its leaves, vainly trying to find where Faca had become so deeply absort ed. He then listened near her door; heard her footsteps pacing to and fro in the state-room, heard t he quick rustle of her dress, but no sound from her lips. Greatly te pted was he to peep through the key-hole. He bent over towards it. Then his sense of honor, his respNct for her, even his chaste high love forbade. "No!" he said to himself scornfully, " never!" He turned to move away, and encountered the bread rosy face of Major June, and peering over his shoulder the semi-translucent look of Nebulus, grinning at him. "Upon my honor, gentlemen, I did not look through the key-hole, upon my honor!" n      -  *   '   1 CHAPTER      XXXIII.., O MEET   ME  ON  THE   SILVER   SHORE  O meet me or- the silvery shore, That glitters round the bright lagoon, j When evening murmurs gliding o 'er, t Breathe vespers to the vestal moon. O list the zephyr's breathing low, i As faint responses from a bride. And see the waters dimpling flow, Like infant pulses with the tide. Like zephyrs on the moonlit sea, Stole love upon my spirit young-- Like evening murmurs, fell on me, Soft accents melting from thy tongue: --Then meet lme on the silver shore, lMvy vows of love I will renew, And stars shall tell the story o 'er, That earliest love is ever true. Thus sang 'Will'am   to Faca in the twilight hour. Her heart fluttered as maidens' should, but was it for William, or his ditty? Ah, Faca! Faca! she seemed vacant.    Her thoughts were not here with William, she looked over the sea and S!.  r-    168      -   FAA. said nothing; but her thoughts were not roaming over ! the sea. "You did not hear a word!" said William  pe- tulantly. "I rmust confess that I did not," said she blushing. "You ,are going to marry that old Lieutenant?" "Perhaps I ain." "You will grow ashamed of me, and of your father and mother." "Possibly I may." "Then," said he, after hesitating and with much trem- bling, "you never loved me- you are too proud." "William!" she exclaimed in anger, " you do not know me:i you are always reproaching me;-- but I never gave you my love. Father, too, is always provok- ing me; you sigh and he swears, yet I have' done nothing; because I am perplexed must you all vex mo the more?" "It is easy to see that you will marry -him!" "And father says it is easy to see I never will! He cries ' General Jackson! girl you are a fool!' and you call me ' heartless.'" Faca stamped her little foot upon the deck, "good night, I will stay with you no longer," she added going. "Will you not come to-morrow evening?" he said in a distressed voice, but she was gone. I   SILVER   snORE.       169 "Dash it!" he exclaimed, "I wish I was in the Calaboose again." "Why?" asked a smooth voice. "Because, Mr. Bardolph, I am more miserable here." "You have been cut out," said the drum-major with a slight sneer. "Yes.' .  " "Would you rid yourself of your rival?" "Of course!" "Then' let us talk^ together down stairs." i ^ -   * '   ',    'CHAPTER     XXXIV.  GOING DOWN INTO THE DEEP. IN latitude 33 the sea air was delightful, and chiefly . so towards and during the evening. The officers, with the skipper in their midst, and the"; veracious Clincher within hearing, often gathered in one or other of the quarter-boats that hung, one on each side.                L The blue waves surged beneath them,!the white fleecy clouds flew over the topsails, as they glided on, the sails filled, and anon shook in the light wind, the sea-mon- sters sported around their track, the hum of the troops was stilled, and the music of the band awoe their sen- ses to a deeper gladder harmony.  ' "This is almost as" fine," said the surgeon, 'as Bayard Taylor's sailing up the :grand old Nile." As the wind grew fresher, the Aldebaran sped on more rapidly, and the summer clouds began to pile themselves up on the horizon. "Captain," said Swallow, as he looked down at the dizzy, yeasty waves, " what chance would a man have for his life if he should fall overboard nbw?"   GOING  DOWN.        171 "Very little. [ 've seen many fall overboard while a lip was in motioi, but not one saved." "I think one night keep himself up for some time." "Yes, if he we]le cool. The danger is, that persons )mmonly lose their presence of mind; the fall is sapt to ewilQer, they oover-exert themselves, lose strength, ad strangle, some times their bewilderment is surprising. nee a man fell overboard from  this ship. I had er hauled square up, let go all sails, cleared this quar- r-boat, and had a crew ready in a moment. Mean- me I threw a bu)y overboard, the mate flung another, there was one on each side of him; but he wouldn't uch either, and went down between them. Never ind the boat, sail I, he 's gone." "On my way to Mexico, with troops," said the Major, we; lay off Brazos Santiago a day or two. , There was i insane teamster on board who had given us a great al of trouble- dhristopher! more than his neck was )rth. We had to keep a guard over him to prevent 3 committing suicide. But while we were lying at chor- I heard a voice-     - "Here goes, boys; I 'm off!" and over he plunged ;o the water. "Was he drowned?" asked Swallow. "Christopher! ,sir, he no sooner smacked into the ter than --   ! goo! woo!" he cried, and began swim like a Sandwich Islander. He drifted a good   172         FACA. distance before the boat could be got down and reach him; but hydropathy cured him. "The dispensations of Divine Providence, are unac- countable i' said the skipper." "Once coming over from Liverpool, a man, a young seaman fell from the rigging. He came pitching head first, and fell not' far from where the mate stands now. There happened to be an old grey-headed sailor stand- 'ing there, who caught the young man on his shoulders. They both came to the deck, and were picked up senseless and carried into the cabin, where they were examined by a British army surgeon, who was on his way to a regiment in Canada. Under his care the young man soon recovered, but the old sailor died. Not a bone was broken in the body of the young fellow, but poor ' Old Richard' had his arms and collar-bone shivered, and got a thump on the breast which caused his death." "Wondrous chance! Or rather wondrous conduct of the gods!:'  Whispered Major June to Old Sol. "Look at the sky, gentlemen," said Nebulus. He pointed his hand towards a mass of cloud-alps, on whose jagged crags the brilliant moon was pouring a storm of blazing light. All eyes were turned that way. The ship was dart- ing through the water on the starboard tack, and the         .              .  . I   GOIN G  D OWN.        173 weather side, opposite the group of beholders, was thrown up, so that -the cloud spectacle was just visible in all its height of glory above the gunwales of the project- ing quarter-boat .In this boat, standing suddenly erect with his nose stretched upward, was the large Newfound- land dog, Lion, looking as if he were on top of one of those blazing cliffs. It was a study worthy of Land- seer. "Speaking of Iandseer," said Major June, "he is a true Pythagorean. A transmigrated soul speaks out of every animal he paints. Every previous painter of ani- mals was a heathen and an atheist compared with hi - i even Poussin himself." "Ycu know," continued the major, '; that the Indians believe in transmigration, or at least many of them do. Some tribes trace their origin to wild beasts. The Tor- keways have, now an annual feast, in which they celebrate their derivation from, or rather by means of the wolf. An account of one was given me by an Indian agent. We lay encamped on the Witchitaw. "Half a mile from this spot you'll find a good spring," he said. ' I thought no white man had ever been here before," said I. ".Let us look for the spring," was his reply.* "He arose and led me though the thick words direct to 1       '    174     .SACA. it. It was a beautiful spot, and we sat down on the green bank.                     l "I witnessed a curious sight here," said he; i I was doing some government business with the Cumanches, and a large band of Torkeways came, and seeing a white man, demanded that he should be given up to be put to death. But the old chief of the Cumanches said - "No; he is my guest; he sleeps in my lodge. I cannot give him up. "It was a dangerous refusal to make, for the Cuman- che party was small, and the Torkeways very large, and hostile to the whites. But the old chief was a brave man, and kept me under his eye all the time. Days and days we sat together in his tent, smoking, without a word uttered by either. Finally, he said he was obliged to go to a feast --of the Torkeways, for if he refused, they would take it as an insult, and I must go with' him. He disguised me as a Cumanche warrior, and put me in a corner of the Torkeway lodge with his young men, The adventure had a charm for me that no civilized ,gathering could present. "First appeared a dozen Torkeways dressed in wolf- skins, jumping on all fours-: they set up a most infer- nal howling, and then took to digging the earth with their fingers, or claws. After scratching and howling a long time they dug a man out of the earth. The man   GOING. DOWN.         175 looked wildly around him, ventured forth, and after a brief absence returned and laid himself down in the pit again : again they drew him up. - Why do you put me in this world?" said he," it is full of wild beasts; they have sharp teeth and long claws, they are jstronger; they roar and frighten mue; they will kill me, or I shall starve. Let me sleep again in the ground. "Then they put a bow and arrow in his hands, and said, 'Go now, shoot the wild animals, kill and eat everything you find.' "That was the first man," said the major smiling, "and from him we all spring; Torkeways and pale faces." The major had a simple, winning way of smiling when he told a story -it was as good as if an Indian had told it.: i   o ,' an It "It is curious," remarked Swallow, " how many the ories of the origin of mankind descend into the ground for him. Are they not all confirmations of the Bible account of Adam's creation, showing! that the true knowledge must have once extensively prevailed?" "I think so,' replied the major, " and it has always been a matter of surprise to me how Volney could have !  . ,      E    \ For this legend the author is indebted to Captain Mar, y, of the 1Un1ited States Army.       .    ,          .   176         FACA. stumbled into the blunder of drawing the opposite con- clusion.'" "I'll tell you a story now about 'going down,"' said Clincher, vainly endeavoring to straighten his slouched features into a degree of gravity becoming the conver- sation he was adorning. "Old Braddock :"-"Haw'! haw? haw!"burst out Swal- low, at once. Clincher put on an injured expression. ' Well gentlemen ----" said he retiring. "Go on, my dear fellow, go on sir," said Major June. "One day sir," said Clincher,- addressing himself to the major exclusively, but, like your true story-teller, taking care that all should hear. "One day the boys down in Essex were braggin' how deep they could dive, and how long they could stay under, and Braddock, who hated boastin,' (Clincher seemed to believe religiously in, this trait in his friend's character.) Braddock he never said nothin' till they'd all done. ' 'Well boys," said he, ,( I once had occasion to fetch up a log that had sunk in five fathom water. I just dove down to the bottom with 'a rope, a - bearded spike, and a hammer; and, while I was hammering in the spike down there, I fell fast asleep., - There, boys, I slept all through the summer, and didn't wake up till in the fall of the year. Old Joe Hunks,- the fisherman, came a spearin' eels, and stuck his speakrinto my back, that woke me up, and I came to the top of the water with rope and hammer iL my hands."   HAPTER XXXV. QATCHNG A    TARTAR. She is so well-behaved and virtuous, and something Snappish withal.          G(ETHE. OLD SOL seized the first opportunity to-make his peace with Faca.!t was when the cabin was deserted by all except himself, that he stood a faithful sentinel over her state-room door, till she appeared. Rosy with the bloom of youti, she stepped forth, her fine figure set lightly in a frame-drapery of white muslin.  "I  was very rude to you yesterday," quoth Old Sol blushing to the eyes. N!"No ruderl than I to you," she replied, frankly ex- tending her hand;  "But an attack like mine was unpardonable." "Then I pardon it for that very reason."  - "But did you not care to be kissed?" asked Sol in a slightly disappointed voice. Faca blushed deeply.  "YoL are ruder now than yesterday," she answered with emotion.  Old Sol fel her hand withdrawing from his own, 'and ,clutched at it convulsively as he said i I     *            .   .   178          'FA CA-.

Faca was moving away in silkee, when after an embarrassing moment, Old Sol exclaimed abruptly:  "That book! would you like to read it? will you lot accept it?' "O thank you!" she cried with childish eagerness. The veteran was already armed with the book, as a reserve.  "Are you not afraid of me?" inquired old Sol, as he handed Faca the book. "No. The officers have always been so kind to my parents, and when I was a child they petted me so much that I like them all, and look upon them more as elder brothers, or old uncles than any thing else." "Elder brothers! 'old uncles!' muttered Sol to himself. Faca glanced at him with a mischievous look. "But do you not feel the difference of rank, the want of social sympathy?" he asked. You are determined to remind me of tlem, I see," she replied coloring. I "You might guess at my motive,' saia Sol, with a look of admiration, i e. admiration in a confused, red state.

"I dare say you think very well of yourself" blur- ted out the indiscreet Sol. Faca laughed. "( I shall read this book with pleasure," she said gaily; "I already sympathize with the poor fisherman's daugh- ter. Would you not like to fancy yourself the youth?" Faca again started to go, and this time went. ' Coquette! vixen! Egad I've caught a Tartar!" burst from the lips of poor Old Sol.  , ,     , i    '    CHAPTER XXXVI, T HE CONSPIRATOR.

"One did last night," said the skipper. "How was it,?"

Clincher always walked aff after venturing a remark. It was very convenient for the others.

One after another descended to the bath,- and came 16  -,t   18G6          A C A-. up glowing with pleasure-genuine sea sparkles. The water was pumped up by soldiers, and poured into a bucket on the quarter-deck, which, by a short tube in its bottom, let tLe water run into a pipe communicating with the bathing-tub  The troops were likewise at their ablutions, dancing all over the ship with boyish delight.

"You had better set up nurseries and singing schools d &t once in the army," drily remarked Old Sol. e  "No I won't!" replied the major, warmly. "I don't know that I would allow more married inen in the ranks than there are already. But those few I would render comfortable and happy as possible.

( This wouldn't be a bad place to sleep such a night as this," quoth the major to Junks. "Yes sir, if 't want for the moon." ) "Then you've known :nen to be moon-struck?" [( Yes sir," replied Junks gravely, " one young man-- he was sleeping on deck with his mates, when they came to be roused up, he couldt it move-one side parawized, and his head was out of gear ever after that, when the moon came round to the same quarter." "Who is that sleeping in the quarter-boat?" "O, that's the band-mister; he brings his things up and sweeps in the boat- don't know why: perhaps its more comfortable, o perhaps he don't jibe well with his bunk-mate; that's Mr: Bardolph, I think the Sol- diers caw him." "But you don 't think the moon paralized that young fellow?" "Don't know sir, but t at's the way iti happened. I knew another chap who wras sweeping on deck one moon- Bight night with his moutlh open. When he 'woke one   190         F A C A. side of his mouth was drawn down: he never could hitch it up again. Ha! ha! sir, he Cooked funny enough. But the scurvy is the worst thing at sea, sir." "Have you ever had it?" "Never but once, sir, only among the cords of my wegs and in my mouth; gums now sore from it' sometimes. Some chaps have it mighty bad after they 've been out eight or ten months without fresh--works up to their, waists; if it gits furder up, to the heart, it keels 'em over. Some has it in their mouth till their gums aw rot, and they can jist haul out and clap in their teeth when they 're a mind to.- " Ha ha! one fellow cut away his gums with a knife, but when he got over the scurvy the gums didn't come. back, and there were the roots of his teeth aw showing, sir. Then, again, sometimes it only works inwards; don't show itself on the skin, then if a wand dand) breeze happens to strike the ship, wook out! We had a man with it once inwardly. Well when we got into Sag Harbor, yousee it was a Sunday, and a great many people came down to see their friends, and those they knowed on board, and greet 'em after the long voyage. Among others was this young man's brother. He brought a big bunch of roses in his hand to give him. The young chap was standing there at the wheel; his brother jumped aboard and came up, and as they were a shakin' hands he put  .                           ;   I SC URVY  TRICKS.        191 Athfe roses 'to his brother's nose to smell, and- he'd no sooner s elt 'ema sir, than he dropped down dead," "Great God, mate!      .. . i "s Yes, sir, 'twas the wand breeze in them roses that killed poor Tom HAw.   He fell right down in his trackd the first snuff."  ' But is there no remedy for this horrible disease?" ! "Well sir, some think tvime-juice is good; I knew on 3 fellow was cured by'it; but the old man gave him Saw there was, and the rest had none when it broke out on us. -But sometimes they bury them. "Bury them," "Yes sir; as I said before, it begins at the feet and ,runs up. i They puts 'em in a hole in the ground, and "fills in the earth up to their waists, and the earth draws the disease out." i - Dear old mother earth!" said Major June. ! You ought to hear the poor devils shriek with them yells they make, as the p&in is drawing out of them. Another good remedy, sir, I've known, is lean strips of whale flesh wrapped taut all around the body.   That :draws the scurvy out too." ' "? The-great cause of this diseae' says Elliston in hisM Praa- tice of Physic,' appears to be the waint of fresh animal and vege- StalIe food. It is on this accouLt .;that the disease was formerly very comn-on at sea, for, at one period sailors were supported with nothing but salt provisions."   , .    t From the same source we learn that, "In 1726, when. Admiral flosier sailed to the West Indies with seven ships, he buried his   192           FAcA. Notwithstanding  this and other dangers attending whaling, the worthy Junks was soon regretting to the major that he did 'nt "stay a whalin'. " I 'd a been rich," said he, " for the very ship on which I could have gone out next trip as second mate, brought home five thousand barrels of oil; my share would have been two thousand dollars.

"Lord Anson, iin the year 1741, lost one half of his crew by scurvy, in six months. i Out of nine hundred and sixty-one mei, who sailed with him, only three hundred and thirty-five were alive at the end of the year, and at the lend of the second year, only, seven- ,tyone were fit for the least duty!"   CHAPTER XXXIX. tTHE BANDMASTER SLEEPS AND WAKES. SHORTLY after the conversation detailed in the last- pages, th 3 major went below and "turned in." He: ould, not have been asleep long before he was awakened ?y the voice of a sharp quick shuffle of footsteps over- lead, on the quarter-deck. Hurriedly dressing himself, ,e was in a moment on the deck. The guard, and all -he members of the watch, together with the skipper, here standing around in a thick, jostling group, eagerly Alistening to Junks.         -  , 'What is it?" inquired Major June. "( The bandmaster, sir," replied Junks in a dejected Voice, "soon after you went below, you see, he awoke, Xnd said the moon was shining mightiard on him. re:l, he stood with me right here, looiag over the side f the ship, and talked, poor gentleiman, about his country and his friends at home, you see.

Then it just struck me what was the matter with him - sweep- ing in the mooi. "No," says I, " you 're dreaming." Then I took hold and shook lhim, and talked, and turned off his thoughts, and afraid to let him go below., as he might slip back again and do something dreadful, I told him to lie down in the quarter-boat, and go to sweep again. He laid down, after a while, and I covered his face and head with my coat. I saw him fast asweep when I went forward to rouse out the, second watch, but I'd scarce got to the main-mast when the wheelsmnan sung out--  ' Man .overboard ..!'  "I raniback and sprang to the wheel, jammed it round, fetched the wessel to, and set her all a-back; but it was too late sir; 'fore we could let down the boat, I saw him sink." "I saw him sink," repeated Junks, wiping h's eyes with the sleeve of his shirt, "and the moon shining bright on his head. I saw him going under ivater with his feet downwards as though a shot was tied tc them, standing straight-like in- the water; down he went;   THE  BANDMA STER. 9 orly his arms moved, as though he was playing the fiddle." As Junks ceased speaking, the group of listeners broke up and retired in silence. Among them was Mr. Bardolph, sorrow-stricken.   i CHAPTER XL. H OLE IN THE WALL. IAND ho! The coast of Abaco next morning lay on the star- board bow. The name is applied to a group of islands small, low, narrow, sandy. They belong to England- and the wreckers. All vessels making the Gulf from the North must round them. There is a wrecker now, sailing peacefully along, between two islets. It looks like a pilot-boat. 'This is one of the most hazardous coasts in the world," said the skipper. -"Every year it is strewn with wrecks, and this year has already given its full share. The reefs are sharp and rocky, and plenty of them. The currents are numerous, and no depen ence to be placed upon them - now scud you this way, now that. You steer for Hole-in-the-Wall, and when you feel most certain, you find yourself 'drifted off fifty miles, or come smack upon a reef, and go to pieces. That was the fate of the British ship Gallant, last year."   HOLE  IN  THE   WALL.     197 Fortunately for the Aldebaran she made the coast in the day-time, as the skipper, with all his cautious allow- ances, and the mate, with the certainty of his own peculiar "dead reckoning," foulnd themselves carried ten leagues from their course. Now, under easy can- vass, they skirt along, standing out a league or more from the treacherous coast. "Trees! houses!! plantations!!! cried Major June, looking through the spy-glass. "To think such out-of- the-way places inhabited!" "Mostly by wreckers," said the skipper. "There are said to be one or two fine sugar plantations on the chief island." "I've no doubt," quoth Old Sol, "these people think themselves quite in the world. The people of Kamschatka think the inhabitants of the United States , are outside barbarians, and despise them accordingly." "I don't see the lighthouse," .said the skipper. Now Clincher saw it, and now he swore it was dis- tant forty miles. "It stands on a bliff," said the ski?-r. "And there is the bluff,' said Major June. A tall dark -object loomed outt of the'hazy coast, but as the ship approached, it mingled with the hills, and the coast still pointed away further south. At last, afar beyond where the land apparently terminated, a aI ;,  t.   198         FA  A. C tall slenderi object might be discerned, like a chalk, mark on the mist. "That's it," said the skipper, confidently; and put- ting his hands in his breeches pocket with satisfaction, he led the way[ to dinner. Then coming back on deck, they took th3 Hole-in-the-\Wall, by Mway of dessert. There was Itie W1all black,l vertical, prison-like. A huge detached rock stands off the promontory, spanned by a heavy Saxon arch, under which rushes, and dashes, and gurgles, the big angry waves - that is the Hole. - Following up the back-bone of the promontory to a sort of bluffy eminence, the eye comes upon the light- house, of a mweather-beaten, red color; and behinc. it a little group of buildings-one of which has a cozy verandah. Near the house is a high pole, from which as the ship comes abreast, the cross of St. George is seen to fly. "Run up our colors to the peak," ordered the captain. As the beautiful folds of the red, white and blue X shook out ir. -;he-wind, "three times three " went up from those h indreds of brave men, and the band played a national air. Turning this "Cape of Good Hope,' the Aldelaranp squared away to the West, and plowed on straight before the wind. The red lighthouse fell a moment behind a hill, reappeared, and gradually sank out of sight. A   HOLE  -N  THE  WALL.      199 tall ship was passed, and dropped slowly behind, follow- ing in the wake of our winged courser, with her sails set square, and studding-sails put out, giving her the look of a high-petticoated Dutch vrow, with two milk- pails. And ere the sun sank into the sea, the Dutch- woman was drowned. ,\   v - CHAPTER XLI. THE ISAACS. A Br ! A bite! Clincher sprang to the taffrail, from which two lines had been hung out, and came tagging after the ship and skipping over the waters. Balancing himself as best he might, Clincher hauled away rap)idly. A sharp dorsal fin stood out from the waters. "A shark!" cries one. "No, a dolphin!" cries another. "Neitherl!" said the skipper. Up it came, a beautiful rainbow of a fellow, well called "Bonita," i. e., beautiful, weighing twenty pounds. While the creature was flapping and floundering on deck, Snowhall came, and planting his hands on his knees, he bent over the fish, with his eyes wild with the white dilation. I "Out of the way!" cried Clincher, "you woolly rascal! he 'd sooner bite a young nigger than anything else." Away scahpered Snowhall frightened.  On reaching the pantry he began to scratchI at his head-for, - I .   THE   ISAACS.        201 according to the veracious Clincher, it ;eas necessary to begin that performance an hour before he could get through the" wool, and cause a sensation, or as was now the case, reach to a thought. "'D rather bite a nigger than a white man," solilo- quized Snowhall, with indignation.          I "Pshaw! wait till I get that 'ere mate in New York, wid the Fulton Market boys!" Snowhall was somewhat under a cloud to-day. A watch had disappeared from  the knapsack of a drum- mer-boy, and our little colored friend was suspected. To be sure, diligent search was made in his pantry and cupboard, bunk and bedding, without result, but Snow- ball might well exclaim with the persecuted Cassio-  "Reputation! reputation! reputation! I have lost my repu- tation, I have lost the immortal part, sir, of myself, and what remains is bestial." "See " said Major June, that evening, "The summer lightning is dancing a hornpipe; no, a jig! It is:all around over the horizon.' "Now a streak balances up to Orion, crosses over to Venus, and chassees with Cassiopea." "Now," continued the old soldier, gazing intently, "there is a general set to, a star cotillion, North, South, East and West, sir! How the shy little sisters wink? and how soberly the matronly moon looks 9 The breeze plays them-the violin, and the distant thunder in yon 4..'    @    o  ,       1    /   202         - FACA. black cloud, like a negro fiddler in a dark corner, booms away on his bass viol." "And' what a clatter the ducks make," remarked Clincher. "They know we've neared the land as well as anybody." The major, thus interrupted, left off describing the star cotillion, and as he went below the mate made sig- nificant grimaces,. and tapped his forehead with his hard finger. It is so queer, that the hardest thing in this world to understand is pure simplicity, such as the major's. The light of the morning sun broke upon Great Isaac, the chieflof a series of rocks that skirt the Bahama Banks in the Northeast.. The ship had laid to, fearful of approaching these dangerous isle-.s in the night; and raising sail again at day-break, had passed Little Isaac.  T'ie troops behold here a jagged rock partly out of water, and there another, discoverable only from the white spray that dashes up from  it, gleaming with a sort of savage joy. A few miles below Great Isaac, stood out "Hen and Chickens," like the others, isolated in the midst of the sea.  Around all these little islets ]here is a great 4epth of waters, and nothing can hinder a vessel from splitting at once upon them. With these on one side, and the Gulf Stream  on the other, to drift you up-   THE   ISAACS.        203 Scylla and Charybdis-the passage for a sail-vessel into the Gulf is narrow and dangerous. "I should think a lighthouse were needed here, above all other places," said the major to the skipper. "That's so," replied the latter, "and our govern- ment has offered to put one on Great Isaac; buit the British government, with the spirit of a dog in the manger, refuse either to erect one themselves, or to let V us do it; it is surprising even, that they suffer those sea-gulls to build their nests in such numbers;--such is the jealousy of the great naval power! The wreckers. you see prowling like beasts of prey in all directions can best appreciate John Bull's churlishness. It is life to them.'  "Feesh! feesh! -broke in the wheelsman, a Nor- wegian. Captain Handsallaround seized the line, but fast, as he drew, and fast as the vessel was sailing, the fish swam faster, and came alongside., "Out of the way now!" said the. skipper as he -  gathered himself for a last jerk. "Here it is! no, not yet;--a rope in the way; now she comes," and over the bulwarks and down upon the deck, floundered a dolphin. His back was of the darkest emerald green, his sides and belly were of a dazzling gold, covered with spots of blue, purple and silver; his whole surface shimmering, and changing hues. Bleed-   204  1   -   -  FA C A. ing, alas, too freely, he soon flashed out his brilliant ex- istence. "' Tis, a pitieous sight, said M3ajor June, mournfully gazing at the, beautiful creature as the' hues of death chased each oiler over him. The dying dolphin is not a sight th be witnessed with pleasure, much less poetic rapture. As the death-pangs cause him to writhe with agony, he gasps and glares hiedously upon you, mutely reproaching and meekly dying, yet beautiful in his con- vulsive throes. Then came the Bimini Islands, a low sand group, on one of which was a wrecker settlement, where sveet potatoes, lemons, and oranges grew, for the rain descends and the warm  sun shines on all alike. Then followed a series of keys, or rocky ledges, which lie off the southern extremity of Florida, like a chevaux- dWe-frise.    - "As if her vile swamps and   Seminole everglades deserved protection!" exclaimed Old Sol. A British lighthouse appeared upon Gew Key. And here the skipper's brow grew dark, as he noticed an unfavorable change in the wind "Thati praying in the cabin," said Clincher, ( that 's o what caused it.'  The  zealous Swallow and the devout major. had  assembled the officers, camp-women, and as many others as chose to attend, to listen. to the church service. There were Faca and the Trainor's, and Corporal Mar-   i THE  ISAACS.      I 205 shal, and Mr. Bardolph with his distinct "amen!" but not the old duenna - she was alone, counting her beads X with God and the Blessed Virgin. And from sudden death "Good Lord deliver us," Mr. Bardolph prays. But towards evening the skipper's brow cleared up as the wind hauled back again. "I wouldn't have been carried up the Gulf Stream for thousands of dollars," said he. "Nor I for a million," whispered Junks, "formy gaw 's only waiting for me to get back, to be spliced on." The same destiny that parted Captain Handsallaround from his young wife and children, tore honest Junks from his sweetheart. The heart of humanity is like the throb of the sea, beating oft unheard, unseen, unknown. "Here's a health to the outward bound!" played 1 the band, and all went to rest save the sentry and watch. 18   CHAPTER XLII. A SQ-ALL ON     THE FLORIDA     REEFS. And this is in the night: --Most glorious night I Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be A sharer in the fierce and far deligh-;,  A portion of the tempest and of thee! BYRONx. TEi following day was squally.  There was a sort of feverish restiveness in the air, breaking out perpetually into squalls. It was hot squall, cold squall, cloudy squall, sun squall, windy squall, rain squall, and squall squall, all day long. Just at night the wind changed, and then came the worst squall,  In the language of Junks, ,'it first looked like a nigger's head, a little, round, black baw, it travelled like cllan-lightriing, and blew like everlastin'." The crew had- scarcely time to take in the light sails before it struck the ship. Then   the sklpper's orders, the sailors' answers, the volleys of Clincher and Junks' oaths, the rattling of ropes, the flapping of sails, the hurly-burly of troops, the  roar of; winds, the thunder of waves; but the tongues!

' There came on such a din of innarmonious sounds as a whole frantic city would make, clapping their doors and window-shutters to and 'fro, amid many voices, laughing and shrieking through the midnight air. There were clew-lines, halyards, main-top-braces, fight- ing with such rude discords as "Hell-fire'!                     x "Ay-yi, sir!'" "Soldiers, go below!"  "Stop shouting! Who the devil can give or hear an order?"' with an accompaniment kept up in a lively way on the part of jib-booms, top-sails, quacking ducks, squealing pigs, bawling officers, sea raging, wind howl-. ing, men chorusing, and above all, the dire little man with a voice, domineered with a crashing contralto, that rose, ever and anon, above the wild tumult- rose supe- rior to every emergency. Then bewildered soldiers were frightened. They echoed every command, and seized hold .on every wrong rope, till the skipper stamped his foot fiercely, and demanded in no gentle terms that they should all turn in.- Then rose the shrill and sudden tattoo, and the men were driven down below like cattle to their penfolds.   208          F AGA.  The Toi-tugas lay off the starboard quarter. This was the. last of the Florida Reefs, andi the- skipper was anxious to go by and enjoy the safe sea-room of the gulf. The change of wind occurred w:th the Tortugas Light in view, and it Was now necessary to put about and fly before the squall, away from the dangerous neighborhood. What was the consternation of all when the ship refused to wear around. There was one other resource- to box-haul her. The yards were set square aback, ant the wind drove her through the water rudder foremast, fast, thrillingly fast, towards the dreadful reef. It whistled fiercely, and the ropes cracked their whips, and on she flew. The skipper watched with intense anxiety. By the occasional flash of lightning he now beheld breakers. Still the stern refuses to go round. He gives a quick order to Clincher, who, With the men execute it with like rapidity. Tle sails move as it were in a body, only a few inches?n the wind, and at the last monment, the ship was successfully box-hauled. She turned away from the breakers and sped on her new track. Again the wind changed to fair, and the Aldebaran was on the broad Gulf.    C H APTER      XL II I. THE MEXICAN SEA. *I  TTHE novelty and excitement of watching land and reefs was now over. Not a rock-reared, its shark-like jaws in the morning as Major June came cheerily on deck humming -  ' i The sea, the sea, the open sea!"

"Farewell!' said the rosy major, "to the Florida Beefs, and the Bahama Banks, farewell to their cur- rents and squalls, to their wreckers and, green turtle, a long farewell." "Beautiful!" he continued. " let the sea-shell sleep in the clear water below with the geraniuins of thip rocks, or sing to the dolphins that glide above them; I would never again disturb their sunny enjoyment." The wind was light, sometimes falling away entirely, leaving a feverish, panting calm, yet preferable to the -hot July weather on shore. The gulf-breeze at times, chiefly night, comes with a   210          F FACA. soft, liquid breath, filling the lungs as with the balm of flowers growing in cool grottos; or w'thk an occasional puff of sweetness, faint and fresh, as if a lady passed you with her scented fan or delicately perfumed hand- kerchief.

"I'll tell you what the Gulf reminds me of," said Clincher to Old Sol, in a whisper, " and I 've crossed it many a time--squalls, hurricanes, aiid sharks, sir."   CHAPTER XLIV. THE SERGE ANTIS DAUGHTER. I HAVING, with the assistance of Captain Handsh- around, cleverly carried the ship Aldebaran around jhe Florida capes, and seen her fairly at sea again, we may now renew our intercourse with Faca and her friends. Her character may have already perplexed critics of J;he stereotype order;, but, as it is drawn from real life, we gently defy them! We may still more perplex them, for nature ever perplexes the craft of critics. "Till fools condemn and judges praise, The poet hath not earned his bays!" Yet the genuine critic, judging not with plummet and square with the mind's eye, but wisely, through the weak- nesses of his own heart will do Faca justice. Faca Trainor was a little goddess in disguise; but an Amer- ican goddess. Yet her divinity triumphed over the schools -primary, high, and normal-and she was, after all, herself; that is to say, an humble, hearty, high- spirited girl, liking William Marshal, fearing and hat- C .r"t ""    .sILI LIW    L   T THE  SERG EA'N-': S DAUGHTER.  213 ing Mr. Bardolph, and flatteded and amused by queer, bashful Old Sol. And now, behold another lover at her feet! even our simple friend, Swallow. "Miss Faca," said he, standing near her state-roon door, pale and agitated- - "I  I have made a bet about you!."      i "Sir,' said Facacoldly, with a stare.    ' i "Yes, yes, ma'am." Faca smiled. "It seems to trouble you very much, 'Mr. Swallow; what is it?"  "Why, 1 have bet with Neb--Mr. Nebulus I mean, -that I could kiss you."  Poor Swallow nearly fainted, Faca turned pale and cold as a Grecian statue. "Good morning, sir," said the maiden, opening her state-room door. "O do not, do rLot go! please listen, Miss Faca; I mean no offenice." "What! to bet about me?"He took hold. of her dress gently and she remained. "Does Lieutena;n; Soldan'know' of this, sir?" The maiden blushed deeply at this implied relation. "Yes, ma'am." Faca turned suddeQnly pale again. "I 'll tell you hov it happened. Mr. Soldan'was say- ing, in reply to some bantering of ir. Nebulus', that i           .       .'   214          FACA. you were. different from all other soldiers' children. I said I thought so too; but believed I could kiss you, and bet my commission on it." "(Then-resign, Mr. Swallow." ( O, Miss Faca, I see,- I saw just now how' much I had mistaken you. We, young officers, think we car- do anything with the girls in the way of fun. Had I re- flected a moment I should not have staked my commis- sion so lightly. If you will let me, Miss Faca, I will marry you; for if I resign, my father is such a proud, violent man, he would never see my face again." Faca was astonished. Such was the veneration she entertained towards the officers, that they seemed fa- thers to her, all, old and young; but here was one stam- mering,- and pleading, and offering himself, as if for a whipping or martyrdom. And Swallow read prayers too! Old Sol had made no less a fool of himself. Now, Mr. Plummet and Square Critic, what wo:lld you do? Faca bent down her white beautiful face, and Mr. Swallow drew near with his quivering lip; he took her hand and paused diffidently, then exclaimed, as if his soul burst forth upon the breath, "No! I will resign first." ( Tell them!"  cried Faca, rashy. flinging her :cold arms around the youngster's neck, "tell them,   THEE  SERGEANT:S   DAUGHTE'R.    215 that Faca Trainor r-ot only let you kiss her, but kissed you.

See her on her knees weep- ing, and sobbing convulsively, as -though her young strong heart would break. See the face red with shame, burning with indignation, yet self-reproach. She re- flected on her peculiar situation. Rising, she tossed back her wild dark flood of hair and looked in -the mirror. "Yes," said Faca, -"I am beautiful indeed. Detested face! shameful locks! And well educated too, fitted to shine in the conversation of wise, good, learned men. Yet, fixed in caste, as a common soldier's daughter; looked down upon with pity by one; bet upon as a fast nag would be, by another; tolerated while my beauty and virtue last, then to be flung away as a campwoman! O God!"she cried, " protection, pity, aid, aid!" By the handful she would have torn out her dishev- elled hair. She seized her whitc, tear-stained, yet   -EXT  CHAPTER.        217 lovely cheeks with her finger-nails, and was about to disfigure that beautiful face: the hot blood of her mo- ther was boiling id her veins.    V "No!" she exclaimed, "I will not "I will rid my- self of my beauty by other means." The tender heart within her revolted from the picture of a scratched, mangled countenance. Then dressing her hail, plainly and putting on her simplest frock, she wiped away the the traces of tears and went out. The surgeon heard a knock at his door: he was lying down, in his shirt-sleeves, reading. "Come in!" he cried gruffly. The door was gently opened, and timidly, Faca step- ped within. The surgeon jumped up and tossed on his coat.      , "Why, what in the world?" he stammered. "This is an unexpected honOr; you do yourself harm, young wo- man: the story will be that-    . "Stay, sir," she said, firmly compressing her lips, and laying her hand on his arm ,as he moved to open the door, " a soldier's daughter, sir, has no name to lose; and such a peculiar '( story" would do you no discredit, for you are a man; such is the judgment pf society; is it not?"

Any, sir, with the ship-fever, or small-pox? I think I would prefer the small-pox." "What do you mean, girl?   I fear you are de- ranged.' "( No, sir; I have only come to my senses." "( That 's a sure symptom." - Hear me, sir," she cried, stamping her foot, as was her wont, when vexed with unusual impatience. "I am all attention," ,You, gentlemanly officers, think me pretty. Now I would rid myself of this attraction to those above me, since it subjects me to danger." "Danger? "I have said enough: I would nurse your patients, if possible catch the small-pox, lose my beauty, and go forth a plain, unnoticed soldier's daughter and marry a soldier ' or better, die!"         - Faca burst into tears.  The kind-hearted surgeon said nothing, but taking her arm within his own, he led her to her state-room door and left her. ,  r   ICHAPTER     XLVI . T H E CONSPIRACY. IT was on the night of the third of July. In the band-room of the Aldebaran were come together a com- pany of dark, sinister-looking men. i In the middle of the little assembly sat Mr. Bardolph, upon a camp-stool. Those around him were members of the band, who, as we have already informed the reader, were mostly political refugees, a few non-com- missioned officers, the chief of whom  was Sergeant Bootlick, and soldiers, artilleriests, and dragoons, one of the ex-lawyers, and an ex-doctor, dressed in the infantry uniform. These people were sitting upon the sides of the bunks with th2ir feet dangling down. Some were whispering stealthi y together, casting furtive glances at the drum- major, and others, with their heads upon their bosoms, sat in moody, expectant silence.  Mr. Bardolph's arms were folded, and his brows, usu- ally so smooth and placid, were now wrinkled with the harrow of deep thoughts.  The door opened and Corporal Marshall entered. low murmur of siglifican t applause ran round the room,   220          A CA. as the drum-major arose and welcomed the bold, dash- ing, out-and-out young soldier. "Before I become one of this respectable body," said, Marshal, "I demand at once your object and your plans, gentlemen." The drum-major seized him impatiently by the hand, and drew him dowrl to a seat near himself ("That is right, you are wise in that. but be patient, you shall soon know all." The door again opened after a slight knock, and in walked a Catholic priest. "Welcome, Holy Father!" cried Bardolph, "you look yourself in your robes." , The others arose, except Marshal, and bowed their heads in silence, then threw themselves again upon the bunks. Mr. Bardolph gave the priest his ow n seat, and going to the door, now locked and stood near it. "This is not the first time I have sat upon a camp stool, recruit as I am; nor the first time I have worn a -bue jacket," said the priest taking the seat and throw- ing back his, cassock for the heat, disclosing underneath a soldier's round jacket. He was a short, burly man, with an immense head-piece, and well chiselled features, though low forehead, beneath which were deeply set a pair of black eyes. His language was pure English, with a slight foreign accent, not at once detected.   T HE C ON ' SPIR ACY.      221 "The bandmaster is gone!" he said in a kind voice. ' Poor young ran, he was amiable"     ; ( But impracticable, Holy Father, you will say masses for his soul: here is money," said Bardolph meekly. The priest refused the price of purgatory,- with a slight sneer, icurling his lip. "I will pray for him, my son - and for you." "Why for me, Holy Father?" asked Mr. Bardolph, crimsoning. "That you may have a more agreeable bed-fellow, i  and    ! The drum-major looked at the priest, and then sig- nificantly threw his eyes on Corporal Marshal. The priest seemed to understand, for he hesitated, and concluded suddenly- "And oie, my son, whom you shall not be so willing to have sleep upon deck--and be lost, he added, in an under tone. "Gentlemen," said Mr. Bardolph addressing all pre- sent, " please draw close around me that I may speak low." They obeyed him, and he went on - "Before disclosing my plans it is no more than reasonable that all of us should be sworn to secrecy." "Oh no, Certainly not," was murmured.- The priest held up a crucifix, before which, most of those arounid him crossed themselves. 19": ' I     !    222          FACA. The priest held up a crucifix, before which most of those around him crossed themselves. ' In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, amen," muttered the priest; "in the name of the Mother of God, the Imlmaculate and Divine Conception, the birth of Christ our Lord, an I the descent of the Holy Ghost, the day of final judgment, purgatory and everlasting hell, amen. You all swear, my children, in the name-.of these terrific persons, and thngs to come, 'to preserve within your own bosoms, inviolate, -the dread, holy, and patriotic secrets of this conclave. Amen!" "Amen!" responded forth low, and     from  deep voices. . "' Or everlasting damnation be your several shares. Amen '  "Amen!" again issued forth from the depths. The priest sat down. "-And you, Father?" said Mr. Bardolp:i. "I take the same oath," was the priest's reply, kiss- ing the crucifix. Swear it again, one and all!" was heard from the passage without, in a hollow voice. "Swear it again!" 'The drum-major opened the door, and the ghastly figure of George stood before them. "Swear it again," cried the ghost, "i and in my pre- ' senco ! '     -   THE  CONSP IRACY.'       223 Even the lpriest trembled. And with an unsteady voice he went through the formulary again, and pressed the crucifix to the lips of all present, except Corporal Marshall, who turned away his face!saying, "I have sworni, it is enough, I am a Protestant. The door fell to, as if by its own accord, and those pale men satl by themselves, with their consciences. "Gentlemen," said Mr. Bardolph, "the appalling sight we have just witnessed proclaims heaven's favor e upon our schemes. That ghost haunts this ship, silently calling dow vengeance upon its officers." "Ghost or not," said the corporal in-a firm voice, "I have taken sufficient part ii this useless mummery;' once more I demand your plans." "Ay, the plans!" echoed- many of the others. "The first object, which we may after a while discuss in detail," said Bardolph lowering his voice more th n he had yet one, " is to despatch the offcers and those few of the soldiers and sailors who refuse to join us. "The next thing, presenting the grand motive and tempting regward, wealth and honor, may be chosen-from three opportunities now .presented to us, like ripe fruit, . waiting only to be plucked. "With the four hundred men we can confidently count up:on;.our serviceswarould be gladly accepted by the Rio Grande revolutionists, by thde Nicaragua expedition, a member of lvhich iA our firiend here," he laid his hlnd !     * -        I "."   '24          FAOA. upon the ex-lawyer's shoulders, "or still more eagerly and with richer and surer hope of reward, by the Cuban insurrectionists." There was a buzz of deep satisfaction. Eyes viewed the masterly drum-major with astonished admiration. But up rose the young soldier, Marshal, and stalked to the door., "I must leave!" "No you can't, it is too late,' replied Mr. Bardolph, "I will leave," said Marshal between hisi set teeth. A dagger gleamed from    the folds of the priest. Making a gesture of forbearance towards the latter, Mr. Bardolph whispered in the ear of the s ldier- "Your revenge, boy, and wealth and honor! your oath too, remember!  Besides, you are in our power, a little cold steel, a body overboard, it sinks, and no one knows; dead men tell--- " Marshal started back, "I will alarm the guard," he cried. "What, ho!  i Bardolph's hand was on his mouth and shut off fur- ther sound.  The conspirators sprang like tigers upon him. One felled him to the floor, and above his breast glittered the bright dagger of the priest. "No!:" said Mr. Bardolph authoritivelr. "'Twill never do, unless,"--and he glared fiercely upon the prostrate vouth, " unless he divulges  A -"   THE   C O',NSPR PI R ACY Y.  225 "Jesu Md ria!" ejaculated the-priest, "if he does, there is no land distant enough for him to escape the holy arm of the Society of Jesus."  "No sea deep enough to bjiry hipaself," added the drum-major harshy. "Lethim rise." Corporal Iarshal stood upon his feet. ' I remen-ber my oath," said the young man with hoarse emotion. "In a moment of madness, sirs, I lis- tened to the temptations of your leader, little consider-  ing the blood and infamy. 3row, not to gratify any l private maliee under heaven, would I tak6 life! And never! never!" he added emphatically through white lips, "will - perjure myself by breaking allegiance to the flak of my country.   '  Thelt looking coldly around the crowd he said, "My life is in your hands, take it." No one stirred; it was Bardolph that awed them. "But," continued Marshal, after the pause, " you may trust my honor with your secret thus far, for I do not fear your plains. I know the character of those aga inst whom you plot, too well. Their revolvers will strike some o you? down, and intimidatp the irest, I might ad- vise  ,r "Enough,; take care of yourself, not us," said Bar- dolph.

Bardolph exclaimed, in a low, thick voice, terrible to hear, and glancing terrible eyes around the room.. "Go on," he said to the corporal. "No' more. If you can trust me, let ma go. Up to this moment all is Iocked in my breast. After this, whatever I hear or see shall be revealed." "Go then," said Bardolph, opening the door tin the face of the frowns: and; gnashing teeth of the conspi- rators. And the true young American soldier was gone. l Theq room rang now with reproaches, which the drum- major received coldly and calmly, until their force was spent, then he spoke with a gentle voice. "Gentlemen, I know better than any other the game I play. But if you cannot trust me we will stay this business. ' But why  ?" began one to say. "I will explain, partly. That youth's life is to me important, to divert the attention of the officers from our proceedings among the soldiers. He is in love with the Trainor girl, and so seem all the officers too. In their love-toils I will catch them napping, and this youngster shall be the instrument. Do yoqi see nov?" "I Perfectly!" said the priest smiling down his own frowns. M" "ethinks, my son, I see your hand.

"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed all feebly. ( Ha!. ha! ha " laughed the drum-major feebly. "Now -to business," he quickly said. "I Lad not time to tell you just now, gentlemen, that the'Cuban junta is represented in the person of this Holy Father, unonv honoring and blessing us with his i sacred oresence and heavenly benediction." *  "Thou hast well spoken, my son."   Then address- ing the others, the priest developed his own plans, and explained his purposes, nay motives. I have a double interest in securing your co-opera- tion wi;h the'friends of liberty in Cuba," said he. "I am a Cuban by birth, and sigh for liberty, and what is to me still more important, our holy church at the pre- sent time has a quarrel against Spain, and as her true and devoted son, I am bound to do the enemy of Rome all the evil possible, and so do God himself a service. I Amen." "Amen!" piously breathed out the conspirators. The drum-major then delivered himself of an oration, 'warmly setting forth the wrongs of his native and, and Iportraving in glowing colors the chief advantages to be gained in that quarter. He described her rich, churches, her temptingg ,omen, her wealthy plantations her -millions of slaves. In once flight of his eloquence I            .   -3        i  FACA. he soared above mercenary motives, through his genuine love of freedom, his hatred of tyranny, his appeal for his island brethren. Less eloquence would have convinced such men. They inclined unanimously towards the Cuban attrac- tion; they longed to revel in the palaces of the Ha- vana; they swore each one should have for his own prize a plantation, stocked with a thousand slaves. The thing, too, was practicable, for the priest told them, there were now two or more fleet vessels hoverinog in the Gulf, to carry the news of any approaching forces to the insurrectionists, who could gather at a point to be fixed, in sufficient numbers to make a successful move, if armed, and the Aldebaran was loaded with arms for the frontiers of Texas and New Mexico; and so it was decided in favor of Cuba. The details of the movement on ship-board were next arranged  by the masterly drum-major. The embryo state was organized. Mr. Bardolph, the head chieftain. His staff was named: the ex-lawyer, Temple, should be minister of state, and the ex-doctor, Toombs, surgeon- general. The shrill reveille broke them  to pieces, and they appeared  on deck like pale spectres of the dawn. The  following night was resolved upon for another meeting. \   CHAPTER     XLVII.

"Th'ree cheers for the Aldebaran and her commander, boys, -Captain Handsallaround!" cried honest old Jack, the boatswain; and loud and long were the sailors and soldiers shouting for their officers. "Fools!" said itr. Bardolph to the priest, standing near in a soldier's uniform, " fools! they will burst their own throats to-day, and cut the officers' throats to- morrow."         ' "Ay," said the priest; " the can be bought and sold like any other cattle"  So wise men, such as Mr. Bardolph, and holy men, like the priest, have thought from the beginning of time. Had not the Roman senator his price? "Three cheers for starvation, comrades!" cried a ong, rope-necked man, with an insatiably greedy ook.       , The priest laughed: the conspirators looked at each ther significantly; but Mr. Bardolph frowned, yet a atisfied frown" was that, and no soul responded to the ash sentiment. ' Then the band poured forth a stream of harmony, ividing into various national airs, all concentrating gain, and leaping 'down the music-fall of Yankee oodle.     !     , The military officers were not on deck, and the sol-   rFOURTH   OF JUL Y 21 Ot N.

"Comrade!" cried the other, "there's a good time coming." The future minister of state took his companion one side, and filled his heart with "Treasons, stratagems, and spoils." The conspirators distilled their poison well that day, and the conspiracy was gradually gathering to a head. --A motley command was Major June's. The number of disciplined soldiers was small, and the number of raw recruits, gathered in from the four corners of the earth, was large. With some, the love of adventure, or mystery, prevailed; in many, rascality in all its forms, predominated.  Sloth, misfortune, ignor- ance, bankruptcy, and the wine-cup are your recruiting- officers. But at that time, when the soldier's pay was a pittance, no better men: could be enlisted.

FOURTH  OF JULY OVER THE FORE-TqP. TIE -Aldebaran was in gala trim;' spare sails and other canvass were stretched overhead from stem to stern, and from larboard to starboard, forming an awn- ing under which sped about the sea air, blowing lightly and freshy into everybody's face. Along the edges of. the awning were draped in grace- ful festoons and triumphal -arches the folds of many a fair banner. Upon and about the masts muskets were stacked, and artillery cutlasses and cavalry sabres ar- ranged in starry groups, keen and radiant vith blood- thirsty brightness, as the dog-star of the heavens, yet peaceful and united as our own glorious constellation of 'States. On the quarter-deck a panoply formed of star-span- gled banners hung over a large dais, on the baclr part of which was a sort of double throne. Here sat our gallant friend, Major June, in the full uniform of his order; rosy with beaming light was his face. On his left side, decked fairly as the goddess of liberty, sat a  pale, beautiful young woman, with the severely i     '    FOURTH   OF  JULY.       235 classic features of a Grecian statue, softened in their expression to loveliest oval, and form motionless as parble.

Near him were the sur- weon, Swallow, Nebulfs, and the other young officers, 'all wearing, like their honored chief, the full martial 1insignia. Opposite sat ICaptain Handsallaround, Clincher, Junks, and Harry Joints, the ship's carpenter,-all looking a little uneasy at the novelty of their situation, display forming no part of Jack's character.  Veracious Clincher especially, rolled his great quid about his twisted mouth, and scanned every part of the ship visible to his wide open eyes, restlessly. At one end ,f this semi-circle on the quarter-deck was our little Ethiopian, Snowhall, dressed as a smart sailor, and at fthe other end, a drummer-boy, both standing' with un- easy crossed legs, and eacl holding up the depending folds of a flag. Excepting the watch and  the guard, aill the sailors \\    ** 'j *  ,    \   233;          FACA. and soldiers were visible on deck, ranged each in his rank and order, forming handsome arrays, -a gallant sight to behold. And :there too, were seen the camp- women and their children. While the dramatis persons in this scene were taking their allotted places, the usual ship sounds were dying away till all was still. *' At last a soft and solemn breathing sound Rose like a steam of rich distilled perfumes, Aid stole upon the air, that even Silence Was took ere she was 'ware, and wished she might Deny her nature and be never more, Still to be so displaced." Even the band, jaded as they were with night-work, and little sympathising as they could with the spirit of the day, were inspired, for "E'en rage itself is cheered with music; It wakes a glad remembrance of our youth, Calls back past joys, and warms us into transport." Then the services of our national Sunday began aboard the good ship Aldebaran.   The day was fine, winds beat their own beldames' tame, and their wild roars were turned to gentle ech6es; the sea was calm, and scarce a cloud bigger than a man's hand obscured the blue-domed crystal palace of the sun.   i         FOURTH- OF      JULY.       237 ;',        THE ODE.

Was there now no man of God, to offer up a prayer? A  momlent's penitence stirred the dead leaves of yon withered  fig tree there the back-slidden Parson.  A gleam of malignant satanity shot forth from the piercing eyes of yon plotting Priest.  There was no man of God to invoke a blessing. Then   arose the tall figure of Lieutenant Soldan. Coming to one corner of the dais, he laid upon a desk covered with bunting, a  roll of paper, which he olened, and from which he addressed the multitude. OLD SOL'S FOURTH OF JULY ORATION  ON GLORY. "COMADES!-- - In the garden of the castle of Fur- stenberg,' says a  writer, ' there is a singularly beattiful little spring; it bubbles up amidst flowers and grass, and overruns the green sward in many a   limpid streamn- let.

' Could that writer, my. comrades, have stood at the wekl of our national glory, and watched with the eye of a seer, the little stream widening as it went, till now it washes the banks of thirty odd states, each one a sove- reign, ard all an empire where freedom reigns, he would find a spectacle more' teeming with interest to the poet, Ia'nter, merchant and politician,' than all the' mighty rivars' of- the world. i ' The name and head of every American reflects a portion cf this glory; but, comrades; it is peculiarly our boast, that we have set apart our lives to cherish, honor, Lani defend it against all enemies. - Abandoning the jcomforts of home, and the pursuits of wealth, we devote ourselves to this one noble object.

Withdrawn from  the temptations of polluting traffic, he should cherish none  but generous emotions;- the time has passed away for mercenary soldiers. Where once there lay but one road to -distinction, there now diverge a thousand well- trod paths to fame; but one road to Glory remains, and that is- the profession of arms, by land or sea., "There is no room here for selfishness, for schem- ing, for any sort of double-dealing.

"Great is the soldier's office and reward. When he returns from war, the country rings with his applause; and when, with his brave heart and nobly-cultivated in- ,stincts, he seeks repose in the bosom of his family, what sweet repose'! what loving eyes the woman of his heart turns upon him!

"What!" whispered the priest to Bardolph, "' Is it possible that he has a clue?"*  "If that young, Marshal has betrayed us, he, at least; e shall fall, if I lose my neck," replied the drum major.

Cheer upon cheer made the welkin ring again, as the orator wound up his trumpet-blast with this flourish of true patriotism. A proud warm glow mantled his dark features as he resumed his seat. Thick and panting went the breath of the Goddess of Liberty, now no longer pale and statuesque ; but with brightened color coming and going on her beautiful cheek, she had gazed with burning admiration, and listened with heightening pleasure. The kindled glance with which she simply and invo- luniarily rewarded the lieutenant as he took his seat, sent the young blood reeling to his old heart, like a drunken Cupid to the lap of Venus. If the soldiers all could not understand the orator of the day, Faca, the soldier's daughter, could. Bowing to:tle major, who stood ready to escort her away, she went' like a child to the side of Old Sol, and at this moment the "celebration" broke up.   CHAPTER XL IX. WOMAN.

FoR the brief while Paca abandoned herself to the pleasures of listening to-the oration of the day, forget- ful of the bitter trial going  forward in her heart's depths.  ' At the ur ent request of the officers, and the corn-, mands of her father -her mother would not persuade, for or againsti -she had consented to take the part we have described in the proceedings. "I will be a mere automaton," she said to herself. But the noble words she heard awoke in her soul all the slumbering poetry and passion of her highly st ung nature, and she flung herself wildly to tae control of those lofty emotions. Both the cool, revengeful Bardolph, and the impetu- ous, generous Marshal, saw the change as it portrayed it-   FACAeS   ADMRERS.        247 self upon her expressive face. But with what different feeling they saw! "S' death!" exclaimed the drum-major to himself, "The girl is completely carried away with'these fine words. 'Woman, like moths, are ever caught- by glare. I 'll tame her down to the realities of life, an' I get her!" "INo wonder, no wonder," said Marshal shaking his head mournfully, " that she looks above me, it is her destiny to Soar; she revels now in her own atmosphere." Then the corporal scanned the appearance of Old Sol, his gaunt figure, his advancing years; these not even the klow of eloquence could hide. If I were an officer I could make Faca happier than he," thought William  "a chance to develope my faculties under more genial associations, than those of a soldier in ranks, a command of 'books, and the usages of polite society. By heavens!" he ejaculated abruptly,. as his several deficiencies presented themselves ---'By heavens, 'it would be throwing herself away to take Cor- poral William Marshal! Man you 're mad!" But it was only in a moment like the present that the gallant corporal, superior as he was to his fellows, could make, due allowance foe Faca. He felt harsh and bitter ; he blamed her for so mich as even listening to the advances of the lieutenant; he even dared, in his jaun- diced imagination; to see a darl k mleaning in Old Sol's 4'      8    248           1 FACA. pretensions tQ his mistress's hand -he doubted whether it was her ha id he wanted.

TH'E BUSY. NOE OF PREPARATION. IT was near the middle watch- the Aldebaran went plowing a good furrow through the rippling sea. With a steady, favorable wind, few alterations were required in the sails, and most of the crew were -:asleep. Those on the look out were away ahead, nea the bowsprit, and with the exception of the, solitary:steersman, the other sailors lay coiled about the wheel near the tan- rail.            .  :Lulled by the soft sea-breeze, the drowsy sentry shuf- fled sleepily to and fro on his lonely round, occupyirg the middle of the upper deck, about the mainmast. Little was he or the corporal of the guard disturbed that night by the men coming up, on one pretence or another, for a breath of fresh air. They slept well after the pageantry of the day, and an unusually liberal fa1 lowance of the commissary fare - topt by a desert of rice and molasses. Not asleep was Faca. Quite motionless she lay, fear- ful of disturbing Constaniza, her poor little brain busy with I        ,   NOTE   O-P PREPARATION. I     257 her troubles. Little did her lover know how sorely her heart was tried - sorely, sorely. She found herselfi face to face with troubles such as she little apprehended when, a bit of a girl, she last parted from her parents and military people: or even lately, when she so gladly rejoined them. She was beset by dangers on every hand. Her present position was bad enough, but her pre- sent position she must change--possibly for a worse. She must enter into one or other of two new worlds. But single or married--much as she had formerly loved it, she now looked with loathing upon life in the ranks. To exchange it for one in the class above her, to subject herself possibly to the sneers of proud women, to find herself in one rank  in life, and hdr parents in another, was equally abhorent.  Yet   a  y h er taste, and there her heart.  Many find thems lves placed so. Faca was not of a calculating spirit; but the forecast of such a mind as hers is a sort of divine instinct - given for self-protection. Women overleap logic at a bound, as Alvarado overleaped the charm in the causeway. Fada knew where her peril arose.   , "Oh!" she inwardly exclaimed, "could I but rid myself of my  beauty!'-these fatal charms!"  Below in the baid room  the conspirators were met. There was the tall and polished drum-major, and the wily priest", Temple' and 'the otlers, - among them sat the ghost. .fGeorge appeared qlag. ,art; alnd wore suchl a 22o9);   258          FACA. dogged look as despera ite men wear when hope has long been a stranger. "St. Paul admonishes," said the priest, "' to' take a little wine for our stomnach's sake and our often infir- mities.' Knowest thou, son Bar'dolph, whether there be ally within reach?" "Yes, Holy Father, we wait only for the guard to change.' "By St. Lazarus! my son, I hope the guard will change soon. My dry throat has been doing penar ce for its many sins these twenty days. The diplomatic Temple looked at the priest with eyes that said: "There ,may be other things to tickle thy Htoly Father's throat.'  In short the futurei secretary of state was an Amer- ican, and taking practical views of things, undertook to persuade his confederates against "liquoring," as he called it, just on the-eve of their attempt. It was in vain. A carousal was decided on, since liquor was known to lie in the hospital steward's room, cases of pure medicinal cognac. It would seem as if! God often filled the wicked with desires, which tend tol defeat them in their wickedness. The event calculated i to restore the priest's throat to a state of peace with his conscience soon happened. The tramp of the guard Was heard, and a half-hour after- wards the priest and the two Bardolph's stole up the I   NOTE  OF ?l?A Il A ATION.   2 59 , [ steps -- known as the " womens' stairw4ay," for it was here the women made their ascent to the deck-and all at length found themlselves in the starboard lobby, or pas- sane leading between the quarter-deck and bulwarks. At the forward extremity of this passage Mr. Bardolph stationed himself whispering to his mates. "The guard are mostly asleep." "The corporal is wide awake." "The sentinel is down towards the galley." "Now he comes this way--draw ; draw tack!" The slight noisel and whisperings made by this noc- turnal band near her window excited "Facas attention, as she lay in her berth tossing with her emotions, She listened the more attentively from her nervous condition, and on account of the personal fear that she, had already, alas! experienced.    , "What- now?"She cried shuddering to herself. "I know not what to! expect. I will awake grandmother." But grandmother slept so soundly it 'were a great pity to disturb her - and she could not go to sleep again,' old as she was. "No!" thought she, ( 't will do no good either, and ftis bad enough to have one poor unprotected female conscious of her darger. Sleep on, dear grandmother.!" Half terrified, yet with keen, listening, curious ear, Faca lay; in the upper berth of the state-room. The window was opinl, but. a small venetian blind shuttor   260          FACOA. protected the beautiful from all eyes, save God's and the holy angels. It was arranged that George the ghost should Tft along"in the shadow of the bulwarks and rigging on ore side, while the sentry and corporal were on the other; go around the galley while the sentry was on the stern end of his-post, and steal into the steward's room.  They whispered so low that Faca could not distinguish whose voices they were; she could in fact only hear a word now and then - but one of them was-" corporal," and disguise it from herself as she might, Faca felt great interest in a certain corporal. And so, with her feminine instinct, she suspected that Bardolph, her cor- poral's foe, composed one of that skulking band of mid- night whisperers under her window. Now her fear took a new form -for him. ' And, such is the privacy of love, how glad was she that her grand- mother had not been awakened! But not a sentence could she hear; with all her sharp listening, and timid, loving, delicate instincts aroused. Soon the sounds ceased entirely. In a few moments- it seemed longer to Faca-- there was the least possible noise of footsteps, and then the same voices louder, elate with some achvement i "How many, my son?"That was not the drum major's voice. "Nine," said anothei- unknown.   NOTE    OFr PREPATATION.      261 Jesu! that's good!" whisperqd the first. "The sentinel saw me as I rounded to, but I fetched. up all standing, and: then bore down on him a fathom or so, till he shngged -up under the corporal's wing, - e! he! "There!" sa'd Faca to herself.   ",The 'corporal' again." Hark! it was Bardolph's voice now; she knew it in- stantly. "Did the steward stir?"         . ," No," was the reply. "I opened the door softly; I stood at it, with Ahe moon shining on my face bloody as ever, and chains on my hands too; it almost scared me to look at myself." '  "But the bott-es!" said an impatient voice. ,' Nine you say, my soor, are you sure they contain the--? ' i"Yes, the box was not nailed down. Here, Holy Father, smell of that."      I  Faca heard a h arty snuff and then a gurgling sound, terminated by a satisfactory "Ugh! 'tis good, by Saint Lazarus!" * ' "Pass it around, my hearties, before we go below," said the same .voice that had mentioned "the corporal."  Faca knew it wel enough from that. "Verily the laborer is worthy of his hire, my son, and we may not muzzle the ox treading out the corn. A bottle or two will not be missed below by the brethren.

Three are none OQ few." The whispering again became too indistinct for Faca's ,ars. : She could only hear a word or two at intervals. "The poison -, arms below - corporal - officers- guard-- he -they--- we- " were all she could dis- inguish; but they were terrible. She thought of seek- ng out corporal Marshal, but knew not where among o many men to find him: and to communicate her fears so others--possibly they wera fancies of her over- vrought brain - might e pose her to calumny or ridicule. Then she would wake Lieutenant Soldan, but she shrank back from this with tremu ous modesty. "The major --" o10, she would go down to her father. The noises had died away long before she resolved on ler course. The whisperers were gone. Without; dis- :urbing Consta nza she arose, drew on/her morning robe, threw a shawl overher head and; shoulders, and went lown to the married peoples' apartments. But as she ;ained the door of her father's room, her eye was attracted by a light -under the door of a neighboring room. This was an irregular thing. Faca knew that it was the band room, and that they had no authority for having a light at this time. "Bardolph's room," she whispered to herself, "they   - NOT  OF  ePRBPA  BATION    263 must be in there. If I wake father it will only alarm them. I will listen."- W ith a blush, but with kitten-like gentleness and hesitating cautioc, she crept to the door. She heard many things; we will not say what, but Faca was chained to that post by the omnipotent in- terest at her heart. It was not the corporal,her old playmate and present lover, not him alone, in danger, but Lieutenant Soldan, and all the ship, she thought, the officers at least , and she heard her father mentioned as among the doomed. And yes! O God. yes, among ribald jests her 'own name !"Faca! Faca!" with toasts to her, and hip-hip-hurrahs! And that dreadful man, Bardolph! he pronounces her name, there, in that Iden of midigli revelers and thieves, and murderers perhaps. Bardolph has not said many words but now he waxes, warm with wine.

Speak low to-night! commune with me in numbers, As angels' soft and sweetly tongued, * My earthly part within me child-like slumbers, Tired of the sports that to the day belonged. - A song!

Slaves! bring me wine! blood-red, that beats the brain To foaming madness in its joy!

Like lightning Bardolph sprang out, and caught her convulsed form.  Petrified with horror, her very tongue seemed a lap-stone, and refused to shriek. With one wild look she closed her eyes, and sank lifeless in the arms of her terrible enemy. "Mates," said Bardolph with a voice cold, clear, and calm, " we must go on with the,work, we have not time for poison now. Cold steel must do the business. Leave this woman to me. Not a moment to be lost."  He had drawn her into the room, and the conspirators stood dumb around-  ;"Holy Father! --George! ---you two, at least, know the opportunity will slip as soon as this womna n wakes, or is even missed. Away!"   NOTE  OF  PREPARATION.      265 "Ay!   muttered George, "'t is always so; he's never where the blow is to be struck!"  "Pooh! pooh man!" said( Bardolph mastering his passion ly a powerful effort.!"I will- join you in a mo. ment. Away!" "Come'! quick! away!" echoed Temple. Now or never"            -  And Bardolph was alone with his beautiful, helpless victim. 23 ;,  A      :IC HA        T E   I 1 THE SHELL BURSTS. THs way, quick! rpidly, but no noise," said the priest to the ex-doctor. The two separated themselves from their confederates. The latter led by Temple flew into the main-dccl; quar- ters where the taroops -were lodged, then separately went to the bunks of those whose minds they had severally prepared for the event, or rather some event, that was to make them all rich and powerful. "To the gun-room! to the gun-room!' whispered each daring conspirator, gently but effectually aWaken- ing his mnan. And the first noise hehard aboard the ship by the guard and watch, was from the, forcing open of musket boxes. In a moment all was noise and con- fusion. "Guard ho! up men!   cried the corporal of the uard, and With them at his heels, he went tearing down the stairway, forcing his passage by blows and thrusts, through-the bewildered soldiery, seVeral of whom aimOd ineffectual blows at his head after he had passed; and by the time the gun room was reached he was'entirely   T II  I LL   U  S T S.    267-- detached from his party, who were more easily thrust aside, scattered and stricken down in the melee. Not an instant did the corporal pause. He held in his hand nothing but a bayonet, the arm of the whole guard'. Springing to an open box of muskets he seized one,and jumping upon the box, whirled the musket around his head with such velocity as to render any approach to himself or the box impossible. The next moment Clincher, whose watch it was, stood in the gun-room, grasping a musket. The two brave men now boldly advanced against a Iparty of the conspirators who had equipped themselves with arms-- fortunately there was no ammunition within reach, that being stowed away on the orlop deck below. While the corporal engaged one of the foremost, another flew by him with a growl like that of an en- ragtd lion. It was George. "BRemember the byass knuckles!' he roared, and clasping and raising Wlis two hands armed with the iron fetters --for they were loosed from only one wrist- he dealt his old enemy such a blow on the forehead as felled Clincher to the" deck, completely bereft of sense. Passing over his prostrate body and administering to it a brutalt kick, George sprang thirough the crowd, gained the gun-room door, then the hatchway, and jumped down upon the orlop decelk. Divining the intentions of the mutineer, the Corporal J .pr   268          PACA. was about to rush after him, when several of the con- spirators pressed him to the wall, and forced Lhim to be content with self defence. This he was fully equal to,. as he had learnt the practice of musket and bayonet to perfection, while his adversaries were all unskilled. Yet they pressed him sorely --- the breath of his body was nearly exhausted. He retreated sideways towards the door. "Look out for the stairways! keep the officers from coming down! ' cried George from below. A rush was accordingly made for the stirways, by those outside the gun-room, while those withia were now dashing at the corporal, now prying open misket-boxes, and passing out the arms to their confederates. "Men," cried the corporal of the guard, " will you see me killed? will you allow the ship to be taken by these pirates?'; But the well inclined were bewildered and powerless, they were like children, and without a leader A shot was heard and a man fell. It came from the direction of the forward stairway, and hewing a path with his sabre through the thick masses, Old ol appear- ed hastening towards the gun-room. The next instant he stood by that brave corporal. "Leave me, sir," said the latter, "there is a man below after the ammunition, if he- finds it all is lost! I 'll keep them in here.   THE  SHELL  BURSTS.      269 ( Cheery, my hearties!" sang out George, I'm a coming on to it now. But don 't wait, bullies; push up and secure the spar-deck and cabin." "Take this pistol, my man," said Old Sol. "No sir,", replied the corporal coolly, "I can defend myself; shots are scarce." Old Sol vainly endeavored to press the pistol into the brave fellow's hand, then fought his way with his sabre to the hatch i opening down to the orlop deck. "Steady there!" cried the voice of George. "Come down another step and I'll blow up the ship."  He stood with a lighted torch in the midst of powder kegs, one of which'was open. He had not yet passed any up - thank God for that! "Jupiter and Diana! Thunder and lightning! Ju- lius Caesar! Christopher Columbus! I'll be among ye!" exclaimed a clear ringing voice in rifle cracks, and down burst the major, sabre and revolver in either hand; and soon Swallow and Nebulus and Junks were there. The two young officers together with old Ser- geant Trai or, began forming the men, obedient to the major's ordlrs. Junks, armred only with the brass knuckles, wts striking soldiers down right and left in- discriminatey. He gained the gun-i oom  door, and beholding C incher's lifeless formn the noble tar burst into loud laimentations. "By this time the corporal was forced outsile the door.  I " 2 3  1   270j         F . ACA. ' "Charge Bayonets!" ordered Tenjiple, and forth the small, compect, determined body of conspirators rushed, and the corporal and Junks were driven before them at the point of the bayonet like chaff before the wind. "I Halt!" thundered the major. Involuntarily the mutineers haltedl "On I on!" shouted George from below, precluded by Old Sol (who watched him tiger-like, and s:ood guard over the -hatch) from serving out ammunition, but sul- lenly reserving himself the honor of blowing up the ship, should his party be defeated. Those of the soldiers who had received the muskets outside, were already disarmed with little trouble by the activity of Swallow and Nebulus.  The former's sabre strokes are remembered to this day, while the cool cut- and-thrust of the dandy inspired wholesome terror. "I'll perforate you, my fine fellow," said he to a dra- goon mutineer who ventured to withstand him. Nebulus gave him a lunge in tierce, and down dropt the dragoon's sabre on the floor, as .his sword-arm swung lifeless to and fro. "Don't fire," cried the Major often, whiJe the work of disarming was going forward. "Don't kill a  man! I want the ring-leaders." Buit as we have said, the chief" conspirators had ad. vanced from the gun room, and stood now, only an instant however, paralized by the instinct of obedience.   T IE  sIIEL E  UR ST S.     271 Again they Spring forward. [They stand within a few feet of the stairway. Here Major June planted himself with a terrible six-shot revolveir in his hand. ( Now or'hever!" cried Temple.  The MZajor fired, and the attorney's soul went to the court of last appeal. Swallow sprang to the Majr's side, and leveled his pistol at the mutineers. ( Don't fire!" ordered the old officer, in his clear and steady voice. "There's too much blood shed already. My men, yoni have been ledl astray by yonder villain and others - lay down your arms." They grasped them the ihore fiercely. The Priest stood at the head of the ladder beckoning. Seeing him, they supposed the upper deck theirs, and advanced, cheered on pY the shouts of qeorge  . "On, brave bullies, on!  The voice was sepulchral aid thick with baffled spite. Many shudiered as they heard it. At this noment a piercing scream went through the ship, startl'ng all the beligerents, and causing another pause. Then one caught the eye of the Priest above. The man  ung .away his niusket with a terrible oath, ejaculatin something aboutt' treachery and leaders." And up stepped lM. Bardolphll, as bland, though slight- ly pale, as a May morning. *  f  * I v   72         FACA. "Can I help you sir?" said the arch hypocrite, touch- g his hat to the Major. At this the whole party of conspirators Surrendered, ith sullen reproaches and low growls of i vengeance. ley were straightway put in irons and taken to the )per deck, while the drum and fife were sounding forth e long roll.             l And a drum head court martial was ordered forth- th in the cabin.      ,     i       t    CHAPTER     LI II.      - THE'SMOKE CLEARS AWAY. THE mutiny had been disconcerted by' the: accident of Faca's fall against the door.  . It was necessary to act at once, and the programme of proceedir-gs was changed. Thus Providence, by an- other teak instrument, had derange  the schemes: of the wicked. The design 'of the conspirators was -o poison all the officers---this was the Jesuit's proposition. The ex- Doctor, who had first discovered the cognac, reported that ir his search after brandy among the medical stores, he took up a bottle labeled "poison," and the Priest seized upon the idea. Leaying the others, as we mentioned in the last chap- ter, the Priest arid his companion proceeded cautiously to the teward's room. But the steward was now awake. He thought he had been visited by a fearful vision of George the Ghost, and now lay in a cold sweat of agony doubting his senses. The midnigh' ,visit of two other faces confirmed him in the opinion that he was still in  a dreamy state. The Pricstf muffled his face and stood over the quiver- I           274           F A C A. ing steward with a drawn dagger, while Toombs rum- maged the box and found the poison. Te couple the withdrew. "Wlhat are we to do with it now?   whispered Toombs. "Destroy ourselves and die like Christians, my son," replied the Priest, "( if the others fail." The two were yet hesitatinig upon dec2, when the guard rushed below. Had they the nerve, they might have placed themselves at the companion way, and, at least awhile, delayed the guard-and the officers from descending to the gun room. But neither Priest nor physician belongs to the fighting order --- their business lies with the tortuous windings of life's secret ways. I Finding the deck' deserted to themselves and the crew, they went about in whispers tampering with the sailors. And-while the ex-Doctor portrayed the wrongs of seamen, and the dreadful tyranny of captains and mates, as exemplified in the case of George, the Priest held up to their visions pictures of power, and lives of sensuality in Cuba, not stinting his promises of gold, glory, and heaven. Their efforts were lost upon the crew. They stood true to their colors, under the lead of old Jack and Harry Joints -- and perhaps intimidated at -Jle resolute bearing of the skipper on watch. Meantime the arms passed out from the gun room,   T Ei: S:aOKSE CLEiARS    AWAY.    275 had been, seized by Eebulus and Swallow. Two mus- ,ikets were forced inio the hands of the Priest and his co- plotter, and they were stationed as sentinels at the top of the two stairways. 'The villains soon saw that the iplot, by premature explosion, had utterly failed, and Ithey only hoped now to'save their own necks by prompt obedience to authority. It was the holy father's at- tempt to make peace,'that helped to paralize the con- 8spirators below --he was a man ofpeace., "Blessed are the peace makers, for they shall be called'the children of God,' meekly said the Priest to himself. "Vi lain!" exclaimed Old Sol to George, "your con- federates are defeated." "( Not while Bardolph lives, old yellow boy!" "Bardolph! Hie is now assisting to disarm them." "Ha! Then here goes ship, soldiers, Adolfo, liberty; and all! He then ran towards the open, powder keg with his flaming torch. , Old Sol fired. The torch dropped from George's hand and went out. Darkness flew down upon the orlop deck. And rothinug was seen, nothing heard - nothi save a long groan. i;,                      ' ,   /          l,   CH APTEER LIV. THE DRUM    HEAD COURT MARTIAL. FROM peaceful slumbers to bloody work the soldier rises. From the land of dreams to eternity he flies, leaving his pale body to be hid away, and his name to be cherished with warm tears at some humble hearth- stone -and spelt wrong in the, gazette. The bodies of the brave soldiers who fell in the Muti- ny of the Gulf, were brought into the cabin, together with those of the fallen mutineers. Clincher and George lay side by side, and death waved over them  now  the white flag of final peace. Death is the great peace maker. Life is war. The heralds of one defy to combats, those of the other sound parley and truce. O, mortal breath! thou art a living poison. , Trea- sons, stratagems and spoils," mutinies and murders, banquet on thee at midnight. Death is thy antidote! The officers were gathered around the cabin table, their swords still wet by their sides, their pistols smok- ing before them.     i "I have summoned you," said Major June, standing         ,   THE  COURT-MARTIAL.        277J Par the head of the table, to inquire into this out- lreak. If possible you are to detect the ring-leaders.. I? you succeed, array them at once, try them, and pass' s;icl4 sentence as their crimes deserve and the general sefety demands. Having done this, /ou will lay your proceedirgs before me, I The Major then withdrew to look after the wounded 4ind, see to the guards, now quadrupled, and posted in Every part of the ship. The surgeon was already caring t r the former. The corporal of the guard was in ar- iest at t:e instigation of the drum major. As the mutineers were mostly members of the band, the'r chief was the first witness sworn. We shall not go into the details of that midnight -rifl, but point the reader to the main particulars. Before Bardolph began to give his evidence, the cor- Poral of the guard was brought in. Old Sol started back amazed; darting a severe look Upon the witness, he inquired- !' "Is this one of the accused?" : c' He is, sir." "-Be sure!  I saw this corporal fighting foremost. against the rebels." Most likely, sir. He had an object."  "Go ion, sir; go. on," saiLc Lieutenant Soldan, "begin at the beginning." The witness then swore that " this corporal bad long. 24   278       -   FACA. been tampering with the band, in fact ever since his arrest and confinement: that he had watched him, but knew not till this flight, what might be his motive. That he had overheard him and some of the band men talk of getting at the hospital stores. At the time he thought it was for brandy, but was now convinced it was for poison. The hospital steward might know more on this point. But he, the drum-major, was convinced that their plan to poison all the officers, had been discon- certed by his jumping out of his bunk to report them. The corporal had knocked him down in the band room - here was the bruise - and he lay there senseless, he knew not how long, but as soon as he came to, he heard a great :noise, saw that the band room was deserted, and went out to help quell the mutiny. He was sure that it had been precipitated through his unintentional means, and thanked God fervently that it had!" for doubtless his own 'worthless life, and the valuable services of all the officers, would have been lost to the country under whose proud flag they served.  He accounted for the corporal's fighting against the mutineers, on the suppo- sition that he musth have seen at once, from the luke- warmness of the soldiers generally, that the case was hopeless, and wished to save his own life by apparent zeal on the other side." The testimony of the hospital steward corroborated, the statement of the d rm-major. Poison had actually  '!    I     TIIE COUET-MARTIAL.!       279 been extracted from the box of medical stores, and the accused was on deckl and on guard at the very time  He could not have been many feet from the door. In MCej the; roomn: had' been entered twice, the' last time by )wc men, and yet the corporal had not prevented it. is orders were to allow no soldiers on, deck without /uficient reason. Again, how could the prisoner George Bave been released without the corporal of the guard's connivance? ' The clouds gathered thick and black around his head. Xhe corporal stood lost in astonishment. Which way to urn1 for light he knew no:J. When' called on for his Iefence, he could only deny that he had heard or seen en enter the hospital steward's room, or that he had ver tampered with the band, or been privy to George's elzase. ' I would ask the prisoner a question," said Mr. Bar- lolph.   - "Ask it," said the court, "the prisoner may use his- pleasure about answering it." ' Were you not in the '3and room after taps, when you should have been abed, last night?" ;' es,. said the prisoner boldly, "but I cannot, even 'to saver my life, tell how it happened that' I was there; for I took a solemn oath of secresy - ' ^  : "An oath -of se'resy " exclaimed some. mbmber of bthe coLrt.   280         FA  A. This was enough. The accused was! then set aside and the general ex- amination continued. The members of the band, and others taken'in arms, were testified against as to the fact of their open mutiny.  But the corporal of the guard was thought to be the instigator and prime mover, in the drama, and the conclusion of the court was, that the two dead men, George and the ex-lawyer, 'were second in rank and iguilt to him. The younger officers were for pronouncing instant sentence of death. The president, lieutenant Soldan, alone hesitated. He had seen the prisoner fighting a half score of the rebels single handed. It was he that pointed out the danger of their getting the ammunition. Old Sol was in- a maze. The court was cleared-i. e., prisoners, witnesses, guards, all but the members of the court and the stone-dead bodies, withdrew. And now the findings and sentences were to be considered. To delay the punish- ment of subordinates was considered safe; but that of this arch plotter, this master mover, who could on the instant seize any future opportunity to renew, with bet- ter success, the horrors of this night- no. .fe must be condemned at once. Again, the court opened. Prisoner,' asked the president with a husky voice, "what is your name?"              I ^:'   '    ! i      * ^   T I iE C O U R T--M A R T I A L.  281 X William' Marshall, sir." "Corporal William  Marshall, the majority of the Court Martial are of the opinion that you are guilty of mutiny.- The cold dead bodies before you were once in- habited by warm living spirits, as hopeful of long life, as desirous of happiness, as just in all their earthly ex-, pectations as yourself. Though not by your hand, yet through your instrumentality, they have been cut off in the midst of their years. You will in a few hours, ,be summoned to meet them in another world, and at a higher bar. God have mercy on your soul, William, for:" priId the warm hearted soldier, writh moistened eyes, "I -annot on my life believe you guilty." "As I hope for happiness in that bright sphere to which my soul is destined to go, I declare I am not guilty," said the prisoner with icy calmness. I' "Before final sentence is pronounced, prisoner," said -the president, " have you anything to say that might in men's minds lessen the degree of your crime, your motives, your temptations, probably  some fancied wrong -  ?" i Nothing, sir. In the wide world there are none to mourn for William Marshal. Yet unknown as I am, the son of respectable parents, but long since dead, I ha;ve been taught to regard my honor more precious ,than life, and am ready to die at sunrise if may be, rather than break an oath.

Death las no terrors for me now. If you believe in my innocence, sir, that to me is far sweeter than life. And 1 am innocent. God knows I am, sir!" The unwilling-tears at last stole down his face.         . "Yes, he is innocent!" cried a voice. And old Ser- geant Trainor appeared, urging his way through the crowd in the cabin, and supporting his daughter Faca, pale 'as a sheeted ghost. i r          . I .   I* I I CHAPTER IV. THE LADY AND THE GIANT. IN order to bring up the threads of our narrative, it s r-ecessary to go back to the moment when Faca fell :ai:ting into the arms of M-. Bardolph. I The gleam that shot fron- his baleful eyes, the light- ting of his cloudy soul, gave token of triumphant joy wit-in. i "Ha! ha! mistress," he cried exultingly, as the door closed, leaving. him alone with he4 .

HiS rude fervor, however, quickly restored her to life, an;n the keen bright spirit darted back to its throne from the realm of shadows, in time to save its beautiful pure tenements from further pollution. The white leaf on her '0osom lay unbrushed by his foul hand, and the sweet :ose bud at her heart remaired unconscious of the worm. Starting wildly she sprang from his arms, but would t.!                  ,       A   '284         FACA. have fallen had he not caughllt her again, and gently resting her upon the camp-stool, he assumed a respectful attitude before her. Faca pressed both hands to her temples, doing what she feebly might to collect her scat- tered senses, "Mr. Bardolph?" she said with a bewildered look. "It is I." "Those rough rude men! that dreadful song! my name! did no one call it?" "You are safe now. I might have uttered your name, I that love you to madness," he exclaimed falling up- on his knees before her. '( You love me -you?  i"Yes, with all my heart, my heart of -hearts." "Then -- let me go." "You may." He flung open the door. ' The weak girl arose and tottered forward. "Let me assist you," he said. She moved'passively on. "Then you will listen to me; let me love yon?" he asked imploringly, and so respectfully. The color flashed across her pale cheek; "No. I hate you." "Ha! he cried savagely. The door was reclosed, and Bardolph stood before her with folded arms. Faca felt her senses reel' again, but she made an almost stperhumanefeort to keep up. The good angels   THE  LADY  AND  THE    OIAANT.  285 ' assisted her, but so'faint and' feeble was she with weak- ness, disordered nerves, and terror, that she was constrain- ed to seiek again the seat;she had just left.

'I'his is an hour I have long coveted, and since you can not go if you would, we will talk over our affairs. I Now listen: I was once a youth of promise, my family was respectable, or, as they say, aristocratic. I have the pure blaod of old Castile in my veins.

You have a sister? You? I could not believe it! ' ("Yes, Faca," replied Batdolph with heart-touching grief upon his smooth countenance. "She was an only sister. I loved her. I could have forgiven them for wronging my father and me, but for tossing her into a the wild hurricane of events- which crushed a fragile flower, for that I curse them!" Faca shuddered at his fierceness. "Now, proud girl, know that I have it in my power to raise myself again to affluence, honor, power; and you may be the'sharer of my splendid fortunes. Come, decide iww, for I must go."-  The voices -had gone on increasing. The whole ship was evidently astir. People were even rushing through the passage going by the band-room door. "Will you. be mine?" cried Bardolph, " my love, my ,queen?," Faca's heart was torn. She knew that the :cebels were fully at work. Should thley succeed, what would be the fate of her parents, William, Old Sol, and all the officers? She knew now that Bardolphll was their leader- to keep him from  his conifeerates, above whom she ' knew 1he towered in intellect --to makle use of the fatal - beauty, her natural, God-ordained dowryy, to save the precious lives of those she loved; in short to make the   THE- LADY   AND  TIIEI GIANT.   287. mcst of -Ahe situation in which-she was placed, for the good of others -- and then she thought, and shuddered not, death might end her: woes at any moment. Such iwe-e the- thoughts that flew wildly through her brain. To delay! him was her wish. But speech she;could-,not suficient'y - 'inand. The report of a pistol was heard. Mr. Bardolph was frantic with impatience. Greed of power and wealth, centered in the operations of the night, were fighting at his heart's door with the giant passion for this -beautiful woman before him. He stamped   .. (, Time is, more precious than money, daggers, pistols, or cannon,'he said," ' will you be mine?" - "'If---  ," Faca f!altered." "No if's shall stop me,", he cried, flinging' his arms about wildly. "I 'll break the opposing world to pieces, pluhk up society by the roots, invade islands, conquer kingtoms, plant you. on thrones, with nations at your feet. Ha! let him who dares now come between Adolfo and. his love, beware!

Her long white light-robe -hung down to the floor. A mantle partly covered her wildly-dishevelled grizly hair. In her hand she held her crucifix-- tightly-- tightly. Bardolph started back, no less astonished at the spectral vision than incensed at the intrusion. Faca threw herself sobbing hysterically upon the bosom of her faithful old nurse, "Save me! save me! - that man! -- that giant!- that demon!" Something was on the lip of Constanza, but it died away beneath the terribly'intense glare'of those cold black eyes, as they were bent upon the man, convulsed with rage before her. He was the first to break the awful silence, as Constanza stood rivetting and riveted to the spot, glaring and still glaring upon him with those unearthly eyes. "Speak, ghost, or woman? who art thou?" [ "Thou  thou -- thou --- do I not know thee? Adolfo Jarero -that is - thy name!"

"This girl I will protet" He moved towards the door and put his hand gertly upon the duenna s arm. "Come, Constanza, leave us." She shook'him off. " Whati a great villain thou art become, boy," she. said bitterly. "In, thy dear mother's' name, in thy angelic sister's, I command thee desist from-thy hor- rible purposes." "Fool! go to thy bed and mumble prayers to thy saints." "-Adolfo!" she hissed between her teeth in Spanish, "this is thy sister's child!" Adolfo-staggered back and gazed upon Faca. "Thou liest woman! I see no trace of likeness, her features, her eyes, so different. But say so, say so,- I am her uncle. It is ny right to protect her. Go to I bed!  I 'll not answer eden for thy life, if seen." ( I will nottrust you Adolfo. Come mychild."

THE blow which felled Bardolph stunned him, a man of herculean' strength, but for the moment. .When he arose, his transports were sensibly moderated. He went f6rward instantly, howerer, to take that part in the fray which policy might point out on the spot; for he was a man of quick observation and ready decision. He saw there was no chance for his party, and resolved to save himself at any sacrifice. He knew that Marshal was corporai of the guard that night, and such a sac-ifice-his rival! was: doubly welcome - coupled witk revenge! 'And now Bardolph's triumph seemed complete. Final sentence was about to be pronounced: sunrise was to witness its execution at the yard-arm. "Ha! ha!"lhe fiercely laughed to himself; when *   V        "  '   192          F AAC.

Although the testimony in the case was closed, and otwithstanding the members of the court seemed un- lakably convinced of the corporal's guilt, yet at Lieu- mnant Soldai's urgent solicitation, the new evidence :as admitted. The drum-major's hopes revived as Faca told all she new. It really amounted to little by itself, an d as prayed against the overwhelming weight of evidence gainst the prisoner,- it amounted to nothing at all. The fact that she heard the whisperers under her indow mention so often the word " corporal,' seemed strengthen the case against him. Evidently, thought le wise court, some "corporal" must have ,been in the lot, and ;who so likely as the corporal of the guard, nder whose very eyes, ears,.and nose so much had been one before any alarm was given? Besides, Faca could- not swear that the prisoner was ot in the room with the revelers, among whom, it ap- eared to 'the charitably' disposed court, Bardolph was 'rced to mingle for his own safety.

THE solemnities of the execution of the drum-major and the priest, together with their burial, and that of Clincher, George, and the others, in a common sepulchre, the sea, occupied the morning following that fearful outhreak on the Gulf of Mexico.   The beautiful burial service was read by Swallow, and one by one the bodies of our brothers were committed to the deep, there to 'behold ---  , A thousand fearful wrecks : A thousand men, that fishes gnawed upon: Wedges of gold,- great anchors, 'heaps of pearl, Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, ' All scattered in the bottom of the sea.

I Before Acolfo was executed, the duenna, with many tears --the- first the stern woman had shed for years over her own sorrows, though her Ihert was like a child's over anotherfs - was suffered to see, him alone. Then the secret of the unfortunate man's birth was explained. Constanza had lost her husband the first year of her marriage, ar d the child was adopted by Don Manuel and Donna Jarero, to whom an heir was long denied. l It was to secure his fortune that she gave him away. But see to wLat he had come! Afterwards her mistress was blessed with Jorge and Francisca.

The sons of sorrow are all a common brotherhood, with Christ at their head; yea, even the malefactors on the cross.-  Mother ani son sobbed and wept bitterly till those came who were to bear him to executio'. Then there'. was a long embrace. ,The two pressed the crucifix to- gether with their lips. The son was carried away, and went to his appointed place among the; dead. The mother stayed; she had fyet her place among the living. Faca remained to her, the last of the beloved family. She flung herself upon the floor of ler state-room, and there, a-one with God, she gathered up the loins of her heart.   CHA PTER    LVII.      . THE WORLD CO'NTINUES TO REVlO LV VE.

The idea may, be suggested by the indentation it makes into the continent; but even that is vast, stretching across eighteen degrees of longitude, and around thou- sands of leagues of shore; whereas the idea of a 'gulf' conveys littleness of magnitude." '"The sailors, even, call it the 'bay,'" said Captain Handsallaround, " to distinguish it from the gulf stream, which they call' the gulf,' as crossing the'Mediterranean they call ' going up the straits.'  "It is a larger body of water than the AMediterranean, sir," replied the major warmly, "and much larger than the Baltic, Black, Caspian, or a multitude of ponds dig- ;nified iwith the name of seas.'" "It is glorious, sir, in its associations too, reflecting the fame of Isuch men as Columbus, Co tez, De Soto, a score of- our American admirals, and our gallant old chief, Winfield -Scott, long life and green laurels to him!    :  "The Spaniards called it the 'Mexican sea,' why should not tLe Americans? shall they do it less honor, sir?    i The attention of all future geographers is hereby called to this subject, on the peril of another blast from the major.

It was not Junks for another, although he still  dreamed of " that gall," and hoped fondly to " splice " before autumn.   -  But Old Sol   . He was certain that Faca had not only proved, herself a genuine lady, but a true wo- man, and he was rmore deeply in love than ever. And William 5Marshal was one.' Strange to say, the youth was willing to live now. He was regarded by all as the hero of the late event. And he had some reason, though little enough, to hope that FLca wras not so very indifferent towards him after all. O0 no! William was in no hurry to die no1w.   THE  ANGEL   WAJITS.      V1o And Faca, she was the third'; it was now such a ques-i tion of, life and death with her, this world or the next,  that even she was infatuated with the wish of spending, more days here on earth, though few an'd full of trouble they were likely to prove. Poor Faca, the little goddess was sick. The events of the last few days have prostrated her low upon a mortal bed. The Helen, for" whom. heroes and giants have contended, lifts her wan eyes tothe ceil- ing of her chamber, and looks back into a dreary, hor- rid waste she sees up there, wishing that in the midst of it all she had died - but now, O! now, Faca would live.        - The good surgeon shakes his head dubiously. And, Mrs. Trainor, the bunchy little woman so bustling before, is quiet now, and sad, looking often into the eyes of her daughter, "to see what she wants," she says; but Faca: knows full well that is not it; she knows that anxious look too well ; it has a far off gaze, where Death sits on the tomb. O! Faca cannot, will not die!

THE ANGEL FLIES AWAY. And, thou, too, whosoe 'r tho'i art, That readest this briefpsalm, As one by one thy hopes depart, Be resolute and calm. ' LONGFErALLow. THAT high-spirited, impetuous girl, roused lately into the heroic woman, is strangely subdued. Religion has. effected a lodgement upon the crest bf her proud earth- works, and erected there the banner of heaven. Few women, when young and fair, know rPeligion in its power, and bow with supreme submission to .its' wonderful demands.  Prayers, entreaties, teairs alms, and thanks- givings form but the waves on the surface of that sea; far down below lies the mighty region, calm but omni- potent in its clear depths; and deep, deep in trouble must the soul descend ere it reaches the hidden realm; for not by searching with the eye car- one find out the Almighty to perfection.  - Faca is not only willing to live, but she is willing to die--to accept life with its trials, or death with its terrors. The pride of her youth and beauty, the supe- 26^  I.     .    x 306   -       A  ACA. rioritfy of ier intelligence, the waywardness of her bright falcon spirit; all that had buoyed her tip to a dazzling elevation above the rank and caste to which she belong- ed, gave way before religion, and she shone with its feinlnine grace and splendor. It was with increasing fear and anxiety that Sirs. Trainor- beheld this angelic force, before which her daughter was being borne away. There are-certain signs ,indicative of departure from  this world, tl-at women are quick to detect. They show themselves in the precocious intellect of children " too good to live," and play in a halo of pale light around the faces of men "too Iperfect for earth." It is certainly a "bad sign 7 in those we love to see them thus. O companion of my bosom! sharer of my daily cares, my daily joys, be of the earth earthy yet awhile! O child of my love! be thou a true son of Adam the fal- len! Heaven is a long way off to me, loved ones; tarry a while for me-even in sin! This is the natural language of the heart. It was with a feeling of like wistfulness and apprehension that Faca's foster-parents beheld their daughter lapsing into an angel. Their grief grew upon them till it clotLed them with it sown light, a shining raiment. And tleye too bowed before the will of God; bowed in all their grief, their self-conquest, their reconciliation to sorrow.

The sorrow of Old0 Sol was not lest touching of all.--  The veteran became a child. Life was now for the first time in twenty years a thing of tmoment. This wild surge drove him back to the green margin of youth. And the old soldier prayed vehemently for Faca's life. His face was suffused with the warm tears of his rein-: vigorated heart. . Awkwardly he went about, falling in every body's way, a broken-hearted boy. The grief that turns the hair grey makes the heart green, vivifies its dry dead branches; alive with the soft emotions of a leafy spring, the .oung verdure of sweet virtues trem- bles in the dawn of immortality. Old Sol suffered and bowed his heLd. We may not attempt to describe the afflictions of Wil- liam Marshal's soul. But his weepings were not like the others' --- youfig men with the young giant within them, God does not prostrate so complely as he doth the elders. But in the solemn light of Faca's face he swore that his one ruling vice should no longer have dominion over him --- and for the twc score years of after life he will keep his vow, for it is registered and sealed above. Then, when the Almighty had 'turnedi the hearts qf these his simple children towards himself, he took pily on their grief. The dread crisis passed with its long i    . 3.0S       r?FACA. agonizing' night of terrors; the hope, the fear, the doubt, the trembling expectancy, the hushed breath, the faint lost pulse, the loud ticks of the watch falling like hammers upon the sounding silence; the coming breath, the creeping warmth, the softening skin, the returning eye, the new life, the joy, thanksgivings, con- gratulations--fearful even yet of full utterance-- all passed. Morn came, and the waiting angel flew away with the pale sickly shadow of her damp cold wing.    ,     i ; ,           r ,   -HAAPTER     LXI. THE COAST. THERE is a current commonly along the coast of Texas; and, setting in to the southward now, it had carried the Aldebaran below the point she wished to make, viz: Aranzas Inlet. But as she approached the coast by night, she hove to, and lay by till morning, when a favorable'breeze brought her by seven o'clock opposite the bar. According to dead reckoning the ship should have been one hundred and fifty miles inland--but dead reckoning is not always dead certainty, as doubt- less we have all experienced, whb never went to sea. "There is the Bar, with the green and white breakers dashing over it," said Major June. "Ciistopher! sir! I remember, as it were yesterday, the emotions of us all in General Taylor's army, as we saw the land likely to become, as it did, the starting point to fame fcr some, and to the grave for others of out brave fellows. There is St. Joseph's Island, on which we first encamped, and a more forsaken-looking place, a more c esolate, dreary, sandy shore, was never known. However the first live object we saw was a deer, /       i,     A.        .:   310  !         ,AC A. and then we :found some turtle.  You see now a few cattle grazinglon the scanty grass, and there is a little shrubbery, and on the inner side a few wreckers' houses. Every face was turned towards the shore. A feeling of great satisfaction was apparent, mingled with a shade of doubt concerning thy sort of life likely to be encoun- tered in Texas. - In thel minds of many young soldiers, the vista stretching across those sand hills was filled with- wild sports, moonlight scouting expeditions, game, and 'Cumanches. Before others arose the fatigue of sol- dier life, the diseases of a tropical clime, the absence from home comforts and civilized refinements. But as white wing after white wing of the little light- ing vessels was raised and became visible ,beyong St. Joseph's Island, on their way out to the ship, the busy din of preparation to disembark began to be heard on all sides. A steamship lighterl was expected to be ir- readiness, but no such appeared, pr other sign of her presence. The truth is, our venerable Uncle Sam is so poor, that he can afford but one steamer for such purposes on the whole coast, from the Florida Capes to the Bio Grande, aud this vessel cannot :rtionally be expected to divide herself and be in two places at once. Fortunately for Major June's command, tiere was no angry wind or raging sea to prevent the lit-le smacks that made   their appearance in Aranzas Inlet, from    THE  COAST.         11 - coming to the ship, anchored a league from the bar; and out they came, each one intent-on a "government job." The first- one hailed was a sloop. The sloop was steered by a piratical looking chief, who lay stretched at full length upon the deck, with his arm dangling carelessly over the rudder, as if his clipper steered her- self. Before him lay spread out temptingly two im-  mense turtles, nicely dressed, and a few quarters of fresh beef. He was evidently ready, first to feed the soldiers and then help them ashore, the former at no'little ex- pense. He drew along-side in the same non-chalant manner as he had tumbled through the breaEers and sailed out. Captain Handsallaround, however, thought best to question this matter-of-course character before heaving him a line. ( Are you chartered by the quartermaster?" "Then haul off." The master of the sloop gave one careless glance, as he turned his back on the skipper, by throwing one leg over the other, an sheered off, cool and sheered off, coollyanswering Toute la meme chose! a I don't care a "( He does care a good deal," said Major June, laugh- ing, " for he has no other way of disposing of his fresh provisio-s. But to conceal anxiety is the great aim of Texan character."           - 4,-       ,   $12  ,        FACA.            The next vessel that succeeded in mak:ng the Aide- baran was a neatly painted small schooner in the regu- lar employ of the quartermaster. She ar-chored a few fathoms astern of the ship, lowered her jolly-boat, the master jumped in, and pulled by a Mexican, came along- side. The ladder was let down and he 'appeared on the deck of the Aldebaran. The officers gathered eagerly around him, anxious for news from the States; but the coast-wise Texans are as indifferentlabout news as they seem to be about every thing else- railroads and tele-  graphs included-further inland.   He brought the necessary directions for disembarking, however, and the work speedily went on. It took six of the lighters. Two of these were clean and tolerably comfortable: the others- less said about them the better, for Uncle's poor !   Olr fair inva- lid, Faca, was let down gently by means of ropes and blankets into one of the former, and its little cabin was given up to her and her foster-father's family. The men and women descended the steel, deep sides of. the ship by means of the ladders, amidst a shower of knapsacks, camp kettles, bedding, mess chests, mirrors, canteens, carpet bags, loose gowns, overcoats, dress caps, night caps, epaulettes, sabres, pet dogs, parrots, young -infants, and muskets; all tossed into the- lighters hur- riedly and with storm-like confusion, as the wind and sea arose in the afternoon, and threatenec a " blow,"   THE  COAST.

As we 'havy said, Captain Redeliffe had had his day. And after getting the Dolly safely over the Bar into Aranzas Inlet, being forced-by the approach of night to drop anchor in one of the little Lagoons which con- nect the Inlet, with Corpus Christi Bay, he invited our friend Old S1 to a dish of frejoles, cooked by one of' the Mexicans, and then told the officer his history.

THE CAMPI P By noon the next day the whole of Major June s domn-   : mand was encamped near Corpus Christi, on the ground occupied, asi the major stated, by the gallant Wortl --  the Murat of our army in the Mexican war. A tent was pitched for Faca and her grandmother. Faca was now able to sit up, and the sea-breeze over the  -.- high ground, the smell of the green grass, and the fresh diet, soon invigorated her.                 - But a few days, and the present array of friends  officers and soldiers who ,loved her, and who took every method possible to soothe the rigor of:lher low condition, as the daulghter of a camp wonman, must break up into   :,i small detachments. And she witl one of ,these must go to some post among strangers,--possibly among 3men, some at least; of whom, loing exiled from the sight  - of so much beauty as hers, would 'feel themselves prirve-  leged'to prey upon lher.              '  This her lot, Old Sol looked upoll with as much aver- .
