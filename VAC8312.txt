Canada, and there, to my surprise and delight, I f

heartily at my simplicity in making such a purc
him earnestly that the celebrated La Salle, and th
Marquette, nay, probably Montcalm himself, had
laughed the more; and that too in spite of my
that these men rere all highly distinguished in
his own land-for he had never heard of one of
him that I had once woru them myself, and that,
the long and wintry road which led up to what 1
I had secured thus far in life, he grew serious a
enough to believe me-his gay humor rose even t
On being questioned, he told me that Shoepacs

SH OEPAC RECOLLECTIONS,.
CHAPTER I.
OUR CITY.
OuRs was a little antiquated city. Its inhabitants
were mostly F ench. At the time I came upon the
stage of events, the transition to a modern American
town had scarcely commenced. The body of the popm.
lation was still f the ancient 4sgime. The few Ameri-
cans were offices, or ex-officers, of either the general or
territorial gove nment, and their families, relations,
dependents, and friends, whom they had persuaded to
venture beyond the "jumpingoff place," as Buffalo
was then termed. The spirit of emigration had not
been fully aroused ; and the spirit of speculation, if felt
at all, was confided to the fur-traders, a class made up
of all nations.
I cannot compare the society more nearly than to that
of some princip d East India Company station in a city
of ilindostan. There were the governor of the terri-

tory and his family, the judicial, executive, and military
functionaries, with their families and dependents; like
subahdar, nabobs, begums, and ;the lesser light_-
traders and natives, French, Indian, and half-breed.
But one could not well imagine a pleasanter state of
feeling than mutually existed, with sufficient distinction
between the different -castes er classes to prevent
wrangling, and yet sucient community of interest,
prejudice, and please  to make everybody sociable.
The French gave a tone of gaiety-the military, bath'
elevation and hospitality.  There were balls, where
everybody danced with everybody's wife and. daugh-
ter. There were theatr cals, where the most. dignified
geihtlemen took parts. .t may be a mere whim, but I
think I never have elsewhere met such easy polish and
affability among.gentle- en.' There was no touchiness
about position in the  ocial scale, and consequently
neither stiffness nor a  station; and to this day, the
same easy grace of man er is notable among the sons
and daughters of the go d old city.,
The traveller, journeying at that period from Kew
Yqlwestward, after leaving Albany, penetrated into
regions where civilization grew dimner and dimmer as
he'advanced until he   ecame quite certain of having
pased. the ultima thule, when he would stumble with
astonishment on our littl community. There he would

Often he may meet on the sidewalk an Indian-so e

like the crest of a helmet on his head; or, peradven-
ture, groups of Winnebagoes, with blue blankets ;on
heir handsome squawswile their own arms, ears, and
noses would jixigle with silver ornaments; or, skuking
along, some thievish craven of a Mennomonie, whose
name was no le3 a term of reproach among the nobler
tribes, than that of the Samaritan with the disdainful
ch ldien of Judab. Passing above the town' he might
find large conical, birch-bark tents pitched on the long
slope of the river baik, and graceful, light pirogues
dwn up in regular rows on the shore; these belong to
thfi Indians, whom he may, if it chance to be payment
eason, behold in hundreds, or even thousands, Succo-
tash isboilingi huge iron or brass pets over the fires.
A sma     rmy of famished, wolfish-looking dogs -lie
arouniking lazily in the sun; and no smaller army
xnaked children are running every where-smew

He would met pretty, fawn-faced young squaws
who glince cog ettishly at him, and-no less at theui
selves, or rather some ornament,or little rude mirror
half-concealed o their persons. Now ard then one
peeps at him frn behind the blanket at the tent-door:
Respectable el$rly women wpuld be sitting around
work on moco4e, mats,. or moccasins, or cooking gane,
or pilfered chickms in the sugar-boiler, or smoking fish
depending from a stick sustained over the fire by two
forked upr-ights  Shame to the Pale Faces !-heniight
hear drunken noises issuing from a lodge herend
there; or worse,-set an Indian and hiswife, or sev
squaws by themselves, alternately caressing each h
and quarreling    , moved by the demon that lurks nl

fortinate the Gothamite might deem himself to witness
an Indian dance at that comparatively primitive period.
As he strolls out further from the town, he is struck
with, apeculiarity in the. divisions of the farms; for
bach one is but a narrow strip of land running back into
the woods two or three miles, so that every farmer may
havea front on the river. A hundrd or so yards from
the beach stands the farm-house, imilar to those already
described, with only more amplitude of dimensions, and
a broad,'indolent, sun-loving porch, on which sleeps an
olddog--practised no less in raccoon lore th n experi-
enced in swimming after-wild-ducks. In coy famili-
arity, an old cat is blinking by his side, or purring as
shegrubs her electric coat against his shaggy hair ; or
perched upon- his back, a piping chicken is with dijfl-
cuity balancing itself; s it picks at the flies which buzz
around his nose, or alight with a tickling mischief on
his lazily-flapping ears.
In front of the house are the cherry-trees, and in rear
the pear and .apple-orchards ; and the traveller is sur-
j raised to find the best of fruit thusfar beyond the pale
of civilization-fruits brought from sunny France, and
pIuted by the skillful Jesuit; apples, red to the core,
,argeland luscious; cherries that rival nectarines; and
pears of every variety- and of every season, irom July
to November. Nor will the patch of onions es ape his
notice: it is a Frenchman's flower-garden-the invari-
Aie concomitant of &amp;very family who may claim a foot
square of mother earth.   The fish-net, or seine is

a long pirogue, or more ample Mackinaw boat-per-

appear in style at Detroit--the greater station, and
nearer civilization. Probably the present is the gad
occasion to which they have looked forward, and they
have talked over their plans, concerning tfor m
many months.    Each gcrgon has a sash 'around  is
waist, and pulle a red .oar. TJiey keep perfect timi-
and' it is joyous quick time-with the notes of a Frenh

and such was the society in its primitive state. .
My father was an Englishman. Beiinig a younger son,
his chances in merry old England seen ed slim enough.
With what little cash he could command, he- had
departed from the ancestral halls, in the north of Eng-
land, hear the little town of Keswick, for America. He
was a mere youth when he landed at New York; but
fortunately his letters secured the good will of Mr. John
Jacob Astor, then an active fur'. trailer, who at once,
appointed him an agent in the American Fur Company,
and without any delay he set -out for he little city of
Detroit, the head-quarters of his future business opera-
tions    '

that a man entrusted by God with a family, should be
patience and deliberation.personified--but it was more
extensively useful in his dealings with the wild sons of'
the forest. To any stranger, Mr. March would appear.
in the mild light of a gentle spirit whom nothing might
ruffle. But on many occasions, Pigeon-hawk, the name
by which he was known among the Indians, had dis-
phLyed more of the fierceness of the hawk than of the
meekness of the dove, particularly when his anger was
aroused by treachery or oppression. In the main, the
children of the woods respected my father for his vir-
tues, and thought him very honest-for a white man.
The several children that clustered upon the parental
boughs displayed; even at no late period of their child-
history, greater or less evidence of their connection with
the paternal trunk, not unmingled, however, with the
tokens of my mother's excellence. In early. life, she
appeared little other than warm affection and easy good
humor; but time and trial proved that there lay dor-
mant energy itself.
There were four of' us: John, the eldest, had inherited
his father's quick boldness of spirit ; my brother Gail-
ford: his :more deliberate fire; Maud, our only sister,
standing in age between John and Guilford, gave signs
of patience, tethered with courage, yet both disguised
under a self-distrust, often laughable to behold, so super-
fuous and surprising was it in its manifestations ; as for
me, I may in all modesty be allowed to show myself out
in the course of this eventful history.

could prevail on my mother to disclose. Such, how-
ever, was the fact. But I was the plainest, and, I rather
suspect, the dullest of the family, and no favorite at first
with even my excellent mother.. And so it may have
happened, after all, .that I fell to my father for his sym-
pathy and compassion. This gave me some pride, this
apparent partiality over ,he other children;who, I always,
fancied envying me. He always seated me next him-
self at table, and cut up my food very nicely; and they
have all since declared that this early care he took is the
reason why I am an inch the tallest of the three
brothers.
I remember that there was a desk-is not that desk
my own sacred property at this moment --with very
tall legs, I then thought, standing in one corner of the
room Mr. March used as his library, but which was our
favorite.sitting-room. Whenever -he came home fro
his business, and particularly after any long absence, h.
would go straight to the desk, and draw forth cakes ani
confections, or sometimes even a more valuable gift. It
was always well known who for. At any rate, I knew
better where they went than how they ever got there,
which to -this day remains as perfect a mystery as the
means by Phich the stones were laid at Baalbec.
Then it was my peculiar destiny never to touch a dish
of glass, or other breakable, without the ensuing of a
crash.; and furthermore, it never was my good fortune
to escape therefrom without an energetic thump of the
thimbled finger of my mother, or a sly pinch "from my

Shortly afterwards came sorrow ; and Beauty and Sor-
row have ever visits me together, like loving twin
sisters.
Our visit lasted a week. We set out to return at sun-
set.  It was a beautiful moonlight night. The 'canoe
was loaded down with the good things we brought away.
There were bushels of hickory nuts, and a basket of
hens' eggs, with some great goose eggs that took my eye
-I had found them, too, hid away somewhere under the
barn; some white wool for Mrs. March to spin and
weave into home-made woolen sheets, a bag of the
reddest apples inahe world, and a little box in which I
brought home a pair of doves. But the air was laden
with miasma. Mr. March, Maud, all of us except Mrs.
March, were in a few days.successively prostrated with
the fever. My mother nursed us all. Nothing seemed
to bewilder or confound her. Nothing was too arduous
for her to do. She was everywhere at the same moment.
When the house grew still at night, she would suffer the
,neighbors, who were ever ready, to relieve her.. But
not a voice of pain issued from a roob ut 'it reached
her ear, and she' stood over the bed *ith cooling drink
or soothing balm. Her very hand was 'magical on my
own heated temples.
After a while, one after another recovered, save one-
the one, the all in all to my mother and to me. I remem-

there was nothing to be seen but tears, or,  hat was
worse, the sudden stoppage of tears whenever they saw
me coming, while they glanced stealthily at me and
whispered to each other,

Walter !"

Mr. March had eft his affairs in a poor way. Exten-

the desired results: next ear, the ignis fate  of for-
tune-hunters, the maid of the mist that draws them into
the vortex: next year! the rock on which so many
stately ships have split.  The mind to calculate, the
hand to guid , were gone. Everything was found to be
inextricably 'onfused, overharged, pledged, mortgaged,
embarked- othing brought to port, nothing matured
to hand and ready for use. The very house in which.

Professor March haddied. His death was announced

whom and Mr. March a warm      correspondence had
since been kept up, till the day of his illness. .e  had
often visited the ladies; for on going to New York on
yalbusiness, be never was so engrossed -as to lose.
sight of the claims of friendship and kindred.  He
always returned home with so ;much to', tell us : ,what
great men he had .seen-Lafayette, or the eloquent
Mr. Clay, whom he admired to the skies. In fat ahe
frequently went to Washington for the;soleapurposO of
seeing the world, which he thought less provincial at the
political capitol than at the greater metropolis of .cm-
merce. How he, a business man, could devote so much
time' to his family, to his friends, and to the improve-
ment of his noble nature, I cannot understand, since the
spirit of present progress has seized me.
" He had better have stuck to his business," snarls
out Adolphus Fitz-Mammon of Pearl street.
Perhaps he had.
At any rate, confess we must, that there were we, his
wedded wife, now a' Vpoor widow, and his lawful chil-
dren, now penniless, at the foot of the ladder, about to
start away on the ocean of life, and forced from the tart
to paddle our own canoe.

for our family pride, but for thy sake-that the back-
ward st te of those times would n6t furnish Mrs. March
with geiteel labor-embroidery, Tax-work, writing for
newspapers or magazines, lecturin on.the rights of the
softer sex, God bless them. Indeed there seemed to
have been no machinery set in otion, by upheavings
of the 4cial world, for raising the wind wherewithal to
bear up conscious dignity, suffering under a cloud.
These days of such blessed  o t-cuts to fortune and
came ar paradisaical, when compared with those long,
ol1-fashionel, .rugged roads up the hill.  With due
shamefacedness, I confess that Mrs. IMarch, my mother,
and ,he widow Qf a rather ,disti guished ian, took in
washing. Though shrarelylen over the tub herself,
yet many ,  night have I. laid s;n! g snder her ironing-
table, yetending to sleep, so that she might feel free to
sigh aloud in the midnight houa, as she wearily and
heavily leant on the smoothing-iron.
It was sixmonths after the gr at catastrophe before
Mrs. March could, earning the ainly subsistence the
while, 4o anything beyond ,getting John to Cambridge,
with the fee necessary to enter .tbe preparatory school.
During the remainder of this  ear, sufficient money
must be sorsped tog her  r the firt payment due on
tthc9 age which was once onr,0. n. The good people
of th N   A alledit Lilac!tag M; t stood on the dge
of the itiy,b at the extrermity of a ,little green lawn,
shaded on the two sides by elms and logusts-.

labor of each tiny hand, yet no sooner had Ithe blue-bird
began to pipe for spring than my mother said we must
make ready for school. .Accordingly, as soon as the
weather settled a little, and the clamp earth began to
grow dry, we started on a bright, breezy Moaday morn-
ing for our schools-Maud one way, and Guilford and
I another. The lilac bushes nodded us a morning fare-
well as we set out.
I do not remember that the boys; our schoolfellows,
treated us any the worse afterI our misfortune. Boys
are nobler little fellows than they are generally written
-noisy, mischi vous rascals as they are. But Maud,
on the other ha d, did mention,in a quiet, uncomplaining
way, some notable instance of insolence off the part of
her school companions.
"I am not surprised, my de r," said Mrs. March;
"we are very poor, and must not expect to escape the
load of obloquy which poverty is liable to carry. Let
your manners be simple, and your behavior aprtdent
as I hope it may be innocent, and you will soori begin
to see rise up around you a respect more v4,uable than
that paid to mere wealth."
We all looked on and listened with a sort of growing
solemnity, till my mother closed this, the logest
harangue of her life.
It must be acknowledged, in extenuationof the en

Magroy was a Scot and had taught school. With his
Greek and his Latin, hip latitudes: and longitudes, Old
Growl bestrode the world of classics and sciences, as he
domineered over mankind's children. Who that went
to school at that memorable time, but remembers the
terrible visitor? And who that ever struck a plum from
the bending boughs of his plum trees, that doth not
repent in Greek and Latin to this day?
Mr. Magroy was a father.
The best natured, the most careless, idle, truant blade
of a boy in the wliole city, was Allen Magroy, only
child of Old Growl. Allen h d been the devoted
admirer and sworn cavalier of dur Maud, ever sin e

his hands behind him through the little orchard into the
kennel, his cane tail-like dragging behind.
Then Allen began to wear a long face, and for the first
time in his life looked serious. And poor Maud began to
think she must not as much as look on an LL. . s'son,
now that she was the daughter of a working woman ; and
so treated Allen with quite chilling reserve, and avoided
him on all possible occasions. Allen would throw him-
self in her path between home and school, and on Sunday
afternoons as she came back from church. She never
so much as referred to Mr. Magroy, but she' potested
against Allen's desperate behavior. In fact Maud was
a great deal prouder than ever she knew of.
Allen clungto her with Scotch pertinacity. He was
now eighteen, amanly looking  fellow with 'dark hair
and mahogany colored eyes; -he had a lithe figure, and
there was that grand air about him in all his in olence,
that we sometimes see with so much.pleasure in the
strut of a gallant.soldier, as if he knew he had a perfect
right to it. Yet as we have said, Allen was a careless,
unstudious fellow, which was but too perceptible in the
devil-may-care manner he carried about with him, except
when in the presence of our sweet Maud. He was
bound to her by no slender tie, viz., gratitude, a cable on
the heart:of a boy, though soon reduced to a cobweb in

MY father's friend, M. Latrobe, was a French gentle-
man; he rejoiced in it. He was born in Paris. le
remembered Napoleon--had.'seen him, spoken with
him.' Napoleon was his idol, of all hero divinities in
clay. Every new day he told a new anecdote concern-
ing the emperor.
M. Latrobe was not tall-rather short and roundish.
His years nuinbered fifty, and yet spring sat upon his
face, laughing at winter on his head. He was a gentle-
man of the old school, and handed you his snuff-box
v*ith a polished air. His eyes were piercing black; his'
mouth, sharp, -judicious little niuth, yet almost girl-..

My mother was delighted to see him again ; and

adventures in boats, on snowshoes, and in shoepacs,*
had been told, aid where Napoleon never had been for.

" How are all our friends at Mackinac ?"'asked my

"Ah! madam" he replied in a softer tone, "you

M. Latrobe raised his eyes to the picture of my father
with such affecti n, such sadness, depicted on his coun-

"I am   ready to weep for you, madam-and for

The two gentle spirits, knit together by love for a
common object, buried their faces in their handker-
chiefs, and wept.,
.I. Latrobe was the first to speak. He told her of
the interest manifested at Mackinaw in the f rtunes of
my mother, and of, their grief over what was felt as a
loss common to all. He spoke of a trunk-full of pre-
sents they had sent her and Maud. The Indians had a
superstitious reverence for Maud, on account of her
hair. The Dove of Pigeon-Hawk was invested with
unearthly attributes, and strings of wampum attested
their homage.
But M. Latrobe had a great favor. to ask.
"I have long desired, madain, to place in your hands
the keeping of my little daughter, Ma Belle."
Mrs. March looked surprised-
"Do not refuse me at once, wife of my old friend," he
said, with the voice of one who most required sympathy,
in attempting to bestow it. "Since the death of my
excellent wife, I take little satisfaction at home, and ami
absent so many months at once, I fear  a Belle will
grow up in the streets.
"My dear M. Latrobe," said my moth r, " is there
anything I may do for your child ?"'
".Ah  yes, madam, I desire her to be a lady, and
that she must become by no more than 1ving in the

"When I got to New York all I could do was to exclaim New York !
New York! such great three story'buildings, such a great post-office, such
banks, and so many people hurrying along. The shipping reminds me of
a forest of pine trees ; yes, a perfect forest of then.
Aunt Virginia was very  ad to see me, I think  I am glad you have
sent her money enough for my board, schooling and everything for the
year, as she is very poor. As you have not hear  anything about her
except what she used to write herself, I will tell you what Aunt Carrie
says. She says 'That V- was a great belle, and was quite celebrated at
Washington, Philadelphia,New York, even way downto New Orleans, and'
that  e had.many'offers '-which I can readily believe, as she is so good
and lady-like in her manners, and so beautiful, toot even now in her 40th
year. I will tell you and Maud just how she looks. Tall and straight,
fine neck, and person, large black eyes, slightly aquiline nose, black ring-
lets, an  such a musical ringing voice I never h ard. But she would
accept  obody, rich men, learned professors, statesmen, nobody, so
Aunt C. says. And what do you think is the reaso ? Why, Aunt Carrie
is blindly, and has three little fatherless children, an Aunt V. has devoted
herself to them all for life. Don't that sound like a omance ? It's almost
like   , mother. Well, Aunt C's. husband left little or nothing, so Aunt V.
who was unmarried when her father died, and left her everything, turned
it all into enough money to purchase this little place of a house and six
acres only, and here they live by raising vegetables which theysend to
Boston market to sell. Aunt V.. did not know anything abbut it, but she
got books, and read everything on such subjects, and now does very well
indeed.
"She teaches two of the children, the little girls, herself, and sends the
boy to school.- She says I must commence right off to go to school and
prepare for college by next year. My candle is most burnt down, so
good night-love to Gilly and Walter-kiss Maud.

from the shops of the above-mentioned tailors and shoe-
makers; and as seamstresses and shoe-bi ders never
since the world began were known to finish their work
before night, it fell out that my journeyings to the shops
of our patrons commonly took place at night.
Now, by chance, there was on'the street along which
travelled, a vacant house-a dreary, clapboard-rat-
tling, shutter-flapping, haunted house, which nightly
gave forth sounds, not unmusical, but unearthly. Oppo-
site the corner of this building there stood a white post,,
marking a boundary of the lots, and rejoicing near the
top in the two letters, O. Q., the initials of the owner
of the property.' It is needless to hint to the imagina-
tive reader, that those black letters shone forth from the
white post like two spectral eyes-dim, hollow, far.-
The supernatural 'sounds issuing from the haunted
house, together with the appearance of the v hite figure
-.demon-eyed--sometimes, in fact frequently,' con-
strained Walter March to quicken his footsteps as he
approached the fearful neighborhood, or to take the
middle or opposite side of the street-to whistle with
apparent unconcern-to -start with affright t the least
unusual object, man or beast, suddenly coming in sight
and in short, to' clear the infernal region at .a goodly
run.
It is equally needless to go into Iess important 'pasti.-
eulirs, such as the tenor of Walter March's dreams-
the nightmares that were bestrode by a familiar post--

ad lent wings to the speed with which  bounded out
after my brother.
"What is the matter ?" he asked, astonished at the'
sudden quickness of my movements.
"Did you not hear it ?" I asked, breathlessly.'
".Hear what ?"
".That noise ! those sounds ! that piteous complaint
in music !"
"My dear brother, I fear you are losing your senses ;
you will soon be demented. I will go up again and
listen, just to convince you."
He climbed to the window, and sat on the sill, listen-
ing attentively. Of course he heard nothing, or, at
.least nothing unusual, and" soon jumped down again.
He walked away from the place in silence; but there.
was an expression, half-sneering and half-pitying, on his
countenance, which cut me to the quick.
I now vowed to myself that I would solve, the diffi-
culty in the most direct manner. I would go to the
spot by night, alone, for nobody should laugh at me
more. How whist was I all that day! how preoccupied
wigly anticipated conflicts with goblins, witches, dwarfs,
dragons-what not!.
At the accustomed hour of my errands to the shop at
night, a little before nine, I proceeded resolutely to the
enchanted ground. I saw the white post.
"'Tis nothing but a white post," I said to myself,
:.cheerily.

"Such as spectres love," whispered Fear; "So much

The white post appeared and disappeared almost
momentarily. I came to within a rood and listened:
no sound whatever. I moved forward a step or two,
and heard the dismal clank. My heart began at once'
to throb. The moon, too, conspired' against me. She
fared out of a cloud with sudden brilliancy, and in her
light the post gleamed whitely, and the two eyes-
impossible to mistake two eys-,glared upon  e. I
remembered, though indistinctly, my mother's words.

advanced, the chain was again heard, with a quick,'
loud rattle, over the boards which composed tie side-
walk, and the post became converted into al s eleton

to afford him, but terrible to behold on my part. My

Guilford March was K tormented by delusions of
another sort.
Owing this steady ess of character and deliberation
of manner, my brother was patronized by lads older,

young gentleme acquaintances.

Whereupon, in the succeeding verses, the mother grants
consent, and Jimmy marries the accomplished, damsel
he loved and praises.
But 'independent of Dick' dog and his Blue-eyed
Stranger, there was an additional interest excited by
Dick in' the hearts of small boys at that time. The
Morgan excitement was running high, and Dick the
sheriff, on catching an urchin, always inquired-
Mason or Anti-mason ?"
and let the prisoner go free, or toted him off to the jail,
according to his reply. We youngsters long thought
Dick must be initiated in all the dreadful mysteries of
the secret order. And to this day, I remove my hat
reverently whenever I meet a man known to be a
Mason (or even Know Nothing), forDick's sake. That
lloth Abe and Dick were Shoepacs I never had the
least doubt, and I respect them accordingly.
A distinguished occasion once served to test the al il-
ity and courage of our champions. After .having man-
aged the schoolmasters since the beginning of time, as
proved by all accounts, both traditional and historical,
the boys of our quaint little antique city had imposed
upon them, at the hands 'of Archibald Magroy, L.D.
and other trustees, aY master who dared to assume the
reins- of government h itself. During the golden age
when Allen and John were little lads, the numbers of
ferules and birchen rods destroyed must have been
great. An 'occasion41 p'uiishmernt by violence was-
tolerated, but every abuse of the 'penal power was

resented, either secretly or openly, b the good ellows
of the school; and schoolmasters were taught, by  hole-
some experience, what those limits were, beyond which
they passed at their peril.,
The present worshipful chancello  of the ro, Mr.
Merciful Thrasher, chose, presumingly, to ma   the
jurisdiction of his own court of quit ; and such an in-
fraction of popular sovereignty was not to be tolerated.
Xl[r, Thrasher wad a gentleman of medium .height slen-
der figure, a 'decided' expression and manner, and much
pride of character. His first step was to take th  bull
by the horns, and thrash the largest youths. His bold-
ness overawed the little' Atheis, and they forthwith
began to conspire together to :undermine his throne ;
but by virtue of his spies, he outwitted them here" As
a measure of last resort, the aid of Abe and Dick their
allies, was demanded.
An innocent little fight between two lads-lullies
among their fellows-had been arranged and went off
nicely. The principals, accessories-before and after-
witnesses-in short all parties to this case, were br ought
to light, and on the following day were to be brought to
punishment. Now the time-honored right to pu   boy
against boy and raise a fight at a moment's notic had,
to say the least, been winked at by all persons in  utho-
rity-and here the oppressed parties determined to make
a stand for their ancient privileges.
A meeting was held by night in the school yard
The case is stated.

"Well," said A e, "what is he going to do ?"
"J shouldn't wo ider," replied one, ".if he flogged us
to-morrow from a o izzard."
" With what ?"
"He sent out this afternoon to the bush, and had a
dozen birch sticks out and brought in.
'e I'm of the opinion," quoth Dick, "that you'd better
al cut stick your elves-that is, come up missing to-
m rrow morning."
"That will only defer the matter till another day.
All Merciful takes his 'time. I never knew him to whip
a chapon the spur of the moment. He's as cool as a
cucumber."
" Then," said Diek, "suppose you all quit sch ol1?"
"Folks at home won't stand that."           /
" Then I gives it up."
Abe, however, as not of Dick's despairing humor.
"Where are those. rods ?" he asked.
"In the desk."
" Can you unlock it ?"
"No, we've tried all the keys in he town I believe,
every one of us brought all we could from home."
"Is the school-house door locked "
"Yes."
" Are the' windows fastened ?"
"No."
" Abe,' andDick, and several of the larger boys now
drew off a on~ side for consultation. On their return

little fellows were told they might as well go home-
which the most of us, myself among the number,
innocently did. It came to light afterwards that there
was a lurking suspicion in the breast of one o our
urchins, who ran straight to Mr. Thrasher's lodgings,'and
made know to the master everything that had been so
far said or done.
Shortly afterwards Abe and Dick, who had pretended
to go home, returned to the school-yard in company.
wit the boys, and proceeded to fulfill their intention.
The rods must be destroyed that night by some  eans
or other. At last it was thought best, for fear of etec-
tion, that the two champions only should have a h nd in
it, for there was as great a desire to outwit their  aster
as to escape the threatened flogging.
Accordingly the two worthies advanced to a window
and railed it. Abe climbed in. Dick remained outside
standing guard. The first thing heard from Abe  as an
exclamation of pain as his leg came in sharp c intact
with a bench.
Dick laughed, "Hope it wasn't you shin, old boy, he !
he!" .
Abe was next heard to utter something aboutu the
darkness of the room, and all was again silent.'
"Can't you find the desk ?" whispered Dick.
"No! I don't believe there ever was one here."
"Be quick !" said Dick ; "I hear a step.

This' enraged the honest Abraham, and twinin4 one
of his long arms around the schoolmaster, he grasped
the slender nan as if in a vice, and lifting him fro: the
ground, attempted to overthrow him by an effort of
main strength. But it seemed that Merciful was no poor
wrestler, and his agility put him on a level with Abe,
and a regular wrestling match ensued. Dick would
fain have aided his friend, but the latter ordered him off.
"Keep off, Dick, just see fair play !"
By this time a few of the boys had gathered around
the wrestlers. Great was their mingled awe, astonish-
ment, joy, and semi-regret, to behold the only master
they had ever feared. or respected wrestling on the grass
with Abe the ostler. At last Abe got his adversary
under, so as to hold him.
"Promise to do-nothing about it, Mr. Thrasher," laid
the boys' champion.
"Never !" gasped forth the schoolmaster from between
his teeth.
Two of the boys came forward and interceded for their
vanquished enemy.   But Abe vowed he would .hold
him down until morning, unless he promised: what was
required. Attempting at this moment to change his
hold, his adversary seized the instant, and nearly suc-
ceeded in turning Abe. The latter now called for Dick,
and by means of a combined effort they dragged the
discomflted- knight of the lirch to the door of the base-
ment story of the schoolhouse-their jail--and were

about to make hi prisoner,_ long enough, at least,:
them to secure their own escape,, when Mr. Thrasl
rendered the prom ise.
"Neither to say anything aboit this night, nor puni
any of the boys to-morrow ?"
"Neither !"
"Never flog any of then again?"
"Never !"
"Keep your word like a man $"
,     c"Yes!"
Abe and Dick let go,
"Gentlemen," said Merciful Thrasher, to those of h
scholars who were standing near, "I have taught school
in many places. This is my first defeat. I shall take
steamboat to-morrow morning for the West."
The boys handed him his cap in silence. He drew
over his brows, and strode homewards-the boys mab
ing way for him respectfully.
.Before .he reached his quarters, however, he wa
bvertaken by a committee of the lads, who attempted t
apologize through their spokesman.
"No sir ! no.sir ! No apologies."
They offered; in the nam  of the school, to make any
amends in their power..
"No sir. You were obli ed to call in foreign aid. I
will not trust any of you again. No atonement p ssi-
ble--no atonement."
His feelings, however, were touched by their kind-
ness and regret. He shook hands with them gratefully,

yet-proudly, requesting them to prevent the lads of the
school from going to the boat the next morning to see
him off. This was readily promised.
On the following morning the school met as usual.
Nothing was said of the incidents of the previous night
until the hour of the steamer's departure had gone by.
When the fact of the vacancy of the throne was
announced, three cheers were given for the dethroned
monarch, three times three for Abe and Dick. The
boys dispersed for their homes with the news, too good,
almost, to be true,-" No school! no school !"
The question of school discipline now became one of
grave importance with the city patriarchs and squires.
The interregnum lasted many months, no one being
forthcoming of sufficient' self-confidence to assume the
pedagogireins.
After great pains, and extensive inquiries over the
Eastern States, the place of Merciful Thrasher was
filled.
The name of this hardy adventurer was 9liphant, and
he was, an M.D. The boys called him   r, Oily Fat.
Boys are ingenious at nicknames; they frequently ex-
press contraries. So it was in this case, for Oily Fat
was as lean as Cassius, and never had krown the luxury
of fat in his life. But he was an athletic, sinewy man,
and combined knowledge with power bEyond precedent
or rivalry.
What his true history was, no one ever knew; for he
told such extraordinary things of himself, that no' one

true, for he appearedd equal 'to any emer ency. Th
doctor was a remarkable man every way. INis look wa
ludicrously frightful; he had straight standing blal
hair, black, eyes that "never fell before mortal o
immortal," so Oily Fat often declared emphatically
and immense whiskers. Those whiskers! I never sha1
forget them. One was black, the other a- fiery red
This is no-fiction. Did he not dye the red one eve y
month or two, and did he not, while the. process o
coloring was going on, wear a white kerchief around 1i
face, and say he had the tooth-ache,. when any little
innocent kindly inquired of "the doctor what, was the
matter?$
Doctor Oliphant's -appearance went a long way
his favor from the threshold. Then his course of pr-
ceedings was no less inspiring. God forgive him 'the
false words he spake, though doubtless for our good,
and in order to obtain that inuence necessary ovar
young minds, and the use of tlat ferule necessary o
young shoulders.
He had taught school in no .less than fifteen Staten.
This was not the first occasion he had been summonedI
to break in refractory schools. He had been sent for
frequ ntly from one end of the Union to the other for
precis ly this purpose. He never had any trouble but
twice. In Georgia, he was obliged to knock down ever

handcuffs and fetters.  And in Tennesse he did not
succeed in curbing the spirit of insubordination until he
introduced coffins, add laid pistols on the .t ble, coolly
remarking, that the frst mutineer should fil one of
those coffins..
His pathway to our-1hearts was no less hold and admi-
rable, though not so horribly picturesque. He' permit
ted little manifestations of insubordination on the part
of small boys to pass. The first victim was the largest
boy in school, and son of the greatest man in the city,
no less a dignitary than our newly-arrided Governor.
Thisyouth was a w    good fellow, the ringleader in all
mischief. On this occasion he declared the master
should not thrash a-certain one of the little fellows, as
the doctor was proceeding to administer one or two
light blows of his fertile on the hand of a winning;
whimpering urchin.

enacted before our eyes.  Suffice to say, the doctor

stand on the benches, on the desks, on the very stove,
and at each hesitation on the part of the victim, he
administered a "dose," as we always called his thwacks.
That bold punishment put an end to school-boy reign
in 'our city. Many fine points there w re, too, about
our terrible master.  His absolute sway was never
abused bit in the one instance recorded.- A poor boy,

an eloquent lecturer, and introduced an entire change
in studying, for although it had traditinally been voted
a bore to study-now it became a pleasure. He lec-
tured enthusiasticlly on arithmetic, the driest of sub-
jects, and performed beautiful experiments in chemistry
.-then a new science among us. So great was the inte-
rest in this study, that many scapegraces sat up all the
night, voluntarily, and laboriously burnished plates of
the now old-fashioned galvanic battery; with which he
performed such wonders!
Yes,; I believe, after all, that our good friend, 'Dr.
Oliphant was a gentleman and a scholar ; And if God
forgave,, or he himself believed, the ingenious fictions
which he palmed off upon 'our credulous young minds,
I have no doubt he died as a' Christian. God may
forgive a falsehood told .a child, but the child never
does. No matter what apparent necessity, or how good
soever the motive, when you come to detect the deceit,
and see that those who had the care. of you, imposed
upon you, trifled with your understanding, cheated,
deluded you, it lessens your confidence in the integit
of man, and violates the majesty of truth eternal in your
breast.

age. Then came a boy of twelve, and a flaxen-haired
limp of a girl of ten. The children seemed to regard
Guilford with the wonder of their mother, added to a

mutes, treating their city guest with an occasional stare.
The interior of our beautiful :'peninsula was but
thinly settled, and the country aroundFarner Jumps's
was almost a wilderness. His house was a mere cabin

ague, and held periodical prayer. meetings for the pio-

try cousins as a sort of superior race. This inly acknow-
ledged superiority,' however, the country lads are ever
ready to dispute.  To Guilford's knowledge, on the
occasion before us, these, farmer lads were soon ready to
defer, for the purpose of more fully extracting informa-
tion on sundry matters in which they stood in igno-
rance.
Accordingly Guilford interested them  deeply in his
accounts of caravans, circuses, militia-trainings, fire
engines, skates, schools, kites, tops;,jewsharps, and mar-
bles.  They were disappointed, however, to find he
knew so little about ginger-bread, a goodly array of
which, in bird-like, beast-like, man-like, and woman-
like forms, they had once seen in a shop window. There
had been a lurking disposition at first, on the part of
the young Jumpses, to humble my brother next day-
so Susannah afterwards revealed;-but his frankness,
and the satisfactory information he' gave, on the whole,
changed their intentions; and far from desiring now to
expose his ignorance of the various secrets of wood-
craft, they resolved to aid him all in their power to learn
farming. As for Suz, she was perfectly charmed, as
she told me long afterwards,, with his gentleness and
superior understanding. To her, Guilford was of a new
order of being, and at once she began to "slick up,"' as
she said.
Then bed-time came. Guilford had observed but one

bed, and wondered whether Jumps und 'his wife and
family and he were all to sleep in it. But Mrs. Jumps
soon solved that problem, by drawing from beneath the
bedstead a truckle bed large enough to 'hold the three
boys ; and a couchi was* made for Susannah on a long
blue chest-which, by the way, had probably held their
worldly 'goods and chattels when they emigrated from
Vermont.
Mr. Jumps being the last to retire, lew out the light,
that is to say, covered up the fire, lea ing the hearth in
sole possession of a speckled cat, and a pan of buck-
wheat batter, placed there to "rise" fo breakfast. But
no sooner did silence prevail in the loghouse, than Gu-
ford heard a long 'dismal howl, that arose from the
woods in the midst of which they lay. Soon came
another, longer, and mingled with fellow-howls, each
one seeming to draw nigher and nigh i to the door, till
at length it seemed to be besieged with a roar of dismal
howlings-.
Guilford drew the coverlid over~ is head ; but his
bed-fellows only laughed at his fears. Ashamed of
betraying himself in such wise to these country bump-
kins, he uncovered his head.. A perf et blast of roars
and threats, mingled with whines and screeches of dis-
appointed yet greedy rage saluted his ears.
" What is it ?"' demanded he ini a whisper.
"aNothing but wolves.. Go to sleep."
" How do you like country music, boy ?" asked Mr5.
Junips, with a coarse laugh-.

Mr. Jumps interposed now, and soothed the alarm of
ailford by telling him that the animals were of a small,
rmless  ort, and though they had howled, apparently,

they shouted over the oxen.
When dinner-time came, Dame Jumps. appeared in
the angel avocation of blowing a trumpet-that is to
say sounding a long tin horn. She showed herself at
the corner of the cabin, and with the instrument applied
to her mouth with one hand, while the other arm she
held akimbo at her side to assist in the mighty effort,
she brayed forth a Jericho-shaking blast. .There was no
resisting this call, it said in Mrs. Jumps's most decided
manner:
"Dinner's ready, and waits for no man."
Guilford was hungry and ate heartily. He deserved
some reward for his plight. His hands were scratched,
his face blackened, and his eyes filled up with cinders.
Suz expressed her sympathy by bringing a tin wash-basin,
and water-none of the cleanest-from a spring near by
the house, distilling through the black vegetable mould
into a barrel which was half alive with insects, while
occasionally, a lingering frog who had chine up to sun
his body out of the torpor of an October day, plumped
himself down with a splash as you approached.
After dinner the party betook themselves to the clear-
ing again, where they worked away till near nightfall,
when Toby and Guilford were again dis atched for the
cows ; no trifling errand, as the animals wandered far
during the day--=water in the woods being pletyand

ain't so tarnal easy. A man ought to have a turn for it,
with a constitution like a horse. He mast work like a

" Yes sir," said Guilford-who knew  lready that "to
adopt a course," was the Jumps philosophy-his panacea
for every ill. Jumps rarely condescends to explain
himself after uttering this indiputable dogma. And so
now, ho arose, entered the house to rekindle his pipe,
and rea peared with a live coal, which e shifted rapid
ly from his right hand to his left, and as swiftly froi4
his left hand to his right, vainly endeav ring to plant il
in the bowl. The refractory coal dropped on the floor.
Jumps took the tongs to it.
"Yes!" resumed the smoking philosopher, "a man
may think hie knows all about fearing an get his fingers
burnt-after all. Now if it weren't fo fear of going
through the woods like an over particular gal, and taking

At this moment Joram broke in.
"Dad, don't you think Pd make a s art minister of

Mri Jumps, senior, did not reply. He rose up hastily,

reference to the last complaint, we may as well antici-.
pate a few year, and state, that notwithstanding this,
melancholy list of grievances, the 9umpses continued to
exist, nay, to thrive, from year to year, ti11, as we shall
see, in due time, they had the best farm in the county,
and the Jumpses became one of the "first families."
Guilford observed this very satisfactory account,
which it gave them such evident delight to draw, and
thought that as it is only necessary to see an evil in
order to avoid falling into it ourselves, he himself would'
do better; therefore, he continued to hol4 on steadily to
his course.
But Mr. Jumps seemed to take a pecul ar pleasure in
making Guilford March work.
"You have adopted a course, my lit le fellow," he
would say, "and you must stick to it through thick and
thin."
Accordingly, there was little peace  r rest for the
poor boy, until night came. He began t fancy himself
growing dull, like Joram and Toby. Th  thought hor-
rified him ; yet' all the boys he saw were of the same
species. " All work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy," sure enough, thought he.
There were a hundred people in the vicinity-tw9

The word, "conscience" pointed Maud Ato the diff-
cult, narrow way, the straight road. She went forth
from her morning prayers, next day, sadder, yet calmer.
Allen Magroy met her as usual on the path to
school.
The accustomed greetings were exchanged-perhaps,
on the side lof .Maud, with even Mnore' than the accus-
tomed warmth. 'There was a sorrowlful ardor in her
looks, whenever she turned them  upon   the proud-
bearing young gallant at her side. Even suffering had
not deprived Allen of his dashing ease of manner ; and
fine address is not lost on woman --'tis -no little of the
divinity she attributes to her hero.  Allen wore his
hair long, as was the manner of the day; hisblack
locks were worthy a knight of romance'; he had, more-
over, made a vow-silly fellow !-on le ving the pater-
nal mansion, with the world before him; not to shear
his hair until his father, proud of his success, should
forgive him. That was a rash, boyish vow; and in the
clearer light of a letter reason, his long hair hung
around him, a real covering of humility. As the two
walked over the green grass now, a stranger might
point to them and exclaim-
" There go t le pride and beauty of the village ?"
Strangers would call our little city a village.

grey hairs in sorrow to the grave,  sir !"
Each sentence of this affectionate address was empha-
sized by Mr. Magroy's cane-ferule on the floor.
For such an outbreak the young man was not pre-
pared. A hope had suddenly, violently, been cru hed
It was with difficulty he could speak.
"Father, I would not reproach you; but what ever
can account for this misunderstanding?"
"Misunderstanding I" echoed the old gentleman, say
agely.
"What can account for it ?" continued Allen, "but a
want of knowledge an absence of sympathy between
your heart and mine ? Could Iabut hope to clear up this
cloud, could I but dare to unfold my views, my heart,
my wishes my whole being, changed, though trampled
upon as I have been, I would thank, oh!1 how I woui4
thank, the grat, good God!"
Allen's hands wire clasped together ; his look:was
agony.
"God knows! G d knows," he cried tenderly, "I
would not embitter your earthly days."
" Then, sir," spoke Mr. Magroy, softly,' you have:

IT was a night of more than ordinary cheerfulness.
The return of Guilford on the previous evening lent an
additional brightness to the ruddy glow of the library
fire. A knock was heard at the front door. Bowes came
in with a letter, which she said, looking away, was for
Maud. Allen Magrdy had left it, without any message.
Maud blushed and turned quite pale, as Mrs. March
handed the letter to her daughter.
" Perhaps you would like to read'it alone, my child ?"
Maud retired, taking a light.
She was not gone a moment, but returned, and handed,
the opened letter to her mother.    It was as follows:
"DEAR MAUD,
"You must, you will pardon me for writing, when you learn
what. I have to communica te. My father visited me this afternoon. I
will not particularize what took place ; but in going away he used
threatening language con erning your mother's family. He never

"ALLEN MAGRoY."

This epistle of course threw us into some consterna
tion.  Mrs. Marc   alone maintained hli; tcalmness
Mabel declared that Mr. Magroy meant to burn the
house down, and  oud were her lamentations that :he
father was not at home. to rescue us from. destruction
M: Latrobe had gone to New York, with the expectation
of sailing for Lou on on business for the company, an
probably had left re this. Maud was silent, and pale.
Guilford said he saw no way in which Mr. Magro
could injure us.
We are in a f ee country, and the law will protect
us, mother."
Guilford thought highly of the power and justice of
the law, on accour t of the experience he had enjoyed
in witnessing a cas in court, already hinted at in John
March's letter. -Mrs. March thought some terrible
calamity might -be impending over the head of her
daughter, the inno ent cause of the unfortunate quarrel
between father and son; but she wisely kept her ow
counsel. At this onjuncture in our affairs how tear-
fully the widow t4 ought of her husband, their natural
protector. But w s he not watching, and was there
not a yet more powerful friend, even the widow's God?
At last Mrs. March spoke.,
"Whatever this danger may be, my-children, I feel

assured in my own heart that God will provide a way
of escape."
She took down thle family Bible, and read the 91st
Psalm. With what sweet hope and gentle reassurance
the family arose after evening worship and retired to
their beds!
Such is Religion's oothing balm.
The period for t e third annual payment on the
house was now rapidly, approaching. We had not found
our creditor a hard man.. The day had passed by in
both previous years without the money being demanded,
and Mrs. March had been allowed to take her own time.
This year was a difi ult one for householders, provisions
were never known o high, and the number of our
boarders (our only pecuniary resource) had diminished.
Mrs. March expected daily to hear some dread news on
account of the warning Allen had given. But it seemed
as if either the youth was mistaken, or that his father
had changed his humor, for weeks passed without
calamity, and the fear of it at first so appalling, gradu-
ally died away. Meantinewe were all making strenu-
ous efforts to increase the list of our boarders, to reduce
still more our slender expenses, and by careful economy
to lay up money for the payment. The event, however,
seemed doubtful, The times grew harder, and we were
drawing on what had already been  sated and laid by.
The first day of the last quarter came, and with it
another note from Allen:

"DvAi MAUD:
"Ihave just learned from Mr. Floury that my father has pur-
chased the remaining unpaid portion on the bill of sale of your mother's
house. What his object may be I dare not conjecture. Pardon me for
presuming to advise, that if Mrs. March only meets the payments
promptly, as they fall' duethere can be no trouble. Hoping I am not
destined to be the herald of further exciting news, I remain
"1ALI4EN MAGROY.".
This was 'frightful enough, yet Mrs. March, while not
de pairing of making the next payment. in time, felt
so e relief in the fact that-Mr. Magroy seemed to direct
his-malice against her rather 'than Maud.
" After all," she said, "'it may be a mere matter of,
business between Mr. Articles and Mr. Magroy."      The
former was the gentleman in whose hands the property
had fallen at my father's decease, and from whom Mrs.
March had made the purchase.
Every sinew was now strained to meet the app -oach-
ing liability.  With no little reluctance on the part of
Mrs. March, Maud, Guilford, and myself were with-
drawn from our schools to save the expense of tuition.
Mabel declared she would not go either, but insisted
'on reciting, to Maud, and turning her school expenses
into the family fund.  It was to no purposethat we all
protested. Mabel would have her way. And Maud
became our instructress for the nonce.
Payment day came. It seemed to my imaginative
soul that we were on the eve of some grand catastrophe,
that the world was to be in some sudden manner

chang d, to us at least, for I knew very well that the
filthy lucre was not forthcoming., And to think of'
Mr. Magroy! I 'epresented him to Mabel as a bloody-
minded Shylock.' After breakfast my mother went
down the avenue. She did not return till the dinner
hour.- It was easy to see ,that she was disappointed.
Her excellent old friend Casher Coiner could have
helped her to ten times the amount at any other time,
but now the- year was just closing, and the bank
directors had given orders that not a dollar should be
discounted until they saw how the affairs of the institu-
tion stood, and whether it would be likely to weather
the currency storm just beginning to rage ovei- the
country. She had applied to several of her friends
among the merchants, but with little better suc-
cess.
In the afternoon she put on her widows' cap, black
bonnet and shawl, and neat plain collar, and again
went opt. Soon reaching the house of 4r. Magroy the
tremulously raised the brass knocker at the door. Dame
Polly Fidgets appeared, dressed in silk.
"Isoytr master at home, Mrs. Fidgets ?"
"Pd like to know who you call my master, mam.
I'm as dgod'as'any wash"
"I beg your pardon.- Is Mr. Magroy at home ?"
"Well, I'llsee," said the ruffled hen partridge, smooth-
ing her feathers-with an ill grace.
Mrs. March was left standing on the door-sill, whil
the dame was gone. Her heart palpitated violently,

and in spite of herself already augured an unfavorable
termination to her. mission.
"This way, ma'am. Mr. Magroy will see you in his
office."
"Have you come On business, ma'am p" My mother
made no reply.
Worthy Dame Fidgets did, not leave the door which
opened from the house into the office, but anxious for
her prospects, and fearful that a reconciliation might be
effected between her master and the Marches, and
thereby lead to the return of the disinherited son, she
applied her ear to the keyhole.
"You wish to see me, madam," growled the deep
voice of the entlemanly proprietor of the mansion, who,
from some u known cause did not raise his face towards
the lady.,
"Yes, sir," said my mother, summoning all the com-
posure she could command.
"There is a chair," spoke again the voice.
Mrs. March sat down, or rather sank down, in silence,
which she at length interrupted with difficulty.
"Mr. Magroy, there has begin some trouble between
yourself and Allen, in which, by some.,  itentional
circumstance or act perhaps of"-   Mr.  fagioy sud--

" Is this your business, madam ?"
Such rudeness in his speech ! his looks! his whole

"No, sir !" said she rising with dignity and coloring
highly. "It was my desire to remove any misunder-

threshold I will bid that intention go, as best it may,
conscious, sir, of the innocence of'me and of mine."
"Oh yes, Mrs. March, neither you nor your fair

I' No gentleman-no one but a coward, sir ! would

"Do you come to beard me, woman?" he yelled forth
with such frenzy as to shake the door at which Mrs.
Fidget's ear.waspinned, so as to shale that honest
woman from head.to foot-but with delight at the
cheering course of events,
A retort rose to the tongue of my mother, but she
remembered the cry of the little ravens in the home
nest, and she shrank back likewise from the vulgar war
of words, so suddenly and unexpectedly raised. She
had   pected no such reception, and with bitterness she
remembered that this same insolent man had been
under no small obligation to her husband in their early
business life. - Nay, more, she might h ve recalled the
time, further back, when the young Scot conferred
upon her the honor of his :marked attentions. All this
flashed through her oppressed and out aged soul, and
left an almost lightning scathe. ,Then s e remembered~

the words of the Psalmist, "I will rebuke kings for thy
sake," and quietly resolved to leave the widow's cause
with the widow's God.
She advanced to the table at which Mr. Magroy was
sitting, and laid upon it a package of money.
"Payment on the house, hem! Let me see," said he,
"how much is due;" The dissen bler! had he not been
feasting his eye on the little note ;all day.
Three hundred dollars !"
My mother kept silence as he then proceeded to count
the bills.
" Here are but two hundred."
"Yes sir ! I thought that if convenient to you"-my
poor mother paused. To beg any favor of this creature
was too humiliating. Then she-endeavored to look upon
it as a matter of business and went on, under the scowl
of her creditor.
"If 'as convenient to you, sir, a few days delay would
I think enable me to procure the remaining hundred
dollars."
"Possibly your expected son-in-law, that penniless
scapegrace of mine, might assist you," he said sarcastic-
ally.
My mother bit her lips till the blood flowed. At
length she was able to reply calmly.

day, perhaps on this earth, the vileness of your calumni-

triumph, I fear you not. No," she added murmuringly,
"I fear not what man can do."
Mrs. March's calmness had by this time excited the
iiflammable character before her, even s oil the burning
tow.
"What the devil has got into all of them ?" he cried
jumping upon the floor, and stamping  ercely with his
foot and striking his cane. "My villainous son and this
washerwoman preach to me ! yes, a  oman preach to
me! .Is that the way you converted him? caused him
to raise his arm against his indulgent father? drove him
away from the fire-side of home; filled his head with

madam, you contaminate a once happy home with your

"When you have endorsed the amount of that pack-

for my mother's exit by the door at. which she was
admitted.
Mrs. arch passed through the little orchard fronting
the offie, ant turned her steps towards  e business
portion of tIe city. .It was past banking  ours, and
most of the merchants had either deposited in the banks
or locke away their specie for safe keeping; so that it
was no easy matter to exchange the bills for the legal
tender u on which Mr. Magroy insisted. She succeeded
in exchanging a part, however, but as for borrowing the
additionI hundred dollars that was entirely out of the
question on that day. She remembered that the law
allowed her until twelve at night to make the payment,
and so went heavily homeward. As she walked down
the little lawn in front of the dear old mansion that
looked n w like a blessing brightening as,"if on the eve
of flight, she was almost thrilled at 'the laud cheery
notes of  robin perched on top of a leaflesslilac bush.
A momentary gleam of hope seemed to quicken heiy
steps at the sound.
"That robin wouldn't sing o if the little han Is

This venerable building; now no more, deserves a
passing word, as it dated back to the most primitive
times of the white men on that frontier. Here the
chiefs of the tribes gravely smoked Ka-nic-a-nic--or
Indian tobacco of the North, prepared from the bark of
the red willow-with the governor of the town and the
ghostly: Jesuit Fathers. The odor of ka-nic-a-nic still
clung to its walls. There seemed yet to be a sort of
Indian summer reigning in its atmosphere, as the light

learning and $irtue in the welfare of a state. The
learned and witty Counsellor O'IMar, with his drollery,
and mixture of pathos and ridicule, has just sat down
beneath the roars and shouts of the meeting.
Allen rises, to answer him on thepside of virtue. . You
wonder at his temerity. His face is crimsoned with
genuine modesty.   He alludes deferentially to the
superior judgment and greater experience of his prede-
cessor, and pays a compliment to his art and learning.
Before proceeding to unfold .his own argument, h
attacks the weak points of his adversary; and in less
than five minutes, you are quietly astonished at the
ridiculousness of the Irish counsellor's position, deemed
.a moment ago impregnable. But you console your-
self with the general absurdity of Irish blarney, and
.are not yet ready to give the stripling before you credit
for overthrowing them.. He now proceeds to state the
question on his own side,. Where did the.ouce indo
lent idler get hold of this principle ? where pick up
that fact?2 Now he warms into the argument; his body
seems to dilateinto the ample proportions of a man; he
-stands ia head talley than before ; he waves his- hand
with a new grace; his eyes beam with a now fire; you.
watch them with intense interest; they seem fairly to
light up the hall,. ith s dusky galleries.  Men lean
over on the backs ff the benches in front of theme; a

his great, burning eye-balls shone only on Maud. The
question is carried Eby acclamation in, favor of virtue.
The meeting breaks up, and everybody shakes the hand
of Allen Magroy-everybody save one. Yet their eyes
have met, and in that one look is Allen's chief laurel.
How cruel that destiny seemed, which, like an impas-
sable abyss divided those great twin hearts.' There
the       like two tall cliffs, asunder, with their sun-
lit faces fixed, the one upon the other, in steady con-
stancy, sublime to contemplate.
Time, the river at their feet, rolled down many a
golden sand for others,-yet brought no happiness for
them.
The scrupulous Maud pursued her conscientious path,
and, so far as outward sign might show, was no more to
Allen Magroy than other gentle maidens of the city.
Thus years flowed wearily away.  The river was
widening towards the ocean.
Meanwhile' Allen passed the bar, and Mr. Floury
took the eloquent young advocate into partnership.
Allen mingled with society; he often met Maud; she
was generally attended by the devoted Major Fontenoy,
who lived only in the light of her smiles.

As for nkyseWthe memory of my father is yet green
in my heart. My love for him is the little shining river.
meandering  through my days, and on its banks are
clustered the fair flowers of beauty and the rich fruits
of love. -I am not sure that my poetical efforts do not
date back as far as this period..
It was 'a melancholy happiness to take Mabel with
me Sunday afternoons with baskets of flowers, which we
braided, and laid all over his grave. Sometimes my
mother went with us, and looked on with an ab'stracted
air, while we twined garlands, over the sorrel, which
like little crosses waved amid the grasses as the gentle
south wind swept along. On one occasion a tall elderly
man, a stranger, who said he came all the way from
Nova Scotia, accompanied my mother to the church-
yard' andtfey two knelt down together and wept. He
did notnake himself known to us, but only said :
"He was my friend, where is his grave?"
This person may have been once a fur trader.
My wanderings in the woods formed an ever fresh
source of pleasing ruminations  iere I led a life all
iny own. The noise of the school, the sports of merry
companions,;and the pleasures of home, where !y,
mother and Mael were-and yet1 hereicare thoug

Mrs. March to send me to West Point. This gentleman
seemed so delighted with his elevation, that like the clown
in the farce, he stood re dy to marry all the widows, and
father all the children a ongst his constituents. In fact
this virtuous politician gave out significantly-before
election-that his reign should be known as the para-
disaical period for such poor folk; that Widow March's
son should go to WestIPoint, and the son of another
widow should have a mdshipman's warrant ; he would
fill the post-office with indigent blind persons, and the
custom-house with deaf and dumb. Our worthy friend
and patron had lately visited the East, where he had
been conspicuous in th assemblages of public philan-
tlutopists.
My application was d awn up in due form by Major
Fontenoy, himself a   ilitary graduate. The newly
elected member, Hon. liver Hazzard Perry Hustings,
took the paper with ma y recommendations accompany-
ing it, to the seat of go ernment. We heard no more
of the matter until the i eturn of Mr. Hustings, who told
us with evident pain he had not been able to secure the
appointment, but that had the application been for a
midshipman's berth he could have got it. My friend
the navy candidate, h wever, fared no better. Mr.
Hustings told him it wa a pity he had not applied for

the edge of his person on the corner of the lounge,
while Mr. 4umps senior made himself quite easy and
comfortable at once in the arm-cha r-as any squire,
should. Trunk and baskets were left in the hall. Re-
assured by 'his father's confidence o manner,' Joram
gradually gained ground on the lounge, till he felt him-
self sufficiently secure to lean back, as imitative of his
father as the back of the lounge permitted.
"Picture of the old man, s'pose?" said Squire Jumps,
pointing towards the portrait of Mr. March.

presided over Joram's face, was a capricious painter-
capricious even for a painter, nay, even for a woman-
and had drawn that part of the picture intended for the
foreground of this human firm divine, all perspective.
Nature and true art always go together ; and Joram's
shirt-maker had heightened the view of this perspective
by the altitude of the advan ed points of Joram's collar,
which was starched stiff witlal, and feld Joram's jaws
so straight to the front, at d his neck so immovably
erect, that you wondered whether Joram   was not
afflicted with one of Job's comforters on the neck.
"I have brought you a little garden sarse, Widow
March, not knowing how's you mightn't be pestered in
the city to get fresh vegetables."
Joram, by a stupendous efort, turned his erect person
towards the open hall-door, through which the'baskets
were visible, and caught an indistinct view, I dare say,
of the edge) of the greater basket.
"You ark very, very good, Mr. Jumps."
"Folks always calls him squire to home !" was heard
from the far end of the railway tunnel, in a nasal twang.
"Keep your peace, Joram'!" sternly ordered his
indignant sire.
"Wall, as you're justice pace, s'pose I must." These
sounds, I must not forget to say, issued from the tunnel;
but Joram's cheeks, and   hin, and collar, were as
immovable as the rock through which railway tunnels
are usually pierced.

Farmer Jumps had kept up a friendly intercourse
with us, ever since the Guilfcrd affair, concerning which
he often laughed loudly.
"Your mother's the woman for the money," said
Jumps. "She knows how to adopt a course. Now if
she'd said 'no l' and kept your brother back from
goin ontc  a farm, he'd never have been satisfied, and
might at last have run away and gone aut West, and

"'Don't spare my son a little labor, Mr. Jumps, let
him have his heart's content. He won't bother you

"'Trust me for that,' said I, catching her idea in a

care on his health,' 'says she, but just show him what
farming truly is.'

while, but by and by grew tired ad wanted to come
out. 'But no, boys,' says I, 'you love the crittur-just
you stay where you are till you are s tisfied.'
" I guess I kept 'em in with nothi g but their meals
for four days and nights, and they ha n't touched a card
since."
"Never will!" muttered Joram distautly.
This conversation took place at the Jumpses, when I
was sent there to rusticate after  y love freak with
Dulcinea. The family were living quite comfortably in
a new house built of hewn logs. The neighborhood was
settled more thickly. The O'Gradys had been riven
out by the intolerable force of public opinion, the
American civilizer ; the school-hous was standing on
the road-side at a mile's distance front the Jumps estate,
and here prayer meetings were held  eekly, and dhool
in the winter time.
Little as we may commend the r mutation of rustic
schools in that country, and at that di  twilight period,
this we may say-the prayer meet ngs were unique.
Far be it from us to speak irreverent y, much les with
ridicule, of those private assemblages f the good. The
rude attempts at religious services on the part of those
benighted pioneers, may perchance bear more gl rious
testimony at the judgment seat than the more refined
and sumptuous worship, vacantly and wth wan ering
eyes, conned over in velvet pews, and chanted from the
throats of gilded organs, or trilled with  peratic ffect
by hired musicians. In the East, goo honest sou s are

hired tc mourn for the dead. Why may not we employ
proxies to sing for the living? 'Tis doubtless sweeter, in
the eats of cherubim and seraphim on high, to hear
the well tuned voices of professional sweet singers, than
the inlarmonious concourse of rude utterances from a
promiscuous congregation of saints 'and sinners.
Mew me my good pussy cat. Coo me my soft turtle
dove-I'll fain do rny own roaring in the streets.
And since we have descended to the animal creation,
it behoves us to speak at once of certain young crows,
or gentlemen of the cloth, as they are softly denominat-
ed, from a certain Theological Seminary not many
leagues distant from that State in our grand confederacy
where swine are wont to be fed. In the woods, through
which they disseminated their doctrines, and quartered
themselves on the simple farmer folk, they were known
as perfectionists. The incumbent of the Green Run circuit
was the Rev. Mr. Milkwhite. On the occasion of my
attending "meeting" in the little log school-house by
the road-side, this gentleman, a youthful prophet, sat
behind a little pine table, serving the purposes of pulpit
and desk, with his eyes of milky blue raised, or rather
,voluminously rolled, up to the ceiling. It was after the
regular morning service-a special gathering of the
Just, making or already made perfect. Here sat on low
wooden benches a few of the choice spiritual dames and
fathers of the Church Militant, settled in the neighbor-
hood of Green Iun. As it did not seem to be expected
or desired that sinners would be present, it was with no

little difficulty I had prevailed upon Joram and +obias
to remain with me. In the brief interval between the
two meetings they pointed out the parties assembled,
and gave me their names, with a glimpse here and there
of their characters. I found they .' to be chiefly tbje ter-
magant wives and hen-pecked husbands of the township,
with an honest exceptional old grey headed saint-- eady
to worship God with sheep or goat.
To my own discredit be it acknowledged, that Walter
March was there from motives of idle curiosity.
"Brother Pipelegs will lead the meeting in prayer,"
quoth the Rev. Mr. Milkwhite, lowering his eyes
towards the side of the house occupied by the female
benches, but raising his mortal incumbrance of a  ody,
turning with a heavenly sigh, and kneeling down with
much devout emotion-in short, a groan.
Brother Pipelegs' prayer was not very edifying. fie
had become familiar to the ears of the neighborhood,
at Jumps's and elsewhere, for years. But he was fol-
lowed by young Milkwhite himself. Oh! what a happy
season: those excited hearts leaped foi- joy; their joy-
ful groans, their shouts of Hosannah ! Amen! come
Quickly! Jordan ! and Canaan.! were heard far through
the green old cloistered woods. Yet I, who had not
long since passed through some excitement-not such
as this, however--in a religious way, God forgive nzy
shortcomings-I was- hot completely overcome, but
wondered at the manifest discrepancy between natural
cause and supernatural effect, for Mr. Milkwhite yvas

not in my worldly eyes an exciting young man, but a
feeble, rather, I thought. Be that as it might, here was
the emotion of a host under the thunder claps of a
Wickliffe.
Amid the rapid rustling of palm leaf and turkey tail
fans, a hymn was thin sung to the tune of Peter Street,
for the refreshment of those devotees.
Rev. Mr. MilkwI ite's eyes were no longer on the
ceiling. Doubtless the dove for which he had been
looking had come dwn. And that 4ove, it appeared
to my sinful mind, Mr. Milkwhite found rustling amid
the muslins of the good dames before him, for there
were his eyes now also, during the singing of one of
Watt's beautiful hymng.
Brother Peppergrass was then called on for a prayer,
and the meeting knelt again.
Mrs. Peppergras wvas deeply moved ; her sighs
choked into gasps, her gasps grew into sobs, her sobs
fell into tears, her tears dried into moans, and Mr. Milk-
white noiselessly arose to comfort the afflicted dame.
He knelt down by her side and softly placed his arm
around that buxom waist, while with the hand of the
other arm he tenderly brought the cheek of Mrs. Pep-
pergrass on his own houlder. In this heart-moving,
this comforting position, he gently consoled the afflicted
Mrs. Peppergrass ith the words of hope and joy, till
Mr. Peppergrass ceased praying.
"Will Brother Dandelamb pray ?"

tribulation, to that lately betrayed by the now calm
Mrs. Peppergrass, and Mr. Milkwhite vouchsafed a no
less touching condolence.
"The meeting will now," he said, as Mr. Dandelamb
closed his hearty, honest, simple appeal, "the meeting
will now have a season of silent prayer."
And the benevolent Mr. Milkwhite moved like an
angel of mercy from man to man, and from wo an to
woman, to comfort and relieve the o'erfraught  eart.
How gently he laid his hand-a hand of pearl-o1 the
shoulder of each distressed brother!  How tenderly
he communed closely, face against face, with each
sad sister !  A  chapter in the New Testament was
then read. The attention given would be a mild
reproach to any city auditory, it was almost ieath-
less-except from the halm leaf and turkey tail fans.
At length the readbir, with much emphasis, came to
the words-" Be ye perfect."  No sooner was "per ect"
uttered, than prone upon the floor fell three sisters and
one brother, and so far as I could see, they were al in a
swoon. There was some slight spasmodic action here
and there, but in another moment, they all four lay pale
and motionless.
To my astonishment, this did not frighten Mr. ilk-
white.

people could sustain themselves, was too freely gran edi

"Ah,    alter, you are slandering me ungallantly,"

But then, how Mabel would ridicule everybody and
everything. No one knew it except we at home. In
truth, nobody knewM Mabel at all. No one thought that
such a quiet child could be the life of the house: no
one dreamed that she chirped and sang from daylight
to midnight: no one knew that she could dance on her
tip-toes, jump over chairs and a-top of tables, and per-
form all the tricks of the gymnasium.
So you perceive what a nondescript I have to
describe, for nobody either knew anything or would
believe anything about her. They thought her prudent,
believed in her, confided in her, trusted in' her, and she
was true to them all, and laughed at them all, and loved
them all-but alas ! not as all would have her love
them!
Thus she grew up a little charming Sphinx, a riddle
to us all, and. a fairy delight.  Mabel was quite
independent in her notions ; neither Maud nor even her
father could judge for her, and she believed in them to
the skies, too; yet she had a sharp, joyous, innocent
way of seeing and judging 'for herself, that, .I must
confess, though her conclusions were often at war with
my own, amused me beyond measure.

I wish I could have reduced Mabel to
love for me. She was as capricious as

eyes-that's as far as Mabel ever went i

Joram often stumbled over objects in the dark hall
going, to bed, when the lights were all extinguished,
accidentally, of course. Joram sometimes complained
that Mrs. Bowes had made his bed in a very uncommon
manner. Joram found notes in the post-office from
young damsels dying for him.    But Joram   always
brought these oft missives straight to Mabel, and to
please her in a lelcate way, would cut them to pieces
with his jack-knife and throw them on the fire in her
presence. He never to this day has suspected. Mabel

Joram was not destitute of'-natural ability. He pro-

it, we all know it, and Mabel is the only one that does
not seem to enjoy it after all. Mabel grows grave, alas,
has she lost her heart likewise ? No, Mabel is really too
good to enjoy any one's misery, and Joram is evidently
in tribulation. Yet the son of stout Farmer Jumps is
no weak dangler, no persecuting step-slave. Joram is
independent in his feelings.

CHAPTER XX.
A DENOUEMENT.

RE A DER, had you ever a friend for whom you felt '
degree of responsibility "in certain circles ?"' If so was
not your friend sure to commit'all his fai pas, say all
his silliest things, do his most awkward and extraordi-
nary deeds in that very certainn circleP"
Major Fontenoy was always my beau ideal of the
gentleman. The point was disputed by Mabel, who
preferred Allen, and by Guilfotd, who was tbo matter-
of-fact to enjoy the Major's sentimentality.
Even Maud smiled at hini. Walter felt responsible
for his friend, and thought the apparent excess of senti-
ment, nothing worse than a  flowering of the Major's
exquisite nature.
"iNor," said I, " is he sentimental on all occasions ; it
is here, in this house, beneath the eyes of Maud  arch,
that my dear old friend appears toso poor advantage.",
But with all reasonings and all efforts on my part, the
good Major never seemed to do himself justice at Lilac
Cottage. In all other places the gallant soldier cap-
tivated right and left.
We were sitting one evening after a summer rain,

upon the porch, enjoying the fresh fragrance of the
earth, and the awakened perfume of the flowers, when
Major Fontenoy came up the lawn.     He advanced
towards us in a sprightly manner-a little too sprightly
for his years-th hypercritical label thought. This
peculiarity was noticed afar.
"See !" said Guilford, smiling, " I suppose Walter
would term that, ' graceful motion.' "
"No," replied Walter "the major never will be
graceful,. oi in any way himself, when Maid is within
view."I
I went forward to meet him.
"How lovely the evening after a shower, hey !" said
my friend, as he drew near the ladies, and lifted his cap
handsomely.
"Yes, major," replied Mrs. March, " will you walk up
and join us ? we are all out enjoying the freshness."
"It is as sweet" he said taking a seat, "as the breath
of cattle on the lea, hey Walter? your friend old
Brindle, hey !"
The breath of cattle is .charming, yet altogether the
comparison did not quite suit-some people are so fas-
tidious. I warmly replied, "Yes sir," with a smile of
appreciation.
"What has the fair lady Maud- been doiiig to-day?
Sitting in her bower, hey !"
"Yes, major, if' by bower you mean my school."
Maud was innocent of offence, yet the major blushed,
swing how inapropos was this 'second comparison.

"Temple, I might say with more propriety, hey I
sweet oddess, hey!"
N ,no !" saidK[aud laughing, "I should rather say
plain ld school-house."
She stepped down the porch, plucked a sweet pea
blosso n, and handed it to Major Fontenoy.
The old gentleman joined the laugh, w ith his heart
full of simple ready glee. Then he grew silent. It was
only i i Maud's presence the agreeable talker ever was
silent.
Gui ford then spoke of meeting a soldier of the garri-
son, wh o told him slily he had got on the sick list by
playin old soldier with the surgeon, and came down in
town o have his fun.
The major had an anecdote ready in a moment.
"O course you allremember Surgeon Prim, stationed
here a few years ago, hey ! Well, a. soldier came into
the dispensary one morning with his tongue whitened
with  alk, hey. Doctor asked him what's the matter?$
'Feve, sir,' hey! touching his hat, hey! 'How do

The major dropped   pon liis knees. He took the

love.

Maud struggled in bewilderment.
"Beautiful ! lovely! angel ! Maud, hey! My heart

MILLBRoGK.
OuR path towards the bush went by a beautiful farm
through which ran a winding rivulet, overlooked by a
little green bank near the roadside. In the string time
this bank was carpeted with a multitude of wild flow-
ers, dandelions, aster flowers, violets, and 'anemones. It
was canopied overhead by the profuse. branches of a
grove of young butternut trees, up and along which
the fox grape climbed and trailed its vines, forcing many
a graceful festoon.
Here it was often our delight to pause as  e strolled
out on pleasant Sunday afternoons after old Brindle-.
Guilford could not leave his business on week-days. To
sit or lie here on the grass and build air-castls, each in
his own way, was for years our romance and light.
"Come, Walter," said Guilford on one of these
memorable times, as we lay extended at f11 length,
with straw hats covering our faces from the sun, "come!
let your kite fly !"
It was no sooner suggested, than Fancy took wing.
Away it soared into regions of love, religion and poetry,
changing almost momentarily, with capricious humor.

"Large enough for a library ?" I cried.
"Yes, with you over here I would be the happiest

"But Maud and Mabel-what's to become of them?"
"Mabel!" my brother Guilford uttered abstractedly.
"Yes Maud and Mabel," I repeated.
"Oh ! I'd like a fortune for their sakes, or rather for
her sake"- Guilford looked at me in a puzzling
manner.
"As, for Maud," continued he, "she should marry
Allen, and I would buy a library for him-a law
library."
Guilford then proceeded, as we arose and started
away after old Brindle, to speak of the present.

was prejudiced.
Nothing is wanting now but the prospect of some day
retiring on a farm, to render Guilford March "the
happiest man in America." T1is end to attain is
the ultimate hope, the grand climacteric of his day
dreams.
Besides supporting himself, Guilford paid no little
pecuniary tribute to the lady paramount,' our excellent
mother, to secure whom in the unembarrassed possession
of Lilac Cottage was the first object in the youth's
heart.
"But one more payment to make, "quoth Walter, as
the two went searching the wood, pausing occasionally
to hark for the sound of a-=cow-bell.
" But one more, and then the cut off lot to repur-
chase."
" If we can I" said Guilford, emphatically-
"Why may we not ?" I inquired.
" The gentleman who bought it has gone away, leav-

Magroy."
"What, Old Growl ?"
"Yes, Alen told me so.-yesterd y. He caine down

"But were we not promised .the refusal of it ?"
"Mr. Magroy may interpose sore friendly obstacle,"
said Guilford ironically.
"That old man iS our evil genius !" I cried.

"I am very sorry, Mr. Magroy," spoke the major,
again sitting down, :"that circumstances should have
brought about this scene, hey!"
"Please proceed, Major Fontenoy, proceed," replied
Mr. Magroy meekly, sipping his wine and. water.
"My object in calling, sir, was in a friendly way to
reconcile you to your son, the best- young man I ever
knew, hey ! as well as to set the conduct of other per-
sons, the subject of our late conversation, in a fair light
before you, hey! you will please perceive that I had
no vulgar desire of meddling with your affairs, hey !"
"I will apologize," exclaimed the old man in a whin-

"No apologies necessary, hey !" continued the major,
somewhat gentler in manner, and less dry and cold in
tone.
" What I wish, sir, is more ample satisfaction,
hey!"
"What, sir, do you want !" -demanded Mr. Magroy
peevishly--for an LL.D.
"That you heal these unhappy differences by a simple
act of justice."
Mr. Magroy sipped his wine and water, and tapped
his cane on the table in silent abstraction a long time.
Finally he said,
"Major Fontenoy, you will pardon me 'for bringing

"Mighty little honor," quoth he.
"There may be some in his heart," said I.
"I don't believe in fire till I see either smoke or

At this moment, happening to look from the library,
through the lilac trees, upon the mottled lawn, who
should we behold but the old Scotsman coming over the
grass, stamping his cane, and looking down like Winter
trampling on the lingering train of Autumn. Guilford
seized his hat and departed for the warehouse. He met
Mr. Magroy. That -good-natured gentleman stopped

CHAPTER XXV.
THE YOUNG COMMODORE.
ON returning to his castle, did Mr. Magroy notice
Mrs. Polypheniia Fidgets' face at the window?2 Did he
see her shrink away?  Did the good man of the house
know that his worst enemy still presided over the con-
cerns of that abode of peace and happiness?
Mrs. Poly had but o 'e eye, yet Mrs. Polyphemia saw
a long way. For instance, she saw that the illumination
of her master's mind' concerning a variety of little
matters, was nothing more than a rift in the cloud, which
must soon close again,  asking darkness darker. Mean-
time, she saw it was h r policy to keep out of his way
-she would soon render her services, her ver presence,
nay, heir counsels,'necesary ; for even that massive, com-
pact mind must put forth little tendrils, feeling for sym-
pathy.
Mr. Magroy closeted with his will and his Bible; bde
changes one and consults the other daily. Now he is
seen busy writing, and again he compares himself:.with
all scriptural characters, from outcast Adam to the
stricken widow of Nain.
By artful and gradual approaches, the spider Fidgets,

drew the great bluebottle fly Magroy, into the toils of
her mazy net. In less' than a-month, she had gained an
influence over her victim,; more powerful than ever  It
may be needless, to ay that the light which had lately
broken in upon his troubled-soul with referenc'to the
arches, the fear, th e shame and the self-reproach, all
gradually vanished, and left him a blind listener to the
isinuations of Mr. Fidgets. A   new element soo"'
mingled in the blindfold war raging witi$Pihim.--avarice.
Mr. Magroy never lad been an avaricious man-neve-
since the period of his youth,-Mony  was lavished
upon Mrs. Magroy more profusely that, that prudent
woman required:    llen knew no stint until he left the
paternal roof. Even Mrs: Fidgets had, until ncw, lived
in silks and clover:
Now, Mr. Magroy is a miser.
This interesting change in our neighbor's character
first came known to us, on the occasion of Guilford's
calling to pay the las.installment on Lilac Cottage.
",Mr: Guilford   arch, believev, air," said Mr.
Magroy, as my broth r entered the office.
"Yes, Mr. Magroy" replied the latter respectfully.
"Your mother, sir "
"Is well, Mr. Iagroy?'
" Is a what ?"' he cried.'
" Quite well, sir."
"My son been to your house of late, as much as ever.

"No sir, he has not entered our hous"for year."

All the same! all he same !" he nkuttered, "under-

.2-Fi fool them y t," he exclaimed, looking fiercely at
Guilford.
But happily he caught sight of the little canvas bag
in which Guilford ha brought the silver and gold for
the payment. His ey s glistened with unnatural fire as
he looked, forgetting everything else.
"Ah ! I know you pant to pay, sir. Let me see the
in t the coin, sir! !uick !a, and the poor creature-
poor with-all his wealth, learning, and honors-hurriedly
advanced to clutch the object of greed.
Guilford drew back saying firmly-
"Stay Mr. Magroy, you forget yourself, sir. The
papers first--the bill of sale, pote, deed."
"Oh ! yes," he answered, in' a plaintive tone, that
ancient over-bearing temper humbled to the dust.
The papers were delivered as soon as the trembling
miser had counted, weighed, and inly devoured each
piece. separately, as he, tooksit from the bag. Guilford
felt a thrill of pleasure as. he took in possession the evi-
dences of Mrs. March's sole estate in Lilac Cottage.
He gave notice to Mr. Magroy, that he should ere
long repurchase the cut-off lot, and bidding him good-
morning, he went home to, make holiday with the
family.
Not long afterwards, Guilford was surprised ;to see
NMr. Magroy enter the. counting-room of the waiehouse-
He passed through the office without deigning to notice

my brother,,and held al'long conference with Mr. May-
flower in the private business apartment. Shortly Mr
Magroy passed through again, went out; Mr. Mayflower
came in, rubbing his hands.
"Guilford, what do you think old Mr. Magroy-has.
proposed "
"What, sir?"
"Why to enter into a co-partnership with me, ha! ha-!
ha! as i I'd have such a glum old furatrader prying

"Whysir," replied my brother, "under the present
state of the finances, his money bags. might help yo
out of your difficulties"
" I thought of that too. But what do you think was
the condition upon which he was to favor me with, his
assistance ?"
"I cannot imagine, sir" said Guilford, nibbing a pen
with his knife.
S" On the easy condition that I discharge you."
At that moment the edge of my brother's. pen-knife
went through the pen, and almost through the thumb
nail.
" What, sir f"

"That your friend hip for my father and mother "-
"Nio, sir, not a word of it. I said you were the best

become one of the first business men in this community,
and that it was my intentionnext spring to take you into
the concern as partner. That is if you"-
" My dear Mr. Mayflower I"
"Not a word my d  ear friend"-Many gentlemen would

But Mr. Mayflower was a gentleman f simple-per-

And the firm become' Mayflower &amp; March.
There were "not a few things in Quilford's present
mode of life-to say nothing of its contrast with tis

meant to thousands of needy sailors and ambition
artisans, challenging sister cities for competitions, and
carrying, or rather staggering under pecuniary burdens
that, would crush a score of less able men together.
All he wanted," he said, was a little more "young
blood," and now he has it.
These excitements aroused the. best energies of Guik
ford March. If he had genius, it lay in -contrivances,
or fetching 'things about, and now all the powers of his
mind were drawn into play by a business demanding
great ability,. It had likewise its pleasures. The rivalry
the patronage, the launch, the contract with sailors and
shipbuilders--frank, hearty, honest, friendly, often disc
interested classes both-quickened:and ennobled the
pulse of life. Hi early fondness for the water,.too, was
gratified in a modified, but agreeable form. He' went
at times from port to port, crossing the wind-tossed
white caps of Lie Erie, or the miany-hued surface of
Lake Huron; he dashed down the rapids of the St.
Lawrence, and sailed beneath the picture rocks of grand
old unknown Superior--passing on his way, or;pausing
to gaze upon the Arch Rock, and Sugar Loaf, where the
mythologic Indian gods once dwelt in Maekinaw--.the
Mount Olympus of the Red man-but still more nearly
interesting to Guilford' as the scenes of his father's
gentle intercourse with Indians 'and Frenchunen.
By degrees my brothe acquired a sort of a sailor rol
in his gait; the people  lled hinthemyoung com

rtiness of his manner, rendered the good-looking
young fellow both estimable and popular.
Dock life, so to call Guilford's present career, gives
rise to a peculiar species of men... To be sure, there is
a flavor of tar - and oakum perceptible, yet tar and
oakum  ore often valuable to fill the chinks of leaky
veessels; and bluff, hearty, even rough usages may tend
toetopte small crevices of a weak nature-4he better
able to buffet, with: the waves of life. A man on the
dock is apt to be sound, and tough-hearted for the right,l
and independent, combining part of the bluff honesty
if the sailor, and part of-the thriving industry of the
Iandsman . He launches vessels on whose decks little
communities live and labor, .nd do battle with wind
ad wve. He hears' of them in distant porter, and his
interest' and sympathjs stretch abroad to them. Hun-
eds;, perhaps' thousands,, with their wives and little
onen depend upon his enterprise and. calculation, his
p    oden:e, foresight and humanity. And he feels a
snse of power. .Power, that necessity to a. human
being, the element which tries him, the scale which
weigh' 'hin ,andad makes know  what manner of soul
he is.  Under guch influence my brother Guilford

It is unnecessary to detail all the steps we took  t he
business for which I had come. There were several
difficulties to be encountered.  There was WI one
member of Congress fromour State. The   r
faction of the constitue cy, howeverwas so  ge that
we were allowed two ca ets. It wasthecutom gener-
ally for the member to o4inate the' cadet,' but as there
were -two, the natter ws. shared between the member
and our two senators. Yet neither senator had the
power of nomination. Thus all depended :pon the
member. These facts we learnt by visiting the secre
tary of warthe -enginee bureau, and the commander
in-chief. To . the last  delivered Major.'onten

an ornament to the army. But he said he had no influi-

to a very handsome 'and bright complexioned multto

There never was a nobler fellow than Dick, white or
black, and yu should have witnessed the mingl d con-

him ;over thi part of lis story.

"Sir, you are too noble ! too liberal ! to take issue
with them on the difference of a shade of meaning in a

"Well, give me the letter," he said, petulantly. Mr.
Tapes handedit to him eagerly. "There," said he, as he
erased the objectionable term, and wrote the necessary
one over it, " I believe thi4 offlce- of chief engineer
should be abolished, and the business of fortification
controlled by a committee of Congress, as it was in the

every demonstration of joy and affection M. Latrobe
also handed me a short letter from my eldest brother
John, inclosing, a bank note of considerale value, and
inviting me-pressing me-I may say,, to come on to
Canbridge and visit him until the June term at West
Point should commence. I loitered i the political
Metropolis of the nation, long enough to study the
architecture of. the public buildings,  ear the most
eminent orators speak, and pay visits of farewell to my
friends Dick and Mary, the clergyman, nd Mr. Tapes
-with whom I dined.-
Dick said that when the administration broke up he'd
like to return to good old Detroit. Mar told me con-
fidentially she was dying to go there, to . I promised
to find, if possible, a place that might e able them to
settle down comfortably, and took my leave of them
with a full heart.
Tapes said, coming with me to the door of his lodg-
ings, he had a word of advice that he would respectfully
suggest.
"Speak it out,, dear sir. I am not he head of a
bureau, that you should hesitate."
"Then, Mr. Walter, don't graduate from West Point
into the engineers."
" Don't believe I could, if I wished."

Ignorant of what he meant, but profoundly impressed
with his manner, I squeezed Mr. Tapes' hand, and we
said good-bye!
The secret of thepoor gentleman's dislike must lave
laid in the eternal routine of his own duties, year in and
year out, casting up costs, quantities and qualities, of
"building materials for works of fortification."
John March's liberality enabled me to travel "like a
gentleman," as M. Latrobe would-say.
Walter took passage in the railway cars for New
York, and in seven days found himself, neither, at West
Point as he expected, nor at Cambridge, where he was
invited, but at Detroit, where he was delighted, with
Major Fontenoy, studying mathenatics,.and with Mabel
Latrobe, studying her, himself, and the tender passion.

Guilford and I were reclining on Air Castle Bank one
serene Sunday afternoon in May, ien we observed an
un'nal column of smoke rising over the spot we always
fatcied ourlouse to occupy. We started t our feet,
a1d commenced running towards the city, but the
cohumxn growing more and more slender, and finally
dying away entirely, we proceeded home more lei-
surely.
On reaching the lawn we found articles o: furniture
lying in confusion on the grass in front' of the cottage.
There were one or two damped blankets spread out on
the root which was hi'red and black for the space of a
fe feet around the chium y at one of the gable ends of
the roof. On going rad tothat side of the house we
s awthe blackened water still coursing down over the
clapboards to the, ground. It seems that the chimney
had taken fire, which communicated by soman means to,
the wod-vork around thie chimney, and undOr the roof-

THE BATTLE OF WINDSOR
A FRONTIER EPISODE.
Oxi evenin   my brother Guilford and myself were
out enjoying    eauties of such a blue stai-lit sky as
King March sometimes canopies himself under after the
tumult of a storm. .A little way above the city we
were overtaken by a sturdy-looking pedestrian, with a
knapsack strapped to his shoulders, and a belt around
his waist, to"'which were fastened a bowie-knife and a
tin cup.
"That is a patriot," whispered Guilford.
The city was filled with Canadian refuges, together
with a promiscuous gathering from various parts of the
United States, intent on taking part in the quarrel
between the provinces and the mother country. Th
people along the Apier4an frontier sympathied deeply
with the, revolutionists-and'it was whispered among
the qd inrnes, that even gentlemen connected with
both state and general governments contributed secretly
to the cause. For these reasons, unless men were found
actually 'asnib led in arms, they were no likely t
be moieied-ndividuals, notoriously knovn to be
'patriots,"came anal went openly.

late in their day, and seeing them through the medium
of childhood, we have not ventured, in these sketches, to
attempt more than to throw an occasional flickering ray
upon the manners and customs of the simple race.
With some of the peculiarities of those who have sup-
planted them, especially the earlier folk, who caught
not a little of their genial light and warmth, our
memory is more at home. It may be a pleasure for
some, whose pulse is beating high beneath the torrid
