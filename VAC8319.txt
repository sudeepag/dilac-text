               CHAPTER I. 
                
                  
                      
                        --"Or night or morning is it? 
                        I wist not which: a dull and dismal twilight, 
                        Pervading all things and confounding all things, 
                        Doth hover o'er my senses and my soul." 
                     
                   
                
               ONE lovely morning a number of gypsies might have been seen congregated on a small spot of greensward, nearly surrounded by copsewood. One portion of the wanderers lifted the insensible form of one of their comrades from the grass, and took their silent and melancholy course by a devious pathway running through the copsewood until it terminated on the sloping bank of a circular dell, or bottom; in the centre of which bubbled a spring of pure water reflecting the clear blue face of heaven that smiled above. 
               The remainder of the gang had been despatched to bring their camping materials from the green lane which formed their previous night's bivouac. 
               The spot they now sought was romantic and sequestered, and might, to an imaginative mind, have suggested an idea of the primitive or druidical worship adopted in England in the earliest period of her history; and which, most probably, was originally brought from the East. The appearances it presented were truly symbolical of the primitive worship of mankind. 
               On reaching this sylvan retirement, the bearers silently deposited the senseless object of their solicitude, and then dispersed to collect the dried and withered foliage, which the advent breath of winter had scattered around to their hands, and of this simple material quickly formed a couch, to which they removed their comrade; and the old gypsy woman seating herself at his head, betook her to examining the nature of the wound inflicted on her grandson. 
               Washing away the blood, she discovered that the pistol shot of Will Watch had passed through his hat, and, ploughing up the flesh in its progress, fractured the upper portion of the skull, a small traingular splinter of which pressed on and irritated the fine membrane beneath. The superior part of the fractured bone, from the swollen state of the surrounding integuments, assumed the appearance of having started from its proper position, and added to the dangerous character of the wound; while the fever, incidental to any injury of that prime organ of sensation, the brain, dried up the wet rags continuously applied by the gypsy grandam, turning them black by the raging fierceness of its heat. 
               With the bold hand of one to whom the vicissitudes of a vagrant life had rendered such accidents familiar, Moll Purely, steadying the point of her knife by holding it short, keeping a firm wrist at the same time pressing it against the check-bone of the wounded man, directed her attention, in the first place, to the detached splinter; and you might read the natural feelings of the old mother in her deep intensity of look and the tremor which shook her powerful frame, and even communicated itself to the sharp instrument she held. 
               Fixing her eyes, however, steadily on the minute object before her, for a breathing space, she renewed her nerve by pressure, and with a sudden twitch raised the bony particle, which, seizing firmly with her left hand, she cut or dissected out; while the membraneous substance covering the brain having been restored to contractility by cold applications, she sheared off the dark and clustering locks of her grandson, and raising the depressed bone, and bringing the jagged ends of the lacerated wound nearly into apposition, covered the whole surface with a plaster composed of turpentine and other gums, to force the adjacent muscles to an upward action, leaving nature to do the rest. 
               Shortly after the removal of the splintered bone, the eyes of the wounded man half opened; though, as yet, the nerve that conveys unto the brain a notion of surrounding objects, from that universal inlet of reason and experience-that grand embellishment of nature, whose quickening organization gives a being to sensations of pain or pleasure, long ere the mind can be said to think of either-the human eye had not relaxed its rigidity. But, though the fine organs of sight gloomed without speculation, they presented to the observant grandmother a sense of weight which, speaking of life, lit up her features with a gleam of joy; and, as she leant over the body, she hailed the symptom as a reward of all her care and anxiety. 
               While the old gypsy was thus engaged in tending Bernard, Frontibelle had crept close to her grandam; and fixing her beautiful gazellelike eyes in a gaze of intense interest, anxiously watched old Moll's countenance, reading therein the secret hopes and fears which by turns agitated her bosom, and reflecting its varying expression, as the anticipations of the old woman foretokened pain or pleasure. 
                
               Hitherto the grandmother and the sister had continued a deep, solemn silence, scarcely trusting themselves to draw a breath. 
               On observing the above symptoms, however, old Moll, hastily drawing the skirts of the tented canopy, they had formed by throwing a broad blanket across the strong projecting arm of an old oak, around her grandson, so as to exclude the light, sat herself down upon a broken bank of earth at a little distance, yet sufficiently near to enable her quick ear to catch the lightest breathing of the boy she loved so well, motioning Frontibelle to follow her example; here for a time they continued in deep and melancholy stillness, well suited to the solitude about them. The voice of the wind was hushed, and the half-bared trees, silent as the chamber of death, fed and strengthened the deep feelings which Bernard's accident had engendered. 
               "Wot ye who hath done this, Frontibelle?" said the old gypsy, at length breaking the silence. 
               "Nay, mother, how shall I?" 
               "Seek not to know it then; question it not; demand it not; for if aught happen that Bernard Purely shall be given to the earth, that which has well nigh broken my old heart must break thine entirely, girl!" 
               "Mother!" exclaimed the younger gipsy. 
               "Mother!" echoed her grandam. "Mother! Ay, that name clings to us through all our weary pilgrimage. Mother! the sound brings back the long, long, yesterday of life, with all its joys and sorrows. Mother!-Mother! girl, I think I see thy mother now, when, young as thou art, rejoicing in her beauty. But she is gone, girl-dead! And I-I have outlived my pride! lived to this day. Lived perhaps to-to what a cruel fate am I reserved should Bernard Purely die!" 
               "Mother, what do you mean?" 
               "Revenge, girl!-revenge?" cried old Moll Purely, with a fierce look, while her teeth gnashed together, and her voice seemed struggling for utterance and half lost in the gurglings of inward excitement. "The bitch-wolf cherishes her cub, and will fight for the offspring of her lair; fierce natures have fierce instincts. Shall a gypsy forget the lesson nature teaches all?" 
               The gypsy ceased to speak, but her look of bitter malice plainly indicated a point of injury that could find no plea of forgiveness in her heart. Not so with Frontibelle, who, in her excitement, would have slain the rival whose blood she dared not afterwards to look on. Revenge, in both cases would have prompted murder; but the elastic mind of youth, yielding to the milder instincts of our common nature, would have found remorse where the slow and deliberate determination of age defied compunction. 
               "Whom do you suspect, mother?" again demanded Frontibelle, breaking what seemed to both an uneasy silence. 
               "Nobody, child," returned her grandam, evasively; "Farmer Ashford." 
               "Farmer Ashford!" exclaimed the girl, in a tone of astonishment; "impossible! Farmer Ashford, I am sure, has no quarrel with my brother; and has always treated us kindly." 
                
               "Ay, ay!" 
               "Then why suspect him?" 
               "Girl! I have warned thee not to ask me." 
               "I must, mother, I must! Nor will my heart be at rest until I have your meaning. Father Ashford cannot be the man you aim at." 
               "I have told thee already I will not be questioned," sternly repeated the old gypsy woman; "and you should know me well enough to know that when I mean to keep my mind I keep it." 
               "But you have said, mother--" 
               "What?" 
               "That what you think will break my heart-" 
               I have said it, Frontibelle-I have said it! and it is enough. I shall soon know the truth; and then, if Bernard dies, I will have blood for blood. They must be well kept who escape my knife when I whet it on the stone," continued the old gipsy, fiercely; "for then I crave a victim. Not even the altar where they worship should protect him! The fools who worship heaven yet seek their fate of us. Ha, ha, ha! We have no worship save the wild liberty of nature, the whistle of the birds out holiest music-strong instincts our creed; our prayers, when young, out passions, and when old, out purposes." 
               "Mother, mother! tell me what you mean." 
               "An act of justice, girl!" 
               "You would not murder him, mother?" 
               "Whom?" 
               "Oh, good mother!" exclaimed Frontibelle; "search your own heart; recall the days when your feelings were as mine, and then ask youself who can, who could, I mean? There is but one else but you and my poor brother that I could deeply sorrow after." 
               "And that one, girl," said the old gypsy in an impressive tone, "I believe to be your brother's murderer!" 
               "No, mother-no!" shrieked Frontibelle, "you are too quick to judge. Watch is abroad-across the seas: nor do I believe, though he has stung me like an adder, he'd harm a single hair of Bernard." 
               "I tell thee, girl, he is your brother's murderer," asseverated the old gypsy, "nor is my judgement quickened by injury. Full well I wot no other had a cause--" 
               "If he had a cause to do it, mother-" 
               "Tell me not of cause," exclaimed the impatient old gipsy, "they are slow processes standing betwixt our oppressors and their wills. Should we, or such as we, copy them? No! Injury with us, begets resentment-resentment, death. If, therefore, Bernard Purley dies, wherefore should his murderer live?" 
               "Mother, I love him still." 
               "Has he not scorned you?" demanded the old gipsy, bitterly; "left you for another, held you up to the derision of the tribe? What are you called amongst us-'the chosen-the forsaken one.'" 
               "I have forgiven him, mother," replied Frontibelle. 
               "Forgiven him, child! But thou hast a right to pardon, though hope is a poor dish for one so deeply scorned as you to feed upon. Yet, when he adds a murder to these injuries--" 
                
               "Oh! then forgive him too!" 
               "Forgive him!-"exclaimed the old gypsy, in a hoarse guttural tone; "now, by the raging star that dries the brook, and murrains cattle, and strikes man with ague, thou hast lost the ancient spirit of our people. Forgive him, girl! Let me but prove my thought, and I'll forgive him with my knife's point, and then forget him, too-" 
               "Mother!" asked Frontibelle, sending a flood of affection through her eyes as she gazed on her grandmother, "mother, couldst thou stab me?" 
               The old gipsy averted her look, and, with a cold and solemn sternness, replied- 
               "Ay, to the heart, if thou canst forget thy brother Bernard's injury!" 
               "I thought you loved us both, Mother," pursued Frontibelle. 
               "Loved you both, child!" exclaimed the old gipsy, melting almost to tears, "loved you both! What is it makes my old limbs to shake as if I had the palsy? What is it makes me feel the half-bared trees around us, and the withered leaves upon the ground, a mockery of my heart's desolation? Say, girl, is it love, or is it hate?" 
               "If you love me, you will not harm him, mother," said Frontibelle. looking earnestly at old Moll. 
               "I have sworn it, girl! to my own heart have I sworn it, and it must be. Your brother would not rest; at least I should not, if he died unrevenged." 
               The old gipsy kept an averted gaze, while Frontibelle affectionately endeavored to turn her head that she might read in her eyes some hope of changing her purpose; but the old woman kept a solemn reserve which baffled all her efforts, till, suddenly starting to her feet, the latter exclaimed- 
               "Hark! thy brother's moving, girl." "Pardon him mother?" 
               "I cannot, girl," replied the stern woman; "yet his death depends upon Bernard's; and nature may perchance prevent an act which nature might afterwards reproach me with for life." 
               The last sentence of old Moll Purley was lost in feelings which chocked her utterance, when Frontibelle, with the lightness of the fawn, flew to her brother's side, eager of anticipation, and willing to hall the slightest movement as a prelude to returning life; but the bounding joy which animated the features of the younger gypsy was damped by the sedate and solemn sternness of her grandam, who, accustomed to tend the sick and dying, looked at Bernard's danger through the dim medium of an experience that checked the gleam of satisfaction In Frontibelle's eyes. 
               "He breathe's more freely, mother," said she at length. 
               "A free breathing does not always speak of life," said the old woman, kneeling by Bernard's side and examining his extremities; "yet there's fever in his feet," continued she-"that speaks of strength. I may save him, girl. Would I could hear his voice." 
               "Hark, mother!-he murmurs something." 
               "Do not speak-as yet he will not understand." 
               "Where am I?" said Bernard, faintly. 
                
               "Here, Bernard, with us, and out of danger," whispered Frontibelle; "mother, did you not hear that? He surely understands me." 
               "Silence, girl! His fever forbids the thought." 
               "I have hid my pretty Sue in a tom-tit's nest, and Watch shan't have her out with all his cunning. No! I'll have her to myself How old Pardo will twitch his pigtail when he finds she's married to a gypsey," rambled Bernard, in his delirium. 
               "Dost thou hear that, Frontibelle?" 
               "I do, good mother," returned the young gypsy, abashed by the error she had fallen into. 
               "Ha, ha, ha! yonder's a mavis cating a shoulder of mutton; and Tom the tinker swallowing boiling broth without a spoon! won't he burn his mouth drinking out of a camp-kettle like that?" continued the delirious man. 
               "He must have sleep," said the old woman; "he has not strength to bear this: and sleep will either bring him to death or health." 
               Accordingly, administering a decoction of poppies, the old woman again sat down by Bernard's side to watch the effect of the portion; when, after uttering several incoherencies, he sank into a deep, untroubled slumber. 
               Again carefully closing the skirts of the tent, the old woman betook herself to her former seat, followed by her grand-daughter. 
               "You now see why I spared Susan Wylie from your knife?" 
               "I do, mother." 
               "Child, child," observed old Moll, "there is more, much more, passes through this old brain than you can see. My child, I have staked for it, and the game is before me. I'll play it out, and will yet live to win it, and see you a bride after the customs of a land that holds our people vagrants and strangers." 
               "Alas, good mother!" said Frontibelle, while a strong tinge of shame suffused her features, "who would marry Frontibelle when even the desperate smuggler despises her? Who, tell me who, would marry with a gypsy?" 
               "Thousands, girl," returned old Moll with energy, while her eyes seemed to embrace the future with those quick and changeful glances, which alike mark prophesy and madness; "I tell thee, there are thousands in this broad island who would gladly marry thee, knew they the store of gold old Moll Purely has to dower thee withal." 
               "But of all those thousands, there is only one whom Frontibelle would bow to," said the younger gypsy. 
               "Shalt have him, girl! I say thou shalt, and my sayings have passed, girl, with reverence, ere how. Gold! it is their God-the only deity they pursue with worship. All! all! from the highest to the lowest, who bade me read their destiny, the object of their search was gold, gold, gold. The village maiden craved for gold-nature had given her beauty. The poor bind asked for gold-'twould buy a farm. The city madam lacked gold-'twould purchase secret pleasure and make the asthmatic citizen at home a wittol and a scorn. The laywer asked it for its breed: the doctor for an equipage; gamesters for another stake. Fate's wheel is tired with it, and rubs it into nothing in its progress. Gold, child! the metal works miracles, and forms a shrine in which the gypsy infidel would be bowed down to and worshipped as a saint by the truest believer among them. The gold they sought they gave me for my promises. Ha, ha, ha! Gold for a gypsy's promise!-good exchange. Gold, gold thou hast, and freedom, and with these may all things be achieved." 
               Fromtibelle looked at her grandam as she spoke, scarcely comprehending the rhapsody she uttered. 
               The poor though beautiful gypsy girl saw but one object, and the multitude of associations conveyed in the old woman's speech puzzled her; all she thought of was the man whose attentions had taught her to love him. For one kind look from the being she had selected she would have given her life. Gold was a thing she had never dreamed of, either as a rival or an ally; but her want of consciousness arose from a want of experience; her thoughts were as the flowers of the field receptive of the dews of heaven, but dying of too much moisture; not like the yellow indurated mass, tenant of the mine, placed beyond the reach of the one, and mocking the corroding influence of the other. 
               The excitement of the old gypsy woman having subsided, she paused, and then, as if under the withering thought of what her sterner resolution might call for, continued in a subdued voice- 
               "Yet, Frontibelle, if he has slain thy brother, though I love him for his bold daring as if I had borne him, I here doom him to destruction. Ay, doom him, although I strike thy heart through him I doom! Then what remains to old Moll, save but to wither like an old tree whose sap and leaves are gone? A thought of bygone joy may light her path for a moment, mocking her breaking heart, like the green moss that crowns the withering oak, merely showing the busy labor of the worm within that's crumbling it to nothing-no, nothing else-no, nothing else, girl." 
               She paused, well nigh overcome by the picture of prospective desolation her active mind had formed; wherein associations of kindred, friendship, feeling, love, ties upon earth, and hopes of a future being, which, though the gypsy creed contemus, still hover about the human heart on the wings of natural superstition, all were lost in the astounding consciousness of utter loneliness. While the young Frontibelle, fallen into a like melancholy, sate mute and motionless, unable to comprehend, yet unwilling, to enquire. 
               The arrival, however, of Mike the Mavis, so called from his skill in whistling the notes of the wild wood bird, announced by a shrill imitation of the rising lark, roused Moll Purley; and she started, and, laying her hand on the arm of the careless vagrant to cheek his ill-timed music, said, with solemn earnestness- 
               "Be silent, Mike! The very birds are silent, and you would not be less pitiful than they are, since the lightest sound might injure our poor Bernard." 
               "Why, what's in the wind now, Moll?" asked the new comer; "you were wont to like my whistling, and say as I could do it better than the birds themselves." 
               "Bernard has been shot!" replied the old woman. 
               "Worse luck, mother, worst luck!" observed Mike; "it 'ill set you a croaking for a month; an' our pot aint never keel'd arter thy own fashion, ould woman. But where's his hurt, Moll?" 
               "His skull-bone is broken!" 
               "Psha! that's a trifle!" pursued Mike; "you cured mine, you know, an' tuck a piece out as I never feels the miss on: akase why, I keeps it in my backy box, an' I don't know but my nutshell's just as thick as ever; so I aint afeard o' Bernard." 
               "That's right," said the old gypsy; "but don't whistle again, good Mike." 
               "Well, then, I won't," returned Mike; "but I am sorry for poor Bernard though acause we had got summut for dinner. Where's the boys, mother?" 
               "In the green lane of Copsewood. You must have met them." 
               "Not exactly, mother," returned Mike; "acause yer see, it worn't quite convenient to come that way, for a ship strayed out of a drove while the men war getting their beer. An' so Barney Nous and I, what does we do but scotches it, as yer may see by this here," said he, drawing a sheep-skin out of a sack, "which yer may as well clap on the fire as not, seein' as the signs of red ochre is awful dangerous to the line of life, in a matter of this here consarnment. An as yer can't turn up the mutton yerself, I suppose some of the young 'uns must do it for yer." 
               "You are right, Mike-right! 
                      
                        "Burn the skin, 
                        Save the sin!" 
                     
                   is a thriving proverb amongst us wanderers. But, tell me, Mike, hast thou further news for us?" 
               "Yes; the black schooner lies in Ramsgate Harbour, and her cargo at farmer Welling's." 
               On hearing this both females interchanged a look of interest. 
               "Said I not, Frontibelle?" exclaimed the elder gypsy. 
               "You did mother!" returned the latter, "yet spare his life." 
               "Never, if your brother dies," said old Moll doggedly. 
               "Promise me not to slay him," entreated Frontibelle. 
               "Silly girl!" cried Moll, "your brother may live: he sleeps, breathes, there are hopes; but we must play certain game. We have something else to care for. Watch must not see Susan. She must be ours, Mike!" 
               "Mother!" 
               "You can seize on Susan Wylie?" 
               "It you command it, mother." 
               "I do." 
               "Enough, I'd cut her whizzing an you bade me. But she's not at the inn, I know. I called there as I came along, to lay the dust in my throat, and seed nobody but Maypole Mag, Longtail Jerry, and the hummerman." 
               "You'd find her then at Copeswood. She must be secured. Watch must not see her. Seize and bring her here, and then into the pony cart and off with her to Longwood Bottom." 
               "But why commit this devilment, old Moll?" 
               "Dost thou presume to ask me!" exclaimed the self-willed woman: "away and do my bidding, or I will have thee hanged, although I hang myself to do it, crack-hemp. Question me no questions; away? You and Barney Nous can stag the girl. Yonder he comes, I'll burn the skin and dress the meat for you a while. Away, I say away!" 
               Mike and Barney quitted to do Moll's bidding; and a moment after the whole gang was seen moving down the winding path with their camping materials to form a fresh bivouac.
                
               It was broad noon, and Susan Wylie was still at Copeswood Farm. After the accident of the morning, she had not dared to leave it unprotected; not had Farmer Ashford, as yet, been able to accompany her home, although desirous of seeing Jeremiah Pardo, having some communications of an important nature from the bold smuggler who had just left him. Their noontide meal being finished, the jolly farmer and the pretty Susan went down the green lane, under the canopy of overhanging trees, towards her uncle's, retraversing the path that had been attended with so much danger to her in the morning. As she passed the tree near which she struggled with Bernard Purley, the blood, which still stained the spot, turned her sick, and she felt fainting under terror and apprehension; she looked timidly round, and almost expected to see the athletic ruffian again intercept her steps. 
               Leaning on the stout arm of farmer Ashford, she hurried on as if to exclude the painful recollections of the past, by removing at once from a scene so fraught with unpleasant reminiscences; until passing the bend of the road, on which the recent encampment had been formed, they reached the spot which Mike and Mavis and Barney Nous had chosen for their ambuscade. 
               Suddenly emerging from their covert, the two gypsies sprang forward and struck Bob Ashford with their bludgeons; who, though staggered by their attack, faced round and, half stunned as he was, made a manful resistance with his ash stick. 
               And, indeed, on a fair attack, Bob Ashford might have been a match for them both at cudgel playing: but, rendered half senseless by their vantage blows, he struck wildly at his opponents, although, with instinctive caution, he still endeavored to maintain the upper guard, and so defend his head from further injury. 
               Dang it, mun! what beest arter?" cried he, on receiving their first blows; when, recollecting the events of the morning, he shrewdly set down this attack as another attempt of the gypsies to get the pretty Susan into their power. 
               "Roon, girl, roon! a tell thee!" cried he; "the eend o' the leane an' thou art seafe! Roon, if thou lov'st Watch! Roon for it! I'se hold um in play. Roon, girl, roon--" 
                
               Poor Ashford was stopped by a tremendous blow above the temple from the bludgeon of Barney Nous, which laid the farmer senseless on the green bank on the road side. Rid of their sturdy opponent, the two gypsies turned to pursue and capture Susan Wylie, obedient to the commands of the old camp-mother. Sue, however, profiting by the momentary space obtained for her by her brave defender, had sped forward, and, gaining an advance of about twenty yards, had already cleared the copsewood. 
               "Sither mun?" cried Mike the Mavis, pursuing the girl at the top of his speed: "the wench will escape us yet. She'll get into the open road, an then good bye to her!" 
               "Mik'!" returned Barney Nous, pulling up for a moment, "there aint no use in runnin' yourself out of breath A'll show thee a speciment of gypsey sheutin' as a larnt in Suffolk, an' no mistake." 
               And immediately after sent his bludgeon whirling through the air with fearful rapidity. 
               Notwithstanding the distance, the aim of Barney Nous was so true that it passed over Susan's head close enough to brush her bonnet-when, bending forwards with a feeling instinctive of safety, she, at the same time, dashed her foot against an uneveness in the road, and fell to the earth. 
               A moment's space between, and the sturdy Mike and cunning Barney had laid hands on the prostrate girl; who, seeing herself in such a piteous condition, uttered the most piercing cries for help. 
               "C'up stash this gabble, marm!" cried Mike; "it ain't altogether wholesome for the likes of us. Be quiet, woollee?" and the powerful ruffian stood threatening over her with a cudgel. 
               "Come, marm, ye'd better be quiet," said Barney Nous, addressing the prostrate Susan, who still continued screaming; "what, yer won't, won't yer? then I stops yer pipe with the silky-leave me alone for stashing patter when I likes it." 
               And he threw a handkerchief over her head, which he secured below her chin, at the same time tying another across her mouth, so as effectually to stop her screaming, hurried her down the green lane towards the path before described leading to the gypsies' new encampment. They had hardly, however, mastered half the distance which lay betwixt them and the copsewood. ere Barney stopped in evident alarm. 
               "There's horn and iron in that sound, Mike," he exclaimed; "dost hear it?" 
               "I do," returned Mike; "and it will not do to the caught at work such as we are about, Barney, by folk as stride horse-flesh, let old Moll say as she will." 
               "Can we reach the dell path afore they near us?' enquired Barney again. 
               "They are too close for that. Nous," observed his companion. 
               "B--t them!" ejaculated Barney, in a tone which betrayed the warmth and sincerity of his devotional aspiration: "there's no avoiding them his way. What's to be done?" 
                
               "I have it! I have it! Bo!" cried Mike; "back,-Bo, back! Pass through the gap in Elder Hedge Row. We can stow her in the dry ditch till they pass us." 
             
             
               CHAPTER II. 
                
                  
                      
                        "I am forgive the envenom'd serpent's sting, 
                        But hate his loathsome self." 
                     
                   
                
               RID of his pursuers by the untoward accident in which the daring impetuosity of the little sheriff, who had failed in an attempt to capture him, had involved him, Watch, the smuggler, sped across the fields towards the town of Whitstable. 
               On reaching the town, the bold smuggler found himself at home: the oyster dredgers on the flats at Whitstable doing, as it is termed, no inconsiderable stroke of business with the people at Welling's Hole-the smuggler's rendezvous-lending the aid of their vessels as a simple yet secure mode of communication with the London market. 
               Captain, or Jack Eden, who was preparing to start in his boat, then nearly half-laden, from the flats to Whitstable, with a mortal gorge for the flats of London, laughed heartily at Watch's recountment of the various misadventures that had occurred through Bridget's mistake in taking him for an old soldier, blind of an eye, and accusing him of an attempt to ravish her Jack Eden at once proffered Will a trip to the great metropolis. 
               Our two friends were soon aboard a light vessel, on the stern of which was painted in characters legible enough, "The Good Intent, Whitstable," with a cargo of oysters, whose grand characteristic, like that of Englishmen in general, seemed a determination never to open their mouths until they were actually enforced to it. 
               It was not so, however, with Jack Eden and Will Watch, they had a thousand pranks to talk of-from the period they first went out mackarel fishing to the present epoch of their history: and, as is generally the case through life, there might be some question whether each did not wish himself in the other's situation when the conversation ended. 
               Both had become, in the homely phrase of the world, comparatively well to do-nay, they had grown tolerably rich by their respective pursuits. But the spirit of romance which inhabits the breasts of most men who have been brought up from their boyhood on the uncertain element, tinged the mind of Jack Eden with a slight degree of envy, when Watch narrated the mixture of the dangerous and ludicrous necessarily involved in the erratic course he had chosen: while the smuggler himself looked silently at his friends's boat, and, when he called to mind his continuous hazards, almost breathed a prayer for an equal degree of competence and safety. 
               Their little vessel safely reaches Gravesend. Sea reach is over-run. Erith is left behind. Blackwall point is made, and the voyagers begin to think of a civilized community, for the bank of the river is now studded with gibbets, in cautionary premonition to those bold, and haughty spirits who, if they were not now and then reminded there was such a thing as law, might, perchance, forget they carried hanging matter about them. 
               Our bold smuggler looked at the "hanging woods," alike memorials of the fraud of government and the depravity of mankind; and then, as the mind is ever active in associating the past with the present, thought of a recent desperate encounter between his boat's crew and the custom-house people, in which two of the latter were slain, and it is no imputation to his courage to say he felt some degree of inward horror on thinking of the fatal termination which might, perchance, follow that adventure. 
               We by no means claim for our smuggler that lofty contempt of consequences which can see no difference betwixt being held up in iron hoops and hands rivetted together as long as the tenacity of a man's jacket and trowsers prevent his bones from falling out with each other, and so separating by mutual consent, and mouldering quietly in the grave when gathered upto his fathers: and the free spirit that spurned the control of every power, on earth, yet craved a morsel of that earth to shelter his remains from insult when his own arm could no longer resent it. Ungifted with the heroism of "Captain M'Cleane," of "Dick Flybynight," who rather gloried in a prospective swing from "Tyburn Tree," Execution Dock had its due share of terrors for him: and Will Watch, who, in defending what he conceived to be his own property, would have faced danger like a bayed lion, and returned shot for shot, and blow for thrust, still deemed the gallows a disgrace. 
               Greenwich toughed his heart with better feelings; and the thought of the purpose to which it was devoted half reconciled him to the idea of being an Englishmen, spite of his own pursuits, his purer nature identified itself with the best and most virtuous institutions of the country. But this night have arisen from vanity; or it might have been allied to young ambition, ere the withering touch of self-interest had warped it from its purer purposes. And then the sight of the fine old fellows in blue, the veterans, who might be seen by the half-dozen, on a sunny day, leaning on the hand-rail bordering the terrace or wharf in front of the hospital, with an expression in their, countenances sufficiently sedate to give to nothing an important feature, and impart a something-to-do-ish appearance to the sheer idleness of the hour; now looking at the green bank on the opposite side of the river through their telescopes, as if the Lords of the Admiralty had appointed them daily inspectors for the Isle of Dogs; then shifting their glasses to peruse the hull of a collier and guess at her name-and then stating the name, and then meeting a contradiction-and then laying a wager-and then referring to an umpire, who invariably spat in the water ere he ventured to give an opinion-and then adjourning to a beer house. These are peculiarities which render the Greenwich pensioner interesting to all: so that without laying any claim on our hero's behalf to a sentimentality he did not posses, we may safely affirm he felt like most other people on the subject. 
               With a fair breeze and favorable tide they passed Deptford, amid thedocks, wet and dry, on either side of the river, filled with the bulls of shipping, whether under repair or in the process of formation, and made what is called the Pool; and, sailing up to the Thames in the midst of a forest of masts which told a lively lesson of the commerce of old England, and the prosperity of London, ran into Billingsgate Dock just as the bell in the market house announced the tide had left its mark in the centre arch of the old London Bridge; when, under the purview of the old, custom office and the thousand and one busy traffickers within, our bold smuggler, buckling on his knapsack with the air of one who had little to hope, and, therefore, not much to fear, landed on the market quay. 
               Passing through a place known, time out of mind, as the emporium of all the recerche phraseology of vulgar English, his appearance soon attracted the attention; nor were the busy marketers wanting in familiar epithets to badger a red-coat, a soldier being held in proverbial disesteem among the lower orders in England. "Hahoo! twig the green feather! Who stole the hoot jack? Heads up, swaddy, and tell us how your mammy does! What will you take for the kit, and give you back the pipe-clay? Soldier, will you buy a dog?" were bandied about from mouth to mouth, with other idiomatical colloquisms which might go far to puzzle a foreigner in the translation; and which, indeed, in the present instance, were sufficiently mystified to bother our native. 
               Judging, however, form the tone of banter in which they were uttered, that opening his mouth might only expose him to worse treatment, he passed through the market silently. 
               Reaching Thames-street, he hastily passed up Simmary-hill, as it is called in the familiar phraseology of that district, and bearing away to the right, crossed an angle of Tower Hill, whence passing up the Minories, he reached Duke's-place, where he purchased a suit of clothes-and hurrying through Bevis Marks, he made for London Wall, there in the midst of several blocks of building, which stand, or rather totter, between the last-mentioned line and Lothbury embankment, seemingly merely held together by the tenacity of the limestone, the bricks having crumbled under the touch of time and vicissitude, he thought of taking a lodging to meditate the revenge he had determined on-amid emblems of ruin that would hardly suffer the idea of destruction to sleep within his mind. 
               After having enquired at several houses in London-wall, at which he received universally for his answer, "we don't take in no Irish, nor no sogers," Will Watch reconnoitred a wretched court, abutting as above described. 
               Stopping before a mean-looking house, on the window-shutter of which appeared a placard notifying to all whom it might concern that an apartment for a single gentleman was then untenanted: 
               "A snug retirement," thought our smugglen; "such a one as Bobadil adil might have solaced himself in when he returned from his tavern, or Bean Tibbs from the Ranelagh. 'Twill do for a time, however, and I shall not lack it for eternity. Humph! I may as well see how they treat a gentleman in this part of the world," and he knocked at the door. 
               A moment after, and it was opened by a boy with a pinafore of an indefinite color. and a face like a Norfolk biffin picked out of a mudcart, exhibiting streaks of red between lines of dirt, in utter defiance of the hospital doctrine of the affiance between cleanliness and disease. The youth was munching a thick slice of bread and butter. 
               "What der yer want?" said he, eyeing the soldier with a shy regard. 
               "You've an apartment to lit, my man," returned Watch. 
               "Mother!" cried the urchin, "here's a man arter our garret." 
               "Comen directly moment!" answered a voice from the deeps; and in the course of a brace of minutes, the youngster holding the door all the time, and most sinstrously eying the soldier, the lady of the house made her appearance, smoothing down her clean apron, and looking out at the corners of her eyes as if she had forgotten she had been fifteen years younger fifteen years ago. 
               "What did you please to want, sir?" questioned she. 
               "An apartment to sleep in," replied Watch, affecting the Irish brogue. 
               "We never take strangers in without a reference." 
               "Why, to say the truth, marm, I'm just arrived-my name's Trelawney-I'm a discharged souldire-an' as right rickonins make long frinds-will a fortnight in advance be enough?" 
               "Quite!" returned the tenacious landlady; "words is nothin-people's money is their money-at least, that's as my maxim, as' I ain't let loggins for fourteen year, come next quarter day, for nothin', I can tell yer. An' thof I'm a lone 'coman, I manages to keep the wolf from the door, an' feed myself an' Billy. Now, where are you goin' too, Mister Bill," she said, turning to that individual, who was sideling towards the doorway, "you aint a goin' to sneak out that way, so don't think it. Go down and fetch up a light, that I may show the gentleman the room. It's gettin' quite dark." 
               And as master Billy vanished from the passage, she commenced an eulogium on his obedience, which, however was interrupted by his reappearance with a candle stuck on the end of a ginger-beer bottle. 
               "Ha, you stupid little thing," said the loquacious landlady, coloring up, "why didn't you bring a candle-stick? But there's a nice candlestick for you, sir, on'y the japan'd part's a little worn off, an' a pair ov snuffers, on'y they wants somethin' done to make 'em go easy-but we can have 'em mended that's one comfort. Now, master Billy, I desire you don't go out." 
               "No, mother," said the boy. 
               "A nice, obedient boy that, as ever lived," said the mother. "If you'll follow me, I'll show you your room, sir; an obedient boy, as I said afore-minds every thing as is said to him." 
               And as they passed up stairs, Watch heard the street-door shut, 
                   
                     THE FIGHT WITH THE GYPSIES. 
                   and immediately after the voice of young Hopeful made the welkin ring with "widdy, widdy, way!" 
               Toiling up three flights of narrow, ricketty, and broken stairs, they at length reached the apartment, where any single gentleman might enjoy the privilege of stretching his limbs horizontally at and for the weekly rent or sum of three shillings, or three and sixpence if he desired himself 'done for.' It was a garret the shelving part of which would hardly admit a man of Watch's proportion to sit upright in, while all the space beyond a foot and a half clear of the doorway was occupied by a large stump bedstead, on the centre of which was placed a small flock bed, with two thin blankets, a rug and a pillow; one chair without a bottom stood beyond the bedstead, together with a dimunitive round table, and beyond them "the rusty grate unconscious of a fire." The damp was visible in huge patches about the room which left the yellow ochre with which it was colored, in alternate masses of dark and light; while the old leaden casement, with its diamond panes pieced here and there with paper, which had given way to the weather, now served the double purpose of admitting light and air; in short it presented a picture as miserable as a miserable wretch could wish to inflict on a more miserable fellow-creature. 
               Watch placed his hand against the wall as he took a survey of the apartment, not, however, unobserved by the quick-sighted landlady, who seemed to understand her business. 
               "It feels a little dampish, sir, I daresay," said she, "but isn't so-it isn't, I assure you. It on'y looks damp, sir! There isn't a thimblefull of water comes in, 'cept in very rainy weather, an' then we can't help it, you know. An' them broken winders, sir, the last gentleman what was here, an' he was a rale gentleman I'll assure you, an' none of your shim shams, said as them broken panes was quite an amusement: he did like the air uncommon, to be sure." 
               "Can I have a fire, marm?" asked Watch. 
               "Why," returned the landlady. "the other gentleman never had one-not as there isn't a grate, only it may smoke. But you gentlemen in the army are used to smoke, I dare say!" and giving a giggle at the sally she had made, she concluded, in a most insinuating manner-"I dare say we shall agree very well." 
               "You will get some coals immediately," said Watch, putting half-a-crown into her hand, "and as the rint, ye say, is three shillings a week, there are six, which will square accounts for the fortnight." 
               "If you wish to do for yourself," observed the landlady. 
               "Marm," said Watch, with a stare of interrogation. 
               "If you wish me to do for you, it'll be just a shillin' more!" 
               "Is that all? Then I'll engage the sixpence shan't stand between us, marm." 
               "There's the crockery in the cubberd," said the landlady, "and here's the key, on'y the washan' basin's broke a little, an' the water jug want's handle or so. But as my poor dear husband, who's dead and gone, used to say-that was afore we had furniture of our own-"You know, Molly, you carn't have silven spoons for eight'n pence a week. There's the key of the cupboard; you'll find the water-jug and the basin, and the other conveniences to match." 
               Having thus let the apartment for single gentlemen-very probably beyond her most sanguine expectations-the landlady ran out of the room to busy herself in getting in the coals, and the nice candlestick with the japan a little worn off, and to do all these petty details of a lodging-house-keeper's life, leaving the candle in the ginger-beer bottle to aid the new inmate of her house in any further inspection he might choose to make of his fortnight's freehold. 
               The rich contents of Watch's knapsack was a property too valuable to be hazarded in a situation so open to attack as the upper part of the houses generally are; and yet he knew that to show himself in any degree tenacious of that article would most likely arouse the suspicion of the landlady, and induce her to inspect it. 
               Watch, therefore, slipping the object of his fears from his shoulders, deposited it on the table, and taking the candle in his hand, proceeded to the window, which he drew back with some little difficutly from the rusty state of its hinges. Raising the light above his head, he looked first forward then around him. All was dark, silent, motionless as horror's self. 
               The hasty examination he had made convinced him to the impracticability of an attack from that quarter. 
               Satisfied with the cursory survey he had made that all was safe in the quarter most to be dreaded, after sending anotherr glance into the drear profound that terminated in a narrow court below, he closed his window with an air of greater satisfaction than he had begun his search, and quietly unlocking his cupboard, laid his knapsack on the upper shelf; again unlocking the cupboard,-he started. He looked around him-there was nothing; and descending the stairs, he found the landlady at the door, bawling herself hoarse after obedient Billy, to send him for the coals. 
               "Can you tell me where I can procure writin' materials, my good lady?" said Watch. 
               "O! don't trouble yourself about them there kind of things-my Billy shall run for them with pleasure-Billhe!" piped the landlady again with a shrillness of tone which produced all the effect of a boatswain's whistle on the tympanum of Watch, and then turning to out hero, she continued, "I wonder where, in the name of patience, the boy can be got to-Bil-lee!" 
               And, after another pipe or two, Billy sneaked up to the door, much after the style of a petted spaniel who has been beaten by his master, and as yet does not know how far he may presume to make free. 
               "You little rebel you!-did'n I tell you not to go away?" cried the enraged mother; "an' here's the gentleman a-waitin' for a fire all this time-I'll limb you, you little tyrant, I will." 
               "Why, I was on'y in at Jem Fagen's," replied the boy in a tone between a snarl and a whimper. 
               "Jem Fagen's indeed!" repeated the mother in a manner that conveyed more anger than she really felt; "I'll Jem Fagan you if ever yer goes out agin agen my will, you little villain! Go for the coals directly, do. I'm sure I'm finely holp'd up with ye;-an' the gentleman wants some writin' paper, d'ye hear!-an' take a teacup for the ink; or perhaps you'd like an exciseman's bottle, sir?" 
               The sound of such a term startled Watch, though a moment afterwards he reassured himself, convinced of the utter impossibility of the landlady attaching any covert meaning to it. 
               "They are on'y tup-pence, sir, an' the ink never spills out." 
               Watch nodding his acquiescence, the landlady continued, 
               "Mind Billy, yer to bring the ink in an exciseman's bottle, an' half a quire of paper-ask for Bath post-there's good boy, an' be sure you bring the right change, d'ye hear? There's one and fourpence for the coals, and three-'apence for the wood-you'd better get two bundles, Billy,-and tup-pence for the bottle, an' thrippence for the paper, an' a 'apenny for the ink-yes, a 'aporth 'll do, Billy, and then you'll have jist sevenpence out: now, mind you get the right change!" 
               "If ye make haste, my man," observed Watch, "you shall have the penny for yersilf." 
                
               "Oh, won't I!" says Bill, "I'm jigger'd!" 
               And away he ran as fast as his heels could carry him. 
               "I am sure, Mr. Trelawney," said the landlady, as master Billy receded from view, "I am sure there ain't no occasion whatever to throw away your money in that manner." 
               "Sure a man has a right to do what he likes wid his hone!" observed Watch, with a wink and a smile very much after the true manner of the people he was imitating. 
               "You Irish," said the landlady, "is so humorsome that it is quite a pleasure to be near you when you ain't vexed-though I must say that"- 
               "Say nothin' at all, my darlint," cried Watch, "but light the fire at wonst, for yonder's the coals comin'-faith, I thought the praspict av a penny 'ud stir his stumps for him." 
               And the smiling landlady, catching up the ginger-beer bottle aforesaid, preceded the coalman with the light, thinking at every step how fortunate she had been in getting so generous a lodger; and how he had given her what she asked at first; and then wishing she had asked him sixpence more; and how, as it was, he had given her more by a shilling a week than she could have got from any other lodger, without any demur or gainsay on the subject; and how he had given her an additional sixpence a week for attendance; and only wishing she had a dozen such gentlemen in her house, for she knew he must be one of the real kind; and when the Irish were gentlemen they were gentlemen; and if she only had a dozen such gentlemen in the house, her fortune would be made at once-until she reached the top of the staircase, almost as breathless as the coalman himself. 
               Finding her lodger had used the privilege of turning the key in his cupboard door, she directed the coalman to shoot the bushel of coal in a corner, and straight betook her to the task of lighting the fire, which, from the damp state of the chimney almost defied her art-the room filling continually with clouds of smoke, in spite of the ventage made by opening the door and window, until after having exhausted her stock of wood, she succeded in rarifying the air in the chimney, and the fire blazed up cheerfully, and imparted an air of far greater comfort to the little room than its wretched appearance at first spoke it susceptible of. 
               The landlady had hardly got the fire place in trim order, ere Will Watch appeared at the door of the apartment, bearing with him the paper, pen and ink he had received from the truant Master Billy, who had gone to spend his penny with his bosom friend, Jem Fagan; when, desiring her to prepare some brandy, hot water, and sugar, our smuggler betook himself to writing to Farmer Welling, one of his accomplices, to send up the boat's crew to an appointed rendezvous at the Old Blue Anchor, in Wapping, preparatory to the revenge he had determined on M'What, who had turned informer. 
               He had already ordered his schooner up the river to await his embarkation, intending to make his stay in the metropolis as circumstances would permit him. 
                
               Watch had completed and sealed his letters ere his landlady brought him the materials he desired, and putting the kettle on the hob of the Bath stove that graced his chamber, she began to busy herself in arranging the room; putting a clean pair of sheets and a pillow case, which, she assured him, were all well aired; and loitering about with a secret hankering for the brandy and water, which Watch, seeing that she had brought two glasses, good-humoredly satisfied her by giving her one, which having drunk, she left the room in perfect good temper with the whole world, and whispering her new lodger "good night," and giving him strict injunctions to take care of the fire, descended to her own apartment. 
               Left to himself, he sunk in a reverie, sitting over his lonely fire until night had lost itself in the morning; the poor and hard-working inmates of the house had long since sought the repose requisite to fit them for their next day's toil. The heavy bell of St. Paul's sounding the first hour of another day aroused him. He started, staring around him as if he had expected to find some one there, and felt an indefinite alarm creeping over him to which he was unaccustomed. Ascribing it, however, to the fatigue of the past day, he locked his door, and placing a small phosphorous box and matches on the table, he drew forth a pair of pistols, and, examining the priming, to see that he might depend on them, placed them within reach in case of necessity, and putting out his candle, threw himself on the bed, and was soon locked in deep and death-like slumber. 
               It had been said, that in London it is difficult to know one's next door neighbor, so universally worn is the mask of dissimulation. Now, though the landlady was guilty of those various peculations common to lodging-house keepers, she held herself perfectly honest because her petty pilferings had from time immemorial been recognized as legitimate perquisites, pertaining to the order in which she classed herself. Not so with some of her neighbors, for when Watch reconnoitred the state of his external defences against plunder, he as little deemed he was himself an object of observation, as that the attic opposite sheltered a brace of notorious cracksmen. Sitting in the dark they were silent observers of all that passed within his room; and seeing him so careful of his knapsack, they took it into their heads it was much more valuable than such articles usually are, and therefore secretly determined to appropriate its contents to their own purposes. 
               As soon, therefore, as the light was extinguished and silence reigned, they left their home, and masters of their business, were soon within the house of their opposite neighbor, where, with noiseless step, they reached the door of Watch's garret; gently wriggling the key through the lock it fell to the ground, producing a semi-effect on the sleep-entranced faculties of the care-worn smuggler, so as to disturb without entirely waking him. They paused a moment-all was silent; the next moment a pick-lock left the door at their command. The sudden flood of light, however, completely aroused the already startled sleeper. 
               "Who's there?" cried the smuggler, catching up a pistol and cocking it. 
                
               "Ding the darkey, and bob from the barker, Joe," said a strange voice, which was answered by a pistol-shot from Watch, in the direction of the speaker. 
             
             
               CHAPTER III. 
                
                  
                      
                        "Why camest thou thus? What is thy fearful purpose?" 
                        I know thou com'st for evil-but its purport 
                        I ask my heart in vain?" 
                     
                   
                
               ETERNAL praises upon the man who first discovered the humanity of the English law! he possessed an acute perception of minute objects that would have admirably fitted him for an entymologist. For instance, when a man too proud to beg, too honest to steal, and too fond of freedom voluntarily to seek aid from an union workhouse, when such a character, lacking means of paying for a bed, takes the common solace of our common nature beneath the canopy of 'kites and crows,' for 'weariness can snore upon a flint,' and is discovered in the fact, the laws of England, in such a case, provide him food and lodging, for which we see no reason but that the poor shivering wretch should be grateful, even though his superiors add the discipline of exercise, lest a too sudden change of diet should tend to induce obesity. 
               But whether the reader agree with us is not of the slightest moment to the progress of our narrative; neither do we care one straw if the English law be one straw less humane in its principles than that of the East, which punishes the baker who defrauds the poor in the weight of his bread by flaying him alive. 
               It s very certain that Ned Topman derived considerable advantage from the clumsy construction necessary to ordinances which attempt to render the free exercise of the natural rights of man, compatible with his social condition; for acting upon his undoubted right to be silent when he did not choose to speak, he lead wiser heads than his own into a state of uncertainty, and left them dancing like the devil upon two sticks,-in other words, bobbing up and down on a curved line depending from either horn of a dilemma. 
               After the failure of two notable plans to catch the smugglers suggested by Topman, and adopted by Captain Trunnion, the latter could hardly choose but begin to suspect his former favorite of some foul play in the transaction; the more particularly as the success of the smugglers in eluding the vigilance of the preventive men was publicly announced, accompanied by exaggerated reports of the run of goods by the contrabandists. Nay the newspapers even had the insolence to assert the smugglers were signalled from a preventive station ashore, which circumstance nettled the captain to such a degree, that he seriously began to question whether his old favorite did not carry a great deal more roguery under a rough outside than usually falls to the lot of a sailor, even when inducted in the demoralizing duties of a preventive coast guard. 
               The loss of Hardbrace-who had been murdered by Topman-joined with the death of Cox and Bracewell, killed in an encounter with the smugglers, as well as the foolish expedition Dealward, had become matters of public conversation; and that which had been at first detailed in private whisperings and under mysterious injunctions to secrecy, now formed the general topic among the gossips of Ramsgate and Broadstairs; the more particularly as several well-known contraband dealers, who being previously short of a supply, by serving their customers at the present juncture, tended to increase the public ridicule of the unavailing efforts made by government to stop a traffic called for by the wants of the community. 
               It was impossible for Captain Trunnion to stop his ears or close his eyes against a fact so disagreeable-the public derision of his people was too self-evident to be denied; and this had a natural tendency to increase his animosity against the delinquent Ned Topman, who, had been the confidential adviser of his superior officer in all his plans; and this animosity led him to employ all the vigilance his superior situation left at his command, to discover any laxity of discipline in the obnoxious preventive man which might bring him within reach of the severe code of the service, whose lightest punishment is death. 
               To this end he caused a variety of questions to be put unto Timothy Clarke, a shipmate of Topman's, so ingeniously constructed as to puzzle his understanding without bringing the inquirer an inch nearer unto the truth he was so desirous to elicit; for, as if in very spite of the master and commander's intention, our friend Timothy, though simple enough to pass for a fool, was also foolish enough to keep his word; and believing in the story told by Ned Topman as steadily as he believed in the gospel, and that the loss of their shipmate was the result of accident alone, he determined not to know anything of the matter in question; and this determined state of ignorance, coupled with his natural stolidity of look, was more than sufficient to bother the logic of a wiser examinant than the master and commander, who was thus doomed to encounter disappointment in every quarter, and abandon the idea of obtaining evidence, notwithstanding his strong conviction that Ned Topman was deeply implicated in the transactions of the night on which Hardbrace fell from a cliff, according to (his sole companion) Topman's account:-ay, deeply enough to warrant a strong suspicion that Hardbrace had been unfairly removed. 
               As, however, Captain Trunnion's ador to prosecute abated, Ned Topman became more clamorous for an investigation. Nay, he demanded an inquiry on grounds of character and long service, in terms which sufficiently proclaimed his innocence to a world which, on most occasions, takes appearances for realities. Nor would Topman, who knew that everything depended on his playing his cards properly, be satisfied until he had been duly and formally put on his defence-feeling himself pretty secure of an acquittal, from the paucity of evidence that could be brought against him; and knowing that were his innocence once proclaimed by a court of inquiry on a matter which proven would affect his life, he could not be tried again for the same fact-a humane maxim of law, both civil and military, on which he relied for security. 
               Teased thus by the clamor of Topman for an investigation of his conduct, Captain Trunnion was at length obliged to report; and finally, by prosecuting him before a court of inquiry, give the cunning delinquents his only chance of impunity. But in collecting the material for the prosecution, Captain Trunnion notwithstanding his own secret and indefinable impression of the culprit's guilt, in having murdered his shipmate, found abundant evidence to establish his innocence. The testimony of the seamen who had examined the pistol Topman pretended to have discharged to call the preventive guard to his assistance, was in itself sufficient for this purpose; and, indeed, almost led the master and commander to condemn the prejudice he had formed against his former favorite as uncalled for and unjust. 
               A court of inquiry was accordingly called and held ashore, at which the usual number of inquisitors sat in full uniform, with their president, an elderly looking man who wore a star, and heard evidence in the usual way-and then took the usual time to consider the matter-and then, as is usual in most cases where there is no testimony to convict, delivered the usual in most cases where there is no testimony to convict, delivered the usual verdict of acquital-and here without any point of reservation; a verdict which made Topman ready, as the most elegant writers of English express themselves, to leap out of his skin with inward satisfaction, although he still preserved a solemn gravity of aspect adapted to the occasion, and thanked their honors for having done justice to a man who, during many years spent in the service of his blessed Majesty, had never been placed in such a situation before; and he hoped their honors would enjoy the pleasing reflection of having acted humanely towards a humble man like himself: and he was proceeding to hope something more when, acting from a signal from the president, the officer of the court politely shouldered him away from the table, the gentlemen composing the inquiry, without a doubt, deeming any expressions of gratitude superfluous from a man whom they would willingly have hanged had they found an opportunity. 
               Now, among the crew there was none more sincerely rejoiced by the verdict of acquital than Timothy Clarke, whose conduct on the present occasion furnished ample proof that a fool who keeps his mouth shut is a far better friend than a wise man too prone to open that mischievous aperture, and who in delivering his evidence kept word and faith with the man with whom he had kept watch and ward, and had contrived to forget the blood on the hand-rail, and every other circumstance that could have led the sagacious inquisitors to infer the guilt of the accused; strictly confining himself to the statement of having been summoned by a pistol-shot to Topman's station, and having remained, after examining the pistol discharged by the master's mate, his companion until the morning; which was, indeed, all that could in conscience be expected of him; for, as he expressed himself. 
                
               "It warn't for the likes of him to be givin' an opinion on matters he warn't axed about." 
               Accordingly, when Topman was so unceremonlously thrust out of the room wherein the inquiry had taken place, the first person who tendered his gratulations was Timothy Clarke, who, in mere simpleheartedness and good will, howsoever different in other respects from Hamlet's friend in court, was always ready to convince any person who might attract his regard, by the iron grasp of his powerful fist, that it was a vice to know him, and now shook hands with Ned with a vigor which had certainly drawn tears from any other being but a sailor. 
               "I tould you so, didn't I?" cried Timothy in the exuberance of his joy, shaking hands with a power that would have threatened a landsman's shoulder with dislocation; "didn't I tell ye not to be down on yer luck? seein', as the song says, there's allus a sweet little cherub wot sits up aloft wot keeps watch for us poor devils as han't got no swabs on our showlders. I know'd somehow by my inards as it 'ud all be right-tho'f I mind as you were precious shakey; but I suppose that's all nat'ral under the circumstances." 
               "Thank you, Master Clarke!" returned Topman; "thank you!-you have done me a service this day which, if I live a hundred years, I shall never be able to repay." 
               "And who wants yer!" exclaimed the good-natured foremast-man. 
               "I shall never forget it, Tim!" 
               "Lord! Lord!" cried Timothy, "where's the use ov purtestin' to the like o' that. To be sure, I did intend to sarve ye, and that's a fact. So, when I guv my evidence, thinks I to myself, they sharn't git nothin' out o' me, with all their larnin' I can count five beans as well as 'ere a bos'n's mate in the sarvice, 'cute as they think themselves. What tho'f I harn't got no eddication, I warn't born'd yisterdee. Now, then, if so be, when I guv my evidence, I'd ha' outed with--" 
               "Hush!" said Topman, with an appearance of alarm. 
               "Hush!" repeated Timothy, "why I warn't a goin' to say nothin'; tho'f if I'd outed with you know what-how I could have made their honors stare-but they know'd nothin' at all about that ere, as ye know." 
               "They knew as much about it as I do, Tim," said Topman in a sharp tone; but "I suppose you told the truth." 
               "Why, as to that, I can't say but I did," returned the sapient Timothy, filled with the idea of having served the master's mate more than any other witness who had been called. 
               "Well, then, having once told the truth," continued Topman, "I can see no reason on earth for repeating it." 
               "None?" 
               "None!" 
               "Well," said Clarke, "if so be as that's your opinion, Master Topman, I won't say nothin' more upon the subject. But Lord! Lord! if I ain't as glad to see ye all right agen-ay, as glad as if I had a month's pay in my jacket pocket, and if that ain't if that ain't sayin' o' somethin', I don't know what is." 
               "Why, ay, Tim," observed Topman, "I don't think you mean me any harm; but when their honors have just decided for me, I shouldn't like any suspicion against me to get abroad." 
               "Suspicion!" 
               "Yes. It wouldn't be altogether well, Tim." 
               "Well, you know best," concluded Clarke; "and if I says another word on the subject, why I hope I may never have a mess of lobscouse in cowld weather, that's all." 
               "I know you mean me well, Tim". 
               "Mean you well! To be sure I does. An' if so be as you thinks as my talkin' will do you any harm, why, there's my hand upon it," said Timothy, continuing with a look of singular solemnity, as he drew his quid from the side of his jaw, "an' I'll not speak another word for a month-no, not so much as to say 'ay, ay, your honor,' for I likes you, Master Topman an' sooner than do you any injury whatsumever, I'd part with my last quid an' go without 'baccy for ever!" 
               Having thus succeeded in quieting Mr. Timothy's tongue, which, if suffered to go on, might have outrun itself, for Topman's purposes, before its master had the thought to stop it, Ned Topman shook hands with his shipmates and received their general congratulations; for, as Timothy had heretofore remarked, the ci-devant master's mate was universally respected by the men, because he had never abused his confidence with Captain Trunnion by carrying tales out of the mess. 
               But notwithstanding the excellent quality which had secured him the respect and esteem of his brother preventives, so prone is the human mind to suspicion, that Mat Spunyarn, on the way to the boat, could not help remarking to the sapient Timothy, who jogged alongside of him, that kissing went by favor. 
               "Why, wot d'ye mean by the like o' that, Mat?" cried Timothy; "haint the man had a fair trial, an' stud a fair chance? An' as for kissin' goin' by favor, when ye've been crawlin' over salt water as long as I have, ye'll find as the gentry as he stud afore to-day 'ud have him up to the gratins or run him out to the for'y'd-arm, jist whichsoomever war most conveenant for their amusement, if they'd on'y found half a p'int in their favor. Kissin' go by favor! I should think not in a court-martial, when the likes ov us is to be tried!" 
               The termination of the day's proceedings brought a relief to Topman's mind. He could now feel himself secure-he had had his trial-he had been honorably acquitted-not a single point had been reserved-suspicion dared no longer point at him-the murderer was safe-he felt himself safe. His heart swelled up with triumph, and he strode the earth with feelings of exultation. His mind's eye glanced back at the solemn mockery in which men no better than himself had sat arrayed in a temporary tyranny to deliberate on the life or death of a fellow creature. He contrasted their condition with his own-the odds appeared "all the world to nothing!" 
               Yet he had anticipated his presecuters in their strength, and turned their power aside: he smiled at the thought-yea, inwardly laughed to scorn what outwardly he was compelled to bow to. 
               Shrewd natural observers, howbeit, tell us that this state of exultation should never be indulged, inasmuch as it will always be found to precede depression in a proportionate degree; and so did our friend Topman prove it; for as our northern neighbors express themselves, "those channels of antiluct, the newspapers, ever ready to pander to a depraved and sickly curiosity, took up the matter, and the "Kentish Gazette" in a full report of the proceedings, made known unto the very limited number of his Majesty's lieges who derive instruction from that vehicle of information-viz, the hop-factor's of Southwark, as far as the metropolis was concerned, and the extent of the shrievalty among such men of Kent as found an interest in inspecting accurate market lists of the produce of the finest county in England for hops and agues. 
               No harm, methinks I hear some reader exclaim could accrue from the insertion of an account of a court-martial in a newspaper confined to such a circulation, and we should be almost tempted to give it in favor of that opinion but that the fact contradicts the assertion; that newspaper lay on the table in the parlor of the Talbot Inn, in the Borough, and, as fatal circumstance would have it, a certain person, with whom the reader is already acquainted, was led thither by an advertisement in another paper, headed "money"-which, as we protest against entering on details which do not strictly pertain to out history, we will spare ourselves the trouble of repeating. 
               Yes, on the day following the insertion of this account in the "Kentish Gazette," Marmaduke Mugswill, Esquire, of the Minories, arrived at the Talbot Inn, in a hackney-coach, to meet a gentleman who wanted money, as may many gentlemen of the present day, for aught we know to the contrary, but with this difference, the gentlemen who wanted money at that period required it on unexceptionable personal security, while, at the present period, personal security seems entirely to have gone out of fashion. 
               Yes, Marmaduke Mugswill bustled into the parlor, and Marmaduke Mugswill, who always took care of one of his Majesty's lieges, unbuttoned his top coat, and removing the interlacement of worsted he wore to prevent the antagonist principles of atmospheric air and his own gaseous evaporation meeting in the arena of his mouth, and giving him the tooth-ache, looked round the room, and rang the bell as if determined to let the whole house know it was a person of some importance who occupied the parlor. 
               The interim betwixt ringing the bell and the waiter's response, Marmaduke Mugswill occupied by carefully looking over his pocket book for the address of the money-wanting individual, which he had as carefully copied from the newspaper medium of announcing his indigence, but which, to his utter confusion, he was unable to find. 
               "I am sure," quoth he to himself, "I am sure it was the Talbot. How can I have mislaid the address!" 
               The waiter entered the room. 
                
               "Sir!" said he, with that peculiar stare of vacancy which, if it speak English, can only be translated, I have nothing to do until you are pleased to order me. 
               "Oh, the waiter! Yes, give me some-" be broke off abruptly. "A. Z-yes, it certainly was A. Z," self-communed Marmaduke Mugswill, unconsciously giving utterance to thoughts at variance with the waiter's meaning. 
               "We have no liquor marked A. Z," said the waiter, at a loss to know what the new-comer meant by such an order, "but we have some excellent treble X in the house." 
               "Then," observed Mugswill with a smile, "You may bring me a pint of treble X, two clean glasses, and say at the bar, a gentleman waits, in answer to an advertisement, in the parior." 
               The waiter vanished in the evaporation of order, to re-appear with something more substantial in the article ordered, when he intimated to the unfortunate Mugswill that the advertiser had been suited. 
               "D--n!" muttered Mugswill, pouring out a glass of the treble X; you may take away the other glass, waiter: I shan't do any business to-day." 
               But in that moment of disappointment he caught up the "Kentish Gazette." and his eye rested on the report of the court-martial. 
               "The Wasp! Topman!" thought he-"the name is familiar. Yes, it must be! and be commenced ransacking his pocket-book, and there hunted up the memorandum he had made of finding the pistol. The date corresponded with the supposed murder; and having just suffered a bargain to slip through his own fingers, the annoyance which that circumstance occasioned him had put him in a very excellent humor to do justice on any unfortunate devil who might fall in his way. 
               He read, and as he read the principles of public virtue asserted their supremacy, and altogether superseeded the pleadings of private charity. He felt himself singled out by an especial Providence as an avenger of the outraged dignity of society, and thanked his stars he had never been so careless as his fellow men, inasmuch as in early life he had accustomed himself to keep a diary which enabled him at all times to swear to all and every occurrence that had taken place during his existence, save such matters as had better, for morality's sake, be hidden, and which, to do him ample justice, he had religiously blotted from his memory. 
               It is not wonderful therefore that an individual who, throughout his life, had so rigidly kept a journal of all matters that did not militate against himself, should have decided on an immediate interference, if only for the sake of public justice. 
               "Twill make a stir," thought he, "'twill give more notoriety to the name of Mugswill than all my loquential efforts in wardmote or common council. My name will stand out in solitary ingenuity, the first individual who discovered a murder through the medium of an empty pistol barrel. 
               With reflections such as these he swallowed his treble X; and magnanimously nanimously resolving to carrt out intentions for the benefit of his country, for which his country ought to be very much obliged to him, buttoned up his coat, replaced the comfortable interlacement of worsted, and took a coach to Margate the same evening, whence he proceeded to Ramsgate on the following morning. 
               As was ordinarily the case with him, Captain Trunnion slept ashore; and as was usual with everybody else who held commissions in his majesty's service, at that period when money and personal security were equally plenty, a gentleman in a drab top-coat and worsted conforter was the very last character to be voluntary admitted into a drawingroom: and, accordingly, Marmaduke Mugswill, who prided himself on giving to everything he did a feature of importance, thundered out his announcement of the master and commander's knocker, our old friend Pedro, not entirely recovered from the effects of his scald, hobbled to the door, which he opened, eyeing the common-concilman as if the word bailiff were stamped on his tout-ensemble.
                
               "Is Captain Trunnion at home!" said Mugswill sharply, at the same time throwing his body back upon his left foot, and kimboing his arm above his hand partly supported his waist, as if to prevent the body from over swaying, his right leg projecting at the same time, so as to form, with the heavy cane he carried, two sides of an irregular triangle, getting his chin as far as the worsted comforter he wore permitted him, his whole appearance exhibited an air of vulgar consequence, which justified the negro's suspicions that his visit meant no good to somebody: "Is Captain Trunnion at home?" repeated Marmaduke. 
               "No, sar!" said the black. 
               "Sorry for that-want see him-business, importance!" 
               "Hab your car,' sir?" inquired Pedro. 
               "What?" 
               "Hab you 'dress car?" 
               "Young man, I never carry cards," said Marmaduke Mugswill, gravely; "I am an Englishman.-I set my face against all kind of innovation; and therefore, never basely condescend to copy the foes we have so often trounced, by introducing their pernicious practices on this side the Channel, from a dread lest the solid qualities of British liberty should be lost in the fopperies of French grimace. Say Marm aduke Mugswill called." 
               "Barbledook Swillbug!" repeated the black. 
               "Swillbug!"-swill nonsense!-Mugswill, of the Minories." 
               "De Binnories," repeated Pedro Alexiowitz, consulting his book; "hab not de honor ob your quaintance. You no find Massa 't'ome dis tree days. I tink Massa not 'ome" 
               "Don't know!" 
               Mugswill departed, and a moment afterwards his master's bell summoned the-negro. 
               "Who was that, Pedro?" 
               "Nobody dat know you honner, I think," 
               "Another time I desire to be apprized before you deny me." 
                
               And with this rebuke, Pedro sought his little pantry. 
               We must now follow Marmaduke Mugswill. 
               Arrived at the pier he cast a glance towards the offing, and there saw the Wasp dancing on the curling billow, as if impatient of the restraint of her anchor; and then he thought of her captain-and then of the court martial-and then of the pistol. 
               After viewing the Wasp for a short time, Mugswill ordered a boat and was soon in his way to the cutter. 
               When the boat neared the revenue vessel, Topman, who felt himself an object of very general suspicion, was leaning over her bulwarks, occupied by moody thought, and almost unconscious of what was passing before or around him, watching the sullen billows that washed the vessel's side, haply wishing he had power recal the act he had committed, when a hail of the vessel broke upon his reverie. 
               "Wasp, ahoy!" 
               Topman started-the hailing voice seemed familiar to him. 
               "What fiend," cried he "has sent him to torment me!" 
               And grasping the shrouds to prevent his falling on the deck, he remained looking on the approaching boat with an expression of horror. 
             
             
               CHAPTER IV. 
                
                  
                     "So winds the coiled serpent round his victim."
                   
                
               WHEN Watch discharged his pistol, the startled housebreakers beat a hasty retreat, but missed their footing, and rolled from the attic to the second floor, while the report of the fire-arm rousing the sleeping inmates, brought every person to the door of his or her apartment. 
               The man-lodger in the parlor seemed to be a cool hand, knowing that it was not usual to fire pistols in the middle of the night for joke'a sake alone, and hearing something heavy roll down stairs immediately after the report, thought the best way to ascertain the cause of the uproar would be to bolt the street door; to which he groped his way in the dark, while the landlady below was getting a light, and over and anon scolding the unconscious Billy. 
               "Take off the crape, I say; if yes have any hope for mercy!" cried watch, cocking his pistol. 
               "You needn't attack a man down," cried the theif, removing the mask that covered the upper part of his face, which was instantly recognised by the landlady, who exclaimed- 
               "It's you, Mr. Bill Somers, is it! Well, to be sure, I've often wondered where you got your money for the free and easies, seein' as you nevrr did no manner of work whatsumever. So this is the way you comes by your livin'. You ought to be hanged, you ought." 
               "Recollect, Marm, ther's law for all sorts in this country." 
               "What der yer mean by that, Mister Imperence! Mr. Trelawney would be only doing his duty in clearing the neighborhood of such fellers." 
               "Why, madam," observed Watch, after a moment's pause during which his mind presented all the inconvenience his prosecution of the burglars would involve, "Seeing I was so very near shooting the rubbish out of hand, I don't feel at prisent disposed to prosecute thim. And having shown their persons and pursuits to this goodly company, I see no very great harm in letting them both go away, upon their promise to thry to get a living by more honest manes in future." 
               The thieves having been ejected from the premises, the street door was bolted, and all parties retired to their respective rooms to sleep, if possible, until the morning. 
               Our hero meditated on the best means of not only getting Alexander M'What into his power but also the precise sum of money of which said Alexander M'What intended to rob the smugglers by betraying them to the excise. Without M'What's money, personal revenge would lose all its sweetness. 
               Having breakfasted and completed his toilette-having adjusted his wig, ochred his eye-brows, removed his enormous whiskers shaven and replaced them, he recovered his eye with the patch that made it sightless, to be perfectly in keeping with the Irish character, sallied from his den in search on for the scene of action. 
               Having succeeded in taking a house, he set himself about furnishing the lower part of it decently, a task which the contiguity of Moorfields at all time renders easy into such as have money in both pockets; and as he still debited M'What in his imagintion, he determined not to spare any expense on it; and, further, to suit his purpose he had two large recesses in the parlor fitted up as closets, intending to store up the goods therein for which he had sent to Farmer Welling. When the closets were completed, our smuggler, viewed them with a smile of approbation. 
               So far prepared to receive his enemy, which cost him the labor of some days, our hero sauntered down the line of way leading to Bishopsgate-without. 
               The smuggler turned down Winchester-street, until he emerged from the covert and found himself surrounded by children of commerce. 
               A few additional paces brought the bold smuggler within the demesnes of the counting-house he sought; and directed by the legible black letters, our hero, without further pause, proceeded to the first floor. 
               Gently knocking, he was answered by a shrill shrieking voice desiring him to come in, and pushing the door forward, which yielded readily to his hand, found himself confronted by a mahogany counter with brass standards and running curtains of green moreen, but by no living creature. He perceived a youth sitting at a desk within a foot of the ceiling. 
               "I have business with Mr. M'What young gentleman," said Will, counterfeiting the voice and manner of an Irishman. 
                
               "Mr. M'What is too importantly engaged to see much as you 
               "Faith, now, I'll tell that same to ould Mr. Pardo." 
               "To whom?" questioned the youth reddening. 
               "Mr. Jeremiah Pardo," replied Watch. 
               "I crave your pardon, sir," said the youth, "but I have here instructions to send any person from Mr. Pardo to Bedford-square the moment they arrive. I beg sincerely to apologize for my former rudeness." 
               No more time was wasted than suffered the youth to get a hackney coach, when, seated inside, our smuggler rattled over the streets of London. 
               Arrived at the door of M'What's house, in Badford-square, the youth directed the coachman to announce them. The door being opened, the youth jumped out of the coach, and then courteously awaited the descent of Watch. 
               "Is pa' at home, Markham?" said the youth, as soon as the latter personage opened the door. 
               "Yes, Master Henry," replied the footman. 
               "This way, sir," continued the footman, bowing to Watch. 
               And our hero entered the apartment, and sat himself down to wait until Mr. Alexander M'What would be pleased to permit him to work a miracle of diplomacy. 
               The disguised smuggler was not left long to ruminate alone ere Mr. Alexander M'What entered the room, displaying in his own proper person a peculiarity of the human genus, called by that portion of the world which penetrates no further than the surface, a very gentlemanly man, and known by the remainder which does, as a very rascally character. His person, which was not badly formed, carried a height of about five feet seven inches, and as he possessed the advantages of tolerable head of hair, dark eyes and a high forehead, with a mouth decently formed, he might have passed for a handsome man, had not nature, by way of drawback on these advantages of feature, imparted an air of closeness and cunning which led him to cultivate his countenance, training it to a perpetual smile, which he intended to serve the double purpose temper, from which the inexperienced might infer the very reverse of habitual dissimmulation. 
               M'What had long dealt with the smugglers of Welling's Hole through the medium of their general agent, the landlord of the "Three Jolly Anchorsmiths," nay, had grown rich by privately supplying the consumers of contraband articles in London. But there is a proverbial saying about a pitcher and a well, which at last found an application, and nearly reversed the fortunes of the hitherto lucky Scot. A valuable consignment of contraband materials being traced to his possession, it was seized, and the excise who had long kept M'What under surveillance, with a view of making him pay for old scores, had levied a mulct so considerable that it became a question between utter ruin and the betrayal of his coadjutor. The delinquency of old Pardo was well known to the blood-hounds of the excise, but he had hitherto contrived to baffle them: and M'What contrived to betray his old friend, and thus strike a deadly blow at the existence of the Kentish gang of smugglers, provided the government would remit his fine, and give him an appointment in the collection of the revenue he had so long been in the habit of defrauding: and so desirous were the commissioners of excise to entrap the man who had for so many years succeeded in setting them at defiance, that they had shown a dispositon to accept Mr. M'What's offer. 
               The cunning Scot, however, had not been inaugurated in his new dignity, which was to be no more than a sort of travelling commissioner for collecting informations in Kent and Sussex; in fulfilling the duties of which, from his long acquaintance with Pardo, he had little doubt of acquiring facts by which he might trace the ramifications of the extensive contraband connection with whom the ancient master of the "Three Jolly Anchorsmiths" appeared to be the only medium of communication. 
               But affairs of this kind are not carried out without precaution, though in this case, it was the precautionary measures adopted which led to the defeat of the whole plan. The commissioners felt it right to deliberate ere they saddled a man on the public service whom they considered in no other light than an adventurer, and whose only claim to confidence arose from betraying his former associates. They accordingly instructed Captain Trunnion to make due inquiries into the accuracy of certain details submitted, to enable them to judge whether M'What's employment would be followed by a favorable balance in the results. 
               This letter communicated to Watch in the unsuspicious hilarity of the table, enabled him to save the smugglers from the operation of a plan so extensive and well laid. Still the bare protection of his friends seemed but a poor revenge to the active spirit of Will Watch; and having had his resentment stirred once, nothing would satisfy him but the entire ruin of the villain who was plotting their destruction, and he longed with a stern longing to see M'What, defeated in his objects, become a begger in possession, a bankrupt in fame, and a miserable dupe of his intended victims. 
               When these two enemies sat for the first time in each other's presence, it would be difficult to say which felt the greatest degree of inward rejoicement: M'What that Pardo should have thus opportunely put himself into his power, or Will Watch to see the traitor he had come in search of almost within his reach: and he perused his features with a fierce and almost savage delight, as if he rejoiced in his utter hopelessness of means to disappoint the vengeance he had resolved on. M'What was the first to break the silence. 
               He-he-he?" said he with one of his best bows and most complaisant smiles. "Ye're recht weelcom to Badfe'd square. A ned na tell ye I hae bin fidgin fain till see old mister pardo himsal, wham I hope is recht weel, thoch I mun say ye com in amaist quiestiouable shape. It is nathless a recht gude coverin' for the business ye're come upon." 
                
               "Devil a disguise in it, at all," laughed Watch, with an equal degree of sincerity. "I'm just fhot I seem, man. I hope there's no harm in a body who had lost an eye in the defence of his counthry lookin after his own interest a little with the other." 
               "He-he-he!" said M'What-"very faceeshus-vary faceeshus, in deed!" 
               "By my sowl and you may say that;" returned the smuggler captain, "though p'rhaps ye mayn't like that fallows so well; for since I've bin admitted into the fraternity we do business for ready money only." 
               "Raddy money! hout-tout, the mon's clane daft! It's nae acuse Mr. Alexandir M'What has kippit a toon an kintra hoose, an a gilly in fire-colored breeks that he's aye capable O' commandin a pooer o"siller, Nae, nae, a ken whare its till be had an that's a". A'm a puir body mysal, very puir body in fac, but I've ken'd Mr. Pardo afore the day, and naver hard the mention o'raddy money atween us." 
               "Then by my sowl. Mr. M'What, it's time you should begin,-for on producing five thousand pounds I can furnish you with five thousand pounds' worth of material." 
               The prospect of so large a seizure made M'What's features light up with evident satisfaction; nevertheless he felt the matter required adroit management, for he had no wish, while playing game which should furnish government with an earnest of his zealous devotion to its interests, to play ducks and drakes with his own cash. 
               M'What, finding himself compelled to furnish the money beforehand, a condition never previously exacted during a long course of dealing with the octogenarian smuggler he was now about to betray, kept up the plea of poverty, and informed the disguised soldier he must be compelled to extend their confidence to a couple of trusty friends, through whom alone he could procure the means of payment; which being agreed on by his brother diplomat, it was arranged that a meeting should take place on the following night, at Watch's new house. 
               Now, when the smuggler had turned his back, M'What, alive to the consequences of permitting a single movement to go wrong, ringing for his great coat, put it on; and then concealing his face in a shawl neckerchief, and slouching his hat, left his house. He looked cautiously around him to be assured he was not watched. No person appeared near him; and, fully convinced he had gulled the Irish soldier, he hastened forward to the residence of an excise officer. The prospect of the easy capture of such a splendid prize was sufficient; and the latter promising his punctual attendance at the time and place appointed, with a brother officer, to make the capture certain, the treacherous M'What returned to Bedford-square in as stealthy a manner as he had left it. 
               Night came, and found punctual to the appointment, with decanters and glasses, and liquors, ready to meet and welcome the friends with whom he expected to deal on so large a scale. 
               They came-they were welcomed. M"What, on entering, cast his eyes around, hoping to see something indicating the rich booty he had designed for his two friends. A dead silence ensued-each seemed anxious that the other should begin 
               "Have you brought the money?" said Watch, at length. 
               "I-that is, thae gentlemin hae," returned M'What. 
               "Then let me see it's all right, and we'll go to business at wonst." 
               On which, notwithstanding these gentlemen had the money, M'What handed the pocket-book. 
               "'Tis all right," said Watch, examining the contents and then laying the pocket-book on the table; "let the money lay there till ye's have examined the goods, that's on'y conscionable." And raising the carpet, the smuggler removed a couple of boards and produced his richly-laden knapsack, which he opened, displaying to the glistening eyes of the officers its valuble contents. 
               "There are two thousand pounds worth," observed Watch, "and the rest you shall have in two days, if I find I'm dealing with men of honor." 
               The sight of the prize was the signal for action. M'What snatched up the pocket book, while the officers laid hands on the knapsack, exclaiming in a single breath- 
               "We seize this in the King's name." 
               "Sure, gintlemen, ye's never mane that," exclaimed Watch. Och! it's a jokin' ye's are, entirely. Such a thing 'ud be my ruin, for those closets are filled with contraband articles equally liable to seizure." 
               "We are glad to hear it!" cried M'What and the officers, advancing towards the closet, when the doors were suddenly thrown open, and Watch's boat's crew, pistol in hand rushed out and captured the informer and his companions. 
             
             
               CHAPTER V. 
                
                  
                      
                        We still have judgement, here, which we but teach 
                        Bloody instructions, that being taught return 
                        To plague th' inventor. Even-handed Justice 
                        Returns th' ingredient of the poisoned chalice 
                        To our own lips-- 
                     
                   
                
               THE re-appearance of Marmaduke Mugswill upon the scene, and his peculiarly inquisitive disposition angured no good to Topman; nay, convinced him his hope of secrecy and safety was but a shadow, and that, indeed, the cry of blood had ascended, and the murdered man spoken with "most miraculous organ,"-which, echoed by his conscience was powerful enough to stir the sand upon which he had founded the assurance of his future life. 
               He now painfully felt his existence depended on the breath of another other; and, had he the means to perpetrate the act in secrecy, would have purchased his own safety by adding the murder of the commoncouncilman unto the catalogue of his crimes. 
               It is not wonderful, therefore, that on hearing the hail and distinguishing the person in the approaching boat, whose appearance he had greatest reason to dread, the sudden and tumultuous rush of his feelings almost overcame him. 
               But the mind of Topman was cast in no ordinary mould, and, guilty as he was, he towered in his guilt far beyond the pusallanimity that shrinks and cowers under the threatening consequences of its own sets. 
               With Topman it was "tug and tug" to the last," and, although he had, for a moment, given way to sudden surprise, he soon rallied sufficient courage to stare his enemy full in the face, as if he had never seen him before,-a trick of policy which judging from his countenance, puzzled the common-councilman, and almost led him to doubt the identity of the seaman before him. 
               Having been informed, in answer to his hail, that Captain Trunnion was ashore, he at once desired them to turn the boat's head landward, determined yet to seek a communication with that officer on the subject he had so much at heart: and in so doing he was merely pursuing a natural instinct, or weakness, or foible, equally unaccountable to himself and others, acting from an occult propulsion indigenous to his inquisitive temper. 
               Again on terra firma, Marmaduke Mugswill immediately made way towards the elevated line of buildings which overlook Ramsgate pier and harbor, and summoning Pedro by his usual elaborate appeal upon the knocker, looked a thousand dignities while the subservient black informed him that he was to be shown up. 
               Nevertheless, as the negro ushered Marmaduke Mugswill into Captain Trunnion's presence, he could not help stealing a glance at the burly figure of the man in drab, as if doubting prudence of his master's orders; and he opened and shut the drawing room door with-many inward misgivings that the captain would have to repent of not having followed his advice, and kept so suspicious-looking a person at a more convenient distance. 
               Captain Trunnion, who was sitting alone when Mugswill entered the drawing-room, rose to receive the grotesque apparition who had done him the honor of a call-looking, at the same time, inquiringly into his face, as if half inclined to believe he really belonged to the class and order in which his zealous valet had already assigned him a place. 
               "I am Marmaduke Mugswill," said the stranger. 
               "Sir!" exclaimed the Captain. 
               "I live in the Minories!" 
               "Well, sir?" 
               "I hold the honorable office of common-councilman for my ward in the city, and am therefore entitled to be considered a respectable character." 
               Captain Trunnion stared at Mugswill, as if he entertained some doubt of his sanity. The latter, however, proceeded. 
                
               "I have made it a point to announce my name, residence, and the honorable occupation I hold, because I dislike ambiguities. We will now, if you please, moot the question that brings me here." 
               "Will you please to be seated?" said the Captain. 
               "I will," returned Mugswill; "I will, Captain Trunnion, for the business I wish to see you upon will occupy some time; nor do I think the time lost which leads to a good purpose." 
               And taking off the drab great coat and worsted comforter which had caused so many misgivings as to his character, the eccentric common-councilman sat himself in a large easy chair with as much complacent dignity as if he had been Lord Mayor. 
               "You have lately lost a man, Captain Trunnion," said he, with a grin that shewed him perfectly at home. 
               "I have," replied the Captain. 
               Supposed to have been murdered?" 
               "It is so." 
               "The murder," continued Mugswill, taking out his pocket-book, "is thought to have been perpetrated on -- of October, at night, upon a cliff between Ramsgate and Broadstairs." 
               "I crave your silence, Captain," said Muggswill, with mysterious gravity; "an ancient philosepher tells us, the man who would acquire wisdom should keep his mouth shut, and his ears open." 
               "Go on, sir," said the Captain, impatiently; "I fear your wisdom will prove of little service here." 
               "Well," observed the imperturbable Mugswill, "let that depend upon the event. A preventive-service man named Topman has had a court-martial held on him for this fact." 
               "He has, and has also been acquitted.' 
               "Without a reserved point?" 
               "Yes; he was fully acquitted; and the court was justified in coming to that conclusion." 
               "That was somewhat precipitate," observed the common-councilman gravely; "for I have every reason to believe that Topman was the actual murderer of his shipmate, Hardbrace"-- 
               "Why do you presume to say so?" 
               "One question more-I will inform you." 
               "Go on!" 
               "Can you tell me the number on the murdered man's firearm?" 
               "It was nine." 
               "The very number," quoth Mugswill. "I have now no doubt upon the subject." 
               With the greatest affectation of modesty and humility, and the customary prefacial abandonment of all pretension to superior acumen or penetration, usually intended to prepare the auditor for some extraordinary ebullition of ability, the common-councilman now proceeded to detail the circumstances he had to communicate, stating with minute verbosity the fact of his having found a pistol, numbered nine, upon the sands between Ramsgate and Broadstairs, on the morning following the suspected murder; his interview with Topman at the Old Ship; and his surrender of the firearm in question to the preventive-service man, &c., to all which the master and commander listened with a degree of interest that marked the importance he attached to Mugswill's relation, chiding himself at the same time, for having yielded to the importunities of his former favorite, and instituted an inquiry by court-martial, regarding him now as a double traitor. 
               When the common-councilman had finished, Captain Trunnion regretted that although he entertained no doubt, after the narrative he had heard, that Topman was not only guilty of the murder of his shipmate, but that he was also in league with the smugglers who had so long contrived to elude the vigilance of the men under his command, he had no individual power to interfere, and therefore left the inquisitive Londoner to suggest any course he thought likely to bring the delinquent to punishment. 
               Left thus to the spider-like ingenuity of his own mind, Marmaduke Mugswill devoted himself to the work he had undertaken, with a skill and determination which might, perhaps, in a Taunton and a Lavender, have drawn down universal applause, proceeding to the place where the unfortunate Hardbrace had kept watch with his brother preventive, accompanied by two parish officers to corroborate any fact which might arise out of his voluntary labor. The common-councilman examined everything with a minuteness and precision which shewed he was admirably fitted for the task he had undertaken. 
               The remaining wood-ashes of the beacon-light that Topman sat up to warn the smugglers in the offing all was safe, were before him, together with the burnt and discolored earth underneath and around them. But although the persevering investigator could make nothing more than ordinary of these appearances, he raked the ashes over and over again, as if he would attempt impossibilities rather than fail in connecting a single link in the chain of circumstances, on which so much would depend. 
               But, as the Swan of Avon sweetly singeth-"There is a providence that shapes our ends, rough-hew them as we will:" and, as if the cry of blood were always responded by the wonder-working voice of heaven, speaking in the soul's deep silence, a small piece of charred wood, placed accidentally on a leverage pressed by Mugswill with the little stick be used to stir the ashes, sprang up, and projected itself about three feet in advance, falling at the foot of the knoll on which Ned Topman sat to unload his pistol after having perpetrated the murder. 
               Acting on a natural superstition, which, in spite of advancing knowledge, still obtains and is as rife in the present day as when the bard before quoted wrote- 
                      
                        In my school days, when I had lost one shaft 
                        I shot his fellow of the self-same flight, 
                        The self-same way, with more advised watch, 
                        To find the other forth. 
                     
                   Mugswill, seizing the omen, pursued the direction of the charred wood, and discovered a bullet and pistol-wadding, while traces of ignited powder were visible in a black line about a foot in length, towards the root of the grass, as if a small train had been exploded near the spot. 
               Eagerly drawing the attention of his companions to a fact to which he, experienced in such matters, attached a degree of importance that under other circumstances had been truly ludicrous, Mugswill proceeded to the hand-rail, upon which he detected and exhibited certain marks, as if it had been scraped with a knife, raking the grass immediately underneath for any debris of wood which might thicken the circumstances so as to eventuate the discovery of the murder; while his more simple companions, not so corrupted by the vices incidental to a metropolitan residence, held up their hands and eyes in astonishment, and looked upon every discovery as the result of a wisdom almost supernatural, and regarded the common-councilman with an admiration nearly amounting to awe. 
               After picking up and examining many pieces of loose earth, mingled with the grains and scrapings of the half-decayed hand-rail, Mugswill's eyes brightened with evident satisfaction. 
               He thought he had discovered a link leading to a positive conclusion on the subject, nor did he now entertain a doubt of Topman's guilt. 
               "Look here!" cried he, exultingly to his companions, holding up a jagged chip that Timothy Clark in his eagerness to cleanse the hand-rail had torn off, and exhibiting it. 
               "It's only an old chip!" observed the witnesses. 
               "An old chip is it!" exclaimed the quick-sighted common-councilman. "Such an old chip as this would go far to hang a man under suspicious circumstances, if tried before a London jury." 
               The two witnesses looked astounded. To their obtuse faculties the article produced was a chip, and nothing more; but Mugswill, whose investigative temper connected all things, thought he could make a great deal more of it-not was he mistaken. 
               "Look!" observed he, directing their attention to a dark incrustation on it, "Do you not perceive this is a foreign substance?" 
               "A foreign substance!" echoed they, wondering what he would assert next. 
               "I do not mean," said Mugswill, manifesting a degree of impatience at their dullness of comprehension, 
               "I do not mean that the wood was grown abroad; but that the matter encrusted on it is not earth, neither has it arisen altogether from atmospheric damp, bearing, to my thinking, every appearance of decayed animal matter-such as blook in a putrescent state. I do not positively say it is so-it is a matter that requires investigation, and as such, assumes a feature of importance. And now I bethink me, when I discovered the pistol upon the beach below, I perceived a rag of silk appended from an excrescence growing out of the cliff; thither I think it is most important we should repair, in order that we, my friends, my perfect the charge given into our direction." 
               His companions, who, indeed, had no experience in such cases, gave a ready acquiescence, when Mugswill, after pondering for a moment, deemed it necessary, while yet the circumstances were fresh upon their minds, to take down an accurate description of the place and manner of the finding, which he did with the greatest exactness, directing their attention to the most minute particulars, and then proceeded, by the nearest way of access, to finish the examination on the sands. 
               When Mugswill and his companions descended to the beach, there, as he had previously stated, still hung the identical piece of black silk. A ladder was immediately procured, and this further piece of evidence mastered; and most important was it, being no other than the neckerchief of the root growing out of the cliff, a species of samphire, and there hung when its unfortunate owner was precipitated in to the deep. 
               The establishment of this important circumstance, leading, as it did, to the inevitable conclusion that Hardbrace had been unfairly dealt with, amply repaid the toil of the persevering common-council-man. 
               No doubt could exist of the ownership; it was marked with his initials within a worked heart, and was the gift of a young woman in Sheerness, to whom the murdered man was to have been married. The whole crew of the Wasp knew it as well as they knew their respective messes-and our forefather's wisdom is sufficient to inform us that the beggar knows his dish. Wherefore, the self-applauding Mugswill, filled with the most extravagant notions of his own sense, a wisdom he conceived almost miraculous when contrasted with the powers of those who filled the parochial situations in Ramsgate, tied up the several articles he had discovered in the neckerchief of the murdered seaman. and followed by the parish authorities to bear evidence to the finding, took his way to Captain Trunnion's residence. 
               But if the common-councilman's self applause had already half choked him, the extravagant encomium of Captain Trunnion swelled his lungs to a degree that threatened suffocation. He indeed felt what it is to be painfully flattered, for, added to his own estimate, which had already overpaid his exertions, the Captain's praises proved almost too much for his brain. Yet, flattered though he were, the habitual deprecation of desert he had acquired by speaking at folk and wardmote formed an odd contrast with the self complacency and ridiculous triumph which manifested themselves by the most curious distortions of his features, notwithstanding every effort he made to entirely control them. 
               The captain of the Wasp, who, however well qualified for the quarter-deck, like the king-making earl of old, had but small pretension to judgment in the "nice-cut quillets of the law," left the arrangements necessary to elucidate the mysterious affair to the guidance and direction of the person under whom the investigation had so auspiciously begun, promising his own co-operation, in purse and person, to aid in bringing the criminal to condign punishment. Mugswill, thus authorised, proceeded without delay in the initiative measures, by carring the parish officers who had accompanied him before the nearest district magistrate, to whom he stated the facts. 
               A quorum was formed on the day following and assembled at the Captain's house; before which Mugswill and his companion deposed to finding the articles produced, the neckerchief of the missing seaman discolored with blood having been identified by a whole boat's crew as having belonged to their shipmate Hardbrace. 
               Captain Trunnion deposed to the ward being kept on the night of the murder jointly with Topman, and also to the number on the fitearm picked up by Mugswill, and delivered over by that person on a false representation of ownership, to be the same as the number on the weapons of Hardbrace. The magistrates demanded the presence of the suspected preventive who was immediately ordered ashoer. 
               We have said that Topman's nerves were well strung, and though the deed he had to mask is revolting to all human sympathy, right well did he sustain himself amid the desperate circumstances by which he was hemmed in. The reappearance of Mugswill had given sufficient warning that the false security he had attained was about to receive a shock which would require all his presence of mind to meet, repel, or turn aside. Hardbrace's weapon he knew could not be produced-and he also knew until that was produced nothing more than the unsubstantiated statement of the London common councilman could come against him. The staunch conduct of Timothy Clarke before the court-martial had given him earnest he was safe in his dependence on that person; and that the testimony of any other could cause him harm seemed an idea altogether preposterous. 
               But Ned had yet to learn the discoveries made by the ingenious Londoner. He as yet knew nothing of the neckerchief, nor the stained chip, nor the pistol wadding, nor the bullet. These circumstances were to come suddenly before him-circumstances it was as impossible to preclude as to avoid, and therefore requiring the coolest efforts of reason to control. 
               When, therefore, Topman received orders to come ashore, it is little wonder that his stern features underwent a sudden change, or that his face should become pale, or that a convulsive movement should be perceived about his cheeks and lips. It was, however, but momentary; and as he descended the vessel's side not a sinew of his powerful frame gave indication of a quailing spirit, and he stood in the stern-thwarts with as much calmness as if he had been summoned on a pleasing duty. 
               Arrived at the Captain's Topman was ordered up to the drawing-room, in which he found Captain Trunnion, two magistrates and Marmaduke Mugswill. The preventive man started as he entered, evidently surprised that proceedings jad assumed a form so judicial; but recovering himself, he bowed to his captain, and then calmly looked at the magistrates, without appearing to recognize any other person. 
               Do you recognize no person in this apartment?" questioned the senior magistrate. 
               "My captain-as a matter of course." 
                
               "No one else?" questioned the magistrate. 
               "None!" sturdily repeated Topman. 
               "Is it possible you do not recollect me!" asked Mugswill, amazed by the hardihood and cunning of the suspected preventive man-which he deemed something more than natural. 
               "Recollect!" repeated Topman; "that would be impossible in a person who had never seen you before." 
               "And you--" said the common-councilman. 
               "Have never seen you before." 
               "We shall put that assertion to the test," and Mugswill; "there is one person in Ramsgate who can bear testimony to our interview. He shall be sent for." 
               "May he not mistake me for another person?" 
               Ringing for a servant, Mugswill immediately despatched a messenger to the landlonrd, Grubenstein, requesting his immediate attendance-and then turning to the magistrates, proceeded- 
               "In the meantime, we can, if you please, go on with the evidence you have already before you." 
               "Edward Topman," said the senior magistrate, addressing the prisoner with a severe and searching look, "It is only justice I should inform you that you stand charged with a heinous offence, no other than the murder of your shipmate and fellow preventive, Henry Hardbrace, and that we have already sufficient evidence to warrant our committing you for trial. It is a charge most heinous. We have heard from the evidence of Captain Trunnion that you were on the watch with him. 
               "Good heavens! is that a reason to suspect me?" 
               "Silence, sir!" 
               "Why, your honors, should I be silent on a charge affecting my life?" asked the accused preventive, with an undaunted and self-possessed air, which, notwithstanding the suspicious circumstances, created a sensation in his favor. 
               "His honor there knows I have already been arraigned for this, and honorably acquitted by court-martial." 
               "You will shortly have to answer before a jury for the crime," observed the magistrate; which will, no doubt, bestow every proper attention to the evidence which has convinced us." 
               "Then I shall stand a poor chance of justice," interrupted Topman sturdily; "at present your manifest prejudice in hearing evidence in my absence convinces me I have little lenity to hope for." 
               "Did you show lenity to the murdered man?" 
               "This is condemning me, unheard?" 
               "Murder has been committed." 
               "What motive could I have for such an act?" 
               "I am not here to inquire into motives, but to decide on facts. 
               The ringing of the house-bell now announced the return of the servant who had been sent to the landlord of the Old Ship; and the effect produced on the accused preventive was observed by all. 
               His contenance, previously flushing by rage and vexation, assumed a deadly paleness; and his nerve, which had hitherto commanded by strong mental control, suddenly to leave him altogether: a tremulous motion agitated the muscles of his face, and communicated its effects through every fibre of his powerful frame; his courage had given way under the prospective evidence of Grubenstein, and, gasping from the effects of deep emotion, he caught at a chair-back to prevent falling. 
               "What is the matter, prisoner?" questioned the senior magistrate. 
               "I am ill, sir-not guilty," was the reply. 
               "Hand him a glass of brandy," said the captain. 
               "I thank your honor," observed the accused preventive, drinking it and partially himself; "it was only a sudden spasm. I am occasionally troubled with them-I am better now." 
               As the girl, upon whose announcement so much seemed to depend, approached the table, the accused preventive man shuddered; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands until his sinews swelled into semblances of thick wire, in his endeavour to surpress his nervous irritation, and the blood could be distinctly seen, near the temples rising and falling like peas, as the arter struggled to prevent too violent a propulsion of the circulating fluid into the more minute vessels that feed and nourish the brain. 
               His violent agitation could no longer be cencealed; he felt that every eye in the room was fixed upon him, and that constructions threatening to his safety would de placed upon emotions over which he had lost all power; neither did he dare longer to trust his eye to look upon the array against him, and, averting his gaze, and breathing in short and silence and half-surpressed breathings, he turned slowly, sternly on that of the maiden, and prepared to hear the worst. 
               A fearful silence reigned for a moment. 
               "Mr. Grubenstein is dead!" said the girl. 
               Poor Grubenstein, who had panted through many years of his race towards the goal we all start for, reaching it that morning; for, having swallowed a double allowance of the liquor he loved, he was seized with a sudden fit of coughing, which, removing for instant the pressure that hitherto prevented the collapse of his lungs, he closed his account after a vain endeavor to cast it up and died because he could not pant any longer, ending his vegetable existence very much to Topman's satisfaction and his own. 
               But though this fact enabled the preventive-man to recover his presence of mind, he little thought what mischief another circumstance was preparing, or that while he was congratulating himself on having so happily escaped being identified by the common-councilman, the report on board the revenue vessel of Hardbrace's neckerchief having been discovered soaked through with blood should have rendered the hitherto prudent Timothy Clarke somewhat incontinent of speech; but that individual, anxious to clear Topman, whom he verily believed, told the story of the nasal bleeding, and of his having assisted in cleansing the handrail, together with the other circumstances already narrated to the reader, the which having been reported to the lieutenant on board, that officer took upon himself the trouble to examine the foremast-man mast-man, and finally sent him ashore for further examination on a charge of being accessory after the fact-a circumstance which the luckless Timothy could not comprehend, and which, perchance, might have puzzled a wiser head than his own, seeing there was as yet no direct or certain evidence of any fact having been committed. 
               Sustained by the opportune occurrence of Grubenstein's death, Topman met the questions on the neckerchief and other suspicious circumstances, collected together by the perseverance of the common-councilman, by declaring his total ignorance on the matter. He had even the hardihood to impute to Mugswill the fabrication of the charges for some private malevolence he could not fathom; and that the latter must have known the fact of Grubenstein's death ere he had ventured to call on him to corroborate what had never occurred; arguing the matter so soberly, and with such an appearance of solemnity and truth, that the magistrates themselves began to waver in their decision, and Marmaduke Mugswill cast his eyes hither and thither in evident astonishment at the cool and quiet impudence of the accused. 
               In the midst of his speech, however, another violent ringing at the bell disturbed the company. Topman started, shrewdly conjecturing that some new trick of circumstance had occurred to cross his efforts at safety. The proceedings stood critically balanced: it was "night or the Prussians" with him-but neither came to his assistance; for while every eye was turned towards the door, the entrance of Timothy Clarke put an end to all hopes of safety, and the examination of that individual having been read over, both seamen were committed unto Maidstone gaol to the following assizes, and conveyed for present custody, to the cage, wherein they stood, waiting a cross-country conveyance, Ned Topman, stern, silent and determined, contemplating the various chances of escape, and calculating how to use them, and the sapient and philosophical Timothy Clarke walking from side to side of his prison, and occasionally ejaculating. "Well, I'm blest!" 
               But the daring and desperate smugglers of Welling's Hole were not likely to permit a man so useful to their fraternity as Ned Topman to be conveyed to prison without some resistance; and Welling, calling his confederates together, left it for their consideration to attempt a rescue. Few arguments were used; nay, few were necessary. Each knew the danger he incurred by leaving the preventive man in his present jeopardly-a rescue was resolved on-and thought, with desperate man, acquires the rapidily of action. 
               As evening approached, the prisoners were placed in the bottom of a cart, and removed from Ramsgate under the escort of the two parish officers and a brace of hands from abroad, in case resistance should be offered. The moon rising early, they started on their way to the main road beneath the silver deity of night, to which the hushed breath of nature seemed paying adoration. Nothing disturbed the silence except the occasional laugh of the escort, who, undreaming of danger, called on mirth to enliven their tedious journey. 
               But as little wist these unthinking men how soon their mirth was to be followed by a deed of blood, as that a party of Topman's most daring ing associates lay in wait for them, silent, remorseless, and determined of purpose. The coarse jests of the two sailors went round, and the boisterous laughter that followed, triumphing over the stillness of the night, reached the ears of a dozen stout smugglers who watched behind a clump of trees in Billing's Lodge Field. 
               "They are coming, lads! be steady!" said Farmer Welling in a deep whisper, as if afraid, even at that distance, to convey an intimation to their approaching victims. 
               Every man looked to his priming, and put his musket on the cock. 
               A minute had scarcely elapsed, when the cart appeared descending a hill, at about three hundred yards distance, Spunyun, in the height of his jollity at having a land cruise, giving vent to his humor in a loud song. 
               "Hold yourself ready, boys," whispered Welling. "We are more than enow for the men if they resist, and if the horse give us the go-by, we fail altogether." 
               "Never fear, farmer, we'll not fail!" 
               "Make ready!" 
               "Aye, aye!" 
               "Remember, lads!" whispered the farmer through his clenched teeth-"down with the horse! Ned Topman must be rescued." 
             
             
               CHAPTER VI. 
                
                  
                     "Yes, in good sooth, smuggling's a vice of great kindred: it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking are all put down."
                   
                
               THE sudden rush of Will Watch's boat's crew, whom Farmer Welling had caused stealthily to be conveyed to London, agreeably to our hero's desire, completely paralyzed M'What and his companions, and rendered them an easy capture; and in the midst of the most triumphant security, they found themselves suddenly prisoners to the man they were plotting to betray, surrounded by armed and ferocious men, whose fierce demeanor seemed to threaten death should they make any attempt to alarm the neighborhood. 
               The custom-house officers preserved the dogged silence that characterizes Englishmen under defeat, overpowered by numbers, yet incapable of saying, I yield. M'What, on the other hand, seemed painfully alive to the terrors of his situation; he felt that his contemplated treachery was beyond forgiveness, and seeing the smuggler with means at hand to execute any vengeance he might think proper, gave himself up for lost: he writhed in his chair with inward horror, cowering under the steady and determined look of Watch, who, with his levelled pistol, stood commanding his eye within two paces distance; 'till, unable to bear the painful agony of the pause that followed their capture -which had not lasted more than a minute-the Scotsman, with a cold shudder, covered his face with his hands, as if endeavoring to shut out a consciousness of the fate that seemed to threaten him. 
               "I nid na ax for quarter," said he at length summoning courage to speak; "yet I would say its nae recht to kill pipple in cool blood, an' after the strife is over; ye ken it's what folks ca' bloodgu'ltiness." 
               "An f oht quarter can 'ye's pretend to, who, wid victh'ry an yer side, 'ud give us none; but 'ud think ye's wor on'y doin' yer duty though ye's ruined a hunthred families by yer rascality?" asked Watch. 
               "I'll no say, but I'll be content wi' ony quarter ye're disposed to gie till us: for ye ken weel, Mr. Trelawney, ye hae a' the power on your side; an' that confers a muckle deal o' rect," returned the Scot. 
               "And f hot can ye's hope?" demanded Watch. 
               "In the first place I sincerely hope you will take no life!" replied M'What. 
               "An f hot's life?" asked the smuggler, with a contemptuous look. 
               "Why I'll no pretend to define such a mystery in a ganeral way; but as far as consarns my personal and peculiar self, it wad be to breathe possibly a few years longer, happily to repint o' my sins in the gross, and more especially o' the sin that I contemplated agin so ganerous a foe-like as Mr. Muldowny Trelawney." 
               "And are ye wake enough to believe," demanded our smuggler, "that such gross flattery could desave the man who desaved the man who desaved ye when he read the mantling triumph in yer thrathrus eyes, as ye gloated over the gains you would make by this night's work? Sure, Mister Pardo tould me of the base bargain ye had made with the government." 
               "Mister Pardo mun be the diel till hae ken'd it!" exclaimed old M'What. 
               "Ye don't deny the fact, then?" cried Watch, cocking his pistol, and bringing it to bear upon the cowering figure of his treacherous friend, while he looked with a cold and glassy look on his half-recumbent half-retracted body, and smiled with a contemptuous smile, as if he marvelled to see so much fear of what must be inevitable' "ye don't deny the fact?" 
               "Mind I neither affirm nor deny it," cried M'What in alarm, "so dinna kill me on that account, or ye'll be guilty o' downright murder, an' that's an awfu' thing to have upon a man's conscience." 
               Watch laughed bitterly. 
               "Ye may weel laugh," exclaimed M'What; "ye're justified in sic like a mirthful disposition by bein' o' the recht side of the hedge. Gin ye fill'd my side o' the picture ye wad na find it sic a laugnin' matter I ken." 
               "Coward!" exclaimed Watch. 
               The Scotsman blushed with shame and anger; but a glance round the room convinced him of the utter impossibility of attempting resistance, and he recovered his equanimity. 
               "Co'ard is a hard word under a' circumstances, Mr. Trelawney," said he. 
               "What price will you redeem your wretched carcase at?" 
                
               "I'll no quarrel wi' terms, an' yours are preceesely corract," returned M'What with bitterness. "Yes, sir, you are quite correct; for it must be a very wretched carcase when a price is put on till it." 
               "Did you not fairly buy those goods?" demanded Watch, pointing to the knapsack which had been dropped by one of the officers in the beginning of the fray. 
               M'What, however he might prize his life, had no wish to be saddled with and pay for a seizable commodity in the presence of officers empowered to take possession of it; and readily divining the smuggler's intention was to take his money and then turn the tables on him by exposing him, to suffer the penalties of the revenue law, replied- 
               "I'll no say that I sinsarely intended on'y sic like thing. It is ane thing till talk, an' anither to bind the bargain. Gin ye clack for a month you'll never clench a nail wi' a breath; an' words are on'y wind unless they are bund by the siller. Nae siller has yet passit atween us, Mr. Trewlawney; an' as ye hae gotten the bird out o' the jaws o' the hawk, ye can just keep it yersel' tull ye cum by a better customer; and ye'll no fare waur gin ye gang a wee bit further I trow." 
               "Do you, then, deny having purchased it?" demanded Watch, threatening. 
               "I'll no deny ony thing," replied the Scot; "Ony I hae muckle use for it at present; an' its hard saddlin' a dealer wi' a thing he has no immediate wish until." 
               "Do not think to save the paltry lucre I bade ye bring with ye," cried Watch; "or, that, after having plotted my destruction and the destruction of my friends, I will leave you in possession of the ill-gotten wealth you have amassed from the labors of honester men than yorself. Produce the pocket-book." 
               "I'll no say, but ye hae the power to command the like o' that or ilk ither thing ye desire," observed M'What, slowly dipping his hand into his coat pocket until he reached the bottom, eyeing the smuggler at the same time with a catlike regard; he retracted it cautiously, exclaiming, as he cleared the pocket, "Ye shall hae the book, and I hope its contents 'ill do nobody harm." 
               The Scotchman presented a pistol, and his thumb was on the hammer to bring it to a cock, when Delaware Dick, who stood behind M'What's chair, watching every motion with the eye of a lynx, struck him on the wrist so heavily that the woapon fell from his powerless hand, exclaiming, at the same time- 
               "No lub to see pipple fool enough to play bid pire-arm." 
               "Fhot do ye desarve now?" demanded Watch." 
               "Nae mair than I expect," returned M'What, his courage rising to an equality with the occasion; "for I'll no deny that had I drawn the trigger, ye wad na stan' where ye do at the prasant." 
               "And fhot do you expect?" 
               "Death." 
               "Fool, to thrame of sich a thing!" exclaimed Watch; "death is an exemption from sufferings, and thine, are about to begin. No! thy present death would pay the debt too quickly for my vengeance;" then turning to the black, he continued, "s'arch his person and master his arms, lest Le again attimpt murder, and give me the pocket-book; do you hear, Delaware?" 
               "Yas, yas, massa skipper, I hear bery bell; I'b do dep," cried the negro, and continued, turning to the astonished Scot," "you better turn ebery ting out sabe me de trubble; come barba han, bill ye?" 
               Thus urged, the unwilling Scot proceeded to unburthen his pockets; Delaware Dick, however, observing he missed one, exclaimed- 
               "Both hab oo got in dat oder quoat pocket?-not in dat, in de oder pocket? Shall I 'sist ye, ha?" and he thrust his brawny hand to the bottom of the suspected pocket; "bigor, misser, I dink dis be notin alse bot de guzzon-charman ob de bub-dog I knock down jis now Why did oo kip dis back, oo bastanagger varmint?" concluding, as he produced the other pistol, "am apeard dere is not trittin ob like gentleman-too shickery por dat, bigor." 
               "And now, gintlemin," cried Watch, addressing the captured officers, "I regret my own safety compels me to lay a greater restraint on your personal freedom than I would under other circumstances. You will be rel'ased to-morrow morning; and remember to proceed immadiately to M'What's house in Badford-square; you will find the knapsack there before ye's 'ull be paid for your thrubble, and by the scoundrel who has broken through a connexion of years to turn informer." 
               "I tak' ye all to watness the gudes are nat mine," cried M'What, turning towards his quondam companions; "and that if the money whilk is taken for 'em be mine, it is a forcit barg'in, din under a compulsion, and no bindin' on ony body. I tak' ye a' to watness this, an that I hereby purtest agen any designed cheat o' his Majesty's revenue." 
               "Scoundrell" cried Watch, "think not to avail yourself of a protest; your house, your holding, all your ill-gotten wealth, will I place to-morrow in the hands of a government you have so often defrauded." 
               "All' wha talks o' fraud new?" returned the Scot; "it's jist a am wi' Sathan bearing testimony agen sin; a cheat-the-gallows smuggler to babble on thic gait o' defraudin the government to a mon o' substance like mysel." 
               "A man of substance!" echoed Watch, losing all assumption of character in the excitement of the moment; "if you be a man of substance, less reason have you to commit the fraud than those you would betray; substance! whence have you derived it, if not from the labors of brave hearts, who dare uncertain days, tempestuous nights, iron shot and pointed steel, with a terrible death should the oppressor succeed in his seizure. From these, and such as these, have you amassed your store of wealth; and by these, and such as these, shall you become as barren as the bare hills in your native country-you, and your children, and your children's children." 
               In this dilemma the Scotsman directed a look towards the custom-house officers, as if to bespeak commiseration; but in their countenances nothing could be found save their satisfaction in the prospect of the next day's seizure. Amongst them the question who suffers 
                   
                     THE SMUGGLERS ARREST 
                   was never thought on, and it was immaterial whether Alexander M'What, or Muldowney Trelawney were the victim-so they could arrive at so rich a spoil they little recked though they wrecked everything. The despairing look of M'What, therefore, produced little effect on their indurated feelings. Whether the bargain were forced upon him or not; two things were certain-one, that the goods were contraband-the other, that M'What stood not in the best of odours with their employers. 
               Failing to find sympathy in this quarter, he turned his eyes upon the rough-looking men into whose power he had fallen; but the idea of hope was lost in the surliness of expression that governed their hard and weather-beaten features. Willing still to flatter himself, he sought for hope in the recesses of his own heart, but the consciousness of his intended treachery forbade it. Placed in this forlorn condition, he lay at the mercy of his enemies, fearing to look upon the worst, yet not daring to anticipate a better destiny, and in this benumbed and torpid state abode the decision of his captor. 
               Will Watch having ceased to speak to the treacherous Scot addressed dressed himself to the smugglers, who stood over the captured officers, ready to execute any order he might give, desiring them to search their prisoners-a manuvre which they executed with an adroitness that showed them fully capable of changing characters with the excisemen. Having ascertained they had no instrument to cut their cord asunder, the smuggler captain directed them to be tied back to back in the kitchen, with liberty of arm sufficient to enable them to take refreshments, of which he ordered them an ample supply, promising to set them free in the morning; and at the same time promising a brace of pistol bullets through their heads should they attempt to give alarm until he authorized their release. 
               Necessity renders the mandate of a smuggler or corsair despotic; it will not be deemed marvellous, therefore, that the sturdy fellows who had laid hands on the officers, unceremoniously thrust them out of the room on hearing their captain's order, betraying so little respect for his Majesty's authority as to leave some doubt whether the presence of his Majesty's self could have exercised a controlling influence. Rid of the officers, the smuggler turned to his quondam ally. 
               "You have a family." he observed. 
               M'What started, and his eyes half filled with tears. 
               "Eh mon," cried he, "What maun they suffer an' ye gang on the gait ye ha' begun wi'?" 
               "You can feel then?" 
               "Ye ken everything feels for its ain" 
               "And yet ye could doom other families to suffer?" 
               "They were neither kith nor kin o' mine," exclaimed the Scot, "or I might hae found some compasslon for them: ye'll no think I hae na' the feeling o' a feyther about me." 
               Watch looked at his enemy with a look of solemn earnestness that roused the fears of the wretched man. 
               "Alexander M'What," said he, "you forfeited your life by treacherous dealing." 
               "Eh, mon!" cried the quailing Scot, "but ye'll nae kill me?" 
               "Kill thee!" repeated the smuggler disdainfully. 
               "Yas," interposed M'What; "it wad be a'thegither barbarous when ye ken ye hae taen with the strong arm o' power, spoil o' weapon, an' spoil o' purse, and I hae nae langer means o' makin' defence agen ye." 
               "Dream not of death, Alexander M'What; with you my vengeance shall be slow and deliberate, even as the baseness you contemplated against my friends. Is not this just?" 
               "I'll na say that it is or it is not; but I ken weel that it is nae likely to he vary marciful gin a mon judge by your eye, whilk is nae one o' the blenching anes." 
               "Do you think you deserve mercy?" asked the smuggler 
               This was a direct question, and as neither a diplomat nor a Scotsman answers a direct question directly, it gave M'What an opportunity of in part extenuating his conduct, and endeavouring to turn the smuggler's present purpose, the Scot, therefore, looked every way except into the face of his exasperated foe, while he proceeded- 
                
               "It is nae at a' times recht, or proper, or convin'yant for a modest body to mak' boast hoo much he has demiritit; for ye ken, Mr. Trelawney, none but the daft fule wad gang sie a gait as that; an'I ll nae say I hae nae din wrang, for yo kem weel I ken here on a vary improper purpose; but ye also ken, an' I spik nae mair than havven's truth, that settin; aside the prasant, my hale dealings wi' Mr. Jaramiah Pardo, ae bin honest and faith fu' wi'out gainsay or excaption, an' micht warrant an justify a leetle haudin off hans, thoch ye hae me at vantage n my present extramity, whilk is nae jist pleasant the noo." 
               M'What's evasion of the present eharge by an appeal to former dealings wherein he had been faithful, merely because it had not become his interest to denounce his friends, caused Watch to smile; though the ingenuity of the reasoning convinced him more than ever of the necessity of entirely removing a traitor who might again creep into confidence, merely to betray. He had made up his mind to the course he intended to pursue; wherefore, making a sign to Delaware Dick, who still kept his post in the rear of the informer's chair, that sable individual emptied a small phial of narcotic poison into a glass, and then stood, as before, waiting his commander's further orders. 
               You have made a brave defence," observed the latter, addressing M'What, "and half-convinced me that men should only look after themselves in this miserable world;-granted, I overlook the past: will you drink with me, in pledge to keep faith in further?" 
               "I'll na say, but I'll do ony thing to make mysel agreeable." 
               "Some brandy, Dick," commanded Watch. 
               And the black coolly proceeded to mix the liquor, placing the drugged glass before their late ally. 
               "Here's free trade and a rover's commission!" cried Watch, raising his glass; "ours is independent liquor, and scorns allegiance." 
               "I'll no say but it hath a more pleasant assant from that circumstance," said the Scotsman, applying either nostril in succession to the verge of the glass, and looking with a very knowing look; "and suppose by way of addition I drink till our better acquaintance; ye ken I did nothing but to save mysalf, and salf-preservation-you recollect the proverb, and that 'ull save the trubble o' repetition;" and raising the glass to his lips he drank deeply ere he replaced it on the table. 
               The smuggler viewed him with triumph. "He is ours," thought he; "the remainder of that glass, and he falls without noise of struggle." Then addressing M'What, he said- 
               "You have scarce done honor, if it is a pledge of peace between us." 
               "I'll gie ye nae reason to complain on that account," cried the overjoyed Scot taking up the glass; "to purchase the friendship of an honest man like yourself, I'd drain it were it a mile till the bottom." 
               And raising the glass, he drained it to the dregs. 
               The deadly drug he had swallowed crept slowly through his veins, diminishing the circulation by continuous contractions and expansions until the whole mass sunk into universal torpor, and he fell heavily from his chair. 
                
               "Him no alarb de nibbor dis time, Massa Watch," cried the negro 
               "He must be removed, boys." 
               "Ay, ay, Cap'n 
               "Bring the coffin from the closet, and then away to where you left the boat; nobody will prevent you passing with lumber like this." 
               "Ay, ay, cap'n." 
               All hands were instantly busied in trimming the coffin, and placing the body of M'What within his narrow tenement, four of the crew raising him on their shoulders, hurried him off to Church-alley hole, where the boat belonging to the schooner lay. 
               Left to himself, our smuggler lost no time in carrying out his plan of vengence. He unpacked. his knapsack, and transferred its contents to a portmantean; he deducted from the amount in the pocked-book the sum due for the goods, enclosing the balance in a parcel; in short wound up the transaction with a minuteness and precision which would not have lost by comparison with more legitimate conductors of trade; and leaving a man on guard over the officers, he hurried to Bedford-square. Having safely delivered the portmanteau at M'What's residence, he sought for the last time the hospitable roof of Mrs. Jones, whom he found in the hail or passage of her house, regaling the whole of the inmates of her domicil with an account of having seen a coffin brought cut of Mr. Trelawney's new, house by four strange sailor-looking men; and wondering, and exciting an equal degree of astonishment and curiosity in her auditors to know who could possibly have died in a house where nobody lived. 
               "Tis a distant relation of mine, Mrs. Jones," observed Watch, first apprising the assembled fair ones of his presence; they were all so absorbed in the landlady's surmises, as not to hear the door open; "he died in St. Luke's-I got his body last night-and I think it is as well to keep one's family misfortunes as close as a body can." 
               "Poor dear creature!" exclaimed Mrs. Jones; "Well, I thought it very surprising, but I'm glad I heard the rights of it; for as I says just now, I don't think as Mr. Trelawney 'ud do a wrong thing to mortal." 
               "I thank you for your good opinion," said Watch. 
               "I am sure you are very welcome," oberved Mrs. Jones. 
               And Watch sought his chamber, reflecting on the various hazards a man's frailties ran of detection in London, where any strange occurrence sets a neighborhood in commotion, and where curiosity, once stirred up, nevel suffers pause until its appetite is satisfied. 
               "Well, I am safe thus far," cried our smuggler, entering his apartments; "I sit me down the monarch of a garret. But a truce with jesting, I must complete my purpose and then away with M'What to Batavia, without friends or money, to thrive on his own insignificance, and crawl again into fortune as heretofore. 
               Our smuggler now prepared for the morning's denouement, by addressing she following letter to his landlady:- 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "MRS. JONES,-On receipt of this, with enclosed receipts for rent, I desire you will take possession of the house I occupy; I give you the furniture, having no longer any occasion for it; the end for which l hired it is accomplished-my revenge is satisfied. Be silent on the subject of the coffin, and release the two men you will find bound in the kitchen, giving them the enclosed. Let no one seek me, for after tonight it will be vain to look for 
                           
                              "October 18. 
                              "MULDOWNEY TREDAWNEY."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               On the paper enclosed, he wrote;- 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "The contraband goods are at M'What's, in a leathern portmanteau; basten thither, and let the loss for once fall on the proper person. 
                           
                              M. T."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               Having prepared every thing for the morning, Watch sat down to wait until the inmates of the house were buried in sleep; when, placing a couple of guineas on the landlady's letter, partly to enforce attention and partly to keep her mouth shut, he stole gently down the stairs, and returned to his own house, where he found his comrade still watching the now silent officers who, having thought and drank, and drank and thought again, on the most feasible method of getting rid of the disgraceful bondage imposed on them by the smugglers, and having inwardly vowed to take a condign revenge whensoever they should have the opportunity, while they outwardly swallowed the unpermitted liquor, reconciling their consciences to such a profanation by considering the act of raising the glass to their lips as a seizure, had fallen into a state of comfortable devotedness and snored in unicon. 
               Our smuggler now busied himself in removing his false complexion, hair, and whiskers, and in a very few minutes appeared with his dark and clustering curls round a forehead whose whiteness formed a fine contrast with his bronzed and healthy complexion below, and in a suit of clothes which sat on his body as if nature had intended him for a gentleman. 
               Leaving him thus occupied, we will, for a moment return to the party of smugglers who escorted M'What in the coffin, who, on leaving the house, made their way as quickly as was consistent with the burden they carried, keeping their leader in their eye, who, looking directly forward and as unconcerned as if conducting a legitimate corpus, made his way by Grucechurch-street and Fish-street-hill. Nor is it wonderful they were neither checked nor noticed by the police or passengers in the overgrown metropolis. Every one was too much busied by his own affairs to notice the silent progress of death to its final resting-place; indeed, too busy to think of anything but themselves. Shakspeare tells us, that 
                      
                        "A pound of man's flesh, taken from a man 
                        ls not so estimable-profitable neither 
                        As flesh of muttons, beeves, or gouts." 
                     
                   And as the immortal bard, notwithstanding the alteration in the habits, manners, and even fortunes of the people, still leads the town, we presume it was a consideration of this kind that induced passengers to permit a coffin, at ten o'clock at night, to pass unchallenged through the most public thoroughfare in London-for they did let it pass, and even reverently made way for it. 
                
               The temptation of a glass of liquor having removed the watchman, the coffin was put aboard at Churchyard-stairs; and the boat's crew in their places, the bowman cast off the two half-hitches that held her, and the coxswain turned her head to the tide. 
               The air was calm, serene, and still, and the silver face of the water silently struggled in the moon's brightness against the forced embrace of night, trembling even if she obeyed the mandate of the sable god. The hundred spires which rear their heads in London, in all the majesty of devotional character, were clothed in one sheet of resplendent light. Nor sound of voice, nor whistle of bird, disturbed the silence of that hour: the hum of occupation had ceased; even the lawless smugglers were filled with awe by the holy, solemn loneliness of the time; when, as they neared the centre of the river, the voice of their coxswain rose upon their ear, in the most anxious tones, as, feeling the full sweep of the tide, he made every effort to stem the current. 
               "Larboard oars, pull, or we 'thwart the centre arch. The tide runs like a wild horse; head round! pull starboard." 
               And a sudden crash announced their contact with the starlings of old London Bridge. Dick Delaware's oar was broken, and the black thrown overboard by the concussion, while the, boat, righting, was impelled forward by the torrent, and boiling and roaring eddies, the crew trembling at the danger they had escaped, and impressed with awe by the judgment which had fallen on their companion. 
               "Poor Dick," said Binnacle, mournfully; "so, he's gone!" 
               And in the midst of the boiling surge they looked their last look to discover a token or remembrance of their lost companion. 
               When the negro, however, was canted out of the boat, he was fortunately thrown into the centre of the stream, and feeling the strength of the tide, turned upon his back, and descended, feet foremost into the hell of waters that boiled below. He burst through the first surging eddy in safety, although well nigh stunned by the roarings of the water; a moment afterwards a wave struck and heaved him above the foaming surge in sight of his companions in the boat. 
               "He's there!" cried Binnacle; "Pull in boys, a rope may save him yet." 
               "No, no," said the coxswain, mournfully, "nothing can save him in a surf like that: our own boat was whirled round like a cork; what can a man's strength avail him?" 
               Delaware Dick providentially, had not lost his strength, although, he was nearly deprived of his senses; and on feeling the force of the concussion, he dived, swimming beneath the surface of the water, and working his way by the course of the tide. After two or three more dives, he rose in smooth water, considerably in advance of the boat wherein his anxious companions were on the look out for his body deeming him dead. 
               "Bout a h'y!" shouted the negro, as soon as he recovered sufficient breath; "bout a h'y!" 
               "Hurrah!" cried the boat's crew, pulling towards him; "that Dela ware must be the devil." 
                
               "Nax time I go t' America," exclaimed the negro, on being hauled into the boat, "l swim down Niag'ra; dat debbil ob a pless l jist kem out ob; neber had sich punches 'pfore." 
               And giving way, the crew arrived at Limehouse, without further accident, laughing, as usual, at past danger, and the negro, himself laughing as heartily as the best of them. 
               Hoisting their lumber, as they facetiously called the coffin and the body in it, they rigged out tressels in the after cabin, and depositing the coffin upon them, waited the arrival of the smuggler captain for further orders. 
               To leave no circumstance appertaining to this history so unexplained as to invole the slightest doubt of its correctness and capability of proof, we must return to the domicil of landlady Jones, who, as it may be necessary to inform the reader, in the morning, at seven o'clock precisely, ran up stairs to call the supposed Trelawney, with all the anxiety to please with which an appearance of no lack of money inspires a vulgar mind; howbeit, after knocking several times without receiving an answer, the cautious Mrs. Jones tried the handle of the door, and found, though it yielded to her pressure, the bird had flown. 
               Casting her eyes around, they caught the glitter of the two guineas laying on the letter he had addressed to her. "Well, he's a generous creature!" exclaimed she, putting the evidence of his munificence into her pocket; and, after reading the note, determined, like a prudent and discreet personage, to keep the contents to herself, take possession of his house and household furniture, and frame an accountable reason for changing her residence: nor will it be necessary to state, that she released the two custom-house officers, or that they pursued implicitly the directions of the smuggler, in capturing the goods at M' What's house, and thus rendering that individual more obnoxious to the government than ever. 
               In the meantime our daring contrabandist, enjoying the success of his scheme, and perfectly convinced his incognito was inviolable, reached Limehouse, and, in his new metamorphosis, only arrived on board the schooner a few minutes before M' What awoke from the entrancing effect of the potion he had taken. 
               He started up from his narrow tenement, and stared wildly around him. 
               "Where am I?" cried he. 
               "Amongst the friends you would have betrayed," replied the smuggler captain; "friend who will take due care of you, till you are passed the power of stinging them." 
               "Am l a prisoner?" 
               "Yes." 
               "I'll alarm!" 
               "Stop!" exclaimed Watch; "do not attempt such madness; remember, the man who abstained from taking your life, has still the power to command your death." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VII. 
                
                  
                      
                        "There are more things in heaven and earth, Haratio, 
                        Than are dreamt of in your philosophy." 
                     
                   
                
               THE alarm which interrupted Mike the Mavis and his companions, in their abduction of Susan Wylie, arose from the diminutive sheriff of the country and his brother hunters, on their return from pursuing the smuggler, who had so cunningly eluded them. That dignitary, with determination to leave nothing done by halves, which had honored many filling higher offices in the state, could not reconcile himself to the idea of leaving the lrish maiden any where but at the hostel whence she had been taken in the morning; and, though somewhat discomfitted, and, from a variety of concurrent causes, not altogether in the best odour to himself or others, the consciousness of virtuous perseverance beamed forth in a look and smile of self-gratulation, that shewed him amply rewarded for the exertions he had made. This fact you might gather from his manner, rather than any audible boasting, which he scorned; and he sat, reining in his steed, and bridling himself at the same time, with his mouth depressed at the corners, his neck bowed, and his chin plumbing his chest; while an expression of satisfaction played over his sallow visage, as he jogged up and down on his saddle, in a manner highly edifying unto the beholders. 
               The lrish maiden, though her beauties were somewhat obscured by the morning's accident, still rode in front of the gallant Hogsflesh-her countenance exhibiting a species of intellectuality very rare among persons of her grade, as in her face an ingenious speculatist might find a knowledge of the world; her round cheeks, encrusted by mire, channelled by tears, and cracked under her efforts at speech, presenting as near a resemblance unto those maps of the eastern and western hemispheres, formerly published, for the use of schools, by Laurie and Whittle, as can well be imagined. Riding behind her, the amorous follower of the sheriff felt himself privileged, by proximity, inclination, and the necessity of sustaining her in the saddle, to grasp Bridget's waist. He thus attained a double advantage over the ordinary run of suitors who, shackled by conventional form, are compelled to consult propriety, and make love a la distance.
                
               The third male personage, to wit, Master Oliver Hobbs, observing the effect of Mistress Bridget's charms on his companion, not deeming her of sufficient importance to induce him to follow the example of some learned sublunarians, and endeavor to spoil sport, left Hogsflesh to make his best way to his private ends, while he continued to make his own way onward, closely following the sheriff in all his movements, sittings as uprightly in the saddle, and jogging up and down with synchronous motion, as if he had been as acrotypical representation of his master, or, in less ambiguous, and therefore more familiar phraseology, that dignitary's double. 
               Left thus to bring up the rear, Hogsflesh pressed the lrish maiden above that part of the boddice which is said, by the knowing in such matters, to cover the heart; and twisting his face into a contortion of tenderness, endeavored to cast what has been called by competent philologists, a sheep's eye over her shoulder, exhaling, at the same time, a sort of grunting evaporation, which he designed for a sigh. Finding, however, this first approach to tenderness unresponded by the maiden, he pressed the region of her heart again, with a vigor that caused her to turn and inquire what he meant by it; when her eyes encountered those of her fellow traveller at the very moment he was leering into a lateral expression of amativeness, and had just dropped his jaw in an effort to give audibility to another sigh, of which he was preparing to deliver his laboring bosom. 
               "Arrah! fhot do ye mane by pinchin', an' squeezin', an' squintin', an' makin', sich ugly faces?" asked Bridget, entirely at a loss to understand the dump crambo of her companion. 
               "Oh, Missus Bridget!" languished Hogsflesh, expressing his passion by a most hideous twist of features, while his off-side eye seemed ready to leap the bridge of his nose to gaze more closely on the maiden's beauties. 
               "Is it sick you are, man?" inquired Bridget, who could not conceive the contortions of her companion's countenance had taken rise in any thing but actual spasm, and had no idea that the various grimaces he was making, sprang solely from the torrent of tenderness that, flowing from his heart, pervaded his entire system; "Is it sick you are?" 
               "Indeed, Missus Bridget, you have jist hit it!" observed Obadiah, with an emotion which, being more enacted than felt, was accompanied by a change of countenance equally strange; "I am sick-very sick." 
               "The divil's cure to ye!" cried the maiden, "to be lookin' at me like a fool, an' makin' faces like a merry Andrew; if ye're sick, fhy don't ye dismount, and relieve yours stomach." 
               "O, Missus Bridget!" exclaimed Obadiah, making a bold effort to get the murder out; "O, Missus Bridget! you alone can do that." 
               "Fhot!" cried the lrish maiden, in astonishment. 
               "I shall never be well till you make me so," pursued Obadiah. 
               "An' how 'ill I do that?" asked the maiden. 
               "By giving me a salute," returned Hogsflesh. 
               "Arrah! get out wid yer imperence," cried the lrish maiden, with a look of mingled dignity and displeasure, that sat rather ludicrously on the map of the world above mentioned; "sure i've suffered enough by one av yer base sect this marnin' to larn me in future how to demane myself to the whole b'ilin' av ye's." 
               'I doesn't mean no imperence at all, Missus Bridget," said Hogsflesh; "l scorn sich imperations; l mean honorable, an' nothin' else, an' will make you my wife if you aint ashamed of an honest man's name." 
               "An' fhot's yer name, as I shud be ashamed av it?" inquired the maiden. 
               "Hogsflesh!" returned the sheriff's follower, with a doubtful air, for he had already been rejected by more than one damsel on account of his unfortunate patronymic. 
                
               "Sure, my mother's name was Bacon!" observed Bridget. 
               "There's a coin-ci-dence!" exclaimed Obadiah. 
               "I don't know fhot that manes!" said Bridget. 
               Obadiah could not explain; he was therefore silent; he meant it for affection, and that is seldom philological,-indulging rather in the inuendo mode of conveyance by nod, wink, or gestulation, than the elaborations of language; and for this reason, or a consciousness of his inability to solve the enigma. Hogsflesh held his tongue. 
               While Mistress Bridget waited his explanation, which she did with a modest discretion that spoke highly for the stability of her character, she could not help giving the reign to fancy, and secretly congratulating herself on the prospect of a husband, held our in Obadiah's declaration, which contemplation made her silent also; though you might read her internal delight, by her bridling up whensoever Obadiah pressed the region hereinbefore mentioned, and which, since he had told his love, he made a point of doing ever and anon. 
               Alas! who can do justice to feelings such as these? What pen so nicely embued with the etherial essence of mind, as to undertake a description of the human breast, and diffuse the stream of pleasure universally? Who would attempt analysis, or try to retrace effect to cause, testing feeling by a philosophy that would kill such a matter with an ice-bolt; reasoning on a thing without reason, denouncing passion as an absurdity, and coming to a conclusion equally wide of the mark, by denying the existence of what is vulgarly admitted. Suffice it to say, that Bridget had learned to be pleased when Obadiah pressed the region aforesaid, and Obadiah pressed on, in the hope of arriving at the hand and fortune of the Amanzonian maiden. 
               Now, while their mutual feelings had plunged the lrish maiden and the sheriff's man into a state of reverie, the contemplations of the sheriff's self, as he rode through the gap in the copsewood, left him in a condition hardly less abstracted; and even the self-important Oliver Hobbs, catching the general infection, preserved a like gravity, never once offering to disturb the tranquility of their journey by the utterance of a single word, but kept his eyes steadily fixed upon his master, and did exactly as he did. 
               Thus, from different causes our travellers had consentaniously fallen into a silence well befitting the unfrquented road they travelled, for the overhanging trees which shadowed it, seemed to invite the mind to holy musing and heavenward contemplation. Yes, reader, a deep silence reigned amongst them, which might have continued. to the end of this chapter, had they reached the copsewood ten minutes later; but arriving, as they did, at this particular juncture, the piercing cries of Susan, while resisting the gypsies, reached the ears of the whole party. The little sheriff turned pale, but this might have arisen from courage, as might also the huge drops of perspiration which stood on his manly forehead; Master Oliver's lips quivered, but he did not attempt to turn his horse; Bridget looked mixed astonishment and alacrity, from that inherent disposition observable among the lrish in favor of a row; and Obadiah Hogsflesh, with a desperate vigor, pressed Bridget's region aforesaid, as if to say,-"Fear nothing, l am with thee!" 
               "Wh-a-at was that?" stammered the sheriff, stopping his horse, and turning to Mr. Oliver Hobbs, who, following his master's example, reined in his steed also, which, after several sneezes showed it partook the pacific disposition of its rider, by grazing quietly on the hedge side,-"Wh-a-at was that, Olly?" 
               "Hon'y a woice!" responded Mr. Hobbs. 
               "A voice!" iterated the sheriff; "it sounds like a cry of distress." 
               "Bathershan!" exclaimed Bridget; "will yer honor hould back whin yer goin' for'ard may be the manes of savin' a woman from disthruction. Hoo! musha, fhy do ye hesitate?" 
               Thus urged, the little sheriff pushed forward, and Oliver, ashamed of manifesting less courage than one of the weaker sex, followed his master, though not without fear and trembling, and many and considerable, doubts as to the eventual safety of their new chase; while Hogsflesh, gathering courage for the occasion, spurred his horse to a pace which soon put him and Bridget in advance of their less willing companions. 
               The little sheriff and his party were thus manfully hastening to the rescue, though the lrish maiden was in reality, the only person who felt like a man among them, when the quick sense of Barney Nous caught up the distant sound of their horse-hoofs, and communicating his fear of being intercepted before they could reach the dell-path, unto his companion, caused him to hurry back to the hedge row of alder trees, on the road to which we left them, for the purpose of finding covert, until the approaching company should pass on. But how easy soever the rape of the Sabines may appear unto cognoscenti who take David's chalky exterlinear imitations of the fleshings of opera dancers for the rounded developments of natural proportion, or connoisseurs who applaud our heroes of melo-drama, for raising and carrying females duly taught to recline on the actors' shoulders, and faint on the lever principle; how easy soever such things appear in representation, we can assure the reader, on our veracity, they are not such easy matters in reality; wherefore we hope that no charge of improbability will be preferred, when we affirm, the two sturdy ruffians found great difficulty in forcing the still struggling, though now silenced girl, to their point of retreat. 
               For though gagged, and therefore unable to cry for help, Susan Wylie was not deprived of her hearing; and having learned, from their sudden pause and hurried speech, that assistance was at hand, exerted her whole strength to free herself, or so to impede their progress as to give time for the approach of the rescuing party. 
               "Haste thee, Mike," said the anxious Barney, urging his companion; "the prads are nearin' us, and we have more than fifty yards to pad it afore we can reach certain cover." 
               "It's all very well for ye to say, haste thee, Mike," replied his companion, in a surly tone; but if so be yer'll catch hoult of her legs yourself, yer'll find they ar'n't altergether agreeable for quick walking; there now. I'm blow'd if one of 'em aint gone. Soho, marm! I didn't barg'in for no kicking when l agreed to carry yer." 
               "Blarm'd if they ben't stopt, Mike!" cried the elated Barney, as he suddenly lost all sound of the approaching party; "they've got hoult of the farmer and we're all right." 
               "Well now, on'y think!" said Mike; when, turning to the now despairing Susan, who made a desperate struggle to release herself he continued, "be quiet, woollee; I daunt want to do nothin' wot's not right to yer, but yer mun come along now acause we've got yer; so ye m'y as well stir yer stumps without all this obstropolousness as not." 
               Animated by a consciousness of approaching assistance, Susan had made the most desperate efforts to delay their progress, and, blindfolded as she was, by her determinate persistance in her struggles, more than once compelled the two gipsies to loose their hold. But her strength was fast sinking, and when the sound that spoke of hope and deliverance, suddenly ceased, her ruffian captors had mastered more than half the distance between them and the gap towards which they were hastening. 
               Giving herself up to despair, she sunk under the consciousness that her resistance was unavailing, and fainted, while Mike and Barney hurried their now passive burthen along at a rapid pace. 
               While this villany was being transacted, the little sheriff and his party were hurrying onward in quest of the daring perpetrators of the outrage. The pursuit was led by the impetuous Mistress Bridget, the country official hanging somewhat a back, and showing, by the absence of his usual alacrituous expression of countenance, that in this moment of painful and perilous cogitation, he really wanted such a leader. Nor should it form a matter of admiration or astonishment, that after the hair-breath 'scapes and dangerous adventures of the morning, he felt somewhat distasted at the idea of encountering new perils, on a day which seemed marked by fate in the outset, to work him nothing but discomfiture. 
               Nevertheless, though by several uneuphonious rumblings, proceeding from the little sheriff's interior, and which are not unusual in dyspeptic patients, his man Oliver, who rode behind him, made a fair deduction, that the fears of his heart had found their way into the region of his stomach: he rode silently on, internally ashamed of exhibiting greater trepidation than a woman. 
               In this state of mental disquietude, the county official heartily wishing himself anywhere else, the cavalcade arrived t the opening of the dell path, where Mike the Mavis and his companion had ambushed, and where Farmer Ashford still lay lnsensible in the road. On coming in view of the body, Hogsflesh reined in his horse by the direction of his companion; who, turning in her seat, to hurry the laggards in the rear-and who were still at a distance, that proclaimed their lukewarmness in the cause-projected her right arm over Obadiah's shoulder, while her ample bosom rested for a moment against his chest. Hogsflesh trembled with the most exquisite emotion; but whether his ecstacy arose from this accidental contact, or the loud shout of the powerful maiden, urging the tardy sheriff to his duty, is a question that must be left unto the reader's imagination. 
               "Heu! mooshu, Masther Shirriff!" cried she, with an exertion of the lungs that might emanate the finest throat that ever yelled out "yoicks" in a fox-chase; "here's murther done!" 
               At the mention of murder, the sheriff's complexion assumed the color of gangrened pork; while his man Oliver, anxious to end a chace that promised nothing but danger, observed,- 
               "Then, has sure has my name's Holiver, we needn't for to go no further; secin' has 'is death fully haccounts for the stoppage of 'is screamin. Well, for my hone part, hi never'eerd a man scream so hafore." 
               "Is it a man scrame that way?" exclaimed the quick-sensed lrish maiden, turning on the sheriff's man a glance of contempt; "arrah, now! ye can't mane that at any rate. Sure, I know a woman's scrame as well as I know p'taties; och, ballaslush! to think a man 'ud be pipin' in that way!. Sure, Masther Shirriff 'll tell ye better than that." 
               Thus urged, the little sheriff, who fancied he had gleaned sufficient laurels for one day, and, moreover, surmising, from sundry internal twitches experienced during the last ten minutes, he was not altogether what the nurse in "Romeo and Juliet" calls a man of whacks, put on a grave look, as was his custom when he wished to bespeak attention in his inferiors. 
               "As you appeal to my judgment, Mis-tress Brid-get Mnl-lagh-ney," said he, desirous of giving the perpetrators of the outrage an opportunity of getting further afield ere he again ventured to pursue them, for, from the silent evidence before him, he entertained rational fears for Lis own personal safety. "As you appeal to my judgment, I feel bound to say that considerable difference of opinion may exist as to the identity of a voice when we cannot see the speaker; and, though I am partially inclined to favor your first opinion, that the cry which led us onward was uttered by a woman, yet I am bound, on the other hand, to assert the appearance of the body before us almost justifies the belief that, non ob stat, the feminine character of the cries themselves, they were bona fide the utterance of the man you see foully slaughtered on the king's highway." 
               "Arrah, masther Shirriff!" cried Mistress Bridget, while her eyes seemed to brighten under the prospect of a row, and her bosom glowed with the Amazonian fires of a former age, "fhot signifies wither it is male or female, honey? Sure you see murther has been done; so purshue thim wid all speed, and a Kilmainham cravat to the vilyians that done it, I say." 
               "Stop!" exclaimed the county dignitary, "may they not have taken to the wood?" 
               "Hi think hit 'ighly probable!" quoth Master Oliver, with a profound look. 
               "Ish! fhot matters fhot the likes av you thinks? cried the Irish maiden. 
                
               "I'm blest if the dead man ain't comin' to life agin," observed Hogsflesh, dropping his jaw into an expression of astonishment. 
               And he told the truth; for the stunned farmer, having partly recovered his senses, now rolled himself over, sat bolt upright, and stared wildly about him, uttering incoherencies as much to the amusement as amazement of the whole party. 
               For the first time seeing who it was (for, when discovered, the farmer's back was uppermost,) Mistress Bridget rendered him all the assistance in her power, dismounting from her seat, and running to a well, and bringing water therefrom in a large crab-shell the gypsies had left behind, when they broke up their encampment in the morning, and sprinkling it on his temples, and holding it to his lips, he took a deep draught, that appeared to refresh and restore him. 
               "Where be Mistress Susan?" asked the farmer, on coming to himself: "where be pratty Missus Susan?, I do hope she be seafe wi't' old man; where be she, eh? hast gotten her?" 
               "Divil a know, I know," answered the lrish, maiden, in dudgeon; "and divil a care l care; a nasty, ondacent, Jezebel, t' be taken' away my husban' as was to be; as if one man wasn't enough for her at a time." 
               "Dang it, Missus Bridget!" exclaimed Ashford, in some heat with the lrish maiden; "what folly be'est talkin' about; you have very nearly ruined all to day by your jealousy; wull ye goo to be a fule for ever." 
               "Arrah, now! fhot sart av a man can ye be to call it folly?" said Bridget, mustering up her feelings in a look of indignation; "or to think av encouraging' Misthress Susan to be a thraitress to the capt't, for the sake of a one-eyed, red-headed vilyain, as had neither grace av God, nor anything else to recommind him? Can ye call yersilf a friend after that, I'd like to know?" 
               "Psha!" said the farmer, turning from the Irish maiden, "that redheaded vilyain was the captain himself. 
               "Musha'd then!" cried Bridget, with a look of astonishment, 
               "The captn's self!" repeated the farmer. 
               "Fhot a blatherum skite I've bin makin' av myself all along," cried Bridget; "that he sh'uld be the captain, and I not know it; I'll never forgive myself, honey: but there's the young misthress afther all." 
               Thus questioned, the farmer recounted, in as few words as-possible, the attack by the two gypsies, their leaving him senseless on the ground, and capturing, as he believed, the pretty Susan; when Bridget, who, setting aside the jealous rage she had worked herself into, while she believed her young Mistress her rival in the affections of the man whom she had determined on for herself, really loved Susan Wylie, became imperious as imperial in her demands on the sheriff for instant pursuit of the vile abductors; and snatching up Ashford's stick, remounted the steed, and urged the enamoured Hogsflesh to put it to its utmost speed, determining, if there were yet a possibility to rescue her young mistress. 
                
               And here we deem it proper to affirm, leaving such of our readers to argue the converse of our proposition as may be so minded, there is at all time an invisible machinery in motion, which leads to an inevitable end, in spite of the keenest wits and most calculating minds; only that keen wits and calculating minds are apt to dispute the startling fact, except, indeed, when they are unsuccessful in an enterprise, on which occasion they agree with us, and lay their own folly on the shoulders of fate, which they nickname accident, and get greater fools than them selves to believe them: and it was this, so called, accidental working of a chain of events, moving at the same time upon a common centre, though in different directions, that afforded sufficient time to bring succour unto Susan Wylie. 
               Had it not been for this singular concurrence of circumstances, there can be little doubt the athletic gypsies would have taken advantage of the time lost in the discussion just described, to have hurried the maiden whom we left fainting under the combined effects on fear, despair and exertion, though the gap towards which they were hastening; where having once deposited her in the dry ditch, they could have safely esconced themselves until the pursuit, dying away, should have left them a clear passage. 
               But when they arrived within about fifteen yards of the spot, bells announcing the approach of a country wagon were heard; and Mike and Barney stopt, as if by mutual consent, uncertain whether to proceed or to remain stationary. 
               The gap, towards which they hastened, in full view of the road by which the wagon must pass; and to bear a body so publicly, smacked of too much of recklessness, even for desperate gypsies; not that they cared for life in the presence of actual danger, but liked it well enough to determine, if possible, not to throw it away. Mike and Barney looked at each other, therefore, for a moment's space without speaking, the expression on the countenance of each beings sufficient to apprise the other of the alarm he inwardly felt. 
               "We shall never get clean through this bis'nis, Mike," said Barney, "that blarm'd waggon has spoiled everything. I wish the bells were down the driver;s throat." 
               "Soa do I, wi' all my heart an' sowl," returned the Mavis; "never wor a bit of a job like this so sp'ilt at both ends. Blarm'd if t' waggon aint stopt at bottom o' t' leane." 
               "I woonder be they cummin' this way!" cried Barney. 
               "Ecod! I think soo," replied his companion 
               "I can bear their footsteps, mysel!" 
               "What shall 's do!" 
               "We must drop our prize, and make a gap to 'scape by," said Barney, suiting the action to the word, and tearing aside the brambles growing between the seems of the alder trees, so here goes, Mike." 
               "Stop, Barney!" observed his companion; the girl seems to have fainted; so we m'y as well take off t' muffler, an' leave her a little air, while we makes down t' coorse of t' ditch, t' have our dinner sauced with the tongue of ould mother, who'll set us down for a couple of thick-heads, for sartain. Hows'mever, worse luck now, the better another time." 
               "Another time! don't you wish you may get it?" said Barney, squeezing himself through the aperture, while Mike, stripping her face of the handkerchiefs, or mufflers as he termed them, left the insensible Susan in the road; and following his companion's example, forced himself through the newly-formed aperture, whence dropping into the dry ditch, he crawled after Barney Nous, with as much activity as if he had practised all-fours as long as King Nebuchadnezzar. 
               The team, which so opportunely frustrated the gypsies' intention, was on its way for the goods which, the reader will remember, were originally intended for M'What, but which had already been conveyed to London. The cartars, therefore, when they arrived at the road end, were astonished at not finding their comrade Ashford waiting for them-it being a rule among the smugglers not to stop long enough in any place to give rise to a suspicion that they were engaged in other pursuits than their ostensible one of conveying farming produce. After waiting a while, therefore, one of the carters; wondering what accident could have detained the farmer, took the green lane in the direction of Copsewood. 
               As the reader is already aware, he had not far to proceed ere he discovered the fainting Susan Wylie, when, hastily summoning his companion to his assistance, he raised her from the ground, scarcely knowing what to do, or how to act, in a matter which has, indeed, puzzled wiser heads than his own, viz., bringing a woman unto her proper senses. 
               Our good Samaritans, however, had scarcely raised her in their arms for the purpose of conveyance unto the hostel of her uncle-for the carters readily recognised her-ere the clatter of horse-hoofs, again resounding in the green lane, announced the approach of rescue; and Mistress Bridget Mullaghney, supported by the gallant Obadiah Hogsflesh, who still pressed the region of the Amazon's heart, as if he thought that operation necessary to prevent it from sinking, emerged from covert at the bend of the road, so as to get a complete view of her insensible mistress, borne along by those whom she conceived to be the two vagabonds she was in pursuit of; and who, after having half-killed Farmer Ashford, were now carrying off Mistress Susan Wylie for purposes still more atrocious. Whereupon, unable longer to control the fury that possessed her Amazonian breast, she flourished aloft the knob-stick of the farmer, with all the vivacity and adroitness of one of her own country dragoons. 
               "Bad ind to ye's! ye's infernal vilyains!" shouted the burning Bridget, as soon as her quick eye caught a glimpse of the charitable carters; "an' sorrogh the reward for sich slieveen vagabonds as the likes of ye's. Hew! Up, Misthress Susan, there's frinds at hand, I'll engage, 'ull t'ach thim betther manners than the likes of these ballasaday thricks." 
               Hearing this strange address, and not being able to comprehend a single word of it, our two carters stopped in the midst of their charitable 
                   
                     THE CUTTER AND THE SMUGGLER. 
                   table work, looking at the maiden and the stick she flourished in her advance at full charge, and then at each other, several times, but without attempting to lay down their burden. They stood stock still, gazing-fascinated, as it were,-while a secret and indefinable emotion of admiration and astonishment had seized upon their faculties, leading them to determine that the excited being before them was either mad or drunk. 
               But if the appearance of Bridget, advancing with the impetuosity of the mountain torrent, or some river which, swelling over its dam, roars and tumbles, and foams and rages, like a bad actor in a good tragedy, struck them with wonder, little dreamt they how their weak nerves were to be astonished in the end; else had they, without doubt, dropped their insensible burthen, cried sauve qui peut, and bolted. Alas! fate had willed it otherwise; for, as the moth flutters its fine and feathery fabricated wings, dallying with a simple ray of light, until its whiskers are singed in the candle; or the fly, trying to walk upon a single line, finds itself suddenly in the clutches of the spider, so proved the carters that it is very foolish to look upon a coming danger when a pair of heels may save your head. 
               "Faigue en ballough!" shouted the Amazonian, as she arrived within hitting distance; and the "crick-crack" vocabulary of Farmer Ashford's stick ruled off a sum total of two. The fair and fainting burthen they were carrying tumbled heavily on the ground, and the two carters, who were so charitably conveying her home, lay stretched on either side, with their faces upward, completely convinced by the Irish woman's argument. There lay the king-hearted carters, punished for their foolish humanity, and giving sufficient evidence of the power of a shileleagh in the hands of male or female of the sister country, their widely expanding eyes exhibiting nothing but the school-room of white to which their sometimes unruly pupils are restricted and confined, and where they run over the lesson of life, until the principal master, Death, calls them up to repeat their final task. Yes, the refractory pupils, bursting through all the ordinary restraints of discipline, had broken bounds, and were engaged in paying a visit of condolence to the monarch brain, on the temporary abridgment of its powers of volition. 
               Having performed this act of retributive justice, Bridget, descending from the horse, raised her young mistress, and prepared for an act of mercy, uttering a lament over her, in which the interjection, Ochochone! was repeated in a tone that spoke of Irish affection while it set the teeth on edge; and the little sheriff, having arrived on the ground, like an able general directed Oliver and Hogsflesh to be ready to bring the carters to him when they had brought them to themselves. The latter personages stood, with the usual quantum of dignified obedience observable amongst such officials, watching over their prey until returning sense should enable them to surrender at discretion.
                
               This good intention of the little sheriff, however, was frustrated by the timely arrival of Farmer Ashford, who, recognizing the carters, now recovered from the effects of Mistress Bridget's blow, at once purged them of all guilty knowledge of Susan's abduction; and, after causing their release, and communicating with them for a moment, assisted Oliver and Obadiah in conveying the fainting girl to her uncle's-Bridget bringing up the rear with a keen lament, so shrill that it even awakened the sleeping sense of Ephraim Clink, whom they found sitting on the bench outside the hostel, and who started and stared with as much astonishment as a man who can understand no tittle of what is passing around him, can conveniently cram into his countenance, finally conveying her still insensible mistress unto her bed-chamber. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VII. 
                
                  
                     "Had you rather your comrade were hanged like a dog, or, by venturing boldly, draw his neck out of the noose that his and our enemies have placed round it.
                   
                
               WHEN Ned Topman and Timothy Clarke were handcuffed together, and removed from the cage, the escort and parish officers, having left the prisoners under the care of the carter, adjourned into the nearest public house, to fortify their stomachs against the effects of the night air, by expending a part of the allowance money, made for their journey, in what the united presbytery have agreed in designating "creature comfort," and teetotallers, alcohol; a custom which, though heretofore said to be "more honored in the breach than the observance," and fast fading from the fashion of modern days, may probably trace an origin anterior to the time when the fair Princess Rowena pledged Votigern in wassail-which, being translated into English, signifies brown stout in disguise. 
               Left thus to themselves, these two too intimately connected links in the social concatenation can hardly be said to have been satisfied with the kind of companionship they were thus in a manner compelled to; for handcuffs, though applied in certain in certain cases agreeably to prescribed conventional rule, produce a most anti-social effect on the parties compelled to wear them. It is no wonder, therefore, that the ci-devant master's mate inwardly cursed the injudicious though friendly zeal of his companion in misfortunate, and wished he had been dumb, ere, in his eagerness to serve his (Topman's) cause, he had related the circumstance of Hardbrace's nasal bleeding, and thus established a fact not previously revealed. The hardy smuggler knew the value of truth too well not to be fully aware of the advantage he had lost by the immature disclosure; he had also been too long acquainted with the world not to appreciate the difficulty of erasing an opinion that had once been formed. But, though deeply impressed with a sense of his own danger, the unmanly idea of compromising the safety of his friends never entered his mind. Hemmed in by a shoal of circumstances, he scanned the perils of his track with an eye of cool determination, resolved to attain the smooth water beyond, or perish in the attempt; he scorned to enact a meanness that would taint his name amongst the men with whom he had so long been in the habits of friendship and confidence, and on whose recollection he must depend for the small portion of fame and celebrity; and, therefore, determined to die game, rather than suffer a love of life to betray him into a base or dishonorable course towards the confederates or himself. 
               "They will remember me," thought Topman, as he sat handcuffed in the cart; "yes; they will remember me when I am dead and gone and often when enjoying the winter-cup we have in afore-timed pledged together, will they say, 'Poor Ned, he died rather than betray us!" And what is death, after all, when life is so uncertain? 'Tis only leaving the world a paltry hour or two before I might be called on, even though I should win a breathing place by turning traitor to the men with whom I have been so long in league. Should I fear death? No, I faced danger too often to have to learn how to die when called upon." 
               Such is the elastic nature of the human mind, that a moment afterwards, hope lit up the picture with a gleam of sunshine that made Topman smile; and his heart swelled with the thought of rescue-a prospect which, as the reader has been informed, the desperate habits of his associates rendered anything but visionary. He knew their numerical strength; and, added to this, their means of concealment might bid defiance to the whole power of government, so long as there was no treachery among the confederates; and he was too staunch a hound himself to suspect a dastardly spirit in men pledged by mutual danger to keep a secret on which all must depend for safety. Yes, in this moment of despair, when evidence from the ocean grave of his murdered comrade had sprung up in terrible array against him, Topman found hope of deliverance in the instinctive promptings of what his own courageous temper would have led him, under similar circumstances, to hazard for another. 
               His companion, Timothy Clarke, on the other hand, who, suffering for having told the truth, could not, in his simplicity, comprehend by what misprision of mind he had been committed by the magistrates to take his trial, on charge of a murder of which he could not have known anything, until long after it had been perpetrated-not having been called up the cliff till after Hardbrace had met with his untimely fate, he therefore sat completely dumb-foundered. 
               The thought of being hanged by a lubber of a landsman, who could not tell the differences between a clove-hitch and a bowline knot, was the apex of misery. 
               Not that Timothy Clarke cared one farthing for his life,-he only disliked the manner of dying; nor would the execution have awed or daunted him, had it taken place in the regular course of such matters, amongst the Blue Jackets. He now felt he should be doubly degraded;-there would be no yellow flag upon the occasion-no signal gun-no boatwain's mate to officiate to rig out his chin-tackle in a proper and seamanlike manner. The boatswain's mate, the officer who must have conned over every knotty point of which a three-plied cord is capable, long before he could have hoped to fill his situation, would not be there to tie him up; neither would any of his messmates see him march out under an escort of marines, and die like a hero in a melodrama, without shewing the white feather. 
               The absence of all these essentials in the form of hanging was, in Timothy Clarke's estimation, infinitely worse than the punishment itself. Indeed, it drove his mind so far from its usual propriety, that the passers-by, who occasionally lingered near the cage, from a curiosity to look at its inmates, one and all set him down as mad; nay, many of them, in the exuberance of their humanity, said it would be thousand sand pities to punish a poor deluded creature like that, as he evidently did not know what he was about-a pre-expressed opinion which, had it been noted down, had certaily disqualified the individuals for the panel, though otherwise competent jurors. 
               The arrival of the parish officers with the cart, and unlocking the cage entrance, while it startled the taciturn and thoughful Topman from a train of reflections conjured up by his situation, brought pretty considerable relief unto Timothy Clarke, by speaking of another stage in the, to him, most unpleasant journey of life, and giving him some hopes that he might make an end of it at last. He held out his hand, to be firmly bound unto his fellow prisoner, with the sang froid of one who came into the world for the mere purpose of going out of it again; and this act, although the reader may in many respects take him for a fool, proved he was a far greater philosopher than many therorists who have written on fortitude, and fainted under affliction. 
               While the parochial authorities was engaged in completing the process of attachment between the master's mate and the foremast-man, which he did by fastening the right hand of one to the left hand of the other in a pair of country ruffles-an operation which he fumbled over from a want of sufficient practice-Timothy Clarke quietly discharged his saliva, which he invariably did when about to trust his tongue with what was passing in his mind, and grumbled out- 
               "Bear a hand, will ye, mate, and let's get under weigh quickly good luck to yer; I'm tired of this here dry dock, and want a launch and an' a good offing-" 
               "Ah! you'll be launched quite time enough, I dare say," said the officer; "I wonder at yer wickedness to speak so, after having committed such a base and cruel murder; but you'll be well hanged for it, I dare swear." 
               "Do yer, now?" observed our friend Timothy; "well, that's what I have some doubt about. All as I can say is, I never knew a land chap as could handle a cord properly. The chaps as come nearest to it wor the 'longshore lumberers; and them there like is all as one as seamen; an' I shouldn't like to be disgraced by bein' turned out in any way onproper." 
               "You'll find that all right, don't doubt," said the officer. 
               "I hope so," said Timothy, in a tone which spoke his sincerity, as he stepped into the cart, in joint and several steps with his brother bondsman; when, quietly depositing themselves at the bottom thereof, they remained, as stated in the outset of this chapter, silent and moody, while the parochial authorities hobbed and nobbed it to the success of their journey, and their prospect of the two forties. 
               "Well! I think this here's a queer kettle o' fish," said Timothy, at length tired of silence. 
               Topman did not answer, and his fellow prisoner continued- 
               "I carn't see, for the life of me, not for no manner o' reason, as I shu'd be placed in this here preminiry; to be hanged acaus' I tells the truth an' offers to bear testimony to what I knowed, which couldn't be no crime, no hows: for if so be as a man is to be hanged for what he know, some o' the cute chaps ought to be on the look out arter their selves: for I mind as I heerd say once long agone, as them as was most knowledgeable had most to answer for; wherefore as I says as this is a queer kettle o' fish, and ain't got no justice in it, to hang an ignorant man for wot he knows, and let others wot knows a deal more escape." 
               "Be silent, Clarke," returned the thoughtful Topman, annoyed almost to petulance by the silly rambling of his less knowing companion, "be silent; who put hanging into your head?" 
               "Who?" quoth Clarke; "why, the gentleman as fitted us wi' these wris'bands, that sits so oneasy." 
               "Make yourself easy, Master Clarke," returned Topman; "there is'n't rope enough in his Majesty's dockyards to hang you." 
               "There's a good d'l rope out of them there," observed Timothy Clarke, with an air wavering betwixt doubt and affirmation; "an' them land chaps are more cuterer nor we." 
               "I tell you, Tim," returned the master's mate, "you're safe so long as you keep your mouth shut." 
               "How can the likes o' you purtend to know the law?" asked Timothy. 
               "Tim, your only chance of safety is in being silent." 
               "Go and tell the likes o' that to the marines!" exclaimed Timothy Clarke; "ain't I had my trial afore his honor, the capt'n? and didn't the gentlemen wots a scortchin' us to prison, talk about hanging? You carn't shut my ears, with all yer knowledge: an' to talk about keeping myself safe arter that are, don't argufy much sense, Master Topman, an' that's my conwiction o' the matter." 
               "Pshaw!" exclaimed Topman, impatiently; "you are not tried yet, man!" 
               "Not tried yet!" echoed Clarke, turning up the whites of his eyes; "come that is a good un!"- 
               "You are not, I tell you." 
               "Ha!" interjected Clarke, "you'd better tell that to the gentlemen wot's a scortchin' us." 
               "Gentlemen!" said Topman; "they are poor ignorant men, and know nothing of the matter." 
               "O don't they, though!" said Clarke with an air of downright disbelief; "don't they?" 
               "Indeed, they do not." 
               "Ha!" said Timothy again, "you are just like the man wot told the chap as was goin' to be hanged: 'They can't hang you,' says he; 'but they are goin' to hang me,' says 'tother. 'I tell you they must'n't hang you,' says he. 'But the rope's round my neck,' says t'other 'Then its again the law,' says he. 'Law!' says the other, 'what's a law to a man in my sitivation!" 
               "Will you be ruled by me?" asked the master's mate. 
               "Not while you talks sich nonsense, I can tell you," returned Clarke-"why, man I can stand it all without flinchin'; an' as for owin' you any grudge for wot's happened, that's not in my mind. I seed a shipmate mate blowed out o' the tops wonst, when our ship was running of ten knots afore the wind: the cry of a man overboard runned fore and aft; the crew were like so many bees, and in two minutes every sail lay flat upon the mast; the boat was hove over: how the poor fellow struggled, to be sure! and how the boat's crew pulled!-I could see it all from the top; and our mainsail was big enough to cover boat and man when he went down; I've often thought that might have been my lot, master Topman; an' what's hangin' after all, but a sudden affair like that there? on'y I hope them land chaps won't make a bunglin' tie, that's all." 
               This resignation on the part of Tim Clarke touched his fellow in misfortune more than could all the reproaches contained in the world's vocabulary of vituperation; and the master's mate would gladly have shaken hands with the foremast man, and acknowledged a due sense of obligation, but from the impracticable nature of their position for such a manuvre. 
               As it was, this convulsion expressive of an Englishman's thankfulness, expired at the elbow and the wrist; and Topman shook the handcuff in harsh and grating discord, to the harmony of sentiment he intended to convey, inflicting on the unfortunate Timothy a sensation that made him roar- 
               "'Vast there, Master Topman! these here wris'bands, aint quite convenunt to be taken with the shivers in." 
               "You're a good fellow, Clarke," exclaimed the master's mate; "and I forgive you everything although they hang me." 
               "Forgi'e me everything!" echoed Timothy, with a marked note of admiration. "Well, I like that! Come to make up a reckoning o' both sides I thinks as how I ought to do that like." 
               "Well, well," returned Topman, frankly, "perhaps you have the most cause to complain, though if you hadn't spoke aboard, we should never have been in this situation." 
               "Every bullet hath its billet, Master Topman," returned the foremastman, "an' so long as you takes your fair share o' the blame, if ever I says a word of unkindness, why stow me in the galley amongst the skulkers when there's duty to be done-that's all. Though for the matter o' that, I aint likely to do no more duty now, seein' as my recknin' in the voyage of life, is so nearly brought to a close; but it's all one, whether a man's thrown into the sea, or dies at Grinnage; no one can ask a question of yesterday, as old Mike Tarpaulin used to say." 
               "Right, Tim," returned the master's mate; "no one can cause the return of yesterday, or command the result of to-morrow: life is an eternal present, and has neither past nor future." 
               "I carn't exactly undercumstumble that there," said Timothy with a ruminating look, "though I dares for to say its all right." 
               And, as is generally the case amongst people who are unable to comprehend a subject, Timothy Clarke fell into a fit of contemplation which relieved his fellow prisoner from the necessity of further speech; and revolving in his mind, while he turned the quid in his jaw, the many mishaps he had encountered from his boyhood until the present time and all the evils that had been subservient to his life, and questioning what there was in life that he could live for, and then thinking of the girl whose gown he had torn when the black's leg was scalded, even she would have nothing to say to him, and then referring the rejection to his rough jacket and hard hands; and then he wondered why men should be so widely contrasted in their conditions, or why the captain should wear a cocked hat, and the common man a south-wester, drawing at the same time, an exception in favor of some officers whom he had seen mount a sou'-wester, in like manner as sailor as knew his business-with this qualification, however that this circumstance only took place in stress of weather; finally concluding that a pertinacious clinging unto life, amidst sufferings and privations which cut off nearly every thing desirable in existence, was unworthy a man who had to keep a look out a-head, that presented nothing but breakers to himself and smooth water to every body else. 
               The contemplation, however, was broken up by the two preventives ordered by Captain Trunnion to form an escort rousing Topman and his fellow prisoner to drink with them; a circumstance which nearly over-turned all the philosophy acquired by Timothy, in his previous reflection, convincing his natural reason that there was a drop of comfort in the cup of life, which he had not yet tasted; his heart warmed again unto his messmates, amongst whom it told him he had spent many a happy hour, which, in the affliction of the moment, he had ungratefully forgotten, and he drank their health with a degree of heartiness and good will which proved that he had so far overcome his transient misanthropy as to be willing to live a little longer if he could. 
               The two parochial authorities, elevated into a no inconsiderable notion of their individual importance by the stirrup-cups they had already taken, and the half-drunken preventives having mounted the cart, that vehicle was put into motion, and roused the inhabitants of High-Street by the clatter made by its advance, while the seamen, exhilerated into imitation of those sportive tricks common to the Simia genus, pushed each other from side to side of the cart, and occasionally tipped the hats of the parish authorities over their eyes, twitching the elbow of their carman-keeping up the spirit of the time by that ceaseless motion, than which nothing is more annoying to the settled habits of the landsman-administering to Clarke and Topman every now and then a bottle of rum, in order, as they said, to bring up the leeway with a wet sail, and swearing there was nothing like housing up the jib-stays when a man was down-hearted. 
               Such was the condition of the party in the cart, as, rattling over the road at full pace, the sailors laughing and screaming out their glee in a song, they commenced the descent of a hill, at the bottom of which stood Billings' Lodge field, where we left Farmer Welling, and the confederated smugglers, waiting the arrival of the party. 
               At about twenty yards distance, the farmer had placed an outpost to put away, if possible, the necessity of shedding human blood, who challenged the cart on its approach. 
               "Stop the cart and surrender your pris'ners!" demanded the foremost smuggler. 
                
               "Stop the devil!" hiccuped Spunyun, as he took a long sweep with his arm; and then, fixing his eye with the dead set of drunkenness, fired a pistol, but without effect. 
               The carman wavered for a moment, as if uncertain what to do, evidently not sufficiently tired of his life to be ready to part with it, and, therefore, unwilling to provoke certain destruction by attempting to defend himself. 
               "Drive on!" roared Spunyun, snatching the whip, and applying it vigorously to the flanks and shoulders of the horse, which sprang forward at full gallop until they reached the clump of trees at Billings' Lodge-field. 
               "Crack! crack!" went off two muskets of the concealed smugglers. The shots taking effect, the poor animal reared first, and then springing forward, fell; while the sudden cant threw the carter sprawling on the body of the horse, the two parochial authorities maintaining their dignity, by showing themselves uppermost of the prostrate. 
               The preventives, drunk as they were, accustomed to the sudden heaves of a vessel, kept their feet like a couple of cats under the concussion; and springing over the sides of the cart drew their cutlasses and remaining pistols resolved to do their duty, or sell their lives as dearly as they could against the odds opposed to them. 
               But if they understood the use of their weapons, they were opposed by men no less wary than themselves; and odds and art, against courage and art, leaves little chance to the latter, save unconditional surrender; but that was a word unknown in the vocabulary of the two preventives, who could not say "enough" while anything remained to oppose them. Every call for a surrender, they answered by a slash, or a desperate lunge, that drew blood from their opponents. The wish to spare being so ungratefully returned by the preventive men, one of the smugglers, whirling the club end of his musket, laid Spunyun's companion dead at his feet. 
               "Ye cowardly lubbers!" cried the infuriated seaman, making a cut at one, and slashing a smuggler's face in the sweep of his return; "ye cowardly lubbers, do you call that like sword play?" 
               The end, however, proved it was no matter what they called it; for one of their dangerous antagonists lay alone in his glory and just as Mat had let fall hand and foot together, to render the blow he was making more certain and deadly in its effect, a contusion from the club of the same musket sent him to join his companion. 
               The parochial authorities, but little accustomed to feats of broil and battle, had surrendered at discretion in the onset, holding out their hands to be secured by the smugglers, in token that they submitted their lives to their mercy; they sat looking on the efforts made by the brave preventives, secretly wishing they could find courage in their hearts to make in to their assistance. 
               Indeed, so interested were their feelings in the result of the encounter, that, on seeing the club end of a musket strike the two preventive men behind, while they were manfully opposing their antagonists in the front, they could not help crying out- 
               "Foul! foul!" 
                
               "What are you jawing about, fool, I should like to know?" said one of the smugglers; "if so be you had been alongside them poor fellers, fighting in your duty, there might have been some chance for them; but, sitting there, like three crows upon a carcase, doin' the lookin' on part, it doesn't beseem you to say a word on the subject." 
               "They are down!" exclaimed the farmer, in a hurried tone; "come, come, lads, bear a hand! d'ye hear? I shouldn't wonder but the cracking of these muskets brings some of the preventatives upon us." 
               "All right, sir." 
               "Secure those lubberly cowards first," said Welling, pointing to the parish officers; "though we are the gainers by their faint heartedness, I could find it in my heart to give them a dozen." 
               "I hope you won't find it in your heart to order any such thing," observed a constable; "we are peace-officers, and have nothing to do with the sword and pistol, and such like deadly weapons." 
               "You are cowards, peace or war!" exclaimed the farmer with contempt; "but come, your craft is necessary here. Take these handcuffs of the prisoners, or I'll send a brace of bullets through your heads." 
               The prisoners had, by this time, descended from the cart, and stood in the road, waiting their enfrauchisement-Topman surrounded by old companions, who shook his free hand, as if they intended to wring it off; and Timothy Clarke, staring with the most stupid air of bewilderment that can be well conceived, scarce knowing what to think of the crowd of men in smock frocks, slouched hats, and craped faces, by whom he was surrounded, or what characters they could be, who, thus daringly, on the king's highway, had murdered their escort, and effected the rescue of two prisoners. 
               Invited by the above gentle persuasions of Farmer Welling, the unwilling parochial authorities freed the wrists of Topman and Clarke from the steel circlets, which confined them, merely to find themselves bound to each 'other by the same instrument a moment afterwards, when, lashing the wrists of the carman to those of the constables, the smugglers left them back to back in the road, to carry intelligence of the misshap which had befallen them to Captain Trunnion, and the magistrates; and, assuredly, never yet did mathematicians make greater efforts towards quadrating a circle than these worthies in their tria in juncia movement upon Ramsgate. 
               Rid of the presence of the officers, and secure against any chance of their pursuing them by this precaution, the smugglers, now unscrewing their guns, stowed them away in a portable compass, and sought their homes in different directions, leaving the open road to whomsoever the firing might have disturbed-Farmer Welling, Ned Topman, and Clarke, taking the road to Welling's farm, at a pace which bid fair to reach their destination long before the officers could alarm the town, or cause pursuit to be raised against the daring band of smugglers, who had made the rescue. 
               "You have done by me, Tom," said the the master's mate, "you have done by me just as I'd have done by you, or any friend in the same trouble." 
                
               "I know it, boy," returned the farmer; "but who is the other prisoner?" 
               "A simple-hearted fellow," observed Topman; "and as good a sailor as ever broke biscuit. He must take pot-luck with us in future, for he'll be hanged if he's should be taken." 
               "That's a tolerable security for a man's good faith, though not always a certain one," said Welling. 
               "You cannot doubt it here," said the master's mate, "if he takes service with us." 
               "If he takes service!" interrupted the farmer. 
               "I understand you," observed Topman, "all who are admitted to share our secret must take service with us, or remain prisoners-I warrant he shall take service." 
               "Well, well," said the farmer, "he shall; tho'f, for my part, I think our secret is known to quite enough already for our safety as a body; and had I had my will, I had rather lashed your companion to the rest, and left him to learn the navigation to Ramsgate than run the hazard of the dangerous confidence you are about to repose in him." 
               "I'll answer for him," repeated Topman solemnly; "the poor fellow has run all hazards for me, and I could not bear to send him back to certain death; for my escape would have so exasperated Captain Trunnion, that death would have been nothing to that poor fellow's life, if returned upon their hands. No, no; leave him to me, and I'll answer he is faithful." 
               Though my no means convinced of the policy of admitting Timothy Clarke into a full knowledge of Welling's Hole, and the purposes to which that cavern was devoted, Welling ceased to oppose resolution, though he could not help reflecting on the dangers that might probably arise from such indiscreet confidence. The farmer knew the world too well not to be fully sensible of the utter impracticability of a vulgar mind trained into a routine of duties to superiors which affixed an odious character on insubordination. That this crude sailor, therefore, notwithstanding the perilous jeopardy in which his life was placed, should determine to raise his hand against the power he had been so long in the habit of subserviency unto, the farmer thought was not all probable. Howsoever in other respects he might defer to the opinion of Ned Topman, whose masculine mind was accustomed to meet danger, and turn it aside by his own natural energy,-and who, dispising the caution that weighs probabilities or ponders on consequences, either left matters to right themselves, or warped them to his own purpose by any means that fortune might throw in his way, Welling felt a strong presentiment or foreboding that the admission of Timothy into their fraternity was fraught with imminent peril, if not involving total destruction to the fraternity which had so long continued to defy the government powers, by keeping their secret inviolable. Apprehensive suggestions such as these naturally filed the farmer with disquietude, and he could not help secretly wishing himself fairly rid of the proposed addition to the confederacy. 
               A few minutes more, and they found themselves beneath the roof of Farmer Welling, when, over a plentiful supper, they soon forgot the difficulties and dangers of the past, till the farmer, leading the way to the barn, bound Timothy Clarke's eyes; and, opening the secret entrance to the hole, conducted that individual to an abode which would leave him master of but two choices for the future, viz., to sail under a bold, roving, and free flag, or endure imprisonment for life. 
               When the bandage was removed from his eyes, Timothy Clarke stared about with amazement. The chamber they occupied was well-lighted by two ship lamps, and the hammocks and bedding promised him a night's lodging which could be anything but disagreeable to a man jut rescued from the gallows. But Clarke was to much of a sailor not to venerate his king and country beyond every earthly consideration; and, accordingly, when Topman informed him the conditions on which he might enjoy his future life and liberty, the foremastman rejected his proposal with indignation, telling him flatly he'd sworn to serve his blessed Majesty, and sooner than commit perjury he'd be d--d. 
               "Remember, Clarke," said Topman, "you are in the hands of men who will not be trifled with; you have already seen how they served your two shipmates." 
               "Yes, and if I could only ha' got alongside of 'em, I'd ha' taken pot-luck wi' my shipmates, and made the match more equal. The cowardly lubbers-a dozen upon two!" cried Clarke, slapping the upper part of his thigh with great energy; "they may-but kissing goes by favor; I aint afeard of death." 
             
             
               CHAPTER IX. 
                
                  
                      
                        "How merrily, how gallantly we ride upon the sea; 
                        The morning is all sunshine, and the wind is blowing free." 
                     
                   
                
               WHEN our hero introduced himself to the captain of the revenue cutter on Ramsgate Pier, after the affair between the boat's crews, which had cost his Majesty's service the lives of two seamen, he completely wormed himself into the good-will of the government officer. His easy suavity of manners, acquired during a long and intimate acquaintance and association with the continental world, and from his aptitude at impersonation setting on him as naturally as if he had spent the noviciate of his life in those elevated circles wherein a false notion of politeness renders principle subservient to dissimulation, at once passed current with Captain Trunnion. He could entertain no suspicion of a man differing so much in every respect from the rough-hewn specimens of humanity he had hitherto encountered under the guise of smugglers; while his alleged pursuits, comprehending the universal benefit of the service, as well as the open and frank invitation he gave to board the schooner, closed the Captain's eyes against many suspicious circumstances be might otherwise have laid hold of-his open and generous nature rendering him totally unfit for the meaner duties of the service. 
               Hence he took no account of the extraordinary length of the schooner's spars, or the immense quantity of canvas she carried, and which would giver her considerable advantage over the swiftest cutter in his Majesty's service; neither did he feel his nautical pride galled by the saucy aft-rake of her masts, which, like a conscious beauty in an operabox, seemed to say-I am your's if you can take me. To have noticed such matters on such a craft belonging to a gentleman-and the easy nonchalance of our old smuggler proclaimed him nothing less-did not appear quite the plumb; therefore what would have been at once condemned in a vessel belonging to a person of a less pretending character, was passed over without observation in the craft of the apparent aristocrat. 
               The schooner was therefore suffered to depart for the port of London, as civilians say, without lawful let, prevention, or hindrance; the captain of the Wasp leaving the odium of interfering with the private property of a man of such extended views and extraordinary suavity unto the Pontius Pilots of the Trinity-house. 
               The saucy, rakish-looking craft was, therefore, worked out of Ramsgate harbor, without question, although in such a questionable shape; and a light breeze from the south-east, and a golden beam from the garish sun gladdened every heart on board: and what heart so cold in its feelings as not to find joy, and buoyancy, and gladness, under the cheering influence of a bright beaming sun and bracing breeze, amid undulating waters which seem dancing in unision with a harmony perceptible only to the human breast! 
               Old Boltrope, the steersman, rough, weather-beaten, and silent-a thorough seaman, who could not find a word to waste when on duty, accustomed to the schooner, could find out her trim to an inch of canvas; nor was he a man to shorten sail, let the wind blow how it would. Indeed, he had been too long in the habit of running from the revenue people to fear a spread of canvas in the foulest weather. Old Boltrope had the management of the craft, and worked her round the forelands, and made Margate Roads, leaving everything in the shape of a sail to follow in his wake, for the wind, when he had passed the above-mentioned headlands, was nearly aft. 
               Securing his tiller, therefore, and letting the schooner run before the breeze, he stood watching the silver eddies churned up by the gallant vessel in her onward progress, until, paling at first into a sickly yellowish hue, they lost themselves, becoming incorporated in the shining emerald around. He, however, occasionally looked a-head with a cast of thought in his countenance, as if an habitual acquaintance with the inconstancy of the ocean had taught him to distrust the continuance of favorable weather. 
               And ever and anon would the stern and tough old sailor withdraw his eyes from the sparkling foam of the sea, to survey the scudding clouds above; thence to fix them on the vane at the main-topmast head, diverting their gaze from the vane to the fleecy scud, sensibly alive to the slightest alteration in the breeze that carried the dashing little schooner onward; and looking in the binnacle to be assured the vessel headed her course rightly; and all with a solemn taciturnity, which proved his mind was too intensely occupied to admit of speech. 
               Old Boltrope, who had not spoken since they cleared Ramsgate, now called to a sailor, who was standing near the foremast, half asleep for the want of something to do- 
               "Bladen!" 
               Ahi, sir!" 
               Do you want a night-cap?" 
               Something like it, I think." 
               I think so too," observed the old steersman, with a sea grin, at the same time shading his eyes as he looked towards the fore-topmast head; "you've been yawning there this half-hour, so just contrive to keep yourself awake by tautening the fore-peak haulyards, and hoist the fore-topsail-'d'ye hear? We must make the most of this breeze while we have it." 
               "Hadn't you better take in a little of the canvass?" observed the seaman last addressed, who, being part owner, thought himself authorised to offer an opinion before be obeyed the steersman's orders. 
               "Hadn't you better teach your grandmother," snarled Boltrope, displaying the characteristic temper of an old seamen when a young one ventures upon a contrary opinion. "Why should I take in my canvas, I would wish to know?" 
               "We are like to have a squall," was the reply. 
               "And what the devil have you to do with the squall, Master Bladen?" asked the old steersman in dudgeon. "Are you 'sponsible when I steer? and if so be a squall does come on, it wou'dn't be the fust we rode over. Do you think it likely to blow us out o' water, eh, young Spit-to-the-windward? I say agen, tauten the fore-peak haulyards and set the fore-topsail; I'll not take in a single reef, blow hard as it will, so long as the wind is in the present quarter; so hoist away, d'ye hear. 
               "Ahi, sir." 
               And in a moment afterwards the creaking of the taper spar against the mast was heard in its upward progress, and, the sail filling, gave a fresh impetus to the beautiful craft, which dashed gallantly along at the rate of fifteen knots, throwing off the spray like snow-flakes, as she over-rode the ripple that seemed to dispute her right of passage. 
               The seaman last addressed now approached the steersman. 
               "I don't altogether like sich lofty gear, Master Boltrope," said he; "so much canvass, when there ain't no partic'lar occasion for it, isn't no good, with the wind threatening to blow more than a capful." 
               "Fore-and-aft sails are easily struck if we are put to it, young Bladen," returned Boltrope, coolly; "and we head our course well enough at present. With this wind we shall make the Nore afore sundown." 
               "An hour or two can't make no difference," said Bladen. 
               "An hour or two'll make all the difference, young man," observed the steersman. "A wind puffing that way," he continued, pointing to a vane, "never continues long in one quarter; and in less than the hour or two you talk of, I expect to see it shift dead a-head. No, no, Master Bladen; depend on't a good seamen will never let the wind get a-head of him if he can help it." 
               And bounding over the crested waves, the Witch made way at a ate that seemed to devour the distance, and before sun-down, as old Boltrope predicted, had passed the Nore, bearing her course gallantly owards the port of London, groaning under an immense stretch of canvas, which seemed to strain her innermost timbers, and boring away headlong under a wind that made her tremble from stem to stern, as obedient to her experienced helmsman, she sped through the opposing waters. 
               Arrived below Limehouse, the Witch quietly dropped her kedge and striking her sails, remained waiting the orders of her commander, and ready to start at a moment's notice. The boat's crew engaged in the affair at Welling's Hole had arrived under the guise of farming men and joined their old companions on board the schooner, far remote from suspicion, and therefore free, for the present, from those processes of law which men call prosecution, or persecution, according to the medium through which they pass under their inspection; that is, in proportion as they are viewed at a distance as contemplated benefits, or felt nearer home as certain injuries. 
               With this explanation of the schooner's movements, we will return to our narrative. We have already seen our hero completely successful in his designs upon the treacherous McWhat, whose fate now depended on the mandate of the smuggler. The intention of Watch to transport the traitor-poor, friendless and dependent-to Batavia, in requittal for the injuries he had intended to inflict upon his former friends, has already been narrated. But the delay made by our hero in taking measures to render McWhat's ruin in England certain, nearly proved fatal to the schooner's crew, by involving them in a collision with officers whose report might embody danger in a distinct form, far more difficult to be avoided by our hero than the suspicions of the simple-hearted and sincere commander of the Wasp, whom he had contrived to deceive at Ramsgate. 
               Be it know to our readers, there is a set of mischief-making, meddling marplots in London, who, acting in their capacity of conservators of the Thames, thrust their noses into every man's affairs who presumes to navigate a craft upon that noble river, and who, in the present instance, having received a report from another set of men called informers, of a schooner rigged contrary to regulation, determined to inquire into the matter. The latter class, or Thames informers-thanks to the thinning influence produced on the Waterman's Company by steam and its co-operating consequent starvation-is fast fading into its original nothingness. And such a sublime effect has the new power, notwithstanding its coercive effect on every class, that we are called upon to view it as a national benefit by certain learned philosophers, whose wire-drawn theories would teach us that the thews and and sinews of mankind may best maintain themselves by the bracing qualities of a perpetual vapor bath. 
               Now these conservators of the Thames, having received a report of a strange-looking schooner carrying booms and canvas contrary to the regulation for craft of like rigging and tonnage, took it into their heads to inspect the same, and ordered a boat and officer, with instructions, to board the craft, and measure and condemn the booms, &c., if he saw occasion; 'and which boat and officer appeared in sight of the schooner a few minutes after McWhat awoke from the effects of the opiate. 
               The crew of the schooner, fatigued by their over-night's duty, lay sleeping, some on deck and some in their berths below. The smugglers usually kept watch up and down; though the fatigue incidental to their last duty formed an exception to the rule, for the watch up was down, and the watch down was not up, the only man on board who could be said to be perfectly awake being old Boltrope, who, sitting on the binnacle, cocked his eye up, and down, and round about, and whistled like a sailor in a calm, from the sheer habit of past days, for when he has nothing to do, your seaman is the most restless animal in the creation. 
               Our here remained below with the captured McWhat, little dreaming of the approaching Trinity boat, or he had long ere then slipped his kedge, and dropped further down. 
               Affairs on board the smuggling craft were in this condition when the Trinity officers made their way down the Thames, for the purpose of shaking hands with her captain, and taking away her spars and sails in the most friendly manner possible, like those valiant servitors in the play, "not fearing a dog of the house of Montague, having good quarrel and the law o' their side." 
               Mcwhat, in the meantime, having recovered from the surprise incidental to his novel situation, had quitted the narrow berth in which he had been transported on board the schooner, and sat plunged in an apparent stupor on the locker at the further end of the cabin. He now plainly saw he was entangled within the meshes of the net he had so artfully spread for others, and that he had become the victim of a conspiracy too well laid to afford either hope or chance of escape, and cursing the folly which had led him into the snare, vainly wished to recall the few past hours-a common custom among the sons of mortality when they find themselves distanced in the race, and the odds in favor of adverse circumstances. 
               At the opposite end of the cabin sat his captor, silently observing the various feelings which mantled in the Scotsman's countenance, with such a degree of fiendish delight as might inhabit the breast of a man of strong energy, who looks upon the base and treacherous enemy he has conquered; while the self-abased and prostrated McWhat, not daring to raise his eyes towards the conqueror's, yet willing to mitigate surrounding circumstances, tried to speak, but his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth whenever he attempted to address him. 
               In this painfully oppressive silence the captive and his captor remained, until Boltrope first observed the approach of the Trinity-house 
                   
                     THE SMUGGLER AND THE INFORMER. 
                   boat pulling down the stream, and dropping towards them, as if it were their intention to come aboard, when the old man alarmed gave notice by walking to the head of the companion ladder and calling- 
               "Below, there!" 
               "What now. Boltrope?" demanded Watch. 
               "A boat dropping down the river, and making as if she'd run aboard, sir," answered the old steersman. 
               "What is she like, Boltrope?" 
               "She carries a flag astern with four brigs and a dog's body with a marline spike in his paw." 
               "Heaven be praised!" exclaimed McWhat, clasping his hands; "it belangs to the Trinity-hoose; an' as I'm a true presbyter I weel ken I shall be saved by it, whilk is a miracle I didna expact." 
               "Silence villain!" sternly commanded the smuggler chief. "Silence, and rest assured nothing shall save you, though I peril my own life to bring you to the punishment your trustrated baseness so justly merits." Then turning to Boltrope, he continued, "Rouse up Delaware Dick and the deck watch, and turn up all hands below; let the kedge be weighed and drop down with the tide at once; lose no time about it, d'ye hear. Should the Trinity people come alongside and attempt to board us, Boltrope, you know what to do, without my telling you." 
               "Ay, ay, sir," returned the old steersman, quitting the companion hatch, and rousing Delaware Dick and the deck watch, and turning up the rest of the hands. The kedge was got up in a twinkling, and the schooner swung round with the tide, when the Trinity-house people arrived within hail. "Schooner ahoy!" shouted the officer in the approaching boat. 
               "Ready the fore-staysail there," bawled old Boltrope, without noticing the hail; "and you Delaware, stand by the main haulyards ready to hoist away. The wind never comes when wanted. Whew! Whew!" whistled the old man with increased agitation, as the Trinity boat drew nearer. "Whistle, and be d-d to you! whistle!" 
               The captive Scotsman, painfully alive to the terrors of his situation, constrained his every faculty to catch the lightest sound on board the schooner, hoping to convey to the Trinity officers a knowledge of his situation, and thus not only frustrate the avowed intention of the smuggler, but give both him and his crew to the outraged laws of his country. He heard the distant hail, and his heart swelled with exultation; and the minute's silence that followed seemed an hour to the wretched McWhat in his intense anxiety. 
               "Schooner ahoy!" hailed the Trinity officer again. The sound spoke the boat nearer. McWhat could no longer govern his emotion; he started from his seat, and made two steps towards the companion ladder. The simultaneous click of Watch's pistol checked the movement, and he stood averting his head and extending his hands, as if attempting to ward off the apprehended shot, while a convulsion of terror shook his whole frame as he caught the obdurate expression of the smugglers's eye. 
               "Take your seat, sir," said the latter sternly, "I have told you you have no chance of escape, and my word is not a light one. My safety is now too deeply interwoven with your fate to permit it. Sit down then, tranquilly, and conform to your new circumstances, for by all my future hopes you have only to choose between death and submission." 
               The Scotsman retreated to his former place in the cabin, and Watch stood sentinel, ready to sacrifice him on the spot rather than hazard being betrayed. 
               "Schooner ahoy!" again resounded in their ears. 
               "This wind 'ill never come?" exclaimed the old steersman, stamping with vexation. "A capful and we are clear off. The gallant little barkey feels the full force of the tide. Ha! there it comes sweeping along the surface. Stand by, and hoist the peak of the mainsail, Delaware. The fore-staysail has it now. Pretty bird, how she spreads her wings!" 
               The schooner, however, had not time to feel the full force of wind and tide ere the Trinity-house boat pulled alongside, and the bowman caught at her main shrouds with the hitcher. 
                
               "Why didn't you answer hail?" demanded the officer. 
               'who the devil's to answer you?" growled Bo trope. 
               "We demand to come aboard to examine your masts and spars." 
               "Not at this time of day, young man," replied Boltrope, "if I'm to know any thing about it; so you'd better cast off afore any further harm's done, d'ye hear?" 
               "Board there!" said the officer astern, authoritatively. 
               "Hold hard!" cried the old steersman, "ere you compel us to shed unnecessary blood; hold hard I or I'll send you where you won't come back again in a hurry." 
               "Hold on, bowman," commanded the officer; "and get you aboard, Bill Tibbs, as quickly as possible; we'll teach the scoundrel to question our authority before we've done with him." 
               "About ship!" shouted Boltrope. 
               "About it is." 
               "Let go the main and fore sheets." 
               And the immense mass of black canvass swelled out under a heavy gust, bringing the lee beam of the schooner down on the nose of the Trinity-house boat, so as nearly to sink her. The bowman, however, still held on with the hitcher, and the waterman directed to go aboard sprang forward and caught hold of the taffrail. 
               "Paws app, Massa Pompey! Oo no teach to hold gas' dis time, howeber," said the negro, giving the waterman a gentle rap of the knuckles with the head of the batchet, that caused him to loosen his hold and fall overboard, and then cutting through the hitcher, sent the Trinity boat astern to pick up her man and make the best of her way back again. 
               "She has it now, boys," said the steersman, watching the main-topmast as it creaked and yielded to the wind. "He was a good man as seasoned that main-topmast; she springs up against weight and pressure like tried steel. Come boys, three cheers for the Trinity-house!" 
               And the crew crowding aft took off their hats and cheered the Trinity-house boat, whose crew was busied in getting Bill Tibbs aboard again. 
               "What!" exclaimed Boltrope, a moment afterwards, "they hav'nt surely the impudence to try to catch us with this breeze; there's something more than we can well fathom in this matter. We must hoist all our canvas; there's always danger to the likes of us when a boat of that sort stakes so hard at a race it is impossible to win." 
               "Blow breeze! blow breeze!" said Binnacle. 
               "You need not tell it blow much harder," grumbled Boltrope. "So long as it holds us down to Erith it will have done its duty; and a heavier wind below, boys, will carry away some of our sticks." 
               "Grinnage a h'y!" shouted the negro on passing the royal hospital. 
               "There's what they are pulling for," exclaimed the old steersman. "Look, lads! I told you there was always danger when men exerted themselves apparently without a purpose, and yonder's a revenue cutter. As sure as my name's Boltrope, we shall have a busy afternoon of it; for depend on't she will soon be in full chase of us." 
               "Massa Boltrope," cried the negro, "oo all as one as dem profitables." 
                
               "Prophets, you fool! Will you never get instruction?" said Binacle." 
               "No pool prapits by distruction. Oo wrang dere, massa." 
               "Port-helm," called Boltrope. 
               "Hard-a-port, sir," answered the tillerman. 
               "Stand by and let go the jib-sheet." 
               "All ready, sir." 
               "Hanl in the main-sheet" 
               "Ahi, sir," exclaimed several voices together. 
               "About ship." 
               "About she is." cried several of the crew, as she wore round without shivering a sail. 
               "Well done! trim done!" exclaimed the old steersman, with a degree of pride in the well-executed manuvre, which none but an old seaman can fully appreciate; and he looked up to the mast-head to conceal the triumphant vanity he felt stirring within, but which nevertheless peered out at his eye-peeps with an inconceivably odd expression. 
               Directing the tiller to be lashed, he now walked abaft, and looking at the revenue cutter, observed a stir upon her deck, as if some orders had been given to the crew. 
               "By the Lord Harry, Delaware!" said he, addressing the negro; "I sh'uldn't wonder if they weigh and after us, without waiting for them rascally Trinity chaps." 
               "No, no, Massa Boltrope," returned Dick; "it's on'y our 'perior saillin' day look at. Don't see notin' like dat ebery day; dey tink, begor, ve belong to de und'rtakers cu'pny. Ha, ha!" 
               "You are right, Dickey, my boy," returned the old steersman; "they'll not after us this bout, I dare say; and it will be a good half-hour afore the Trinity men can spread the alarm." 
               "Shoo'den wornder," exclaimed the black. 
               "I will try more canvass then," said the old man. The negro shook his head dissentingly. "Don't shake your head, Delaware, or show your wool against me. Hoist the main-gaff." 
               "Impossible, sir," said Bladen; "the mast will never carry so great a press of sail; it creaks and bends under the wind, and seems ready to spring every moment. 
               "Can't help it, Master Bladen, we must try it on," said the old man sturdily. "Our on'y chance agen them revenue men is a good offing between us; they carry as heavy a press of sail as we can." 
               "You'll never get an offing with this wind," gruumbled Bladen. "It's right ashore, and with so much lofty canvas the schooner's head will hardly wear on her starboard tack as it is." 
               "If it blew dead ahead I'd beat up against it with such a dog in chase of me," cried Boltrope impatiently. "Masts, spars, and canvas don't cost nothing; and our scrimmage down yonder will be apt to be thrown into the bargain should we be overtaken; they don't treat us free traders as gentlemen, I can tell you." 
               "What harm can they do us; we didn't fire upon them." 
                
               "Fire upon them! I should think not," said the old man. "Men like us don't risk life for nothing; but what we have done may subject us all to a heavy fine and imprisonment." 
               "For God's sake, sir," appealed Bladen anxiously; "for God's sake ease the fore-topmast; I expect it will spring every moment." 
               To this solemn appeal Boltrope made no answer. Thus adjured, the veriest pirate out at sea would hardly dare refuse; nevertheless, he gave no immediate order. But very few minutes elapsed before he saw the full force of Bladen's apprehension; for the wind increased to a hurricane, rearing through the heavens and stirring up a turmoil in the waters, that was not pleasant to look upon, and more particularly as the returning tide met the schooner and impeded her progress. 
               "Let go the fore and fore-topsail haulyards, neck and peak," shouted the old steersman, roaring above the roar of wind and water. 
               "Ahi, sir," 
               "Haul down, boys." 
               A mingling of voices in chorus now rung on the schooner's deck, as the crew, obedient to the steersman's order, hauled down the yards, when old Boltrope, seeing her eased by removing the press of canvas from her fore-mast, directed the main-gaff to be struck, and double reefed the mainsail, beating down under a fore-staysail, jib, and half-mainsail, at the rate of six knots, in a gale of wind that, if fair, would have carried the schooner at least fifteen. 
               While the deck exhibited this scene of bustle, McWhat continued in the cabin, a victim to the most horrible suspense. The hail of the Trinity-house boat had inspired a hope which he cherished as the maniac miser counts the straws upon which he reposes, and gloats upon imaginary riches. The cool orders of the steersman on deck to take up their kedge, as well as the vessel's motion, soon dissapated the the dreamy illusion, and he sat in mute despair, afraid to encounter the cold eye of the smuggler, who had mastered him. McWhat felt his energies were unequal to cope with the steady and stern determintion of such a foe. 
               Still, so painfully sensitive is fear, he strained every nerve to catch the lightest whisper that might speak of hope again; and on the Trinity officer ordering the man on board, he started from his seat on the locker at the far end of the cabin. The smuggler, however, slowly raised his hand, and turning on him his terrible eye, with a look of the most implacable hatred, silently presented a pistol. 
               "Great God," exclaimed the terrified McWhat, "is there nae mercy?" 
               Watch sneered with an expression of the most bitter scorn, and looked with a fascination that superceded the Scotsman's powers of action, while he muttered-"Mercy for such as thee!" 
               "Mon or fiend!" exclaimed McWhat, as ye hae hopes o' marcy for yersal, hae marcy upon me; dinna ruin a' my hopes, an' the hopes o' the bairns, wha look up till me; gie me freedom, an' I'll swear-" 
               "Swear!" laughed Watched in scorn. "Swear! have you not already broken all the ties of honor?" 
                
               "I hae muckle raison till repant o' sic a misdeed," returned the Scot; "an' ye ken weel that havven itsal-an' ye mun believe in havven-grants pardon till the repentant." 
               "Let heaven pardon then; but preach not mercy unto one, who, if he dare to point a gun in defense of his own, is hanged like the poor dog for biting the rascal who stoned him." 
               "Ye ken weel society has laws for its own government." 
               "Society!" exclaimed the smuggler, and he laughed in bitterness. "Society!-a monster of many heads, whose varied interests huddle under power to oppress the struggling man. Society has laws: you say truly. Society makes criminals, and then punishes them for their misdeeds. What right have you to speak of social laws, who have violated every obligation of social brotherhood?" 
               The smuggler ceased to speak, and drawing his sea-cap over his eyes, gazed intently on the motionless figure of the Scotsman, who, silent and sullen, had sunk again upon the locker, heedless of the confusion on the deck of the schooner, heedless of the howlings of the storm and the dangers that seemed gathering around them. 
             
             
               CHAPTER X. 
                
                  
                      
                        "One hour will still their fears-and on the morn 
                        Thou wilt behold the ruin, wreck and corse, 
                        Float on the weltering wave." 
                     
                   
                
               "A government cutter bearing sou'-west!" said Boltrope, disturbing his reverie. 
               "She must be avoided," returned Watch, starting on his feet; "it won't do to be taken. Send down Delaware, Bladen, and Binnacle, to gag this Scotchman and secure his feet in shotted canvas. He must overboard if the cutter comes too close upon us; we must not suffer him to tell tales of our whereabout." 
               Ere the sound of this cruel order had died away, the lumbering, heavy tread of the negro and the other seamen was heard descending the companion ladder. 
               "Mercy! mercy!" cried the Scotchman, throwing himself at Watch's feet, and sweating with agony under the prospective apprehension of death. 
               "Silence! and carry him on deck," coldly commanded the smuggler chief, and his word was obeyed to the letter. Then turning to McWhat, he continued-"Do not fear; no unnecessary blood shall be shed, nor any uncalled-for torture inflicted. Remember your own excuse for betraying us; 'tis self-preservation that dictates this precaution, and you surely cannot be averse from suffering by the doctrine you have taught to others." 
               The effects of old Boltrope's obstinacy in holding so heavy a pres of canvas under an apparent adverse wind had now become apparent unto every hand on board the smuggler's craft, for the schooner had made so much leeway, as almost left her at the mercy of her pursuer, or, what is worse to a sailor than either fighting or imprisonment, little chance of escaping total wreck, except by running her ashore. Had it not been for the government chaser, it is probable Watch would have attempted this manuvre at all hazard, and beached the light vessel to wait the event of the tide; as it was, they had no other resource than to stand on for sea. The cutter evidently gained ground upon them, or rather topped their water; and by still keeping to windward, and thus compelling the smugglers to hug the shore, threatened to make the schooner an easy prize. 
               Conscious of the threatening aspect of affairs, the smuggler crew stared stupidly on their advancing foe-at the first a mere speck in the horizon, but now amply developed and perceptible to all aboard. They then involuntarily cast their eyes, hitherto occupied by the sail on their starboard quarter, to the stern of the schooner; but the saddened aspect of the old steersman, who seemed to have lost his spirit under the threatened exigency, forbade them to cherish any hopes of an escape from a fate that seemed inevitable. The old man appeared astounded, and inwardly repented of the self-will which had placed the schooner in a position so perilous. Still he endeavored to wear his beautiful vessel so as to get the weather-gage of the passing cutter, aware that it was only by a long leg to starboard that he could vary the position, so as to get the schooner an offing, and so give her a chance of escape; but the old man tried all his seamanship in vain to effect this desirable object. 
               Such was the state of things on board the schooner when old Boltrope reported to Watch, who having directed Delaware and the rest to secure the Scotchman in the manner before narrated, ran up the companion ladder, and appeared on the deck to take the command in their present emergency. 
               There is what the French call a caractere, and the English a fortune, about some men, that never forsakes them in the most adverse circumstances, and thus bids defiance to all human calculations on results; and the schooner's crew, notwithstanding the appearance of the government vessel, notwithstanding the wind on shore, and other circumstances so threatening to their safety, found hope revive within them when they saw their favorite again amongst them; and the cool and deliberate bravery with which he walked abaft, and took the bearings of their pursuer, infused such a degree of confidence in the men, that they simultaneously, as it were by a common volition, took off their hats and gave three cheers: and although their whole efforts, seemed unavailing to contend against the still increasing force of the sea, rolling in from the main in aggravated violence, under the influence of the heavy gale, they clung to the fate of their intrepid leader with a degree of confidence amounting to superstition. 
               "We must to work steadily here, boys," said he, addressing the crew, after having taken the bearings of the government vessel, in a tone of voice rendered steady by strong mental effort. "We must work her steadily if we would escape either a lee-shore or a long imprisonment, both bad things to men accustomed to the open sea and a roving, jolly life." 
               "We'll die-first!" exclaimed several of the crew. 
               "That's right, lads-die all! die merrily!" said the smuggler; "but we may as well, before it comes to that, try to live a little longer. There, boys, she heads her course bonnily, though four or five points nearer the enemy." 
               Delaware, Bladen, and Binnacle, who had in the meanwhile secured the treacherous Scotchman, now brought him upon deck, bound and gagged. Unable to vent his feelings, yet filled with the most horrible uncertainty for the future, the wretched man felt his heart rising, as it were, to his very throat, which, parched and dry, and feverish, seemed almost inadequate to administer the offices of life. Incapable of motion, as he lay, he found it utterly impossible to exclude the dreadful anticipations of impending death, yet clinging with an instinctive tenacity unto life, that rendered the certainty of its approadhing termination the more bitter. He now experienced how much real happiness is locked up within the very uncertainty of tenure by which we hold our existence; but which uncertainty renders so many mortals miserable, by embittering the prospect of to-morrow. 
               "Stow him in the boat, boys!" commanded our hero," and protect him from the spray with a bit of sail-cloth. Nay, do not look so imploringly," continued the smuggler, addressing his captive, "we must all die at one time or other. If I get the weather-gage of yonder government vessel, you will be safe: if we have to fight her, we will not leave you, to whom we owe so bitter a debt of retribution, to triumph in existence. Into the boat with him, boys! Look, the cutter notices our manuvre, and changes her course; we shall soon feel her metal, lads, if this wind don't change." 
               Bladen now approached the captain with a cautious step, hardly daring to trust himself to speak his fears of the approaching conflict to one who seemed so bent upon a bold and determined course of action. The only time Bladen had smelt powder was in the affair between the boats, and the danger being then obscured by the thick haze of the night, he was better able to endure his chance, being wholly unconscious of its time of coming. It has been seen already he was a cautions seaman-and one of that cast is not always capable of calmly waiting a common danger-and when he saw the government cutter his fears rose in exact proportion with the nearness and certainty of its approach. 
               "Do you really mean to fight her, Mr. Watch?" questioned he at length. 
               "Not if I can possibly avoid it," was the reply. 
               "I am glad of that," observed Binnacle. 
               "How do you mean?" 
               "Why I think fighting's always best to be avoided." 
               "So do I." 
                
               "Well then in that respect we are agreed." 
               "Certainly." 
               "So," concluded Blade, "if we can't escape by our superior sailing, we may as well run alongside and surrender; by that means our lives will be spared, and as its only an affair of spars and rigging, why"- 
               "I am sorry we have a coward on board, Master Bladen," observed Watch. 
               "A coward, Mr. Watch!" echoed Bladen. "Why you wouldn't think of fighting a vessel in his Majesty's service! You know its hanging matter to fire on one of them Think of that, Mr. Watch-think of that." 
               "You'd better go below, Master Bladen," said Watch in a reproachful tone. "You had better go below, lest your example infect the rest. I had rather not see a man near me who fears an enemy less than he fears death." 
               "I don't fear death when it comes ship-shape, Mr. Watch," observed Bladen. "I think nothing of going aloft, blow hard as it will; but, some how or other, I do not like iron shot. Zounds! flesh and blood won't bear it." 
               "Why I grant its a matter rather difficult to stomach," returned Watch; "but she will soon be within range: but now I have thought on't, you had better go down and assist in getting up some of the bedding, and as cannon-shot seem a sort of forced-meat to you, stow your hammock in the boat and get you into it; the woolpack may save you from a chance hit if you'll only keep yourself quiet when the fun begins." 
               "A pretty sort of fun, Mr. Watch," exclaimed Bladen. "But it strikes me there will be very little joking in the matter; and as I ain't exactly used to it, why I don't care how long it is delayed.' 
               "Away, you poltroon!" 
               "That's a very uncivil word, Mr. Watch," returned Bladen; "a very uncivil word, indeed, to address to a man because he has a little less brutal ferocity than his fellow-creatures." 
               "I don't know what you mean by brutal ferocity," observed Watch, with some contempt in his tone and manner; "it is a word invented by land-lubbers to conceal their fears, and hide their want of pluck when circumstances call them into action. And as to the force of morals in controlling oppression, or asserting right, nature's book, which is open to all mankind, has not a word in it that spells that way. We all know her doctrine, and few have to learn that an encumbered atmosphere is best cleared by a thunder-storm." 
               Walking abaft to take the bearings of his pursuer, and observing the cutter still gained upon him, Watch directed the hammocks to be got up, with whatever other soft material might be on board, to serve as a defence against the shot of the revenue vessel; and a moment after, his crew were bustling like so many bees, each preparing to annoy the enemy or defend himself. 
               "Bladen!" said the smuggler chief, willing to get rid of a man whose fears might encumber the more courageous in their work, and at the same time to conceal his dastardly spirit under the appearance of duty, lest the example should infect his companions; "Bladen, take your station in the boat, to be ready with the prisoner in case of necessity." 
               Like most men similarly situated, Bladen felt his vanity somewhat mortified by this command, which he knew had arisen from Watch's mistrust of his personal courage; wherefore he lingered on deck, when our hero continued- 
               "Did you not hear me, Bladen?" 
               "Yes, sir," returned the latter, "but I was thinking"- 
               "Thinking, sir!" echoed Watch, "what has thought to do with such moment?" 
               "Not much, indeed, Mr. Watch," answered Bladen, in a quailing tone "or I should never have wished to occupy a more dangerous and more important situation in the coming engagement." 
               "O!" returned Watch, "if such be your wish, you can easily be accommodated. Stand ready with a gasket, in case any of our rigging is shot away or wounded; you can splice a rope, I know, with any hand aboard, Bladen." 
               "A man may be very useful in a less conspicuous office," exclaimed Bladen, turning pale under the idea of exposing his precious eyes and limbs in the line of way which a shot had travelled before him." 
               Watch laughed. 
               "We are getting too close to be comfortable," said he. 
               The words were hardly out of his mouth before the booming sound of one of the cutter's carronades was heard rumbling upon the gale, and the shot might be distinctly seen skimming and skipping above the water until its strength was exhaused, and it sank at a distance of about three hundred yards astern of the schooner. Bladen looked around him in alarm. 
               "Why, man, what are you afraid of?" 
               "Afraid, Mr. Watch! that's a cruel insinuation." 
               "Come, come, Bladen," observed the smuggler chief, "decide quickly whether you will go and look after the prisoner in the boat, or take the gasket and stand ready to splice any rope that may be crippled. We shall have more of those messengers than we can well know what to do with before half an hour has passed over us; so you had better take your post as soon as possible." 
               "Mr. Watch! Mr. Watch!" exclaimed the terrified Bladen, "how can you talk in such a manner; its altogether as bad as blasphemy, to listen to that sound, and see that iron ball dance on the top of the water, and talk as coolly as you talk-what can you be thinking of?" Bang went another shot. Watch turned to mark its progress, and found it fell short of the former gun. 
               "We are gaining on them," cried the smuggler 
               "Harrah!" cheered the men. 
               "What can you be thinking of?" said the cowering Bladen, creeping instinctively up to Watch, as if he thought being near his intrepid leader would lesson his personal danger, at the same time turning as pale as ashes. 
               "What can you be thinking of?" 
               "The best means of saving the schooner," replied the smuggler chief. "We are just as liable to point our toes to Kirk's accompaniment for an innocent shot as a guilty one. Stand ready, boys!" continued he, addressing the crew. 
               "Ahi, sir!" exclaimed they. 
               "Bang went another gun; and poor Bladen, unable longer to controul his feelings, suffered his discretion entirely to get the better of his valour, and slipt down on his stern-post without power of motion. 
               "Mr. Watch! Mr. Watch!" he exclaimed, "I am extremely unwell, the motion of the schooner disagrees with me." 
               "Get into the boat, then!" commanded the smuggler chief. "This is no time for an old sailor to be sea-sick; get into the boat, and clap your hammock and as much sail-cloth as you can betwixt your head and her gun-wale, and you'll be out of danger. I have yet great hopes of ending this bout without fighting for it. We are out of gun-shot, and once past yonder headland we shall be safe for half-an-hour's quiet run; and who knows what change may occur in half-an-hour? a wind off shore, or a grave among the breakers, will make for us or our enemies: and its an ill wind that blows nobody good." 
               Boltrope, who during this speech of Watch's had occupied himself by observing the manuvres of the cutter, now exclaimed- 
               "She wears her head a point or two further eastward, as if to come down upon us with a long sweep, and make us feel her broadside on her larboard tack." 
               "We must near the wind, then," cried the daring smuggler, "and hold in a parallel course. By this means we shall get the weathe-gage of her, and drive her ashore if it must come to a scrimmage." 
               After the lapse of a few minutes the cutter fired another shot, in order to feel her distance, which, though it fell considerably astern of the schooner, neared her in consequence of her last mannvre. Watch, however, was too well acquainted with the advantage he should derive from it when the cutter bore down on her larboard tack, to suffer that circumstance to alter his course and he determined not to show a gun until the proximity of his enemy was so close as to render it impossible to get away. 
               The cutter wore beautifully round on her larboard tack, and, shaking out her heavy mainsail, came down majestically in a long and graceful sweep, as if she intended to lay herself alongside the schooner, which was still too near the shore to be entirely out of danger, sending a ball from one of her bow guns which fell short of the smuggler, who still held a-starboard. The manuvres on each side were beautiful, the one urging all his tact and skill too bring his opponent to, the other determined not to fight at a disadvantage. 
               Both vessels were under the direction of experienced seamen, and the crews seconded the exertions of their commander with a zeal and intrepidity that left nothing to be wished for on either side. The smugglers, long accustomed to desperate daring, and knowing the punishment that awaited them in the event of capture, stood all the shot with patience, reserving their fire to the last moment, according to the advice of their commander; while the British sailors on board the revenue cruiser exerted themselves with the bull-dog fidelity which characterises them, determined to fight the vessel while a timber held together, rather than haul down the bit of bunting which streamed in the breeze, for the honour of the British navy. Both breathed a desperate determination to be victors in the approaching struggle, and each made silent preparations for action. 
               Seeing that the schooner took their shots so good temperedly, without attempting to make any return upon her well-intentioned friend, the people in the cutter concluded that she either carried no metal on board, or did not intend to fight; and though they hitherto had not hit her, they bore down now at a speed and in a range which would soon enable them to put out their feelers as to the ultimate intentions of the clipper craft, and whether she would fight when she could no longer run away. 
               "Down, Bladen! you'll get hurt in a moment," said Watch to that individual who could not refrain from popping his head to look at the cannon-shot skipping over the surface of the water till it sunk. "Down! I say; keep yourself safe while your are so. If you keep looking over that gunwale so eternally, I can't answer for the consequences." 
               "O, Mr. Watch!" returned Bladen, with a most doleful accent, "how can I help it? you don't take it into your consideration, that I was never in such a situation before. 
               "Lay down, my men," commanded Watch, in a deep stern tone; "they are preparing to give us a taste. Down, Binnacle; there is no bravery in exposing your life when you can effect no object." 
               A roar of artillery shook the vault of heaven; but happily without effecting much damage to the smugglers, who, bursting through the silence which followed Watch's orders, gave three cheers. 
               "Shall we run out the guns?" questioned Binnacle. 
               "Not till I order them, sir," replied Watch, sternly. 
               "Are we to stand shot all day without returning it," grumbled the smuggler. 
               "We shall have them alongside shortly," coolly observed the masterspirit of the contrabandists. 
               "And then"- 
               "Never fear: I'll sink them," 
               Onward came the cutter, careering before the wind, while the schooner, being kept on the starboard tack, had nearly got on the weather-beam of her foe, which, sailing with all her canvas set, her fore-sail half clued up to let the jib and fore-staysail draw, and better enable the helmsman to head his course in the smuggler's wake, had now come within fighting distance, leaving the schooner on her weather beam, from the supposition that she carried no metal, and would yield readily when she found it was impossible to make a further run. 
               The cutter had now got the land upon her larboard bow, when Watch wore round on the larboard tack, and before the revenue people were well aware of his intention, four twelve-pound carronades were run out, and poured in their fire beneath the water-streak with such terrific effect, that it tore away an entire plank. A cry of horror rose from the revenue cutter as the water rushed through; but a moment afterwards the men were piped below to repair the damage. Tarpaulin was nailed on to keep out the first rush of the water, and then a bit of sheathing to make all tight again: and before the smugglers were well awake from their surprise at the quickness with which they repaired the damage, three guns discharged from the cutter swept the schooner's deck, crippled her mainmast, and cut through her ice-shrouds as cleanly as if it had been done with a knife, while the crew looked aghast at an accident that now disabled the schooner to wear off shore on her larboard tack. 
               "What are you staring at, my lads? It might have been worse, as the Dutchman said when he broke his leg. Had it been out weather shrouds, the mast had gone over," cried Watch "Bring a gasket there to splice, and stand ready with your guns; point to the water's edge. After what we have done, better to sink than be taken." 
               "Stand ready!" said the smuggler chief, looking over the taffrail; "wait till I give the word before you fire." 
               Again there was a pause on board the schooner. 
               "Steady!" cried the leader. 
               "Ahl." said the men. 
               The cutter again sent a scattering fire among the spars and rigging of the contraband schooner, while her crew rushed to the deck to gaze on the effect produced on the daring smugglers who had thus pitted their lives against the laws of their country. They were seen but for a moment; for as the cutter heaved under the effect of her own broadside, Will Watch, who stood coolly marking the movements on board the revenue vessel, now gave the command. 
               "Fire!" 
               Again the desperate fire of the schooner struck the cutter below the water-mark, tearing out the new work; when, wearing her head round at the risk of losing his mast, the daring contrabandist run his vessel's head into the government cutter's quarter. She heeled over, the water rushing in in torrents. The revenue men below were overwhelmed by the rush of water. The remainder, cutlass in hand, clung to the rigging of the schooner's bowsprit, determined by a desperate effort to board and take the contrabandist, or perish in the attempt, since the loss of their own craft was inevitable. All other hope was vain. Their fine vessel, a few moments before gallantly riding on the crest of the waves, as if she owned no superior, filled fast, and sunk beneath the closing waters; while Watch endeavored to wear the schooner's head off shore, conscious that his last act had stamped him a pirate. 
               Though Lieutenant Rowcraft, who commanded the government cutter ter. (which was no other than the Wasp; its proper commander, having remained on shore to attend to the case of Ned Topman) was at first taken somewhat aback by the desperate certainty with which the schooner, had poured in her fires. Calmly he ordered the men to remove the guns, and so far repair the damage as to keep the cutter afloat; but when he saw the desperate manuvre of the contrabandist-when he saw the schooner's head bearing directly on the starboard quarter of his crippled craft, her bowsprit directed a-midships of the vessel he commanded-he gave her up for lost. 
               "My brave fellows," cried the lieutenant, "a few minutes and all may be over with us. We must die; yet let us not add cowardice to imprudence. We have but one chance of escape: it is to board the moment the schooner strikes us. A bold attempt, and she may be ours." 
               A violent crash succeeded, and in an instant the cracking timbers gave way to the antagonist force. 
               Rowcraft contrived to swing himself up and obtain a footing on the weather side of the bowsprit. 
               "On, boys, on!" Down with the rascally pirates!" shouted the Lieutenant, striking at the first smuggler he neared. 
               The seamen who, following his example, had desperately boarded the schooner, answered their leader's call with loud cheers, and making one of those forlorn hope charges, wherein assailants are often astonished at the success of their own temerity, despite the disparity of numbers, succeeded in driving some half-dozen smugglers a-midships, following them up, without giving them time to recover from the panic with which they were seized. 
               "Ha, ha! ya! Dere dem go! Dat dab gabberner cutt'r neber sturb us no more. Dar' say dat. Dem food for fishes. Massa dine a' de Dolpin, dar, say. Ha, ha! ya!" 
               A slash from the weapon of Lieutenant Rowcraft, however, put an end to the spirit of his joke, by cutting through his fell of wool in a lateral direction, even to the bone, half blinding him with the blood which, spurting out like a fountain, streamed into his eyes. 
               "What's the matter, Delaware?" cried the smuggler leader. 
               "A tink, massa, hib debbil hissalp hab boatded us in a high win'!" cried the negro; "here, bin' op my had, an' lat me hab anoder slap at dem! Begor, de ben co' bout de sea to pight us, it's by belip. I gor a pre'ous slap ob by'ed abong dem, sobbow; keep a good look-out too!" 
               "D--n!" muttered Watch; "one struggle, and we conquer. Bear a hand with the gun, d'ye hear! Remember not to fire until you see me clear in the boat." 
               Watch said no more, but, rushing forward with cutlass and pistol, he broke through the ranks, and for a moment staggered the assailing party while he endeavored to rally his dispirited men. 
               "On them, boys," he shouted. "Down with them." 
               When Rowcraft found he had only cut the lashings of the larboard-bow gun, to his own disappointment, he wasted no time in regaining the advantage he had lost in endeavouring to obtain means of commanding the smuggler's deck, and so placing her crew entirely at his mercy, he prepared to renew the contest hand to hand, and, followed by the two tars who had been assisting him in his late useless achievement of bringing an unloaded gun to bear upon the enemy, he rushed into the waist, or space between the schooner's main and formast, and, for the present, re-obtained the ascendancy in the struggle, inspiring his men with fresh courage by his fearlessness and intrepidity. 
               His quick sword whirled with the celerity of lightning, flashing in the eyes of his opponents, already daunted by the feeling that they were engaged in an unlawful struggle. 
               The smugglers began to give back. 
               "Cowards!" shouted their intrepid leader, rallying the retreating fight, "do ye shrink from danger to fall back on certain death? Forward, if ye would escape the gallows!" 
               And Watch's sword met Rowcraft's with such fury, that sparks flew with the splintered steel. Their fury suspended the exertions of the crews, who paused, as if by mutual consent, to view the combat of their leaders. 
               Hand to hand, foot to foot, eye to eye, they contended. They watched each other's movements with a jealous inspection that anticipated every attack; parrying artful thrusts, or warding off furious blows, with a skill and dexterity that proved them in the highest proficient in the science of attack and defence. Neither could, with justice, claim the superiority over his opponent. 
               The feats of swordsmanship on the part of the leaders filled the beholders with an admiration that for awhile suspended the battle, and held their followers on both sides in quiet, when Delaware Dick rushed in and restored the chance medley, by striking down with his cutlass the first revenue man he encountered. 
               "Tak' a dat poor by head, oo bite nigger!" he exclaimed, as the revenue man fell, "Oo look as if dere bere notin' to do but tare at do cap'n. By can't oo pite, oo barnacles?" 
               The skirmish having, as before stated, become general by the sudden irruption of Delaware Dick, Rowcroft and his men sturdily directed their efforts to drive the smugglers aft, following them foot by foot, and inch, as they retired before them-for retire they did, in spite of the efforts of Watch, and the fury of the negro. 
               Such was the state of the struggles on board the smuggling craft, when the Leiutenant, in making a desperate blow at the contrabandist leader, missed his foot and fell. 
               A deafening cheer spoke the smugglers' estimate of this advantage; but the revenue men fiercely returned the shout of their opponents, and making a sudden rush drove the contrabandists as far as the boat, and thus gave their officer an opportunity to regain his feet, when grasping his sword, he renewed his combat with the smuggler leader. 
               At this moment, when a feather's weight would have given the preponderance to either combatant, two revenue men had broken through the contending crowd of smugglers, and took up a position in the rear of their desperate leader. They have already reared their brawny arms to cut him down, when Binnacle, starting up, exclaimed- 
               "Will you see a friend assassinated, Bladen, with a handspike so near you!" and, rushing forward, heedless of his orders not to leave the gun, he cleft the head of the nearest revenue man, dividing it equally to the chin. 
               When the battle had approached so near him, the terrified Bladen seemed bereft of all power, giving himself up for lost-nay, hardly knowing whether he possessed life or not, so truly might he present the proverb, "more dead than alive." In this state of mind, the call of Binnacle produced a singular effect, and communicated a confused notion of the import of his words. An indistinct mass of objects seemed to float before him; the hum of battle bewildered him. Seizing the handspike, in blind obedience to Binnacle's command, he reared it above his head, and in the next moment it descended on the seaman's skull with such effect that his brains flew completely over his tremulous assassin, who throwing down the handspike, covered his face and rushed abaft, utterly afraid to look on the murder he had perpetrated. 
               The destruction of the two seamen had now reduced the number of the revenue people to six beside the Lieutenant; yet, knowing they could expect no quarter if taken, they still manfully contended against the increased odds, determined to sell their lives as dearly as possible. The negro, a moment afterwards, sent his opponent down by a tremendous blow, and dealing another to the seaman who contended next him, had cut his way even to the spot where Lieutenant Bowcraft still held the bold smuggler in play. 
               Delaware raised his cutlass, grinning savagely as he prepared to deal the blow which was to decide the Lieutenant's fate, when Watch, ashamed to have his work finished by another hand, exclaimed- 
               "Hold, Delaware! this is my foe." 
               "Is him, massa?" cried the negro; "den dis is de bas' bay to sarb 'm, I think, massa." 
               "Stay your hand!" commanded the smuggler chief; "two upon one is not fair sword-play." 
               "Oo s'uld hab tol' dat apore," said the negro, with a grin. 
               A fact which became apparent by the Lieutenant's falling, with his head severed by the fierce cut of the negro, while the latter flew to the assistance of his brother smugglers. 
               Thus reduced the remaining seamen, with the instinct of men accustomed to warlike daring, turned back to back, defending themselves against the furious assaults of the smugglers, who, surrounding them in a body, inflicted a wound at every blow, till they one by one fell on the deck, incapable of offering further assistance. 
               We have thus followed the eventful career of one of the most dashing and desperate outlaws that ever 'ploughed the sea,'-his further daring actions will be fully set forth in the interesting romance of SUSAN WYLIE; OR, THE SMUGGLER'S BRIDE. 
             
            THE END.
