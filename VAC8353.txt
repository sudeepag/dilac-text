"Our disguise will protect us," ald Joa
than.  "I walked yesterday thre0    il
parts of the.city, and everywhere I .sta-
ken for an Amhaarez.* Let as only be
careful to sustain our assumed character
well."
" How little knowledge of man must the
people of Jerusalemr ltive," said Simon, "If
they could take you for a simple and %50it-
orate peasant. But T fear the spies of He.
rod are better judges.of human countenan.
ces than the unsuspecting community.- We
must, before we go to the eouneil, aseert a
that we are not suspected at alt; for, if wp
are, we betray the place of meeting to the
vigilant spies, and this would bring misery
on our friends, and frustrate our schemes."
" But how will- you ascertain it ?" Jona-
than asked..                     '
" I do not know yet," said Simon;, "b  I
will see Abba Shaul and confer wi bj p-9
the subject."

,Jonathan cast a significant nor on Sipon,
and when t 4e,messenger was gone and the
peasantq ach went his way to amuse  ip
self, Simon whispered to Jonathan: 41I un-
derstand. the import of this measure.  It
would no$ do to arrest or molest oneo f those
whNrqme to Jerusalem to bring thef iret
fruits:; hence, before receiving as in solemn
procession, they want to ascertain, whether
no dangerous character is among the crowd;
[understand them well.'.
- "But this gives us also ample time to4
examine our path carefully," said Jonathafn.
" Let us, each for himself, wander through
the city and learn as much as we can."

THE CoMnAT C

")ate you heard from Jericho? have you
'% t'dg of'Hillel's son ? I have heard
year Jericho have come to pre
i   heir first fruits in the Temple.. Did
'heiotimprove this opportunity, to come in

eil ae r 'atsy moons of painful separa-
ib6? ' peak ' Abba Shaul, is he dead?
has he forgotten poor Helen ? or is he here
to renew the covenant of love? 0,I pray
you, speak, tell me all you know."
"Simon, Hillel's son lives," Abba Shaul
said; "he has not forgotten Helen, for his
love for her is imperishable as the powerful
'mina is that conceived it. I know of the
peasants' arrival, but whether Simon is
among them I can not tell. To morrow I
will know it. But, behold! there a peasant
comes from the city; so early, a peasant
from the city,,he is clad in his festive garb,
he weats a verdant wreath on his turban, it
is undoubtedly one of the men of Jericho.
Go to the vault and pray. I will ask him
and you shall have the answer. Sa you
are tired, wish to rest in my cottage, leave
your attendants outside, and I will tell you
all I learned."
She hastily threw the veil over her face,
and went to the vault. She was but a few
minutes gone when Simon ben Hillel alight-
ed from his ass, and was received, by Abba
Shaul, with a kiss impressed on the young
man's forehead.
" J9Iathan bent Uziel and I," said Simon,,
belittle louder than a whisper, "have come
among the peasants of Jericho with a mes-
sage of the scribes to the people's council of
Jerusalem. Can we deliver it without ap-
prehension ?"
" They watch closely every person coming
from Jericho,"'Abbar Shaul replied.  " It
would be marvelous, should they not regard
you among the .multitude, and none must
wait for miracles. Go back, and tell Jona-
than to be cautious. Go   about the city
till after the solemn rece . Keep your-
selves close to the other pasarits till dusk.

"Speak, my friend, I must, know your
heart," Ijelen said.
"My father stands high in the estimation
of those who know him," said Simon; "he
is the most respected among the Pharisees
and is a firm Pharisee himself. You know
the hatred and bitterness existing between
the Pharisees and Sadducees, especially
since the latter have sworn allegiance to
Herod. Your father, Sabion, noble Helen,
is an influential leader of the Sadduceea
who hates and despises the Plebian multi-
tude of Pharisees. _ It is next to an impos'
sibility for him thus far to condeseond, as to
give his daughter  in marriage, to an insignia
ficant Plebian, the son of an emigrant, an
obscure Pharisee. Do not deceivg your-
self, noble Helen, do not believe that your
father, the queen or any body else thinks,
feels and would act by your generous im-
pulse. I would only set you at war with
your father, with the queen, with all your
friends, without the least hope of a favor-
able result.- Helen, magnanimous virgin,
stainless soul, the ravine between you and
me is .too deep; the daughter of the Patri-
cian Sadducee and the son of the Plebian
Pharisee stand too far apart from each oth-
er. I feel my heart will break, joy will nev-
er smile on me again, love and happiness
are forlorn to me; but it must be. Better
now,when we alone know it,than after I have
caused you the painful misery of severing
your heart from your father and your
friends. Take this parting tear, as the ex-
pression of my breaking heart, hundreds
more will flow; but forget not, we have no
dominion over the unfortunate causes which
tear asunder the families, the most, sacred
ties of our country. Farewell, farewell,

Helen fell down upon her knees, lifted
up her hands to Simon, and prayed him
vehemently not to consider her a traitor.
Again and anon she prayed him, to change
his determination; but, when she found out,
that words were wasted in vain, she rose,
and with a manly resoluteness she stated:
"I can not, God witness, 1 can not leave
you; still I must hate him who schemes the
death of my father. I am determined to
die or to prevent -you from committing the

She was gone before Simon could reply,
leaving him in the most wretched condition,
tormented, tortured between-love and duty,
an. indomitable affection and a glowing .pat-
riotism. He had not much time to reflect
on his condition, for Abba Shaul- came in
and advised him, not to return to the city,
but to choose by-ways to reach his compan-
ions encamped outside the Fishgate. Simon
obeyed, silently. Thoughtfully he mounted
his ass and pursued the by-ways around thea
city as Abba Shaul had told him.

veled long after the soldier had gone, and
can not tell yet what all this means; but I
know we are betrayed and in imminent
dagger."
"This is marvelous, indeed," said Simon.
"We must take proper care to evade deted-
tion, and 1 have a good plan to do so. I
have a wealthy uncle, a brother of my fith-
er, whose co ntry residence is a few fur-
longs from ere. He has plenty of Babf-
lonian cost mes, and we have false beads,
which baffle detection. We speak well all
dialeAts of the  ramees and Chaldees.' Nat
far from here, a Babylonian caravan is en-
camped. Lee us dress at my uncle's, join
the caravan, hand be Babylonians for some
time. You know Herod favors all foreign-
ers, especially the Babylonians."
The plan was agreed upon. Both men
went away, unobserved, to carry out their
scheme. When scarcely gone, several 'fl-
core arrived among the peasants, and in-
formed them oftwo young men having come
up with them from Jericho, who must be
presented to the governor of the city. The
peasants were all assembled, every one's
name was asked, but none called himself
either Simon or Jonathan. On iuiry
whether any-was missing the officer' were
told, that all were present; none of the peas-
ants would have betrayed the two young
men, whose secret mission they appeared te

have guessed. The officers took two young
mew 'along, answering best to the descrip-
tion of the persons wanted, notwithstanding
the loud protests of the arrested and the
other peasants. The assurance that no
harm should be done to them, pacified the
agitated multitude, and they patiently await-
ed the result.  When, however, the next
morning the messengers of the Highpriest
care to array them in a solemn procession
to enter! the city, and the two peasants had
not returned; it took the whole influence of
the priests to pacify the agitated minds,
who considered, it an unpardonable sin,
that their two neighbors were prevented
kc    paying obedience to the law.
The procession was headed by the musi-
cians who, with their flutes, trumpets, cor-
nets, harps, cymbals and other instruments,
discussed Davidian music. Then were led the
sacrifices, the bullock first, his horns gilded,
on his head the olive crown, and the whole
animal was covered with fruits and flowers.
And then came the smaller animals, as ev-
ery comer thought proper to offer. One
brought a calf, another a lamb, the third a
young goat, as a peace-offering, a thank-offer-
iog, or to pay a vow, while others brought
their first born animals along to the priest.
All the, animals were more or less orna-
mented with fruits and flowers, each led by
a boy, who came up to see the city. Then
came the peasants, with their baskets of
gold, silver or palm branches filled with the
finest tropical fruits and ornamented with
Rowers, each carrying a pair of pigeons as
the requisite sacrifice. In the midst of the
procession was carried a large banner with
the shield of David and Judah's lion on it,
surrounded by palm trees, as Jericho was
commonly cal led the city of palms.
As they slowly moved toward the gate of
the city they sung, to the sound of music,
the one hundred and twenty second Psalm ;
'I am glad, I am glad
'in my soul, in my heart,
When they say: For the house
Of the lrd we'll depart.
Jeraatlem!I Jerusalem!
- Within thy gates our feet shall stand-.
Compaot and strong thou art, our gem,
Our joy, the queen of Judah's land.-

And to thee flock the tribes,
Come the tribes of the Lord--
Come with dance and with song,
And with thanks to the Lord.
For there the thrones of judgment stand

And there the throne of Israel's land
Once filled by David's royal race.
Do bid hail, greet with peace
Jerusalem's towers.
They prosper who do wreathe
With sweet love thy bowers.
May peace within thy walls abide,
And plenty in thy mansions be,
In thy Temple our God reside--
Jerusalem 1 be peace with thee."
. Arrived at the city gate, the procession
was received by the officiating priests, Le-
vites, treasurers of the Temple, and the re-
presentatives of the Israelites at the sanc-
tuary, all clad in their sacerdotal vestments,
bearing the banners and ensigns of the city
and the sanctuary. Before them went the.
Levites, with their cornets and trumpets,
and after them came the curious multitude.
Also, a deputation of the city bearing the
standard with the Ariel, a deputation of the
Sanhedrin carrying a representation of the
scroll of the Law, and the messengers of the
King, before whom a Roman standard, uni-
ted with Judah's lion, was carried, came
among the rest, to receive the strangers.
After lie deputy of the Highpriest had
spoken the blessing over them, the King's
messenger had promised them his protec-
tion, and the city authorities had offered
them the hospitality of the capitol, the re-
presentatives of the Sanhedrin admonished
them always to obey the will of God with a
willing heart. Then the procession organ-
ised again, and, with music and song, with
floating banners and standards, with numer-
ous ensigns and go    emblems, the gay
and delighted proc moved through the
city, through tl'een  crowds of' Jerusa-
lemites, country people, Egyptians, Ethiop-
ians, Arabs, Syrians, Babylonians, Persians,
Greeks and Romans, each in the peculiar
costume of his country. All the mechanics
rose from their seats, and each' greeted the
passing: "Our brethren, men of Jericho
welcome in peace."

of my illustrious father, come messengers
from the council of the Scribes, of Israel's
wise men, in the vicinity of Jerieho, thel

" Death to the intruder ! " several men
cried, and rushed toward her. Simon and
Abba Shaul protected her. " None shall

powerful man   thundered, swinging  his
sword. " Shed no innocent blood," Simon
cried, vehemently. "None shall die in Is-

law and justice: none shall die in Israel, un-
less the law commands his death," Baba ben

trial for her intrusion.

CHAPTER         II.
A SCENE IN THE ROYAL        PALACE.
Passing through the rows of palaces north
west of the theater, which stood nearly in
the center of Acra, or the Lower City, as one
part of Jerusalem was called-we stop before
a large park, in which nothing is omitted
which nature and art combined produce to
charm and captivate even the over-irritated
sensualist of tropical lands. The verdant
carpet variegated with Flora's blooming
children was intersected with shady walks,
while the palm tree, the cedar and the fig
tree stood peaceably together. There the
rich foliage of the vine protected an artesian
well from the heat of the sun ; here the olive
and Jericho's balm shrubs were intimately
crowded together, upon which the pomegran-
ate and the golden orange appeared to look
down with elated pride. Aloes and myrtles
by the side of lemon trees impregnated theI
air with their sweet scent, in rivalry with
their precious neighbors, the narcissus and
the clove.
We pass these shadowy ways, up the slight
declivity, and arrive before a magnificentI
palaceof Tuscan structure. Passingthrough
the- marble portal, we step into a square
Court surrounded by colossal columns, upon
which the front of the upper story rests.--
Under it, upon the mosaic floor, low chairs,
rich sofas, and little round tables are
placed. Sentinels and servants haste to and
fro, courtiers and high dignitaries in their
state costume come and go continually. Ev-
ery where, Grecian art and taste appear com-
bined with oriental luxury and royal opu-J

In the center of the saloon, on a platform
several steps high, covered with red velvet
interwoven with flowers of gold and silver,
there rested the rich sofa, on which the most
beautiful, Inost virtuous and at the same
time most unfortunate of Queens,Mariamne
the last daughter of the heroic family of the
Asmoneans sat. Her head reclined upon
her white; round arm, on which fell a profu-
sion of black tresses, contrasting beautifully
with the three strings of Persian pearls
around the head, to keep uncovered a prom-
inent and lilly white forehead. Her eyes
which, like two solitary stars glittered under
the dark brows, were fixed on her mother,
Alexandra, who sat on the sa e sofa, and
spoke to her on matters of mo entous in-
portance. None, beside the two ladies, wah
in the saloon. They spoke little louder than
a whisper, still we must know part of the
conversation.
" He is the father of my children," said
Mariamne, with much feeling, " I can not
consent to his destruction."
"And the murderer of your race," said
Alexandra, in a tone of bitterness, "the wil.
ful and malignant assassin of your brother,
Queen. Do you know, daughter, the heart,
the love, the inexpressible affections of a
mother, for her children ? Why, then,
would you not comprehend the pain, the un-
utterable affliction of a mother bereft of her

foul and cowardish intrigues, by a despotic
and self-deifying King? Why, then, would
you not understand the mother's intense de-
sire, to avenge her murdered child ?"
" Because it is ignoble and impious," said
Mariamne, briefly. "God who knows man's.

affair.. Woman's tears and her persuading
voice are insufficient to make me forget the
duties I owe to my King."
" And your only child's petitionY' Helen
asked.
" Is of no avail," Sabion replied. "I am
the King's servant"-
" And the peoples opponent," Helen re-
marked, imprudently. But, frightened by
her own words, she added, "Baruch ben
Menahem, the innocent Essenee, the son of
your King's friend, is my testimony."
Sabion scrutinized her sharply, with his
piercing look, which darted arrowlike from
his small black eyes. "Do you know this ?"
he asked, slowly and shrewdly. "Ah, I be-
lieve Simon ben Hillel told you. Therefore
he must die."
Helen trembled, when her father articula,
ted the last words, so firmly and resolutely,
that no doubt could be entertained as tp
their meaning. She quickly recovered her
self-possession, and asked, smilingly, her
father, " Would you have Simon ben Hillel

grave ?"
"Your lover, unhappy child ?" Sabion
asked, in a tone of consternation, "You do
not mean this, in earnest, my child,do you?"
"Whenever your anger will be over, I
will tell you truly, what knoww" Helen said.
"I speak not to Herod's.stern officer, I shall
gladly and sincerely speak to my father."
" Speak, my child," Sabion said, half smi-
ling, " but speak the truth and nothing but
the truth."
"I do my father," said Helen. "I lonv
but one man, I will ever love him only, and

After some reflection, she called Elvira.-
The girl came. " You are right, my good

informed him of my orders, and I despair."
"No cause for it," said Elvira, "I do not
know what interest you take in the two
young men; but I know themout of Sabion's
reach. "
" Where, my beloved sisterly friend, where

"I can not tell you, beloved Helen," El-

But he pushed me aside with the measuring

of others, I come to you, Hillel and ask you,
can you teach me your religionwhile I stand
on one foot?"
"Why art thou so in haste my son ?" Hil-
lel asked.
" Because I dislike to be much longer
among barbarians," the Greek answered,
saucily.
Hillel was silent for a moment, he appa-
rently reflected on a proper answer to the
insult offered him. Then he said in a mild
tone, "Thou mayest be right. I hear the'
Greeks are very wise, and it behooves thee
to live in a land of learned men."
" Is this all you have to tell me ?" the
Greek asked, somewhat embarrassed.
"If this is all thou wisheet to know, yes,"
Hillel responded, quietly,
"But, 1 wish to know your religion," the
Greek said.
"The Greeks are very wise, why should
they learn anything of barbarians ?" saidI
Hillel.
" Yes, indeed, they are very wise," said
the Greek, " but in Religion, it appears tome
they are quite foolish. Therefore I come to
learn of the barbarians."
"In what are the Greeks wise?" Hillel
asked.
"Ineverything, except Religion," theGreek
replied.
"Can the Greeks tell us, why and how we
andtbethingsaround us exist?" Hillel asked.
" Can they tell us, how the sun shines, the
thunder rolls,the hurricane roars, the oceanI

size of the heavens, the depth of the ocean
f or the compass of the air? And if they can-
not tell this in any time, why wouldet thou
assume to know the will of the Creator
I and Great Cause of all these things in
so short a time as thou canst stand on
one leg?"
"I am foolish, pardon me my venerablemas-
ter," the Greek said, overcome by the kind-
I ness of Hillel. "But I vowed a sacred vow
to Minerva, that if I could not learn the re-
ligion of the eastern Barbarians in as short
a time as I can stand on one leg, I would re-
turn and bring incense to her shrine. I
must keep my vow."
"Speak, I prithee," said Hillel; "If I had
vowed to my table to return to it and do
homage to it, must I do it ? Still this table
exists and Minerva exists nowhere."
"Minerva exist nowhere ? " the Greek
asked, astonished, " also not in Olymp?
Speak ! old sage. But no, speak not, I dare
not learn anything of you unless you can
teach me everything concerning your reli-
gion, while I can stand on one leg. I shall
not violate my vow."
" Before I do so," said Hillel, "let us un-
derstand each other what religion is. Is it
not to worship God or the gods, as He or
they wish it? and is not to do the will of God
or the gods, to worship Him or them ? Speak,
myAon, is it not so?"
"So it is," said the Greek, "I agree."
" Then, stand on one leg and hear my re-
ligion," said Hillel, solemnly, while rising.
The Greek looked with, surprise at the
straight, colossal figure of the ancient sage,
on assuming his position.
"Whatever hurts thee, thou shalt not do
thy neighbor," Hillel said, slowly. "This
is the principle part of my religion, the rest
is a mere explanation. Go and finish thy
studies."
The Greek stood awhile as though rooted
to the ground, gazing aghast into the open

" Then God will forgive thee," Hillel said,

" You first, noble, generous demi-god," the
Greek supplicated, kneeling before Hillel,
"you must first forgive the villain who has

"Rise, my son," Hillel said, "and remem-

me to pray thee for pardon, and not obtain
it? I have no grudge against thee, there is
nothing to be pardoned, rise and be hence-

" God will protect him," illel said, calm-

"Are you so sure of God's protection?"
the Greek asked.
"Sure, quite sure, my son," the sage re-
plied. "I hurt none, why should God hurt
me? God is the All-just. If He inflicts pun-

" But tell me, my master," said the Greek,

God gifted him with an active soul. The
great lesson he is commanded to study is to
hurt none, harm none. He must do some-
thing, so he can do but what is good."
"Did you not say God protects you ?" the
Greek asked ; " If so, how does he protect
you?"
"I know not how," said Hillel, "but I

kew he protects me. God has many me-

"And I will be one of them," said the
Greek, "I will practice the first lesson I
have received. I will goto Jerusalem, harm
none, hurt none, and protect your son. Then
Will return with him, and learn of you
my second lesson."
"Go with God, my son," said Hillel, "but
never forget my first lesson." He took a
spade from a corner of the room and went
to the door with the Greek, who asked him,
"What will you do with this spade Y"
"I will work in the garden " said the
sage. .,
"You will work ? no, you shall not," said
the Greek. "Here ii the money I was paid
for your life Itis enough tosupportyou and
your family one year."
"Whoever despises gifts will live," said
the sage, "so the wise King said; because
the poor only takes gifts, and the poor
is esteemed like the dead. I am not poor,
I can work."
.The Greek finding his repeated attempts;
togive Hillel the money a vain and fruitless
task, asked again: " Why should not your
wife and children work for you ?"
"Because it is my duty to support them,"
said Hillel. "My wife and my children are
my best friends, the partners of my joy as
of my aMiction; why should I not work with
them ?"
"You should not work at all," said the
Greek, "you are so wise and learned in your
Jaw, that others should work for you while
you study for them."
"None can study for his neighbor," said
Hillel. "If thou knowest much, do not
think more of thyself on that account; for
thouart created to this- very purpose. De-
grade wisdom not to a stepping stone to
wqlth and honors, or to a spade to dig for a
sausen ce.. Whoever wears the Toga chang-
N (pr the worse; for honors and wealth are
dggerous companions."
By that time they had come to the end of
thq garde. A clamor of wo was heard in
thl, neighborhood. The stranger turned
quickly round, looking toward the cottage.
Hillel- smiled. " Fear not, stranger, the

noise is not in my house," said he, "for
God protects it, and my wife and children
cry not if a misfortune befall them. They
know that no actual evil can befall them."
Astonished and heartily admiring the man
of a thousand virtues, the Greek leaving Hil-
lel wished to return to Jerusalem.
"Let us go and see what this noise means,"
said Hillel.
" I will go and inquire," said the Greek,
"you must'not leave your study ; for you
are a wise man, every moment you spend
outside of your study is a loss to you and to
your people's literature."
" Would I like to cry for help, or lament
over my misfortune, and none come either
to assist or console me?" Hillel asked. "If
you are wiser than the rest, you are expect-
ed to do more than they do; for if wisdom
is not a prompter to 'noble actions, it is a
dead treasure in the hands of an avaricious
man. He, whose wisdom is greater than
his virtuous actions, compares to a tree with
wide.stretched branches, a rich foliage and
small roots, the slightest storm will up-
set it.  He, whose virtuous actions pre-
dominate over his wisdom compares to a
tree with small branches, a thin foliage and'
powerful roots, all the hurricanes may rage
against it, still they will not move it from
its place. Let trunk and branches be strong
and large, the foliage rich, and the root$
powerful, and stand fearless in the storm.--
Come,my son, let us see whence the calamity
comes. Let us help them if we can, or con-
sole them, if help is impossible."
The Greek kissed the garment, of the old.
sage, and followed him silently. In the
central market space of Jericho, under the
palm trees, a large concourse of people met,
clamors of grief and woe were heard among
them, and the name of Baruch ben Mena-
hem was connected with the accents of la-
mentation.
"The dead body of Baruch ben Menahem
was fodnd in a street of Jerusalem," said
one, in reply to Hillel's inquiry ; "they
brought it home to the woe-stricken parents.
He was Menahem's only son."
" The lanes of Jerusalem are soiled with
blood," one exolalmed, "the holy oity is de-

fled by'the .hands of assassins. The best
and nadstgodly are daily killed and thrown
in :the street as the 'mud, the nuisance of
the houses."
Meanwhile the multitude had rapidly in-
ereased, the murmurs and the lamentations
had become louder and more painful, and
.the indignation of the populace had grown
into fierce wrath.  Their etump of' an old
palm tree was mounted by  a young man
who, waving with his hands, bid'silence.
"Be silent here and listen," one admon-
ished the other, "Jonathan, Uziel's sagaci.
eus son wishes to speak to you." The mul-
titude listened, when he said: " Men, and
brethren, Menahem'e only son, 'Barueh,
among the good and noble the best and
most'-generous youth, Jericho's pride, a
wretched mother's only love, has been,
found slain in the streets of Jerusalem.
How could she become.a harlot, the faith,
ful fortress, justice once dwelt in her, and
now murderers."
' Accents Of weeping and lamentation, pro-
ceeding from the agitated-multitude, inter-
rupted the speaker, who continued after
awhile: " Tell it not in- Gath, bring not the
terrific tidings to the market spaces of~sca-
Ion, unless Our enemies would rejoice over
our downfall, our adversaries laugh at our
degradation.' Let the daughters of Zion
dress 'in mourning and weep over their
loss; fdr Menahem's son, the faireft of men,
has 'been found slain in the streets of Jeru-

'Again, the voices of lamentation and
weeping interrupted the speaker; but he
resumed after awhile: "Know ye, men and
brethren, no 'heifer's neck will be broken,
no judges will - wash their: hands over the
spot where the corpse was found and say:

the multitude cried, "we may 'judge a hire-

"&amp;Hi1Ie1 speaks, be silent, Hillel speaks,"

"-The;King is no less subject to the Laws
of God, than the humblest of his subjects,"
I said hillel. 49If the King is a criminal, the
t laws prescribe his punishment. The mur-
derer'should be taken even from God's a-
ored altar, if he be the Highpriest and woi
ship God in behalf of Israel -and receive
the punishment due to him. Whoever spills
the blood of man, his blood will be shed by
man, such is the wise decree of Providence.
If you know Herod and Sabion to be guilty of
this crime, you may condemn them, but you
can not execute your judgment on the cul-
prits. You are weak and they are powerful,
you are a few and they are many, you are in
Jericho and they are in Jerusalem. There-
fore let us not waste words. Mournover the
dead, console the bereft parents, and return
each to his house, God will judge and pun-
ish the guilty. -Wait, my people, wait pa-
tiently until the day of divine vengeance
comes, then the wicked will be punished,
and the righteous will be-triumphant."
A body of Egyptian soldiers arrived at the
spot to disperse the crowd, the eloquence of
Hillel and his influence over Jonathan ben
Uziel prevented the outbreak of serious dis-
turbances.,,
" Woe unto thee, Judah," Jonathan ben
Uziel cried, on entering the hall of Gurion,
where the sages held their meetings, " woe
unto Israel, that Egyptians rule over thee
and disturb thy councils. Let every patriot
clothe in sack and ashes and cry woe, that
the birds stop their merry melodies, Tabor
and Hermon pour down currents of tears to
drown the beauty of the valleys. Let Jor-
dan's waters be congealed with shame, and'
the hot springs of Tiberias be frozen with
consternation, on account of the strangers
who set their feet on the neck of Israel, and
trample the daughter of Zion in the duet."
The sages and scribes assembled in the
hall listened with much sympathy to the
outpouring of offended and wounded senti-
ments, and none interrupted the young man.
Apparently overcome by his painful emo-
tions, he stopped awhile, then he resumed:
"if this is the will of Cleopatra, if she
has taken possession of Jericho, that we be
not allowed to speak out what we think,

about in the hall as though his looks in- lent, like Jonathan ben Usiel, w kanUbe

tended to subjugate every heart, he said
slowly and sonorously: " Are you not glad
to be protected by Cleopatra against the
will of Herod, who massacred as many of
your colleagues as fell in his hands, why
would you trouble her with complaints ?
Or do you wish to occasion her to withdraw
her protection from this city ; where will
you meet, where live, where maintain and'
promulgate the sacred traditions of our na-
tion ? Uziel's sagacious son is beyond the
venomous eye of suspicion, his motives are
undoubtedly pure and patriotic, his pur.
poses pious and godly ; none dare question
the wisdom of Hillel's most renowned pu-
pil, and none should oppose his opinions.
But, my hair begins to be grey, stored away
in my memory lies the history of half a een-
tury, au 'bloody, unfortunate and disastrous
to Israel, as the days of Syrian oppression.
I have seen a King who committed fratri-
cide, and a prince who appealed to a for.
eign power, to slaughter his own people and
secure him the throne of his fathers. I
have seen the brother in arms against his
own brother, and cruelties. and inhuman
outrages, innumerable almost, committed by
the combatting parties, who soiled the earth
with blood, and filled the la  with misery
and sre affliction. Still, very party ap-
pealed to the people, and each found its
zealous supporters. The people are wither
ing leaves, every wind can carry them off to
any direction. The people are slumbering
sparks, harmless and unconscious of their
monstrous strength. My people bleed from
a thousand wounds and Jonathan ben Uziel
pours vinegar into the aching bruises. Woe

We have a King who-is epable of main

country, and none can hinder him. Pob.

wishes to study the Law, let him come to

"If this is your will, my father," said
Helen, " then give me a token, that such is
your. paternal wish, a token which I oan-
show the young physician.. He is meek
and bashful beyond description. He sever
would have the courage to .ask my hand
from you, if I could not encourage him with
some token."
"Here is the ring which I received of
Cleopatra, as a token of her esteem," Bald
the father. "This ring is valuable and' of
particular interest to me. I entrust it into
your hands as a token of my wish, that you
be the wife of Aurion, the King's body phy-
sician."
She grasped the ring so eagerly, and cov-
ered the hand of her father with so many
kisses, that he was baffled with the unex-
pected change in Helen's mind. He 'left
her fully satisfied, that he had carried out
well, his part of the plot. He was scarcely
gone when Simon paid Helen a visit. "Au-
rio, body physician of the King;" said Hel-
en, " what signifies this precious ring? Es-
senee, sagacious and sapient, tell me the im-*
port of this costly jewel."
Simon scarcely knew how to account for
the happy humor of his beloved. He in-
spected the ring closely, then he said, "It is
your father's ring, I saw it on his finger ;
hence it signifies a new trick or trap."
" How unkind you are s" Helen said.
"The ring signifies the wish and will of
my father, that I be your bride, your wife,

earnestly, to love the young physician,

the\Uod of Israel, it is a plot. Either this
is intended to restore his inuence over the
King, by my agency, or to ruin me. Dear-
est beloved Helen, caution, very sagacious
caution is necessary in this affair. I re-
membernow, that he told me of the King's
sister who wished my company. She is the
worst trickster at the court, I must see
her, to ascertain what this means; for your
father had a long conversation with her this
morning. Let them plot as much as they
please, if you will be wise, we will make the
best of it. But at present I advise you, to
tell your father, that I was so cool and dis-
tant, that it is very hard to gain access to
mkt heart. Still, take care of the ring, we
might t need it.
"It is strange, that you suspect every
thing proceeding from my father," said Hel-
en, in an offended tone. "If he is ever so
wicked, has he not a paternal heart?" -
"No, he has not," Simon interrupted, "1
know he has not. He informed Herod of
the supposed crimes of his own child, just
to ingratiate himself in his lord's favor. He
just as easy will dispose of you in any way
to suit his selfish designs. But, we must be
wiser than those corrupted courtiers. Ours
is the sagacity of love, the boldness of jus.
tice, and the firmness of virtue. Helen, they
shall not deceive us. I must now see He-
rod, he called me ; then I will see his plot-
tin sister, and teach her a lesson on plots
and counterplots."
Herod was alone when Simon entered the
saloon. Without giving him time to.utter
one word Herod asked hastily, " Well, my
faithful Aurion, have you ascertained any
thing in regard to the conspiracy ?"
"1I have ascertained more than sufficient
to convince you, my lord, of the hazardous
game you play with your people, by the
wicked advice of your courtiers," said he.
" But, before Ispeak, permit me to ask you,

this direct and perplexing question. Simon
continued not, and Herod was obliged to
say something. " Why do you ask me this
question ?" h~e said.

" Because,,if this is the ease," wtboe

ness is her influence over Antony, which
she has by her beauty, a beauty that just
begins to fade away. Make your appear-

midable for her in the eyes of Antony, that
she should not do any and every thing to get
you away, far away from her lord. He will
anyhow be induced to comply with your
wishes."
Mariamne made no reply.   Displeasure
and mortification were visibly depicted on
her pale countenance. Alexandra, however,
continued speaking on that topic and praised
Mariamne's charms so much, that she ex-
claimed in a tone of disgust, "The daughter
of the Asmoneans, Israel's Queen, the moth-
er of Judah's princes should vie with a har-
lot for the favor of voluptuous Antony? No,
I shall not. I prefer the scaffold to shame,
and the greatest shame is that which we pro-
cure with the charms God has bestowed on
us, at the expense of innocence and purity.
Mother, I caution you, not to bring misery
upon yourself- and my grandfather, and
shame upon your family. A princess should
know how to die honorably and bravely for
the glory of her house, in preference to liv-
ing covered with shame, a stain upon the
name of hei house. Let Cleopatra's name
be handed over to infamy, the Asmonean
sun shall have no spots on account of suffer-
ing Mariamne. Mother, it appears as though
we have changed parts in this tragedy. Let
us. stop here."
The earnest, high toned language of Mari-
amne failed not to impress her mother with
the conviction, that she could not be persua-'
ded ;o leave Jerusalem, or turn a traitor to
her husband. She gave the conversation
another turn by speaking of the unexpected
progress which the Essenean physician made
so rapidly in Herod's favor. "AWe could de-.
rive many a benefit from the young man,"
said Alexandra, after awhile. "It appears to

me, that he stands as high in the etimation
of the people as in the favor of Herod. The
people are our guardians, if they ha4 the
power."
"I remember now," said the Queen ud-
denly, "when sick, lying in a state Qf -derle

may be something better iq that man than I

me. I must see that young Essenee.-Moth-
er, do you know the Pharasee Hillel?
" Pet, mention not the name of a man,"
said Alexandra, "who is a horror to Sabion

whispering, "he is known as an opponent of
Herod and a friend of the Asmdieans. His
influence, notwithstanding his poverty, is
great, very great. But what makes you ask
this question ?"
"The Essenee Physician is the= son of
Hillel," the Queen answered.
"Then we should, we must see and study
him," said Alexandra. "The son can not
be altogether averse to his father."
"But we must be very careful with him,
for lie is very shrewd," the Queen rema*ked.
"Attempt to form his acquaintance, inquire
into his purposes and intentions, and let us
see what we can do with him."

The usual phraseology of court chats was
interrupted by Simon with the question,
"You expressed the wish, my lady, to see
me, and I gave myself the pleasure to make
my appearance in your saloon. If you de-
sire me to render you any service, I am at
your command."
"Very polite, sir, and very obliging," said
the lady. " When I wished to see you, it

quainted with the man of whom my royal

lny beauty, his sublime virtues, his bene-

care and trouble, and the hopes stored in
his~ future. Disgusted, Simon yielded and
Iteped with aversion to the flatteries with
eril he was overpowered. He looked es-

TI   PEOPLE,
pecially with contempt upon Castobarus,
who appeared to be the re-echo of the royal
dame. The man with his small gray eyes
and ever smiling countenance appeared to
him like an automaton, whose locomotive
power was the will of the lady. He remem-
bered the description which Herod, in a
moment of excitement, gave of his courtiers
and servants; an exact specimen was now
before him.
"1I doubt, my lady," said Simon, "that I
will meet, for a long time, with the favor of
our sovereign.  The novelty of my plain
and simple deportment will not please him
long, I apprehend, and -I doubt that I over
will be capable of acquiring that politeness,
that courtesy and accomplishment, which
distinguishes so eminently the hightoned la-
dies and gentlemen of this court."
" Wisdom and virtue stand aloof of all
forms," said Salome, "because they need
not that embellishment, in which empty
heads and vicious hearts hide themselves.
The King values the diamond but cares lit-
tle for its encasement. He will always res.
pect and.love you, and you can render in-
valuable services to him and our people."-
" The King will appreciate and reward
your services," said Castobarus, with a bow,
"and the people's gratitude will be great
and everlasting; for a people forget' not
their benefactors."
Simon deciphered at once the object of
this conversation, and with the adroitness
of a practiced courtier he responded, quick-
ly, "I am fully satisfied with our monarch's
grace and your kindness, for all the services
I am capable to render. A service render-
ed to a monarch must also be one to the
people, for he is the people's head. The

Menahem then narrated the story, how
his sen was found slain in the city of Jeru-
salem, and how several officers came to this
city to arrest a Greek, as being the murder-
er of his son, but the people insisted upon
trying the case before the Sanhedrin of Je-
richo.- He concluded with the considera-
tion, that the Sanhedrin of Jericho had no
right to try a man for crime which he
committed in Jerusalem. He thought the
duty of the Sanhedrin was to ordain that
the Greek be placed before the Sanhedrin
of Jerusalem.
When Menahem had resumed his seat,
Jonathan ben Uziel rose on the opposite

and replied; "Moses pointed on three cities

emnly to speak the truth before God, at the
sacred seat of justice, all except one were
led into an adjoining chamber, and one af-
ter the other was examined and cross ex-
amined. Aware of the severity of the law,
and knowing the unexceptionable justice of
the Pharasees, the-officers only stated, tlat
they were sent to Jericho by Sabion, in the
name of the lower Sanhedrin of Jerusalem,
who considered the Greek guilty of the
murder of Baruch ben Menahem. Noth-
ing more could be learned of them. When
Jonathan asked the multitude whether there
were witnesses in favor of the Greek, two
peasants came forward and told the story, -
how they when taking the first fruits to Je-
rusalem were arrested by the men now be-
fore the judges, taking them for two other
men, and how they were treated until a
party of strangers rescued them from their
hands in the Valley of Ilinom.
It was evident to the initiated, that the'
officers were the servants and spies of Sa-
bion. The first idea of many was, those
spies came for a double purpose, to arrest
the Greek in order to remove the suspicion
of murder from Herod and his servants,.and
to ascertain the doings of the Pharasees
at Jericho. Abba Shaul's testimony only
confirmed that of the peasants, but threw
no light on the principal point of the case.
When Jonathan asked again, " Are there
any more witnesses among you?" a boy
whom Jonathan instantly recognized as the
one who was his guardian angel in Jerusa-
lem, came up and stated, "I am a servant
of Sabion's daughter. I saw Baruch ben
Menahem in the subterranean room of He-
rod's palace. The men before you tortured
him till he died. They executed the com-
mand of Sabion, which he received of lie-
rod. 1 administered the last drops of water
to the parched lips of the expiring victim of
wickedness. When 1 wept, yonder wretch-
ed man dragged me out of the room, and
there I heard the last groan of Baruch. So
help me God, now and forever."
Two men supported Menahem who sunk,
fainting, from his seat. "1 can tell you
still more," said the bay. "This Greek was

dignation of the people became so loud and
violent, that it was difficult even for Abba

the crowd after the mysterious boy; he had
disappeared.
" I know everything thou cast tell me,"
said Hillel to his son Simon, "The Greek
proselyte has told me, how thou art the phy-

Behold ! my mother was a daughter of the
royal house of David, and my father was a
nobleman of Benjamin, of King Saul, some

great and good woman, Ahe called me to her
couch, and bid me to bring honor upon our
family. Her voice always re-echoed in my
heart. As Joseph saw the portrait of his
father when sin threatened to beguile him,
so did I see on all occasions the picture of
my dying mother, and heard her last words,
'Bring honor uponour family.' I began to

THE DECISION oP THE PEOPLE.
East of the Jordan river, opposite Jericho,
Mount Nebo looks down upon the plain of
Moab, and tells the glorious story of Israel's
victories under the lead of Moses, the last
days of that giant of antiquity, his death
and mysterious burial. There is a cave in
Mount Nebo, in which the prophets held
their secret councils, when the Kings of Is-
rael or Judah went astray; in that cave the
prophet Elija was hid, and the people sur-
rounded it with a thousand marvelous sto-
ries. The cave after many windings, as-
cends and descends, leads to a valley thro'
which the Zered passes, a valley almost in-
aceessible from any other point, as the Ze-
red winds its way to it through perpendiou-
lar rocks and narrow arches, and leaves it
In the same manner. Thealm trees which
crowd the fertile valley of a perpetual
spring gave shelter and food to many fugi-
tives. It was the principal place of meet
ing for secret bodies. It was, therefore,
called the valley of Zanaim, or the.humble.
Many a solitary wanderer at that day bent
his steps toward Nebo, some riding on as-
ses, while others walked slowly over the
plain with rude staffs in their hands. At
she mysterious cave a fire burnt, around
which some fantastical shepherds danced

would ask him, " Whence comet thou and

same questions which Simon and Jonathan
were asked on entering the secret hall un-
f der the Temple of Jerusalem. The answers
being correct they were given another lead-
er to the valley of Zanaim. But if the an-
swers could not be given they were led in-
to a branch of the cave, where they were in-
structed in the secrete and sworn to support
the revolution.
The valley was soon filled with a large
number of bearded men, upon whose coun-
tenances a solemn earnestness was enthron-
ed. They stood or laid together in groups,
and conversed on serious topics.
"Hark! Jonathan ben Usiei speaks," said
some. "He w'as in Alexandra and knows a
great many new things." The crowd con-
gregated around the speaker, who gave a
full description of the grand preparations
making by A ntony to meet the armies of
Octavius. He said that Cleopatra promis-
ed, none should interfere with the people of
Jericho as long as it was under her protec-
tion. She issued orders to give effect to her
words. "She also promised her aid and co-
operation in case of revolution against He-
rod whom she hates violently. But all this
is of no particular consequence to us, "Jon-
athan continued, " for if Cleopatra aids us
she will long after the land of Judah, and
Antony will give it to her, if he is the only
lord of the Roman empire. What pirot is
it to us to serve Cleopatra instead of le-
rod?"
" First let us dethrone Herod," some of
the crowd vociferated, " then let us talk of
the intentions of Cleopatra."
" So it is," said Jonathan, " we are strong
enough to dethrone our tyrant. If An-
tony is victorious, Cleopatra will prevent
him at least from supporting Herod. If Oo-
tavius is the hero of &amp; e day, we have noth-
lag to fear of him; for Herod supports An-

DAY OF ATONEMENT.
The streets and lanes of Jerusalem were
thronged with people at an early hour of,
the morning. A checkered line of human
beings floated through' the avenues, and
rose like gigantic and variegated columns
to Mount Mioriah, where the morning dawn
was greeted with the powerful and harmo-
nious accords of the levitioal chorus and
orchestra. The Hallelujah of the mighty
chorus was borne aloft to the blue vault of
heaven, on the wings of harmonious music,
in which the powerful notes of the trumpet,
cornet, and drum were blended with sweet
* sounds of the flute, the cymbal, harp and
eytrum. Solemnly these currents of mu-
sic re-echoed in the colossal dome, greeted
and invited the thousands of pilgrims who
hatuned toward the sacred spot.

look followed the stately procession, buit
none spoke or bowed.
But when the Highpriest appeared in the
white, sacerdotal vestments of the day, and
approached the sacrifice between the UNam
and the altar, a sacred awe appeared to
electrify the multitude. The chorus and
orchestra were silent, the myriads of wor-
shippers presented a smooth sea untouched
by the wings of the wind, the Highpriest
laid his hand on the head of the sacrifice
and confessing his sins he implored God's
pardon with a loud and sonorous voice, con-
eluding with the scriptural passage, "For
this day I will be appeased unto you to pu-
rify you from all your sins before God,"
here he stopped abruptly;. for as he pro-

-So the day was spent until the signal was
given from the Temple roof, that the High-
priest left the Temple, when the different
groups and companies returned with song
and music to the city.
Simon and Jonathan went the whole day
from one public place to another, to as-
certain something of Helen's whereabouts.
But in vain, they had discovered no trace,
not even the remotest idea of her place of
existence could be formed. But Jonathan
had seen Elvira'in woman's dress. She ap-
peared so beautiful to him, that he could
not help thinking of her all day. They had
returned to the city. Jonathan went to the
place which Simon had told him to choose,
and Simon went to the palace to see Herod.
Arrived at the palace, Simon was request-
ed to appear instantly before the Queen.
This was a welcome opportunity to him, as'
he expected to learn something about Helen.
He repaired to the Queen's apartment with-
out delay. He was admitted without cere
mony. When he stepped into the brightly
illuminated saloon and cast a shy look on
the great and beautiful woman in the flow-
ing white robe, who received him standing,
a model statue of a model artiot--when his
look met the large black eyes of the Queen
staring obliquely on him, he inadvertently
knelt down before the majestic daughter of
the Asmoneans.
"Rise and stand erect," said Mariamne,
" none must bend his knee before a mortal
being. This homage is due to God only."
Simon rose and looked firmly into the
countenance of the Queen. There wm a
pride and a self-conscious majesty in that
countenance, softened by features of the
most tender goodness, which he had
never observed before. "You are the im-
age of God, my gracious Queen," said Si-
mon in a fascinating tone, "I adore the
Creator in His most perfect'likeness."
The Queen smiled on remarking, "is thisn
the language of the stern Esene or of th
courtieri "

" It is neither," Simon replied, quickly ;
" for truth is not in the extremes."
"Then let Hillel's son speak to me in his
honest, free manner," said the Queen, while
resuming a seat. "I know shit you have
been my savior, when Herod suspected me
of treachery. Elvira, in the anguish of her
soul when Helen was lost, told me more
than I expected. 1 know of your laudable
affection for Helen, her unlimited love for*

ocned his eyes, and, beholding ihelen, he
sighed heavily and trembled v'atlently: He
closed and opened his eyes several times in
quick succession, and, seeing Helen always
before him, he cried with all his strength,
"Away, spirit of vengeance, and let me die
in peace."
"I am no spirit," Helen said, kindly lay-
ing her hand upon his forehead. "Can I do
nothing for you?"
Again he opened his eyes and stared at
her. Then he clasped her hand and asked
her, "Did you escape ?"
" I did, God rotected me," said Helen.-
"And Adarmelech did not succeed ?"--the
man asked, eagerly.
Helen, blushed. " How do you know the
schemes of that man ?" she inquired.
" I brought him the command from Sa
lome," the man stammered. "She insisted
upon the violation of your person. She loves
hint who loves. you. God has punished us
al. ' The eahtbquake saved you. Return
not to Jerusalem. Your ruin is inevitable.
Pray for me, I die. I am a loathsome sin-
ner." These were his last words, a few mo
ments more and he was dead. Helen shud-
dered at the gold-blooded wickedness of Sa-
lome. A chill of terror and disgust coursed
through'her blood on looking at the dead
man before her. She remembered the scene'
of scandal between her father, Salome and
(astobarus, which nearly cost her liberty
and life. She also remembered the wicked-
ness of her father, and;wretehed, mortified
ani disgusted she pressed -her hands upon,

Queen, she gave me leave and protection to"

Here I learned that he went to the country
house of your father, and intended to follow
him instantly, when the earthquake grew so
furious, that we could not leave: In the
confusion here, I heard the voice of Abba
Shaul, and he told me that you were here."
After an exchange of the fondest senti-
ments, Helen first communicated the story
of the last day. Then she spoke of the for-
mer part of her story  On coming to the
wife of the steward, Elvira interrupted her,
" Is she alsodead ?" When Helen aflirned

and fondness of her.
There was no time left for further explana-
tion, for Abba Shaul came and urged them
both to leave, which they did instantly. El-
vira urged that all should return to Jerusa-
lem, as the Queen would protect them against
every harm. Abba Shaul, however, insisted,
that Helen should go .to Jericho, and wait
there until Simon be infornned of lier fate,
and he should tell where- she shloul4 go.-
Helen preferred the latter. Elvira vs sent
to Jerusalem with the instruction to inform

Herod, on leaving Jerusalem appointed Sabi-

supreme in Jerusalem," said Jonathan; "ev-

terror never was felt in Jerusalem. Hlyrean
is accused before the Sanhedrin, in the name
of the King, of high treason. According to
o::: advice Hillel, our great teacher is his
'ounsellor, and will appear for him before
the Sanhedrin. Herod sent a written-grant,
that under no consideration should Hillel be
harmed, and after the trial he should go
back unmolested to Jericho. Although they
have no men to oppose effectually the argu-
ments of Hillel, we still apprehend fatal con-
sequences, as almost the whole Sanhedrin
consists of Herod's creatures. Still we shall
be watchful on this point. The most impor-

"Then you refuse to go with me?" the of-

" You understood me right," Simon repli-

him again to pay obedience to the laws of

then commanded the crowd to give way,
that he might do his duty, in arresting a
man who was accused of high treason, and
place him before the tribunal of justice.-
Hisses, groans and menaces were the replies
of the people.

was his time to carry out his schemes. He
sat in his easy chair one morning and heard,
the several reports of his servants with a
self-complacent air. After he was through
and the servants were dismissed, he called
Elvira. She appeared. Sabion Basked her,
" Will you now tell me all you know about
Helen and Aurion ?"
"You know more than I do, sir," said
Elvira. " I can tell you nothing. But if I
could, Iwould not do it."
"Ah, I know of proper means to bend the
obstinacy of such creatures," said 6abion.'
" The torture, Miss, the torture will teach
you to speak."  Elvira made no reply.--
" Will you answer my questions ?"
"No," was the brief answer. "Your con-
temptible menaces frighten me nat. Since
you threaten I shall not speak at all."
" Then I will not threaten," said Sabion,
" I will promise. If you tell me what you
know, I will elevate you to the first lady of
the court. The women shall envy, the men'
shall respect you, as the most powerful, most
influential, most happy lady at court. Ev-
ery look of yours shall set a host of servants
in motion. The finest silks of Damascus,
the linen of Egypt, the purple of India, the
pearls of Persia, the costliest diamonds, the
most precious rubies shall be yours. I will
make you my wife."
Elvira laughed so heartily that Sabion'
stopped abruptly. "This is a mast cruel
torture you have invented," she said; "in-
deed if I fear anything, it is certainly this
torture. Your wife ? What a hell there is
in these two words ! 0, do not deceive your-
self, my 'lord, you are so old and ugly, so
despicable and monstrous, that to be your
wife is to be wedded to hell and the prince
of darkness."
" Never mind,. Elvira," Sabion ejaculated.
"First,,tell me what you know of Hel-
en, then you will be my wife. I am lord,

are too mean a man to know what a woman
can do, if despair drives her .to it."
"You shall stay in your room for three
lays," said Sabion; "some gentlemen and
ladies are appointed to keep you safely. I
have urgent business just now. After three
days, I will marry you. Farewell."
" During three days it might please his
Satanic majesty to recall his representative
on earth to the hellish palace," said Elvira,
when she retired.
" Then I will take you along," said Sabion.
When Elvira was gone he soliloquized, "She
must know more than I do; for she was in
Sharon and that hellish Aurion came with
her, or soon after her from there. They
must know whether she is dead."
Knocking on the secret door was heard ;
Sabion opened and admitted a man.  Ah,

bring from-the plain of Sharon?"
9 Disastrous,very disastrous," said thestran-
ger. "I had a narrow escape. All the peas-
ants are under arms. Not a man of your
soldiers sent there will ever return. Some
are killed, and the rest frat  rnized with the
people."
" And they did not return with you ? "--
Sabion asked.
"Return? there was none there to return,"
said the man; " for their defeat occurred
just when they arrived on the plain and at-
tempted to arrest Aurion."
"A'nd all the reports I received after.

" Were lies, mere fabrications of your en-

" Our walls are strong enough, to make us

was closed, because it was considered com- Baba ben Buta, the blind president of the

plete. The crime of high treason could be
made no clearer to the Sanhedrin, than the
present testimony did. The connection of
Hyroan with the enemy of the country in
time of actual war, the acceptance of the
horses sent by Malchus, the orders to his
servants to prepare speedily to leave the city,
the promise of office to so many of his
friends, and the assurance that he would be
King in a few months, leave no room to doubt
the guilt of Hyrcan.
Hillel rose and said, that the argument
just heard would be conclusive, if the prem-
ises were true. He proposed to prove, that
not one of the premises was t. ne. The pri-
vate scribe of Hyrcan testified, that the old
King was incapable to write, more than three
years past, partly on account of his weak eye-
sight, and partly on account of trembling'
hands. The letter to the King of Arabia
must have been written years ago. Upon in-
vestigation it was found by many witnesses
that names and date were skilfully changed
in the letter. Another witness stated, that
the Arab was a horse trader, commonly1
,known as such in Jerusalem, and never was
an agent of the King of Arabia. Next an
'Arabian Israelite was heard who stated that
his 1grethren, residents of Arabia, sent Hyr-
can is present of several horses through the
very man, who says he is an agent of Mal-
chus. The two chamberlains of Hyrcan
stated, that his body servants were suspect-
r.ed'of'evil intentions toward Hyrcan, and be-
is  emved from their fanotions, six months
ago, received a pension, but were never again
admitted into the presence of the old King.

people's council-was introduced. On exam-
ination he stated, that he was an opponent
of Hyrcan ever since Herod was tried before
the Sanhedrin for acts committed in Galilee.
lUut on being appointed by his friends to as-
certain the sentiments of Hyrcan as to the
future government of Israel, because the wit-
ness and his friends consider the present
government a violent and unjust imposition
on the people, he did not directly offer to
Hlyrcan the aid of his friends in again
mounting the throne of his fathers, but
would first ascertain his sentiments on the
subjects. Hyrcan, however, expressed such
an aversion to public life, and considered
himself so happy that he could conclude his
days in the peace of private life, that wit-
ness could not propose the wishes of his
friends to the old King. Several interviews
leadi ig to the same result, witness advised
his friends to try no inure, as Hyrcan had
grown too old and weak to be a King.
The advocates of Ilerod examined the
blind man for hours. But it was in vein;
he could not be confused. Ile said the same
thing always again. Without the least to-
ken of fear he stated his objections to the
government of Herod and his wish to see
him dethroned. Hillel declared the evidence
on the part of the defence as concluded.-
Every word of the testimony was known in
Jerusalem, notwithstanding the closed doors
of the Sanhedrin.  Baba ben Buta was
borne in triumph from the Temple to his
house. The forged letter, the hired prose-
lytes and -reatgs of Sabion formed the
common theme of 'conversation. There was
an indignation audible in the' community,

"My venerable father and teachersaid
Simon, "yoe-taught me, to save a human
life is-a moressacred duty than to observe
all-the-Sabbaths of a lifetime., You taught
nye that even, in cae of. doubt--man may
violate the Sabbath, if he believes thus. to
save the life of a human being."
" I did say so, and this is the meaning of
the Law : ' What-man should do to live by
it,' and not to die.with'it. Self-preservation
is man's first duty. 'Love thy neighbor as
thyself,' implies.first the duty to preserve she
life of our fellow men as well as ours. - Hence
the perservation of life ia man's first duty.
But tell me, my son, whose life art thou to
save ?"
"Hyrcan's, my father," said Simon. " I
prevailed so long on Herod until he appoin-
ted me governor of Jerusalem and pardon-
ed Hyrcan. I bear the documents. I can
save the life of Hyrcan and of many others
who die now in Jerusalem almost every day,
for no offence of theirs."
"Thea go, travel fast, be in time in Jeru-
salem, andamay God speed thee," Hillel ex-
claimed, joyfully. " All good men in Israel
will bless thee, and Herod's name might yet
be saved from perdition." Instantly Hillel
looked serious and deliberating. After a
mormept of reflection, he asked, " But why
didst thou not go the straight rout from Pe-
tra to Jerusalem ? "
"Notwithstanding the decrees of the King,
signed by him, gnd bearing his seal,' haid, i-
men, "nothwithstanding my traveliug4h a

men, who evidently obeyed the behests of
Herod. I fear my son, thou art deceived."
Like a flash of lightning it rushed through
the soul of Simon. He rose from his seat
and looked about like one who feels-the ap.
proach of insanity. "Is it possible that He.
rod is do perfidious, so outrageously satanic,
such a feeble, weak, hellish liar I" Simon
exclaimed, furiously. "Yet it appears to be
as my sagacious father says. Herod,-tlien,
dig thy grave, thou art a lost man. This
pardon alone could save him. 0, my fath-
er, my kind father, you know not how my
soul mourns over that Herod, how I dread
the idea of the bloody revolution, that must
ensue. 0, 1 hoped to save him, to spare my
people the lives of the thousand patriots.-
It was. a sweet, pleasant. dream. If Herod
isa-liar,-then the dream is over, and the
sword, the bloody sword will decide the fate
of Israel." Simon covered his face with
his hands and wept so loud, that all in the
room wept with;him. Painful was the si-
lence that followed, and the emotions that
appeared to dominate every heart. Then
he burst forth violently, " Israel, curse the
infamous seducers of Herod ! Israel, curse
Salome, Dositheus, Castobarus, curse Sabi-
on "
The shrill and painful cry of Helen, "Hold
on, for God's sake, hold on, he is-my father!"
directed every look to her. " Simon, save
him, I prithee, save his life, he is my father.

compliments, the King asked, "And Hyr-
can?"
"Is dead and buried," Sabion replied, with
a malicious smile onhis lips. Herod started
back, like one who dreads his own sliadowv.
He appeared to shudder at his own black
deed. "And the people ?" -he continued,
interogating. " Are quiet," said Sabion,
"I have kept my word."
"Quiet, very quiet," said Herod, "not one
of them has a word of joy to speak to the
returning victor."
" My lord, none knew of your arrival,"
Sabion excused himself, "'or else "--
"You would have hired some criers to
give mean enthusiastic reception," the King
interrupted. " It is well, as it is. What
says the Queen ?"
"i can not tell, my lord," said Sabion,
"none is permitted to see her. She is sick'
I presume."
" Yes, yes, she is sick, I presume," said
the King, "and could not receive her royal
husband in due form. Her children, cham-
berlains, courtiers, officers, servants all sick,
I presume, only Sabion and myself are well.
Ha, ha, ha, this is a sickly season.- But
what is the latest news from Egypt?"
" Melancholy intelligence," said Sabion.-.-
" Antony and Cleopatra are dead, they end-
e4 in suicide."                    ,1
Thunderstruck, Herod looked on Sabion,
witbut saying one word. The wild gestures
of'Fthl ing and his rapid strides were the
only-demonasration of his emotions. Grad-
usillyhe wrought himself into a frantic ex-

.it was unsafe to stay anylonger in hiptee

went toward the door. "Stay, traitoe,,faih-

Cleopatra; that vile woman is dead. Why
are you in such a hurry, your business is

and left. "Castobarus, 8abion is youf'jris-
oner. Your honor and your head are for-

Sabion fell upon his knees befor the
King. " My lord, my gracious King,' he
begged, "do not abandon your most faithful
servant. I have done my duty at the risk of
my own life."    .
" Yes, yes, you have done your duty, as
well as any other executioner," the King re-
plied ; " but your work is done. Cleopatra

Without looking on him Simon, pointing
to Salome said,"And to see-his dying sis,
ter."
Herod on observing Salome, asked, sur-
prisedg" What means this 'i"
"Nothing unusual in Herod's palace," Si-
mon, coolly and monotonously, replied.--
"Remorse and shame overpowered her, and
she fainted away. But she willsoon recover
to  dure athousand deaths."  The King bu-
sy     himself to restore her, Simon said:
"or:mercy's sake do not recall her to con-
sciousness. Let her sleep without-a.&amp;dream.
I fyou restore her suddenly her heart might
break under the crushing weight of her guilt.
Behold, King o: Judea, here lies-your sister,
your vile counsellor, here she lies crushed
with remorse; for she killed her own daugh-
ter, and her daughter was an angel. Be-
hold,'King of Judea, she is a'vile, degraded,
dishonored woman, still she is an angel in
comparison with you, even you. She fain-
ted on hearing that shy' murdered her own
child, artd you remained \unshaken when
you heard of the death of tour own fattier,
through your hands."
" Irritate not my anger," Herod roared,
foaming with rage. Salomeigroaned heavi-
ly; and the King attended to her. Simon
continued: "Your anger is quite harmless.
You can only kill me, dispatch me to those
whose blood boils upon your guilty heart.-
Ai, Sire, there are moments in every man's
life when death loses its terror aril life its

Herod raged furiously; but Saleme have

him that he could not give vent to his wrath.
"Let me go, sister, that I may kill that infer-

"My lord, you sent him away with the

Castobarus replied. " He is gone as you

" Then she is gone ?" he asked.
" The Queen, my lord, her mother and the
royal princes are gone, as you commanded,"
said Castobarus.  " They started exactly
three hours ago."
"Did you see them leave?" Herod asked.
"How did the Queen behave? What did
she say? Did she not inquire after me ?-
Speak, did she not mention my name, not a
word, not a single word did she say ?."
" Not a word, my lord," said Castobarus.
" She mounted the carriage, took her child-

Suddenly he turned to Castobarus with
the command " Call Sabion hither, I must
see him." Sabion was ushered into his pres.
ence.
" You are an obstinate sinner," said HE-
rod, "you intended to sell me and Judea to
Cleopatra. But she is dead and you repent.
Is it not so, Sabion ?"
" My lord, I am yours with all my life,"
said Sabion, kneeling before the King.-
" Command and I will die for you, without a
groan."
"Sabion, have you heard of the defeat of
Shemus, by the rebels ?" the King asked.
" I have, my lord," was the reply.
"Sohemus says their number is formida-
ble," the King quothed. " An attack upon
Jerusalem is in contemplation. They can
not take Jerusalem. But they might do us
much harm in the country. What is your
advice, shall I wait until they attack Jerusa-
lem, or shall I go out in person to meet them
in open battle before they concentrate their
forces ?"
"It would not do for the King to fight his
own people," said Sabion. " Your enemies
'n the country are so very few, tat they can
not even bring together men enough to be
called an army. Sohemus went with a few
men to Jericho, and being defeated he con.
ciders the numbers of the enemy formidable.
You are too much feared and respected in
the country to be betrayed by the multitude.
Keep the city safe, concentrate your army
around it, and watch their movements, is my
advice."
"So is my inclination," said Herod.--'
" But f they besiege the city,'what then ?"
" Then you have more than 'the required
forces to drive them to pairs,'' said Sabion.

ante. ered held a council in his palace,
to determine upon the steps to be taken the
nextday. Theydeliberated forseveral hours
and came to the conclusipn, that Zion could
be efectually defended and the rebels could
be subdued yet, to which end 'a plan was
adopted&amp; The King, however, insisted up-
on commanding in person and be prepared
for all eventualities. He commanded Sohe-
mus to leavathe city with an adequate force
pud go to the fort of Alexandrium, where
the Queen and her children were. He com-
manded Soheugus to hold the fort at any
risk. As soon as he should be convinced of
the King's death, he should kill Mariacnne,
her children ander mother. Soheuaus
knelt down and swore a solemn oath to car-
ry out punctually the command of the King.
Before the morning dawned Sohemnus with
his men had left the city, unobserved by the
enemy.
Then the King called Castobaras and
charged him with the duty to convey his
mother Cyprus and his sister Salome to the
fort of Masado, to keep that fort at any
risk, protect the royal family, and in case of
the King's death to proclaim Antipater, the
King's son by his first wife Doris, King of
Israel.

so loudly, that she could not safely be con-

the arrangements had been completed to
convey the royal family out of the city to
the appointed fort, and Salome continued

her mother begged and threatened in vain,
she only became more desperate and furi-
ous with every passing moment. The hours
of the night passing away rapidly, the morn-
ing was fast approaching, no time was to be
lost. Herod commanded to gag her; her
hands tied, her mouth gaged, three men sei-
zed the furious woman, placed her in the
carriage at the side of her mother, and the
whole train, commanded by Castobarus, star-
ted off with the utmost speed, and escaped
without being noticed by the enemy.
Herod almost wept over the agony of his
sister, but he could not help her. Circum-
stances required, that Castobarus should be
tied closely to the royal family, whose chief
interests were plated in his hands. While
he was still lost in a train of painful tho'ts
a servant opened the door and asked shily,
" My lord, what shall be done with the bo-
dy of Elvira, your sister left no orders ?"
Herod shuddered. He covered his eyes
with his left hand and exclaimed, "She is
avenged." Turning after awhile to the ser-
vant he said, " Bury her by the side of Sa-
bion in his family sepulcher." Two large
tears glittered in the eyes of Herod. When
the servant was gone he inadvertantly ex-
claimed, "'There is a God of justice, but He-
rod is lost." : Frightened as it were at his
own words he violently struck the handle of

ed no remark. When the morning dawned
on Mt. Zion, the gates of the city were all
opened, the soldiers fraternized with the
people, and Herod was gone, none knew
whither. The people-shouted with joy, but
the joy was not without tears. In the fort
of Antiochus a guard of honor surrounded
a dead man. He bled from many wounds,
and closing his eyes in death he shouted
yet, " We are victorious."  With awe and
reverence the warriors looked at the dead
Hero, and many a tear coursed down hardy
and sun burnt cheeks.. It was the dead bo-
dy of Abba Shaul, who fell during the storm-
ing of the fort, pierced by the arrows of the
enemy. He died the death of a hero, with
the words of " onward for God and Israel"
on his lips.
In the midst of the excited and joyful
crowds, Helen ran from street to street in
search of Simon, but found him not. De-
spairing and tearless, she arrived at the roy-
al palace where she found the dead bodies
of Elvira and her father. She covered the
countenances of both with tears andkisses,
and lamented over them in mute pain. The
thundering shouts of joy and victory resoun-
ding through the streets disturbed her not.
The warbling of the trumpets to signalize
the people's victory 'alleviated not her pain.
The outbursts of an unlimited enthusiasm
which rent the air of Jerusalem reached'not
Helen's suffering heart. " My father, my
sister," were the only words she could ut-
ter. A voice was heard in the arched halls

of the palace, a voice so well known to Hel-
en. She listened. Again he spoke.. She
opened the door and cried "Simon. Hus-
band, here, heroes your wife," and Simon
heard it, he came and seized her as a hung-
ry lion grasps after the prey. tThen you
live yet, my dearest, only beloved. Helen,"
Simon cried. " In vrain-have I soughtthee,
in vain sent twenty messengers toand thee;
all said you fell on the side of Abba Shaul.
Thank God you live,- you are here, and
mine."
Mute Helen pointed to the dead lying
in the room. Simon pressed Heln on his
heart, and wept with her. Then he com-
manded the servants of Sabion to remove
the bodies to the very sepulchre which He-i-
rod had ordained.
The Passover was a feast of joy and vie-
tory for the people. The happiest days of
Israel appeared to have returned. Also Hel-
en was healed- from her grief by the enthu-
siasm generally prevailing, the love and ten-
derness of: Simon,' who  as overhappy at
the side of his beloved wife, and the pious
consolation of Hillel who, notwithstanding
the numerous congratulations he was obli-
ged to receive, had yet time enough to at-
tend sometimes to his family.
We may meet again with Simon, Helen
and Jonathan ben Uuiel in another story';
but for this time we must part with them,
and bid our readers FAREWELL.
